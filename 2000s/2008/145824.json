Segal, Jay Carlson, Alex Wagner, Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, Preston Gates Ellis LLP, Seattle, WA, for Respondent Washington State Democratic Central Committee.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In 2004, voters in the State of Washington passed an initiative changing the State's primary election system. The People's Choice Initiative of 2004, or Initiative 872 (I-872), provides that candidates for office shall be identified on the ballot by their self-designated \"party preference\"; that voters may vote for any candidate; and that the top two votegetters for each office, regardless of party preference, advance to the general election. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held I-872 facially invalid as imposing an unconstitutional burden on state political parties' First Amendment rights. Because I-872 does not on its face impose a severe burden on political parties' associational rights, and because respondents' arguments to the contrary rest on factual assumptions about voter confusion that can be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>For most of the past century, Washington voters selected nominees for state and local offices using a blanket primary.<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1188</span> From 1935 until 2003, the State used a blanket primary that placed candidates from all parties on one ballot and allowed voters to select a candidate from any party. See 1935 Wash. Laws, ch. \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, pp. 60-64. Under this system, the candidate who won a plurality of votes within each major party became that party's nominee in the general election. See 2003 Wash. Laws, \u00a7 919, p. 775.</p>\n<p>California used a nearly identical primary in its own elections until our decision in <i>California Democratic Party v. Jones,</i> 530 U.S. 567, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000). In <i>Jones,</i> four political parties challenged California's blanket primary, arguing that it unconstitutionally burdened their associational rights by forcing them to associate with voters who did not share their beliefs. We agreed and struck down the blanket primary as inconsistent with the First Amendment. In so doing, we emphasized the importance of the nomination process as \"`the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be translated into concerted action, and hence to political power in the community.' \" <i>Id.,</i> at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (quoting <i>Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn.,</i> 479 U.S. 208, 216, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986)). We observed that a party's right to exclude is central to its freedom of association, and is never \"more important than in the process of selecting its nominee.\" 530 U.S., at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402. California's blanket primary, we concluded, severely burdened the parties' freedom of association because it forced them to allow nonmembers to participate in selecting the parties' nominees. That the parties retained the right to endorse their preferred candidates did not render the burden any less severe, as \"[t]here is simply no substitute for a party's selecting its own candidates.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 581, 120 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n<p>Because California's blanket primary severely burdened the parties' associational rights, we subjected it to strict scrutiny, carefully examining each of the state interests offered by California in support of its primary system. We rejected as illegitimate three of the asserted interests: \"producing elected officials who better represent the electorate,\" \"expanding candidate debate beyond the scope of partisan concerns,\" and ensuring \"the right to an effective vote\" by allowing nonmembers of a party to vote in the majority party's primary in \"`safe'\" districts. <i>Id.,</i> at 582-584, 120 S.Ct. 2402. We concluded that the remaining interests\u0097promoting fairness, affording voters greater choice, increasing voter participation, and protecting privacy\u0097were not compelling on the facts of the case. Even if they were, the partisan California primary was not narrowly tailored to further those interests because a nonpartisan blanket primary, in which the top two votegetters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation, would accomplish each of those interests without burdening the parties' associational rights. <i>Id.,</i> at 585-586, 120 S.Ct. 2402. The nonpartisan blanket primary had \"all the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters [were] not choosing a party's nominee.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>After our decision in <i>Jones,</i> the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1189</span> Washington's primary as \"materially indistinguishable from the California scheme.\" <i>Democratic Party of Washington State v. Reed,</i> 343 F.3d 1198, 1203 (2003). The Washington State Grange<sup>[2]</sup> promptly proposed I-872 as a replacement.<sup>[3]</sup> It passed with nearly 60% of the vote and became effective in December 2004.</p>\n<p>Under I-872, all elections for \"partisan offices\"<sup>[4]</sup> are conducted in two stages: a primary and a general election. To participate in the primary, a candidate must file a \"declaration of candidacy\" form, on which he declares his \"major or minor party preference, or independent status.\" Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 29A.24.030 (Supp.2005). Each candidate and his party preference (or independent status) is in turn designated on the primary election ballot. A political party cannot prevent a candidate who is unaffiliated with, or even repugnant to, the party from designating it as his party of preference. See Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 434-215-015 (2005). In the primary election, voters may select \"any candidate listed on the ballot, regardless of the party preference of the candidates or the voter.\" \u00a7 434-262-012.</p>\n<p>The candidates with the highest and second-highest vote totals advance to the general election, regardless of their party preferences. <i>Ibid.</i> Thus, the general election may pit two candidates with the same party preference against one another.<sup>[5]</sup> Each candidate's party preference is listed on the general election ballot, and may not be changed between the primary and general elections. See \u00a7 434-230-040.</p>\n<p>Immediately after the State enacted regulations to implement I-872, the Washington State Republican Party filed suit against a number of county auditors challenging the law on its face. The party contended that the new system violates its associational rights by usurping its right to nominate its own candidates and by forcing it to associate with candidates it does not endorse. The Washington State Democratic Central Committee and Libertarian Party of Washington State joined the suit as plaintiffs. The Washington State Grange joined as a defendant, and the State of Washington was substituted for the county auditors as defendant. The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington granted the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1190</span> political parties' motions for summary judgment and enjoined the implementation of I-872. See <i>Washington State Republican Party v. Logan,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d 907, 932 (2005).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed. 460 F.3d 1108, 1125 (C.A.9 2006). It held that the I-872 primary severely burdens the political parties' associational rights because the party-preference designation on the ballot creates a risk that primary winners will be perceived as the parties' nominees and produces an \"impression of associatio[n]\" between a candidate and his party of preference even when the party does not associate, or wish to be associated, with the candidate. <i>Id.,</i> at 1119. The Court of Appeals noted a \"constitutionally significant distinction between ballots and other vehicles for political expression,\" reasoning that the risk of perceived association is particularly acute when ballots include party labels because such labels are typically used to designate candidates' views on issues of public concern. <i>Id.,</i> at 1121. And it determined that the State's interests underlying I-872 were not sufficiently compelling to justify the severe burden on the parties' association. Concluding that the provisions of I-872 providing for the party-preference designation on the ballot were not severable, the court struck down I-872 in its entirety.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1373, 167 L.Ed.2d 158 (2007), to determine whether I-872, on its face, violates the political parties' associational rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Respondents object to I-872 not in the context of an actual election, but in a facial challenge. Under <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987), a plaintiff can only succeed in a facial challenge by \"establish[ing] that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid,\" <i>i.e.,</i> that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications. <i>Id.,</i> at 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095. While some Members of the Court have criticized the <i>Salerno</i> formulation, all agree that a facial challenge must fail where the statute has a \"`plainly legitimate sweep.'\" <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> 521 U.S. 702, 739-740, and n. 7, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgments). Washington's primary system survives under either standard, as we explain below.<sup>[6]</sup> In determining whether a law is facially invalid, we must be careful not to go beyond the statute's facial requirements and speculate about \"hypothetical\" or \"imaginary\" cases. See <i>United States v. Raines,</i> 362 U.S. 17, 22, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) (\"The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined\"). The State has had no opportunity to implement I-872, and its courts have had no occasion to construe the law in the context of actual disputes arising from the electoral context, or to accord the law a limiting construction to avoid constitutional questions. Cf. <i>Yazoo</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1191</span> <i>&amp; Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Jackson Vinegar Co.,</i> 226 U.S. 217, 220, 33 S.Ct. 40, 57 L.Ed. 193 (1912) (\"How the state court may apply [a statute] to other cases, whether its general words may be treated as more or less restrained, and how far parts of it may be sustained if others fail are matters upon which we need not speculate now\"). Exercising judicial restraint in a facial challenge \"frees the Court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.\" <i>Raines, supra,</i> at 22, 80 S.Ct. 519.</p>\n<p>Facial challenges are disfavored for several reasons. Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation. As a consequence, they raise the risk of \"premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\" <i>Sabri v. United States,</i> 541 U.S. 600, 609, 124 S.Ct. 1941, 158 L.Ed.2d 891 (2004) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Facial challenges also run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither \"`anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it'\" nor \"`formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'\" <i>Ashwander v. TVA,</i> 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (quoting <i>Liverpool, New York &amp; Philadelphia S.S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration,</i> 113 U.S. 33, 39, 5 S.Ct. 352, 28 L.Ed. 899 (1885)). Finally, facial challenges threaten to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution. We must keep in mind that \"`[a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people.'\" <i>Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,</i> 546 U.S. 320, 329, 126 S.Ct. 961, 163 L.Ed.2d 812 (2006) (quoting <i>Regan v. Time, Inc.,</i> 468 U.S. 641, 652, 104 S.Ct. 3262, 82 L.Ed.2d 487 (1984) (plurality opinion)). It is with these principles in view that we turn to the merits of respondents' facial challenge to I-872.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The States possess a \"`broad power to prescribe the \"Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,\" Art. I, \u00a7 4, cl. 1, which power is matched by state control over the election process for state offices.' \" <i>Clingman v. Beaver,</i> 544 U.S. 581, 586, 125 S.Ct. 2029, 161 L.Ed.2d 920 (2005) (quoting <i>Tashjian,</i> 479 U.S., at 217, 107 S.Ct. 544); <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> 520 U.S. 351, 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997) (same). This power is not absolute, but is \"subject to the limitation that [it] may not be exercised in a way that violates . . . specific provisions of the Constitution.\" <i>Williams v. Rhodes,</i> 393 U.S. 23, 29, 89 S.Ct. 5, 21 L.Ed.2d 24 (1968). In particular, the State has the \"`responsibility to observe the limits established by the First Amendment rights of the State's citizens,'\" including the freedom of political association. <i>Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. 214, 222, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (quoting <i>Tashjian, supra,</i> at 217, 107 S.Ct. 544).</p>\n<p>Election regulations that impose a severe burden on associational rights are subject to strict scrutiny, and we uphold them only if they are \"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\" <i>Clingman, supra,</i> at 586, 125 S.Ct. 2029; see also <i>Rhodes, supra,</i> at 31, 89 S.Ct. 5 (\"`only a compelling state interest in the regulation of a subject within the State's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1192</span> constitutional power to regulate can justify limiting First Amendment freedoms'\" (quoting <i>NAACP v. Button,</i> 371 U.S. 415, 438, 83 S.Ct. 328, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963))). If a statute imposes only modest burdens, however, then \"the State's important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\" on election procedures. <i>Anderson v. Celebrezze,</i> 460 U.S. 780, 788, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983). \"Accordingly, we have repeatedly upheld reasonable, politically neutral regulations that have the effect of channeling expressive activity at the polls.\" <i>Burdick v. Takushi,</i> 504 U.S. 428, 438, 112 S.Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992).</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute these general principles; rather, they disagree about whether I-872 severely burdens respondents' associational rights. That disagreement begins with <i>Jones.</i> Petitioners argue that the I-872 primary is indistinguishable from the alternative <i>Jones</i> suggested would be constitutional. In <i>Jones</i> we noted that a nonpartisan blanket primary, where the top two votegetters proceed to the general election regardless of their party, was a less restrictive alternative to California's system because such a primary does not nominate candidates. 530 U.S., at 585-586, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (The nonpartisan blanket primary \"has all the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a party's nominee\"). Petitioners are correct that we assumed that the nonpartisan primary we described in <i>Jones</i> would be constitutional. But that is not dispositive here because we had no occasion in <i>Jones</i> to determine whether a primary system that indicates each candidate's party preference on the ballot, in effect, chooses the parties' nominees.</p>\n<p>That question is now squarely before us. Respondents argue that I-872 is unconstitutional under <i>Jones</i> because it has the same \"constitutionally crucial\" infirmity that doomed California's blanket primary: it allows primary voters who are unaffiliated with a party to choose the party's nominee. Respondents claim that candidates who progress to the general election under I-872 will become the <i>de facto</i> nominees of the parties they prefer, thereby violating the parties' right to choose their own standard-bearers, see <i>Timmons, supra,</i> at 359, 117 S.Ct. 1364, and altering their messages. They rely on our statement in <i>Jones</i> reaffirming \"the special place the First Amendment reserves for, and the special protection it accords, the process by which a political party `select[s] a standard bearer who best represents the party's ideologies and preferences.'\" <i>Jones,</i> 530 U.S., at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (quoting <i>Eu, supra,</i> at 224, 109 S.Ct. 1013).</p>\n<p>The flaw in this argument is that, unlike the California primary, the I-872 primary does not, by its terms, choose parties' nominees. The essence of nomination\u0097the choice of a party representative\u0097does not occur under I-872. The law never refers to the candidates as nominees of any party, nor does it treat them as such. To the contrary, the election regulations specifically provide that the primary \"does not serve to determine the nominees of a political party but serves to winnow the number of candidates to a final list of two for the general election.\" Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 434-262-012. The top two candidates from the primary election proceed to the general election regardless of their party preferences. Whether parties nominate their own candidates outside the state-run primary is simply irrelevant. In fact, parties may now nominate candidates by whatever mechanism they choose because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1193</span> I-872 repealed Washington's prior regulations governing party nominations.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondents counter that, even if the I-872 primary does not actually choose parties' nominees, it nevertheless burdens their associational rights because voters will assume that candidates on the general election ballot are the nominees of their preferred parties. This brings us to the heart of respondents' case\u0097and to the fatal flaw in their argument. At bottom, respondents' objection to I-872 is that voters will be confused by candidates' partypreference designations. Respondents' arguments are largely variations on this theme. Thus, they argue that even if voters do not assume that candidates on the general election ballot are the nominees of their parties, they will at least assume that the parties associate with, and approve of, them. This, they say, compels them to associate with candidates they do not endorse, alters the messages they wish to convey, and forces them to engage in counterspeech to disassociate themselves from the candidates and their positions on the issues.</p>\n<p>We reject each of these contentions for the same reason: They all depend, not on any facial requirement of I-872, but on the possibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning of the party-preference designation. But respondents' assertion that voters will misinterpret the partypreference designation is sheer speculation. It \"depends upon the belief that voters can be `misled' by party labels. But `[o]ur cases reflect a greater faith in the ability of individual voters to inform themselves about campaign issues.'\" <i>Tashjian,</i> 479 U.S., at 220, 107 S.Ct. 544 (quoting <i>Anderson,</i> 460 U.S., at 797, 103 S.Ct. 1564). There is simply no basis to presume that a well-informed electorate will interpret a candidate's party-preference designation to mean that the candidate is the party's chosen nominee or representative or that the party associates with or approves of the candidate. See <i>New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,</i> 487 U.S. 1, 13-14, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (rejecting a facial challenge to a law regulating club membership and noting that \"[w]e could hardly hold otherwise on the record before us, which contains no specific evidence on the characteristics of <i>any</i> club covered by the [l]aw\"). This strikes us as especially true here, given that it was the voters of Washington themselves, rather than their elected representatives, who enacted I-872.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is <i>possible</i> that voters will misinterpret the candidates' party-preference designations as reflecting endorsement by the parties. But these cases involve a facial challenge, and we cannot strike down I-872 on its face based on the mere possibility of voter confusion. See <i>Yazoo,</i> 226 U.S., at 219, 33 S.Ct. 40 (\"[T]his court must deal with the case in hand and not with imaginary ones\"); <i>Pullman Co. v. Knott,</i> 235 U.S. 23, 26, 35 S.Ct. 2, 59 L.Ed. 105 (1914) (A statute \"is not to be upset upon hypothetical and unreal possibilities, if it would be good upon the facts as they are\"). Because respondents brought their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1194</span> suit as a facial challenge, we have no evidentiary record against which to assess their assertions that voters will be confused. See <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S., at 375-376, 117 S.Ct. 1364 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (rejecting judgments based on \"imaginative theoretical sources of voter confusion\" and \"entirely hypothetical\" outcomes). Indeed, because I-872 has never been implemented, we do not even have ballots indicating how party preference will be displayed. It stands to reason that whether voters will be confused by the party-preference designations will depend in significant part on the form of the ballot. The Court of Appeals assumed that the ballot would not place abbreviations like \"`D'\" and \"`R,'\" or \"`Dem.'\" and \"`Rep.'\" after the names of candidates, but would instead \"clearly state that a particular candidate `prefers' a particular party.\" 460 F.3d, at 1121, n. 20. It thought that even such a clear statement did too little to eliminate the risk of voter confusion.</p>\n<p>But we see no reason to stop there. As long as we are speculating about the form of the ballot\u0097and we can do no more than speculate in this facial challenge\u0097we must, in fairness to the voters of the State of Washington who enacted I-872 and in deference to the executive and judicial officials who are charged with implementing it, ask whether the ballot could conceivably be printed in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of widespread voter confusion and with it the perceived threat to the First Amendment. See <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 329, 126 S.Ct. 961 (noting that courts should not nullify more of a state law than necessary so as to avoid frustrating the intent of the people and their duly elected representatives); <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> 491 U.S. 781, 795-796, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) (\"`[I]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.'\" (quoting <i>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 489, 494, n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982))).</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to conceive of such a ballot. For example, petitioners propose that the actual I-872 ballot could include prominent disclaimers explaining that party preference reflects only the self-designation of the candidate and not an official endorsement by the party. They also suggest that the ballots might note preference in the form of a candidate statement that emphasizes the candidate's personal determination rather than the party's acceptance of the candidate, such as \"my party preference is the Republican Party.\" Additionally, the State could decide to educate the public about the new primary ballots through advertising or explanatory materials mailed to voters along with their ballots.<sup>[8]</sup> We are satisfied that there are a variety of ways in which the State could implement I-872 that would eliminate any real threat of voter confusion. And without the specter of widespread voter confusion, respondents' arguments about forced association<sup>[9]</sup> and compelled speech<sup>[10]</sup> fall flat.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1195</span> Our conclusion that these implementations of I-872 would be consistent with the First Amendment is fatal to respondents' facial challenge. See <i>Schall v. Martin,</i> 467 U.S. 253, 264, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984) (a facial challenge fails where \"at least some\" constitutional applications exist). Each of their arguments rests on factual assumptions about voter confusion, and each fails for the same reason: In the absence of evidence, we cannot assume that Washington's voters will be misled. See <i>Jones,</i> 530 U.S., at 600, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"[A]n empirically debatable assumption . . . is too thin a reed to support a credible First Amendment distinction\" between permissible and impermissible burdens on association). That factual determination must await an as-applied challenge. On its face, I-872 does not impose any severe burden on respondents' associational rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Because we have concluded that I-872 does not severely burden respondents, the State need not assert a compelling interest. See <i>Clingman,</i> 544 U.S., at 593, 125 S.Ct. 2029 (\"When a state electoral provision places no heavy burden on associational rights, `a State's important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions'\" (quoting <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S., at 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364)). The State's asserted interest in providing voters with relevant information about the candidates on the ballot is easily sufficient to sustain I-872. See <i>Anderson,</i> 460 U.S., at 796, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (\"There can be no question about the legitimacy of the State's interest in fostering informed and educated expressions of the popular will in a general election\").<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondents ask this Court to invalidate a popularly enacted election process that has never been carried out. Immediately after implementing regulations were enacted, respondents obtained a permanent injunction against the enforcement of I-872. The First Amendment does not require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1196</span> this extraordinary and precipitous nullification of the will of the people. Because I-872 does not on its face provide for the nomination of candidates or compel political parties to associate with or endorse candidates, and because there is no basis in this facial challenge for presuming that candidates' party-preference designations will confuse voters, I-872 does not on its face severely burden respondents' associational rights. We accordingly hold that I-872 is facially constitutional. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I share Justice SCALIA's concern that permitting a candidate to identify his political party preference on an official election ballot\u0097regardless of whether the candidate is endorsed by the party or is even a member\u0097may effectively force parties to accept candidates they do not want, amounting to forced association in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>I do think, however, that whether voters <i>perceive</i> the candidate and the party to be associated is relevant to the constitutional inquiry. Our other forced-association cases indicate as much. In <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> 530 U.S. 640, 653, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000), we said that Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would \"force the organization to send a message . . . [to] the world\" that the Scouts approved of homosexuality. In other words, accepting Dale would lead outsiders to believe the Scouts endorsed homosexual conduct. Largely for that reason, we held that the First Amendment entitled the Scouts to exclude Dale. <i>Id.,</i> at 659, 120 S.Ct. 2446. Similarly, in <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995), we allowed the organizers of Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade to exclude a pro-gay rights float because the float's presence in the parade might create the impression that the organizers agreed with the float-sponsors' message. See <i>id.,</i> at 575-577, 115 S.Ct. 2338.</p>\n<p>Voter perceptions matter, and if voters do not actually believe the parties and the candidates are tied together, it is hard to see how the parties' associational rights are adversely implicated. See <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> 547 U.S. 47, 65, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006) (rejecting law schools' First Amendment objection to military recruiters on campus because no reasonable person would believe the \"law schools agree[d] with any speech by recruiters\"). After all, individuals frequently claim to favor this or that political party; these preferences, without more, do not create an unconstitutional forced association.</p>\n<p>What makes these cases different, as Justice SCALIA explains, is the place where the candidates express their party preferences: on the ballot. See <i>post,</i> at 1199 (dissenting opinion) (noting \"the special role that a state-printed ballot plays in elections\"). And what makes the ballot \"special\" is precisely the effect it has on voter impressions. See <i>Cook v. Gralike,</i> 531 U.S. 510, 532, 121 S.Ct. 1029, 149 L.Ed.2d 44 (2001) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment) (\"[T]he ballot . . . is the last thing the voter sees before he makes his choice\"); <i>Anderson v. Martin,</i> 375 U.S. 399, 402, 84 S.Ct. 454, 11 L.Ed.2d 430 (1964) (\"[D]irecting the citizen's attention to the single consideration of race . . . may decisively influence the citizen to cast his ballot along racial lines\").</p>\n<p>But because respondents brought this challenge before the State of Washington had printed ballots for use under the new <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1197</span> primary regime, we have no idea what those ballots will look like. Petitioners themselves emphasize that the content of the ballots in the pertinent respect is yet to be determined. See Reply Brief for Washington State Grange 2-4, 7-13.</p>\n<p>If the ballot is designed in such a manner that no reasonable voter would believe that the candidates listed there are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated with, the parties the candidates claimed to \"prefer,\" the I-872 primary system would likely pass constitutional muster. I cannot say on the present record that it would be impossible for the State to design such a ballot. Assuming the ballot is so designed, voters would not regard the listed candidates as \"party\" candidates, any more than someone saying \"I like Campbell's soup\" would be understood to be associated with Campbell's. Voters would understand that the candidate does not speak on the party's behalf or with the party's approval. On the other hand, if the ballot merely lists the candidates' preferred parties next to the candidates' names, or otherwise fails clearly to convey that the parties and the candidates are not necessarily associated, the I-872 system would not survive a First Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA complains that \"[i]t is hard to know how to respond\" to such mistaken views, <i>post,</i> at 1200 (dissenting opinion), but he soldiers on nonetheless. He would hold that a party is burdened by a candidate's statement of preference even if no reasonable voter believes from the ballot that the party and the candidate are associated. I take his point to be that a particular candidate's \"endorsement\" of a party might alter the party's message, and this violates the party's freedom of association. See <i>post,</i> at 1200-1201 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>But there is no general right to stop an individual from saying, \"I prefer this party,\" even if the party would rather he not. Normally, the party protects its message in such a case through responsive speech of its own. What makes this case different of course is that the State controls the content of the ballot, which we have never considered a public forum. See <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> 520 U.S. 351, 363, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997) (ballots are not \"forums for political expression\"). Neither the candidate nor the party dictates the message conveyed by the ballot. In such a case, it is important to know what the ballot actually says\u0097both about the candidate and about the party's association with the candidate. It is possible that no reasonable voter in Washington State will regard the listed candidates as members of, or otherwise associated with, the political parties the candidates claim to prefer. Nothing in my analysis requires the parties to produce studies regarding voter perceptions on this score, but I would wait to see what the ballot says before deciding whether it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Still, I agree with Justice SCALIA that the history of the challenged law suggests the State is not particularly interested in devising ballots that meet these constitutional requirements. See <i>post,</i> at 1201 (dissenting opinion). But this record simply does not allow us to say with certainty that the election system created by I-872 is unconstitutional. Accordingly, I agree with the Court that respondents' present challenge to the law must fail, and I join the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The electorate's perception of a political party's beliefs is colored by its perception of those who support the party; and a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1198</span> party's defining act is the selection of a candidate and advocacy of that candidate's election by conferring upon him the party's endorsement. When the state-printed ballot for the general election causes a party to be associated with candidates who may not fully (if at all) represent its views, it undermines both these vital aspects of political association. The views of the self-identified party supporter color perception of the party's message, and that self-identification on the ballot, with no space for party repudiation or party identification of its own candidate, impairs the party's advocacy of its standard bearer. Because Washington has not demonstrated that this severe burden upon parties' associational rights is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest\u0097indeed, because it seems to me Washington's only plausible interest is precisely to reduce the effectiveness of political parties\u0097I would find the law unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>I begin with the principles on which the Court and I agree. States may not use election regulations to undercut political parties' freedoms of speech or association. See <i>U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,</i> 514 U.S. 779, 833-834, 115 S.Ct. 1842, 131 L.Ed.2d 881 (1995). Thus, when a State regulates political parties as a part of its election process, we consider \"the `character and magnitude'\" of the burden imposed on the party's associational rights and \"the extent to which the State's concerns make the burden necessary.\" <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> 520 U.S. 351, 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997). Regulations imposing severe burdens must be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Among the First Amendment rights that political parties possess is the right to associate with the persons whom they choose and to refrain from associating with persons whom they reject. <i>Democratic Party of </i><i>United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette,</i> 450 U.S. 107, 122, 101 S.Ct. 1010, 67 L.Ed.2d 82 (1981). Also included is the freedom to choose and promote the \"`standard bearer who best represents the party's ideologies and preferences.'\" <i>Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. 214, 224, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).</p>\n<p>When an expressive organization is compelled to associate with a person whose views the group does not accept, the organization's message is undermined; the organization is understood to embrace, or at the very least tolerate, the views of the persons linked with them. We therefore held, for example, that a State severely burdened the right of expressive association when it required the Boy Scouts to accept an openly gay scoutmaster. The scoutmaster's presence \"would, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.\" <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> 530 U.S. 640, 653, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000).</p>\n<p>A political party's expressive mission is not simply, or even primarily, to persuade voters of the party's views. Parties seek principally to promote the election of candidates who will implement those views. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn.,</i> 479 U.S. 208, 216, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986); <i>Storer v. Brown,</i> 415 U.S. 724, 745, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974); M. Hershey &amp; P. Beck, Party Politics in America 13 (10th ed.2003). That is achieved in large part by marking candidates with the party's seal of approval. Parties devote substantial resources to making their names trusted symbols of certain approaches to governance. See, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1199</span> e.g., <i>App. 239 (Declaration of Democratic Committee Chair Paul J. Berendt); J. Aldrich, Why Parties? 48-49 (1995). They then encourage voters to cast their votes for the candidates that carry the party name. Parties' efforts to support candidates by marking them with the party trademark, so to speak, have been successful enough to make the party name, in the words of one commentator, \"the most important resource that the party possesses.\" Cain, Party Autonomy and Two-Party Electoral Competition, 149 U. Pa. L.Rev. 793, 804 (2001). And all evidence suggests party labels are indeed a central consideration for most voters. See,</i> e.g., id., <i>at 804, n. 34; Rahn, The Role of Partisan Stereotypes in Information Processing About Political Candidates, 37 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 472 (1993); Klein &amp; Baum, Ballot Information and Voting Decisions in Judicial Elections, 54 Pol. Research Q. 709 (2001).</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The State of Washington need not like, and need not favor, political parties. It is entirely free to decline running primaries for the selection of party nominees and to hold nonpartisan general elections in which party labels have no place on the ballot. See <i>California Democratic Party v. Jones,</i> 530 U.S. 567, 585-586, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000). Parties would then be left to their own devices in both selecting and publicizing their candidates. But Washington has done more than merely decline to make its electoral machinery available for party building. Recognizing that parties draw support for their candidates by giving them the party imprimatur, Washington seeks to reduce the effectiveness of that endorsement by allowing <i>any</i> candidate to use the ballot for drawing upon the goodwill that a party has developed, while preventing the party from using the ballot to reject the claimed association or to identify the genuine candidate of its choice. This does not merely place the ballot off limits for party building; it makes the ballot an instrument by which party building is impeded, permitting unrebutted associations that the party itself does not approve.</p>\n<p>These cases cannot be decided without taking account of the special role that a state-printed ballot plays in elections. The ballot comes into play \"at the most crucial stage in the electoral process\u0097the instant before the vote is cast.\" <i>Anderson v. Martin,</i> 375 U.S. 399, 402, 84 S.Ct. 454, 11 L.Ed.2d 430 (1964). It is the only document that all voters are guaranteed to see, and it is \"the last thing the voter sees before he makes his choice,\" <i>Cook v. Gralike,</i> 531 U.S. 510, 532, 121 S.Ct. 1029, 149 L.Ed.2d 44 (2001) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment). Thus, we have held that a State cannot elevate a particular issue to prominence by making it the only issue for which the ballot sets forth the candidates' positions. <i>Id.,</i> at 525-526, 121 S.Ct. 1029 (opinion of the Court). And we held unconstitutional California's election system, which listed as the party's candidate on the general election ballot the candidate selected in a state-run \"blanket primary\" in which all citizens could determine who would be the party's nominee. <i>Jones,</i> 530 U.S., at 586, 120 S.Ct. 2402. It was not enough to sustain the law that the party remained free to select its preferred candidate through another process, and could denounce or campaign against the candidate carrying the party's name on the general election ballot. Forced association with the party on the general election ballot was fatal. <i>Id.,</i> at 575-577, 120 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n<p>The Court makes much of the fact that the party names shown on the Washington ballot may be billed as mere statements of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1200</span> candidate \"preference.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1193-1195. To be sure, the party is not <i>itself</i> forced to display favor for someone it does not wish to associate with, as the Boy Scouts were arguably forced to do by employing the homosexual scoutmaster in <i>Dale,</i> and as the political parties were arguably forced to do by lending their ballot-endorsement as party nominee in <i>Jones.</i> But thrusting an unwelcome, self-proclaimed association upon the party on the election ballot itself is amply destructive of the party's associational rights. An individual's endorsement of a party shapes the voter's view of what the party stands for, no less than the party's endorsement of an individual shapes the voter's view of what the individual stands for. That is why party nominees are often asked (and regularly agree) to repudiate the support of persons regarded as racial extremists. On Washington's ballot, such repudiation is impossible. And because the ballot is the only document voters are guaranteed to see, and the last thing they see before casting their vote, there is \"no means of replying\" that \"would be equally effective with the voter.\" <i>Cook, supra,</i> at 532, 121 S.Ct. 1029 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Not only is the party's message distorted, but its goodwill is hijacked. There can be no dispute that candidate acquisition of party labels on Washington's ballot\u0097even if billed as self-identification\u0097is a means of garnering the support of those who trust and agree with the party. The \"I prefer the D's\" and \"I prefer the R's\" will not be on the ballot for esthetic reasons; they are designed to link candidates to unwilling parties (or at least parties who are unable to express their revulsion) and to encourage voters to cast their ballots based in part on the trust they place in the party's name and the party's philosophy. These harms will be present no matter how Washington's law is implemented. There is therefore \"no set of circumstances\" under which Washington's law would not severely burden political parties, see <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987), and no good reason to wait until Washington has undermined its political parties to declare that it is forbidden to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE would wait to see if the law is implemented in a manner that no more harms political parties than allowing a person to state that he \"`like[s] Campbell's soup'\" would harm the Campbell Soup Company. See <i>ante,</i> at 1188 (concurring opinion). It is hard to know how to respond. First and most fundamentally, there is simply no comparison between statements of \"preference\" for an expressive association and statements of \"preference\" for soup. The robust First Amendment freedom to associate belongs only to groups \"engage[d] in `expressive association,'\" <i>Dale,</i> 530 U.S., at 648, 120 S.Ct. 2446. The Campbell Soup Company does not exist to promote a message, and \"there is only minimal constitutional protection of the freedom of <i>commercial</i> association,\" <i>Roberts v. United States Jaycees,</i> 468 U.S. 609, 634, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Second, I assuredly do not share THE CHIEF JUSICE's view that the First Amendment will be satisfied so long as the ballot \"is designed in such a manner that no reasonable voter would believe that the candidates listed there are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated with, the parties the candidates claimed to `prefer.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1188. To begin with, it seems to me quite impossible for the ballot to satisfy a reasonable voter that the candidate is not \"associated with\" the party for which he has expressed a preference. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1201</span> He has associated <i>himself</i> with the party by his very expression of a preference\u0097 and that indeed is the whole purpose of allowing the preference to be expressed. If all The Chief Justice means by \"associated with\" is that the candidate \"does not speak on the party's behalf or with the party's approval,\" <i>ibid.,</i> none of my analysis in this opinion relies upon that misperception, nor upon the misperception that the candidate is a member or the nominee of the party. Avoiding those misperceptions is far from enough. Is it enough to say on the ballot that a notorious and despised racist who says that the party is his choice does not speak with the party's approval? Surely not. His unrebutted association of that party with his views distorts the image of the party nonetheless. And the fact that the candidate who expresses a \"preference\" for one or another party is shown not to be the nominee of that party does not deprive him of the boost from the party's reputation which the party wishes to confer only on its nominee. The Chief Justice claims that \"the content of the ballots in the pertinent respect is yet to be determined,\" <i>ibid.</i> I disagree. We know all we need to know about the form of ballot. When pressed, Washington's Attorney General assured us at oral argument that the ballot will <i>not</i> say whether the party for whom the candidate expresses a preference claims or disavows him. (Of course it will not, for that would enable the party expression that it is the very object of this legislation to impair.)</p>\n<p>And finally, while THE CHIEF JUSTICE earlier expresses his awareness that the special character of the ballot is what makes these cases different, <i>ante,</i> at 1188, his Campbell's Soup example seems to forget that. If we must speak in terms of soup, Washington's law is like a law that encourages Oscar the Grouch (Sesame Street's famed bad-taste resident of a garbage can) to state a \"preference\" for Campbell's at every point of sale, while barring the soup company from disavowing his endorsement, or indeed using its name at all, in those same crucial locations. Reserving the most critical communications forum for statements of \"preference\" by a potentially distasteful speaker alters public perceptions of the entity that is \"preferred\"; and when this privileged connection undermines not a company's ability to identify and promote soup but an expressive association's ability to identify and promote its message and its standard bearer, the State treads on the constitutionally protected freedom of association.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion and THE CHIEF JUSTICE's concurrence also endorse a wait-and-see approach on the grounds that it is not yet evident how the law will affect voter perception of the political parties. But contrary to the Court's suggestion, it is not incumbent on the political parties to adduce \"evidence,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1195, that forced association affects their ability to advocate for their candidates and their causes. We have never put expressive groups to this perhaps-impossible task. Rather, we accept their own assessments of the matter. The very cases on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE relies for a wait-and-see approach, <i>ante,</i> at 1187-1188, establish as much. In <i>Dale,</i> for example, we did not require the Boy Scouts to prove that forced acceptance of the openly homosexual scoutmaster would distort their message. See 530 U.S., at 653, 120 S.Ct. 2446 (citing <i>La Follette,</i> 450 U.S., at 123-124, 101 S.Ct. 1010). Nor in <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995), did we require the organizers of the St. Patrick's Day Parade to demonstrate that including a gay contingent in the parade would distort their message. See <i>id.,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1202</span> 577, 115 S.Ct. 2338. Nor in <i>Jones,</i> 530 U.S. 567, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502, did we require the political parties to demonstrate either that voters would incorrectly perceive the \"nominee\" labels on the ballot to be the products of party elections or that the labels would change voter perceptions of the party. It does not take a study to establish that when statements of party connection are the sole information listed next to candidate names on the ballot, those statements will affect voters' perceptions of what the candidate stands for, what the party stands for, and whom they should elect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Since I conclude that Washington's law imposes a severe burden on political parties' associational rights, I would uphold the law only if it were \"narrowly tailored\" to advance \"a compelling state interest.\" <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S., at 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364. Neither the Court's opinion nor the State's submission claims that Washington's law passes such scrutiny. The State argues only that it \"has a rational basis\" for \"providing voters with a modicum of relevant information about the candidates,\" Brief for Petitioners in No. 06-730, pp. 48-49. This is the only interest the Court's opinion identifies as well. <i>Ante,</i> at 1195.</p>\n<p>But \"rational basis\" is the <i>least</i> demanding of our tests; it is the same test that allows individuals to be taxed at different rates because they are in different businesses. See <i>Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers,</i> 358 U.S. 522, 526-527, 79 S.Ct. 437, 3 L.Ed.2d 480 (1959). It falls far, far short of establishing the compelling state interest that the First Amendment requires. And to tell the truth, here even the existence of a rational basis is questionable. Allowing candidates to identify themselves with particular parties on the ballot displays the State's view that adherence to party philosophy is \"an important\u0097perhaps paramount\u0097consideration in the citizen's choice.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 375 U.S., at 402, 84 S.Ct. 454. If that is so, however, it seems to me irrational not to allow the party to disclaim that self-association, or to identify its own endorsed candidate.</p>\n<p>It is no mystery what is going on here. There is no state interest behind this law except the Washington Legislature's dislike for bright-colors partisanship, and its desire to blunt the ability of political parties with noncentrist views to endorse and advocate their own candidates. That was the purpose of the Washington system that this enactment was adopted to replace\u0097a system indistinguishable from the one we invalidated in <i>Jones,</i> which required parties to allow nonmembers to join in the selection of the candidates shown as their nominees on the election ballot. (The system was held unconstitutional in <i>Democratic Party of Washington State v. Reed,</i> 343 F.3d 1198 (C.A.9 2003).) And it is the obvious purpose of Washington legislation enacted after this law, which requires political parties to repeat a candidate's self-declared party \"preference\" in electioneering communications concerning the candidate\u0097even if the purpose of the communication is to criticize the candidate and to disavow any connection between him and the party. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 42.17.510(1) (2006); see also Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 390-18-020 (2007).</p>\n<p>Even if I were to assume, however, that Washington has a legitimate interest in telling voters on the ballot (above all other things) that a candidate <i>says</i> he favors a particular political party; and even if I were further to assume <i>(per impossibile)</i> that that interest was a compelling one; Washington would still have to \"narrowly tailor\" its law to protect that interest with minimal intrusion upon the parties' associational <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1203</span> rights. There has been no attempt to do that here. Washington could, for example, have permitted parties to disclaim on the general-election ballot the asserted association or to designate on the ballot their true nominees. The course the State has chosen makes sense only as an effort to use its monopoly power over the ballot to undermine the expressive activities of the political parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The right to associate for the election of candidates is fundamental to the operation of our political system, and state action impairing that association bears a heavy burden of justification. Washington's electoral system permits individuals to appropriate the parties' trademarks, so to speak, at the most crucial stage of election, thereby distorting the parties' messages and impairing their endorsement of candidates. The State's justification for this (to convey a \"modicum of relevant information\") is not only weak but undeserving of credence. We have here a system which, like the one it replaced, does not merely refuse to assist, but positively impairs, the legitimate role of political parties. I dissent from the Court's conclusion that the Constitution permits this sabotage.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The term \"blanket primary\" refers to a system in which \"any person, regardless of party affiliation, may vote for a party's nominee.\" <i>California Democratic Party v. Jones,</i> 530 U.S. 567, 576, n. 6, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000). A blanket primary is distinct from an \"open primary,\" in which a person may vote for any party's nominees, but must choose among that party's nominees for all offices, <i>ibid.,</i> and the more traditional \"closed primary\" in which \"only persons who are members of the political party . . . can vote on its nominee,\" <i>id.,</i> at 570, 120 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Washington State Grange is a fraternal, social, and civic organization chartered by the National Grange in 1889. Although originally formed to represent the interests of farmers, the organization has advocated a variety of goals, including women's suffrage, rural electrification, protection of water resources, and universal telephone service. The State Grange also supported the Washington constitutional amendment establishing initiatives and referendums and sponsored the 1934 blanket primary initiative.</p>\n<p>[3]  Respondents make much of the fact that the promoters of I-872 presented it to Washington voters as a way to preserve the primary system in place from 1935 to 2003. But our task is not to judge I-872 based on its promoters' assertions about its similarity, or lack thereof, to the unconstitutional primary; we must evaluate the constitutionality of I-872 on its own terms. Whether the language of I-872 was purposely drafted to survive a <i>Jones</i>-type constitutional challenge is irrelevant to whether it has successfully done so.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"`Partisan office' means a public office for which a candidate may indicate a political party preference on his or her declaration of candidacy and have that preference appear on the primary and general election ballot in conjunction with his or her name.\" Wash.

The Court of Appeals observed that, had the 1996 gubernatorial primary been conducted under the I-872 system, two Democratic candidates and no Republican candidate would have advanced from the primary to the general election. See 460 F.3d 1108, 1114, n. 8 (C.A.9 2006).</p>\n<p>[6]  Our cases recognize a second type of facial challenge in the First Amendment context under which a law may be overturned as impermissibly overbroad because a \"substantial number\" of its applications are unconstitutional, \"`judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'\" <i>New York v. Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. 747, 769-771, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (quoting <i>Broadrick v. Oklahoma,</i> 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973)). We generally do not apply the \"`strong medicine'\" of overbreadth analysis where the parties fail to describe the instances of arguable overbreadth of the contested law. See <i>New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,</i> 487 U.S. 1, 14, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988).</p>\n<p>[7]  It is true that parties may no longer indicate their nominees on the ballot, but that is unexceptionable: The First Amendment does not give political parties a right to have their nominees designated as such on the ballot. See <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> 520 U.S. 351, 362-363, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997) (\"We are unpersuaded, however, by the party's contention that it has a right to use the ballot itself to send a particularized message, to its candidate and to the voters, about the nature of its support for the candidate\"). Parties do not gain such a right simply because the State affords candidates the opportunity to indicate their party preference on the ballot. \"Ballots serve primarily to elect candidates, not as forums for political expression.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 363, 117 S.Ct. 1364.</p>\n<p>[8]  Washington counties have broad authority to conduct elections entirely by mail ballot rather than at in-person polling places. See Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 29A.48.010. As a result, over 90% of Washington voters now vote by mail. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11.</p>\n<p>[9]  Respondents rely on <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,</i> 515 U.S. 557, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995) (holding that a State may not require a parade to include a group if the parade's organizer disagrees with the group's message), and <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> 530 U.S. 640, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000) (holding that the Boy Scouts' freedom of expressive association was violated by a state law requiring the organization to admit a homosexual scoutmaster). In those cases, <i>actual</i> association threatened to distort the groups' intended messages. We are aware of no case in which the mere <i>impression</i> of association was held to place a severe burden on a group's First Amendment rights, but we need not decide that question here.</p>\n<p>[10]  Relying on <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal.,</i> 475 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 903, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (holding that a state agency may not require a utility company to include a third-party newsletter in its billing envelope), respondents argue that the threat of voter confusion will force them to speak to clarify their positions. Because I-872 does not actually force the parties to speak, however, <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.</i> is inapposite. I-872 does not require the parties to reproduce another's speech against their will; nor does it co-opt the parties' own conduits for speech. Rather, it simply provides a place on the ballot for candidates to designate their party preferences. Facilitation of speech to which a political party may choose to respond does not amount to forcing the political party to speak. Cf. <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> 547 U.S. 47, 64-65, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006).</p>\n<p>[11]  Respondent Libertarian Party of Washington argues that I-872 is unconstitutional because of its implications for ballot access, trademark protection of party names, and campaign finance. We do not consider the ballot access and trademark arguments as they were not addressed below and are not encompassed by the question on which we granted certiorari: \"Does Washington's primary election system . . . violate the associational rights of political parties because candidates are permitted to identify their political party preference on the ballot?\" Pet. for cert. in No. 06-730, p. i.

Argued October 1, 2007\u2014Decided March 18, 2008*\nAfter the Ninth Circuit invalidated Washington\u2019s blanket primary sys-\n  tem on the ground that it was nearly identical to the California sys-\n  tem struck down in California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.

Respondent political par-\n  ties claim that the new law, on its face, violates a party\u2019s associa-\n  tional rights by usurping its right to nominate its own candidates and\n  by forcing it to associate with candidates it does not endorse.

Pp. 6\u20138.\n       (b) If I\u2013872 severely burdens associational rights, it is subject to\n    strict scrutiny and will be upheld only if it is \u201cnarrowly tailored to\n    serve a compelling state interest,\u201d Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U. S. 581,\n    586. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 argument, this Court\u2019s presumption in\n    Jones\u2014that a nonpartisan blanket primary where the top two\n    votegetters proceed to the general election regardless of party would\n    be a less restrictive alternative to California\u2019s system because it\n    would not nominate candidates\u2014is not dispositive here. There, the\n    Court had no occasion to determine whether a primary system that\n    indicates each candidate\u2019s party preference on the ballot, in effect,\n    chooses the parties\u2019 nominees. Respondents\u2019 arguments that I\u2013872\n    imposes a severe burden are flawed. They claim that the law is un-\n    constitutional under Jones because it allows primary voters unaffili-\n    ated with a party to choose the party\u2019s nominee, thus violating the\n    party\u2019s right to choose its own standard bearer. Unlike California\u2019s\n    primary, however, the I\u2013872 primary does not, by its terms, choose\n    the parties\u2019 nominees. The choice of a party representative does not\n    occur under I\u2013872. The two top primary candidates proceed to the\n    general election regardless of their party preferences. Whether the\n    parties nominate their own candidate outside the state-run primary\n    is irrelevant. Respondents counter that voters will assume that can-\n    didates on the general election ballot are their preferred nominees;\n    and that even if voters do not make that assumption, they will at\n    least assume that the parties associate with, and approve of, the\n    nominees. However, those claims depend not on any facial require-\n    ment of I\u2013872, but on the possibility that voters will be confused as to\n    the meaning of the party-preference designation. This is sheer specu-\n    lation. Even if voters could possibly misinterpret the designations, I\u2013\n    872 cannot be struck down in a facial challenge based on the mere\n    possibility of voter confusion. The State could implement I\u2013872 in a\n    variety of ways, e.g., through ballot design, that would eliminate any\n    real threat of confusion. And without the specter of widespread voter\n    confusion, respondents\u2019 forced association and compelled speech ar-\n    guments fall flat. Pp. 8\u201315.\n       (c) Because I\u2013872 does not severely burden respondents, the State\n    need not assert a compelling interest. Its interest in providing voters\n    with relevant information about the candidates on the ballot is easily\n    sufficient to sustain the provision.

The Court of Ap-\npeals for the Ninth Circuit held I\u2013872 facially invalid as\nimposing an unconstitutional burden on state political\nparties\u2019 First Amendment rights. Because I\u2013872 does not\non its face impose a severe burden on political parties\u2019\nassociational rights, and because respondents\u2019 arguments\nto the contrary rest on factual assumptions about voter\nconfusion that can be evaluated only in the context of an\n2      WASHINGTON STATE GRANGE v. WASHINGTON STATE\n                    REPUBLICAN PARTY                                     \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nas-applied challenge, we reverse.\n                              I\n   For most of the past century, Washington voters se-\nlected nominees for state and local offices using a blanket\nprimary.1 From 1935 until 2003, the State used a blanket\nprimary that placed candidates from all parties on one\nballot and allowed voters to select a candidate from any\nparty. See 1935 Wash. Laws, ch. \u00a7\u00a71\u20135, pp. 60\u201364. Under\nthis system, the candidate who won a plurality of votes\nwithin each major party became that party\u2019s nominee in\nthe general election. See 2003 Wash. Laws, \u00a7919, p. 775.\n   California used a nearly identical primary in its own\nelections until our decision in California Democratic Party\nv. Jones, 530 U. S. 567 (2000). In Jones, four political\nparties challenged California\u2019s blanket primary, arguing\nthat it unconstitutionally burdened their associational\nrights by forcing them to associate with voters who did not\nshare their beliefs. We agreed and struck down the blan-\nket primary as inconsistent with the First Amendment. In\nso doing, we emphasized the importance of the nomination\nprocess as \u201c \u2018the crucial juncture at which the appeal to\ncommon principles may be translated into concerted ac-\ntion, and hence to political power in the community.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 575 (quoting Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479\nU. S. 208, 216 (1986)). We observed that a party\u2019s right to\nexclude is central to its freedom of association, and is\nnever \u201cmore important than in the process of selecting its\nnominee.\u201d 530 U. S., at 575.

Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 576, n. 6 (2000). A\nblanket primary is distinct from an \u201copen primary,\u201d in which a person\nmay vote for any party\u2019s nominees, but must choose among that party\u2019s\nnominees for all offices, ibid., and the more traditional \u201cclosed primary\u201d\nin which \u201conly persons who are members of the political party . . . can\nvote on its nominee,\u201d id., at 570.\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe concluded, severely burdened the parties\u2019 freedom of\nassociation because it forced them to allow nonmembers to\nparticipate in selecting the parties\u2019 nominees. That the\nparties retained the right to endorse their preferred can-\ndidates did not render the burden any less severe, as\n\u201c[t]here is simply no substitute for a party\u2019s selecting its\nown candidates.\u201d Id., at 581.\n   Because California\u2019s blanket primary severely burdened\nthe parties\u2019 associational rights, we subjected it to strict\nscrutiny, carefully examining each of the state interests\noffered by California in support of its primary system. We\nrejected as illegitimate three of the asserted interests:\n\u201cproducing elected officials who better represent the elec-\ntorate,\u201d \u201cexpanding candidate debate beyond the scope of\npartisan concerns,\u201d and ensuring \u201cthe right to an effective\nvote\u201d by allowing nonmembers of a party to vote in the\nmajority party\u2019s primary in \u201c \u2018safe\u2019 \u201d districts. Id., at 582\u2013\n584.     We concluded that the remaining interests\u2014\npromoting fairness, affording voters greater choice, in-\ncreasing voter participation, and protecting privacy\u2014were\nnot compelling on the facts of the case. Even if they were,\nthe partisan California primary was not narrowly tailored\nto further those interests because a nonpartisan blanket\nprimary, in which the top two votegetters advance to the\ngeneral election regardless of party affiliation, would\naccomplish each of those interests without burdening the\nparties\u2019 associational rights. Id., at 585\u2013586. The nonpar-\ntisan blanket primary had \u201call the characteristics of the\npartisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial\none: Primary voters [were] not choosing a party\u2019s nomi-\nnee.\u201d Ibid.\n   After our decision in Jones, the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit struck down Washington\u2019s primary as \u201cma-\nterially indistinguishable from the California scheme.\u201d\nDemocratic Party of Washington State v.

The Washington State Grange2\npromptly proposed I\u2013872 as a replacement.3 It passed\nwith nearly 60% of the vote and became effective in De-\ncember 2004.\n  Under I\u2013872, all elections for \u201cpartisan offices\u201d4 are\nconducted in two stages: a primary and a general election.\nTo participate in the primary, a candidate must file a\n\u201cdeclaration of candidacy\u201d form, on which he declares his\n\u201cmajor or minor party preference, or independent status.\u201d\nWash. Rev. Code \u00a729A.24.030 (Supp. 2005). Each candi-\ndate and his party preference (or independent status) is in\nturn designated on the primary election ballot. A political\nparty cannot prevent a candidate who is unaffiliated with,\nor even repugnant to, the party from designating it as his\nparty of preference. See Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7434\u2013215\u2013\n015 (2005). In the primary election, voters may select\n\u201cany candidate listed on the ballot, regardless of the party\npreference of the candidates or the voter.\u201d \u00a7434\u2013262\u2013012.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The  Washington State Grange is a fraternal, social, and civic or-\nganization chartered by the National Grange in 1889. Although origi-\nnally formed to represent the interests of farmers, the organization has\nadvocated a variety of goals, including women\u2019s suffrage, rural electrifi-\ncation, protection of water resources, and universal telephone service.\nThe State Grange also supported the Washington constitutional\namendment establishing initiatives and referendums and sponsored\nthe 1934 blanket primary initiative.\n   3 Respondents make much of the fact that the promoters of I\u2013872\n\npresented it to Washington voters as a way to preserve the primary\nsystem in place from 1935 to 2003. But our task is not to judge I\u2013872\nbased on its promoters\u2019 assertions about its similarity, or lack thereof,\nto the unconstitutional primary; we must evaluate the constitutionality\nof I\u2013872 on its own terms. Whether the language of I\u2013872 was pur-\nposely drafted to survive a Jones-type constitutional challenge is\nirrelevant to whether it has successfully done so.\n   4 \u201c \u2018Partisan office\u2019 means a public office for which a candidate may\n\nindicate a political party preference on his or her declaration of candi-\ndacy and have that preference appear on the primary and general\nelection ballot in conjunction with his or her name.\u201d Wash.

Ibid. Thus, the general election\nmay pit two candidates with the same party preference\nagainst one another.5 Each candidate\u2019s party preference is\nlisted on the general election ballot, and may not be\nchanged between the primary and general elections. See\n\u00a7434\u2013230\u2013040.\n   Immediately after the State enacted regulations to\nimplement I\u2013872, the Washington State Republican Party\nfiled suit against a number of county auditors challenging\nthe law on its face. The party contended that the new\nsystem violates its associational rights by usurping its\nright to nominate its own candidates and by forcing it to\nassociate with candidates it does not endorse. The Wash-\nington State Democratic Central Committee and Libertar-\nian Party of Washington State joined the suit as plaintiffs.\nThe Washington State Grange joined as a defendant, and\nthe State of Washington was substituted for the county\nauditors as defendant. The United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Washington granted the politi-\ncal parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment and enjoined\nthe implementation of I\u2013872. See Washington State Re-\npublican Party v. Logan, 377 F. Supp. 2d 907, 932 (2005).\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 460 F. 3d 1108, 1125\n(CA9 2006). It held that the I\u2013872 primary severely bur-\ndens the political parties\u2019 associational rights because the\nparty-preference designation on the ballot creates a risk\nthat primary winners will be perceived as the parties\u2019\nnominees and produces an \u201cimpression of associatio[n]\u201d\nbetween a candidate and his party of preference even\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This is not a hypothetical outcome. The Court of Appeals observed\n\nthat, had the 1996 gubernatorial primary been conducted under the I\u2013\n872 system, two Democratic candidates and no Republican candidate\nwould have advanced from the primary to the general election.

The Court of Ap-\npeals noted a \u201cconstitutionally significant distinction\nbetween ballots and other vehicles for political expres-\nsion,\u201d reasoning that the risk of perceived association is\nparticularly acute when ballots include party labels be-\ncause such labels are typically used to designate candi-\ndates\u2019 views on issues of public concern. Id., at 1121. And\nit determined that the State\u2019s interests underlying I\u2013872\nwere not sufficiently compelling to justify the severe bur-\nden on the parties\u2019 association. Concluding that the provi-\nsions of I\u2013872 providing for the party-preference designa-\ntion on the ballot were not severable, the court struck\ndown I\u2013872 in its entirety.\n   We granted certiorari, 549 U.

The State has had no\nopportunity to implement I\u2013872, and its courts have had\nno occasion to construe the law in the context of actual\ndisputes arising from the electoral context, or to accord the\nlaw a limiting construction to avoid constitutional ques-\ntions.

That disagreement\nbegins with Jones. Petitioners argue that the I\u2013872 pri-\nmary is indistinguishable from the alternative Jones\nsuggested would be constitutional. In Jones we noted that\na nonpartisan blanket primary, where the top two vote-\ngetters proceed to the general election regardless of their\nparty, was a less restrictive alternative to California\u2019s\nsystem because such a primary does not nominate candi-\ndates. 530 U. S., at 585\u2013586 (The nonpartisan blanket\nprimary \u201chas all the characteristics of the partisan blanket\nprimary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary\nvoters are not choosing a party\u2019s nominee\u201d). Petitioners\nare correct that we assumed that the nonpartisan primary\nwe described in Jones would be constitutional. But that is\nnot dispositive here because we had no occasion in Jones\nto determine whether a primary system that indicates\neach candidate\u2019s party preference on the ballot, in effect,\nchooses the parties\u2019 nominees.\n10      WASHINGTON STATE GRANGE v. WASHINGTON STATE\n                     REPUBLICAN PARTY                                       \n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   That question is now squarely before us. Respondents\nargue that I\u2013872 is unconstitutional under Jones because\nit has the same \u201cconstitutionally crucial\u201d infirmity that\ndoomed California\u2019s blanket primary: it allows primary\nvoters who are unaffiliated with a party to choose the\nparty\u2019s nominee. Respondents claim that candidates who\nprogress to the general election under I\u2013872 will become\nthe de facto nominees of the parties they prefer, thereby\nviolating the parties\u2019 right to choose their own standard-\nbearers, see Timmons, supra, at 359, and altering their\nmessages. They rely on our statement in Jones reaffirm-\ning \u201cthe special place the First Amendment reserves for,\nand the special protection it accords, the process by which\na political party \u2018select[s] a standard bearer who best\nrepresents the party\u2019s ideologies and preferences.\u2019 \u201d Jones,\n550 U. S., at 575 (quoting Eu, supra, at 224).\n   The flaw in this argument is that, unlike the California\nprimary, the I\u2013872 primary does not, by its terms, choose\nparties\u2019 nominees. The essence of nomination\u2014the choice\nof a party representative\u2014does not occur under I\u2013872.\nThe law never refers to the candidates as nominees of any\nparty, nor does it treat them as such. To the contrary, the\nelection regulations specifically provide that the primary\n\u201cdoes not serve to determine the nominees of a political\nparty but serves to winnow the number of candidates to a\nfinal list of two for the general election.\u201d Wash. Admin.\nCode \u00a7434\u2013262\u2013012. The top two candidates from the\nprimary election proceed to the general election regardless\nof their party preferences. Whether parties nominate\ntheir own candidates outside the state-run primary is\nsimply irrelevant. In fact, parties may now nominate\ncandidates by whatever mechanism they choose because\nI\u2013872 repealed Washington\u2019s prior regulations governing\nparty nominations.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 It   is true that parties may no longer indicate their nominees on the\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Respondents counter that, even if the I\u2013872 primary\ndoes not actually choose parties\u2019 nominees, it nevertheless\nburdens their associational rights because voters will\nassume that candidates on the general election ballot are\nthe nominees of their preferred parties. This brings us to\nthe heart of respondents\u2019 case\u2014and to the fatal flaw in\ntheir argument. At bottom, respondents\u2019 objection to I\u2013\n872 is that voters will be confused by candidates\u2019 party-\npreference designations. Respondents\u2019 arguments are\nlargely variations on this theme. Thus, they argue that\neven if voters do not assume that candidates on the gen-\neral election ballot are the nominees of their parties, they\nwill at least assume that the parties associate with, and\napprove of, them. This, they say, compels them to associ-\nate with candidates they do not endorse, alters the mes-\nsages they wish to convey, and forces them to engage in\ncounterspeech to disassociate themselves from the candi-\ndates and their positions on the issues.\n  We reject each of these contentions for the same reason:\nThey all depend, not on any facial requirement of I\u2013872,\nbut on the possibility that voters will be confused as to the\nmeaning of the party-preference designation. But respon-\ndents\u2019 assertion that voters will misinterpret the party-\npreference designation is sheer speculation. It \u201cdepends\nupon the belief that voters can be \u2018misled\u2019 by party labels.\nBut \u2018[o]ur cases reflect a greater faith in the ability of\nindividual voters to inform themselves about campaign\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nballot, but that is unexceptionable: The First Amendment does not give\npolitical parties a right to have their nominees designated as such on\nthe ballot. See Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351,\n362\u2013363 (1997) (\u201cWe are unpersuaded, however, by the party\u2019s conten-\ntion that it has a right to use the ballot itself to send a particularized\nmessage, to its candidate and to the voters, about the nature of its\nsupport for the candidate\u201d). Parties do not gain such a right simply\nbecause the State affords candidates the opportunity to indicate their\nparty preference on the ballot. \u201cBallots serve primarily to elect candi-\ndates, not as forums for political expression.\u201d Id., at 363.\n12   WASHINGTON STATE GRANGE v.

S., at 220 (quoting Anderson,\n460 U. S., at 797). There is simply no basis to presume\nthat a well-informed electorate will interpret a candidate\u2019s\nparty-preference designation to mean that the candidate is\nthe party\u2019s chosen nominee or representative or that the\nparty associates with or approves of the candidate. See\nNew York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York, 487\nU. S. 1, 13\u201314 (1988) (rejecting a facial challenge to a law\nregulating club membership and noting that \u201c[w]e could\nhardly hold otherwise on the record before us, which con-\ntains no specific evidence on the characteristics of any club\ncovered by the [l]aw\u201d). This strikes us as especially true\nhere, given that it was the voters of Washington them-\nselves, rather than their elected representatives, who\nenacted I\u2013872.\n   Of course, it is possible that voters will misinterpret the\ncandidates\u2019 party-preference designations as reflecting\nendorsement by the parties. But these cases involve a\nfacial challenge, and we cannot strike down I\u2013872 on its\nface based on the mere possibility of voter confusion. See\nYazoo, 226 U. S., at 219 (\u201c[T]his court must deal with the\ncase in hand and not with imaginary ones\u201d); Pullman Co.\nv. Knott, 235 U. S. 23, 26 (1914) (A statute \u201cis not to be\nupset upon hypothetical and unreal possibilities, if it\nwould be good upon the facts as they are\u201d). Because re-\nspondents brought their suit as a facial challenge, we have\nno evidentiary record against which to assess their asser-\ntions that voters will be confused. See Timmons, 520\nU.

It stands to reason that whether voters will\nbe confused by the party-preference designations will\ndepend in significant part on the form of the ballot. The\n                   Cite as: 552 U.

It thought that even\nsuch a clear statement did too little to eliminate the risk of\nvoter confusion.\n  But we see no reason to stop there. As long as we are\nspeculating about the form of the ballot\u2014and we can do no\nmore than speculate in this facial challenge\u2014we must, in\nfairness to the voters of the State of Washington who\nenacted I\u2013872 and in deference to the executive and judi-\ncial officials who are charged with implementing it, ask\nwhether the ballot could conceivably be printed in such a\nway as to eliminate the possibility of widespread voter\nconfusion and with it the perceived threat to the First\nAmendment. See Ayotte, 546 U.

In those cases,\nactual association threatened to distort the groups\u2019 intended messages.\nWe are aware of no case in which the mere impression of association\nwas held to place a severe burden on a group\u2019s First Amendment rights,\nbut we need not decide that question here.\n   10 Relying on Pacific Gas & Elec.

I\u2013872\ndoes not require the parties to reproduce another\u2019s speech against their\nwill; nor does it co-opt the parties\u2019 own conduits for speech. Rather, it\nsimply provides a place on the ballot for candidates to designate their\nparty preferences. Facilitation of speech to which a political party may\nchoose to respond does not amount to forcing the political party to\nspeak. Cf. Rumsfeld v.

On its\nface, I\u2013872 does not impose any severe burden on respon-\ndents\u2019 associational rights.\n                               B\n   Because we have concluded that I\u2013872 does not severely\nburden respondents, the State need not assert a compel-\nling interest. See Clingman, 544 U.

Our other forced-association cases\nindicate as much. In Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530\nU. S. 640, 653 (2000), we said that Dale\u2019s presence in the\nBoy Scouts would \u201cforce the organization to send a mes-\nsage . . . [to] the world\u201d that the Scouts approved of homo-\nsexuality. In other words, accepting Dale would lead\noutsiders to believe the Scouts endorsed homosexual\nconduct. Largely for that reason, we held that the First\n2   WASHINGTON STATE GRANGE v. WASHINGTON STATE\n                 REPUBLICAN PARTY                             \n\n                ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\n\n\nAmendment entitled the Scouts to exclude Dale. Id., at\n659. Similarly, in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian\nand Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 (1995),\nwe allowed the organizers of Boston\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day\nParade to exclude a pro-gay rights float because the float\u2019s\npresence in the parade might create the impression that\nthe organizers agreed with the float-sponsors\u2019 message.\nSee id., at 575\u2013577.\n   Voter perceptions matter, and if voters do not actually\nbelieve the parties and the candidates are tied together, it\nis hard to see how the parties\u2019 associational rights are\nadversely implicated. See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Aca-\ndemic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 65\n(2006) (rejecting law schools\u2019 First Amendment objection\nto military recruiters on campus because no reasonable\nperson would believe the \u201claw schools agree[d] with any\nspeech by recruiters\u201d). After all, individuals frequently\nclaim to favor this or that political party; these prefer-\nences, without more, do not create an unconstitutional\nforced association.\n   What makes these cases different, as JUSTICE SCALIA\nexplains, is the place where the candidates express their\nparty preferences: on the ballot. See post, at 4 (dissenting\nopinion) (noting \u201cthe special role that a state-printed\nballot plays in elections\u201d). And what makes the ballot\n\u201cspecial\u201d is precisely the effect it has on voter impressions.\nSee Cook v. Gralike, 531 U. S. 510, 532 (2001) (Rehnquist,\nC.

Petitioners themselves emphasize\nthat the content of the ballots in the pertinent respect is\nyet to be determined. See Reply Brief for Washington\nState Grange 2\u20134, 7\u201313.\n   If the ballot is designed in such a manner that no rea-\nsonable voter would believe that the candidates listed\nthere are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated\nwith, the parties the candidates claimed to \u201cprefer,\u201d the\nI\u2013872 primary system would likely pass constitutional\nmuster. I cannot say on the present record that it would\nbe impossible for the State to design such a ballot. Assum-\ning the ballot is so designed, voters would not regard the\nlisted candidates as \u201cparty\u201d candidates, any more than\nsomeone saying \u201cI like Campbell\u2019s soup\u201d would be under-\nstood to be associated with Campbell\u2019s. Voters would\nunderstand that the candidate does not speak on the\nparty\u2019s behalf or with the party\u2019s approval. On the other\nhand, if the ballot merely lists the candidates\u2019 preferred\nparties next to the candidates\u2019 names, or otherwise fails\nclearly to convey that the parties and the candidates are\nnot necessarily associated, the I\u2013872 system would not\nsurvive a First Amendment challenge.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA complains that \u201c[i]t is hard to know how\nto respond\u201d to such mistaken views, post, at 6 (dissenting\nopinion), but he soldiers on nonetheless. He would hold\nthat a party is burdened by a candidate\u2019s statement of\npreference even if no reasonable voter believes from the\nballot that the party and the candidate are associated. I\ntake his point to be that a particular candidate\u2019s \u201cen-\ndorsement\u201d of a party might alter the party\u2019s message, and\nthis violates the party\u2019s freedom of association. See post,\nat 7 (dissenting opinion).\n   But there is no general right to stop an individual from\nsaying, \u201cI prefer this party,\u201d even if the party would rather\nhe not. Normally, the party protects its message in such a\ncase through responsive speech of its own. What makes\n4   WASHINGTON STATE GRANGE v.

J., concurring\n\n\nthis case different of course is that the State controls the\ncontent of the ballot, which we have never considered a\npublic forum. See Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New\nParty, 520 U. S. 351, 363 (1997) (ballots are not \u201cforums\nfor political expression\u201d). Neither the candidate nor the\nparty dictates the message conveyed by the ballot. In such\na case, it is important to know what the ballot actually\nsays\u2014both about the candidate and about the party\u2019s\nassociation with the candidate. It is possible that no\nreasonable voter in Washington State will regard the\nlisted candidates as members of, or otherwise associated\nwith, the political parties the candidates claim to prefer.\nNothing in my analysis requires the parties to produce\nstudies regarding voter perceptions on this score, but I\nwould wait to see what the ballot says before deciding\nwhether it is unconstitutional.\n   Still, I agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that the history of the\nchallenged law suggests the State is not particularly\ninterested in devising ballots that meet these constitu-\ntional requirements. See post, at 7\u20138 (dissenting opinion).\nBut this record simply does not allow us to say with cer-\ntainty that the election system created by I\u2013872 is uncon-\nstitutional. Accordingly, I agree with the Court that\nrespondents\u2019 present challenge to the law must fail, and I\njoin the Court\u2019s opinion.\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

When the state-\nprinted ballot for the general election causes a party to be\nassociated with candidates who may not fully (if at all)\nrepresent its views, it undermines both these vital aspects\nof political association. The views of the self-identified\nparty supporter color perception of the party\u2019s message,\nand that self-identification on the ballot, with no space for\nparty repudiation or party identification of its own candi-\ndate, impairs the party\u2019s advocacy of its standard bearer.\nBecause Washington has not demonstrated that this\nsevere burden upon parties\u2019 associational rights is nar-\nrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest\u2014indeed,\nbecause it seems to me Washington\u2019s only plausible inter-\n2   WASHINGTON STATE GRANGE v.

States may not use election regulations to undercut\npolitical parties\u2019 freedoms of speech or association. See\nU. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 833\u2013\n834 (1995). Thus, when a State regulates political parties\nas a part of its election process, we consider \u201cthe \u2018character\nand magnitude\u2019 \u201d of the burden imposed on the party\u2019s\nassociational rights and \u201cthe extent to which the State\u2019s\nconcerns make the burden necessary.\u201d Timmons v. Twin\nCities Area New Party, 520 U. S. 351, 358 (1997). Regula-\ntions imposing severe burdens must be narrowly tailored\nto advance a compelling state interest. Ibid.\n   Among the First Amendment rights that political par-\nties possess is the right to associate with the persons\nwhom they choose and to refrain from associating with\npersons whom they reject. Democratic Party of United\nStates v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 122\n(1981). Also included is the freedom to choose and pro-\nmote the \u201c \u2018standard bearer who best represents the\nparty\u2019s ideologies and preferences.\u2019 \u201d Eu v. San Francisco\nCounty Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.

We therefore\nheld, for example, that a State severely burdened the right\nof expressive association when it required the Boy Scouts\nto accept an openly gay scoutmaster. The scoutmaster\u2019s\npresence \u201cwould, at the very least, force the organization\nto send a message, both to the youth members and the\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

S. 640, 653 (2000).\n   A political party\u2019s expressive mission is not simply, or\neven primarily, to persuade voters of the party\u2019s views.\nParties seek principally to promote the election of candi-\ndates who will implement those views. See, e.g., Tashjian\nv. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 216 (1986);\nStorer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 745 (1974); M. Hershey &\nP. Beck, Party Politics in America 13 (10th ed. 2003).\nThat is achieved in large part by marking candidates with\nthe party\u2019s seal of approval. Parties devote substantial\nresources to making their names trusted symbols of cer-\ntain approaches to governance. See, e.g., App. 239 (Decla-\nration of Democratic Committee Chair Paul J. Berendt); J.\nAldrich, Why Parties? 48\u201349 (1995). They then encourage\nvoters to cast their votes for the candidates that carry the\nparty name. Parties\u2019 efforts to support candidates by\nmarking them with the party trademark, so to speak, have\nbeen successful enough to make the party name, in the\nwords of one commentator, \u201cthe most important resource\nthat the party possesses.\u201d Cain, Party Autonomy and\nTwo-Party Electoral Competition, 149 U. Pa. L. Rev. 793,\n804 (2001). And all evidence suggests party labels are\nindeed a central consideration for most voters. See, e.g.,\nid., at 804, n. 34; Rahn, The Role of Partisan Stereotypes\nin Information Processing About Political Candidates, 37\nAm. J. Pol.

See California Democratic\nParty v. Jones, 530 U. S. 567, 585\u2013586 (2000). Parties\nwould then be left to their own devices in both selecting\nand publicizing their candidates. But Washington has\ndone more than merely decline to make its electoral ma-\nchinery available for party building. Recognizing that\nparties draw support for their candidates by giving them\nthe party imprimatur, Washington seeks to reduce the\neffectiveness of that endorsement by allowing any candi-\ndate to use the ballot for drawing upon the goodwill that a\nparty has developed, while preventing the party from\nusing the ballot to reject the claimed association or to\nidentify the genuine candidate of its choice. This does not\nmerely place the ballot off limits for party building; it\nmakes the ballot an instrument by which party building is\nimpeded, permitting unrebutted associations that the\nparty itself does not approve.\n   These cases cannot be decided without taking account of\nthe special role that a state-printed ballot plays in elec-\ntions. The ballot comes into play \u201cat the most crucial\nstage in the electoral process\u2014the instant before the vote\nis cast.\u201d Anderson v. Martin, 375 U. S. 399, 402 (1964).

Forced asso-\nciation with the party on the general election ballot was\nfatal. Id., at 575\u2013577.\n   The Court makes much of the fact that the party names\nshown on the Washington ballot may be billed as mere\nstatements of candidate \u201cpreference.\u201d See ante, at 11\u201314.\nTo be sure, the party is not itself forced to display favor for\nsomeone it does not wish to associate with, as the Boy\nScouts were arguably forced to do by employing the homo-\nsexual scoutmaster in Dale, and as the political parties\nwere arguably forced to do by lending their ballot-\nendorsement as party nominee in Jones. But thrusting an\nunwelcome, self-proclaimed association upon the party on\nthe election ballot itself is amply destructive of the party\u2019s\nassociational rights. An individual\u2019s endorsement of a\nparty shapes the voter\u2019s view of what the party stands for,\nno less than the party\u2019s endorsement of an individual\nshapes the voter\u2019s view of what the individual stands for.\nThat is why party nominees are often asked (and regularly\nagree) to repudiate the support of persons regarded as\nracial extremists. On Washington\u2019s ballot, such repudia-\ntion is impossible. And because the ballot is the only\ndocument voters are guaranteed to see, and the last thing\nthey see before casting their vote, there is \u201cno means\nof replying\u201d that \u201cwould be equally effective with the\nvoter.\u201d Cook, supra, at 532 (Rehnquist, C.

There can be no dispute that candidate\nacquisition of party labels on Washington\u2019s ballot\u2014even if\nbilled as self-identification\u2014is a means of garnering the\nsupport of those who trust and agree with the party.

These harms\nwill be present no matter how Washington\u2019s law is imple-\nmented. There is therefore \u201cno set of circumstances\u201d\nunder which Washington\u2019s law would not severely burden\npolitical parties, see United States v. Salerno, 481 U.

He has associated himself with the party by\nhis very expression of a preference\u2014and that indeed is the\nwhole purpose of allowing the preference to be expressed.\nIf all THE CHIEF JUSTICE means by \u201cassociated with\u201d is\nthat the candidate \u201cdoes not speak on the party\u2019s behalf or\nwith the party\u2019s approval,\u201d ibid., none of my analysis in\nthis opinion relies upon that misperception, nor upon the\nmisperception that the candidate is a member or the\nnominee of the party. Avoiding those misperceptions is far\nfrom enough. Is it enough to say on the ballot that a\nnotorious and despised racist who says that the party is\nhis choice does not speak with the party\u2019s approval?\nSurely not. His unrebutted association of that party with\nhis views distorts the image of the party nonetheless. And\nthe fact that the candidate who expresses a \u201cpreference\u201d\nfor one or another party is shown not to be the nominee of\nthat party does not deprive him of the boost from the\nparty\u2019s reputation which the party wishes to confer only\non its nominee. THE CHIEF JUSTICE claims that \u201cthe\ncontent of the ballots in the pertinent respect is yet to be\ndetermined,\u201d ibid. I disagree. We know all we need to\nknow about the form of ballot. When pressed, Washing-\nton\u2019s Attorney General assured us at oral argument that\nthe ballot will not say whether the party for whom the\ncandidate expresses a preference claims or disavows him.\n(Of course it will not, for that would enable the party\nexpression that it is the very object of this legislation to\nimpair.)\n   And finally, while THE CHIEF JUSTICE earlier expresses\nhis awareness that the special character of the ballot is\nwhat makes these cases different, ante, at 2, his Camp-\nbell\u2019s Soup example seems to forget that. If we must\n8   WASHINGTON STATE GRANGE v. WASHINGTON STATE\n                 REPUBLICAN PARTY                            \n\n                  SCALIA, J., dissenting \n\n\nspeak in terms of soup, Washington\u2019s law is like a law that\nencourages Oscar the Grouch (Sesame Street\u2019s famed bad-\ntaste resident of a garbage can) to state a \u201cpreference\u201d for\nCampbell\u2019s at every point of sale, while barring the soup\ncompany from disavowing his endorsement, or indeed\nusing its name at all, in those same crucial locations.\nReserving the most critical communications forum for\nstatements of \u201cpreference\u201d by a potentially distasteful\nspeaker alters public perceptions of the entity that is\n\u201cpreferred\u201d; and when this privileged connection under-\nmines not a company\u2019s ability to identify and promote\nsoup but an expressive association\u2019s ability to identify\nand promote its message and its standard bearer, the\nState treads on the constitutionally protected freedom of\nassociation.\n  The majority opinion and THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s concur-\nrence also endorse a wait-and-see approach on the grounds\nthat it is not yet evident how the law will affect voter\nperception of the political parties. But contrary to the\nCourt\u2019s suggestion, it is not incumbent on the political\nparties to adduce \u201cevidence,\u201d ante, at 15, that forced asso-\nciation affects their ability to advocate for their candidates\nand their causes. We have never put expressive groups to\nthis perhaps-impossible task. Rather, we accept their own\nassessments of the matter. The very cases on which THE\nCHIEF JUSTICE relies for a wait-and-see approach, ante, at\n1\u20132, establish as much. In Dale, for example, we did not\nrequire the Boy Scouts to prove that forced acceptance of\nthe openly homosexual scoutmaster would distort their\nmessage. See 530 U. S., at 653 (citing La Follette, 450\nU. S., at 123\u2013124). Nor in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay,\nLesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.

It does not take a study to\nestablish that when statements of party connection are\nthe sole information listed next to candidate names on the\nballot, those statements will affect voters\u2019 perceptions of\nwhat the candidate stands for, what the party stands for,\nand whom they should elect.\n                              III\n   Since I conclude that Washington\u2019s law imposes a severe\nburden on political parties\u2019 associational rights, I would\nuphold the law only if it were \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to ad-\nvance \u201ca compelling state interest.\u201d Timmons, 520 U. S.,\nat 358. Neither the Court\u2019s opinion nor the State\u2019s sub-\nmission claims that Washington\u2019s law passes such scru-\ntiny. The State argues only that it \u201chas a rational basis\u201d\nfor \u201cproviding voters with a modicum of relevant informa-\ntion about the candidates,\u201d Brief for Petitioners in No. 06\u2013\n730, pp. 48\u201349. This is the only interest the Court\u2019s opin-\nion identifies as well. Ante, at 15.\n   But \u201crational basis\u201d is the least demanding of our tests;\nit is the same test that allows individuals to be taxed at\ndifferent rates because they are in different businesses.\nSee Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522,\n526\u2013527 (1959). It falls far, far short of establishing the\ncompelling state interest that the First Amendment re-\nquires. And to tell the truth, here even the existence of a\nrational basis is questionable. Allowing candidates to\nidentify themselves with particular parties on the ballot\ndisplays the State\u2019s view that adherence to party philoso-\nphy is \u201can important\u2014perhaps paramount\u2014consideration\nin the citizen\u2019s choice.\u201d Anderson, 375 U.

There is no state\ninterest behind this law except the Washington Legisla-\nture\u2019s dislike for bright-colors partisanship, and its desire\nto blunt the ability of political parties with noncentrist\nviews to endorse and advocate their own candidates. That\nwas the purpose of the Washington system that this en-\nactment was adopted to replace\u2014a system indistinguish-\nable from the one we invalidated in Jones, which required\nparties to allow nonmembers to join in the selection of the\ncandidates shown as their nominees on the election ballot.\n(The system was held unconstitutional in Democratic\nParty of Washington State v. Reed, 343 F. 3d 1198 (CA9\n2003).) And it is the obvious purpose of Washington legis-\nlation enacted after this law, which requires political\nparties to repeat a candidate\u2019s self-declared party \u201cprefer-\nence\u201d in electioneering communications concerning the\ncandidate\u2014even if the purpose of the communication\nis to criticize the candidate and to disavow any con-\nnection between him and the party.

Code \u00a7390\u2013\n18\u2013020 (2007).\n  Even if I were to assume, however, that Washington has\na legitimate interest in telling voters on the ballot (above\nall other things) that a candidate says he favors a particu-\nlar political party; and even if I were further to assume\n(per impossibile) that that interest was a compelling one;\nWashington would still have to \u201cnarrowly tailor\u201d its law to\nprotect that interest with minimal intrusion upon the\nparties\u2019 associational rights. There has been no attempt to\ndo that here. Washington could, for example, have per-\nmitted parties to disclaim on the general-election ballot\nthe asserted association or to designate on the ballot their\ntrue nominees.

Washington\u2019s electoral system\npermits individuals to appropriate the parties\u2019 trade-\nmarks, so to speak, at the most crucial stage of election,\nthereby distorting the parties\u2019 messages and impairing\ntheir endorsement of candidates. The State\u2019s justification\nfor this (to convey a \u201cmodicum of relevant information\u201d) is\nnot only weak but undeserving of credence. We have here\na system which, like the one it replaced, does not merely\nrefuse to assist, but positively impairs, the legitimate role\nof political parties.

Segal, Jay Carlson, Alex Wagner, Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart, Preston Gates Ellis LLP, Seattle, WA, for Respondent Washington State Democratic Central Committee.</p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In 2004, voters in the State of Washington passed an initiative changing the State's primary election system. The People's Choice Initiative of 2004, or Initiative 872 (I-872), provides that candidates for office shall be identified on the ballot by their self-designated \"party preference\"; that voters may vote for any candidate; and that the top two votegetters for each office, regardless of party preference, advance to the general election. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held I-872 facially invalid as imposing an unconstitutional burden on state political parties' First Amendment rights. Because I-872 does not on its face impose a severe burden on political parties' associational rights, and because respondents' arguments to the contrary rest on factual assumptions about voter confusion that can be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>For most of the past century, Washington voters selected nominees for state and local offices using a blanket primary.<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1188</span> From 1935 until 2003, the State used a blanket primary that placed candidates from all parties on one ballot and allowed voters to select a candidate from any party. See 1935 Wash. Laws, ch. \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, pp. 60-64. Under this system, the candidate who won a plurality of votes within each major party became that party's nominee in the general election. See 2003 Wash. Laws, \u00a7 919, p. 775.</p>\n<p>California used a nearly identical primary in its own elections until our decision in <i>California Democratic Party v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118382\"><a href=\"/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000). In <i>Jones,</i> four political parties challenged California's blanket primary, arguing that it unconstitutionally burdened their associational rights by forcing them to associate with voters who did not share their beliefs. We agreed and struck down the blanket primary as inconsistent with the First Amendment. In so doing, we emphasized the importance of the nomination process as \"`the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be translated into concerted action, and hence to political power in the community.' \" <i>Id.,</i> at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (quoting <i>Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111781\"><a href=\"/opinion/111781/tashjian-v-republican-party-of-conn/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></a></span>, 216, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986)). We observed that a party's right to exclude is central to its freedom of association, and is never \"more important than in the process of selecting its nominee.\" 530 U.S., at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402. California's blanket primary, we concluded, severely burdened the parties' freedom of association because it forced them to allow nonmembers to participate in selecting the parties' nominees. That the parties retained the right to endorse their preferred candidates did not render the burden any less severe, as \"[t]here is simply no substitute for a party's selecting its own candidates.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 581, 120 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n<p>Because California's blanket primary severely burdened the parties' associational rights, we subjected it to strict scrutiny, carefully examining each of the state interests offered by California in support of its primary system. We rejected as illegitimate three of the asserted interests: \"producing elected officials who better represent the electorate,\" \"expanding candidate debate beyond the scope of partisan concerns,\" and ensuring \"the right to an effective vote\" by allowing nonmembers of a party to vote in the majority party's primary in \"`safe'\" districts. <i>Id.,</i> at 582-584, 120 S.Ct. 2402. We concluded that the remaining interests\u0097promoting fairness, affording voters greater choice, increasing voter participation, and protecting privacy\u0097were not compelling on the facts of the case. Even if they were, the partisan California primary was not narrowly tailored to further those interests because a nonpartisan blanket primary, in which the top two votegetters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation, would accomplish each of those interests without burdening the parties' associational rights. <i>Id.,</i> at 585-586, 120 S.Ct. 2402. The nonpartisan blanket primary had \"all the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters [were] not choosing a party's nominee.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>After our decision in <i>Jones,</i> the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1189</span> Washington's primary as \"materially indistinguishable from the California scheme.\" <i>Democratic Party of Washington State v. Reed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783589\"><a href=\"/opinion/783589/democratic-party-of-washington-state-paul-berendt-/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span>, 1203 (2003). The Washington State Grange<sup>[2]</sup> promptly proposed I-872 as a replacement.<sup>[3]</sup> It passed with nearly 60% of the vote and became effective in December 2004.</p>\n<p>Under I-872, all elections for \"partisan offices\"<sup>[4]</sup> are conducted in two stages: a primary and a general election. To participate in the primary, a candidate must file a \"declaration of candidacy\" form, on which he declares his \"major or minor party preference, or independent status.\" Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 29A.24.030 (Supp.2005). Each candidate and his party preference (or independent status) is in turn designated on the primary election ballot. A political party cannot prevent a candidate who is unaffiliated with, or even repugnant to, the party from designating it as his party of preference. See Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 434-215-015 (2005). In the primary election, voters may select \"any candidate listed on the ballot, regardless of the party preference of the candidates or the voter.\" \u00a7 434-262-012.</p>\n<p>The candidates with the highest and second-highest vote totals advance to the general election, regardless of their party preferences. <i>Ibid.</i> Thus, the general election may pit two candidates with the same party preference against one another.<sup>[5]</sup> Each candidate's party preference is listed on the general election ballot, and may not be changed between the primary and general elections. See \u00a7 434-230-040.</p>\n<p>Immediately after the State enacted regulations to implement I-872, the Washington State Republican Party filed suit against a number of county auditors challenging the law on its face. The party contended that the new system violates its associational rights by usurping its right to nominate its own candidates and by forcing it to associate with candidates it does not endorse. The Washington State Democratic Central Committee and Libertarian Party of Washington State joined the suit as plaintiffs. The Washington State Grange joined as a defendant, and the State of Washington was substituted for the county auditors as defendant. The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington granted the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1190</span> political parties' motions for summary judgment and enjoined the implementation of I-872. See <i>Washington State Republican Party v. Logan,</i> 377 F.Supp.2d 907, 932 (2005).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795488\"><a href=\"/opinion/795488/washington-state-republican-party-diane-tebelius-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></a></span>, 1125 (C.A.9 2006). It held that the I-872 primary severely burdens the political parties' associational rights because the party-preference designation on the ballot creates a risk that primary winners will be perceived as the parties' nominees and produces an \"impression of associatio[n]\" between a candidate and his party of preference even when the party does not associate, or wish to be associated, with the candidate. <i>Id.,</i> at 1119. The Court of Appeals noted a \"constitutionally significant distinction between ballots and other vehicles for political expression,\" reasoning that the risk of perceived association is particularly acute when ballots include party labels because such labels are typically used to designate candidates' views on issues of public concern. <i>Id.,</i> at 1121. And it determined that the State's interests underlying I-872 were not sufficiently compelling to justify the severe burden on the parties' association. Concluding that the provisions of I-872 providing for the party-preference designation on the ballot were not severable, the court struck down I-872 in its entirety.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1373, 167 L.Ed.2d 158 (2007), to determine whether I-872, on its face, violates the political parties' associational rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Respondents object to I-872 not in the context of an actual election, but in a facial challenge. Under <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987), a plaintiff can only succeed in a facial challenge by \"establish[ing] that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid,\" <i>i.e.,</i> that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications. <i>Id.,</i> at 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095. While some Members of the Court have criticized the <i>Salerno</i> formulation, all agree that a facial challenge must fail where the statute has a \"`plainly legitimate sweep.'\" <i>Washington v. Glucksberg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 739-740, and n. 7, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgments). Washington's primary system survives under either standard, as we explain below.<sup>[6]</sup> In determining whether a law is facially invalid, we must be careful not to go beyond the statute's facial requirements and speculate about \"hypothetical\" or \"imaginary\" cases. See <i>United States v. Raines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106008\"><a href=\"/opinion/106008/united-states-v-james-griggs-raines/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 22, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960) (\"The delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined\"). The State has had no opportunity to implement I-872, and its courts have had no occasion to construe the law in the context of actual disputes arising from the electoral context, or to accord the law a limiting construction to avoid constitutional questions. Cf. <i>Yazoo</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1191</span> <i>&amp; Mississippi Valley R. Co. v.

Exercising judicial restraint in a facial challenge \"frees the Court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.\" <i>Raines, supra,</i> at 22, 80 S.Ct. 519.</p>\n<p>Facial challenges are disfavored for several reasons. Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation. As a consequence, they raise the risk of \"premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\" <i>Sabri v.

Facial challenges also run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither \"`anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it'\" nor \"`formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.'\" <i>Ashwander v.

That disagreement begins with <i>Jones.</i> Petitioners argue that the I-872 primary is indistinguishable from the alternative <i>Jones</i> suggested would be constitutional. In <i>Jones</i> we noted that a nonpartisan blanket primary, where the top two votegetters proceed to the general election regardless of their party, was a less restrictive alternative to California's system because such a primary does not nominate candidates. 530 U.S., at 585-586, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (The nonpartisan blanket primary \"has all the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a party's nominee\"). Petitioners are correct that we assumed that the nonpartisan primary we described in <i>Jones</i> would be constitutional. But that is not dispositive here because we had no occasion in <i>Jones</i> to determine whether a primary system that indicates each candidate's party preference on the ballot, in effect, chooses the parties' nominees.</p>\n<p>That question is now squarely before us. Respondents argue that I-872 is unconstitutional under <i>Jones</i> because it has the same \"constitutionally crucial\" infirmity that doomed California's blanket primary: it allows primary voters who are unaffiliated with a party to choose the party's nominee. Respondents claim that candidates who progress to the general election under I-872 will become the <i>de facto</i> nominees of the parties they prefer, thereby violating the parties' right to choose their own standard-bearers, see <i>Timmons, supra,</i> at 359, 117 S.Ct. 1364, and altering their messages. They rely on our statement in <i>Jones</i> reaffirming \"the special place the First Amendment reserves for, and the special protection it accords, the process by which a political party `select[s] a standard bearer who best represents the party's ideologies and preferences.'\" <i>Jones,</i> 530 U.S., at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (quoting <i>Eu, supra,</i> at 224, 109 S.Ct. 1013).</p>\n<p>The flaw in this argument is that, unlike the California primary, the I-872 primary does not, by its terms, choose parties' nominees. The essence of nomination\u0097the choice of a party representative\u0097does not occur under I-872. The law never refers to the candidates as nominees of any party, nor does it treat them as such. To the contrary, the election regulations specifically provide that the primary \"does not serve to determine the nominees of a political party but serves to winnow the number of candidates to a final list of two for the general election.\" Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 434-262-012. The top two candidates from the primary election proceed to the general election regardless of their party preferences. Whether parties nominate their own candidates outside the state-run primary is simply irrelevant. In fact, parties may now nominate candidates by whatever mechanism they choose because <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1193</span> I-872 repealed Washington's prior regulations governing party nominations.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>Respondents counter that, even if the I-872 primary does not actually choose parties' nominees, it nevertheless burdens their associational rights because voters will assume that candidates on the general election ballot are the nominees of their preferred parties. This brings us to the heart of respondents' case\u0097and to the fatal flaw in their argument. At bottom, respondents' objection to I-872 is that voters will be confused by candidates' partypreference designations. Respondents' arguments are largely variations on this theme. Thus, they argue that even if voters do not assume that candidates on the general election ballot are the nominees of their parties, they will at least assume that the parties associate with, and approve of, them. This, they say, compels them to associate with candidates they do not endorse, alters the messages they wish to convey, and forces them to engage in counterspeech to disassociate themselves from the candidates and their positions on the issues.</p>\n<p>We reject each of these contentions for the same reason: They all depend, not on any facial requirement of I-872, but on the possibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning of the party-preference designation. But respondents' assertion that voters will misinterpret the partypreference designation is sheer speculation. It \"depends upon the belief that voters can be `misled' by party labels. But `[o]ur cases reflect a greater faith in the ability of individual voters to inform themselves about campaign issues.'\" <i>Tashjian,</i> 479 U.S., at 220, 107 S.Ct. 544 (quoting <i>Anderson,</i> 460 U.S., at 797, 103 S.Ct. 1564). There is simply no basis to presume that a well-informed electorate will interpret a candidate's party-preference designation to mean that the candidate is the party's chosen nominee or representative or that the party associates with or approves of the candidate. See <i>New York State Club Assn., Inc. v. City of New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112114\"><a href=\"/opinion/112114/new-york-state-club-assn-inc-v-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 13-14, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988) (rejecting a facial challenge to a law regulating club membership and noting that \"[w]e could hardly hold otherwise on the record before us, which contains no specific evidence on the characteristics of <i>any</i> club covered by the [l]aw\"). This strikes us as especially true here, given that it was the voters of Washington themselves, rather than their elected representatives, who enacted I-872.</p>\n<p>Of course, it is <i>possible</i> that voters will misinterpret the candidates' party-preference designations as reflecting endorsement by the parties. But these cases involve a facial challenge, and we cannot strike down I-872 on its face based on the mere possibility of voter confusion. See <i>Yazoo,</i> 226 U.S., at 219, 33 S.Ct. 40 (\"[T]his court must deal with the case in hand and not with imaginary ones\"); <i>Pullman Co. v. Knott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98267\"><a href=\"/opinion/98267/pullman-co-v-knott/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 26, 35 S.Ct. 2, 59 L.Ed. 105 (1914) (A statute \"is not to be upset upon hypothetical and unreal possibilities, if it would be good upon the facts as they are\"). Because respondents brought their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1194</span> suit as a facial challenge, we have no evidentiary record against which to assess their assertions that voters will be confused. See <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S., at 375-376, 117 S.Ct. 1364 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (rejecting judgments based on \"imaginative theoretical sources of voter confusion\" and \"entirely hypothetical\" outcomes). Indeed, because I-872 has never been implemented, we do not even have ballots indicating how party preference will be displayed. It stands to reason that whether voters will be confused by the party-preference designations will depend in significant part on the form of the ballot. The Court of Appeals assumed that the ballot would not place abbreviations like \"`D'\" and \"`R,'\" or \"`Dem.'\" and \"`Rep.'\" after the names of candidates, but would instead \"clearly state that a particular candidate `prefers' a particular party.\" 460 F.3d, at 1121, n. 20. It thought that even such a clear statement did too little to eliminate the risk of voter confusion.</p>\n<p>But we see no reason to stop there. As long as we are speculating about the form of the ballot\u0097and we can do no more than speculate in this facial challenge\u0097we must, in fairness to the voters of the State of Washington who enacted I-872 and in deference to the executive and judicial officials who are charged with implementing it, ask whether the ballot could conceivably be printed in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of widespread voter confusion and with it the perceived threat to the First Amendment. See <i>Ayotte,</i> 546 U.S., at 329, 126 S.Ct. 961 (noting that courts should not nullify more of a state law than necessary so as to avoid frustrating the intent of the people and their duly elected representatives); <i>Ward v. Rock Against Racism,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112315\"><a href=\"/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span>, 795-796, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989) (\"`[I]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must . . . consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.'\" (quoting <i>Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110661\"><a href=\"/opinion/110661/hoffman-estates-v-flipside-hoffman-estates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 494, n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982))).</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to conceive of such a ballot. For example, petitioners propose that the actual I-872 ballot could include prominent disclaimers explaining that party preference reflects only the self-designation of the candidate and not an official endorsement by the party. They also suggest that the ballots might note preference in the form of a candidate statement that emphasizes the candidate's personal determination rather than the party's acceptance of the candidate, such as \"my party preference is the Republican Party.\" Additionally, the State could decide to educate the public about the new primary ballots through advertising or explanatory materials mailed to voters along with their ballots.<sup>[8]</sup> We are satisfied that there are a variety of ways in which the State could implement I-872 that would eliminate any real threat of voter confusion. And without the specter of widespread voter confusion, respondents' arguments about forced association<sup>[9]</sup> and compelled speech<sup>[10]</sup> fall flat.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1195</span> Our conclusion that these implementations of I-872 would be consistent with the First Amendment is fatal to respondents' facial challenge. See <i>Schall v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111198\"><a href=\"/opinion/111198/schall-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 264, 104 S.Ct. 2403, 81 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984) (a facial challenge fails where \"at least some\" constitutional applications exist). Each of their arguments rests on factual assumptions about voter confusion, and each fails for the same reason: In the absence of evidence, we cannot assume that Washington's voters will be misled. See <i>Jones,</i> 530 U.S., at 600, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"[A]n empirically debatable assumption . . . is too thin a reed to support a credible First Amendment distinction\" between permissible and impermissible burdens on association). That factual determination must await an as-applied challenge. On its face, I-872 does not impose any severe burden on respondents' associational rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Because we have concluded that I-872 does not severely burden respondents, the State need not assert a compelling interest. See <i>Clingman,</i> 544 U.S., at 593, 125 S.Ct. 2029 (\"When a state electoral provision places no heavy burden on associational rights, `a State's important regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions'\" (quoting <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S., at 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364)). The State's asserted interest in providing voters with relevant information about the candidates on the ballot is easily sufficient to sustain I-872. See <i>Anderson,</i> 460 U.S., at 796, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (\"There can be no question about the legitimacy of the State's interest in fostering informed and educated expressions of the popular will in a general election\").<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Respondents ask this Court to invalidate a popularly enacted election process that has never been carried out. Immediately after implementing regulations were enacted, respondents obtained a permanent injunction against the enforcement of I-872. The First Amendment does not require <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1196</span> this extraordinary and precipitous nullification of the will of the people. Because I-872 does not on its face provide for the nomination of candidates or compel political parties to associate with or endorse candidates, and because there is no basis in this facial challenge for presuming that candidates' party-preference designations will confuse voters, I-872 does not on its face severely burden respondents' associational rights. We accordingly hold that I-872 is facially constitutional. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice ALITO joins, concurring.</p>\n<p>I share Justice SCALIA's concern that permitting a candidate to identify his political party preference on an official election ballot\u0097regardless of whether the candidate is endorsed by the party or is even a member\u0097may effectively force parties to accept candidates they do not want, amounting to forced association in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p>I do think, however, that whether voters <i>perceive</i> the candidate and the party to be associated is relevant to the constitutional inquiry. Our other forced-association cases indicate as much. In <i>Boy Scouts of America v. Dale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 653, 120 S.Ct. 2446, 147 L.Ed.2d 554 (2000), we said that Dale's presence in the Boy Scouts would \"force the organization to send a message . . . [to] the world\" that the Scouts approved of homosexuality. In other words, accepting Dale would lead outsiders to believe the Scouts endorsed homosexual conduct. Largely for that reason, we held that the First Amendment entitled the Scouts to exclude Dale. <i>Id.,</i> at 659, 120 S.Ct. 2446. Similarly, in <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117960\"><a href=\"/opinion/117960/hurley-v-irish-american-gay-lesbian-and-bisexual-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span>, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995), we allowed the organizers of Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade to exclude a pro-gay rights float because the float's presence in the parade might create the impression that the organizers agreed with the float-sponsors' message. See <i>id.,</i> at 575-577, 115 S.Ct. 2338.</p>\n<p>Voter perceptions matter, and if voters do not actually believe the parties and the candidates are tied together, it is hard to see how the parties' associational rights are adversely implicated. See <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 65, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006) (rejecting law schools' First Amendment objection to military recruiters on campus because no reasonable person would believe the \"law schools agree[d] with any speech by recruiters\"). After all, individuals frequently claim to favor this or that political party; these preferences, without more, do not create an unconstitutional forced association.</p>\n<p>What makes these cases different, as Justice SCALIA explains, is the place where the candidates express their party preferences: on the ballot. See <i>post,</i> at 1199 (dissenting opinion) (noting \"the special role that a state-printed ballot plays in elections\"). And what makes the ballot \"special\" is precisely the effect it has on voter impressions. See <i>Cook v. Gralike,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621075\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621075/cook-v-gralike/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 532, 121 S.Ct. 1029, 149 L.Ed.2d 44 (2001) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment) (\"[T]he ballot . . . is the last thing the voter sees before he makes his choice\"); <i>Anderson v.

Petitioners themselves emphasize that the content of the ballots in the pertinent respect is yet to be determined. See Reply Brief for Washington State Grange 2-4, 7-13.</p>\n<p>If the ballot is designed in such a manner that no reasonable voter would believe that the candidates listed there are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated with, the parties the candidates claimed to \"prefer,\" the I-872 primary system would likely pass constitutional muster. I cannot say on the present record that it would be impossible for the State to design such a ballot. Assuming the ballot is so designed, voters would not regard the listed candidates as \"party\" candidates, any more than someone saying \"I like Campbell's soup\" would be understood to be associated with Campbell's. Voters would understand that the candidate does not speak on the party's behalf or with the party's approval. On the other hand, if the ballot merely lists the candidates' preferred parties next to the candidates' names, or otherwise fails clearly to convey that the parties and the candidates are not necessarily associated, the I-872 system would not survive a First Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA complains that \"[i]t is hard to know how to respond\" to such mistaken views, <i>post,</i> at 1200 (dissenting opinion), but he soldiers on nonetheless. He would hold that a party is burdened by a candidate's statement of preference even if no reasonable voter believes from the ballot that the party and the candidate are associated. I take his point to be that a particular candidate's \"endorsement\" of a party might alter the party's message, and this violates the party's freedom of association. See <i>post,</i> at 1200-1201 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>But there is no general right to stop an individual from saying, \"I prefer this party,\" even if the party would rather he not. Normally, the party protects its message in such a case through responsive speech of its own. What makes this case different of course is that the State controls the content of the ballot, which we have never considered a public forum. See <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118102\"><a href=\"/opinion/118102/timmons-v-twin-cities-area-new-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 363, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997) (ballots are not \"forums for political expression\"). Neither the candidate nor the party dictates the message conveyed by the ballot. In such a case, it is important to know what the ballot actually says\u0097both about the candidate and about the party's association with the candidate. It is possible that no reasonable voter in Washington State will regard the listed candidates as members of, or otherwise associated with, the political parties the candidates claim to prefer. Nothing in my analysis requires the parties to produce studies regarding voter perceptions on this score, but I would wait to see what the ballot says before deciding whether it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Still, I agree with Justice SCALIA that the history of the challenged law suggests the State is not particularly interested in devising ballots that meet these constitutional requirements. See <i>post,</i> at 1201 (dissenting opinion). But this record simply does not allow us to say with certainty that the election system created by I-872 is unconstitutional. Accordingly, I agree with the Court that respondents' present challenge to the law must fail, and I join the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The electorate's perception of a political party's beliefs is colored by its perception of those who support the party; and a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1198</span> party's defining act is the selection of a candidate and advocacy of that candidate's election by conferring upon him the party's endorsement. When the state-printed ballot for the general election causes a party to be associated with candidates who may not fully (if at all) represent its views, it undermines both these vital aspects of political association. The views of the self-identified party supporter color perception of the party's message, and that self-identification on the ballot, with no space for party repudiation or party identification of its own candidate, impairs the party's advocacy of its standard bearer. Because Washington has not demonstrated that this severe burden upon parties' associational rights is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest\u0097indeed, because it seems to me Washington's only plausible interest is precisely to reduce the effectiveness of political parties\u0097I would find the law unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>I begin with the principles on which the Court and I agree. States may not use election regulations to undercut political parties' freedoms of speech or association. See <i>U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117935\"><a href=\"/opinion/117935/us-term-limits-inc-v-thornton/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">779</span></a></span>, 833-834, 115 S.Ct. 1842, 131 L.Ed.2d 881 (1995). Thus, when a State regulates political parties as a part of its election process, we consider \"the `character and magnitude'\" of the burden imposed on the party's associational rights and \"the extent to which the State's concerns make the burden necessary.\" <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118102\"><a href=\"/opinion/118102/timmons-v-twin-cities-area-new-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span>, 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997).

We therefore held, for example, that a State severely burdened the right of expressive association when it required the Boy Scouts to accept an openly gay scoutmaster. The scoutmaster's presence \"would, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.\" <i>Boy Scouts of America v.

See, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1199</span> e.g., <i>App. 239 (Declaration of Democratic Committee Chair Paul J. Berendt); J. Aldrich, Why Parties? 48-49 (1995). They then encourage voters to cast their votes for the candidates that carry the party name. Parties' efforts to support candidates by marking them with the party trademark, so to speak, have been successful enough to make the party name, in the words of one commentator, \"the most important resource that the party possesses.\" Cain, Party Autonomy and Two-Party Electoral Competition, 149 U. Pa. L.Rev. 793, 804 (2001). And all evidence suggests party labels are indeed a central consideration for most voters.

Research Q. 709 (2001).</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The State of Washington need not like, and need not favor, political parties. It is entirely free to decline running primaries for the selection of party nominees and to hold nonpartisan general elections in which party labels have no place on the ballot. See <i>California Democratic Party v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118382\"><a href=\"/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 585-586, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000). Parties would then be left to their own devices in both selecting and publicizing their candidates. But Washington has done more than merely decline to make its electoral machinery available for party building. Recognizing that parties draw support for their candidates by giving them the party imprimatur, Washington seeks to reduce the effectiveness of that endorsement by allowing <i>any</i> candidate to use the ballot for drawing upon the goodwill that a party has developed, while preventing the party from using the ballot to reject the claimed association or to identify the genuine candidate of its choice. This does not merely place the ballot off limits for party building; it makes the ballot an instrument by which party building is impeded, permitting unrebutted associations that the party itself does not approve.</p>\n<p>These cases cannot be decided without taking account of the special role that a state-printed ballot plays in elections. The ballot comes into play \"at the most crucial stage in the electoral process\u0097the instant before the vote is cast.\" <i>Anderson v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106727\"><a href=\"/opinion/106727/dupuy-h-anderson-v-wade-o-martin-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 402, 84 S.Ct. 454, 11 L.Ed.2d 430 (1964). It is the only document that all voters are guaranteed to see, and it is \"the last thing the voter sees before he makes his choice,\" <i>Cook v. Gralike,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621075\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621075/cook-v-gralike/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span>, 532, 121 S.Ct. 1029, 149 L.Ed.2d 44 (2001) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment). Thus, we have held that a State cannot elevate a particular issue to prominence by making it the only issue for which the ballot sets forth the candidates' positions. <i>Id.,</i> at 525-526, 121 S.Ct. 1029 (opinion of the Court). And we held unconstitutional California's election system, which listed as the party's candidate on the general election ballot the candidate selected in a state-run \"blanket primary\" in which all citizens could determine who would be the party's nominee. <i>Jones,</i> 530 U.S., at 586, 120 S.Ct. 2402. It was not enough to sustain the law that the party remained free to select its preferred candidate through another process, and could denounce or campaign against the candidate carrying the party's name on the general election ballot. Forced association with the party on the general election ballot was fatal. <i>Id.,</i> at 575-577, 120 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n<p>The Court makes much of the fact that the party names shown on the Washington ballot may be billed as mere statements of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1200</span> candidate \"preference.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1193-1195. To be sure, the party is not <i>itself</i> forced to display favor for someone it does not wish to associate with, as the Boy Scouts were arguably forced to do by employing the homosexual scoutmaster in <i>Dale,</i> and as the political parties were arguably forced to do by lending their ballot-endorsement as party nominee in <i>Jones.</i> But thrusting an unwelcome, self-proclaimed association upon the party on the election ballot itself is amply destructive of the party's associational rights. An individual's endorsement of a party shapes the voter's view of what the party stands for, no less than the party's endorsement of an individual shapes the voter's view of what the individual stands for. That is why party nominees are often asked (and regularly agree) to repudiate the support of persons regarded as racial extremists. On Washington's ballot, such repudiation is impossible. And because the ballot is the only document voters are guaranteed to see, and the last thing they see before casting their vote, there is \"no means of replying\" that \"would be equally effective with the voter.\" <i>Cook, supra,</i> at 532, 121 S.Ct. 1029 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Not only is the party's message distorted, but its goodwill is hijacked. There can be no dispute that candidate acquisition of party labels on Washington's ballot\u0097even if billed as self-identification\u0097is a means of garnering the support of those who trust and agree with the party. The \"I prefer the D's\" and \"I prefer the R's\" will not be on the ballot for esthetic reasons; they are designed to link candidates to unwilling parties (or at least parties who are unable to express their revulsion) and to encourage voters to cast their ballots based in part on the trust they place in the party's name and the party's philosophy. These harms will be present no matter how Washington's law is implemented. There is therefore \"no set of circumstances\" under which Washington's law would not severely burden political parties, see <i>United States v. Salerno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111891\"><a href=\"/opinion/111891/united-states-v-salerno/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987), and no good reason to wait until Washington has undermined its political parties to declare that it is forbidden to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE would wait to see if the law is implemented in a manner that no more harms political parties than allowing a person to state that he \"`like[s] Campbell's soup'\" would harm the Campbell Soup Company. See <i>ante,</i> at 1188 (concurring opinion). It is hard to know how to respond. First and most fundamentally, there is simply no comparison between statements of \"preference\" for an expressive association and statements of \"preference\" for soup. The robust First Amendment freedom to associate belongs only to groups \"engage[d] in `expressive association,'\" <i>Dale,</i> 530 U.S., at 648, 120 S.Ct. 2446. The Campbell Soup Company does not exist to promote a message, and \"there is only minimal constitutional protection of the freedom of <i>commercial</i> association,\" <i>Roberts v. United States Jaycees,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111255\"><a href=\"/opinion/111255/roberts-v-united-states-jaycees/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 634, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>Second, I assuredly do not share THE CHIEF JUSICE's view that the First Amendment will be satisfied so long as the ballot \"is designed in such a manner that no reasonable voter would believe that the candidates listed there are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated with, the parties the candidates claimed to `prefer.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1188. To begin with, it seems to me quite impossible for the ballot to satisfy a reasonable voter that the candidate is not \"associated with\" the party for which he has expressed a preference. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1201</span> He has associated <i>himself</i> with the party by his very expression of a preference\u0097 and that indeed is the whole purpose of allowing the preference to be expressed. If all The Chief Justice means by \"associated with\" is that the candidate \"does not speak on the party's behalf or with the party's approval,\" <i>ibid.,</i> none of my analysis in this opinion relies upon that misperception, nor upon the misperception that the candidate is a member or the nominee of the party. Avoiding those misperceptions is far from enough. Is it enough to say on the ballot that a notorious and despised racist who says that the party is his choice does not speak with the party's approval? Surely not. His unrebutted association of that party with his views distorts the image of the party nonetheless. And the fact that the candidate who expresses a \"preference\" for one or another party is shown not to be the nominee of that party does not deprive him of the boost from the party's reputation which the party wishes to confer only on its nominee. The Chief Justice claims that \"the content of the ballots in the pertinent respect is yet to be determined,\" <i>ibid.</i> I disagree. We know all we need to know about the form of ballot. When pressed, Washington's Attorney General assured us at oral argument that the ballot will <i>not</i> say whether the party for whom the candidate expresses a preference claims or disavows him. (Of course it will not, for that would enable the party expression that it is the very object of this legislation to impair.)</p>\n<p>And finally, while THE CHIEF JUSTICE earlier expresses his awareness that the special character of the ballot is what makes these cases different, <i>ante,</i> at 1188, his Campbell's Soup example seems to forget that. If we must speak in terms of soup, Washington's law is like a law that encourages Oscar the Grouch (Sesame Street's famed bad-taste resident of a garbage can) to state a \"preference\" for Campbell's at every point of sale, while barring the soup company from disavowing his endorsement, or indeed using its name at all, in those same crucial locations. Reserving the most critical communications forum for statements of \"preference\" by a potentially distasteful speaker alters public perceptions of the entity that is \"preferred\"; and when this privileged connection undermines not a company's ability to identify and promote soup but an expressive association's ability to identify and promote its message and its standard bearer, the State treads on the constitutionally protected freedom of association.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion and THE CHIEF JUSTICE's concurrence also endorse a wait-and-see approach on the grounds that it is not yet evident how the law will affect voter perception of the political parties. But contrary to the Court's suggestion, it is not incumbent on the political parties to adduce \"evidence,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1195, that forced association affects their ability to advocate for their candidates and their causes. We have never put expressive groups to this perhaps-impossible task. Rather, we accept their own assessments of the matter. The very cases on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE relies for a wait-and-see approach, <i>ante,</i> at 1187-1188, establish as much. In <i>Dale,</i> for example, we did not require the Boy Scouts to prove that forced acceptance of the openly homosexual scoutmaster would distort their message. See 530 U.S., at 653, 120 S.Ct. 2446 (citing <i>La Follette,</i> 450 U.S., at 123-124, 101 S.Ct. 1010). Nor in <i>Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117960\"><a href=\"/opinion/117960/hurley-v-irish-american-gay-lesbian-and-bisexual-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span>, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995), did we require the organizers of the St. Patrick's Day Parade to demonstrate that including a gay contingent in the parade would distort their message. See <i>id.,</i> at <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1202</span> 577, 115 S.Ct. 2338. Nor in <i>Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118382\"><a href=\"/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502, did we require the political parties to demonstrate either that voters would incorrectly perceive the \"nominee\" labels on the ballot to be the products of party elections or that the labels would change voter perceptions of the party. It does not take a study to establish that when statements of party connection are the sole information listed next to candidate names on the ballot, those statements will affect voters' perceptions of what the candidate stands for, what the party stands for, and whom they should elect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Since I conclude that Washington's law imposes a severe burden on political parties' associational rights, I would uphold the law only if it were \"narrowly tailored\" to advance \"a compelling state interest.\" <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S., at 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364. Neither the Court's opinion nor the State's submission claims that Washington's law passes such scrutiny. The State argues only that it \"has a rational basis\" for \"providing voters with a modicum of relevant information about the candidates,\" Brief for Petitioners in No. 06-730, pp. 48-49. This is the only interest the Court's opinion identifies as well. <i>Ante,</i> at 1195.</p>\n<p>But \"rational basis\" is the <i>least</i> demanding of our tests; it is the same test that allows individuals to be taxed at different rates because they are in different businesses. See <i>Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105832\"><a href=\"/opinion/105832/allied-stores-of-ohio-inc-v-bowers/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 526-527, 79 S.Ct. 437, 3 L.Ed.2d 480 (1959). It falls far, far short of establishing the compelling state interest that the First Amendment requires. And to tell the truth, here even the existence of a rational basis is questionable. Allowing candidates to identify themselves with particular parties on the ballot displays the State's view that adherence to party philosophy is \"an important\u0097perhaps paramount\u0097consideration in the citizen's choice.\" <i>Anderson,</i> 375 U.S., at 402, 84 S.Ct. 454. If that is so, however, it seems to me irrational not to allow the party to disclaim that self-association, or to identify its own endorsed candidate.</p>\n<p>It is no mystery what is going on here. There is no state interest behind this law except the Washington Legislature's dislike for bright-colors partisanship, and its desire to blunt the ability of political parties with noncentrist views to endorse and advocate their own candidates. That was the purpose of the Washington system that this enactment was adopted to replace\u0097a system indistinguishable from the one we invalidated in <i>Jones,</i> which required parties to allow nonmembers to join in the selection of the candidates shown as their nominees on the election ballot. (The system was held unconstitutional in <i>Democratic Party of Washington State v. Reed,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783589\"><a href=\"/opinion/783589/democratic-party-of-washington-state-paul-berendt-/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1198</span></a></span> (C.A.9 2003).) And it is the obvious purpose of Washington legislation enacted after this law, which requires political parties to repeat a candidate's self-declared party \"preference\" in electioneering communications concerning the candidate\u0097even if the purpose of the communication is to criticize the candidate and to disavow any connection between him and the party. Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 42.17.510(1) (2006); see also Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 390-18-020 (2007).</p>\n<p>Even if I were to assume, however, that Washington has a legitimate interest in telling voters on the ballot (above all other things) that a candidate <i>says</i> he favors a particular political party; and even if I were further to assume <i>(per impossibile)</i> that that interest was a compelling one; Washington would still have to \"narrowly tailor\" its law to protect that interest with minimal intrusion upon the parties' associational <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1203</span> rights. There has been no attempt to do that here. Washington could, for example, have permitted parties to disclaim on the general-election ballot the asserted association or to designate on the ballot their true nominees. The course the State has chosen makes sense only as an effort to use its monopoly power over the ballot to undermine the expressive activities of the political parties.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The right to associate for the election of candidates is fundamental to the operation of our political system, and state action impairing that association bears a heavy burden of justification. Washington's electoral system permits individuals to appropriate the parties' trademarks, so to speak, at the most crucial stage of election, thereby distorting the parties' messages and impairing their endorsement of candidates. The State's justification for this (to convey a \"modicum of relevant information\") is not only weak but undeserving of credence. We have here a system which, like the one it replaced, does not merely refuse to assist, but positively impairs, the legitimate role of political parties. I dissent from the Court's conclusion that the Constitution permits this sabotage.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The term \"blanket primary\" refers to a system in which \"any person, regardless of party affiliation, may vote for a party's nominee.\" <i>California Democratic Party v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118382\"><a href=\"/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span>, 576, n. 6, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000). A blanket primary is distinct from an \"open primary,\" in which a person may vote for any party's nominees, but must choose among that party's nominees for all offices, <i>ibid.,</i> and the more traditional \"closed primary\" in which \"only persons who are members of the political party . . . can vote on its nominee,\" <i>id.,</i> at 570, 120 S.Ct. 2402.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Washington State Grange is a fraternal, social, and civic organization chartered by the National Grange in 1889. Although originally formed to represent the interests of farmers, the organization has advocated a variety of goals, including women's suffrage, rural electrification, protection of water resources, and universal telephone service. The State Grange also supported the Washington constitutional amendment establishing initiatives and referendums and sponsored the 1934 blanket primary initiative.</p>\n<p>[3]  Respondents make much of the fact that the promoters of I-872 presented it to Washington voters as a way to preserve the primary system in place from 1935 to 2003. But our task is not to judge I-872 based on its promoters' assertions about its similarity, or lack thereof, to the unconstitutional primary; we must evaluate the constitutionality of I-872 on its own terms. Whether the language of I-872 was purposely drafted to survive a <i>Jones</i>-type constitutional challenge is irrelevant to whether it has successfully done so.</p>\n<p>[4]  \"`Partisan office' means a public office for which a candidate may indicate a political party preference on his or her declaration of candidacy and have that preference appear on the primary and general election ballot in conjunction with his or her name.\" Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 29A.04.110 (Supp.2005).</p>\n<p>[5]  This is not a hypothetical outcome. The Court of Appeals observed that, had the 1996 gubernatorial primary been conducted under the I-872 system, two Democratic candidates and no Republican candidate would have advanced from the primary to the general election.

We are aware of no case in which the mere <i>impression</i> of association was held to place a severe burden on a group's First Amendment rights, but we need not decide that question here.</p>\n<p>[10]  Relying on <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111596\"><a href=\"/opinion/111596/pacific-gas-elec-co-v-public-util-commn-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. 903, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (holding that a state agency may not require a utility company to include a third-party newsletter in its billing envelope), respondents argue that the threat of voter confusion will force them to speak to clarify their positions. Because I-872 does not actually force the parties to speak, however, <i>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.</i> is inapposite. I-872 does not require the parties to reproduce another's speech against their will; nor does it co-opt the parties' own conduits for speech. Rather, it simply provides a place on the ballot for candidates to designate their party preferences. Facilitation of speech to which a political party may choose to respond does not amount to forcing the political party to speak. Cf. <i>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145672\"><a href=\"/opinion/145672/rumsfeld-v-forum-for-academic-and-institutional-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 64-65, 126 S.Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed.2d 156 (2006).</p>\n<p>[11]  Respondent Libertarian Party of Washington argues that I-872 is unconstitutional because of its implications for ballot access, trademark protection of party names, and campaign finance. We do not consider the ballot access and trademark arguments as they were not addressed below and are not encompassed by the question on which we granted certiorari: \"Does Washington's primary election system . . . violate the associational rights of political parties because candidates are permitted to identify their political party preference on the ballot?\" Pet. for cert. in No. 06-730, p. i. The campaign finance issue also was not addressed below and is more suitable for consideration on remand.</p>\n\n</div>",
