Rose, Rose &amp; Rose, P.C., Washington, D.C., for the Respondents Holowecki, et al.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case arises under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <i>et seq.</i> When an employee files \"a charge alleging unlawful [age] discrimination\" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the charge sets the Act's enforcement mechanisms in motion, commencing a waiting period during which the employee cannot file suit. The phrase, \"a charge alleging unlawful discrimination,\" is used in the statute, \u00a7 626(d), and \"charge\" appears in the agency's implementing regulations; but it has no statutory definition. In deciding what constitutes a charge under the Act the Courts of Appeals have adopted different definitions. As a result, difficulties have arisen in determining when employees <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1153</span> may seek relief under the ADEA in courts of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>As a cautionary preface, we note that the EEOC enforcement mechanisms and statutory waiting periods for ADEA claims differ in some respects from those pertaining to other statutes the EEOC enforces, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 327, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <i>et seq.</i> While there may be areas of common definition, employees and their counsel must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination. Cf. <i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> 540 U.S. 581, 586-587, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004). This is so even if the EEOC forms and the same definition of charge apply in more than one type of discrimination case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx), provides mail pickup and delivery services to customers worldwide. In 1994 and 1995, FedEx initiated two programs, designed, it says, to make its 45,000-strong courier network more productive. The programs, \"Best Practice Pays\" (BPP) and \"Minimum Acceptable Performance Standards\" (MAPS), tied the couriers' compensation and continued employment to certain performance benchmarks, for instance the number of stops a courier makes per day.</p>\n<p>Respondents are 14 current and former FedEx couriers over the age of 40. They filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 30, 2002, claiming, <i>inter alia,</i> that BPP and MAPS violate the ADEA. Asserting that their claims were typical of many couriers nationwide, respondents sought to represent a plaintiffs' class of all couriers over the age of 40 who were subject to alleged acts of age discrimination by FedEx. The suit maintains that BPP and MAPS were veiled attempts to force older workers out of the company before they would be entitled to receive retirement benefits. FedEx, it is alleged, used the initiatives as a pretext for harassing and discriminating against older couriers in favor of younger ones.</p>\n<p>The immediate question before us is the timeliness of the suit filed by one of the plaintiffs below, Patricia Kennedy, referred to here as \"respondent.\" Petitioner moved to dismiss respondent's action, contending respondent had not filed her charge with the EEOC at least 60 days before filing suit, as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d). Respondent countered that she filed a valid charge on December 11, 2001, by submitting EEOC Form 283.</p>\n<p>The agency labels Form 283 an \"Intake Questionnaire.\" Respondent attached to the questionnaire a signed affidavit describing the alleged discriminatory employment practices in greater detail. The District Court determined these documents were not a charge and granted the motion to dismiss. No. 02 Civ. 3355(LMM) (SDNY, Oct. 9, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. An appeal followed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. See 440 F.3d 558, 570 (2006). We granted certiorari to consider whether respondent's filing was a charge, 551 U.S. ____, 127 S.Ct. 2914, 168 L.Ed.2d 242 (2007), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This case presents two distinct questions: What is a charge as the ADEA uses that term? And were the documents respondent filed in December 2001 a charge?</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1154</span> A</h2>\n<p>The relevant statutory provision states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No civil action may be commenced by an individual under [the ADEA] until 60 days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Upon receiving such a charge, the Commission shall promptly notify all persons named in such charge as prospective defendants in the action and shall promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d).</blockquote>\n<p>The Act does not define charge. While EEOC regulations give some content to the term, they fall short of a comprehensive definition. The agency has statutory authority to issue regulations, see \u00a7 628; and when an agency invokes its authority to issue regulations, which then interpret ambiguous statutory terms, the courts defer to its reasonable interpretations. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The regulations the agency has adopted\u0097so far as they go\u0097are reasonable constructions of the term charge. There is little dispute about this. The issue is the guidance the regulations give.</p>\n<p>One of the regulations, 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.3 (2007), is entitled \"Other definitions.\" It says: \"<i>charge</i> shall mean a statement filed with the Commission by or on behalf of an aggrieved person which alleges that the named prospective defendant has engaged in or is about to engage in actions in violation of the Act.\" Section 1626.8(a) identifies five pieces of information a \"charge should contain\": (1)-(2) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the person making the charge and the charged entity; (3) a statement of facts describing the alleged discriminatory act; (4) the number of employees of the charged employer; and (5) a statement indicating whether the charging party has initiated state proceedings. The next subsection, \u00a7 1626.8(b), however, seems to qualify these requirements by stating that a charge is \"sufficient\" if it meets the requirements of \u00a7 1626.6\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> if it is \"in writing and . . . name[s] the prospective respondent and . . . generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s).\"</p>\n<p>Even with the aid of the regulations the meaning of charge remains unclear, as is evident from the differing positions of the parties now before us and in the Courts of Appeals. Petitioner contends an Intake Questionnaire cannot be a charge unless the EEOC acts upon it. On the other hand some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, take a position similar to the Government's in this case, that an Intake Questionnaire can constitute a charge if it expresses the filer's intent to activate the EEOC's enforcement processes. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Steffen v. Meridian Life Ins. Co.,</i> 859 F.2d 534, 542 (C.A.7 1988). A third view, which seems to accord with respondent's position, is that all completed Intake Questionnaires are charges. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Casavantes v. California State Univ., Sacramento,</i> 732 F.2d 1441, 1443 (C.A.9 1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In support of her position that the Intake Questionnaire she filed, taken together with the attached six-page affidavit, meets the regulatory definition of a charge, respondent places considerable emphasis on what might be described as the regulations' catchall or savings provision, 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.8(b). This seems to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1155</span> require only a written document with a general allegation of discriminatory conduct by a named employer. Respondent points out that, when read together, \u00a7\u00a7 1626.8(b) and 1626.6 say that a \"charge is sufficient when the Commission receives. . . a written statement\" that \"name[s] the [employer] and . . . generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s).\" Respondent views this language as unequivocal and sees no basis for requiring that a charge contain any additional information.</p>\n<p>The EEOC's view, as expressed in the Government's <i>amicus</i> brief, however, is that the regulations identify certain requirements for a charge but do not provide an exhaustive definition. As such, not all documents that meet the minimal requirements of \u00a7 1626.6 are charges.</p>\n<p>The question, then, becomes how to interpret the scope of the regulations. Just as we defer to an agency's reasonable interpretations of the statute when it issues regulations in the first instance, see <i>Chevron, supra,</i> the agency is entitled to further deference when it adopts a reasonable interpretation of regulations it has put in force. See <i>Auer v. Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997). Under <i>Auer,</i> we accept the agency's position unless it is \"`\"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\"'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 461, 117 S.Ct. 905 (quoting <i>Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council,</i> 490 U.S. 332, 359, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989)).</p>\n<p>In accord with this standard we accept the agency's position that the regulations do not identify all necessary components of a charge; and it follows that a document meeting the requirements of \u00a7 1626.6 is not a charge in every instance. The language in \u00a7\u00a7 1626.6 and 1626.8 cannot be viewed in isolation from the rest of the regulations. True, the structure of the regulations is less than clear. But the relevant provisions are grouped under the title, \"Procedures\u0097Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\" A permissible reading is that the regulations identify the procedures for filing a charge but do not state the full contents a charge document must contain. This is the agency's position, and we defer to it under <i>Auer.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>This does not resolve the case. While we agree with the Government that the regulations do not state all the elements a charge must contain, the question of what additional elements are required remains. On this point the regulations are silent.</p>\n<p>The EEOC submits that the proper test for determining whether a filing is a charge is whether the filing, taken as a whole, should be construed as a request by the employee for the agency to take whatever action is necessary to vindicate her rights. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15. The EEOC has adopted this position in the Government's <i>amicus</i> brief and in various internal directives it has issued to its field offices over the years. See 1 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), p. 2:0001 (Aug.2002); Memorandum from Elizabeth M. Thornton, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Feb. 21, 2002), on line at http://www.eeoc. gov/charge/memo-2-21-02.html (hereinafter Thornton Memo) (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 21, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file); Memorandum from Nicholas M. Inzeo, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Field, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Aug. 13, 2007), on line at http://www.eeoc.gov/charge/memo-8-13-07.html. The Government asserts that this request-to-act requirement is a reasonable extrapolation of the agency's regulations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1156</span> and that, as a result, the agency's position is dispositive under <i>Auer.</i></p>\n<p>The Government acknowledges the regulations do not, on their face, speak to the filer's intent. To the extent the request-to-act requirement can be derived from the text of the regulations, it must spring from the term charge. But, in this context, the term charge is not a construct of the agency's regulations. It is a term Congress used in the underlying statute that has been incorporated in the regulations by the agency. Thus, insofar as they speak to the filer's intent, the regulations do so by repeating language from the underlying statute. It could be argued, then, that this case can be distinguished from <i>Auer.</i> See <i>Gonzales v. Oregon,</i> 546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (the \"near equivalence of the statute and regulation belies [the case for] <i>Auer</i> deference\"); <i>Christensen v. Harris County,</i> 529 U.S. 576, 588, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000) (an agency cannot \"under the guise of interpreting a regulation . . . create <i>de facto</i> a new regulation\").</p>\n<p>It is not necessary to hold that <i>Auer</i> deference applies to the agency's construction of the term charge as it is used in the regulations, however. For even if <i>Auer</i> deference is inapplicable, we would accept the agency's proposed construction of the statutory term, and we turn next to the reasons for this conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>In our view the agency's policy statements, embodied in its compliance manual and internal directives, interpret not only the regulations but also the statute itself. Assuming these interpretive statements are not entitled to full <i>Chevron</i> deference, they do reflect \"`a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.'\" <i>Bragdon v. Abbott,</i> 524 U.S. 624, 642, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998) (quoting <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944)). As such, they are entitled to a \"measure of respect\" under the less deferential <i>Skidmore</i> standard. <i>Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA,</i> 540 U.S. 461, 487, 488, 124 S.Ct. 983, 157 L.Ed.2d 967 (2004); <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 227-239, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001).</p>\n<p>Under <i>Skidmore,</i> we consider whether the agency has applied its position with consistency. <i>Mead Corp., supra,</i> at 228, 121 S.Ct. 2164; <i>Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala,</i> 508 U.S. 402, 417, 113 S.Ct. 2151, 124 L.Ed.2d 368 (1993). Here, the relevant interpretive statement, embodied in the compliance manual and memoranda, has been binding on EEOC staff for at least five years. See Thornton Memo, <i>supra.</i> True, as the Government concedes, the agency's implementation of this policy has been uneven. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25. In the very case before us the EEOC's Tampa field office did not treat respondent's filing as a charge, as the Government now maintains it should have done. And, as a result, respondent filed suit before the agency could initiate a conciliation process with the employer.</p>\n<p>These undoubted deficiencies in the agency's administration of the statute and its regulatory scheme are not enough, however, to deprive the agency of all judicial deference. Some degree of inconsistent treatment is unavoidable when the agency processes over 175,000 inquiries a year. <i>Id.,</i> at 19, n. 10. And although one of the policy memoranda the Government relies upon was circulated after we granted certiorari, the position the document takes is consistent with the EEOC's previous directives. We see no reason to assume the agency's position\u0097that a charge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1157</span> is filed when the employee requests some action\u0097was framed for the specific purpose of aiding a party in this litigation. Cf. <i>Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital,</i> 488 U.S. 204, 212-213, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988).</p>\n<p>The EEOC, moreover, has drawn our attention to the need to define charge in a way that allows the agency to fulfill its distinct statutory functions of enforcing antidiscrimination laws and disseminating information about those laws to the public. Cf. <i>Barnhart v. Walton,</i> 535 U.S. 212, 225, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002) (noting that deference is appropriate in \"matters of detail related to [an agency's] administration\" of a statute). The agency's duty to initiate informal dispute resolution processes upon receipt of a charge is mandatory in the ADEA context. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d) (\"[T]he Commission . . . shall promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion\"); Cf. <i>Lopez v. Davis,</i> 531 U.S. 230, 241, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001) (noting that Congress' use of the term \"`shall'\" indicates an intent to \"impose discretionless obligations\"). Yet, at the same time, Congress intended the agency to serve an \"educational\" function. See Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 705(i), 78 Stat. 259; <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 705(g)(3) (noting that the Commission shall have the power to \"furnish to persons subject to this title such technical assistance as they may request\"). Providing answers to the public's questions is a critical part of the EEOC's mission; and it accounts for a substantial part of the agency's work. Of about 175,000 inquiries the agency receives each year, it dockets around 76,000 of these as charges. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19, n. 10. Even allowing for errors in the classification of charges and noncharges, it is evident that many filings come from individuals who have questions about their rights and simply want information.</p>\n<p>For efficient operations, and to effect congressional intent, the agency requires some mechanism to separate information requests from enforcement requests. Respondent's proposed standard, that a charge need contain only an allegation of discrimination and the name of the employer, falls short in this regard. Were that stripped-down standard to prevail, individuals who approach the agency with questions could end up divulging enough information to create a charge. This likely would be the case for anyone who completes an Intake Questionnaire\u0097which provides space to indicate the name and address of the offending employer and asks the individual to answer the question, \"What action was taken against you that you believe to be discrimination?\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a. If an individual knows that reporting this minimal information to the agency will mandate the agency to notify her employer, she may be discouraged from consulting the agency or wait until her employment situation has become so untenable that conciliation efforts would be futile. The result would be contrary to Congress' expressed desire that the EEOC act as an information provider and try to settle employment disputes through informal means.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the definition of charge respondent advocates\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> that it need conform only to 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.6\u0097is in considerable tension with the structure and purposes of the ADEA. The agency's interpretive position\u0097the request-to-act requirement\u0097provides a reasonable alternative that is consistent with the statutory framework. No clearer alternatives are within our authority or expertise to adopt; and so deference to the agency is appropriate under <i>Skidmore.</i> We conclude as follows: In addition to the information required <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1158</span> by the regulations, <i>i.e.,</i> an allegation and the name of the charged party, if a filing is to be deemed a charge it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee.</p>\n<p>Some Courts of Appeals have referred to a \"`manifest intent'\" test, under which, in order to be deemed a charge, the filing must demonstrate \"an individual's intent to have the agency initiate its investigatory and conciliatory processes.\" 440 F.3d, at 566 (case below); see also <i>Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp.,</i> 270 F.3d 1314, 1319 (C.A.11 2001); <i>Steffen,</i> 859 F.2d, at 543; <i>Bihler v. Singer Co.,</i> 710 F.2d 96, 99 (C.A.3 1983). If this formulation suggests the filer's state of mind is somehow determinative, it misses the point. If, however, it means the filing must be examined from the standpoint of an objective observer to determine whether, by a reasonable construction of its terms, the filer requests the agency to activate its machinery and remedial processes, that would be in accord with our conclusion.</p>\n<p>It is true that under this permissive standard a wide range of documents might be classified as charges. But this result is consistent with the design and purpose of the ADEA. Even in the formal litigation context, <i>pro se</i> litigants are held to a lesser pleading standard than other parties. See <i>Estelle v. Gamble,</i> 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (<i>Pro se</i> pleadings are to be \"liberally construed\"). In the administrative context now before us it appears <i>pro se</i> filings may be the rule, not the exception. The ADEA, like Title VII, sets up a \"remedial scheme in which laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process.\" <i>EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co.,</i> 486 U.S. 107, 124, 108 S.Ct. 1666, 100 L.Ed.2d 96 (1988); see also <i>Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. v. Evans,</i> 441 U.S. 750, 756, 99 S.Ct. 2066, 60 L.Ed.2d 609 (1979) (noting the \"common purpose\" of Title VII and the ADEA). The system must be accessible to individuals who have no detailed knowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms and agency processes. It thus is consistent with the purposes of the Act that a charge can be a form, easy to complete, or an informal document, easy to draft. The agency's proposed test implements these purposes.</p>\n<p>Reasonable arguments can be made that the agency should adopt a standard giving more guidance to filers, making it clear that the request to act must be stated in quite explicit terms. A rule of that sort might yield more consistent results. This, however, is a matter for the agency to decide in light of its experience and expertise in protecting the rights of those who are covered by the Act. For its decisions in this regard the agency is subject to the oversight of the political branches. Cf. <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,</i> 545 U.S. 967, 980, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (\"Filling these gaps [in ambiguous statutes] involves difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts\"). We find no reason in this case to depart from our usual rule: Where ambiguities in statutory analysis and application are presented, the agency may choose among reasonable alternatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>Asserting its interest as an employer, petitioner urges us to condition the definition of charge, and hence an employee's ability to sue, upon the EEOC's fulfilling its mandatory duty to notify the charged party and initiate a conciliation process. In petitioner's view, because the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1159</span> Commission must act \"[u]pon receiving such a charge,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d), its failure to do so means the filing is not a charge.</p>\n<p>The agency rejects this view, as do we. As a textual matter, the proposal is too artificial a reading of the statute to accept. The statute requires the aggrieved individual to file a charge before filing a lawsuit; it does not condition the individual's right to sue upon the agency taking any action. <i>Ibid.</i> (\"No civil action may be commenced by an individual under [the ADEA] until 60 days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\"); Cf. <i>Edelman v. Lynchburg College,</i> 535 U.S. 106, 112-113, 122 S.Ct. 1145, 152 L.Ed.2d 188 (2002) (rejecting the argument that a charge is not a charge until the filer satisfies Title VII's oath or affirmation requirement). The filing of a charge, moreover, determines when the Act's time limits and procedural mechanisms commence. It would be illogical and impractical to make the definition of charge dependent upon a condition subsequent over which the parties have no control. Cf. <i>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.,</i> 455 U.S. 422, 444, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Having determined that the agency acted within its authority in formulating the rule that a filing is deemed a charge if the document reasonably can be construed to request agency action and appropriate relief on the employee's behalf, the question is whether the filing here meets this test. The agency says it does, and we agree. The agency's determination is a reasonable exercise of its authority to apply its own regulations and procedures in the course of the routine administration of the statute it enforces.</p>\n<p>Respondent's completed intake form contained all of the information outlined in 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.8, including: the employee's name, address, and telephone number, as well as those of her employer; an allegation that she and other employees had been the victims of \"age discrimination\"; the number of employees who worked at the Dunedin, Florida, facility where she was stationed; and a statement indicating she had not sought the assistance of any government agency regarding this matter. See App. 265.</p>\n<p>Petitioner maintains the filing was still deficient because it contained no request for the agency to act. Were the Intake Questionnaire the only document before us we might agree its handwritten statements do not request action. The design of the form in use in 2001, moreover, does not give rise to the inference that the employee requests action against the employer. Unlike EEOC Form 5, the Intake Questionnaire is not labeled a \"Charge of Discrimination,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 275. In fact the wording of the questionnaire suggests the opposite: that the form's purpose is to facilitate \"pre-charge filing counseling\" and to enable the agency to determine whether it has jurisdiction over \"potential charges.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 265. There might be instances where the indicated discrimination is so clear or pervasive that the agency could infer from the allegations themselves that action is requested and required, but the agency is not required to treat every completed Intake Questionnaire as a charge.</p>\n<p>In this case, however, the completed questionnaire filed in December 2001 was supplemented with a detailed six-page affidavit. At the end of the last page, respondent asked the agency to \"[p]lease force Federal Express to end their age discrimination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1160</span> plan so we can finish out our careers absent the unfairness and hostile work environment created within their application of <i>Best Practice/High-Velocity Culture Change.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 273. This is properly construed as a request for the agency to act.</p>\n<p>Petitioner says that, in context, the statement is ambiguous. It points to respondent's accompanying statement that \"I have been given assurances by an Agent of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that this Affidavit will be considered confidential by the United States Government and will not be disclosed as long as the case remains open unless it becomes necessary for the Government to produce the affidavit in a formal proceeding.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 266. Petitioner argues that if respondent intended the affidavit to be kept confidential, she could not have expected the agency to treat it as a charge. This reads too much into the assurance of nondisclosure. Respondent did not request the agency to avoid contacting her employer. She stated only her understanding that the affidavit itself would be kept confidential. Even then, she gave consent for the agency to disclose the affidavit in a \"formal proceeding.\" Furthermore, respondent checked a box on the Intake Questionnaire giving consent for the agency to disclose her identity to the employer. <i>Id.,</i> at 265. Here the combination of the waiver and respondent's request in the affidavit that the agency \"force\" the employer to stop discriminating against her were enough to bring the entire filing within the definition of charge we adopt here.</p>\n<p>Petitioner notes that respondent did file a Form 5 (a formal charge) with the EEOC but only after she filed her complaint in the District Court. This shows, petitioner argues, that respondent did not intend the earlier December 2001 filing to be a charge; otherwise, there would have been no reason for the later filing. What matters, however, is whether the documents filed in December 2001 should be interpreted as a request for the agency to act. Postfiling conduct does not nullify an earlier, proper charge.</p>\n<p>Documents filed by an employee with the EEOC should be construed, to the extent consistent with permissible rules of interpretation, to protect the employee's rights and statutory remedies. Construing ambiguities against the drafter may be the more efficient rule to encourage precise expression in other contexts; here, however, the rule would undermine the remedial scheme Congress adopted. It would encourage individuals to avoid filing errors by retaining counsel, increasing both the cost and likelihood of litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Federal Government interacts with individual citizens through all but countless forms, schedules, manuals, and worksheets. Congress, in most cases, delegates the format and design of these instruments to the agencies that administer the relevant laws and processes. An assumption underlying the congressional decision to delegate rulemaking and enforcement authority to the agency, and the consequent judicial rule of deference to the agency's determinations, is that the agency will take all efforts to ensure that affected parties will receive the full benefits and protections of the law. Here, because the agency failed to treat respondent's filing as a charge in the first instance, both sides lost the benefits of the ADEA's informal dispute resolution process.</p>\n<p>The employer's interests, in particular, were given short shrift, for it was not notified of respondent's complaint until she filed suit. The court that hears the merits of this litigation can attempt to remedy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1161</span> this deficiency by staying the proceedings to allow an opportunity for conciliation and settlement. True, that remedy would be imperfect. Once the adversary process has begun a dispute may be in a more rigid cast than if conciliation had been attempted at the outset.</p>\n<p>This result is unfortunate, but, at least in this case, unavoidable. While courts will use their powers to fashion the best relief possible in situations like this one, the ultimate responsibility for establishing a clearer, more consistent process lies with the agency. The agency already has made some changes to the charge-filing process. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3, n. 2 (noting that the Intake Questionnaire form respondent filed has been replaced with a reworded form). To reduce the risk of further misunderstandings by those who seek its assistance, the agency should determine, in the first instance, what additional revisions in its forms and processes are necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the Court decides that a \"charge\" of age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) is whatever the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) says it is. The filing at issue in this case did not state that it was a charge and did not include a charge form; to the contrary, it included a form that expressly stated it was for the purpose of \"precharge\" counseling. What is more, the EEOC did not assign it a charge number, notify the employer of the complainant's<sup>[1]</sup> allegations, or commence enforcement proceedings. Notwithstanding these facts, the Court concludes, counterintuitively, that respondent's filing is a charge because it manifests an intent for the EEOC to take \"some action.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1156-1157. Because the standard the Court applies is broader than the ordinary meaning of the term \"charge,\" and because it is so malleable that it effectively absolves the EEOC of its obligation to administer the ADEA according to discernible standards, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>As the Court notes, the ADEA directs the agency to take certain actions upon receipt of a \"charge\" but does not define that word. <i>Ante,</i> at 1153-1154. Because there is nothing to suggest that Congress used \"charge\" as a term of art, we must construe it \"in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning.\" See <i>FDIC v. Meyer,</i> 510 U.S. 471, 476, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). Dictionaries define a \"charge\" as an accusation or indictment. See, <i>e.g.,</i> American Heritage Dictionary 312 (4th ed.2000); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 377 (1993). In legal parlance, a \"charge\" is generally a formal allegation of wrongdoing that initiates legal proceedings against an alleged wrongdoer. In criminal law, for example, a charge is defined as \"[a] formal accusation of an offense as a preliminary step to prosecution.\" Black's Law Dictionary 248 (8th ed.2004). Similarly, in this context, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1162</span> \"charge\" is a formal accusation of discrimination that objectively manifests an intent to initiate enforcement proceedings against the employer. Just as a complaint or police report that describes the commission of a crime is not a \"charge\" under the criminal law, so too here, a document that merely describes the alleged discrimination and requests the EEOC's assistance, but does not objectively manifest an intent to initiate enforcement proceedings, is not a \"charge\" within the meaning of the ADEA.</p>\n<p>This understanding of a \"charge\" is common in administrative law. The regulations governing allegations of unlawful employment practices at the Government Accountability Office, for example, define \"charge\" as \"any request filed . . . to investigate any matter\" within the jurisdiction of the agency. 4 CFR \u00a7 28.3 (2006). In actions alleging unfair labor practices, the \"purpose of the charge is . . . to set in motion the [National Labor Relations] Board's investigative machinery.\" <i>Flex Plastics, Inc.,</i> 262 N.L.R.B. 651, 652 (1982). In accordance with the charge's purpose of triggering an investigation that involves notice to the employer, agencies often indicate that the charge will not be kept confidential. For example, the EEOC anticipates that a charge usually will be released to the employer. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), p. 2:0001 (Aug.2002) (hereinafter EEOC Manual) (providing that correspondence may be processed as a charge if, <i>inter alia,</i> it \"does not express concerns about confidentiality\"); \u00a7 3.6, at 3:0001 (noting that \"it is EEOC policy to . . . serve the [employer] with a copy of ADEA charges unless this will impede EEOC's law enforcement functions\").</p>\n<p>The ordinary understanding of the term \"charge\" applies equally in the employment discrimination context, where a charge is a formal accusation that an employer has violated, or will violate, employment discrimination laws. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.3 (2007) (describing a charge as an allegation that an employer \"has engaged in or is about to engage in actions in violation of the Act\"). The charge is presented to the agency with jurisdiction over such matters\u0097the EEOC\u0097to trigger enforcement proceedings that are intended to eliminate violations of the ADEA. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d) (directing the agency, upon receipt of a charge, to notify the employer and take steps to eliminate the allegedly unlawful practice). I therefore agree with the EEOC that the statutory term \"charge\" must mean, at a minimum,<sup>[2]</sup> a writing that objectively indicates an intent to initiate the agency's enforcement processes. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15 (noting that a charge must \"objectively manifest an intent to make a formal accusation\" of an ADEA violation). To the extent the Court's test is subjective, see, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 1157-1158 (noting that a charge indicates that the complainant \"wants\" to activate the EEOC's processes), I disagree with the Court's formulation as inconsistent with the objective test that is the EEOC's \"considered view.\"<sup>[3]</sup> See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15. In any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1163</span> event, respondent's documents do not objectively indicate an intent to initiate the EEOC's processes; any test that construes them otherwise is, in my opinion, an unreasonable construction of the statutory term \"charge,\" and unworthy of deference. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The cumulative effect of two aspects of respondent's documents, the Court holds, illustrates that she filed a charge of discrimination: first, her request in her affidavit that the agency take action, and second, her marking of a box on the questionnaire form consenting to the release of her identity to her employer, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx). <i>Ante,</i> at 1159-1160. In my view, neither of these factors, separately or together, objectively indicates that respondent intended to initiate the EEOC's processes.</p>\n<p>The last substantive paragraph of respondent's affidavit said: \"Please force Federal Express to end their age discrimination. . . .\" App. 273. But the issue here is not whether respondent wanted the EEOC to cause the company's compliance by <i>any</i> means; it is whether she wanted the EEOC immediately to employ the particular method of enforcement that consists of filing a charge. Her request to \"force Federal Express to end their age discrimination\" could have been met by the agency's <i>beginning</i> the interviewing and counseling process that would ultimately lead to a charge. Or the agency could have proceeded to enforcement without a charge. See <i>infra,</i> at 1166. n. 5 (discussing the EEOC's authority to investigate age discrimination in the absence of any charge). Alternately, after receiving indications of repeated violations by a particular company on many intake questionnaires, the agency could have approached the company informally, effectively forcing compliance by the threat of agency litigation. See B. Lindemann &amp; D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 470 (2003) (\"The EEOC may commence litigation under the ADEA without having to first file a charge, so long as it has attempted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1164</span> conciliation\"). That sort of action would also have satisfied respondent's request. Respondent's statement to the EEOC no more constitutes expression of a present intent to file a charge than her request to a lawyer that he put an end to her employer's discrimination would constitute expression of present intent to file a complaint. The Court is simply wrong to say that a charge must merely request that the agency take \"some action,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1156-1157, or \"whatever action is necessary to vindicate her rights,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1157-1159, or unspecified \"remedial action to protect the employee's rights,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1158. To the contrary, a charge must request that the agency take <i>the particular form</i> of remedial action that results from filing a charge.</p>\n<p>Aside from revealing the ambiguity in its definition of a \"charge,\" the Court's constructions stretch the term far beyond what it can bear. A mere request for help from a complainant\u0097who, the Court acknowledges, may \"have no detailed knowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms and agency processes,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1157-1159 \u0097cannot be equated with an intent to file a charge. The Court's test permits no principled basis for distinguishing a request for the agency to take what might be described as \"pre-charge\" actions, such as interviewing and counseling, from a request for the agency to commence enforcement proceedings. All are properly considered \"agency action,\" all presumably would be part of the agency's remedial processes, and all are designed to protect the employee's rights. But a complainant's intent to trigger actions unrelated to charge-processing plainly cannot form the basis for distinguishing charges from other inquiries because it lacks any grounding in the meaning of the statutory term.</p>\n<p>Even if respondent's statement, viewed in isolation, could reasonably be understood as reflecting the requisite intent, it must be viewed in context. It is clear that respondent's filing, taken as a whole, did not amount to a request for the EEOC to commence enforcement proceedings. In fact, respondent's affidavit is replete with indications of an intent <i>not</i> to commence formal agency action. The entire first paragraph is an extensive statement that respondent had been assured her affidavit would be kept confidential, App. 266, suggesting that she did not intend the document to initiate enforcement proceedings, which would require the EEOC to notify FedEx of her allegations. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), at 2:0001 (stating that correspondence expressing concerns about confidentiality should not be treated as a charge). She identified the document as a \"complaint.\" App. 266. And although the document was notarized and respondent attested to its truthfulness, nowhere did she state that she authorized the EEOC to attempt to resolve the dispute. <i>Id.,</i> at 266-274. Finally, the affidavit was attached to the intake questionnaire, which also gave no objective indication of any intent to activate the EEOC's enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<p>As the Court concedes, the agency would not consider respondent's intake questionnaire a charge. <i>Ante,</i> at 1159-1160. Indeed, we are in agreement that the form contains numerous indicators that it will <i>not</i> be considered a charge. <i>Ibid.</i> (stating that the \"design of the form . . . does not give rise to the inference that the employee requests action against the employer,\" and \"[i]n fact the wording of the questionnaire suggests the opposite\"). The title of the form, \"Intake Questionnaire,\"<sup>[4]</sup> suggests that its purpose is preliminary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1165</span> information-gathering, not the filing of a formal charge. Likewise, the statement at the top of the form indicates that further steps are anticipated: \"Please answer the following questions, telling us briefly why you have been discriminated against in employment. An officer of the EEOC will talk with you after you complete this form.\" App. 265. The form gives the complainant the opportunity to keep her identity confidential. <i>Ibid.</i> And it contains a Privacy Act statement on the back, prominently referenced on the front of the form, which states that the information provided on the questionnaire \"will be used by Commission employees to determine the existence of facts relevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has jurisdiction over <i>potential charges,</i> complaints or allegations of employment discrimination and to provide such <i>pre-charge filing</i> counseling as is appropriate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Court apparently believes that these objective indicators are trumped by the fact that respondent marked the box authorizing the agency to disclose her identity to her employer. That portion of the form states: \"Normally, your identity will be disclosed to the organization which allegedly discriminated against you. Do you consent or not consent to such disclosure?\" <i>Ibid.</i> Since the form states it is for a narrow purpose and that identities of complainants are normally disclosed, there is no reason to view respondent's checking of the box as converting the form's stated narrow purpose to a broader one.</p>\n<p>In comparison to the intake questionnaire, the Charge of Discrimination form contains a number of objective indications that it will trigger the agency's enforcement processes. Indeed, its very title clearly indicates that it is a charge, and it contains a space for a charge number. 1 EEOC Manual Exh. 2-C, at 2:0009. Although both forms require the complainant to sign and attest that the information is correct, only the Charge of Discrimination requests an attestation that the complainant intends to initiate the agency's procedures. Just above the space for the complainant's signature, the form states \"I want this charge filed with both the EEOC and the State or local Agency, if any. I will advise the agencies if I change my address or telephone number and I will cooperate fully with them in the processing of my charge in accordance with their procedures.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The form notes \"Charging party\" at the bottom of the space for the signature. <i>Ibid.</i> And it states on the back that \"[t]he purpose of the charge, whether recorded initially on this form or in some other way reduced to writing and later recorded on this form, is to invoke the jurisdiction of the Commission.\" <i>Id.,</i> Exh. 2-C, at 2:0010. Also on the back, under \"ROUTINE USES,\" the Charge of Discrimination states that \"[i]nformation provided on this form will be used by Commission employees to guide the Commission's investigatory activities.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Although the EEOC prefers to receive a completed charge form, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18, n. 9 (noting that \"EEOC's preferred practice is indeed to receive a completed Form 5 whenever possible\"), another writing could indicate a complainant's intent to commence the EEOC's enforcement processes. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1166</span> But the form chosen by the complainant must be viewed as strong evidence of the complainant's intent, and that evidence should be deemed overcome only if the document, viewed as a whole, compels that conclusion.</p>\n<p>For the reasons I have described, respondent's intake questionnaire and attached affidavit do not objectively indicate that she intended to initiate the EEOC's enforcement processes. The Court's conclusion that the two factors \"were enough to bring the entire filing within the definition of charge,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1160, is not supported by the facts and, in my view, reveals that the Court's standard is sufficiently vacuous to permit the agency's <i>post hoc</i> interpretation of a document to control. But we cannot, under the guise of deference, sanction an agency's use of a standard that the agency has not adequately explained. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>Pearson v. Shalala,</i> 164 F.3d 650, 660-661 (C.A.D.C. 1999) (equating an agency's denial of a party's request based on the application of a vague term with simply saying \"no\" without explanation).</p>\n<p>The malleability of the Court's test is further revealed by its statement that \"[t]here might be instances where the indicated discrimination is so clear or pervasive that the agency could infer from the allegations themselves that action is requested and required.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1159. The clarity or pervasiveness of alleged discrimination is irrelevant to the employee's intent to file a charge. Although the Court states that the \"agency is not required to treat every completed Intake Questionnaire as a charge,\" <i>ibid.,</i> it apparently would permit the EEOC to do so, because under the Court's test the EEOC can infer intent from circumstances\u0097such as \"clear or pervasive\" discrimination\u0097 that have no grounding in the \"intent to act\" requirement.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Yet another indication that respondent's documents did not objectively manifest an intent to initiate the EEOC's enforcement processes is that the agency did not treat them as a charge. It did not assign a charge number, and it did not notify FedEx or commence its enforcement proceedings. This is not surprising: The EEOC accepts charges via a thorough intake process<sup>[6]</sup> in which completed intake questionnaires are not typically viewed as charges, but are used to assist the EEOC in developing the charge. A complainant visiting an EEOC office may be asked to complete an intake questionnaire. See EEOC FAQ, Answer to \"How do I file a charge of employment discrimination?\", online at https://eeoc.custhelp.com. An <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1167</span> EEOC investigator then conducts a precharge interview, 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.4, at 2:0001; 2 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1685 (4th ed.2007), covering a range of topics, including applicable laws, the complainant's allegations and other possibly discriminatory practices, confidentiality, time limits, notice requirements, and private suit rights. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a7 2.4(a)-(g), at 2:0001-2:0003. Using the information contained in the intake questionnaire and gathered during the interview, the investigator drafts the charge on a Form 5 Charge of Discrimination according to specific agency instructions, and also drafts an affidavit containing background data. See <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2.5, at 2:0003-2:0005. The investigator assigns a charge number and begins the process of serving notice on the employer and investigating the allegations. See 2 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, <i>supra,</i> at 1685-1690.</p>\n<p>Charges are thus typically completed and filed by the agency, not the complainant. See <i>Edelman v. Lynchburg College,</i> 535 U.S. 106, 115, n. 9, 122 S.Ct. 1145, 152 L.Ed.2d 188 (2002) (\"The general practice of EEOC staff members is to prepare a formal charge of discrimination for the complainant to review and to verify\" (citing Brief for United States et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 24)); EEOC FAQ, Answers to \"Where can I obtain copies of the forms to file a charge?\" (stating that the agency's policy is not to provide blank charge forms); \"How do I file a charge of employment discrimination?\" (\"When the field office has all the information it needs, you will be counseled regarding the strengths and weaknesses of a potential charge and/or you will receive a completed charge form (Form 5) for your signature\"), online at https://eeoc.custhelp.com. Once the charge is complete, the EEOC notifies the employer of the charge, usually attaching a copy of the completed charge form. 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 3.6, at 3:0001 (\"While 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.11 only requires notice to the [employer] that an ADEA charge has been filed, it is EEOC policy to also serve the [employer] with a copy of ADEA charges unless this will impede EEOC's law enforcement functions\"); Inzeo Memorandum, online at http://www.eeoc.gov/charge/ memo-8-13-07.html.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the EEOC is prepared to accept charges by other methods. If the complainant cannot or will not visit an EEOC office, an investigator may conduct the pre-charge interview and take the charge by telephone, see 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 2.4, at 2:0001, but the agency must reduce the allegations to writing before they will be considered a charge, see 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.8(b) (\"[A] charge is sufficient when the Commission receives from the person making the charge either a written statement or information reduced to writing by the Commission that conforms to the requirements of \u00a7 1626.6\"). When the EEOC receives correspondence that is a potential charge, the investigator must contact the complainant and conduct an intake interview. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.2(a), at 2:0001. Alternatively, if the correspondence \"contains all information necessary to begin investigating, constitutes a clear and timely request for EEOC to act, and does not express concerns about confidentiality or retaliation,\" then the investigator may process it as a charge without conducting an interview. See <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2.2(b), at 2:0001.</p>\n<p>Thus, while the EEOC does not typically view an intake questionnaire as a charge, I would not rule out the possibility that, in appropriate circumstances, an intake questionnaire, like other correspondence, could contain the elements necessary to constitute a charge. But an intake questionnaire\u0097even one accompanied by an affidavit\u0097 should not be construed as a charge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1168</span> unless it objectively indicates an intent to initiate the EEOC's enforcement processes. As I have explained, respondent's intake questionnaire and attached affidavit fall short of that standard. I would hold that the documents respondent filed with the EEOC were not a charge and thus did not preserve her right to sue.</p>\n<p>The implications of the Court's decision will reach far beyond respondent's case. Today's decision does nothing\u0097absolutely nothing\u0097to solve the problem that under the EEOC's current processes no one can tell, <i>ex ante,</i> whether a particular filing is or is not a charge. Given the Court's utterly vague criteria, whatever the agency later decides to regard as a charge is a charge\u0097and the statutorily required notice to the employer and conciliation process will be evaded in the future as it has been in this case. The Court's failure to apply a clear and sensible rule renders its decision of little use in future cases to complainants, employers, or the agency.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This opinion will refer to potentially-charging parties who contact the EEOC about discrimination as \"complainants.\" I use this term for simplicity and do not intend to invoke the distinction in the EEOC's regulations between complainants and charging parties. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.3 (2007). Similarly, I use \"respondent\" not as it appears in the EEOC's regulations\u0097referring to the \"prospective defendant in a charge or complaint,\" <i>ibid.</i>\u0097but as a reference to the responding parties in this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  I do not mean to foreclose the possibility that the EEOC may include additional elements in its definition, as long as they are reasonable constructions of the statutory term \"charge.\" See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 843-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p>[3]  As the EEOC acknowledges, its position on whether intent is required has varied over the years. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8, 16-17, n. 8. In 1983, the agency issued its regulations, which contain no intent requirement. Final Procedural Regulations; Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 48 Fed.Reg. 138. Five years later, it argued against an intent requirement as <i>amicus curiae</i> in <i>Steffen v. Meridian Life Ins. Co.,</i> 859 F.2d 534, 544 (C.A.7 1988) (\"The EEOC, which has appeared as amicus curiae on Steffen's behalf, has supported Steffen's contention that a completed Intake Questionnaire, in and of itself, constitutes a charge\"). In 2002, the agency issued an internal memorandum and internal guidance documents including an intent requirement. See Memorandum from Elizabeth M. Thornton, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Feb. 21, 2002), online at http://www.eeoc.gov/ charge/memo-2-21-02.html (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 22, 2008 and available in Clerk of Court's case file); 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), at 2:0001 (noting that correspondence must, <i>inter alia,</i> \"constitut[e] a clear and timely request for EEOC to act\" before it can be construed as a charge). The EEOC contradicted itself four years later, when it again took the position that there was no intent requirement in <i>Gordon v. Shafer Contracting Co.,</i> 469 F.3d 1191, 1194 (C.A.8 2006) (\"In an amicus brief, the EEOC urges us to accept such a verified Intake Questionnaire as satisfying the charge requirement\"); see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16-17, n. 8. The following year, the EEOC issued another internal memorandum and updated the Frequently Asked Questions section of its Web site, including the intent requirement in each. Memorandum from Nicholas M. Inzeo, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Field, Area, and Local Office Directors et al.

Lindemann &amp; D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 477, n. 14 (2003). Although the \"Charge Questionnaire\" form is dated \"Test 10/94,\" and is the only questionnaire form included in the Compliance Manual, it was not the form respondent used. Her intake questionnaire form was dated 1987. App. 265.</p>\n<p>[5]  Perhaps the Court's statement is intended to address the EEOC's authority to investigate alleged discrimination even in the absence of a charge. Under Title VII, these are called \"Commissioner Charges.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> 29 CFR \u00a7 1601.11(a) (2007). While the ADEA does not provide for such charges, the EEOC has independent authority to investigate age discrimination in the absence of any charge. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(a); 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.4; <i>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,</i> 500 U.S. 20, 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991); 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 8.1, at 8:0001 (June 2001). If this is what the Court means by its statement that allegations of \"clear or pervasive\" discrimination may indicate to the agency that action is \"required,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1159, then it is not clear how it is relevant to the standards at issue in this case for evaluating an individual complainant's filing.</p>\n<p>[6]  This process, in all respects relevant to this case, has been consistently used by the agency since shortly after it assumed jurisdiction over ADEA actions in 1979. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a7 2.1-2.7, at 2:0001-2:0006; 2 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1220 (3d ed.1996); B. Schlei &amp; P.

Argued November 6, 2007\u2014Decided February 27, 2008\nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) requires\n  that \u201c[n]o civil action . . . be commenced . . . until 60 days after a\n  charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the\n  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u201d (EEOC), 29 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7626(d), but does not define the term \u201ccharge.\u201d After petitioner deliv\n  ery service (FedEx) initiated programs tying its couriers\u2019 compensa\n  tion and continued employment to certain performance benchmarks,\n  respondent Kennedy (hereinafter respondent), a FedEx courier over\n  age 40, filed with the EEOC, in December 2001, a Form 283 \u201cIntake\n  Questionnaire\u201d and a detailed affidavit supporting her contention\n  that the FedEx programs discriminated against older couriers in vio\n  lation of the ADEA. In April 2002, respondent and others filed this\n  ADEA suit claiming, inter alia, that the programs were veiled at\n  tempts to force out, harass, and discriminate against older couriers.\n  FedEx moved to dismiss respondent\u2019s action, contending she had not\n  filed the \u201ccharge\u201d required by \u00a7626(d). Respondent countered that\n  her Form 283 and affidavit constituted a valid charge, but the Dis\n  trict Court disagreed and granted FedEx\u2019s motion. The Second Cir\n  cuit reversed.\nHeld:\n    1. In addition to the information required by the implementing\n regulations, i.e., an allegation of age discrimination and the name of\n the charged party, if a filing is to be deemed a \u201ccharge\u201d under the\n ADEA it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to\n take remedial action to protect the employee\u2019s rights or otherwise\n settle a dispute between the employer and the employee. Pp. 3\u201313.\n       (a) There is little dispute that the EEOC\u2019s regulations\u2014so far as\n they go\u2014are reasonable constructions of the statutory term \u201ccharge\u201d\n2              FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    and are therefore entitled to deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\n    Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013845.\n    However, while the regulations give some content to the term charge,\n    they fall short of a comprehensive definition. Thus, the issue is the\n    guidance the regulations give. Title 29 CFR \u00a71626.3 says: \u201ccharge\n    shall mean a statement filed with the [EEOC] which alleges that the\n    named prospective defendant has engaged in or is about to engage in\n    acts in violation of the Act.\u201d Section 1626.8(a) identifies information\n    a \u201ccharge should contain,\u201d including: the employee\u2019s and employer\u2019s\n    names, addresses, and phone numbers; an allegation that the em\n    ployee was the victim of age discrimination; the number of employees\n    of the charged employer; and a statement indicating whether the\n    charging party has initiated state proceedings. Section 1626.8(b),\n    however, seems to qualify these requirements by stating that a\n    charge is \u201csufficient\u201d if it meets the requirements of \u00a71626.6\u2014i.e., if it\n    is \u201cin writing and . . . name[s] the prospective respondent and . . .\n    generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s).\u201d That the meaning of\n    charge remains unclear, even with the regulations, is evidenced by\n    the differing positions of the parties and the Courts of Appeals on the\n    matter. Pp. 3\u20135.\n         (b) Just as this Court defers to reasonable statutory interpreta\n    tions, an agency is entitled to deference when it adopts a reasonable\n    interpretation of its regulations, unless its position is \u201c \u2018 plainly erro\n    neous or inconsistent with the regulation,\u2019 \u201d Auer v. Robbins, 519\n    U. S. 452, 461. The Court accords such deference to the EEOC\u2019s posi\n    tion that its regulations identify certain requirements for a charge\n    but do not provide an exhaustive definition. It follows that a docu\n    ment meeting \u00a71626.6\u2019s requirements is not a charge in every in\n    stance. The language in \u00a7\u00a71626.6 and 1626.8 cannot be viewed in iso\n    lation from the rest of the regulations. While the regulations\u2019\n    structure is less than clear, the relevant provisions are grouped un\n    der the title, \u201cProcedures\u2014Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\u201d\n    A permissible reading is that the regulations identify the procedures\n    for filing a charge but do not state the full contents of a charge.\n    Pp. 5\u20136.\n         (c) That does not resolve this case because the regulations do not\n    state what additional elements are required in a charge. The EEOC\n    submits, in accordance with a position it has adopted in internal di\n    rectives over the years, that the proper test is whether a filing, taken\n    as a whole, should be construed as a request by the employee for the\n    EEOC to take whatever action is necessary to vindicate her rights.\n    Pp. 6\u20138.\n         (d) The EEOC acted within its authority in formulating its re\n    quest-to-act requirement. The agency\u2019s policy statements, embodied\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nin its compliance manual and internal directives, interpret not only\nits regulations but also the statute itself. Assuming these interpre\ntive statements are not entitled to full Chevron deference, they never\ntheless are entitled to a \u201cmeasure of respect\u201d under the less deferen\ntial standard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, see Alaska\nDept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U. S. 461, 487,\nwhereby the Court considers whether the agency has consistently\napplied its position, e.g., United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218,\n228. Here, the relevant interpretive statement has been binding on\nEEOC staff for at least five years. True, the agency\u2019s implementation\nhas been uneven; e.g., its field office did not treat respondent\u2019s filing\nas a charge, and, as a result, she filed suit before the EEOC could ini\ntiate conciliation with FedEx. Such undoubted deficiencies are not\nenough, however, to deprive an agency that processes over 175,000\ninquiries a year of all judicial deference. Moreover, the charge must\nbe defined in a way that allows the agency to fulfill its distinct statu\ntory functions of enforcing antidiscrimination laws, see 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7626(d), and disseminating information about those laws to the pub\nlic, see, e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7\u00a7705(i), 705(g)(3). Pp. 8\u201312.\n      (e) FedEx\u2019s view that because the EEOC must act \u201c[u]pon receiv\ning . . . a charge,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(d), its failure to do so means the\nfiling is not a charge, is rejected as too artificial a reading of the\nADEA. The statute requires the aggrieved individual to file a charge\nbefore filing a lawsuit; it does not condition the individual\u2019s right to\nsue upon the agency taking any action. Cf. Edelman v. Lynchburg\nCollege, 535 U. S. 106, 112\u2013113. Moreover, because the filing of a\ncharge determines when the ADEA\u2019s time limits and procedural\nmechanisms commence, it would be illogical and impractical to make\nthe definition of charge dependent upon a condition subsequent over\nwhich the parties have no control. Cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush\nCo., 455 U. S. 422, 444. Pp. 12\u201313.\n   2. The agency\u2019s determination that respondent\u2019s December 2001 fil\ning was a charge is a reasonable exercise of its authority to apply its\nown regulations and procedures in the course of the routine admini\nstration of the statute it enforces. Pp. 13\u201317.\n      (a) Respondent\u2019s completed Form 283 contained all the informa\ntion outlined in 29 CFR \u00a71626.8, and, although the form did not itself\nrequest agency action, the accompanying affidavit asked the EEOC to\n\u201cforce [FedEx] to end [its] age discrimination plan.\u201d FedEx contends\nunpersuasively that, in context, the latter statement is ambiguous\nbecause the affidavit also stated: \u201cI have been . . . assur[ed] by [the\nEEOC] that this Affidavit will be considered confidential . . . and will\nnot be disclosed . . . unless it becomes necessary . . . to produce the af\nfidavit in a formal proceeding.\u201d This argument reads too much into\n4             FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the nondisclosure assurances. Respondent did not request the EEOC\n    to avoid contacting FedEx, but stated only her understanding that\n    the affidavit itself would be kept confidential and, even then, con\n    sented to disclosure of the affidavit in a \u201cformal proceeding.\u201d Fur\n    thermore, respondent checked a box on the Form 283 giving consent\n    for the EEOC to disclose her identity to FedEx. The fact that respon\n    dent filed a formal charge with the EEOC after she filed her District\n    Court complaint is irrelevant because postfiling conduct does not nul\n    lify an earlier, proper charge. Pp. 13\u201315.\n         (b) Because the EEOC failed to treat respondent\u2019s filing as a\n    charge in the first instance, both sides lost the benefits of the ADEA\u2019s\n    informal dispute resolution process. The court that hears the merits\n    can attempt to remedy this deficiency by staying the proceedings to\n    allow an opportunity for conciliation and settlement. While that\n    remedy is imperfect, it is unavoidable in this case. However, the ul\n    timate responsibility for establishing a clearer, more consistent proc\n    ess lies with the EEOC, which should determine, in the first instance,\n    what revisions to its forms and processes are necessary or appropri\n    ate to reduce the risk of future misunderstandings by those who seek\n    its assistance.

S. C. \u00a7621 et seq. When an employee files\n\u201ca charge alleging unlawful [age] discrimination\u201d with the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the\ncharge sets the Act\u2019s enforcement mechanisms in motion,\ncommencing a waiting period during which the employee\ncannot file suit. The phrase, \u201ca charge alleging unlawful\ndiscrimination,\u201d is used in the statute, \u00a7626(d), and\n\u201ccharge\u201d appears in the agency\u2019s implementing regula\ntions; but it has no statutory definition. In deciding what\nconstitutes a charge under the Act the Courts of Appeals\nhave adopted different definitions. As a result, difficulties\nhave arisen in determining when employees may seek\nrelief under the ADEA in courts of competent jurisdiction.\n   As a cautionary preface, we note that the EEOC en\nforcement mechanisms and statutory waiting periods for\nADEA claims differ in some respects from those pertaining\nto other statutes the EEOC enforces, such as Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42\n2         FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., and the Americans with Disabili\nties Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 327, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a712101 et seq. While there may be areas of common defi\nnition, employees and their counsel must be careful not to\napply rules applicable under one statute to a different\nstatute without careful and critical examination. Cf.\nGeneral Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S.\n581, 586\u2013587 (2004). This is so even if the EEOC forms\nand the same definition of charge apply in more than one\ntype of discrimination case.\n                              I\n   Petitioner, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx), pro\nvides mail pickup and delivery services to customers\nworldwide. In 1994 and 1995, FedEx initiated two pro\ngrams, designed, it says, to make its 45,000-strong courier\nnetwork more productive. The programs, \u201cBest Practice\nPays\u201d (BPP) and \u201cMinimum Acceptable Performance\nStandards\u201d (MAPS), tied the couriers\u2019 compensation and\ncontinued employment to certain performance bench\nmarks, for instance the number of stops a courier makes\nper day.\n   Respondents are 14 current and former FedEx couriers\nover the age of 40. They filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York on\nApril 30, 2002, claiming, inter alia, that BPP and MAPS\nviolate the ADEA. Asserting that their claims were typi\ncal of many couriers nationwide, respondents sought to\nrepresent a plaintiffs\u2019 class of all couriers over the age of\n40 who were subject to alleged acts of age discrimination\nby FedEx. The suit maintains that BPP and MAPS were\nveiled attempts to force older workers out of the company\nbefore they would be entitled to receive retirement bene\nfits. FedEx, it is alleged, used the initiatives as a pretext\nfor harassing and discriminating against older couriers in\nfavor of younger ones.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   The immediate question before us is the timeliness of\nthe suit filed by one of the plaintiffs below, Patricia Ken\nnedy, referred to here as \u201crespondent.\u201d Petitioner moved\nto dismiss respondent\u2019s action, contending respondent had\nnot filed her charge with the EEOC at least 60 days before\nfiling suit, as required by 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(d). Respondent\ncountered that she filed a valid charge on December 11,\n2001, by submitting EEOC Form 283.\n   The agency labels Form 283 an \u201cIntake Questionnaire.\u201d\nRespondent attached to the questionnaire a signed affida\nvit describing the alleged discriminatory employment\npractices in greater detail. The District Court determined\nthese documents were not a charge and granted the mo\ntion to dismiss. No. 02 Civ. 3355(LMM) (SDNY, Oct. 9,\n2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. An appeal followed, and\nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. See\n440 F. 3d 558, 570 (2006). We granted certiorari to con\nsider whether respondent\u2019s filing was a charge, 551 U. S.\n___ (2007), and we now affirm.\n                            II\n  This case presents two distinct questions: What is a\ncharge as the ADEA uses that term? And were the docu\nments respondent filed in December 2001 a charge?\n                            A\n  The relevant statutory provision states:\n      \u201cNo civil action may be commenced by an individual\n    under [the ADEA] until 60 days after a charge alleg\n    ing unlawful discrimination has been filed with the\n    Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. . . .\n\n        .           .               .             .   .\n\n    \u201cUpon receiving such a charge, the Commission shall\n    promptly notify all persons named in such charge as\n4         FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    prospective defendants in the action and shall\n    promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful prac\n    tice by informal methods of conciliation, conference,\n    and persuasion.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(d).\n   The Act does not define charge. While EEOC regula\ntions give some content to the term, they fall short of a\ncomprehensive definition. The agency has statutory au\nthority to issue regulations, see \u00a7628; and when an agency\ninvokes its authority to issue regulations, which then\ninterpret ambiguous statutory terms, the courts defer to\nits reasonable interpretations. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc.\nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,\n843\u2013845 (1984).        The regulations the agency has\nadopted\u2014so far as they go\u2014are reasonable constructions\nof the term charge. There is little dispute about this. The\nissue is the guidance the regulations give.\n   One of the regulations, 29 CFR \u00a71626.3 (2007), is enti\ntled \u201cOther definitions.\u201d It says: \u201ccharge shall mean a\nstatement filed with the Commission by or on behalf of an\naggrieved person which alleges that the named prospec\ntive defendant has engaged in or is about to engage in\nactions in violation of the Act.\u201d Section 1626.8(a) identi\nfies five pieces of information a \u201ccharge should contain\u201d:\n(1)\u2013(2) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of\nthe person making the charge and the charged entity; (3) a\nstatement of facts describing the alleged discriminatory\nact; (4) the number of employees of the charged employer;\nand (5) a statement indicating whether the charging party\nhas initiated state proceedings. The next subsection,\n\u00a71626.8(b), however, seems to qualify these requirements\nby stating that a charge is \u201csufficient\u201d if it meets the re\nquirements of \u00a71626.6\u2014i.e., if it is \u201cin writing and . . .\nname[s] the prospective respondent and . . . generally\nallege[s] the discriminatory act(s).\u201d\n   Even with the aid of the regulations the meaning of\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncharge remains unclear, as is evident from the differing\npositions of the parties now before us and in the Courts of\nAppeals. Petitioner contends an Intake Questionnaire\ncannot be a charge unless the EEOC acts upon it. On the\nother hand some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit, take a position similar to\nthe Government\u2019s in this case, that an Intake Question\nnaire can constitute a charge if it expresses the filer\u2019s\nintent to activate the EEOC\u2019s enforcement processes. See,\ne.g., Steffen v. Meridian Life Ins. Co., 859 F. 2d 534, 542\n(CA7 1988). A third view, which seems to accord with\nrespondent\u2019s position, is that all completed Intake Ques\ntionnaires are charges. See, e.g., Casavantes v. California\nState Univ., Sacramento, 732 F. 2d 1441, 1443 (CA9 1984).\n                               B\n    In support of her position that the Intake Questionnaire\nshe filed, taken together with the attached six-page affi\ndavit, meets the regulatory definition of a charge, respon\ndent places considerable emphasis on what might be\ndescribed as the regulations\u2019 catchall or savings provision,\n29 CFR \u00a71626.8(b). This seems to require only a written\ndocument with a general allegation of discriminatory\nconduct by a named employer. Respondent points out\nthat, when read together, \u00a7\u00a71626.8(b) and 1626.6 say that\na \u201ccharge is sufficient when the Commission receives . . .\na written statement\u201d that \u201cname[s] the [employer] and\n. . . generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s).\u201d Re\nspondent views this language as unequivocal and sees no\nbasis for requiring that a charge contain any additional\ninformation.\n    The EEOC\u2019s view, as expressed in the Government\u2019s\namicus brief, however, is that the regulations identify\ncertain requirements for a charge but do not provide an\nexhaustive definition. As such, not all documents that\nmeet the minimal requirements of \u00a71626.6 are charges.\n6         FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The question, then, becomes how to interpret the scope\nof the regulations. Just as we defer to an agency\u2019s reason\nable interpretations of the statute when it issues regula\ntions in the first instance, see Chevron, supra, the agency\nis entitled to further deference when it adopts a reason\nable interpretation of regulations it has put in force. See\nAuer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452 (1997). Under Auer, we\naccept the agency\u2019s position unless it is \u201c \u2018 \u201c plainly errone\nous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., at 461\n(quoting Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490\nU. S. 332, 359 (1989)).\n   In accord with this standard we accept the agency\u2019s\nposition that the regulations do not identify all necessary\ncomponents of a charge; and it follows that a document\nmeeting the requirements of \u00a71626.6 is not a charge in\nevery instance. The language in \u00a7\u00a71626.6 and 1626.8\ncannot be viewed in isolation from the rest of the regula\ntions. True, the structure of the regulations is less than\nclear. But the relevant provisions are grouped under the\ntitle, \u201cProcedures\u2014Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct.\u201d A permissible reading is that the regulations iden\ntify the procedures for filing a charge but do not state the\nfull contents a charge document must contain. This is the\nagency\u2019s position, and we defer to it under Auer.\n                             C\n  This does not resolve the case. While we agree with the\nGovernment that the regulations do not state all the\nelements a charge must contain, the question of what\nadditional elements are required remains. On this point\nthe regulations are silent.\n  The EEOC submits that the proper test for determining\nwhether a filing is a charge is whether the filing, taken as\na whole, should be construed as a request by the employee\nfor the agency to take whatever action is necessary to\nvindicate her rights.

The EEOC has adopted this position in the\nGovernment\u2019s amicus brief and in various internal direc\ntives it has issued to its field offices over the years.

(Aug. 13, 2007),\non line at http://www.eeoc.gov/charge/memo-8-13-07.html.\nThe Government asserts that this request-to-act require\nment is a reasonable extrapolation of the agency\u2019s regula\ntions and that, as a result, the agency\u2019s position is disposi\ntive under Auer.\n   The Government acknowledges the regulations do not,\non their face, speak to the filer\u2019s intent. To the extent the\nrequest-to-act requirement can be derived from the text of\nthe regulations, it must spring from the term charge. But,\nin this context, the term charge is not a construct of the\nagency\u2019s regulations. It is a term Congress used in the\nunderlying statute that has been incorporated in the\nregulations by the agency. Thus, insofar as they speak to\nthe filer\u2019s intent, the regulations do so by repeating lan\nguage from the underlying statute. It could be argued,\nthen, that this case can be distinguished from Auer. See\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 257 (2006) (the \u201cnear\nequivalence of the statute and regulation belies [the case\nfor] Auer deference\u201d); Christensen v. Harris County, 529\nU. S. 576, 588 (2000) (an agency cannot \u201cunder the guise\nof interpreting a regulation . . . create de facto a new\nregulation\u201d).\n   It is not necessary to hold that Auer deference applies to\n8         FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe agency\u2019s construction of the term charge as it is used\nin the regulations, however. For even if Auer deference is\ninapplicable, we would accept the agency\u2019s proposed con\nstruction of the statutory term, and we turn next to the\nreasons for this conclusion.\n                               D\n   In our view the agency\u2019s policy statements, embodied in\nits compliance manual and internal directives, interpret\nnot only the regulations but also the statute itself. As\nsuming these interpretive statements are not entitled to\nfull Chevron deference, they do reflect \u201c \u2018a body of experi\nence and informed judgment to which courts and litigants\nmay properly resort for guidance.\u2019 \u201d Bragdon v. Abbott, 524\nU. S. 624, 642 (1998) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134 (1944)). As such, they are entitled to a\n\u201cmeasure of respect\u201d under the less deferential Skidmore\nstandard. Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v.\nEPA, 540 U. S. 461, 487, 488 (2004); United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 227\u2013239 (2001).\n   Under Skidmore, we consider whether the agency has\napplied its position with consistency. Mead Corp., supra,\nat 228; Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U. S.\n402, 417 (1993). Here, the relevant interpretive state\nment, embodied in the compliance manual and memo\nranda, has been binding on EEOC staff for at least five\nyears. See Thornton Memo, supra. True, as the Govern\nment concedes, the agency\u2019s implementation of this policy\nhas been uneven. See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 25. In the very case before us the EEOC\u2019s Tampa\nfield office did not treat respondent\u2019s filing as a charge, as\nthe Government now maintains it should have done. And,\nas a result, respondent filed suit before the agency could\ninitiate a conciliation process with the employer.\n   These undoubted deficiencies in the agency\u2019s admini\nstration of the statute and its regulatory scheme are not\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenough, however, to deprive the agency of all judicial\ndeference. Some degree of inconsistent treatment is un\navoidable when the agency processes over 175,000 inquir\nies a year. Id., at 19, n. 10. And although one of the policy\nmemoranda the Government relies upon was circulated\nafter we granted certiorari, the position the document\ntakes is consistent with the EEOC\u2019s previous directives.\nWe see no reason to assume the agency\u2019s position\u2014that a\ncharge is filed when the employee requests some action\u2014\nwas framed for the specific purpose of aiding a party in\nthis litigation. Cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital,\n488 U. S. 204, 212\u2013213 (1988).\n   The EEOC, moreover, has drawn our attention to the\nneed to define charge in a way that allows the agency to\nfulfill its distinct statutory functions of enforcing antidis\ncrimination laws and disseminating information about\nthose laws to the public. Cf. Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S.\n212, 225 (2002) (noting that deference is appropriate in\n\u201cmatters of detail related to [an agency\u2019s] administration\u201d\nof a statute). The agency\u2019s duty to initiate informal dis\npute resolution processes upon receipt of a charge is man\ndatory in the ADEA context. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(d)\n(\u201c[T]he Commission . . . shall promptly seek to eliminate\nany alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of\nconciliation, conference, and persuasion\u201d); Cf. Lopez v.\nDavis, 531 U. S. 230, 241 (2001) (noting that Congress\u2019 use\nof the term \u201c \u2018shall\u2019 \u201d indicates an intent to \u201cimpose discre\ntionless obligations\u201d). Yet, at the same time, Congress\nintended the agency to serve an \u201ceducational\u201d function.\nSee Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7705(i), 78 Stat. 259; id.,\n\u00a7705(g)(3) (noting that the Commission shall have the\npower to \u201cfurnish to persons subject to this title such\ntechnical assistance as they may request\u201d). Providing\nanswers to the public\u2019s questions is a critical part of the\nEEOC\u2019s mission; and it accounts for a substantial part of\nthe agency\u2019s work. Of about 175,000 inquiries the agency\n10        FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreceives each year, it dockets around 76,000 of these as\ncharges. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19,\nn. 10. Even allowing for errors in the classification of\ncharges and noncharges, it is evident that many filings\ncome from individuals who have questions about their\nrights and simply want information.\n   For efficient operations, and to effect congressional\nintent, the agency requires some mechanism to separate\ninformation requests from enforcement requests. Respon\ndent\u2019s proposed standard, that a charge need contain only\nan allegation of discrimination and the name of the em\nployer, falls short in this regard. Were that stripped-down\nstandard to prevail, individuals who approach the agency\nwith questions could end up divulging enough information\nto create a charge. This likely would be the case for any\none who completes an Intake Questionnaire\u2014which pro\nvides space to indicate the name and address of the offend\ning employer and asks the individual to answer the\nquestion, \u201cWhat action was taken against you that you\nbelieve to be discrimination?\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a.\nIf an individual knows that reporting this minimal infor\nmation to the agency will mandate the agency to notify her\nemployer, she may be discouraged from consulting the\nagency or wait until her employment situation has become\nso untenable that conciliation efforts would be futile. The\nresult would be contrary to Congress\u2019 expressed desire\nthat the EEOC act as an information provider and try to\nsettle employment disputes through informal means.\n   For these reasons, the definition of charge respondent\nadvocates\u2014i.e., that it need conform only to 29 CFR\n\u00a71626.6\u2014is in considerable tension with the structure and\npurposes of the ADEA. The agency\u2019s interpretive posi\ntion\u2014the request-to-act requirement\u2014provides a reason\nable alternative that is consistent with the statutory\nframework. No clearer alternatives are within our author\nity or expertise to adopt; and so deference to the agency is\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nappropriate under Skidmore. We conclude as follows: In\naddition to the information required by the regulations,\ni.e., an allegation and the name of the charged party, if a\nfiling is to be deemed a charge it must be reasonably\nconstrued as a request for the agency to take remedial\naction to protect the employee\u2019s rights or otherwise settle\na dispute between the employer and the employee.\n   Some Courts of Appeals have referred to a \u201c \u2018manifest\nintent\u2019 \u201d test, under which, in order to be deemed a charge,\nthe filing must demonstrate \u201can individual\u2019s intent to have\nthe agency initiate its investigatory and conciliatory proc\nesses.\u201d 440 F. 3d, at 566 (case below); see also Wilkerson\nv. Grinnell Corp., 270 F. 3d 1314, 1319 (CA11 2001);\nSteffen, 859 F. 2d, at 543; Bihler v. Singer Co., 710 F. 2d\n96, 99 (CA3 1983). If this formulation suggests the filer\u2019s\nstate of mind is somehow determinative, it misses the\npoint. If, however, it means the filing must be examined\nfrom the standpoint of an objective observer to determine\nwhether, by a reasonable construction of its terms, the\nfiler requests the agency to activate its machinery and\nremedial processes, that would be in accord with our\nconclusion.\n   It is true that under this permissive standard a wide\nrange of documents might be classified as charges. But\nthis result is consistent with the design and purpose of the\nADEA. Even in the formal litigation context, pro se liti\ngants are held to a lesser pleading standard than other\nparties. See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 106 (1976)\n(Pro se pleadings are to be \u201cliberally construed\u201d). In the\nadministrative context now before us it appears pro se\nfilings may be the rule, not the exception. The ADEA, like\nTitle VII, sets up a \u201cremedial scheme in which laypersons,\nrather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process.\u201d\nEEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U. S. 107,\n124 (1988); see also Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U. S.\n750, 756 (1979) (noting the \u201ccommon purpose\u201d of Title VII\n12        FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand the ADEA). The system must be accessible to indi\nviduals who have no detailed knowledge of the relevant\nstatutory mechanisms and agency processes. It thus is\nconsistent with the purposes of the Act that a charge can\nbe a form, easy to complete, or an informal document, easy\nto draft. The agency\u2019s proposed test implements these\npurposes.\n  Reasonable arguments can be made that the agency\nshould adopt a standard giving more guidance to filers,\nmaking it clear that the request to act must be stated in\nquite explicit terms. A rule of that sort might yield more\nconsistent results. This, however, is a matter for the\nagency to decide in light of its experience and expertise in\nprotecting the rights of those who are covered by the Act.\nFor its decisions in this regard the agency is subject to the\noversight of the political branches. Cf. National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,\n545 U. S. 967, 980 (2005) (\u201cFilling these gaps [in ambigu\nous statutes] involves difficult policy choices that agencies\nare better equipped to make than courts\u201d). We find no\nreason in this case to depart from our usual rule: Where\nambiguities in statutory analysis and application are\npresented, the agency may choose among reasonable\nalternatives.\n                               E\n  Asserting its interest as an employer, petitioner urges\nus to condition the definition of charge, and hence an\nemployee\u2019s ability to sue, upon the EEOC\u2019s fulfilling its\nmandatory duty to notify the charged party and initiate a\nconciliation process. In petitioner\u2019s view, because the\nCommission must act \u201c[u]pon receiving such a charge,\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7626(d), its failure to do so means the filing is not\na charge.\n  The agency rejects this view, as do we. As a textual\nmatter, the proposal is too artificial a reading of the stat\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nute to accept. The statute requires the aggrieved individ\nual to file a charge before filing a lawsuit; it does not\ncondition the individual\u2019s right to sue upon the agency\ntaking any action. Ibid. (\u201cNo civil action may be com\nmenced by an individual under [the ADEA] until 60 days\nafter a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been\nfiled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis\nsion\u201d); Cf. Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106,\n112\u2013113 (2002) (rejecting the argument that a charge is\nnot a charge until the filer satisfies Title VII\u2019s oath or\naffirmation requirement). The filing of a charge, more\nover, determines when the Act\u2019s time limits and proce\ndural mechanisms commence. It would be illogical and\nimpractical to make the definition of charge dependent\nupon a condition subsequent over which the parties have\nno control. Cf. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U. S.\n422, 444 (1982) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).\n                             III\n  Having determined that the agency acted within its\nauthority in formulating the rule that a filing is deemed a\ncharge if the document reasonably can be construed to\nrequest agency action and appropriate relief on the em\nployee\u2019s behalf, the question is whether the filing here\nmeets this test. The agency says it does, and we agree.\nThe agency\u2019s determination is a reasonable exercise of its\nauthority to apply its own regulations and procedures in\nthe course of the routine administration of the statute it\nenforces.\n  Respondent\u2019s completed intake form contained all of the\ninformation outlined in 29 CFR \u00a71626.8, including: the\nemployee\u2019s name, address, and telephone number, as well\nas those of her employer; an allegation that she and other\nemployees had been the victims of \u201cage discrimination\u201d;\nthe number of employees who worked at the Dunedin,\nFlorida, facility where she was stationed; and a statement\n14        FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindicating she had not sought the assistance of any gov\nernment agency regarding this matter. See App. 265.\n   Petitioner maintains the filing was still deficient be\ncause it contained no request for the agency to act. Were\nthe Intake Questionnaire the only document before us we\nmight agree its handwritten statements do not request\naction. The design of the form in use in 2001, moreover,\ndoes not give rise to the inference that the employee re\nquests action against the employer. Unlike EEOC Form 5,\nthe Intake Questionnaire is not labeled a \u201cCharge of Dis\ncrimination,\u201d see id., at 275. In fact the wording of the\nquestionnaire suggests the opposite: that the form\u2019s pur\npose is to facilitate \u201cpre-charge filing counseling\u201d and to\nenable the agency to determine whether it has jurisdiction\nover \u201cpotential charges.\u201d Id., at 265. There might be\ninstances where the indicated discrimination is so clear or\npervasive that the agency could infer from the allegations\nthemselves that action is requested and required, but the\nagency is not required to treat every completed Intake\nQuestionnaire as a charge.\n   In this case, however, the completed questionnaire filed\nin December 2001 was supplemented with a detailed six-\npage affidavit. At the end of the last page, respondent\nasked the agency to \u201c[p]lease force Federal Express to end\ntheir age discrimination plan so we can finish out our\ncareers absent the unfairness and hostile work environ\nment created within their application of Best Prac\ntice/High-Velocity Culture Change.\u201d Id., at 273. This is\nproperly construed as a request for the agency to act.\n   Petitioner says that, in context, the statement is am\nbiguous. It points to respondent\u2019s accompanying state\nment that \u201cI have been given assurances by an Agent of\nthe U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nthat this Affidavit will be considered confidential by the\nUnited States Government and will not be disclosed as\nlong as the case remains open unless it becomes necessary\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor the Government to produce the affidavit in a formal\nproceeding.\u201d Id., at 266. Petitioner argues that if respon\ndent intended the affidavit to be kept confidential, she\ncould not have expected the agency to treat it as a charge.\nThis reads too much into the assurance of nondisclosure.\nRespondent did not request the agency to avoid contacting\nher employer. She stated only her understanding that the\naffidavit itself would be kept confidential. Even then, she\ngave consent for the agency to disclose the affidavit in a\n\u201cformal proceeding.\u201d Furthermore, respondent checked a\nbox on the Intake Questionnaire giving consent for the\nagency to disclose her identity to the employer. Id., at\n265. Here the combination of the waiver and respondent\u2019s\nrequest in the affidavit that the agency \u201cforce\u201d the em\nployer to stop discriminating against her were enough to\nbring the entire filing within the definition of charge we\nadopt here.\n   Petitioner notes that respondent did file a Form 5 (a\nformal charge) with the EEOC but only after she filed her\ncomplaint in the District Court. This shows, petitioner\nargues, that respondent did not intend the earlier Decem\nber 2001 filing to be a charge; otherwise, there would have\nbeen no reason for the later filing. What matters, how\never, is whether the documents filed in December 2001\nshould be interpreted as a request for the agency to act.\nPostfiling conduct does not nullify an earlier, proper\ncharge.\n   Documents filed by an employee with the EEOC should\nbe construed, to the extent consistent with permissible\nrules of interpretation, to protect the employee\u2019s rights\nand statutory remedies. Construing ambiguities against\nthe drafter may be the more efficient rule to encourage\nprecise expression in other contexts; here, however, the\nrule would undermine the remedial scheme Congress\nadopted. It would encourage individuals to avoid filing\nerrors by retaining counsel, increasing both the cost and\n16         FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nlikelihood of litigation.\n                             IV\n   The Federal Government interacts with individual\ncitizens through all but countless forms, schedules, manu\nals, and worksheets. Congress, in most cases, delegates\nthe format and design of these instruments to the agencies\nthat administer the relevant laws and processes. An\nassumption underlying the congressional decision to dele\ngate rulemaking and enforcement authority to the agency,\nand the consequent judicial rule of deference to the\nagency\u2019s determinations, is that the agency will take all\nefforts to ensure that affected parties will receive the full\nbenefits and protections of the law. Here, because the\nagency failed to treat respondent\u2019s filing as a charge in the\nfirst instance, both sides lost the benefits of the ADEA\u2019s\ninformal dispute resolution process.\n   The employer\u2019s interests, in particular, were given short\nshrift, for it was not notified of respondent\u2019s complaint\nuntil she filed suit. The court that hears the merits of this\nlitigation can attempt to remedy this deficiency by staying\nthe proceedings to allow an opportunity for conciliation\nand settlement. True, that remedy would be imperfect.\nOnce the adversary process has begun a dispute may be in\na more rigid cast than if conciliation had been attempted\nat the outset.\n   This result is unfortunate, but, at least in this case,\nunavoidable. While courts will use their powers to fashion\nthe best relief possible in situations like this one, the\nultimate responsibility for establishing a clearer, more\nconsistent process lies with the agency. The agency al\nready has made some changes to the charge-filing process.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 3, n. 2 (not\ning that the Intake Questionnaire form respondent filed\nhas been replaced with a reworded form).

The filing at\nissue in this case did not state that it was a charge and did\nnot include a charge form; to the contrary, it included a\nform that expressly stated it was for the purpose of \u201cpre\ncharge\u201d counseling. What is more, the EEOC did not\nassign it a charge number, notify the employer of the\ncomplainant\u2019s1 allegations, or commence enforcement\nproceedings.     Notwithstanding these facts, the Court\nconcludes, counterintuitively, that respondent\u2019s filing is a\ncharge because it manifests an intent for the EEOC to\ntake \u201csome action.\u201d Ante, at 9. Because the standard the\nCourt applies is broader than the ordinary meaning of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 This opinion will refer to potentially-charging parties who contact\nthe EEOC about discrimination as \u201ccomplainants.\u201d I use this term for\nsimplicity and do not intend to invoke the distinction in the EEOC\u2019s\nregulations between complainants and charging parties. See 29 CFR\n\u00a71626.3 (2007). Similarly, I use \u201crespondent\u201d not as it appears in the\nEEOC\u2019s regulations\u2014referring to the \u201cprospective defendant in a\ncharge or complaint,\u201d ibid.\u2014but as a reference to the responding\nparties in this case.\n2         FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nterm \u201ccharge,\u201d and because it is so malleable that it effec\ntively absolves the EEOC of its obligation to administer\nthe ADEA according to discernible standards, I respect\nfully dissent.\n                              I\n   As the Court notes, the ADEA directs the agency to take\ncertain actions upon receipt of a \u201ccharge\u201d but does not\ndefine that word. Ante, at 3\u20134. Because there is nothing\nto suggest that Congress used \u201ccharge\u201d as a term of art, we\nmust construe it \u201cin accordance with its ordinary or natu\nral meaning.\u201d See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476\n(1994). Dictionaries define a \u201ccharge\u201d as an accusation or\nindictment. See, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 312\n(4th ed. 2000); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic\ntionary 377 (1993). In legal parlance, a \u201ccharge\u201d is gener\nally a formal allegation of wrongdoing that initiates legal\nproceedings against an alleged wrongdoer. In criminal\nlaw, for example, a charge is defined as \u201c[a] formal accusa\ntion of an offense as a preliminary step to prosecution.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 248 (8th ed. 2004). Similarly, in\nthis context, a \u201ccharge\u201d is a formal accusation of discrimi\nnation that objectively manifests an intent to initiate\nenforcement proceedings against the employer. Just as a\ncomplaint or police report that describes the commission of\na crime is not a \u201ccharge\u201d under the criminal law, so too\nhere, a document that merely describes the alleged dis\ncrimination and requests the EEOC\u2019s assistance, but does\nnot objectively manifest an intent to initiate enforcement\nproceedings, is not a \u201ccharge\u201d within the meaning of the\nADEA.\n   This understanding of a \u201ccharge\u201d is common in adminis\ntrative law. The regulations governing allegations of\nunlawful employment practices at the Government Ac\ncountability Office, for example, define \u201ccharge\u201d as \u201cany\nrequest filed . . . to investigate any matter\u201d within the\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

L. R. B. 651, 652 (1982). In accordance with the\ncharge\u2019s purpose of triggering an investigation that in\nvolves notice to the employer, agencies often indicate that\nthe charge will not be kept confidential. For example, the\nEEOC anticipates that a charge usually will be released to\nthe employer. See, e.g., 1 EEOC Compliance Manual\n\u00a72.2(b), p. 2:0001 (Aug. 2002) (hereinafter EEOC Manual)\n(providing that correspondence may be processed as a\ncharge if, inter alia, it \u201cdoes not express concerns about\nconfidentiality\u201d); \u00a73.6, at 3:0001 (noting that \u201cit is EEOC\npolicy to . . . serve the [employer] with a copy of ADEA\ncharges unless this will impede EEOC\u2019s law enforcement\nfunctions\u201d).\n  The ordinary understanding of the term \u201ccharge\u201d applies\nequally in the employment discrimination context, where\na charge is a formal accusation that an employer has\nviolated, or will violate, employment discrimination laws.\nSee 29 CFR \u00a71626.3 (2007) (describing a charge as an\nallegation that an employer \u201chas engaged in or is about to\nengage in actions in violation of the Act\u201d). The charge is\npresented to the agency with jurisdiction over such mat\nters\u2014the EEOC\u2014to trigger enforcement proceedings that\nare intended to eliminate violations of the ADEA. See 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7626(d) (directing the agency, upon receipt of a\ncharge, to notify the employer and take steps to eliminate\nthe allegedly unlawful practice). I therefore agree with\nthe EEOC that the statutory term \u201ccharge\u201d must mean, at\na minimum,2 a writing that objectively indicates an intent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 I do not mean to foreclose the possibility that the EEOC may include\n\nadditional elements in its definition, as long as they are reasonable\nconstructions of the statutory term \u201ccharge.\u201d See Chevron U. S. A. Inc.\n4           FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nto initiate the agency\u2019s enforcement processes. See Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 15 (noting that a\ncharge must \u201cobjectively manifest an intent to make a\nformal accusation\u201d of an ADEA violation). To the extent\nthe Court\u2019s test is subjective, see, e.g., ante, at 11 (noting\nthat a charge indicates that the complainant \u201cwants\u201d to\nactivate the EEOC\u2019s processes), I disagree with the Court\u2019s\nformulation as inconsistent with the objective test that is\nthe EEOC\u2019s \u201cconsidered view.\u201d3 See Brief for United\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013845\n(1984).\n   3 As the EEOC acknowledges, its position on whether intent is\n\nrequired has varied over the years. See Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 8, 16\u201317, n. 8. In 1983, the agency issued its regula\ntions, which contain no intent requirement. Final Procedural Regula\ntions; Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 48 Fed. Reg. 138. Five\nyears later, it argued against an intent requirement as amicus curiae in\nSteffen v. Meridian Life Ins. Co., 859 F. 2d 534, 544 (CA7 1988) (\u201cThe\nEEOC, which has appeared as amicus curiae on Steffen\u2019s behalf, has\nsupported Steffen\u2019s contention that a completed Intake Questionnaire,\nin and of itself, constitutes a charge\u201d). In 2002, the agency issued an\ninternal memorandum and internal guidance documents including an\nintent requirement. See Memorandum from Elizabeth M. Thornton,\nDirector, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Area, and\nLocal Office Directors et al. (Feb. 21, 2002), online at http://www.\neeoc.gov/charge/memo-2-21-02.html (all Internet materials as visited\nFeb. 22, 2008 and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); 1 EEOC\nManual \u00a72.2(b), at 2:0001 (noting that correspondence must, inter alia,\n\u201cconstitut[e] a clear and timely request for EEOC to act\u201d before it can\nbe construed as a charge). The EEOC contradicted itself four years\nlater, when it again took the position that there was no intent require\nment in Gordon v. Shafer Contracting Co., 469 F. 3d 1191, 1194 (CA8\n2006) (\u201cIn an amicus brief, the EEOC urges us to accept such a verified\nIntake Questionnaire as satisfying the charge requirement\u201d); see also\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16\u201317, n. 8. The following\nyear, the EEOC issued another internal memorandum and updated the\nFrequently Asked Questions section of its Web site, including the intent\nrequirement in each. Memorandum from Nicholas M. Inzeo, Director,\nOffice of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Field, Area, and Local\nOffice Directors et al.

In any event, respondent\u2019s\ndocuments do not objectively indicate an intent to initiate\nthe EEOC\u2019s processes; any test that construes them oth\nerwise is, in my opinion, an unreasonable construction of\nthe statutory term \u201ccharge,\u201d and unworthy of deference.\nSee Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013845 (1984).\n                              II\n  The cumulative effect of two aspects of respondent\u2019s\ndocuments, the Court holds, illustrates that she filed a\ncharge of discrimination: first, her request in her affidavit\nthat the agency take action, and second, her marking of a\nbox on the questionnaire form consenting to the release of\nher identity to her employer, Federal Express Corporation\n(FedEx). Ante, at 14. In my view, neither of these factors,\nseparately or together, objectively indicates that respon\ndent intended to initiate the EEOC\u2019s processes.\n  The last substantive paragraph of respondent\u2019s affidavit\nsaid: \u201cPlease force Federal Express to end their age dis\ncrimination . . . .\u201d App. 273. But the issue here is not\nwhether respondent wanted the EEOC to cause the com\npany\u2019s compliance by any means; it is whether she wanted\nthe EEOC immediately to employ the particular method of\nenforcement that consists of filing a charge. Her request\nto \u201cforce Federal Express to end their age discrimination\u201d\ncould have been met by the agency\u2019s beginning the inter\nviewing and counseling process that would ultimately lead\nto a charge. Or the agency could have proceeded to en\nforcement without a charge. See infra, at 10\u201311, n. 5\n(discussing the EEOC\u2019s authority to investigate age dis\ncrimination in the absence of any charge).

HOLOWECKI\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nafter receiving indications of repeated violations by a\nparticular company on many intake questionnaires, the\nagency could have approached the company informally,\neffectively forcing compliance by the threat of agency\nlitigation. See B. Lindemann & D. Kadue, Age Discrimi\nnation in Employment Law 470 (2003) (\u201cThe EEOC may\ncommence litigation under the ADEA without having to\nfirst file a charge, so long as it has attempted concilia\ntion\u201d). That sort of action would also have satisfied re\nspondent\u2019s request. Respondent\u2019s statement to the EEOC\nno more constitutes expression of a present intent to file a\ncharge than her request to a lawyer that he put an end to\nher employer\u2019s discrimination would constitute expression\nof present intent to file a complaint. The Court is simply\nwrong to say that a charge must merely request that the\nagency take \u201csome action,\u201d ante, at 9, or \u201cwhatever action\nis necessary to vindicate her rights,\u201d ante, at 6, or unspeci\nfied \u201cremedial action to protect the employee\u2019s rights,\u201d\nante, at 11. To the contrary, a charge must request that\nthe agency take the particular form of remedial action that\nresults from filing a charge.\n   Aside from revealing the ambiguity in its definition of a\n\u201ccharge,\u201d the Court\u2019s constructions stretch the term far\nbeyond what it can bear. A mere request for help from a\ncomplainant\u2014who, the Court acknowledges, may \u201chave no\ndetailed knowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms\nand agency processes,\u201d ante, at 11\u201312\u2014cannot be equated\nwith an intent to file a charge. The Court\u2019s test permits no\nprincipled basis for distinguishing a request for the agency\nto take what might be described as \u201cpre-charge\u201d actions,\nsuch as interviewing and counseling, from a request for\nthe agency to commence enforcement proceedings. All are\nproperly considered \u201cagency action,\u201d all presumably would\nbe part of the agency\u2019s remedial processes, and all are\ndesigned to protect the employee\u2019s rights. But a com\nplainant\u2019s intent to trigger actions unrelated to charge\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)             7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprocessing plainly cannot form the basis for distinguishing\ncharges from other inquiries because it lacks any ground\ning in the meaning of the statutory term.\n   Even if respondent\u2019s statement, viewed in isolation,\ncould reasonably be understood as reflecting the requisite\nintent, it must be viewed in context. It is clear that re\nspondent\u2019s filing, taken as a whole, did not amount to a\nrequest for the EEOC to commence enforcement proceed\nings. In fact, respondent\u2019s affidavit is replete with indica\ntions of an intent not to commence formal agency action.\nThe entire first paragraph is an extensive statement that\nrespondent had been assured her affidavit would be kept\nconfidential, App. 266, suggesting that she did not intend\nthe document to initiate enforcement proceedings, which\nwould require the EEOC to notify FedEx of her allega\ntions. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a72.2(b), at 2:0001 (stating that\ncorrespondence expressing concerns about confidentiality\nshould not be treated as a charge). She identified the\ndocument as a \u201ccomplaint.\u201d App. 266. And although the\ndocument was notarized and respondent attested to its\ntruthfulness, nowhere did she state that she authorized\nthe EEOC to attempt to resolve the dispute. Id., at\n266\u2013274. Finally, the affidavit was attached to the\nintake questionnaire, which also gave no objective indica\ntion of any intent to activate the EEOC\u2019s enforcement\nproceedings.\n   As the Court concedes, the agency would not consider\nrespondent\u2019s intake questionnaire a charge. Ante, at 14.\nIndeed, we are in agreement that the form contains nu\nmerous indicators that it will not be considered a charge.\nIbid. (stating that the \u201cdesign of the form . . . does not give\nrise to the inference that the employee requests action\nagainst the employer,\u201d and \u201c[i]n fact the wording of the\nquestionnaire suggests the opposite\u201d). The title of the\n8            FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nform, \u201cIntake Questionnaire,\u201d4 suggests that its purpose is\npreliminary information-gathering, not the filing of a\nformal charge. Likewise, the statement at the top of the\nform indicates that further steps are anticipated: \u201cPlease\nanswer the following questions, telling us briefly why you\nhave been discriminated against in employment. An\nofficer of the EEOC will talk with you after you complete\nthis form.\u201d App. 265. The form gives the complainant the\nopportunity to keep her identity confidential. Ibid. And it\ncontains a Privacy Act statement on the back, prominently\nreferenced on the front of the form, which states that the\ninformation provided on the questionnaire \u201cwill be used by\nCommission employees to determine the existence of facts\nrelevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has\njurisdiction over potential charges, complaints or allega\ntions of employment discrimination and to provide such\npre-charge filing counseling as is appropriate.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   The Court apparently believes that these objective\nindicators are trumped by the fact that respondent\nmarked the box authorizing the agency to disclose her\nidentity to her employer. That portion of the form states:\n\u201cNormally, your identity will be disclosed to the organiza\ntion which allegedly discriminated against you. Do you\nconsent or not consent to such disclosure?\u201d Ibid. Since the\nform states it is for a narrow purpose and that identities of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 An\n       apparently more recent version of Form 283 is entitled \u201cCharge\nQuestionnaire,\u201d and states that, \u201c[w]hen this form constitutes the only\ntimely written statement of alleg[ed] . . . discrimination, the Commis\nsion will, consistent with 29 CFR 1601.12(b) and 29 CFR 1626.8(b),\nconsider it to be a sufficient charge of discrimination under the relevant\nstatute(s).\u201d 1 EEOC Manual, Exh. 1\u2013B, at 1:0006; see also B. Linde\nmann & D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 477, n. 14\n(2003). Although the \u201cCharge Questionnaire\u201d form is dated \u201cTest\n10/94,\u201d and is the only questionnaire form included in the Compliance\nManual, it was not the form respondent used. Her intake question\nnaire form was dated 1987. App. 265.\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

Indeed, its very title clearly indicates that it is\na charge, and it contains a space for a charge number. 1\nEEOC Manual Exh. 2\u2013C, at 2:0009. Although both forms\nrequire the complainant to sign and attest that the infor\nmation is correct, only the Charge of Discrimination re\nquests an attestation that the complainant intends to\ninitiate the agency\u2019s procedures. Just above the space for\nthe complainant\u2019s signature, the form states \u201cI want this\ncharge filed with both the EEOC and the State or local\nAgency, if any. I will advise the agencies if I change my\naddress or telephone number and I will cooperate fully\nwith them in the processing of my charge in accordance\nwith their procedures.\u201d Ibid. The form notes \u201cCharging\nparty\u201d at the bottom of the space for the signature. Ibid.\nAnd it states on the back that \u201c[t]he purpose of the charge,\nwhether recorded initially on this form or in some other\nway reduced to writing and later recorded on this form, is\nto invoke the jurisdiction of the Commission.\u201d Id., Exh. 2\u2013\nC, at 2:0010. Also on the back, under \u201cROUTINE USES,\u201d\nthe Charge of Discrimination states that \u201c[i]nformation\nprovided on this form will be used by Commission employ\nees to guide the Commission\u2019s investigatory activities.\u201d\nIbid. Although the EEOC prefers to receive a completed\ncharge form, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n18, n. 9 (noting that \u201cEEOC\u2019s preferred practice is indeed\nto receive a completed Form 5 whenever possible\u201d), an\nother writing could indicate a complainant\u2019s intent to\ncommence the EEOC\u2019s enforcement processes. But the\nform chosen by the complainant must be viewed as strong\nevidence of the complainant\u2019s intent, and that evidence\n10          FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nshould be deemed overcome only if the document, viewed\nas a whole, compels that conclusion.\n   For the reasons I have described, respondent\u2019s intake\nquestionnaire and attached affidavit do not objectively\nindicate that she intended to initiate the EEOC\u2019s enforce\nment processes. The Court\u2019s conclusion that the two\nfactors \u201cwere enough to bring the entire filing within the\ndefinition of charge,\u201d ante, at 15, is not supported by the\nfacts and, in my view, reveals that the Court\u2019s standard is\nsufficiently vacuous to permit the agency\u2019s post hoc inter\npretation of a document to control. But we cannot, under\nthe guise of deference, sanction an agency\u2019s use of a stan\ndard that the agency has not adequately explained. Cf.,\ne.g., Pearson v. Shalala, 164 F. 3d 650, 660\u2013661 (CADC\n1999) (equating an agency\u2019s denial of a party\u2019s request\nbased on the application of a vague term with simply\nsaying \u201cno\u201d without explanation).\n   The malleability of the Court\u2019s test is further revealed\nby its statement that \u201c[t]here might be instances where\nthe indicated discrimination is so clear or pervasive that\nthe agency could infer from the allegations themselves\nthat action is requested and required.\u201d Ante, at 14. The\nclarity or pervasiveness of alleged discrimination is irrele\nvant to the employee\u2019s intent to file a charge. Although\nthe Court states that the \u201cagency is not required to treat\nevery completed Intake Questionnaire as a charge,\u201d ibid.,\nit apparently would permit the EEOC to do so, because\nunder the Court\u2019s test the EEOC can infer intent from\ncircumstances\u2014such as \u201cclear or pervasive\u201d discrimina\ntion\u2014that have no grounding in the \u201cintent to act\u201d\nrequirement.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Perhaps the Court\u2019s statement is intended to address the EEOC\u2019s\n\nauthority to investigate alleged discrimination even in the absence of a\ncharge.

It did not assign a charge number, and\nit did not notify FedEx or commence its enforcement pro\nceedings. This is not surprising: The EEOC accepts\ncharges via a thorough intake process6 in which completed\nintake questionnaires are not typically viewed as charges,\nbut are used to assist the EEOC in developing the charge.\nA complainant visiting an EEOC office may be asked to\ncomplete an intake questionnaire. See EEOC FAQ, An\nswer to \u201cHow do I file a charge of employment discrimina\ntion?\u201d, online at https://eeoc.custhelp.com.

If this\nis what the Court means by its statement that allegations of \u201cclear or\npervasive\u201d discrimination may indicate to the agency that action is\n\u201crequired,\u201d ante, at 14, then it is not clear how it is relevant to the\nstandards at issue in this case for evaluating an individual complain\nant\u2019s filing.\n   6 This process, in all respects relevant to this case, has been consis\n\ntently used by the agency since shortly after it assumed jurisdiction\nover ADEA actions in 1979. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a72.1\u20132.7, at 2:0001\u2013\n2:0006; 2 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination\nLaw 1220 (3d ed. 1996); B. Schlei & P.

See id., \u00a72.5, at 2:0003\u20132:0005. The\ninvestigator assigns a charge number and begins the\nprocess of serving notice on the employer and investigat\ning the allegations. See 2 Lindemann & Grossman, supra,\nat 1685\u20131690.\n  Charges are thus typically completed and filed by the\nagency, not the complainant. See Edelman v. Lynchburg\nCollege, 535 U. S. 106, 115, n. 9 (2002) (\u201cThe general\npractice of EEOC staff members is to prepare a formal\ncharge of discrimination for the complainant to review and\nto verify\u201d (citing Brief for United States et al. as Amici\nCuriae 24)); EEOC FAQ, Answers to \u201cWhere can I obtain\ncopies of the forms to file a charge?\u201d (stating that the\nagency\u2019s policy is not to provide blank charge forms); \u201cHow\ndo I file a charge of employment discrimination?\u201d (\u201cWhen\nthe field office has all the information it needs, you will be\ncounseled regarding the strengths and weaknesses of a\npotential charge and/or you will receive a completed\ncharge form (Form 5) for your signature\u201d), online at\nhttps://eeoc.custhelp.com.

When the EEOC re\nceives correspondence that is a potential charge, the inves\ntigator must contact the complainant and conduct an\nintake interview. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a72.2(a), at 2:0001.\nAlternatively, if the correspondence \u201ccontains all informa\ntion necessary to begin investigating, constitutes a clear\nand timely request for EEOC to act, and does not express\nconcerns about confidentiality or retaliation,\u201d then the\ninvestigator may process it as a charge without conducting\nan interview. See id., \u00a72.2(b), at 2:0001.\n   Thus, while the EEOC does not typically view an intake\nquestionnaire as a charge, I would not rule out the possi\nbility that, in appropriate circumstances, an intake ques\ntionnaire, like other correspondence, could contain the\nelements necessary to constitute a charge. But an intake\nquestionnaire\u2014even one accompanied by an affidavit\u2014\nshould not be construed as a charge unless it objectively\nindicates an intent to initiate the EEOC\u2019s enforcement\nprocesses. As I have explained, respondent\u2019s intake ques\ntionnaire and attached affidavit fall short of that stan\ndard. I would hold that the documents respondent filed\nwith the EEOC were not a charge and thus did not pre\nserve her right to sue.\n   The implications of the Court\u2019s decision will reach far\nbeyond respondent\u2019s case. Today\u2019s decision does nothing\u2014\nabsolutely nothing\u2014to solve the problem that under the\nEEOC\u2019s current processes no one can tell, ex ante, whether\na particular filing is or is not a charge. Given the Court\u2019s\nutterly vague criteria, whatever the agency later decides\nto regard as a charge is a charge\u2014and the statutorily\nrequired notice to the employer and conciliation process\n14        FEDERAL EXPRESS CORP. v. HOLOWECKI\n\n                   THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwill be evaded in the future as it has been in this case.\nThe Court\u2019s failure to apply a clear and sensible rule\nrenders its decision of little use in future cases to com\nplainants, employers, or the agency.\n  For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment below.\n",

Rose, Rose &amp; Rose, P.C., Washington, D.C., for the Respondents Holowecki, et al.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case arises under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <i>et seq.</i> When an employee files \"a charge alleging unlawful [age] discrimination\" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the charge sets the Act's enforcement mechanisms in motion, commencing a waiting period during which the employee cannot file suit. The phrase, \"a charge alleging unlawful discrimination,\" is used in the statute, \u00a7 626(d), and \"charge\" appears in the agency's implementing regulations; but it has no statutory definition. In deciding what constitutes a charge under the Act the Courts of Appeals have adopted different definitions. As a result, difficulties have arisen in determining when employees <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1153</span> may seek relief under the ADEA in courts of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>As a cautionary preface, we note that the EEOC enforcement mechanisms and statutory waiting periods for ADEA claims differ in some respects from those pertaining to other statutes the EEOC enforces, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 327, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <i>et seq.</i> While there may be areas of common definition, employees and their counsel must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination. Cf. <i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131162\"><a href=\"/opinion/131162/general-dynamics-land-systems-inc-v-cline/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 586-587, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004). This is so even if the EEOC forms and the same definition of charge apply in more than one type of discrimination case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx), provides mail pickup and delivery services to customers worldwide. In 1994 and 1995, FedEx initiated two programs, designed, it says, to make its 45,000-strong courier network more productive. The programs, \"Best Practice Pays\" (BPP) and \"Minimum Acceptable Performance Standards\" (MAPS), tied the couriers' compensation and continued employment to certain performance benchmarks, for instance the number of stops a courier makes per day.</p>\n<p>Respondents are 14 current and former FedEx couriers over the age of 40. They filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 30, 2002, claiming, <i>inter alia,</i> that BPP and MAPS violate the ADEA. Asserting that their claims were typical of many couriers nationwide, respondents sought to represent a plaintiffs' class of all couriers over the age of 40 who were subject to alleged acts of age discrimination by FedEx. The suit maintains that BPP and MAPS were veiled attempts to force older workers out of the company before they would be entitled to receive retirement benefits. FedEx, it is alleged, used the initiatives as a pretext for harassing and discriminating against older couriers in favor of younger ones.</p>\n<p>The immediate question before us is the timeliness of the suit filed by one of the plaintiffs below, Patricia Kennedy, referred to here as \"respondent.\" Petitioner moved to dismiss respondent's action, contending respondent had not filed her charge with the EEOC at least 60 days before filing suit, as required by 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d). Respondent countered that she filed a valid charge on December 11, 2001, by submitting EEOC Form 283.</p>\n<p>The agency labels Form 283 an \"Intake Questionnaire.\" Respondent attached to the questionnaire a signed affidavit describing the alleged discriminatory employment practices in greater detail. The District Court determined these documents were not a charge and granted the motion to dismiss. No. 02 Civ. 3355(LMM) (SDNY, Oct. 9, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. An appeal followed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793590\"><a href=\"/opinion/793590/paul-holowecki-patricia-kennedy-donna-m-lewis-char/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, 570 (2006). We granted certiorari to consider whether respondent's filing was a charge, 551 U.S. ____, 127 S.Ct. 2914, 168 L.Ed.2d 242 (2007), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>This case presents two distinct questions: What is a charge as the ADEA uses that term? And were the documents respondent filed in December 2001 a charge?</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1154</span> A</h2>\n<p>The relevant statutory provision states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No civil action may be commenced by an individual under [the ADEA] until 60 days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Upon receiving such a charge, the Commission shall promptly notify all persons named in such charge as prospective defendants in the action and shall promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d).</blockquote>\n<p>The Act does not define charge. While EEOC regulations give some content to the term, they fall short of a comprehensive definition. The agency has statutory authority to issue regulations, see \u00a7 628; and when an agency invokes its authority to issue regulations, which then interpret ambiguous statutory terms, the courts defer to its reasonable interpretations. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The regulations the agency has adopted\u0097so far as they go\u0097are reasonable constructions of the term charge. There is little dispute about this. The issue is the guidance the regulations give.</p>\n<p>One of the regulations, 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.3 (2007), is entitled \"Other definitions.\" It says: \"<i>charge</i> shall mean a statement filed with the Commission by or on behalf of an aggrieved person which alleges that the named prospective defendant has engaged in or is about to engage in actions in violation of the Act.\" Section 1626.8(a) identifies five pieces of information a \"charge should contain\": (1)-(2) the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the person making the charge and the charged entity; (3) a statement of facts describing the alleged discriminatory act; (4) the number of employees of the charged employer; and (5) a statement indicating whether the charging party has initiated state proceedings. The next subsection, \u00a7 1626.8(b), however, seems to qualify these requirements by stating that a charge is \"sufficient\" if it meets the requirements of \u00a7 1626.6\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> if it is \"in writing and . . . name[s] the prospective respondent and . . . generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s).\"</p>\n<p>Even with the aid of the regulations the meaning of charge remains unclear, as is evident from the differing positions of the parties now before us and in the Courts of Appeals. Petitioner contends an Intake Questionnaire cannot be a charge unless the EEOC acts upon it. On the other hand some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, take a position similar to the Government's in this case, that an Intake Questionnaire can constitute a charge if it expresses the filer's intent to activate the EEOC's enforcement processes. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Steffen v. Meridian Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></span>, 542 (C.A.7 1988). A third view, which seems to accord with respondent's position, is that all completed Intake Questionnaires are charges. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Casavantes v. California State Univ., Sacramento,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434951\"><a href=\"/opinion/434951/edward-j-casavantes-deceased-leona-casavantes-as-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1441</span></a></span>, 1443 (C.A.9 1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In support of her position that the Intake Questionnaire she filed, taken together with the attached six-page affidavit, meets the regulatory definition of a charge, respondent places considerable emphasis on what might be described as the regulations' catchall or savings provision, 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.8(b). This seems to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1155</span> require only a written document with a general allegation of discriminatory conduct by a named employer. Respondent points out that, when read together, \u00a7\u00a7 1626.8(b) and 1626.6 say that a \"charge is sufficient when the Commission receives. . . a written statement\" that \"name[s] the [employer] and . . . generally allege[s] the discriminatory act(s).\" Respondent views this language as unequivocal and sees no basis for requiring that a charge contain any additional information.</p>\n<p>The EEOC's view, as expressed in the Government's <i>amicus</i> brief, however, is that the regulations identify certain requirements for a charge but do not provide an exhaustive definition. As such, not all documents that meet the minimal requirements of \u00a7 1626.6 are charges.</p>\n<p>The question, then, becomes how to interpret the scope of the regulations. Just as we defer to an agency's reasonable interpretations of the statute when it issues regulations in the first instance, see <i>Chevron, supra,</i> the agency is entitled to further deference when it adopts a reasonable interpretation of regulations it has put in force. See <i>Auer v. Robbins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118089\"><a href=\"/opinion/118089/auer-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997). Under <i>Auer,</i> we accept the agency's position unless it is \"`\"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\"'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 461, 117 S.Ct. 905 (quoting <i>Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112255\"><a href=\"/opinion/112255/robertson-v-methow-valley-citizens-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 359, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989)).</p>\n<p>In accord with this standard we accept the agency's position that the regulations do not identify all necessary components of a charge; and it follows that a document meeting the requirements of \u00a7 1626.6 is not a charge in every instance. The language in \u00a7\u00a7 1626.6 and 1626.8 cannot be viewed in isolation from the rest of the regulations. True, the structure of the regulations is less than clear. But the relevant provisions are grouped under the title, \"Procedures\u0097Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\" A permissible reading is that the regulations identify the procedures for filing a charge but do not state the full contents a charge document must contain. This is the agency's position, and we defer to it under <i>Auer.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>This does not resolve the case. While we agree with the Government that the regulations do not state all the elements a charge must contain, the question of what additional elements are required remains. On this point the regulations are silent.</p>\n<p>The EEOC submits that the proper test for determining whether a filing is a charge is whether the filing, taken as a whole, should be construed as a request by the employee for the agency to take whatever action is necessary to vindicate her rights. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15. The EEOC has adopted this position in the Government's <i>amicus</i> brief and in various internal directives it has issued to its field offices over the years. See 1 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), p. 2:0001 (Aug.2002); Memorandum from Elizabeth M. Thornton, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Feb. 21, 2002), on line at http://www.eeoc. gov/charge/memo-2-21-02.html (hereinafter Thornton Memo) (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 21, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file); Memorandum from Nicholas M. Inzeo, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Field, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Aug. 13, 2007), on line at http://www.eeoc.gov/charge/memo-8-13-07.html. The Government asserts that this request-to-act requirement is a reasonable extrapolation of the agency's regulations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1156</span> and that, as a result, the agency's position is dispositive under <i>Auer.</i></p>\n<p>The Government acknowledges the regulations do not, on their face, speak to the filer's intent. To the extent the request-to-act requirement can be derived from the text of the regulations, it must spring from the term charge. But, in this context, the term charge is not a construct of the agency's regulations. It is a term Congress used in the underlying statute that has been incorporated in the regulations by the agency. Thus, insofar as they speak to the filer's intent, the regulations do so by repeating language from the underlying statute. It could be argued, then, that this case can be distinguished from <i>Auer.</i> See <i>Gonzales v. Oregon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145693\"><a href=\"/opinion/145693/gonzales-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span>, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (the \"near equivalence of the statute and regulation belies [the case for] <i>Auer</i> deference\"); <i>Christensen v.

For even if <i>Auer</i> deference is inapplicable, we would accept the agency's proposed construction of the statutory term, and we turn next to the reasons for this conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>In our view the agency's policy statements, embodied in its compliance manual and internal directives, interpret not only the regulations but also the statute itself.

Here, the relevant interpretive statement, embodied in the compliance manual and memoranda, has been binding on EEOC staff for at least five years. See Thornton Memo, <i>supra.</i> True, as the Government concedes, the agency's implementation of this policy has been uneven. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 25. In the very case before us the EEOC's Tampa field office did not treat respondent's filing as a charge, as the Government now maintains it should have done. And, as a result, respondent filed suit before the agency could initiate a conciliation process with the employer.</p>\n<p>These undoubted deficiencies in the agency's administration of the statute and its regulatory scheme are not enough, however, to deprive the agency of all judicial deference. Some degree of inconsistent treatment is unavoidable when the agency processes over 175,000 inquiries a year. <i>Id.,</i> at 19, n. 10. And although one of the policy memoranda the Government relies upon was circulated after we granted certiorari, the position the document takes is consistent with the EEOC's previous directives. We see no reason to assume the agency's position\u0097that a charge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1157</span> is filed when the employee requests some action\u0097was framed for the specific purpose of aiding a party in this litigation. Cf. <i>Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112163\"><a href=\"/opinion/112163/bowen-v-georgetown-univ-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 212-213, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988).</p>\n<p>The EEOC, moreover, has drawn our attention to the need to define charge in a way that allows the agency to fulfill its distinct statutory functions of enforcing antidiscrimination laws and disseminating information about those laws to the public. Cf. <i>Barnhart v. Walton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118493\"><a href=\"/opinion/118493/barnhart-v-walton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 225, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002) (noting that deference is appropriate in \"matters of detail related to [an agency's] administration\" of a statute). The agency's duty to initiate informal dispute resolution processes upon receipt of a charge is mandatory in the ADEA context. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d) (\"[T]he Commission . . . shall promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practice by informal methods of conciliation, conference, and persuasion\"); Cf. <i>Lopez v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118400\"><a href=\"/opinion/118400/lopez-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span>, 241, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001) (noting that Congress' use of the term \"`shall'\" indicates an intent to \"impose discretionless obligations\"). Yet, at the same time, Congress intended the agency to serve an \"educational\" function. See Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 705(i), 78 Stat. 259; <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 705(g)(3) (noting that the Commission shall have the power to \"furnish to persons subject to this title such technical assistance as they may request\"). Providing answers to the public's questions is a critical part of the EEOC's mission; and it accounts for a substantial part of the agency's work. Of about 175,000 inquiries the agency receives each year, it dockets around 76,000 of these as charges. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 19, n. 10. Even allowing for errors in the classification of charges and noncharges, it is evident that many filings come from individuals who have questions about their rights and simply want information.</p>\n<p>For efficient operations, and to effect congressional intent, the agency requires some mechanism to separate information requests from enforcement requests. Respondent's proposed standard, that a charge need contain only an allegation of discrimination and the name of the employer, falls short in this regard. Were that stripped-down standard to prevail, individuals who approach the agency with questions could end up divulging enough information to create a charge. This likely would be the case for anyone who completes an Intake Questionnaire\u0097which provides space to indicate the name and address of the offending employer and asks the individual to answer the question, \"What action was taken against you that you believe to be discrimination?\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a. If an individual knows that reporting this minimal information to the agency will mandate the agency to notify her employer, she may be discouraged from consulting the agency or wait until her employment situation has become so untenable that conciliation efforts would be futile. The result would be contrary to Congress' expressed desire that the EEOC act as an information provider and try to settle employment disputes through informal means.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the definition of charge respondent advocates\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> that it need conform only to 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.6\u0097is in considerable tension with the structure and purposes of the ADEA. The agency's interpretive position\u0097the request-to-act requirement\u0097provides a reasonable alternative that is consistent with the statutory framework. No clearer alternatives are within our authority or expertise to adopt; and so deference to the agency is appropriate under <i>Skidmore.</i> We conclude as follows: In addition to the information required <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1158</span> by the regulations, <i>i.e.,</i> an allegation and the name of the charged party, if a filing is to be deemed a charge it must be reasonably construed as a request for the agency to take remedial action to protect the employee's rights or otherwise settle a dispute between the employer and the employee.</p>\n<p>Some Courts of Appeals have referred to a \"`manifest intent'\" test, under which, in order to be deemed a charge, the filing must demonstrate \"an individual's intent to have the agency initiate its investigatory and conciliatory processes.\" 440 F.3d, at 566 (case below); see also <i>Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75640\"><a href=\"/opinion/75640/carol-wilkerson-v-grinnell-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span>, 1319 (C.A.11 2001); <i>Steffen,</i> 859 F.2d, at 543; <i>Bihler v. Singer Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420705\"><a href=\"/opinion/420705/robert-bihler-v-the-singer-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 99 (C.A.3 1983). If this formulation suggests the filer's state of mind is somehow determinative, it misses the point. If, however, it means the filing must be examined from the standpoint of an objective observer to determine whether, by a reasonable construction of its terms, the filer requests the agency to activate its machinery and remedial processes, that would be in accord with our conclusion.</p>\n<p>It is true that under this permissive standard a wide range of documents might be classified as charges. But this result is consistent with the design and purpose of the ADEA. Even in the formal litigation context, <i>pro se</i> litigants are held to a lesser pleading standard than other parties. See <i>Estelle v. Gamble,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (<i>Pro se</i> pleadings are to be \"liberally construed\"). In the administrative context now before us it appears <i>pro se</i> filings may be the rule, not the exception. The ADEA, like Title VII, sets up a \"remedial scheme in which laypersons, rather than lawyers, are expected to initiate the process.\" <i>EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112071\"><a href=\"/opinion/112071/eeoc-v-commercial-office-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 124, 108 S.Ct. 1666, 100 L.Ed.2d 96 (1988); see also <i>Oscar Mayer &amp; Co. v. Evans,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110078\"><a href=\"/opinion/110078/oscar-mayer-co-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 756, 99 S.Ct. 2066, 60 L.Ed.2d 609 (1979) (noting the \"common purpose\" of Title VII and the ADEA). The system must be accessible to individuals who have no detailed knowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms and agency processes. It thus is consistent with the purposes of the Act that a charge can be a form, easy to complete, or an informal document, easy to draft. The agency's proposed test implements these purposes.</p>\n<p>Reasonable arguments can be made that the agency should adopt a standard giving more guidance to filers, making it clear that the request to act must be stated in quite explicit terms. A rule of that sort might yield more consistent results. This, however, is a matter for the agency to decide in light of its experience and expertise in protecting the rights of those who are covered by the Act. For its decisions in this regard the agency is subject to the oversight of the political branches. Cf. <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 980, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (\"Filling these gaps [in ambiguous statutes] involves difficult policy choices that agencies are better equipped to make than courts\"). We find no reason in this case to depart from our usual rule: Where ambiguities in statutory analysis and application are presented, the agency may choose among reasonable alternatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E</h2>\n<p>Asserting its interest as an employer, petitioner urges us to condition the definition of charge, and hence an employee's ability to sue, upon the EEOC's fulfilling its mandatory duty to notify the charged party and initiate a conciliation process. In petitioner's view, because the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1159</span> Commission must act \"[u]pon receiving such a charge,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d), its failure to do so means the filing is not a charge.</p>\n<p>The agency rejects this view, as do we. As a textual matter, the proposal is too artificial a reading of the statute to accept. The statute requires the aggrieved individual to file a charge before filing a lawsuit; it does not condition the individual's right to sue upon the agency taking any action. <i>Ibid.</i> (\"No civil action may be commenced by an individual under [the ADEA] until 60 days after a charge alleging unlawful discrimination has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\"); Cf. <i>Edelman v. Lynchburg College,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118489\"><a href=\"/opinion/118489/edelman-v-lynchburg-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 112-113, 122 S.Ct. 1145, 152 L.Ed.2d 188 (2002) (rejecting the argument that a charge is not a charge until the filer satisfies Title VII's oath or affirmation requirement). The filing of a charge, moreover, determines when the Act's time limits and procedural mechanisms commence. It would be illogical and impractical to make the definition of charge dependent upon a condition subsequent over which the parties have no control. Cf. <i>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110657\"><a href=\"/opinion/110657/logan-v-zimmerman-brush-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 444, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Having determined that the agency acted within its authority in formulating the rule that a filing is deemed a charge if the document reasonably can be construed to request agency action and appropriate relief on the employee's behalf, the question is whether the filing here meets this test. The agency says it does, and we agree. The agency's determination is a reasonable exercise of its authority to apply its own regulations and procedures in the course of the routine administration of the statute it enforces.</p>\n<p>Respondent's completed intake form contained all of the information outlined in 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.8, including: the employee's name, address, and telephone number, as well as those of her employer; an allegation that she and other employees had been the victims of \"age discrimination\"; the number of employees who worked at the Dunedin, Florida, facility where she was stationed; and a statement indicating she had not sought the assistance of any government agency regarding this matter. See App. 265.</p>\n<p>Petitioner maintains the filing was still deficient because it contained no request for the agency to act. Were the Intake Questionnaire the only document before us we might agree its handwritten statements do not request action. The design of the form in use in 2001, moreover, does not give rise to the inference that the employee requests action against the employer. Unlike EEOC Form 5, the Intake Questionnaire is not labeled a \"Charge of Discrimination,\" see <i>id.,</i> at 275. In fact the wording of the questionnaire suggests the opposite: that the form's purpose is to facilitate \"pre-charge filing counseling\" and to enable the agency to determine whether it has jurisdiction over \"potential charges.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 265. There might be instances where the indicated discrimination is so clear or pervasive that the agency could infer from the allegations themselves that action is requested and required, but the agency is not required to treat every completed Intake Questionnaire as a charge.</p>\n<p>In this case, however, the completed questionnaire filed in December 2001 was supplemented with a detailed six-page affidavit. At the end of the last page, respondent asked the agency to \"[p]lease force Federal Express to end their age discrimination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1160</span> plan so we can finish out our careers absent the unfairness and hostile work environment created within their application of <i>Best Practice/High-Velocity Culture Change.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 273. This is properly construed as a request for the agency to act.</p>\n<p>Petitioner says that, in context, the statement is ambiguous. It points to respondent's accompanying statement that \"I have been given assurances by an Agent of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that this Affidavit will be considered confidential by the United States Government and will not be disclosed as long as the case remains open unless it becomes necessary for the Government to produce the affidavit in a formal proceeding.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 266. Petitioner argues that if respondent intended the affidavit to be kept confidential, she could not have expected the agency to treat it as a charge. This reads too much into the assurance of nondisclosure. Respondent did not request the agency to avoid contacting her employer. She stated only her understanding that the affidavit itself would be kept confidential. Even then, she gave consent for the agency to disclose the affidavit in a \"formal proceeding.\" Furthermore, respondent checked a box on the Intake Questionnaire giving consent for the agency to disclose her identity to the employer. <i>Id.,</i> at 265. Here the combination of the waiver and respondent's request in the affidavit that the agency \"force\" the employer to stop discriminating against her were enough to bring the entire filing within the definition of charge we adopt here.</p>\n<p>Petitioner notes that respondent did file a Form 5 (a formal charge) with the EEOC but only after she filed her complaint in the District Court. This shows, petitioner argues, that respondent did not intend the earlier December 2001 filing to be a charge; otherwise, there would have been no reason for the later filing. What matters, however, is whether the documents filed in December 2001 should be interpreted as a request for the agency to act. Postfiling conduct does not nullify an earlier, proper charge.</p>\n<p>Documents filed by an employee with the EEOC should be construed, to the extent consistent with permissible rules of interpretation, to protect the employee's rights and statutory remedies. Construing ambiguities against the drafter may be the more efficient rule to encourage precise expression in other contexts; here, however, the rule would undermine the remedial scheme Congress adopted. It would encourage individuals to avoid filing errors by retaining counsel, increasing both the cost and likelihood of litigation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Federal Government interacts with individual citizens through all but countless forms, schedules, manuals, and worksheets. Congress, in most cases, delegates the format and design of these instruments to the agencies that administer the relevant laws and processes. An assumption underlying the congressional decision to delegate rulemaking and enforcement authority to the agency, and the consequent judicial rule of deference to the agency's determinations, is that the agency will take all efforts to ensure that affected parties will receive the full benefits and protections of the law. Here, because the agency failed to treat respondent's filing as a charge in the first instance, both sides lost the benefits of the ADEA's informal dispute resolution process.</p>\n<p>The employer's interests, in particular, were given short shrift, for it was not notified of respondent's complaint until she filed suit. The court that hears the merits of this litigation can attempt to remedy <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1161</span> this deficiency by staying the proceedings to allow an opportunity for conciliation and settlement. True, that remedy would be imperfect. Once the adversary process has begun a dispute may be in a more rigid cast than if conciliation had been attempted at the outset.</p>\n<p>This result is unfortunate, but, at least in this case, unavoidable. While courts will use their powers to fashion the best relief possible in situations like this one, the ultimate responsibility for establishing a clearer, more consistent process lies with the agency. The agency already has made some changes to the charge-filing process. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 3, n. 2 (noting that the Intake Questionnaire form respondent filed has been replaced with a reworded form). To reduce the risk of further misunderstandings by those who seek its assistance, the agency should determine, in the first instance, what additional revisions in its forms and processes are necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIA joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Today the Court decides that a \"charge\" of age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) is whatever the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) says it is. The filing at issue in this case did not state that it was a charge and did not include a charge form; to the contrary, it included a form that expressly stated it was for the purpose of \"precharge\" counseling. What is more, the EEOC did not assign it a charge number, notify the employer of the complainant's<sup>[1]</sup> allegations, or commence enforcement proceedings. Notwithstanding these facts, the Court concludes, counterintuitively, that respondent's filing is a charge because it manifests an intent for the EEOC to take \"some action.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1156-1157. Because the standard the Court applies is broader than the ordinary meaning of the term \"charge,\" and because it is so malleable that it effectively absolves the EEOC of its obligation to administer the ADEA according to discernible standards, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>As the Court notes, the ADEA directs the agency to take certain actions upon receipt of a \"charge\" but does not define that word. <i>Ante,</i> at 1153-1154. Because there is nothing to suggest that Congress used \"charge\" as a term of art, we must construe it \"in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning.\" See <i>FDIC v. Meyer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112931\"><a href=\"/opinion/112931/fdic-v-meyer/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 476, 114 S.Ct. 996, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). Dictionaries define a \"charge\" as an accusation or indictment. See, <i>e.g.,</i> American Heritage Dictionary 312 (4th ed.2000); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 377 (1993). In legal parlance, a \"charge\" is generally a formal allegation of wrongdoing that initiates legal proceedings against an alleged wrongdoer. In criminal law, for example, a charge is defined as \"[a] formal accusation of an offense as a preliminary step to prosecution.\" Black's Law Dictionary 248 (8th ed.2004). Similarly, in this context, a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1162</span> \"charge\" is a formal accusation of discrimination that objectively manifests an intent to initiate enforcement proceedings against the employer. Just as a complaint or police report that describes the commission of a crime is not a \"charge\" under the criminal law, so too here, a document that merely describes the alleged discrimination and requests the EEOC's assistance, but does not objectively manifest an intent to initiate enforcement proceedings, is not a \"charge\" within the meaning of the ADEA.</p>\n<p>This understanding of a \"charge\" is common in administrative law. The regulations governing allegations of unlawful employment practices at the Government Accountability Office, for example, define \"charge\" as \"any request filed . . . to investigate any matter\" within the jurisdiction of the agency. 4 CFR \u00a7 28.3 (2006). In actions alleging unfair labor practices, the \"purpose of the charge is . . . to set in motion the [National Labor Relations] Board's investigative machinery.\" <i>Flex Plastics, Inc.,</i> 262 N.L.R.B. 651, 652 (1982). In accordance with the charge's purpose of triggering an investigation that involves notice to the employer, agencies often indicate that the charge will not be kept confidential. For example, the EEOC anticipates that a charge usually will be released to the employer. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), p. 2:0001 (Aug.2002) (hereinafter EEOC Manual) (providing that correspondence may be processed as a charge if, <i>inter alia,</i> it \"does not express concerns about confidentiality\"); \u00a7 3.6, at 3:0001 (noting that \"it is EEOC policy to . . . serve the [employer] with a copy of ADEA charges unless this will impede EEOC's law enforcement functions\").</p>\n<p>The ordinary understanding of the term \"charge\" applies equally in the employment discrimination context, where a charge is a formal accusation that an employer has violated, or will violate, employment discrimination laws. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.3 (2007) (describing a charge as an allegation that an employer \"has engaged in or is about to engage in actions in violation of the Act\"). The charge is presented to the agency with jurisdiction over such matters\u0097the EEOC\u0097to trigger enforcement proceedings that are intended to eliminate violations of the ADEA. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d) (directing the agency, upon receipt of a charge, to notify the employer and take steps to eliminate the allegedly unlawful practice). I therefore agree with the EEOC that the statutory term \"charge\" must mean, at a minimum,<sup>[2]</sup> a writing that objectively indicates an intent to initiate the agency's enforcement processes. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15 (noting that a charge must \"objectively manifest an intent to make a formal accusation\" of an ADEA violation). To the extent the Court's test is subjective, see, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 1157-1158 (noting that a charge indicates that the complainant \"wants\" to activate the EEOC's processes), I disagree with the Court's formulation as inconsistent with the objective test that is the EEOC's \"considered view.\"<sup>[3]</sup> See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 15. In any <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1163</span> event, respondent's documents do not objectively indicate an intent to initiate the EEOC's processes; any test that construes them otherwise is, in my opinion, an unreasonable construction of the statutory term \"charge,\" and unworthy of deference. See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The cumulative effect of two aspects of respondent's documents, the Court holds, illustrates that she filed a charge of discrimination: first, her request in her affidavit that the agency take action, and second, her marking of a box on the questionnaire form consenting to the release of her identity to her employer, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx). <i>Ante,</i> at 1159-1160. In my view, neither of these factors, separately or together, objectively indicates that respondent intended to initiate the EEOC's processes.</p>\n<p>The last substantive paragraph of respondent's affidavit said: \"Please force Federal Express to end their age discrimination. . . .\" App. 273. But the issue here is not whether respondent wanted the EEOC to cause the company's compliance by <i>any</i> means; it is whether she wanted the EEOC immediately to employ the particular method of enforcement that consists of filing a charge. Her request to \"force Federal Express to end their age discrimination\" could have been met by the agency's <i>beginning</i> the interviewing and counseling process that would ultimately lead to a charge. Or the agency could have proceeded to enforcement without a charge. See <i>infra,</i> at 1166. n. 5 (discussing the EEOC's authority to investigate age discrimination in the absence of any charge). Alternately, after receiving indications of repeated violations by a particular company on many intake questionnaires, the agency could have approached the company informally, effectively forcing compliance by the threat of agency litigation. See B. Lindemann &amp; D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 470 (2003) (\"The EEOC may commence litigation under the ADEA without having to first file a charge, so long as it has attempted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1164</span> conciliation\"). That sort of action would also have satisfied respondent's request. Respondent's statement to the EEOC no more constitutes expression of a present intent to file a charge than her request to a lawyer that he put an end to her employer's discrimination would constitute expression of present intent to file a complaint. The Court is simply wrong to say that a charge must merely request that the agency take \"some action,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1156-1157, or \"whatever action is necessary to vindicate her rights,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1157-1159, or unspecified \"remedial action to protect the employee's rights,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1158. To the contrary, a charge must request that the agency take <i>the particular form</i> of remedial action that results from filing a charge.</p>\n<p>Aside from revealing the ambiguity in its definition of a \"charge,\" the Court's constructions stretch the term far beyond what it can bear. A mere request for help from a complainant\u0097who, the Court acknowledges, may \"have no detailed knowledge of the relevant statutory mechanisms and agency processes,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1157-1159 \u0097cannot be equated with an intent to file a charge. The Court's test permits no principled basis for distinguishing a request for the agency to take what might be described as \"pre-charge\" actions, such as interviewing and counseling, from a request for the agency to commence enforcement proceedings. All are properly considered \"agency action,\" all presumably would be part of the agency's remedial processes, and all are designed to protect the employee's rights. But a complainant's intent to trigger actions unrelated to charge-processing plainly cannot form the basis for distinguishing charges from other inquiries because it lacks any grounding in the meaning of the statutory term.</p>\n<p>Even if respondent's statement, viewed in isolation, could reasonably be understood as reflecting the requisite intent, it must be viewed in context. It is clear that respondent's filing, taken as a whole, did not amount to a request for the EEOC to commence enforcement proceedings. In fact, respondent's affidavit is replete with indications of an intent <i>not</i> to commence formal agency action. The entire first paragraph is an extensive statement that respondent had been assured her affidavit would be kept confidential, App. 266, suggesting that she did not intend the document to initiate enforcement proceedings, which would require the EEOC to notify FedEx of her allegations. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), at 2:0001 (stating that correspondence expressing concerns about confidentiality should not be treated as a charge). She identified the document as a \"complaint.\" App. 266. And although the document was notarized and respondent attested to its truthfulness, nowhere did she state that she authorized the EEOC to attempt to resolve the dispute. <i>Id.,</i> at 266-274. Finally, the affidavit was attached to the intake questionnaire, which also gave no objective indication of any intent to activate the EEOC's enforcement proceedings.</p>\n<p>As the Court concedes, the agency would not consider respondent's intake questionnaire a charge. <i>Ante,</i> at 1159-1160. Indeed, we are in agreement that the form contains numerous indicators that it will <i>not</i> be considered a charge. <i>Ibid.</i> (stating that the \"design of the form . . . does not give rise to the inference that the employee requests action against the employer,\" and \"[i]n fact the wording of the questionnaire suggests the opposite\"). The title of the form, \"Intake Questionnaire,\"<sup>[4]</sup> suggests that its purpose is preliminary <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1165</span> information-gathering, not the filing of a formal charge. Likewise, the statement at the top of the form indicates that further steps are anticipated: \"Please answer the following questions, telling us briefly why you have been discriminated against in employment. An officer of the EEOC will talk with you after you complete this form.\" App. 265. The form gives the complainant the opportunity to keep her identity confidential. <i>Ibid.</i> And it contains a Privacy Act statement on the back, prominently referenced on the front of the form, which states that the information provided on the questionnaire \"will be used by Commission employees to determine the existence of facts relevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has jurisdiction over <i>potential charges,</i> complaints or allegations of employment discrimination and to provide such <i>pre-charge filing</i> counseling as is appropriate.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Court apparently believes that these objective indicators are trumped by the fact that respondent marked the box authorizing the agency to disclose her identity to her employer. That portion of the form states: \"Normally, your identity will be disclosed to the organization which allegedly discriminated against you. Do you consent or not consent to such disclosure?\" <i>Ibid.</i> Since the form states it is for a narrow purpose and that identities of complainants are normally disclosed, there is no reason to view respondent's checking of the box as converting the form's stated narrow purpose to a broader one.</p>\n<p>In comparison to the intake questionnaire, the Charge of Discrimination form contains a number of objective indications that it will trigger the agency's enforcement processes. Indeed, its very title clearly indicates that it is a charge, and it contains a space for a charge number. 1 EEOC Manual Exh. 2-C, at 2:0009. Although both forms require the complainant to sign and attest that the information is correct, only the Charge of Discrimination requests an attestation that the complainant intends to initiate the agency's procedures. Just above the space for the complainant's signature, the form states \"I want this charge filed with both the EEOC and the State or local Agency, if any. I will advise the agencies if I change my address or telephone number and I will cooperate fully with them in the processing of my charge in accordance with their procedures.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The form notes \"Charging party\" at the bottom of the space for the signature. <i>Ibid.</i> And it states on the back that \"[t]he purpose of the charge, whether recorded initially on this form or in some other way reduced to writing and later recorded on this form, is to invoke the jurisdiction of the Commission.\" <i>Id.,</i> Exh. 2-C, at 2:0010. Also on the back, under \"ROUTINE USES,\" the Charge of Discrimination states that \"[i]nformation provided on this form will be used by Commission employees to guide the Commission's investigatory activities.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Although the EEOC prefers to receive a completed charge form, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 18, n. 9 (noting that \"EEOC's preferred practice is indeed to receive a completed Form 5 whenever possible\"), another writing could indicate a complainant's intent to commence the EEOC's enforcement processes. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1166</span> But the form chosen by the complainant must be viewed as strong evidence of the complainant's intent, and that evidence should be deemed overcome only if the document, viewed as a whole, compels that conclusion.</p>\n<p>For the reasons I have described, respondent's intake questionnaire and attached affidavit do not objectively indicate that she intended to initiate the EEOC's enforcement processes. The Court's conclusion that the two factors \"were enough to bring the entire filing within the definition of charge,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1160, is not supported by the facts and, in my view, reveals that the Court's standard is sufficiently vacuous to permit the agency's <i>post hoc</i> interpretation of a document to control. But we cannot, under the guise of deference, sanction an agency's use of a standard that the agency has not adequately explained. Cf., <i>e.g., </i><i>Pearson v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></span>, 660-661 (C.A.D.C. 1999) (equating an agency's denial of a party's request based on the application of a vague term with simply saying \"no\" without explanation).</p>\n<p>The malleability of the Court's test is further revealed by its statement that \"[t]here might be instances where the indicated discrimination is so clear or pervasive that the agency could infer from the allegations themselves that action is requested and required.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1159. The clarity or pervasiveness of alleged discrimination is irrelevant to the employee's intent to file a charge. Although the Court states that the \"agency is not required to treat every completed Intake Questionnaire as a charge,\" <i>ibid.,</i> it apparently would permit the EEOC to do so, because under the Court's test the EEOC can infer intent from circumstances\u0097such as \"clear or pervasive\" discrimination\u0097 that have no grounding in the \"intent to act\" requirement.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Yet another indication that respondent's documents did not objectively manifest an intent to initiate the EEOC's enforcement processes is that the agency did not treat them as a charge. It did not assign a charge number, and it did not notify FedEx or commence its enforcement proceedings. This is not surprising: The EEOC accepts charges via a thorough intake process<sup>[6]</sup> in which completed intake questionnaires are not typically viewed as charges, but are used to assist the EEOC in developing the charge. A complainant visiting an EEOC office may be asked to complete an intake questionnaire. See EEOC FAQ, Answer to \"How do I file a charge of employment discrimination?\", online at https://eeoc.custhelp.com. An <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1167</span> EEOC investigator then conducts a precharge interview, 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.4, at 2:0001; 2 B. Lindemann &amp; P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1685 (4th ed.2007), covering a range of topics, including applicable laws, the complainant's allegations and other possibly discriminatory practices, confidentiality, time limits, notice requirements, and private suit rights. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a7 2.4(a)-(g), at 2:0001-2:0003. Using the information contained in the intake questionnaire and gathered during the interview, the investigator drafts the charge on a Form 5 Charge of Discrimination according to specific agency instructions, and also drafts an affidavit containing background data. See <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2.5, at 2:0003-2:0005. The investigator assigns a charge number and begins the process of serving notice on the employer and investigating the allegations. See 2 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, <i>supra,</i> at 1685-1690.</p>\n<p>Charges are thus typically completed and filed by the agency, not the complainant. See <i>Edelman v. Lynchburg College,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118489\"><a href=\"/opinion/118489/edelman-v-lynchburg-college/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span>, 115, n. 9, 122 S.Ct. 1145, 152 L.Ed.2d 188 (2002) (\"The general practice of EEOC staff members is to prepare a formal charge of discrimination for the complainant to review and to verify\" (citing Brief for United States et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 24)); EEOC FAQ, Answers to \"Where can I obtain copies of the forms to file a charge?\" (stating that the agency's policy is not to provide blank charge forms); \"How do I file a charge of employment discrimination?\" (\"When the field office has all the information it needs, you will be counseled regarding the strengths and weaknesses of a potential charge and/or you will receive a completed charge form (Form 5) for your signature\"), online at https://eeoc.custhelp.com. Once the charge is complete, the EEOC notifies the employer of the charge, usually attaching a copy of the completed charge form. 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 3.6, at 3:0001 (\"While 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.11 only requires notice to the [employer] that an ADEA charge has been filed, it is EEOC policy to also serve the [employer] with a copy of ADEA charges unless this will impede EEOC's law enforcement functions\"); Inzeo Memorandum, online at http://www.eeoc.gov/charge/ memo-8-13-07.html.</p>\n<p>To be sure, the EEOC is prepared to accept charges by other methods. If the complainant cannot or will not visit an EEOC office, an investigator may conduct the pre-charge interview and take the charge by telephone, see 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 2.4, at 2:0001, but the agency must reduce the allegations to writing before they will be considered a charge, see 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.8(b) (\"[A] charge is sufficient when the Commission receives from the person making the charge either a written statement or information reduced to writing by the Commission that conforms to the requirements of \u00a7 1626.6\"). When the EEOC receives correspondence that is a potential charge, the investigator must contact the complainant and conduct an intake interview. See 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.2(a), at 2:0001. Alternatively, if the correspondence \"contains all information necessary to begin investigating, constitutes a clear and timely request for EEOC to act, and does not express concerns about confidentiality or retaliation,\" then the investigator may process it as a charge without conducting an interview. See <i>id.,</i> \u00a7 2.2(b), at 2:0001.</p>\n<p>Thus, while the EEOC does not typically view an intake questionnaire as a charge, I would not rule out the possibility that, in appropriate circumstances, an intake questionnaire, like other correspondence, could contain the elements necessary to constitute a charge. But an intake questionnaire\u0097even one accompanied by an affidavit\u0097 should not be construed as a charge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1168</span> unless it objectively indicates an intent to initiate the EEOC's enforcement processes. As I have explained, respondent's intake questionnaire and attached affidavit fall short of that standard. I would hold that the documents respondent filed with the EEOC were not a charge and thus did not preserve her right to sue.</p>\n<p>The implications of the Court's decision will reach far beyond respondent's case. Today's decision does nothing\u0097absolutely nothing\u0097to solve the problem that under the EEOC's current processes no one can tell, <i>ex ante,</i> whether a particular filing is or is not a charge. Given the Court's utterly vague criteria, whatever the agency later decides to regard as a charge is a charge\u0097and the statutorily required notice to the employer and conciliation process will be evaded in the future as it has been in this case. The Court's failure to apply a clear and sensible rule renders its decision of little use in future cases to complainants, employers, or the agency.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I would reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  This opinion will refer to potentially-charging parties who contact the EEOC about discrimination as \"complainants.\" I use this term for simplicity and do not intend to invoke the distinction in the EEOC's regulations between complainants and charging parties. See 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.3 (2007). Similarly, I use \"respondent\" not as it appears in the EEOC's regulations\u0097referring to the \"prospective defendant in a charge or complaint,\" <i>ibid.</i>\u0097but as a reference to the responding parties in this case.</p>\n<p>[2]  I do not mean to foreclose the possibility that the EEOC may include additional elements in its definition, as long as they are reasonable constructions of the statutory term \"charge.\" See <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-845, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p>[3]  As the EEOC acknowledges, its position on whether intent is required has varied over the years. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 8, 16-17, n. 8. In 1983, the agency issued its regulations, which contain no intent requirement. Final Procedural Regulations; Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 48 Fed.Reg. 138. Five years later, it argued against an intent requirement as <i>amicus curiae</i> in <i>Steffen v. Meridian Life Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></span>, 544 (C.A.7 1988) (\"The EEOC, which has appeared as amicus curiae on Steffen's behalf, has supported Steffen's contention that a completed Intake Questionnaire, in and of itself, constitutes a charge\"). In 2002, the agency issued an internal memorandum and internal guidance documents including an intent requirement. See Memorandum from Elizabeth M. Thornton, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Feb. 21, 2002), online at http://www.eeoc.gov/ charge/memo-2-21-02.html (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 22, 2008 and available in Clerk of Court's case file); 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 2.2(b), at 2:0001 (noting that correspondence must, <i>inter alia,</i> \"constitut[e] a clear and timely request for EEOC to act\" before it can be construed as a charge). The EEOC contradicted itself four years later, when it again took the position that there was no intent requirement in <i>Gordon v. Shafer Contracting Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796108\"><a href=\"/opinion/796108/willie-gordon-v-shafer-contracting-co-inc-equal-em/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span>, 1194 (C.A.8 2006) (\"In an amicus brief, the EEOC urges us to accept such a verified Intake Questionnaire as satisfying the charge requirement\"); see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16-17, n. 8. The following year, the EEOC issued another internal memorandum and updated the Frequently Asked Questions section of its Web site, including the intent requirement in each. Memorandum from Nicholas M. Inzeo, Director, Office of Field Programs, EEOC, to All District, Field, Area, and Local Office Directors et al. (Aug. 13, 2007) (hereinafter Inzeo Memorandum), online at http://www.eeoc.gov/ charge/memo-8-13-07.html; EEOC Frequently Asked Questions, Answer to \"How do I file a charge of employment discrimination?\" (hereinafter EEOC FAQ), online at https://eeoc.custhelp.com.</p>\n<p>[4]  An apparently more recent version of Form 283 is entitled \"Charge Questionnaire,\" and states that, \"[w]hen this form constitutes the only timely written statement of alleg[ed] . . . discrimination, the Commission will, consistent with 29 CFR 1601.12(b) and 29 CFR 1626.8(b), consider it to be a sufficient charge of discrimination under the relevant statute(s).\" 1 EEOC Manual, Exh. 1-B, at 1:0006; see also B. Lindemann &amp; D. Kadue, Age Discrimination in Employment Law 477, n. 14 (2003). Although the \"Charge Questionnaire\" form is dated \"Test 10/94,\" and is the only questionnaire form included in the Compliance Manual, it was not the form respondent used. Her intake questionnaire form was dated 1987. App. 265.</p>\n<p>[5]  Perhaps the Court's statement is intended to address the EEOC's authority to investigate alleged discrimination even in the absence of a charge. Under Title VII, these are called \"Commissioner Charges.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> 29 CFR \u00a7 1601.11(a) (2007). While the ADEA does not provide for such charges, the EEOC has independent authority to investigate age discrimination in the absence of any charge. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(a); 29 CFR \u00a7 1626.4; <i>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112584\"><a href=\"/opinion/112584/gilmer-v-interstatejohnson-lane-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 28, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991); 1 EEOC Manual \u00a7 8.1, at 8:0001 (June 2001). If this is what the Court means by its statement that allegations of \"clear or pervasive\" discrimination may indicate to the agency that action is \"required,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1159, then it is not clear how it is relevant to the standards at issue in this case for evaluating an individual complainant's filing.</p>\n<p>[6]  This process, in all respects relevant to this case, has been consistently used by the agency since shortly after it assumed jurisdiction over ADEA actions in 1979.
