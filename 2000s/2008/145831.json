Caldwell, Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP, Washington, D.C., for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We consider whether the pre-emption clause enacted in the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k, bars common-law claims challenging the safety and effectiveness of a medical device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <i>et seq.,</i> has long required FDA approval for the introduction of new drugs into the market. Until the statutory enactment at issue here, however, the introduction of new medical devices was left largely for the States to supervise as they saw fit. See <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1003</span> U.S. 470, 475-476, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996).</p>\n<p>The regulatory landscape changed in the 1960's and 1970's, as complex devices proliferated and some failed. Most notably, the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, introduced in 1970, was linked to serious infections and several deaths, not to mention a large number of pregnancies. Thousands of tort claims followed. R. Bacigal, The Limits of Litigation: The Dalkon Shield Controversy 3 (1990). In the view of many, the Dalkon Shield failure and its aftermath demonstrated the inability of the common-law tort system to manage the risks associated with dangerous devices. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. Foote, Managing the Medical Arms Race 151-152 (1992). Several States adopted regulatory measures, including California, which in 1970 enacted a law requiring premarket approval of medical devices. 1970 Cal. Stats. ch. 1573, \u00a7\u00a7 26670-26693; see also Leflar &amp; Adler, The Preemption Pentad: Federal Preemption of Products Liability Claims After Medtronic, 64 Tenn. L.Rev. 691, 703, n. 66 (1997) (identifying 13 state statutes governing medical devices as of 1976).</p>\n<p>Congress stepped in with passage of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976(MDA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c <i>et seq.,</i><sup>[1]</sup> which swept back some state obligations and imposed a regime of detailed federal oversight. The MDA includes an express pre-emption provision that states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\" \u00a7 360k(a).</blockquote>\n<p>The exception contained in subsection (b) permits the FDA to exempt some state and local requirements from pre-emption.</p>\n<p>The new regulatory regime established various levels of oversight for medical devices, depending on the risks they present. Class I, which includes such devices as elastic bandages and examination gloves, is subject to the lowest level of oversight: \"general controls,\" such as labeling requirements. \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(A); FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, http://www.fda. gov/cdrh/devadvice/3132.html (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 14, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Class II, which includes such devices as powered wheelchairs and surgical drapes, <i>ibid.,</i> is subject in addition to \"special controls\" such as performance standards and postmarket surveillance measures, \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>The devices receiving the most federal oversight are those in Class III, which include replacement heart valves, implanted cerebella stimulators, and pacemaker pulse generators, FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, <i>supra.</i> In general, a device is assigned to Class III if it cannot be established that a less stringent classification would provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and the device is \"purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health,\" or \"presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\" \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1004</span> Although the MDA established a rigorous regime of premarket approval for new Class III devices, it grandfathered many that were already on the market. Devices sold before the MDA's effective date may remain on the market until the FDA promulgates, after notice and comment, a regulation requiring premarket approval. \u00a7\u00a7 360c(f)(1), 360e(b)(1). A related provision seeks to limit the competitive advantage grandfathered devices receive. A new device need not undergo premarket approval if the FDA finds it is \"substantially equivalent\" to another device exempt from premarket approval. \u00a7 360c(f)(1)(A). The agency's review of devices for substantial equivalence is known as the \u00a7 510(k) process, named after the section of the MDA describing the review. Most new Class III devices enter the market through \u00a7 510(k). In 2005, for example, the FDA authorized the marketing of 3,148 devices under \u00a7 510(k) and granted premarket approval to just 32 devices. P. Hutt, R. Merrill, &amp; L. Grossman, Food and Drug Law 992 (3d ed.2007).</p>\n<p>Premarket approval is a \"rigorous\" process. <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 477, 116 S.Ct. 2240. A manufacturer must submit what is typically a multivolume application. FDA, Device Advice\u0097Premarket Approval (PMA) 18, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ devadvice/pma/printer.html. It includes, among other things, full reports of all studies and investigations of the device's safety and effectiveness that have been published or should reasonably be known to the applicant; a \"full statement\" of the device's \"components, ingredients, and properties and of the principle or principles of operation\"; \"a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such device\"; samples or device components required by the FDA; and a specimen of the proposed labeling. \u00a7 360e(c)(1). Before deciding whether to approve the application, the agency may refer it to a panel of outside experts, 21 CFR \u00a7 814.44(a) (2007), and may request additional data from the manufacturer, \u00a7 360e(c)(1)(G).</p>\n<p>The FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each application, <i>Lohr, supra,</i> at 477, 116 S.Ct. 2240, and grants premarket approval only if it finds there is a \"reasonable assurance\" of the device's \"safety and effectiveness,\" \u00a7 360e(d). The agency must \"weig[h] any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.\" \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(C). It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives. It approved, for example, under its Humanitarian Device Exemption procedures, a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts, even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent. FDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Summary of Safety and Probable Benefit 20 (2004), online at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/H 030003b.pdf.</p>\n<p>The premarket approval process includes review of the device's proposed labeling. The FDA evaluates safety and effectiveness under the conditions of use set forth on the label, \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(B), and must determine that the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading, \u00a7 360e(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>After completing its review, the FDA may grant or deny premarket approval. \u00a7 360e(d). It may also condition approval on adherence to performance standards, 21 CFR \u00a7 861.1(b)(3), restrictions upon sale or distribution, or compliance with other requirements, \u00a7 814.82. The agency is also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1005</span> free to impose device-specific restrictions by regulation. \u00a7 360j(e)(1).</p>\n<p>If the FDA is unable to approve a new device in its proposed form, it may send an \"approvable letter\" indicating that the device could be approved if the applicant submitted specified information or agreed to certain conditions or restrictions. 21 CFR \u00a7 814.44(e). Alternatively, the agency may send a \"not approvable\" letter, listing the grounds that justify denial and, where practical, measures that the applicant could undertake to make the device approvable. \u00a7 814.44(f).</p>\n<p>Once a device has received premarket approval, the MDA forbids the manufacturer to make, without FDA permission, changes in design specifications, manufacturing processes, labeling, or any other attribute, that would affect safety or effectiveness. \u00a7 360e(d)(6)(A)(i). If the applicant wishes to make such a change, it must submit, and the FDA must approve, an application for supplemental premarket approval, to be evaluated under largely the same criteria as an initial application. \u00a7 360e(d)(6); 21 CFR \u00a7 814.39(c).</p>\n<p>After premarket approval, the devices are subject to reporting requirements. \u00a7 360i. These include the obligation to inform the FDA of new clinical investigations or scientific studies concerning the device which the applicant knows of or reasonably should know of, 21 CFR \u00a7 814.84(b)(2), and to report incidents in which the device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if it recurred, \u00a7 803.50(a). The FDA has the power to withdraw premarket approval based on newly reported data or existing information and must withdraw approval if it determines that a device is unsafe or ineffective under the conditions in its labeling. \u00a7 360e(e)(1); see also \u00a7 360h(e) (recall authority).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Except as otherwise indicated, the facts set forth in this section appear in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. The device at issue is an Evergreen Balloon Catheter marketed by defendant-respondent Medtronic, Inc. It is a Class III device that received premarket approval from the FDA in 1994; changes to its label received supplemental approvals in 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p>Charles Riegel underwent coronary angioplasty in 1996, shortly after suffering a myocardial infarction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a. His right coronary artery was diffusely diseased and heavily calcified. Riegel's doctor inserted the Evergreen Balloon Catheter into his patient's coronary artery in an attempt to dilate the artery, although the device's labeling stated that use was contraindicated for patients with diffuse or calcified stenoses. The label also warned that the catheter should not be inflated beyond its rated burst pressure of eight atmospheres. Riegel's doctor inflated the catheter five times, to a pressure of 10 atmospheres; on its fifth inflation, the catheter ruptured. Complaint 3. Riegel developed a heart block, was placed on life support, and underwent emergency coronary bypass surgery.</p>\n<p>Riegel and his wife Donna brought this lawsuit in April 1999, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. Their complaint alleged that Medtronic's catheter was designed, labeled, and manufactured in a manner that violated New York common law, and that these defects caused Riegel to suffer severe and permanent injuries. The complaint raised a number of common-law claims. The District Court held that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1006</span> MDA pre-empted Riegel's claims of strict liability; breach of implied warranty; and negligence in the design, testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of the catheter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a; Complaint 3-4. It also held that the MDA pre-empted a negligent manufacturing claim insofar as it was not premised on the theory that Medtronic violated federal law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a. Finally, the court concluded that the MDA preempted Donna Riegel's claim for loss of consortium to the extent it was derivative of the pre-empted claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 68a; see also <i>id.,</i> at 75a.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed these dismissals. 451 F.3d 104 (2006). The court concluded that Medtronic was \"clearly subject to the federal, device-specific requirement of adhering to the standards contained in its individual, federally approved\" premarket approval application. <i>Id.,</i> at 118. The Riegels' claims were pre-empted because they \"would, if successful, impose state requirements that differed from, or added to\" the device-specific federal requirements. <i>Id.,</i> at 121. We granted certiorari.<sup>[3]</sup> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 3000, 168 L.Ed.2d 725 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Since the MDA expressly pre-empts only state requirements \"different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable ... to the device\" under federal law, \u00a7 360k(a)(1), we must determine whether the Federal Government has established requirements applicable to Medtronic's catheter. If so, we must then determine whether the Riegels' common-law claims are based upon New York requirements with respect to the device that are \"different from, or in addition to\" the federal ones, and that relate to safety and effectiveness. \u00a7 360k(a).</p>\n<p>We turn to the first question. In <i>Lohr,</i> a majority of this Court interpreted the MDA's pre-emption provision in a manner \"substantially informed\" by the FDA regulation set forth at 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d). 518 U.S., at 495, 116 S.Ct. 2240; see also <i>id.,</i> at 500-501, 116 S.Ct. 2240. That regulation says that state requirements are pre-empted \"only when the Food and Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device....\" 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d). Informed by the regulation, we concluded that federal manufacturing and labeling requirements applicable across the board to almost all medical devices did not pre-empt the common-law claims of negligence and strict liability at issue in <i>Lohr.</i> The federal requirements, we said, were not requirements specific to the device in question\u0097 they reflected \"entirely generic concerns about device regulation generally.\" 518 U.S., at 501, 116 S.Ct. 2240. While we disclaimed a conclusion that general federal requirements could never pre-empt, or general state duties never be pre-empted, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1007</span> we held that no pre-emption occurred in the case at hand based on a careful comparison between the state and federal duties at issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 500-501, 116 S.Ct. 2240.</p>\n<p>Even though substantial-equivalence review under \u00a7 510(k) is device specific, <i>Lohr</i> also rejected the manufacturer's contention that \u00a7 510(k) approval imposed device-specific \"requirements.\" We regarded the fact that products entering the market through \u00a7 510(k) may be marketed only so long as they remain substantial equivalents of the relevant pre-1976 devices as a qualification for an exemption rather than a requirement. <i>Id.,</i> at 493-494, 116 S.Ct. 2240; see also <i>id.,</i> at 513, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Premarket approval, in contrast, imposes \"requirements\" under the MDA as we interpreted it in <i>Lohr.</i> Unlike general labeling duties, premarket approval is specific to individual devices. And it is in no sense an exemption from federal safety review\u0097it <i>is</i> federal safety review. Thus, the attributes that <i>Lohr</i> found lacking in \u00a7 510(k) review are present here. While \u00a7 510(k) is \"`focused on <i>equivalence,</i> not safety,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 493, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of the Court), premarket approval is focused on safety, not equivalence. While devices that enter the market through \u00a7 510(k) have \"never been formally reviewed under the MDA for safety or efficacy,\" <i>ibid.,</i> the FDA may grant premarket approval only after it determines that a device offers a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, \u00a7 360e(d). And while the FDA does not \"`require'\" that a device allowed to enter the market as a substantial equivalent \"take any particular form for any particular reason,\" <i>ibid.,</i> at 493, 116 S.Ct. 2240, the FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its approval application, for the reason that the FDA has determined that the approved form provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn, then, to the second question: whether the Riegels' common-law claims rely upon \"any requirement\" of New York law applicable to the catheter that is \"different from, or in addition to\" federal requirements and that \"relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device.\" \u00a7 360k(a). Safety and effectiveness are the very subjects of the Riegels' common-law claims, so the critical issue is whether New York's tort duties constitute \"requirements\" under the MDA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lohr,</i> five Justices concluded that common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability do impose \"requirement[s]\" and would be pre-empted by federal requirements specific to a medical device. See 518 U.S., at 512, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 503-505, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of BREYER, J.). We adhere to that view. In interpreting two other statutes we have likewise held that a provision pre-empting state \"requirements\" pre-empted common-law duties. <i>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,</i> 544 U.S. 431, 125 S.Ct. 1788, 161 L.Ed.2d 687 (2005), found common-law actions to be pre-empted by a provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act that said certain States \"`shall not impose or continue in effect <i>any requirements</i> for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1008</span> this subchapter.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 443, 125 S.Ct. 1788 (discussing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b); emphasis added). <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 504, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992), held common-law actions pre-empted by a provision of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b), which said that \"[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\" whose packages were labeled in accordance with federal law. See 505 U.S., at 523, 112 S.Ct. 2608 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 548-549, 112 S.Ct. 2608 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Congress is entitled to know what meaning this Court will assign to terms regularly used in its enactments. Absent other indication, reference to a State's \"requirements\" includes its common-law duties. As the plurality opinion said in <i>Cipollone,</i> common-law liability is \"premised on the existence of a legal duty,\" and a tort judgment therefore establishes that the defendant has violated a state-law obligation. <i>Id.,</i> at 522, 112 S.Ct. 2608. And while the common-law remedy is limited to damages, a liability award \"`can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 521, 112 S.Ct. 2608.</p>\n<p>In the present case, there is nothing to contradict this normal meaning. To the contrary, in the context of this legislation excluding common-law duties from the scope of pre-emption would make little sense. State tort law that requires a manufacturer's catheters to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved disrupts the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect. Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less deserving of preservation. A state statute, or a regulation adopted by a state agency, could at least be expected to apply cost-benefit analysis similar to that applied by the experts at the FDA: How many more lives will be saved by a device which, along with its greater effectiveness, brings a greater risk of harm? A jury, on the other hand, sees only the cost of a more dangerous design, and is not concerned with its benefits; the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court. As Justice BREYER explained in <i>Lohr,</i> it is implausible that the MDA was meant to \"grant greater power (to set state standards `different from, or in addition to' federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials acting through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes.\" 518 U.S., at 504, 116 S.Ct. 2240. That perverse distinction is not required or even suggested by the broad language Congress chose in the MDA,<sup>[4]</sup> and we will not turn somersaults to create it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The dissent would narrow the pre-emptive scope of the term \"requirement\" on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1009</span> the grounds that it is \"difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\" for consumers injured by FDA-approved devices. <i>Post,</i> at 1015 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). But, as we have explained, this is exactly what a pre-emption clause for medical devices does by its terms. The operation of a law enacted by Congress need not be seconded by a committee report on pain of judicial nullification. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,</i> 503 U.S. 249, 253-254, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). It is not our job to speculate upon congressional motives. If we were to do so, however, the only indication available\u0097 the text of the statute\u0097suggests that the solicitude for those injured by FDA-approved devices, which the dissent finds controlling, was overcome in Congress's estimation by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case before us, the FDA has supported the position taken by our opinion with regard to the meaning of the statute. We have found it unnecessary to rely upon that agency view because we think the statute itself speaks clearly to the point at issue. If, however, we had found the statute ambiguous and had accorded the agency's current position deference, the dissent is correct, see <i>post,</i> at 1016, n. 8, that\u0097inasmuch as mere <i>Skidmore</i> deference would seemingly be at issue\u0097the degree of deference might be reduced by the fact that the agency's earlier position was different. See <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944); <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001); <i>Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala,</i> 508 U.S. 402, 417, 113 S.Ct. 2151, 124 L.Ed.2d 368 (1993). But of course the agency's earlier position (which the dissent describes at some length, <i>post,</i> at 1015-1016, and finds preferable) is even more compromised, indeed deprived of all claim to deference, by the fact that it is no longer the agency's position.</p>\n<p>The dissent also describes at great length the experience under the FDCA with respect to drugs and food and color additives. <i>Post,</i> at 1016-1018. Two points render the conclusion the dissent seeks to draw from that experience\u0097that the pre-emption clause permits tort suits\u0097 unreliable. (1) It has not been established (as the dissent assumes) that no tort lawsuits are pre-empted by drug or additive approval under the FDCA. (2) If, as the dissent believes, the pre-emption clause permits tort lawsuits for medical devices just as they are (by hypothesis) permitted for drugs and additives; and if, as the dissent believes, Congress wanted the two regimes to be alike; Congress could have applied the pre-emption clause to the entire FDCA. It did not do so, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies only to medical devices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The Riegels contend that the duties underlying negligence, strict-liability, and implied-warranty claims are not pre-empted even if they impose \"`requirements,'\" because general common-law duties are not requirements maintained \"`with respect to devices.'\" Brief for Petitioner 34-36. Again, a majority of this Court suggested otherwise in <i>Lohr.</i> See 518 U.S., at 504-505, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of BREYER, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 514, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1010</span> O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ.).<sup>[6]</sup> And with good reason. The language of the statute does not bear the Riegels' reading. The MDA provides that no State \"may establish or continue in effect <i>with respect to a device ... any requirement</i>\" relating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or in addition to, federal requirements. \u00a7 360k(a) (emphasis added). The Riegels' suit depends upon New York's \"continu[ing] in effect\" general tort duties \"with respect to\" Medtronic's catheter. Nothing in the statutory text suggests that the pre-empted state requirement must apply <i>only</i> to the relevant device, or only to medical devices and not to all products and all actions in general.</p>\n<p>The Riegels' argument to the contrary rests on the text of an FDA regulation which states that the MDA's preemption clause does not extend to certain duties, including \"[s]tate or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices (e.g., requirements such as general electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)), or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices.\" 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d)(1). Even assuming that this regulation could play a role in defining the MDA's pre-emptive scope, it does not provide unambiguous support for the Riegels' position. The agency's reading of its own rule is entitled to substantial deference, see <i>Auer v. Robbins,</i> 519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997), and the FDA's view put forward in this case is that the regulation does not refer to general tort duties of care, such as those underlying the claims in this case that a device was designed, labeled, or manufactured in an unsafe or ineffective manner. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-28. That is so, according to the FDA, because the regulation excludes from pre-emption requirements that relate only incidentally to medical devices, but not other requirements. General tort duties of care, unlike fire codes or restrictions on trade practices, \"directly regulate\" the device itself, including its design. <i>Id.,</i> at 28. We find the agency's explanation less than compelling, since the same could be said of general requirements imposed by electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code, or unfair-trade-practice law, which the regulation specifically excludes from pre-emption.</p>\n<p>Other portions of 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1, however, support the agency's view that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) has no application to this case (though still failing to explain why electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code or unfair-trade-practice requirements are different). Section 808.1(b) states that the MDA sets forth a \"general rule\" pre-empting state duties \"having the force and effect of law (whether established by statute, ordinance, regulation, <i>or court decision</i>).....\" (Emphasis added.) This sentence is far more comprehensible under the FDA's view that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) has no application here than under the Riegels' view. We are aware of no duties established by court decision other than common-law duties, and we are aware of no common-law duties that relate solely to medical devices.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1011</span> The Riegels' reading is also in tension with the regulation's statement that adulteration and misbranding claims are pre-empted when they \"ha[ve] the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device, e.g., a specific labeling requirement\" that is \"different from, or in addition to\" a federal requirement. \u00a7 808.1(d)(6)(ii). Surely this means that the MDA would pre-empt a jury determination that the FDA-approved labeling for a pacemaker violated a state common-law requirement for additional warnings. The Riegels' reading of \u00a7 808.1(d)(1), however, would allow a claim for tortious mislabeling to escape pre-emption so long as such a claim could also be brought against objects other than medical devices.</p>\n<p>All in all, we think that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) can add nothing to our analysis but confusion. Neither accepting nor rejecting the proposition that this regulation can properly be consulted to determine the statute's meaning; and neither accepting nor rejecting the FDA's distinction between general requirements that directly regulate and those that regulate only incidentally; the regulation fails to alter our interpretation of the text insofar as the outcome of this case is concerned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>State requirements are pre-empted under the MDA only to the extent that they are \"different from, or in addition to\" the requirements imposed by federal law. \u00a7 360k(a)(1). Thus, \u00a7 360k does not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations; the state duties in such a case \"parallel,\" rather than add to, federal requirements. <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 495, 116 S.Ct. 2240; see also <i>id.,</i> at 513, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The District Court in this case recognized that parallel claims would not be pre-empted, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a-71a, but it interpreted the claims here to assert that Medtronic's device violated state tort law notwithstanding compliance with the relevant federal requirements, see <i>id.,</i> at 68a. Although the Riegels now argue that their lawsuit raises parallel claims, they made no such contention in their briefs before the Second Circuit, nor did they raise this argument in their petition for certiorari. We decline to address that argument in the first instance here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The significance of the pre-emption provision in the Medical Device Amendments of 1976(MDA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k, was not fully appreciated until many years after it was enacted. It is an example of a statute whose text and general objective cover territory not actually envisioned by its authors. In such cases we have frequently concluded that \"it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> 523 U.S. 75, 79-80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998). Accordingly, while I agree with Justice GINSBURG's description of the actual history and principal purpose of the pre-emption provision at issue in this case, <i>post,</i> at 1014-1018 (dissenting opinion), I am persuaded that its text does preempt state law requirements that differ. I therefore write separately to add these few words about the MDA's history and the meaning of \"requirements.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1012</span> There is nothing in the preenactment history of the MDA suggesting that Congress thought state tort remedies had impeded the development of medical devices. Nor is there any evidence at all to suggest that Congress decided that the cost of injuries from Food and Drug Administration-approved medical devices was outweighed \"by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1009 (opinion of the Court). That is a policy argument advanced by the Court, not by Congress. As Justice GINSBURG persuasively explains, the overriding purpose of the legislation was to provide additional protection to consumers, not to withdraw existing protections. It was the then-recent development of state premarket regulatory regimes that explained the need for a provision pre-empting conflicting administrative rules. See <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 489, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\"[W]hen Congress enacted \u00a7 360k, it was primarily concerned with the problem of specific, conflicting state statutes and regulations rather than the general duties enforced by common-law actions\").</p>\n<p>But the language of the provision reaches beyond such regulatory regimes to encompass other types of \"requirements.\" Because common-law rules administered by judges, like statutes and regulations, create and define legal obligations, some of them unquestionably qualify as \"requirements.\"<sup>[1]</sup> See <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 504, 522, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (\"[C]ommon-law damages actions of the sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty, and it is difficult to say that such actions do not impose `requirements or prohibitions.'... [I]t is the essence of the common law to enforce duties that are either affirmative <i>requirements</i> or negative <i>prohibitions</i>\" (plurality opinion) (emphasis added)). And although not all common-law rules qualify as \"requirements,\"<sup>[2]</sup> the Court correctly points out that five Justices in <i>Lohr</i> concluded that the common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability at issue in that case imposed \"requirements\" that were pre-empted by federal requirements specific to a medical device. Moreover, I agree with the Court's cogent explanation of why the Riegels' claims are predicated on New York common-law duties that constitute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1013</span> requirements with respect to the device at issue that differ from federal requirements relating to safety and effectiveness. I therefore join the Court's judgment and all of its opinion except for Parts III-A and III-B.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA or Act), 90 Stat. 539, as construed by the Court, cut deeply into a domain historically occupied by state law. The MDA's preemption clause, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a), the Court holds, spares medical device manufacturers from personal injury claims alleging flaws in a design or label once the application for the design or label has gained premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); a state damages remedy, the Court instructs, persists only for claims \"premised on a violation of FDA regulations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1011.<sup>[1]</sup> I dissent from today's constriction of state authority. Congress, in my view, did not intend \u00a7 360k(a) to effect a radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices.</p>\n<p>Congress' reason for enacting \u00a7 360k(a) is evident. Until 1976, the Federal Government did not engage in premarket regulation of medical devices. Some States acted to fill the void by adopting their own regulatory systems for medical devices. Section 360k(a) responded to that state regulation, and particularly to California's system of premarket approval for medical devices, by preempting State initiatives absent FDA permission. See \u00a7 360k(b).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The \"purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone of pre-emption analysis.\" <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 504, 516, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts have \"long presumed that Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action.\" <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996).<sup>[2]</sup> Preemption analysis starts with the assumption that \"the historic police powers of the States [a]re not to be superseded ... unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\" <i>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</i> 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947). \"This assumption provides assurance that `the federal-state balance' will not be disturbed unintentionally by Congress or unnecessarily by the courts.\" <i>Jones v. Rath Packing Co.,</i> 430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 51 L.Ed.2d 604 (1977) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>The presumption against preemption is heightened \"where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation.\" <i>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,</i> 514 U.S. 645, 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995). Given the traditional \"primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety,\" <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, courts assume \"that state and local regulation related to [those] matters ... can normally coexist with federal regulations,\" <i>Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1014</span> <i>Inc.,</i> 471 U.S. 707, 718, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985).</p>\n<p>Federal laws containing a preemption clause do not automatically escape the presumption against preemption. See <i>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,</i> 544 U.S. 431, 449, 125 S.Ct. 1788, 161 L.Ed.2d 687 (2005); <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240. A preemption clause tells us that Congress intended to supersede or modify state law to some extent. In the absence of legislative precision, however, courts may face the task of determining the substance and scope of Congress' displacement of state law. Where the text of a preemption clause is open to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \"accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.\" <i>Bates,</i> 544 U.S., at 449, 125 S.Ct. 1788.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The MDA's preemption clause states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a).</blockquote>\n<p>\"Absent other indication,\" the Court states, \"reference to a State's `requirements' includes its common-law duties.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1008. Regarding the MDA, however, \"other indication\" is not \"[a]bsent.\" Contextual examination of the Act convinces me that \u00a7 360k(a)'s inclusion of the term \"requirement\" should not prompt a sweeping preemption of mine-run claims for relief under state tort law.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted the MDA \"to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use.\" 90 Stat. 539 (preamble).<sup>[4]</sup> A series of high-profile medical device failures that caused extensive injuries and loss of life propelled adoption of the MDA.<sup>[5]</sup> Conspicuous among these failures was the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, used by approximately 2.2 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1015</span> million women in the United States between 1970 and 1974. See <i>In re Northern Dist. of Cal., Dalkon Shield IUD Prods. Liability Litigation,</i> 693 F.2d 847, 848 (C.A.9 1982); <i>ante,</i> at 1002-1003. Aggressively promoted as a safe and effective form of birth control, the Dalkon Shield had been linked to 16 deaths and 25 miscarriages by the middle of 1975. H.R.Rep. No. 94-853, p. 8 (1976). By early 1976, \"more than 500 lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages totaling more than $400 million\" had been filed. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[6]</sup> Given the publicity attending the Dalkon Shield litigation and Congress' awareness of the suits at the time the MDA was under consideration, I find informative the absence of any sign of a legislative design to preempt state common-law tort actions.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court recognizes that \"\u00a7 360k does not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1011. That remedy, although important, does not help consumers injured by devices that receive FDA approval but nevertheless prove unsafe. The MDA's failure to create any federal compensatory remedy for such consumers further suggests that Congress did not intend broadly to preempt state common-law suits grounded on allegations independent of FDA requirements. It is \"difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\" for large numbers of consumers injured by defective medical devices. <i>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,</i> 464 U.S. 238, 251, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984).</p>\n<p>The former chief counsel to the FDA explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"FDA's view is that FDA product approval and state tort liability usually operate independently, each providing a significant, yet distinct, layer of consumer protection. FDA regulation of a device cannot anticipate and protect against all safety risks to individual consumers. Even the most thorough regulation of a product such as a critical medical device may fail to identify potential problems presented by the product. Regulation cannot protect against all possible injuries that might result from use of a device over time. Preemption of all such claims would result in the loss of a significant layer of consumer protection ....\" Porter, The <i>Lohr</i> Decision: FDA Perspective and Position, 52 Food &amp; Drug L.J. 7, 11 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p>Cf. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> on Pet. for Cert. in <i>Smiths Industries Medical Systems, Inc. v. Kernats,</i> O.T. 1997, No. 96-1405, pp. 17-18; Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1016</span> Service, Advisory Opinion, Docket No. 83A-0140/AP, Letter from J. Hile, Associate Comm'r for Regulatory Affairs, to National Women's Health Network (Mar. 8, 1984).<sup>[8]</sup> The Court's construction of \u00a7 360k(a) has the \"perverse effect\" of granting broad immunity \"to an entire industry that, in the judgment of Congress, needed more stringent regulation,\" <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 487, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (plurality opinion), not exemption from liability in tort litigation.</p>\n<p>The MDA does grant the FDA authority to order certain remedial action if, <i>inter alia,</i> it concludes that a device \"presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health\" and that notice of the defect \"would not by itself be sufficient to eliminate the unreasonable risk.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360h(b)(1)(A). Thus the FDA may order the manufacturer to repair the device, replace it, refund the purchase price, cease distribution, or recall the device. \u00a7 360h(b)(2), (e). The prospect of ameliorative action by the FDA, however, lends no support to the conclusion that Congress intended largely to preempt state common-law suits. Quite the opposite: Section 360h(d) states that \"[c]ompliance with an order issued under this section shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law.\" That provision anticipates \"[court-awarded] damages for economic loss\" from which the value of any FDA-ordered remedy would be subtracted. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted the MDA after decades of regulating drugs and food and color additives under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <i>et seq.</i> The FDCA contains no preemption clause, and thus the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 360k(a) has no bearing on tort suits involving drugs and additives. But \u00a7 360k(a)'s confinement to medical devices hardly renders irrelevant to the proper construction of the MDA's preemption provision the long history of federal and state controls over drugs and additives in the interest of public health and welfare. Congress' experience regulating drugs and additives informed, and in part provided the model for, its regulation of medical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1017</span> devices. I therefore turn to an examination of that experience.</p>\n<p>Starting in 1938, the FDCA required that new drugs undergo preclearance by the FDA before they could be marketed. See \u00a7 505, 52 Stat. 1052. Nothing in the FDCA's text or legislative history suggested that FDA preclearance would immunize drug manufacturers from common-law tort suits.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>By the time Congress enacted the MDA in 1976, state common-law claims for drug labeling and design defects had continued unabated despite nearly four decades of FDA regulation.<sup>[11]</sup> Congress' inclusion of a preemption clause in the MDA was not motivated by concern that similar state tort actions could be mounted regarding medical devices.<sup>[12]</sup> Rather, Congress included \u00a7 360k(a) and (b) to empower the FDA to exercise control over state premarket approval systems installed at a time when there was no preclearance at the federal level. See <i>supra,</i> at 1014, and n. 3; <i>infra,</i> at 1018, and n. 14.</p>\n<p>Between 1938 and 1976, Congress enacted a series of premarket approval requirements, first for drugs, then for additives. Premarket control, as already noted, commenced with drugs in 1938. In 1958, Congress required premarket approval for food additives. Food Additives Amendment, \u00a7 3, 72 Stat. 1785, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348. In 1960, it required premarket approval for color additives. Color Additive Amendments, \u00a7 103(b), 74 Stat. 399, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379e. In 1962, it expanded the premarket approval process for new drugs to include review for effectiveness. Drug Amendments, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1018</span> \u00a7 101, 76 Stat. 781, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 <i>et seq.</i> And in 1968, it required premarket approval for new animal drugs. Animal Drug Amendments, \u00a7 101(b), 82 Stat. 343, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b. None of these Acts contained a preemption clause.</p>\n<p>The measures just listed, like the MDA, were all enacted with common-law personal injury litigation over defective products a prominent part of the legal landscape.<sup>[13]</sup> At the time of each enactment, no state regulations required premarket approval of the drugs or additives in question, so no preemption clause was needed as a check against potentially conflicting state regulatory regimes. See Brief for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 10.</p>\n<p>A different situation existed as to medical devices when Congress developed and passed the MDA. As the House Report observed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the absence of effective Federal regulation of medical devices, some States have established their own programs. The most comprehensive State regulation of which the Committee is aware is that of California, which in 1970 adopted the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. This law requires premarket approval of all new medical devices, requires compliance of device manufacturers with good manufacturing practices and authorizes inspection of establishments which manufacture devices. Implementation of the Sherman Law has resulted in the <i>requirement</i> that intrauterine devices are subject to premarket clearance in California.\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-853, p. 45 (emphasis added).<sup>[14]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>In sum, state premarket regulation of medical devices, not any design to suppress tort suits, accounts for Congress' inclusion of a preemption clause in the MDA; no such clause figures in earlier federal laws regulating drugs and additives, for States had not installed comparable control regimes in those areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Congress' experience regulating drugs also casts doubt on Medtronic's policy arguments for reading \u00a7 360k(a) to preempt state tort claims. Section 360k(a) must preempt state common-law suits, Medtronic contends, because Congress would not have wanted state juries to second-guess the FDA's finding that a medical device is safe and effective when used as directed. Brief for Respondent 42-49. The Court is similarly minded. <i>Ante,</i> at 1008-1009.</p>\n<p>But the process for approving new drugs is at least as rigorous as the premarket approval process for medical devices.<sup>[15]</sup> Courts that have considered the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1019</span> question have overwhelmingly held that FDA approval of a new drug application does not preempt state tort suits.<sup>[16]</sup> Decades of drug regulation thus indicate, contrary to Medtronic's argument, that Congress did not regard FDA regulation and state tort claims as mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Refusing to read \u00a7 360k(a) as an automatic bar to state common-law tort claims would hardly render the FDA's premarket approval of Medtronic's medical device application irrelevant to the instant suit. First, a \"pre-emption provision, by itself, does not foreclose (through negative implication) any possibility of implied conflict preemption.\" <i>Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.,</i> 529 U.S. 861, 869, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). See also <i>Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick,</i> 514 U.S. 280, 288-289, 115 S.Ct. 1483, 131 L.Ed.2d 385 (1995). Accordingly, a medical device manufacturer may have a dispositive defense if it can identify an actual conflict <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1020</span> between the plaintiff's theory of the case and the FDA's premarket approval of the device in question. As currently postured, this case presents no occasion to take up this issue for Medtronic relies exclusively on \u00a7 360k(a) and does not argue conflict preemption.</p>\n<p>Second, a medical device manufacturer may be entitled to interpose a regulatory compliance defense based on the FDA's approval of the premarket application. Most States do not treat regulatory compliance as dispositive, but regard it as one factor to be taken into account by the jury. See Sharkey, Federalism in Action: FDA Regulatory Preemption in Pharmaceutical Cases in State Versus Federal Courts, 15 J. Law &amp; Pol'y 1013, 1024 (2007). See also Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 16(a) (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Apr. 6, 2005). In those States, a manufacturer could present the FDA's approval of its medical device as evidence that it used due care in the design and labeling of the product.</p>\n<p>The Court's broad reading of \u00a7 360k(a) saves the manufacturer from any need to urge these defenses. Instead, regardless of the strength of a plaintiff's case, suits will be barred <i>ab initio.</i> The constriction of state authority ordered today was not mandated by Congress and is at odds with the MDA's central purpose: to protect consumer safety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, I would hold that \u00a7 360k(a) does not preempt Riegel's suit. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Unqualified \u00a7 360 <i>et seq.</i> numbers hereinafter refer to sections of 21 U.S.C.</p>\n<p>[2]  The District Court later granted summary judgment to Medtronic on those claims of Riegel it had found not pre-empted, viz., that Medtronic breached an express warranty and was negligent in manufacturing because it did not comply with federal standards. App. to Pet. for Cert. 90a. It consequently granted summary judgment as well on Donna Riegel's derivative consortium claim. <i>Ibid.</i> The Court of Appeals affirmed these determinations, and they are not before us.</p>\n<p>[3]  Charles Riegel having died, Donna Riegel is now petitioner on her own behalf and as administrator of her husband's estate. 552 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 3000, 168 L.Ed.2d 725 (2007). For simplicity's sake, the terminology of our opinion draws no distinction between Charles Riegel and the Estate of Charles Riegel and refers to the claims as belonging to the Riegels.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Riegels point to \u00a7 360k(b), which authorizes the FDA to exempt state \"requirements\" from pre-emption under circumstances that would rarely be met for common-law duties. But a law that permits an agency to exempt certain \"requirements\" from pre-emption does not suggest that no other \"requirements\" exist. The Riegels also invoke \u00a7 360h(d), which provides that compliance with certain FDA orders \"shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law.\" This indicates that some state-law claims are not pre-empted, as we held in <i>Lohr.</i> But it could not possibly mean that <i>all</i> state-law claims are not pre-empted, since that would deprive the MDA pre-emption clause of all content. And it provides no guidance as to which state-law claims are pre-empted and which are not.</p>\n<p>[5]  Contrary to Justice STEVENS' contention, <i>post,</i> at 1012, we do not \"advance\" this argument. We merely suggest that if one were to speculate upon congressional purposes, the best evidence for that would be found in the statute.</p>\n<p>[6]  The opinions joined by these five Justices dispose of the Riegels' assertion that <i>Lohr</i> held common-law duties were too general to qualify as duties \"with respect to a device.\" The majority opinion in <i>Lohr</i> also disavowed this conclusion, for it stated that the Court did \"not believe that [the MDA's] statutory and regulatory language necessarily precludes ... `general' state requirements from ever being pre-empted....\" <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 U.S. 470, 500, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996).</p>\n<p>[1]  The verdicts of juries who obey those rules, however, are not \"requirements\" of that kind. Juries apply rules, but do not make them. And while a jury's finding of liability may induce a defendant to alter its device or its label, this does not render the finding a \"requirement\" within the meaning of the MDA. \"A requirement is a rule of law that must be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motivates an optional decision is not a requirement.\" <i>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,</i> 544 U.S. 431, 445, 125 S.Ct. 1788, 161 L.Ed.2d 687 (2005). It is for that reason that the MDA does not grant \"a single state jury\" any power whatsoever to set any standard that either conforms with or differs from a relevant federal standard. I do not agree with the colorful but inaccurate quotation on page 12 of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>[2]  See <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S., 504, 523, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (plurality opinion) (explaining that the fact that \"the pre-emptive scope of \u00a7 5(b) cannot be limited to positive enactments does not mean that that section pre-empts all common-law claims\" and proceeding to analyze \"each of petitioner's common-law claims to determine whether it is in fact pre-empted\"); <i>Bates,</i> 544 U.S., at 443-444, 125 S.Ct. 1788 (noting that a finding that \"\u00a7 136v(b) may pre-empt judge-made rules, as well as statutes and regulations, says nothing about the <i>scope</i> of that pre-emption,\" and proceeding to determine whether the particular common-law rules at issue in that case satisfied the conditions of pre-emption).</p>\n<p>[1]  The Court's holding does not reach an important issue outside the bounds of this case: the preemptive effect of \u00a7 360k(a) where evidence of a medical device's defect comes to light only <i>after</i> the device receives premarket approval.</p>\n<p>[2]  In part, <i>Lohr</i> spoke for the Court, and in part, for a plurality. Unless otherwise indicated, citations in this opinion refer to portions of <i>Lohr</i> conveying the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>[3]  The very next provision, \u00a7 360k(b), allows States and their political subdivisions to apply for exemption from the requirements for medical devices set by the FDA when their own requirements are \"more stringent\" than federal standards or are necessitated by \"compelling local conditions.\" This prescription indicates solicitude for state concerns, as embodied in legislation or regulation. But no more than \u00a7 360k(a) itself does \u00a7 360k(b) show that Congress homed in on state common-law suits and meant to deny injured parties recourse to them.</p>\n<p>[4]  Introducing the bill in the Senate, its sponsor explained: \"The legislation is written so that the benefit of the doubt is always given to the consumer.

L.Rev. 895, 925 (1994) (\"To the extent that Congress mentioned common law tort claims, it was not to criticize them or to suggest that they needed to be barred once a federal regulation was in place. Rather, it was to note how they demonstrated that <i>additional</i> protections for consumers were needed.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  The FDA recently announced a new position in an <i>amicus</i> brief. See Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 16-24. An <i>amicus</i> brief interpreting a statute is entitled, at most, to deference under <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> 323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). See <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 229-233, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001). The weight accorded to an agency position under <i>Skidmore</i> \"depend[s] upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\" 323 U.S., at 140, 65 S.Ct. 161. See also <i>Mead,</i> 533 U.S., at 228, 121 S.Ct. 2164 (courts consider, <i>inter alia,</i> the \"consistency\" and \"persuasiveness\" of an agency's position); <i>Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala,</i> 508 U.S. 402, 417, 113 S.Ct. 2151, 124 L.Ed.2d 368 (1993) (\"[T]he consistency of an agency's position is a factor in assessing the weight that position is due.\"). Because the FDA's long-held view on the limited preemptive effect of \u00a7 360k(a) better comports with the presumption against preemption of state health and safety protections, as well as the purpose and history of the MDA, the FDA's new position is entitled to little weight.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Court regards \u00a7 360h(d) as unenlightening because it \"could not possibly mean that <i>all</i> state-law claims are not pre-empted\" and \"provides no guidance as to which statelaw claims are pre-empted and which are not.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1008, n. 4. Given the presumption against preemption operative even in construing a preemption clause, see <i>supra,</i> at 1003-1004, the perceived lack of \"guidance\" should cut against Medtronic, not in its favor.</p>\n<p>[10]  To the contrary, the bill did not need to create a federal claim for damages, witnesses testified, because \"[a] common-law right of action exist[ed].\" Hearings on S.1944 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 400 (1933) (statement of W.A.

See also <i>infra,</i> at 1019, n. 16 (decisions after 1976).</p>\n<p>[12]  See Leflar &amp; Adler, The Preemption Pentad: Federal Preemption of Products Liability Claims After <i>Medtronic,</i> 64 Tenn. L.Rev. 691, 704, n. 71 (1997) (\"Surely a furor would have been aroused by the very suggestion that ... medical devices should receive an exemption from products liability litigation while new drugs, subject to similar regulatory scrutiny from the same agency, should remain under the standard tort law regime.\"); Porter, The <i>Lohr</i> Decision: FDA Perspective and Position, 52 Food &amp; Drug L.J. 7, 11 (1997) (With preemption, the \"FDA's regulation of devices would have been accorded an entirely different weight in private tort litigation than its counterpart regulation of drugs and biologics. This disparity is neither justified nor appropriate, nor does the agency believe it was intended by Congress ....\").</p>\n<p>[13]  The Drug Amendments of 1962 reiterated Congress' intent not to preempt claims relying on state law: \"Nothing in the amendments... shall be construed as invalidating any provision of State law which would be valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of State law.\" \u00a7 202, 76 Stat. 793.</p>\n<p>[14]  Congress featured California's regulatory system in its discussion of \u00a7 360k(a), but it also identified California's system as a prime candidate for an exemption from preemption under \u00a7 360k(b). \"[R]equirements imposed under the California statute,\" the House Report noted, \"serve as an example of requirements that the Secretary should authorize to be continued (provided any application submitted by a State meets requirements pursuant to the reported bill).\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-853, p. 46. Thus Congress sought not to terminate all state premarket approval systems, but rather to place those systems under the controlling authority of the FDA.</p>\n<p>[15]  The process for approving a new drug begins with preclinical laboratory and animal testing. The sponsor of the new drug then submits an investigational new drug application seeking FDA approval to test the drug on humans. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(i); 21 CFR \u00a7 312.1 <i>et seq.</i> (2007). Clinical trials generally proceed in three phases involving successively larger groups of patients: 20 to 80 subjects in phase I; no more than several hundred subjects in phase II; and several hundred to several thousand subjects in phase III. 21 CFR \u00a7 312.21. After completing the clinical trials, the sponsor files a new drug application containing, <i>inter alia,</i> \"full reports of investigations\" showing whether the \"drug is safe for use and ... effective\"; the drug's composition; a description of the drug's manufacturing, processing, and packaging; and the proposed labeling for the drug. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(1).</p>\n<p>[16]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tobin v.

MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 06\u2013179.      Argued December 4, 2007\u2014Decided February 20, 2008\nThe Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) created a scheme of\n  federal safety oversight for medical devices while sweeping back state\n  oversight schemes. The statute provides that a State shall not \u201ces\n  tablish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for hu\n  man use any requirement\u2014. . . (1) which is different from, or in addi\n  tion to, any requirement applicable under [federal law] to the device,\n  and . . . (2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or\n  to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the de\n  vice under\u201d relevant federal law. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7360k(a). The MDA\n  calls for federal oversight of medical devices that varies with the type\n  of device at issue. The most extensive oversight is reserved for Class\n  III devices that undergo the premarket approval process. These de\n  vices may enter the market only if the FDA reviews their design, la\n  beling, and manufacturing specifications and determines that those\n  specifications provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effective\n  ness. Manufacturers may not make changes to such devices that\n  would affect safety or effectiveness unless they first seek and obtain\n  permission from the FDA.\n     Charles Riegel and his wife, petitioner Donna Riegel, brought suit\n  against respondent Medtronic after a Medtronic catheter ruptured in\n  Charles Riegel\u2019s coronary artery during heart surgery. The catheter\n  is a Class III device that received FDA premarket approval. The\n  Riegels alleged that the device was designed, labeled, and manufac\n  tured in a manner that violated New York common law. The District\n  Court held that the MDA pre-empted the Riegels\u2019 claims of strict li\n  ability; breach of implied warranty; and negligence in the design,\n2                     RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of the\n    catheter, and their claim of negligent manufacturing insofar as the\n    claim was not premised on the theory that Medtronic had violated\n    federal law. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The MDA\u2019s pre-emption clause bars common-law claims challeng\n ing the safety or effectiveness of a medical device marketed in a form\n that received premarket approval from the FDA. Pp. 8\u201317.\n    (a) The Federal Government has established \u201crequirement[s] appli\n cable . . . to\u201d Medtronic\u2019s catheter within \u00a7360k(a)(1)\u2019s meaning. In\n Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 495, 500\u2013501, the Court inter\n preted the MDA\u2019s pre-emption provision in a manner \u201csubstantially\n informed\u201d by an FDA regulation, 21 CFR \u00a7808.1(d), which says that\n state requirements are pre-empted only when the FDA \u201chas estab\n lished specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific re\n quirements applicable to a particular device\u201d under federal law.\n Premarket approval imposes \u201cspecific requirements applicable to a\n particular device.\u201d The FDA requires that a device that has received\n premarket approval be marketed without significant deviations from\n the specifications in the device\u2019s approval application, for the reason\n that the FDA has determined that those specifications provide a rea\n sonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    (b) Petitioner\u2019s common-law claims are pre-empted because they\n are based upon New York \u201crequirement[s]\u201d with respect to Med\n tronic\u2019s catheter that are \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d the federal\n ones, and that relate to safety and effectiveness, \u00a7360k(a). Pp. 10\u201317.\n       (i) Common-law negligence and strict-liability claims impose \u201cre\n quirement[s]\u201d under the ordinary meaning of that term, see, e.g.,\n Lohr, supra, at 503\u2013505, 512, Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505\n U. S. 504, 521\u2013523, 548\u2013549. There is nothing in the MDA that con\n tradicts this normal meaning. Pp. 10\u201312.\n       (ii) The Court rejects petitioner\u2019s contention that the duties un\n derlying her state-law tort claims are not pre-empted because general\n common-law duties are not requirements maintained \u201cwith respect to\n devices.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s suit depends upon New York\u2019s \u201ccontinu[ing] in\n effect\u201d general tort duties \u201cwith respect to\u201d Medtronic\u2019s catheter. Ti\n tle 21 CFR \u00a7808.1(d)(1)\u2014which states that MDA pre-emption does\n not extend to \u201c[s]tate or local requirements of general applicability\n [whose] purpose . . . relates either to other products in addition to de\n vices . . . or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are\n not limited to devices\u201d\u2014does not alter the Court\u2019s interpretation.\n Pp. 14\u201317.\n    (c) The Court declines to address in the first instance petitioner\u2019s\n argument that this lawsuit raises \u201cparallel\u201d claims that are not pre\n empted by \u00a7360k under Lohr, supra, at 495, 513.

S. C.\n\u00a7360k, bars common-law claims challenging the safety and\neffectiveness of a medical device given premarket approval\nby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52\nStat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7301 et seq., has long\nrequired FDA approval for the introduction of new drugs\ninto the market. Until the statutory enactment at issue\nhere, however, the introduction of new medical devices\nwas left largely for the States to supervise as they saw fit.\nSee Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475\u2013476 (1996).\n  The regulatory landscape changed in the 1960\u2019s and\n1970\u2019s, as complex devices proliferated and some failed.\nMost notably, the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device,\nintroduced in 1970, was linked to serious infections and\nseveral deaths, not to mention a large number of pregnan\n2                   RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncies. Thousands of tort claims followed. R. Bacigal, The\nLimits of Litigation: The Dalkon Shield Controversy 3\n(1990). In the view of many, the Dalkon Shield failure and\nits aftermath demonstrated the inability of the common-\nlaw tort system to manage the risks associated with dan\ngerous devices. See, e.g., S. Foote, Managing the Medical\nArms Race 151\u2013152 (1992). Several States adopted regu\nlatory measures, including California, which in 1970\nenacted a law requiring premarket approval of medical\ndevices. 1970 Cal. Stats. ch. 1573, \u00a7\u00a726670\u201326693; see\nalso Leflar & Adler, The Preemption Pentad: Federal\nPreemption of Products Liability Claims After Medtronic,\n64 Tenn. L. Rev. 691, 703, n. 66 (1997) (identifying 13\nstate statutes governing medical devices as of 1976).\n   Congress stepped in with passage of the Medical Device\nAmendments of 1976 (MDA), 21 U. S. C. \u00a7360c et seq.,1\nwhich swept back some state obligations and imposed a\nregime of detailed federal oversight. The MDA includes\nan express pre-emption provision that states:\n        \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section,\n     no State or political subdivision of a State may estab\n     lish or continue in effect with respect to a device in\n     tended for human use any requirement\u2014\n        \u201c(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any\n     requirement applicable under this chapter to the de\n     vice, and\n        \u201c(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of\n     the device or to any other matter included in a re\n     quirement applicable to the device under this chap\n     ter.\u201d \u00a7360k(a).\nThe exception contained in subsection (b) permits the\nFDA to exempt some state and local requirements from\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Unqualified \u00a7360 et seq. numbers hereinafter refer to sections of 21\n\nU.

S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npre-emption.\n   The new regulatory regime established various levels of\noversight for medical devices, depending on the risks they\npresent. Class I, which includes such devices as elastic\nbandages and examination gloves, is subject to the lowest\nlevel of oversight: \u201cgeneral controls,\u201d such as labeling\nrequirements. \u00a7360c(a)(1)(A); FDA, Device Advice: Device\nClasses, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/3132.html (all\nInternet materials as visited Feb. 14, 2008, and available\nin Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Class II, which includes such\ndevices as powered wheelchairs and surgical drapes, ibid.,\nis subject in addition to \u201cspecial controls\u201d such as perform\nance standards and postmarket surveillance measures,\n\u00a7360c(a)(1)(B).\n   The devices receiving the most federal oversight are\nthose in Class III, which include replacement heart valves,\nimplanted cerebella stimulators, and pacemaker pulse\ngenerators, FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, supra. In\ngeneral, a device is assigned to Class III if it cannot be\nestablished that a less stringent classification would pro\nvide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and\nthe device is \u201cpurported or represented to be for a use in\nsupporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is\nof substantial importance in preventing impairment of\nhuman health,\u201d or \u201cpresents a potential unreasonable risk\nof illness or injury.\u201d \u00a7360c(a)(1)(C)(ii).\n   Although the MDA established a rigorous regime of\npremarket approval for new Class III devices, it grand-\nfathered many that were already on the market. Devices\nsold before the MDA\u2019s effective date may remain on the\nmarket until the FDA promulgates, after notice and com\nment, a regulation requiring premarket approval.\n\u00a7\u00a7360c(f)(1), 360e(b)(1). A related provision seeks to limit\nthe competitive advantage grandfathered devices receive.\nA new device need not undergo premarket approval if the\nFDA finds it is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to another de\n4                RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvice exempt from premarket approval. \u00a7360c(f)(1)(A). The\nagency\u2019s review of devices for substantial equivalence is\nknown as the \u00a7510(k) process, named after the section of\nthe MDA describing the review. Most new Class III de\nvices enter the market through \u00a7510(k). In 2005, for\nexample, the FDA authorized the marketing of 3,148\ndevices under \u00a7510(k) and granted premarket approval to\njust 32 devices. P. Hutt, R. Merrill, & L. Grossman, Food\nand Drug Law 992 (3d ed. 2007).\n  Premarket approval is a \u201crigorous\u201d process. Lohr, 518\nU. S., at 477. A manufacturer must submit what is typi\ncally a multivolume application. FDA, Device Advice\u2014\nPremarket Approval (PMA) 18, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/\ndevadvice/pma/printer.html. It includes, among other\nthings, full reports of all studies and investigations of the\ndevice\u2019s safety and effectiveness that have been published\nor should reasonably be known to the applicant; a \u201cfull\nstatement\u201d of the device\u2019s \u201ccomponents, ingredients, and\nproperties and of the principle or principles of operation\u201d;\n\u201ca full description of the methods used in, and the facilities\nand controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and,\nwhen relevant, packing and installation of, such device\u201d;\nsamples or device components required by the FDA; and a\nspecimen of the proposed labeling. \u00a7360e(c)(1). Before\ndeciding whether to approve the application, the agency\nmay refer it to a panel of outside experts, 21 CFR\n\u00a7814.44(a) (2007), and may request additional data from\nthe manufacturer, \u00a7360e(c)(1)(G).\n  The FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing\neach application, Lohr, supra, at 477, and grants premar\nket approval only if it finds there is a \u201creasonable assur\nance\u201d of the device\u2019s \u201csafety and effectiveness,\u201d \u00a7360e(d).\nThe agency must \u201cweig[h] any probable benefit to health\nfrom the use of the device against any probable risk of\ninjury or illness from such use.\u201d \u00a7360c(a)(2)(C). It may\nthus approve devices that present great risks if they none\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

It approved, for example, under its Humanitarian\nDevice Exemption procedures, a ventricular assist device\nfor children with failing hearts, even though the survival\nrate of children using the device was less than 50 percent.\nFDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Sum\nmary of Safety and Probable Benefit 20 (2004), online at\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/H030003b.pdf.\n   The premarket approval process includes review of the\ndevice\u2019s proposed labeling. The FDA evaluates safety and\neffectiveness under the conditions of use set forth on the\nlabel, \u00a7360c(a)(2)(B), and must determine that the pro\nposed labeling is neither false nor misleading,\n\u00a7360e(d)(1)(A).\n   After completing its review, the FDA may grant or deny\npremarket approval. \u00a7360e(d). It may also condition\napproval on adherence to performance standards, 21 CFR\n\u00a7861.1(b)(3), restrictions upon sale or distribution, or\ncompliance with other requirements, \u00a7814.82. The agency\nis also free to impose device-specific restrictions by regula\ntion. \u00a7360j(e)(1).\n   If the FDA is unable to approve a new device in its\nproposed form, it may send an \u201capprovable letter\u201d indicat\ning that the device could be approved if the applicant\nsubmitted specified information or agreed to certain condi\ntions or restrictions. 21 CFR \u00a7814.44(e). Alternatively,\nthe agency may send a \u201cnot approvable\u201d letter, listing the\ngrounds that justify denial and, where practical, measures\nthat the applicant could undertake to make the device\napprovable. \u00a7814.44(f).\n   Once a device has received premarket approval, the\nMDA forbids the manufacturer to make, without FDA\npermission, changes in design specifications, manufactur\ning processes, labeling, or any other attribute, that would\naffect safety or effectiveness. \u00a7360e(d)(6)(A)(i). If the\napplicant wishes to make such a change, it must submit,\n6                RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand the FDA must approve, an application for supplemen\ntal premarket approval, to be evaluated under largely the\nsame criteria as an initial application. \u00a7360e(d)(6); 21 CFR\n\u00a7814.39(c).\n   After premarket approval, the devices are subject to\nreporting requirements. \u00a7360i. These include the obliga\ntion to inform the FDA of new clinical investigations or\nscientific studies concerning the device which the appli\ncant knows of or reasonably should know of, 21 CFR\n\u00a7814.84(b)(2), and to report incidents in which the device\nmay have caused or contributed to death or serious injury,\nor malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or\ncontribute to death or serious injury if it recurred,\n\u00a7803.50(a). The FDA has the power to withdraw premar\nket approval based on newly reported data or existing\ninformation and must withdraw approval if it determines\nthat a device is unsafe or ineffective under the condi-\ntions in its labeling. \u00a7360e(e)(1); see also \u00a7360h(e) (recall\nauthority).\n                              B\n  Except as otherwise indicated, the facts set forth in this\nsection appear in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. The\ndevice at issue is an Evergreen Balloon Catheter marketed\nby defendant-respondent Medtronic, Inc. It is a Class III\ndevice that received premarket approval from the FDA in\n1994; changes to its label received supplemental approvals\nin 1995 and 1996.\n  Charles Riegel underwent coronary angioplasty in 1996,\nshortly after suffering a myocardial infarction. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 56a. His right coronary artery was diffusely\ndiseased and heavily calcified. Riegel\u2019s doctor inserted the\nEvergreen Balloon Catheter into his patient\u2019s coronary\nartery in an attempt to dilate the artery, although the\ndevice\u2019s labeling stated that use was contraindicated for\npatients with diffuse or calcified stenoses. The label also\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwarned that the catheter should not be inflated beyond its\nrated burst pressure of eight atmospheres. Riegel\u2019s doctor\ninflated the catheter five times, to a pressure of 10 atmos\npheres; on its fifth inflation, the catheter ruptured. Com\nplaint 3. Riegel developed a heart block, was placed on life\nsupport, and underwent emergency coronary bypass\nsurgery.\n  Riegel and his wife Donna brought this lawsuit in April\n1999, in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of New York. Their complaint alleged that Med\ntronic\u2019s catheter was designed, labeled, and manufactured\nin a manner that violated New York common law, and\nthat these defects caused Riegel to suffer severe and per\nmanent injuries. The complaint raised a number of com\nmon-law claims. The District Court held that the MDA\npre-empted Riegel\u2019s claims of strict liability; breach of\nimplied warranty; and negligence in the design, testing,\ninspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of\nthe catheter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a; Complaint 3\u20134. It\nalso held that the MDA pre-empted a negligent manufac\nturing claim insofar as it was not premised on the theory\nthat Medtronic violated federal law. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n71a. Finally, the court concluded that the MDA pre\nempted Donna Riegel\u2019s claim for loss of consortium to the\nextent it was derivative of the pre-empted claims. Id., at\n68a; see also id., at 75a.2\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit affirmed these dismissals. 451 F. 3d 104 (2006).\nThe court concluded that Medtronic was \u201cclearly subject to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The District Court later granted summary judgment to Medtronic\n\non those claims of Riegel it had found not pre-empted, viz., that Med\ntronic breached an express warranty and was negligent in manufactur\ning because it did not comply with federal standards. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 90a. It consequently granted summary judgment as well on\nDonna Riegel\u2019s derivative consortium claim. Ibid. The Court of Ap\npeals affirmed these determinations, and they are not before us.\n8                  RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe federal, device-specific requirement of adhering to the\nstandards contained in its individual, federally approved\u201d\npremarket approval application. Id., at 118. The Riegels\u2019\nclaims were pre-empted because they \u201cwould, if successful,\nimpose state requirements that differed from, or added to\u201d\nthe device-specific federal requirements. Id., at 121. We\ngranted certiorari.3 551 U. S. ___ (2007).\n                               II\n  Since the MDA expressly pre-empts only state require\nments \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to, any requirement\napplicable . . . to the device\u201d under federal law,\n\u00a7360k(a)(1), we must determine whether the Federal\nGovernment has established requirements applicable to\nMedtronic\u2019s catheter. If so, we must then determine\nwhether the Riegels\u2019 common-law claims are based upon\nNew York requirements with respect to the device that are\n\u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d the federal ones, and\nthat relate to safety and effectiveness. \u00a7360k(a).\n  We turn to the first question. In Lohr, a majority of this\nCourt interpreted the MDA\u2019s pre-emption provision in a\nmanner \u201csubstantially informed\u201d by the FDA regulation\nset forth at 21 CFR \u00a7808.1(d). 518 U. S., at 495; see also\nid., at 500\u2013501. That regulation says that state require\nments are pre-empted \u201conly when the Food and Drug\nAdministration has established specific counterpart regu\nlations or there are other specific requirements applicable\nto a particular device . . . .\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7808.1(d). Informed\nby the regulation, we concluded that federal manufactur\ning and labeling requirements applicable across the board\nto almost all medical devices did not pre-empt the com\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Charles Riegel having died, Donna Riegel is now petitioner on her\n\nown behalf and as administrator of her husband\u2019s estate. 552 U. S. ___\n(2007). For simplicity\u2019s sake, the terminology of our opinion draws no\ndistinction between Charles Riegel and the Estate of Charles Riegel\nand refers to the claims as belonging to the Riegels.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmon-law claims of negligence and strict liability at issue in\nLohr. The federal requirements, we said, were not re\nquirements specific to the device in question\u2014they re\nflected \u201centirely generic concerns about device regulation\ngenerally.\u201d 518 U. S., at 501. While we disclaimed a\nconclusion that general federal requirements could never\npre-empt, or general state duties never be pre-empted, we\nheld that no pre-emption occurred in the case at hand\nbased on a careful comparison between the state and\nfederal duties at issue. Id., at 500\u2013501.\n   Even though substantial-equivalence review under\n\u00a7510(k) is device specific, Lohr also rejected the manufac\nturer\u2019s contention that \u00a7510(k) approval imposed device-\nspecific \u201crequirements.\u201d We regarded the fact that prod\nucts entering the market through \u00a7510(k) may be mar\nketed only so long as they remain substantial equivalents\nof the relevant pre-1976 devices as a qualification for an\nexemption rather than a requirement. Id., at 493\u2013494; see\nalso id., at 513 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dis\nsenting in part).\n   Premarket approval, in contrast, imposes \u201crequire\nments\u201d under the MDA as we interpreted it in Lohr.\nUnlike general labeling duties, premarket approval is\nspecific to individual devices. And it is in no sense an\nexemption from federal safety review\u2014it is federal safety\nreview. Thus, the attributes that Lohr found lacking in\n\u00a7510(k) review are present here. While \u00a7510(k) is \u201c \u2018fo\ncused on equivalence, not safety,\u2019 \u201d id., at 493 (opinion of\nthe Court), premarket approval is focused on safety, not\nequivalence. While devices that enter the market through\n\u00a7510(k) have \u201cnever been formally reviewed under the\nMDA for safety or efficacy,\u201d ibid., the FDA may grant\npremarket approval only after it determines that a device\noffers a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness,\n\u00a7360e(d). And while the FDA does not \u201c \u2018require\u2019 \u201d that a\ndevice allowed to enter the market as a substantial\n10              RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nequivalent \u201ctake any particular form for any particular\nreason,\u201d ibid., at 493, the FDA requires a device that has\nreceived premarket approval to be made with almost no\ndeviations from the specifications in its approval applica\ntion, for the reason that the FDA has determined that the\napproved form provides a reasonable assurance of safety\nand effectiveness.\n                             III\n  We turn, then, to the second question: whether the\nRiegels\u2019 common-law claims rely upon \u201cany requirement\u201d\nof New York law applicable to the catheter that is \u201cdiffer\nent from, or in addition to\u201d federal requirements and that\n\u201crelates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to\nany other matter included in a requirement applicable to\nthe device.\u201d \u00a7360k(a). Safety and effectiveness are the\nvery subjects of the Riegels\u2019 common-law claims, so the\ncritical issue is whether New York\u2019s tort duties constitute\n\u201crequirements\u201d under the MDA.\n                             A\n   In Lohr, five Justices concluded that common-law\ncauses of action for negligence and strict liability do im\npose \u201crequirement[s]\u201d and would be pre-empted by federal\nrequirements specific to a medical device. See 518 U. S.,\nat 512 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.,\nand SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ.); id., at 503\u2013505 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.). We adhere to that view. In interpreting two\nother statutes we have likewise held that a provision pre\nempting state \u201crequirements\u201d pre-empted common-law\nduties. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431\n(2005), found common-law actions to be pre-empted by a\nprovision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Roden\nticide Act that said certain States \u201c \u2018shall not impose or\ncontinue in effect any requirements for labeling or packag\ning in addition to or different from those required under\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis subchapter.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 443 (discussing 7 U. S. C.\n\u00a7136v(b); emphasis added). Cipollone v. Liggett Group,\nInc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992), held common-law actions pre\nempted by a provision of the Public Health Cigarette\nSmoking Act of 1969, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71334(b), which said that\n\u201c[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and\nhealth shall be imposed under State law with respect to\nthe advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\u201d whose\npackages were labeled in accordance with federal law. See\n505 U. S., at 523 (plurality opinion); id., at 548\u2013549\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting\nin part).\n  Congress is entitled to know what meaning this Court\nwill assign to terms regularly used in its enactments.\nAbsent other indication, reference to a State\u2019s \u201crequire\nments\u201d includes its common-law duties. As the plurality\nopinion said in Cipollone, common-law liability is \u201cprem\nised on the existence of a legal duty,\u201d and a tort judgment\ntherefore establishes that the defendant has violated a\nstate-law obligation. Id., at 522. And while the common-\nlaw remedy is limited to damages, a liability award \u201c \u2018can\nbe, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing\nconduct and controlling policy.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 521.\n  In the present case, there is nothing to contradict this\nnormal meaning. To the contrary, in the context of this\nlegislation excluding common-law duties from the scope of\npre-emption would make little sense. State tort law that\nrequires a manufacturer\u2019s catheters to be safer, but hence\nless effective, than the model the FDA has approved dis\nrupts the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law\nto the same effect. Indeed, one would think that tort law,\napplied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability\nstandard, is less deserving of preservation. A state stat\nute, or a regulation adopted by a state agency, could at\nleast be expected to apply cost-benefit analysis similar to\nthat applied by the experts at the FDA: How many more\n12                 RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nlives will be saved by a device which, along with its\ngreater effectiveness, brings a greater risk of harm? A\njury, on the other hand, sees only the cost of a more dan\ngerous design, and is not concerned with its benefits; the\npatients who reaped those benefits are not represented in\ncourt. As JUSTICE BREYER explained in Lohr, it is implau\nsible that the MDA was meant to \u201cgrant greater power (to\nset state standards \u2018different from, or in addition to\u2019 fed\neral standards) to a single state jury than to state officials\nacting through state administrative or legislative lawmak\ning processes.\u201d 518 U. S., at 504. That perverse distinc\ntion is not required or even suggested by the broad lan\nguage Congress chose in the MDA,4 and we will not turn\nsomersaults to create it.\n                             B\n   The dissent would narrow the pre-emptive scope of the\nterm \u201crequirement\u201d on the grounds that it is \u201cdifficult to\nbelieve that Congress would, without comment, remove all\nmeans of judicial recourse\u201d for consumers injured by FDA-\napproved devices. Post, at 5 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But, as we have\nexplained, this is exactly what a pre-emption clause for\nmedical devices does by its terms. The operation of a law\nenacted by Congress need not be seconded by a committee\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Riegels point to \u00a7360k(b), which authorizes the FDA to exempt\n\nstate \u201crequirements\u201d from pre-emption under circumstances that would\nrarely be met for common-law duties. But a law that permits an agency\nto exempt certain \u201crequirements\u201d from pre-emption does not suggest\nthat no other \u201crequirements\u201d exist. The Riegels also invoke \u00a7360h(d),\nwhich provides that compliance with certain FDA orders \u201cshall not\nrelieve any person from liability under Federal or State law.\u201d This\nindicates that some state-law claims are not pre-empted, as we held in\nLohr. But it could not possibly mean that all state-law claims are not\npre-empted, since that would deprive the MDA pre-emption clause of\nall content. And it provides no guidance as to which state-law claims\nare pre-empted and which are not.\n                    Cite as: 552 U.

S. 249, 253\u2013254 (1992).\nIt is not our job to speculate upon congressional motives.\nIf we were to do so, however, the only indication avail\nable\u2014 the text of the statute\u2014suggests that the solicitude\nfor those injured by FDA-approved devices, which the\ndissent finds controlling, was overcome in Congress\u2019s\nestimation by solicitude for those who would suffer with\nout new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the\ntort law of 50 States to all innovations.5\n   In the case before us, the FDA has supported the posi\ntion taken by our opinion with regard to the meaning of\nthe statute. We have found it unnecessary to rely upon\nthat agency view because we think the statute itself\nspeaks clearly to the point at issue. If, however, we had\nfound the statute ambiguous and had accorded the\nagency\u2019s current position deference, the dissent is correct,\nsee post, at 6, n. 8, that\u2014inasmuch as mere Skidmore\ndeference would seemingly be at issue\u2014the degree of\ndeference might be reduced by the fact that the agency\u2019s\nearlier position was different. See Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134 (1944); United States v. Mead Corp., 533\nU. S. 218 (2001); Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508\nU. S. 402, 417 (1993). But of course the agency\u2019s earlier\nposition (which the dissent describes at some length, post,\nat 5\u20136, and finds preferable) is even more compromised,\nindeed deprived of all claim to deference, by the fact that it\nis no longer the agency\u2019s position.\n   The dissent also describes at great length the experience\nunder the FDCA with respect to drugs and food and color\nadditives. Post, at 7\u201311. Two points render the conclusion\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Contrary  to JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 contention, post, at 2, we do not \u201cad\nvance\u201d this argument. We merely suggest that if one were to speculate\nupon congressional purposes, the best evidence for that would be found\nin the statute.\n14                  RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe dissent seeks to draw from that experience\u2014that the\npre-emption clause permits tort suits\u2014unreliable. (1) It\nhas not been established (as the dissent assumes) that no\ntort lawsuits are pre-empted by drug or additive approval\nunder the FDCA. (2) If, as the dissent believes, the pre\nemption clause permits tort lawsuits for medical devices\njust as they are (by hypothesis) permitted for drugs and\nadditives; and if, as the dissent believes, Congress wanted\nthe two regimes to be alike; Congress could have applied\nthe pre-emption clause to the entire FDCA. It did not do\nso, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies\nonly to medical devices.\n                               C\n  The Riegels contend that the duties underlying negli\ngence, strict-liability, and implied-warranty claims are not\npre-empted even if they impose \u201c \u2018requirements,\u2019 \u201d because\ngeneral common-law duties are not requirements main\ntained \u201c \u2018with respect to devices.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 34\u2013\n36. Again, a majority of this Court suggested otherwise in\nLohr. See 518 U. S., at 504\u2013505 (opinion of BREYER, J.);\nid., at 514 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist,\nC. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ.).6 And with good\nreason. The language of the statute does not bear the\nRiegels\u2019 reading.

Nothing in\nthe statutory text suggests that the pre-empted state\nrequirement must apply only to the relevant device, or\nonly to medical devices and not to all products and all\nactions in general.\n   The Riegels\u2019 argument to the contrary rests on the text\nof an FDA regulation which states that the MDA\u2019s pre\nemption clause does not extend to certain duties, including\n\u201c[s]tate or local requirements of general applicability\nwhere the purpose of the requirement relates either to\nother products in addition to devices (e.g., requirements\nsuch as general electrical codes, and the Uniform Com\nmercial Code (warranty of fitness)), or to unfair trade\npractices in which the requirements are not limited to\ndevices.\u201d 21 CFR \u00a7808.1(d)(1). Even assuming that this\nregulation could play a role in defining the MDA\u2019s pre\nemptive scope, it does not provide unambiguous support\nfor the Riegels\u2019 position. The agency\u2019s reading of its own\nrule is entitled to substantial deference, see Auer v. Rob\nbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997), and the FDA\u2019s view put\nforward in this case is that the regulation does not refer to\ngeneral tort duties of care, such as those underlying the\nclaims in this case that a device was designed, labeled, or\nmanufactured in an unsafe or ineffective manner. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 27\u201328. That is so,\naccording to the FDA, because the regulation excludes\nfrom pre-emption requirements that relate only inciden\ntally to medical devices, but not other requirements.\nGeneral tort duties of care, unlike fire codes or restrictions\non trade practices, \u201cdirectly regulate\u201d the device itself,\nincluding its design. Id., at 28. We find the agency\u2019s\nexplanation less than compelling, since the same could\nbe said of general requirements imposed by electrical\ncodes, the Uniform Commercial Code, or unfair-trade\npractice law, which the regulation specifically excludes\n16               RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom pre-emption.\n    Other portions of 21 CFR \u00a7808.1, however, support the\nagency\u2019s view that \u00a7808.1(d)(1) has no application to this\ncase (though still failing to explain why electrical codes,\nthe Uniform Commercial Code or unfair-trade-practice\nrequirements are different). Section 808.1(b) states that\nthe MDA sets forth a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d pre-empting state\nduties \u201chaving the force and effect of law (whether estab\nlished by statute, ordinance, regulation, or court decision)\n. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This sentence is far more com\nprehensible under the FDA\u2019s view that \u00a7808.1(d)(1) has no\napplication here than under the Riegels\u2019 view. We are\naware of no duties established by court decision other than\ncommon-law duties, and we are aware of no common-law\nduties that relate solely to medical devices.\n    The Riegels\u2019 reading is also in tension with the regula\ntion\u2019s statement that adulteration and misbranding claims\nare pre-empted when they \u201cha[ve] the effect of establish\ning a substantive requirement for a specific device, e.g., a\nspecific labeling requirement\u201d that is \u201cdifferent from, or in\naddition to\u201d a federal requirement. \u00a7808.1(d)(6)(ii). Surely\nthis means that the MDA would pre-empt a jury determi\nnation that the FDA-approved labeling for a pacemaker\nviolated a state common-law requirement for additional\nwarnings. The Riegels\u2019 reading of \u00a7808.1(d)(1), however,\nwould allow a claim for tortious mislabeling to escape pre\nemption so long as such a claim could also be brought\nagainst objects other than medical devices.\n    All in all, we think that \u00a7808.1(d)(1) can add nothing to\nour analysis but confusion. Neither accepting nor reject\ning the proposition that this regulation can properly be\nconsulted to determine the statute\u2019s meaning; and neither\naccepting nor rejecting the FDA\u2019s distinction between\ngeneral requirements that directly regulate and those that\nregulate only incidentally; the regulation fails to alter our\ninterpretation of the text insofar as the outcome of this\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

S. C.\n\u00a7360k, was not fully appreciated until many years after it\nwas enacted. It is an example of a statute whose text and\ngeneral objective cover territory not actually envisioned by\nits authors. In such cases we have frequently concluded\nthat \u201cit is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather\nthan the principal concerns of our legislators by which we\nare governed.\u201d Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services,\nInc., 523 U. S. 75, 79\u201380 (1998). Accordingly, while I\nagree with JUSTICE GINSBURG\u2019s description of the actual\nhistory and principal purpose of the pre-emption provision\nat issue in this case, post, at 4\u201311 (dissenting opinion), I\nam persuaded that its text does preempt state law re\nquirements that differ. I therefore write separately to add\nthese few words about the MDA\u2019s history and the meaning\nof \u201crequirements.\u201d\n   There is nothing in the preenactment history of the\nMDA suggesting that Congress thought state tort reme\ndies had impeded the development of medical devices. Nor\nis there any evidence at all to suggest that Congress de\ncided that the cost of injuries from Food and Drug Admini\n2                   RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nstration-approved medical devices was outweighed \u201cby\nsolicitude for those who would suffer without new medical\ndevices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50\nStates to all innovations.\u201d Ante, at 13 (opinion of the\nCourt). That is a policy argument advanced by the Court,\nnot by Congress. As JUSTICE GINSBURG persuasively\nexplains, the overriding purpose of the legislation was to\nprovide additional protection to consumers, not to with\ndraw existing protections. It was the then-recent devel\nopment of state premarket regulatory regimes that ex\nplained the need for a provision pre-empting conflicting\nadministrative rules. See Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518\nU. S. 470, 489 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[W]hen Congress\nenacted \u00a7360k, it was primarily concerned with the prob\nlem of specific, conflicting state statutes and regulations\nrather than the general duties enforced by common-law\nactions\u201d).\n  But the language of the provision reaches beyond such\nregulatory regimes to encompass other types of \u201crequire\nments.\u201d     Because common-law rules administered by\njudges, like statutes and regulations, create and define\nlegal obligations, some of them unquestionably qualify as\n\u201crequirements.\u201d1 See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505\nU. S. 504, 522 (1992) (\u201c[C]ommon-law damages actions of\nthe sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The verdicts of juries who obey those rules, however, are not \u201cre\n\nquirements\u201d of that kind. Juries apply rules, but do not make them.\nAnd while a jury\u2019s finding of liability may induce a defendant to alter\nits device or its label, this does not render the finding a \u201crequirement\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the MDA. \u201cA requirement is a rule of law that\nmust be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motivates\nan optional decision is not a requirement.\u201d Bates v. Dow Agrosciences\nLLC, 544 U. S. 431, 445 (2005). It is for that reason that the MDA does\nnot grant \u201ca single state jury\u201d any power whatsoever to set any stan\ndard that either conforms with or differs from a relevant federal stan\ndard. I do not agree with the colorful but inaccurate quotation on page\n12 of the Court\u2019s opinion.\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

The MDA\u2019s\npreemption clause, 21 U. S.

Congress, in my view, did not intend \u00a7360k(a) to effect\na radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking\ncompensation for injuries caused by defectively designed\nor labeled medical devices.\n   Congress\u2019 reason for enacting \u00a7360k(a) is evident. Until\n1976, the Federal Government did not engage in premar\nket regulation of medical devices. Some States acted to fill\nthe void by adopting their own regulatory systems for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 TheCourt\u2019s holding does not reach an important issue outside the\nbounds of this case: the preemptive effect of \u00a7360k(a) where evidence of\na medical device\u2019s defect comes to light only after the device receives\npremarket approval.\n2                   RIEGEL v.

The weight accorded to an agency\nposition under Skidmore \u201cdepend[s] upon the thoroughness evident in\nits consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with\nearlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it\npower to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d 323 U.

Because the FDA\u2019s long-held view on the limited preemptive\neffect of \u00a7360k(a) better comports with the presumption against pre\nemption of state health and safety protections, as well as the purpose\nand history of the MDA, the FDA\u2019s new position is entitled to little\nweight.\n                    Cite as: 552 U.

The prospect of ameliorative action by the\nFDA, however, lends no support to the conclusion that\nCongress intended largely to preempt state common-law\nsuits. Quite the opposite: Section 360h(d) states that\n\u201c[c]ompliance with an order issued under this section shall\nnot relieve any person from liability under Federal or\nState law.\u201d That provision anticipates \u201c[court-awarded]\ndamages for economic loss\u201d from which the value of any\nFDA-ordered remedy would be subtracted.

But \u00a7360k(a)\u2019s confinement to medical devices\nhardly renders irrelevant to the proper construction of the\nMDA\u2019s preemption provision the long history of federal\nand state controls over drugs and additives in the interest\nof public health and welfare. Congress\u2019 experience regu\nlating drugs and additives informed, and in part provided\nthe model for, its regulation of medical devices. I therefore\nturn to an examination of that experience.\n  Starting in 1938, the FDCA required that new drugs\nundergo preclearance by the FDA before they could be\nmarketed. See \u00a7505, 52 Stat. 1052. Nothing in the\nFDCA\u2019s text or legislative history suggested that FDA\npreclearance would immunize drug manufacturers from\ncommon-law tort suits.10\n  By the time Congress enacted the MDA in 1976, state\ncommon-law claims for drug labeling and design defects\nhad continued unabated despite nearly four decades of\nFDA regulation.11 Congress\u2019 inclusion of a preemption\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 To the contrary, the bill did not need to create a federal claim for\n\ndamages, witnesses testified, because \u201c[a] common-law right of action\nexist[ed].\u201d Hearings on S. 1944 before a Subcommittee of the Senate\nCommittee on Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 400 (1933) (statement of\nW.

Section 360k(a) must preempt\nstate common-law suits, Medtronic contends, because\nCongress would not have wanted state juries to second-\nguess the FDA\u2019s finding that a medical device is safe and\neffective when used as directed.

Ante, at 11\u201312.\n  But the process for approving new drugs is at least as\nrigorous as the premarket approval process for medical\ndevices.15 Courts that have considered the question have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Congress featured California\u2019s regulatory system in its discussion\nof \u00a7360k(a), but it also identified California\u2019s system as a prime candi\ndate for an exemption from preemption under \u00a7360k(b).\n\u201c[R]equirements imposed under the California statute,\u201d the House\nReport noted, \u201cserve as an example of requirements that the Secretary\nshould authorize to be continued (provided any application submitted\nby a State meets requirements pursuant to the reported bill).\u201d H. R.\nRep. No. 94\u2013853, p. 46. Thus Congress sought not to terminate all\nstate premarket approval systems, but rather to place those systems\nunder the controlling authority of the FDA.\n  15 The process for approving a new drug begins with preclinical labo\n\nratory and animal testing. The sponsor of the new drug then submits\nan investigational new drug application seeking FDA approval to test\nthe drug on humans. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(i); 21 CFR \u00a7312.1 et seq.\n(2007). Clinical trials generally proceed in three phases involving\nsuccessively larger groups of patients: 20 to 80 subjects in phase I; no\nmore than several hundred subjects in phase II; and several hundred to\nseveral thousand subjects in phase III. 21 CFR \u00a7312.21.

The question presented in that case is: \u201cWhether the prescrip\ntion drug labeling judgments imposed on manufacturers by the Food\nand Drug Administration (\u2018FDA\u2019) pursuant to FDA\u2019s comprehensive\nsafety and efficacy authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                  13\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndrug regulation thus indicate, contrary to Medtronic\u2019s\nargument, that Congress did not regard FDA regulation\nand state tort claims as mutually exclusive.\n                              III\n   Refusing to read \u00a7360k(a) as an automatic bar to state\ncommon-law tort claims would hardly render the FDA\u2019s\npremarket approval of Medtronic\u2019s medical device applica\ntion irrelevant to the instant suit. First, a \u201cpre-emption\nprovision, by itself, does not foreclose (through negative\nimplication) any possibility of implied conflict preemp\ntion.\u201d Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861,\n869 (2000) (brackets and internal quotation marks omit\nted). See also Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U. S. 280,\n288\u2013289 (1995). Accordingly, a medical device manufac\nturer may have a dispositive defense if it can identify an\nactual conflict between the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case\nand the FDA\u2019s premarket approval of the device in ques\ntion. As currently postured, this case presents no occasion\nto take up this issue for Medtronic relies exclusively on\n\u00a7360k(a) and does not argue conflict preemption.\n   Second, a medical device manufacturer may be entitled\nto interpose a regulatory compliance defense based on the\nFDA\u2019s approval of the premarket application. Most States\ndo not treat regulatory compliance as dispositive, but\nregard it as one factor to be taken into account by the jury.\nSee Sharkey, Federalism in Action: FDA Regulatory Pre\nemption in Pharmaceutical Cases in State Versus Federal\nCourts, 15 J. Law & Pol\u2019y 1013, 1024 (2007). See also\nRestatement (Third) of Torts \u00a716(a) (Proposed Final Draft\nNo. 1, Apr. 6, 2005). In those States, a manufacturer\ncould present the FDA\u2019s approval of its medical device as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmetic Act, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7301 et seq., preempt state law product liability\nclaims premised on the theory that different labeling judgments were\nnecessary to make drugs reasonably safe for use.\u201d Pet. for Cert. in\nWyeth v. Levine, O. T. 2007, No. 06\u20131249, p. i.\n14               RIEGEL v. MEDTRONIC, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nevidence that it used due care in the design and labeling of\nthe product.\n  The Court\u2019s broad reading of \u00a7360k(a) saves the manu\nfacturer from any need to urge these defenses. Instead,\nregardless of the strength of a plaintiff\u2019s case, suits will be\nbarred ab initio. The constriction of state authority or\ndered today was not mandated by Congress and is at odds\nwith the MDA\u2019s central purpose: to protect consumer\nsafety.\n                       *    *     *\n  For the reasons stated, I would hold that \u00a7360k(a) does\nnot preempt Riegel\u2019s suit. I would therefore reverse the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part.\n",

Until the statutory enactment at issue here, however, the introduction of new medical devices was left largely for the States to supervise as they saw fit. See <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> 518 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1003</span> U.S. 470, 475-476, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996).</p>\n<p>The regulatory landscape changed in the 1960's and 1970's, as complex devices proliferated and some failed. Most notably, the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, introduced in 1970, was linked to serious infections and several deaths, not to mention a large number of pregnancies. Thousands of tort claims followed. R. Bacigal, The Limits of Litigation: The Dalkon Shield Controversy 3 (1990). In the view of many, the Dalkon Shield failure and its aftermath demonstrated the inability of the common-law tort system to manage the risks associated with dangerous devices. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. Foote, Managing the Medical Arms Race 151-152 (1992). Several States adopted regulatory measures, including California, which in 1970 enacted a law requiring premarket approval of medical devices. 1970 Cal. Stats. ch. 1573, \u00a7\u00a7 26670-26693; see also Leflar &amp; Adler, The Preemption Pentad: Federal Preemption of Products Liability Claims After Medtronic, 64 Tenn. L.Rev. 691, 703, n. 66 (1997) (identifying 13 state statutes governing medical devices as of 1976).</p>\n<p>Congress stepped in with passage of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976(MDA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c <i>et seq.,</i><sup>[1]</sup> which swept back some state obligations and imposed a regime of detailed federal oversight. The MDA includes an express pre-emption provision that states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\" \u00a7 360k(a).</blockquote>\n<p>The exception contained in subsection (b) permits the FDA to exempt some state and local requirements from pre-emption.</p>\n<p>The new regulatory regime established various levels of oversight for medical devices, depending on the risks they present. Class I, which includes such devices as elastic bandages and examination gloves, is subject to the lowest level of oversight: \"general controls,\" such as labeling requirements. \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(A); FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, http://www.fda. gov/cdrh/devadvice/3132.html (all Internet materials as visited Feb. 14, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Class II, which includes such devices as powered wheelchairs and surgical drapes, <i>ibid.,</i> is subject in addition to \"special controls\" such as performance standards and postmarket surveillance measures, \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>The devices receiving the most federal oversight are those in Class III, which include replacement heart valves, implanted cerebella stimulators, and pacemaker pulse generators, FDA, Device Advice: Device Classes, <i>supra.</i> In general, a device is assigned to Class III if it cannot be established that a less stringent classification would provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and the device is \"purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health,\" or \"presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\" \u00a7 360c(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1004</span> Although the MDA established a rigorous regime of premarket approval for new Class III devices, it grandfathered many that were already on the market. Devices sold before the MDA's effective date may remain on the market until the FDA promulgates, after notice and comment, a regulation requiring premarket approval. \u00a7\u00a7 360c(f)(1), 360e(b)(1). A related provision seeks to limit the competitive advantage grandfathered devices receive. A new device need not undergo premarket approval if the FDA finds it is \"substantially equivalent\" to another device exempt from premarket approval. \u00a7 360c(f)(1)(A). The agency's review of devices for substantial equivalence is known as the \u00a7 510(k) process, named after the section of the MDA describing the review. Most new Class III devices enter the market through \u00a7 510(k). In 2005, for example, the FDA authorized the marketing of 3,148 devices under \u00a7 510(k) and granted premarket approval to just 32 devices. P. Hutt, R. Merrill, &amp; L. Grossman, Food and Drug Law 992 (3d ed.2007).</p>\n<p>Premarket approval is a \"rigorous\" process. <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 477, 116 S.Ct. 2240. A manufacturer must submit what is typically a multivolume application. FDA, Device Advice\u0097Premarket Approval (PMA) 18, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ devadvice/pma/printer.html. It includes, among other things, full reports of all studies and investigations of the device's safety and effectiveness that have been published or should reasonably be known to the applicant; a \"full statement\" of the device's \"components, ingredients, and properties and of the principle or principles of operation\"; \"a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and, when relevant, packing and installation of, such device\"; samples or device components required by the FDA; and a specimen of the proposed labeling. \u00a7 360e(c)(1). Before deciding whether to approve the application, the agency may refer it to a panel of outside experts, 21 CFR \u00a7 814.44(a) (2007), and may request additional data from the manufacturer, \u00a7 360e(c)(1)(G).</p>\n<p>The FDA spends an average of 1,200 hours reviewing each application, <i>Lohr, supra,</i> at 477, 116 S.Ct. 2240, and grants premarket approval only if it finds there is a \"reasonable assurance\" of the device's \"safety and effectiveness,\" \u00a7 360e(d). The agency must \"weig[h] any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.\" \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(C). It may thus approve devices that present great risks if they nonetheless offer great benefits in light of available alternatives. It approved, for example, under its Humanitarian Device Exemption procedures, a ventricular assist device for children with failing hearts, even though the survival rate of children using the device was less than 50 percent. FDA, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Summary of Safety and Probable Benefit 20 (2004), online at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/H 030003b.pdf.</p>\n<p>The premarket approval process includes review of the device's proposed labeling. The FDA evaluates safety and effectiveness under the conditions of use set forth on the label, \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(B), and must determine that the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading, \u00a7 360e(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>After completing its review, the FDA may grant or deny premarket approval. \u00a7 360e(d). It may also condition approval on adherence to performance standards, 21 CFR \u00a7 861.1(b)(3), restrictions upon sale or distribution, or compliance with other requirements, \u00a7 814.82. The agency is also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1005</span> free to impose device-specific restrictions by regulation. \u00a7 360j(e)(1).</p>\n<p>If the FDA is unable to approve a new device in its proposed form, it may send an \"approvable letter\" indicating that the device could be approved if the applicant submitted specified information or agreed to certain conditions or restrictions. 21 CFR \u00a7 814.44(e). Alternatively, the agency may send a \"not approvable\" letter, listing the grounds that justify denial and, where practical, measures that the applicant could undertake to make the device approvable. \u00a7 814.44(f).</p>\n<p>Once a device has received premarket approval, the MDA forbids the manufacturer to make, without FDA permission, changes in design specifications, manufacturing processes, labeling, or any other attribute, that would affect safety or effectiveness. \u00a7 360e(d)(6)(A)(i). If the applicant wishes to make such a change, it must submit, and the FDA must approve, an application for supplemental premarket approval, to be evaluated under largely the same criteria as an initial application. \u00a7 360e(d)(6); 21 CFR \u00a7 814.39(c).</p>\n<p>After premarket approval, the devices are subject to reporting requirements. \u00a7 360i. These include the obligation to inform the FDA of new clinical investigations or scientific studies concerning the device which the applicant knows of or reasonably should know of, 21 CFR \u00a7 814.84(b)(2), and to report incidents in which the device may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a manner that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if it recurred, \u00a7 803.50(a). The FDA has the power to withdraw premarket approval based on newly reported data or existing information and must withdraw approval if it determines that a device is unsafe or ineffective under the conditions in its labeling. \u00a7 360e(e)(1); see also \u00a7 360h(e) (recall authority).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Except as otherwise indicated, the facts set forth in this section appear in the opinion of the Court of Appeals. The device at issue is an Evergreen Balloon Catheter marketed by defendant-respondent Medtronic, Inc. It is a Class III device that received premarket approval from the FDA in 1994; changes to its label received supplemental approvals in 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p>Charles Riegel underwent coronary angioplasty in 1996, shortly after suffering a myocardial infarction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a. His right coronary artery was diffusely diseased and heavily calcified. Riegel's doctor inserted the Evergreen Balloon Catheter into his patient's coronary artery in an attempt to dilate the artery, although the device's labeling stated that use was contraindicated for patients with diffuse or calcified stenoses. The label also warned that the catheter should not be inflated beyond its rated burst pressure of eight atmospheres. Riegel's doctor inflated the catheter five times, to a pressure of 10 atmospheres; on its fifth inflation, the catheter ruptured. Complaint 3. Riegel developed a heart block, was placed on life support, and underwent emergency coronary bypass surgery.</p>\n<p>Riegel and his wife Donna brought this lawsuit in April 1999, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. Their complaint alleged that Medtronic's catheter was designed, labeled, and manufactured in a manner that violated New York common law, and that these defects caused Riegel to suffer severe and permanent injuries. The complaint raised a number of common-law claims. The District Court held that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1006</span> MDA pre-empted Riegel's claims of strict liability; breach of implied warranty; and negligence in the design, testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of the catheter. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a; Complaint 3-4. It also held that the MDA pre-empted a negligent manufacturing claim insofar as it was not premised on the theory that Medtronic violated federal law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a. Finally, the court concluded that the MDA preempted Donna Riegel's claim for loss of consortium to the extent it was derivative of the pre-empted claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 68a; see also <i>id.,</i> at 75a.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed these dismissals. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span> (2006). The court concluded that Medtronic was \"clearly subject to the federal, device-specific requirement of adhering to the standards contained in its individual, federally approved\" premarket approval application. <i>Id.,</i> at 118. The Riegels' claims were pre-empted because they \"would, if successful, impose state requirements that differed from, or added to\" the device-specific federal requirements. <i>Id.,</i> at 121. We granted certiorari.<sup>[3]</sup> 551 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 3000, 168 L.Ed.2d 725 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Since the MDA expressly pre-empts only state requirements \"different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable ... to the device\" under federal law, \u00a7 360k(a)(1), we must determine whether the Federal Government has established requirements applicable to Medtronic's catheter. If so, we must then determine whether the Riegels' common-law claims are based upon New York requirements with respect to the device that are \"different from, or in addition to\" the federal ones, and that relate to safety and effectiveness. \u00a7 360k(a).</p>\n<p>We turn to the first question. In <i>Lohr,</i> a majority of this Court interpreted the MDA's pre-emption provision in a manner \"substantially informed\" by the FDA regulation set forth at 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d). 518 U.S., at 495, 116 S.Ct. 2240; see also <i>id.,</i> at 500-501, 116 S.Ct. 2240. That regulation says that state requirements are pre-empted \"only when the Food and Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device....\" 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d). Informed by the regulation, we concluded that federal manufacturing and labeling requirements applicable across the board to almost all medical devices did not pre-empt the common-law claims of negligence and strict liability at issue in <i>Lohr.</i> The federal requirements, we said, were not requirements specific to the device in question\u0097 they reflected \"entirely generic concerns about device regulation generally.\" 518 U.S., at 501, 116 S.Ct. 2240. While we disclaimed a conclusion that general federal requirements could never pre-empt, or general state duties never be pre-empted, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1007</span> we held that no pre-emption occurred in the case at hand based on a careful comparison between the state and federal duties at issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 500-501, 116 S.Ct. 2240.</p>\n<p>Even though substantial-equivalence review under \u00a7 510(k) is device specific, <i>Lohr</i> also rejected the manufacturer's contention that \u00a7 510(k) approval imposed device-specific \"requirements.\" We regarded the fact that products entering the market through \u00a7 510(k) may be marketed only so long as they remain substantial equivalents of the relevant pre-1976 devices as a qualification for an exemption rather than a requirement. <i>Id.,</i> at 493-494, 116 S.Ct. 2240; see also <i>id.,</i> at 513, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Premarket approval, in contrast, imposes \"requirements\" under the MDA as we interpreted it in <i>Lohr.</i> Unlike general labeling duties, premarket approval is specific to individual devices. And it is in no sense an exemption from federal safety review\u0097it <i>is</i> federal safety review. Thus, the attributes that <i>Lohr</i> found lacking in \u00a7 510(k) review are present here. While \u00a7 510(k) is \"`focused on <i>equivalence,</i> not safety,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 493, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of the Court), premarket approval is focused on safety, not equivalence. While devices that enter the market through \u00a7 510(k) have \"never been formally reviewed under the MDA for safety or efficacy,\" <i>ibid.,</i> the FDA may grant premarket approval only after it determines that a device offers a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, \u00a7 360e(d). And while the FDA does not \"`require'\" that a device allowed to enter the market as a substantial equivalent \"take any particular form for any particular reason,\" <i>ibid.,</i> at 493, 116 S.Ct. 2240, the FDA requires a device that has received premarket approval to be made with almost no deviations from the specifications in its approval application, for the reason that the FDA has determined that the approved form provides a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>We turn, then, to the second question: whether the Riegels' common-law claims rely upon \"any requirement\" of New York law applicable to the catheter that is \"different from, or in addition to\" federal requirements and that \"relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device.\" \u00a7 360k(a). Safety and effectiveness are the very subjects of the Riegels' common-law claims, so the critical issue is whether New York's tort duties constitute \"requirements\" under the MDA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Lohr,</i> five Justices concluded that common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability do impose \"requirement[s]\" and would be pre-empted by federal requirements specific to a medical device. See 518 U.S., at 512, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ.); <i>id.,</i> at 503-505, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of BREYER, J.). We adhere to that view. In interpreting two other statutes we have likewise held that a provision pre-empting state \"requirements\" pre-empted common-law duties. <i>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142892\"><a href=\"/opinion/142892/bates-v-dow-agrosciences-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 1788, 161 L.Ed.2d 687 (2005), found common-law actions to be pre-empted by a provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act that said certain States \"`shall not impose or continue in effect <i>any requirements</i> for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1008</span> this subchapter.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 443, 125 S.Ct. 1788 (discussing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136v(b); emphasis added). <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112777\"><a href=\"/opinion/112777/cipollone-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992), held common-law actions pre-empted by a provision of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b), which said that \"[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\" whose packages were labeled in accordance with federal law. See 505 U.S., at 523, 112 S.Ct. 2608 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 548-549, 112 S.Ct. 2608 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Congress is entitled to know what meaning this Court will assign to terms regularly used in its enactments. Absent other indication, reference to a State's \"requirements\" includes its common-law duties. As the plurality opinion said in <i>Cipollone,</i> common-law liability is \"premised on the existence of a legal duty,\" and a tort judgment therefore establishes that the defendant has violated a state-law obligation. <i>Id.,</i> at 522, 112 S.Ct. 2608. And while the common-law remedy is limited to damages, a liability award \"`can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 521, 112 S.Ct. 2608.</p>\n<p>In the present case, there is nothing to contradict this normal meaning. To the contrary, in the context of this legislation excluding common-law duties from the scope of pre-emption would make little sense. State tort law that requires a manufacturer's catheters to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved disrupts the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect. Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less deserving of preservation. A state statute, or a regulation adopted by a state agency, could at least be expected to apply cost-benefit analysis similar to that applied by the experts at the FDA: How many more lives will be saved by a device which, along with its greater effectiveness, brings a greater risk of harm? A jury, on the other hand, sees only the cost of a more dangerous design, and is not concerned with its benefits; the patients who reaped those benefits are not represented in court. As Justice BREYER explained in <i>Lohr,</i> it is implausible that the MDA was meant to \"grant greater power (to set state standards `different from, or in addition to' federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials acting through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes.\" 518 U.S., at 504, 116 S.Ct. 2240. That perverse distinction is not required or even suggested by the broad language Congress chose in the MDA,<sup>[4]</sup> and we will not turn somersaults to create it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The dissent would narrow the pre-emptive scope of the term \"requirement\" on <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1009</span> the grounds that it is \"difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\" for consumers injured by FDA-approved devices. <i>Post,</i> at 1015 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). But, as we have explained, this is exactly what a pre-emption clause for medical devices does by its terms. The operation of a law enacted by Congress need not be seconded by a committee report on pain of judicial nullification. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112706\"><a href=\"/opinion/112706/connecticut-nat-bank-v-germain/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 253-254, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). It is not our job to speculate upon congressional motives. If we were to do so, however, the only indication available\u0097 the text of the statute\u0097suggests that the solicitude for those injured by FDA-approved devices, which the dissent finds controlling, was overcome in Congress's estimation by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>In the case before us, the FDA has supported the position taken by our opinion with regard to the meaning of the statute. We have found it unnecessary to rely upon that agency view because we think the statute itself speaks clearly to the point at issue. If, however, we had found the statute ambiguous and had accorded the agency's current position deference, the dissent is correct, see <i>post,</i> at 1016, n. 8, that\u0097inasmuch as mere <i>Skidmore</i> deference would seemingly be at issue\u0097the degree of deference might be reduced by the fact that the agency's earlier position was different. See <i>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104034\"><a href=\"/opinion/104034/skidmore-v-swift-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944); <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001); <i>Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112875\"><a href=\"/opinion/112875/good-samaritan-hospital-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span>, 417, 113 S.Ct. 2151, 124 L.Ed.2d 368 (1993). But of course the agency's earlier position (which the dissent describes at some length, <i>post,</i> at 1015-1016, and finds preferable) is even more compromised, indeed deprived of all claim to deference, by the fact that it is no longer the agency's position.</p>\n<p>The dissent also describes at great length the experience under the FDCA with respect to drugs and food and color additives. <i>Post,</i> at 1016-1018. Two points render the conclusion the dissent seeks to draw from that experience\u0097that the pre-emption clause permits tort suits\u0097 unreliable. (1) It has not been established (as the dissent assumes) that no tort lawsuits are pre-empted by drug or additive approval under the FDCA. (2) If, as the dissent believes, the pre-emption clause permits tort lawsuits for medical devices just as they are (by hypothesis) permitted for drugs and additives; and if, as the dissent believes, Congress wanted the two regimes to be alike; Congress could have applied the pre-emption clause to the entire FDCA. It did not do so, but instead wrote a pre-emption clause that applies only to medical devices.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The Riegels contend that the duties underlying negligence, strict-liability, and implied-warranty claims are not pre-empted even if they impose \"`requirements,'\" because general common-law duties are not requirements maintained \"`with respect to devices.'\" Brief for Petitioner 34-36. Again, a majority of this Court suggested otherwise in <i>Lohr.</i> See 518 U.S., at 504-505, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of BREYER, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 514, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (opinion of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1010</span> O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ.).<sup>[6]</sup> And with good reason. The language of the statute does not bear the Riegels' reading. The MDA provides that no State \"may establish or continue in effect <i>with respect to a device ... any requirement</i>\" relating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or in addition to, federal requirements. \u00a7 360k(a) (emphasis added). The Riegels' suit depends upon New York's \"continu[ing] in effect\" general tort duties \"with respect to\" Medtronic's catheter. Nothing in the statutory text suggests that the pre-empted state requirement must apply <i>only</i> to the relevant device, or only to medical devices and not to all products and all actions in general.</p>\n<p>The Riegels' argument to the contrary rests on the text of an FDA regulation which states that the MDA's preemption clause does not extend to certain duties, including \"[s]tate or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products in addition to devices (e.g., requirements such as general electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)), or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited to devices.\" 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1(d)(1). Even assuming that this regulation could play a role in defining the MDA's pre-emptive scope, it does not provide unambiguous support for the Riegels' position. The agency's reading of its own rule is entitled to substantial deference, see <i>Auer v. Robbins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118089\"><a href=\"/opinion/118089/auer-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997), and the FDA's view put forward in this case is that the regulation does not refer to general tort duties of care, such as those underlying the claims in this case that a device was designed, labeled, or manufactured in an unsafe or ineffective manner. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27-28. That is so, according to the FDA, because the regulation excludes from pre-emption requirements that relate only incidentally to medical devices, but not other requirements. General tort duties of care, unlike fire codes or restrictions on trade practices, \"directly regulate\" the device itself, including its design. <i>Id.,</i> at 28. We find the agency's explanation less than compelling, since the same could be said of general requirements imposed by electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code, or unfair-trade-practice law, which the regulation specifically excludes from pre-emption.</p>\n<p>Other portions of 21 CFR \u00a7 808.1, however, support the agency's view that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) has no application to this case (though still failing to explain why electrical codes, the Uniform Commercial Code or unfair-trade-practice requirements are different). Section 808.1(b) states that the MDA sets forth a \"general rule\" pre-empting state duties \"having the force and effect of law (whether established by statute, ordinance, regulation, <i>or court decision</i>).....\" (Emphasis added.) This sentence is far more comprehensible under the FDA's view that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) has no application here than under the Riegels' view. We are aware of no duties established by court decision other than common-law duties, and we are aware of no common-law duties that relate solely to medical devices.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1011</span> The Riegels' reading is also in tension with the regulation's statement that adulteration and misbranding claims are pre-empted when they \"ha[ve] the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device, e.g., a specific labeling requirement\" that is \"different from, or in addition to\" a federal requirement. \u00a7 808.1(d)(6)(ii). Surely this means that the MDA would pre-empt a jury determination that the FDA-approved labeling for a pacemaker violated a state common-law requirement for additional warnings. The Riegels' reading of \u00a7 808.1(d)(1), however, would allow a claim for tortious mislabeling to escape pre-emption so long as such a claim could also be brought against objects other than medical devices.</p>\n<p>All in all, we think that \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) can add nothing to our analysis but confusion. Neither accepting nor rejecting the proposition that this regulation can properly be consulted to determine the statute's meaning; and neither accepting nor rejecting the FDA's distinction between general requirements that directly regulate and those that regulate only incidentally; the regulation fails to alter our interpretation of the text insofar as the outcome of this case is concerned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>State requirements are pre-empted under the MDA only to the extent that they are \"different from, or in addition to\" the requirements imposed by federal law. \u00a7 360k(a)(1). Thus, \u00a7 360k does not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations; the state duties in such a case \"parallel,\" rather than add to, federal requirements. <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 495, 116 S.Ct. 2240; see also <i>id.,</i> at 513, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The District Court in this case recognized that parallel claims would not be pre-empted, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a-71a, but it interpreted the claims here to assert that Medtronic's device violated state tort law notwithstanding compliance with the relevant federal requirements, see <i>id.,</i> at 68a. Although the Riegels now argue that their lawsuit raises parallel claims, they made no such contention in their briefs before the Second Circuit, nor did they raise this argument in their petition for certiorari. We decline to address that argument in the first instance here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The significance of the pre-emption provision in the Medical Device Amendments of 1976(MDA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k, was not fully appreciated until many years after it was enacted. It is an example of a statute whose text and general objective cover territory not actually envisioned by its authors. In such cases we have frequently concluded that \"it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" <i>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 79-80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998). Accordingly, while I agree with Justice GINSBURG's description of the actual history and principal purpose of the pre-emption provision at issue in this case, <i>post,</i> at 1014-1018 (dissenting opinion), I am persuaded that its text does preempt state law requirements that differ. I therefore write separately to add these few words about the MDA's history and the meaning of \"requirements.\"</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1012</span> There is nothing in the preenactment history of the MDA suggesting that Congress thought state tort remedies had impeded the development of medical devices. Nor is there any evidence at all to suggest that Congress decided that the cost of injuries from Food and Drug Administration-approved medical devices was outweighed \"by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1009 (opinion of the Court). That is a policy argument advanced by the Court, not by Congress. As Justice GINSBURG persuasively explains, the overriding purpose of the legislation was to provide additional protection to consumers, not to withdraw existing protections. It was the then-recent development of state premarket regulatory regimes that explained the need for a provision pre-empting conflicting administrative rules. See <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118055\"><a href=\"/opinion/118055/medtronic-inc-v-lohr/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span>, 489, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\"[W]hen Congress enacted \u00a7 360k, it was primarily concerned with the problem of specific, conflicting state statutes and regulations rather than the general duties enforced by common-law actions\").</p>\n<p>But the language of the provision reaches beyond such regulatory regimes to encompass other types of \"requirements.\" Because common-law rules administered by judges, like statutes and regulations, create and define legal obligations, some of them unquestionably qualify as \"requirements.\"<sup>[1]</sup> See <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112777\"><a href=\"/opinion/112777/cipollone-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 522, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (\"[C]ommon-law damages actions of the sort raised by petitioner are premised on the existence of a legal duty, and it is difficult to say that such actions do not impose `requirements or prohibitions.'... [I]t is the essence of the common law to enforce duties that are either affirmative <i>requirements</i> or negative <i>prohibitions</i>\" (plurality opinion) (emphasis added)). And although not all common-law rules qualify as \"requirements,\"<sup>[2]</sup> the Court correctly points out that five Justices in <i>Lohr</i> concluded that the common-law causes of action for negligence and strict liability at issue in that case imposed \"requirements\" that were pre-empted by federal requirements specific to a medical device. Moreover, I agree with the Court's cogent explanation of why the Riegels' claims are predicated on New York common-law duties that constitute <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1013</span> requirements with respect to the device at issue that differ from federal requirements relating to safety and effectiveness. I therefore join the Court's judgment and all of its opinion except for Parts III-A and III-B.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA or Act), 90 Stat. 539, as construed by the Court, cut deeply into a domain historically occupied by state law. The MDA's preemption clause, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a), the Court holds, spares medical device manufacturers from personal injury claims alleging flaws in a design or label once the application for the design or label has gained premarket approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); a state damages remedy, the Court instructs, persists only for claims \"premised on a violation of FDA regulations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1011.<sup>[1]</sup> I dissent from today's constriction of state authority. Congress, in my view, did not intend \u00a7 360k(a) to effect a radical curtailment of state common-law suits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices.</p>\n<p>Congress' reason for enacting \u00a7 360k(a) is evident. Until 1976, the Federal Government did not engage in premarket regulation of medical devices. Some States acted to fill the void by adopting their own regulatory systems for medical devices. Section 360k(a) responded to that state regulation, and particularly to California's system of premarket approval for medical devices, by preempting State initiatives absent FDA permission.

Where the text of a preemption clause is open to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily \"accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.\" <i>Bates,</i> 544 U.S., at 449, 125 S.Ct. 1788.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The MDA's preemption clause states:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a).</blockquote>\n<p>\"Absent other indication,\" the Court states, \"reference to a State's `requirements' includes its common-law duties.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1008. Regarding the MDA, however, \"other indication\" is not \"[a]bsent.\" Contextual examination of the Act convinces me that \u00a7 360k(a)'s inclusion of the term \"requirement\" should not prompt a sweeping preemption of mine-run claims for relief under state tort law.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted the MDA \"to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use.\" 90 Stat. 539 (preamble).<sup>[4]</sup> A series of high-profile medical device failures that caused extensive injuries and loss of life propelled adoption of the MDA.<sup>[5]</sup> Conspicuous among these failures was the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device, used by approximately 2.2 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1015</span> million women in the United States between 1970 and 1974.

By early 1976, \"more than 500 lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages totaling more than $400 million\" had been filed. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[6]</sup> Given the publicity attending the Dalkon Shield litigation and Congress' awareness of the suits at the time the MDA was under consideration, I find informative the absence of any sign of a legislative design to preempt state common-law tort actions.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court recognizes that \"\u00a7 360k does not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1011. That remedy, although important, does not help consumers injured by devices that receive FDA approval but nevertheless prove unsafe. The MDA's failure to create any federal compensatory remedy for such consumers further suggests that Congress did not intend broadly to preempt state common-law suits grounded on allegations independent of FDA requirements. It is \"difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse\" for large numbers of consumers injured by defective medical devices. <i>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111056\"><a href=\"/opinion/111056/silkwood-v-kerr-mcgee-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 251, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984).</p>\n<p>The former chief counsel to the FDA explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"FDA's view is that FDA product approval and state tort liability usually operate independently, each providing a significant, yet distinct, layer of consumer protection. FDA regulation of a device cannot anticipate and protect against all safety risks to individual consumers. Even the most thorough regulation of a product such as a critical medical device may fail to identify potential problems presented by the product. Regulation cannot protect against all possible injuries that might result from use of a device over time. Preemption of all such claims would result in the loss of a significant layer of consumer protection ....\" Porter, The <i>Lohr</i> Decision: FDA Perspective and Position, 52 Food &amp; Drug L.J. 7, 11 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p>Cf. Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> on Pet. for Cert. in <i>Smiths Industries Medical Systems, Inc. v.

Hile, Associate Comm'r for Regulatory Affairs, to National Women's Health Network (Mar. 8, 1984).<sup>[8]</sup> The Court's construction of \u00a7 360k(a) has the \"perverse effect\" of granting broad immunity \"to an entire industry that, in the judgment of Congress, needed more stringent regulation,\" <i>Lohr,</i> 518 U.S., at 487, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (plurality opinion), not exemption from liability in tort litigation.</p>\n<p>The MDA does grant the FDA authority to order certain remedial action if, <i>inter alia,</i> it concludes that a device \"presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health\" and that notice of the defect \"would not by itself be sufficient to eliminate the unreasonable risk.\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360h(b)(1)(A). Thus the FDA may order the manufacturer to repair the device, replace it, refund the purchase price, cease distribution, or recall the device. \u00a7 360h(b)(2), (e). The prospect of ameliorative action by the FDA, however, lends no support to the conclusion that Congress intended largely to preempt state common-law suits. Quite the opposite: Section 360h(d) states that \"[c]ompliance with an order issued under this section shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law.\" That provision anticipates \"[court-awarded] damages for economic loss\" from which the value of any FDA-ordered remedy would be subtracted. <i>Ibid.</i><sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Congress enacted the MDA after decades of regulating drugs and food and color additives under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <i>et seq.</i> The FDCA contains no preemption clause, and thus the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 360k(a) has no bearing on tort suits involving drugs and additives. But \u00a7 360k(a)'s confinement to medical devices hardly renders irrelevant to the proper construction of the MDA's preemption provision the long history of federal and state controls over drugs and additives in the interest of public health and welfare. Congress' experience regulating drugs and additives informed, and in part provided the model for, its regulation of medical <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1017</span> devices. I therefore turn to an examination of that experience.</p>\n<p>Starting in 1938, the FDCA required that new drugs undergo preclearance by the FDA before they could be marketed. See \u00a7 505, 52 Stat. 1052. Nothing in the FDCA's text or legislative history suggested that FDA preclearance would immunize drug manufacturers from common-law tort suits.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>By the time Congress enacted the MDA in 1976, state common-law claims for drug labeling and design defects had continued unabated despite nearly four decades of FDA regulation.<sup>[11]</sup> Congress' inclusion of a preemption clause in the MDA was not motivated by concern that similar state tort actions could be mounted regarding medical devices.<sup>[12]</sup> Rather, Congress included \u00a7 360k(a) and (b) to empower the FDA to exercise control over state premarket approval systems installed at a time when there was no preclearance at the federal level. See <i>supra,</i> at 1014, and n. 3; <i>infra,</i> at 1018, and n. 14.</p>\n<p>Between 1938 and 1976, Congress enacted a series of premarket approval requirements, first for drugs, then for additives. Premarket control, as already noted, commenced with drugs in 1938. In 1958, Congress required premarket approval for food additives. Food Additives Amendment, \u00a7 3, 72 Stat. 1785, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 348. In 1960, it required premarket approval for color additives. Color Additive Amendments, \u00a7 103(b), 74 Stat. 399, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 379e. In 1962, it expanded the premarket approval process for new drugs to include review for effectiveness. Drug Amendments, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1018</span> \u00a7 101, 76 Stat. 781, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321 <i>et seq.</i> And in 1968, it required premarket approval for new animal drugs. Animal Drug Amendments, \u00a7 101(b), 82 Stat. 343, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b. None of these Acts contained a preemption clause.</p>\n<p>The measures just listed, like the MDA, were all enacted with common-law personal injury litigation over defective products a prominent part of the legal landscape.<sup>[13]</sup> At the time of each enactment, no state regulations required premarket approval of the drugs or additives in question, so no preemption clause was needed as a check against potentially conflicting state regulatory regimes. See Brief for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 10.</p>\n<p>A different situation existed as to medical devices when Congress developed and passed the MDA. As the House Report observed:</p>\n<blockquote>\"In the absence of effective Federal regulation of medical devices, some States have established their own programs. The most comprehensive State regulation of which the Committee is aware is that of California, which in 1970 adopted the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. This law requires premarket approval of all new medical devices, requires compliance of device manufacturers with good manufacturing practices and authorizes inspection of establishments which manufacture devices. Implementation of the Sherman Law has resulted in the <i>requirement</i> that intrauterine devices are subject to premarket clearance in California.\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-853, p. 45 (emphasis added).<sup>[14]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>In sum, state premarket regulation of medical devices, not any design to suppress tort suits, accounts for Congress' inclusion of a preemption clause in the MDA; no such clause figures in earlier federal laws regulating drugs and additives, for States had not installed comparable control regimes in those areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Congress' experience regulating drugs also casts doubt on Medtronic's policy arguments for reading \u00a7 360k(a) to preempt state tort claims. Section 360k(a) must preempt state common-law suits, Medtronic contends, because Congress would not have wanted state juries to second-guess the FDA's finding that a medical device is safe and effective when used as directed. Brief for Respondent 42-49. The Court is similarly minded. <i>Ante,</i> at 1008-1009.</p>\n<p>But the process for approving new drugs is at least as rigorous as the premarket approval process for medical devices.<sup>[15]</sup> Courts that have considered the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1019</span> question have overwhelmingly held that FDA approval of a new drug application does not preempt state tort suits.<sup>[16]</sup> Decades of drug regulation thus indicate, contrary to Medtronic's argument, that Congress did not regard FDA regulation and state tort claims as mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Refusing to read \u00a7 360k(a) as an automatic bar to state common-law tort claims would hardly render the FDA's premarket approval of Medtronic's medical device application irrelevant to the instant suit. First, a \"pre-emption provision, by itself, does not foreclose (through negative implication) any possibility of implied conflict preemption.\" <i>Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118371\"><a href=\"/opinion/118371/geier-v-american-honda-motor-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></a></span>, 869, 120 S.Ct. 1913, 146 L.Ed.2d 914 (2000) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).

Accordingly, a medical device manufacturer may have a dispositive defense if it can identify an actual conflict <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1020</span> between the plaintiff's theory of the case and the FDA's premarket approval of the device in question. As currently postured, this case presents no occasion to take up this issue for Medtronic relies exclusively on \u00a7 360k(a) and does not argue conflict preemption.</p>\n<p>Second, a medical device manufacturer may be entitled to interpose a regulatory compliance defense based on the FDA's approval of the premarket application. Most States do not treat regulatory compliance as dispositive, but regard it as one factor to be taken into account by the jury. See Sharkey, Federalism in Action: FDA Regulatory Preemption in Pharmaceutical Cases in State Versus Federal Courts, 15 J. Law &amp; Pol'y 1013, 1024 (2007). See also Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 16(a) (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, Apr. 6, 2005). In those States, a manufacturer could present the FDA's approval of its medical device as evidence that it used due care in the design and labeling of the product.</p>\n<p>The Court's broad reading of \u00a7 360k(a) saves the manufacturer from any need to urge these defenses. Instead, regardless of the strength of a plaintiff's case, suits will be barred <i>ab initio.</i> The constriction of state authority ordered today was not mandated by Congress and is at odds with the MDA's central purpose: to protect consumer safety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, I would hold that \u00a7 360k(a) does not preempt Riegel's suit. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Unqualified \u00a7 360 <i>et seq.</i> numbers hereinafter refer to sections of 21 U.S.C.</p>\n<p>[2]  The District Court later granted summary judgment to Medtronic on those claims of Riegel it had found not pre-empted, viz., that Medtronic breached an express warranty and was negligent in manufacturing because it did not comply with federal standards. App. to Pet. for Cert. 90a. It consequently granted summary judgment as well on Donna Riegel's derivative consortium claim. <i>Ibid.</i> The Court of Appeals affirmed these determinations, and they are not before us.</p>\n<p>[3]  Charles Riegel having died, Donna Riegel is now petitioner on her own behalf and as administrator of her husband's estate. 552 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 3000, 168 L.Ed.2d 725 (2007). For simplicity's sake, the terminology of our opinion draws no distinction between Charles Riegel and the Estate of Charles Riegel and refers to the claims as belonging to the Riegels.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Riegels point to \u00a7 360k(b), which authorizes the FDA to exempt state \"requirements\" from pre-emption under circumstances that would rarely be met for common-law duties. But a law that permits an agency to exempt certain \"requirements\" from pre-emption does not suggest that no other \"requirements\" exist. The Riegels also invoke \u00a7 360h(d), which provides that compliance with certain FDA orders \"shall not relieve any person from liability under Federal or State law.\" This indicates that some state-law claims are not pre-empted, as we held in <i>Lohr.</i> But it could not possibly mean that <i>all</i> state-law claims are not pre-empted, since that would deprive the MDA pre-emption clause of all content. And it provides no guidance as to which state-law claims are pre-empted and which are not.</p>\n<p>[5]  Contrary to Justice STEVENS' contention, <i>post,</i> at 1012, we do not \"advance\" this argument. We merely suggest that if one were to speculate upon congressional purposes, the best evidence for that would be found in the statute.</p>\n<p>[6]  The opinions joined by these five Justices dispose of the Riegels' assertion that <i>Lohr</i> held common-law duties were too general to qualify as duties \"with respect to a device.\" The majority opinion in <i>Lohr</i> also disavowed this conclusion, for it stated that the Court did \"not believe that [the MDA's] statutory and regulatory language necessarily precludes ... `general' state requirements from ever being pre-empted....\" <i>Medtronic, Inc. v.

Juries apply rules, but do not make them. And while a jury's finding of liability may induce a defendant to alter its device or its label, this does not render the finding a \"requirement\" within the meaning of the MDA. \"A requirement is a rule of law that must be obeyed; an event, such as a jury verdict, that merely motivates an optional decision is not a requirement.\" <i>Bates v.

It is for that reason that the MDA does not grant \"a single state jury\" any power whatsoever to set any standard that either conforms with or differs from a relevant federal standard. I do not agree with the colorful but inaccurate quotation on page 12 of the Court's opinion.</p>\n<p>[2]  See <i>Cipollone v.

See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Herman v. Smith, Kline &amp; French Labs.,</i> 286 F.Supp. 694 (ED Wis.1968). See also <i>infra,</i> at 1019, n. 16 (decisions after 1976).</p>\n<p>[12]  See Leflar &amp; Adler, The Preemption Pentad: Federal Preemption of Products Liability Claims After <i>Medtronic,</i> 64 Tenn. L.Rev. 691, 704, n. 71 (1997) (\"Surely a furor would have been aroused by the very suggestion that ... medical devices should receive an exemption from products liability litigation while new drugs, subject to similar regulatory scrutiny from the same agency, should remain under the standard tort law regime.\"); Porter, The <i>Lohr</i> Decision: FDA Perspective and Position, 52 Food &amp; Drug L.J. 7, 11 (1997) (With preemption, the \"FDA's regulation of devices would have been accorded an entirely different weight in private tort litigation than its counterpart regulation of drugs and biologics. This disparity is neither justified nor appropriate, nor does the agency believe it was intended by Congress ....\").</p>\n<p>[13]  The Drug Amendments of 1962 reiterated Congress' intent not to preempt claims relying on state law: \"Nothing in the amendments... shall be construed as invalidating any provision of State law which would be valid in the absence of such amendments unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such amendments and such provision of State law.\" \u00a7 202, 76 Stat. 793.</p>\n<p>[14]  Congress featured California's regulatory system in its discussion of \u00a7 360k(a), but it also identified California's system as a prime candidate for an exemption from preemption under \u00a7 360k(b). \"[R]equirements imposed under the California statute,\" the House Report noted, \"serve as an example of requirements that the Secretary should authorize to be continued (provided any application submitted by a State meets requirements pursuant to the reported bill).\" H.R.Rep. No. 94-853, p. 46. Thus Congress sought not to terminate all state premarket approval systems, but rather to place those systems under the controlling authority of the FDA.</p>\n<p>[15]  The process for approving a new drug begins with preclinical laboratory and animal testing. The sponsor of the new drug then submits an investigational new drug application seeking FDA approval to test the drug on humans. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(i); 21 CFR \u00a7 312.1 <i>et seq.</i> (2007). Clinical trials generally proceed in three phases involving successively larger groups of patients: 20 to 80 subjects in phase I; no more than several hundred subjects in phase II; and several hundred to several thousand subjects in phase III. 21 CFR \u00a7 312.21. After completing the clinical trials, the sponsor files a new drug application containing, <i>inter alia,</i> \"full reports of investigations\" showing whether the \"drug is safe for use and ... effective\"; the drug's composition; a description of the drug's manufacturing, processing, and packaging; and the proposed labeling for the drug. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(b)(1).</p>\n<p>[16]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tobin v.
