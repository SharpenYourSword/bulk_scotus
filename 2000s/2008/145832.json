Diamond, Counsel of Record, Deputy County Attorney, Jean Burdorf, Assistant County Attorney, Office of the Hennepin County Attorney, Minneapolis, MN, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>New constitutional rules announced by this Court that place certain kinds of primary individual conduct beyond the power of the States to proscribe, as well as \"watershed\" rules of criminal procedure, must be applied in all future trials, all cases pending on direct review, and all federal habeas corpus proceedings. All other new rules of criminal procedure must be applied in future trials and in cases pending on direct review, but may not provide the basis for a federal collateral attack on a state-court conviction. This is the substance of the \"<i>Teague</i> rule\" described by Justice O'Connor in her plurality opinion in <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).<sup>[1]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1033</span> The question in this case is whether <i>Teague</i> constrains the authority of state courts to give broader effect to new rules of criminal procedure than is required by that opinion. We have never suggested that it does, and now hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 1996 a Minnesota jury found petitioner Stephen Danforth guilty of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor. See Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.342, subd. 1(a) (1994). The 6-year-old victim did not testify at trial, but the jury saw and heard a videotaped interview of the child. On appeal from his conviction, Danforth argued that the tape's admission violated the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" Applying the rule of admissibility set forth in <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), the Minnesota Court of Appeals concluded that the tape \"was sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence,\" and affirmed the conviction. <i>State v. Danforth,</i> 573 N.W.2d 369, 375 (1997). The conviction became final in 1998 when the Minnesota Supreme Court denied review and petitioner's time for filing a writ of certiorari elapsed. See <i>Caspari v. Bohlen,</i> 510 U.S. 383, 390, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994).</p>\n<p>After petitioner's conviction had become final, we announced a \"new rule\" for evaluating the reliability of testimonial statements in criminal cases. In <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), we held that where testimonial statements are at issue, \"the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\"</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, petitioner filed a state postconviction petition, in which he argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the admission of the taped interview violated the rule announced in <i>Crawford.</i> Applying the standards set forth in <i>Teague,</i> the Minnesota trial court and the Minnesota Court of Appeals concluded that <i>Crawford</i> did not apply to petitioner's case. The State Supreme Court granted review to consider two arguments: (1) that the lower courts erred in holding that <i>Crawford</i> did not apply retroactively under <i>Teague;</i> and (2) that the state court was \"free to apply a broader retroactivity standard than that of <i>Teague,</i>\" and should apply the <i>Crawford</i> rule to petitioner's case even if federal law did not require it to do so. 718 N.W.2d 451, 455 (2006). The court rejected both arguments. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to the second, the Minnesota court held that our decisions in <i>Michigan v. Payne,</i> 412 U.S. 47, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736 (1973), <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S. 167, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 110 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990), and <i>Teague</i> itself establish that state courts are not free to give a Supreme Court decision announcing a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure broader retroactive application than that given by this Court.<sup>[2]</sup> The Minnesota Court acknowledged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1034</span> that other state courts had held that <i>Teague</i> does not apply to state postconviction proceedings,<sup>[3]</sup> but concluded that \"we are not free to fashion our own standard of retroactivity for <i>Crawford.</i>\" 718 N.W.2d, at 455-457.</p>\n<p>Our recent decision in <i>Whorton v. Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007), makes clear that the Minnesota court correctly concluded that federal law does not <i>require</i> state courts to apply the holding in <i>Crawford</i> to cases that were final when that case was decided. Nevertheless, we granted certiorari, 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2427, 167 L.Ed.2d 1129 (2007), to consider whether <i>Teague</i> or any other federal rule of law <i>prohibits</i> them from doing so.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin with a comment on the source of the \"new rule\" announced in <i>Crawford.</i> For much of our Nation's history, federal constitutional rights\u0097such as the Sixth Amendment confrontation right at issue in <i>Crawford</i>\u0097were not binding on the States. Federal law, in fact, imposed no constraints on the procedures that state courts could or should follow in imposing criminal sanctions on their citizens. Neither the Federal Constitution as originally ratified nor any of the Amendments added by the Bill of Rights in 1791 gave this Court or any other federal-court power to review the fairness of state criminal procedures. Moreover, before 1867 the statutory authority of federal district courts to issue writs of habeas corpus did not extend to convicted criminals in state custody. See Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, \u00a7 1, 14 Stat. 385.</p>\n<p>The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment radically changed the federal courts' relationship with state courts. That Amendment, one of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments ratified in 1868, is the source of this Court's power to decide whether a defendant in a state proceeding received a fair trial\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> whether his deprivation of liberty was \"without due process of law.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1 (\"[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\"). In construing that Amendment, we have held that it imposes minimum standards of fairness on the States, and requires state criminal trials to provide defendants with protections \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" <i>Palko v. Connecticut,</i> 302 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1035</span> U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937).</p>\n<p>Slowly at first, and then at an accelerating pace in the 1950's and 1960's, the Court held that safeguards afforded by the Bill of Rights\u0097including a defendant's Sixth Amendment right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him\"\u0097are incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and are therefore binding upon the States. See <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963) (applying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the States); <i>Pointer v. Texas,</i> 380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) (holding that \"the Sixth Amendment's right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is likewise a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment\"). Our interpretation of that basic Sixth Amendment right of confrontation has evolved over the years.</p>\n<p>In <i>Crawford</i> we accepted the petitioner's argument that the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation that we had previously endorsed in <i>Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, needed reconsideration because it \"stray[ed] from the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause.\" 541 U.S., at 42, 124 S.Ct. 1354. We \"turn[ed] to the historical background of the Clause to understand its meaning,\" <i>id.,</i> at 43, 124 S.Ct. 1354, and relied primarily on legal developments that had occurred prior to the adoption of the Sixth Amendment to derive the correct interpretation. <i>Id.,</i> at 43-50, 124 S.Ct. 1354. We held that the \"Constitution prescribes a procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less than the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of our own devising.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 67, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p>Thus, our opinion in <i>Crawford</i> announced a \"new rule\"\u0097as that term is defined in <i>Teague</i>\u0097because the result in that case \"was not <i>dictated</i> by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final,\" <i>Teague,</i> 489 U.S., at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). It was not, however, a rule \"of our own devising\" or the product of our own views about sound policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Our decision today must also be understood against the backdrop of our somewhat confused and confusing \"retroactivity\" cases decided in the years between 1965 and 1987. Indeed, we note at the outset that the very word \"retroactivity\" is misleading because it speaks in temporal terms. \"Retroactivity\" suggests that when we declare that a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is \"nonretroactive,\" we are implying that the right at issue was not in existence prior to the date the \"new rule\" was announced. But this is incorrect. As we have already explained, the source of a \"new rule\" is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law. Accordingly, the underlying right necessarily pre-exists our articulation of the new rule. What we are actually determining when we assess the \"retroactivity\" of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1036</span> Originally, criminal defendants whose convictions were final were entitled to federal habeas relief only if the court that rendered the judgment under which they were in custody lacked jurisdiction to do so. <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> 3 Pet. 193, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830); <i>Ex parte Lange,</i> 18 Wall. 163, 176, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1874); <i>Ex parte Siebold,</i> 100 U.S. 371, 376-377, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880).<sup>[6]</sup> In 1915, the realm of violations for which federal habeas relief would be available to state prisoners was expanded to include state proceedings that \"deprive[d] the accused of his life or liberty without due process of law.\" <i>Frank v. Mangum,</i> 237 U.S. 309, 335, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969 (1915). In the early 1900's, however, such relief was only granted when the constitutional violation was so serious that it effectively rendered the conviction void for lack of jurisdiction. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Moore v. Dempsey,</i> 261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543 (1923) (mob domination of a trial); <i>Mooney v. Holohan,</i> 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935) <i>(per curiam)</i> (knowing use of perjured testimony by the prosecution); <i>Waley v. Johnston,</i> 316 U.S. 101, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942) <i>(per curiam)</i> (coerced guilty plea).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The serial incorporation of the Amendments in the Bill of Rights during the 1950's and 1960's imposed more constitutional obligations on the States and created more opportunity for claims that individuals were being convicted without due process and held in violation of the Constitution. Nevertheless, until 1965 the Court continued to construe every constitutional error, including newly announced ones, as entitling state prisoners to relief on federal habeas. \"New\" constitutional rules of criminal procedure were, without discussion or analysis, routinely applied to cases on habeas review. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Jackson v. Denno,</i> 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964); <i>Gideon,</i> 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; <i>Eskridge v. Washington Bd. of Prison Terms and Paroles,</i> 357 U.S. 214, 78 S.Ct. 1061, 2 L.Ed.2d 1269 (1958) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>In <i>Linkletter v. Walker,</i> 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), the Court expressly considered the issue of \"retroactivity\" for the first time. Adopting a practical approach, we held that the retroactive effect of each new rule should be determined on a case-by-case basis by examining the purpose of the rule, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1037</span> reliance of the States on the prior law, and the effect on the administration of justice of retroactive application of the rule. <i>Id.,</i> at 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731. Applying those considerations to the exclusionary rule announced in <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), we held that the <i>Mapp</i> rule would not be given retroactive effect; it would not, in other words, be applied to convictions that were final before the date of the <i>Mapp</i> decision.<sup>[8]</sup><i>Linkletter,</i> 381 U.S., at 636-640, 85 S.Ct. 1731.</p>\n<p>During the next four years, application of the <i>Linkletter</i> standard produced strikingly divergent results. As Justice Harlan pointed out in his classic dissent in <i>Desist v. United States,</i> 394 U.S. 244, 257, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969), one new rule was applied to all cases subject to direct review, <i>Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott,</i> 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966); another to all cases in which trials had not yet commenced, <i>Johnson v. New Jersey,</i> 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966); another to all cases in which tainted evidence had not yet been introduced at trial, <i>Fuller v. Alaska,</i> 393 U.S. 80, 89 S.Ct. 61, 21 L.Ed.2d 212 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>;</i> and still others only to the party involved in the case in which the new rule was announced and to all future cases in which the proscribed official conduct had not yet occurred, <i>Stovall v. Denno,</i> 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); <i>DeStefano v. Woods,</i> 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> He reasonably questioned whether such decisions \"may properly be considered the legitimate products of a court of law, rather than the commands of a super-legislature.\" 394 U.S., at 259, 89 S.Ct. 1030.</p>\n<p>Justice Harlan's dissent in <i>Desist,</i> buttressed by his even more searching separate opinion in <i>Mackey v. United States,</i> 401 U.S. 667, 675, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971) (opinion concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part), and scholarly criticism,<sup>[9]</sup> laid the groundwork for the eventual demise of the <i>Linkletter</i> standard. In <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987), the Court rejected as \"unprincipled and inequitable,\" the application of the <i>Linkletter</i> standard to cases pending on direct review. In <i>Teague,</i> Justice O'Connor reaffirmed <i>Griffith'</i>s rejection of the <i>Linkletter</i> standard for determining the \"retroactive\" applicability of new rules to state convictions that were not yet final and rejected the <i>Linkletter</i> standard for cases pending on federal habeas review. She adopted (with a significant modification) the approach advocated by Justice Harlan for federal collateral review of final state judgments.</p>\n<p>Justice O'Connor endorsed a general rule of nonretroactivity for cases on collateral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1038</span> review, stating that \"[u]nless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\" 489 U.S., at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). The opinion defined two exceptions: rules that render types of primary conduct \"`beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060, and \"watershed\" rules that \"implicate the fundamental fairness of the trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 311, 312, 313, 109 S.Ct. 1060.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>It is clear that <i>Linkletter</i> and then <i>Teague</i> considered what constitutional violations may be remedied on federal habeas.<sup>[11]</sup> They did not define the scope of the \"new\" constitutional rights themselves. Nor, as we shall explain, did <i>Linkletter</i> or <i>Teague</i> (or any of the other cases relied upon by respondent and the Minnesota Supreme Court) speak to the entirely separate question whether States can provide remedies for violations of these rights in their own postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Neither <i>Linkletter</i> nor <i>Teague</i> explicitly or implicitly constrained the authority of the States to provide remedies for a broader range of constitutional violations than are redressable on federal habeas. <i>Linkletter</i> spoke in broad terms about the retroactive applicability of new rules to state convictions that had become final prior to our announcement of the rules. Although <i>Linkletter</i> arose on federal habeas, the opinion did not rely on that procedural posture as a factor in its holding or analysis. Arguably, therefore, the approach it established might have been applied with equal force to both federal and state courts reviewing final state convictions. But we did not state\u0097and the state courts did not conclude\u0097that <i>Linkletter</i> imposed such a limitation on the States.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>A year after deciding <i>Linkletter,</i> we granted certiorari in <i>Johnson</i> to address the retroactivity of the rules announced in <i>Escobedo v. Illinois,</i> 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), and <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Applying the standard announced in <i>Linkletter,</i> we held that those rules should be applied only to trials that began after the respective dates of those decisions; they were given no retroactive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1039</span> effect beyond the parties in <i>Miranda</i> and <i>Escobedo</i> themselves.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Notably, the Oregon Supreme Court decided to give retroactive effect to <i>Escobedo</i> despite our holding in <i>Johnson.</i> In <i>State v. Fair,</i> 263 Ore. 383, 502 P.2d 1150 (1972), the Oregon court noted that it was continuing to apply <i>Escobedo</i> retroactively and correctly stated that \"we are free to choose the degree of retroactivity or prospectivity which we believe appropriate to the particular rule under consideration, so long as we give federal constitutional rights at least as broad a scope as the United States Supreme Court requires.\" 263 Ore., at 387-388, 502 P.2d, at 1152. In so holding, the Oregon court cited our language in <i>Johnson</i> that \"`States are still entirely free to effectuate under their own law stricter standards than those we have laid down and to apply those standards in a broader range of cases than is required by this decision.'\" 263 Ore., at 386, 502 P.2d, at 1151 (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 384 U.S., at 733, 86 S.Ct. 1772).<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Like <i>Linkletter, Teague</i> arose on federal habeas. Unlike in <i>Linkletter,</i> however, this procedural posture was not merely a background fact in <i>Teague.</i> A close reading of the <i>Teague</i> opinion makes clear that the rule it established was tailored to the unique context of federal habeas and therefore had no bearing on whether States could provide broader relief in their own postconviction proceedings than required by that opinion. Because the case before us now does not involve either of the \"<i>Teague</i> exceptions,\" it is Justice O'Connor's discussion of the general rule of nonretroactivity that merits the following three comments.</p>\n<p>First, not a word in Justice O'Connor's discussion\u0097or in either of the opinions of Justice Harlan that provided the blueprint for her entire analysis\u0097asserts or even intimates that her definition of the class eligible for relief under a new rule should inhibit the authority of any state agency or state court to extend the benefit of a new rule to a broader class than she defined.</p>\n<p>Second, Justice O'Connor's opinion clearly indicates that <i>Teague</i>'s general rule of nonretroactivity was an exercise of this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1040</span> Court's power to interpret the federal habeas statute. Chapter 153 of Title 28 of the U.S.Code gives federal courts the authority to grant \"writs of habeas corpus,\" but leaves unresolved many important questions about the scope of available relief. This Court has interpreted that congressional silence\u0097along with the statute's command to dispose of habeas petitions \"as law and justice require,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243\u0097as an authorization to adjust the scope of the writ in accordance with equitable and prudential considerations. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Brecht v. Abrahamson,</i> 507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (harmless-error standard); <i>McCleskey v. Zant,</i> 499 U.S. 467, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991) (abuse-of-the-writ bar to relief); <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) (procedural default); <i>Stone v. Powell,</i> 428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976) (cognizability of Fourth Amendment claims). <i>Teague</i> is plainly grounded in this authority, as the opinion expressly situated the rule it announced in this line of cases adjusting the scope of federal habeas relief in accordance with equitable and prudential considerations. 489 U.S., at 308, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion) (citing, <i>inter alia, Wainwright</i> and <i>Stone</i>).<sup>[15]</sup> Since <i>Teague</i> is based on statutory authority that extends only to federal courts applying a federal statute, it cannot be read as imposing a binding obligation on state courts.</p>\n<p>Third, the text and reasoning of Justice O'Connor's opinion also illustrate that the rule was meant to apply only to federal courts considering habeas corpus petitions challenging state-court criminal convictions. Justice O'Connor made numerous references to the \"Great writ\" and the \"writ,\" and expressly stated that \"[t]he relevant frame of reference\" for determining the appropriate retroactivity rule is defined by \"the purposes for which the writ of habeas corpus is made available.\" 489 U.S., at 306, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). Moreover, she justified the general rule of nonretroactivity in part by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1041</span> reference to comity and respect for the finality of state convictions. Federalism and comity considerations are unique to <i>federal</i> habeas review of state convictions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v. Preciose,</i> 129 N.J. 451, 475, 609 A.2d 1280, 1292 (1992) (explaining that comity and federalism concerns \"simply do not apply when this Court reviews procedural rulings by our lower courts\"). If anything, considerations of comity militate in favor of allowing state courts to grant habeas relief to a broader class of individuals than is required by <i>Teague.</i> And while finality is, of course, implicated in the context of state as well as federal habeas, finality of state convictions is a <i>state</i> interest, not a federal one. It is a matter that States should be free to evaluate, and weigh the importance of, when prisoners held in state custody are seeking a remedy for a violation of federal rights by their lower courts.</p>\n<p>The dissent correctly points out that <i>Teague</i> was also grounded in concerns over uniformity and the inequity inherent in the <i>Linkletter</i> approach. There is, of course, a federal interest in \"reducing the inequity of haphazard retroactivity standards and disuniformity in the application of federal law.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1053. This interest in uniformity, however, does not outweigh the general principle that States are independent sovereigns with plenary authority to make and enforce their own laws as long as they do not infringe on federal constitutional guarantees. The fundamental interest in federalism that allows individual States to define crimes, punishments, rules of evidence, and rules of criminal and civil procedure in a variety of different ways\u0097so long as they do not violate the Federal Constitution\u0097is not otherwise limited by any general, undefined federal interest in uniformity. Nonuniformity is, in fact, an unavoidable reality in a federalist system of government. Any State could surely have adopted the rule of evidence defined in <i>Crawford</i> under state law even if that case had never been decided. It should be equally free to give its citizens the benefit of our rule in any fashion that does not offend federal law.</p>\n<p>It is thus abundantly clear that the <i>Teague</i> rule of non-retroactivity was fashioned to achieve the goals of federal habeas while minimizing federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings. It was intended to limit the authority of federal courts to overturn state convictions\u0097not to limit a state court's authority to grant relief for violations of new rules of constitutional law when reviewing its own State's convictions.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Our subsequent cases, which characterize the <i>Teague</i> rule as a standard limiting only the scope of <i>federal</i> habeas relief, confirm that <i>Teague</i> speaks only to the context of federal habeas. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beard v. Banks,</i> 542 U.S. 406, 412, 124 S.Ct. 2504, 159 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004) (\"<i>Teague</i>'s nonretroactivity principle acts as a limitation on the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief to state prisoners\" (internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and brackets omitted)); <i>Caspari,</i> 510 U.S., at 389, 114 S.Ct. 948 (\"The <i>[Teague]</i> nonretroactivity principle <i>prevents</i> a federal court from granting habeas corpus relief to a state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1042</span> prisoner based on a rule announced after his conviction and sentence became final\").</p>\n<p>It is also noteworthy that for many years following <i>Teague,</i> state courts almost universally understood the <i>Teague</i> rule as binding only federal habeas courts, not state courts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cowell v. Leapley,</i> 458 N.W.2d 514 (S.D.1990); <i>Preciose,</i> 129 N.J. 451, 609 A.2d 1280; <i>State ex rel. Schmelzer v. Murphy,</i> 201 Wis.2d 246, 256-257, 548 N.W.2d 45, 49 (1996) (choosing of its own volition to adopt the <i>Teague</i> rule); but see <i>State v. Egelhoff,</i> 272 Mont. 114, 900 P.2d 260 (1995).<sup>[17]</sup> Commentators were similarly confident that <i>Teague</i>'s \"restrictions appl[ied] only to federal habeas cases,\" leaving States free to \"determine whether to follow the federal courts' rulings on retroactivity or to fashion rules which respond to the unique concerns of that state.\" Hutton, Retroactivity in the States: The Impact of <i>Teague v. Lane</i> on State Postconviction Remedies, 44 Ala. L.Rev. 421, 423-424, 422-423 (1993).</p>\n<p>In sum, the <i>Teague</i> decision limits the kinds of constitutional violations that will entitle an individual to relief on federal habeas, but does not in any way limit the authority of a state court, when reviewing its own state criminal convictions, to provide a remedy for a violation that is deemed \"nonretroactive\" under <i>Teague.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The State contends that two of our prior decisions\u0097<i>Michigan v. Payne</i> and <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith</i>\u0097cast doubt on state courts' authority to provide broader remedies for federal constitutional violations than mandated by <i>Teague.</i> We disagree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Michigan v. Payne,</i> 412 U.S. 47, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736, we considered the retroactivity of the rule prohibiting \"vindictive\" resentencing that had been announced in our opinion in <i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 723-726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969).<sup>[18]</sup> Relying on the approach set forth in <i>Linkletter</i> and <i>Stovall,</i> we held that the <i>Pearce</i> rule did not apply because Payne's resentencing had occurred prior to <i>Pearce</i>'s date of decision.<sup>[19]</sup> We therefore reversed the judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court, which had applied <i>Pearce</i> retroactively, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>At first blush the fact that we reversed the judgment of the Michigan court appears to lend support to the view that state courts may not give greater retroactive effect to new rules announced by this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1043</span> Court than we expressly authorize. But, as our opinion in <i>Payne</i> noted, the Michigan Supreme Court had applied the <i>Pearce</i> rule retroactively \"`pending clarification'\" by this Court. 412 U.S., at 49, 93 S.Ct. 1966. As the Michigan Court explained, it had applied the new rule in the case before it in order to give guidance to Michigan trial courts concerning what it regarded as an ambiguity in <i>Pearce</i>'s new rule.<sup>[20]</sup> The Michigan Court did not purport to make a definitive ruling on the retroactivity of <i>Pearce;</i> nor did it purport to apply a broader state rule of retroactivity than required by federal law. Our opinion in <i>Payne</i> did not require the Michigan Supreme Court to modify its disposition of the case; it simply remanded for further proceedings after providing the clarification that the Michigan Court sought. Most significantly, other than the fact that the case was remanded for further proceedings, not a word in our <i>Payne</i> opinion suggests that the Court intended to prohibit state courts from applying new constitutional standards in a broader range of cases than we require.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>Notably, at least some state courts continued, after <i>Payne,</i> to adopt and apply broader standards of retroactivity than required by our decisions. In <i>Pennsylvania v. McCormick,</i> 359 Pa.Super. 461, 470, 519 A.2d 442, 447 (1986), for example, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania chose not to follow this Court's nonretroactivity holding in <i>Allen v. Hardy,</i> 478 U.S. 255, 106 S.Ct. 2878, 92 L.Ed.2d 199 (1986) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> The Pennsylvania court correctly explained that our decision was \"not binding authority [in part] because neither the federal nor the state constitution dictate which decisions must be given retroactive effect.\" 359 Pa.Super., at 470, 519 A.2d, at 447.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S. 167, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 110 L.Ed.2d 148, petitioners challenged the constitutionality of an Arkansas statute enacted in 1983 that imposed a discriminatory burden on interstate truckers. While their suit was pending, this Court declared a virtually identical Pennsylvania tax unconstitutional. See <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner,</i> 483 U.S. 266, 107 S.Ct. 2829, 97 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987). Shortly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1044</span> thereafter, the Arkansas Supreme Court struck down the Arkansas tax at issue. The primary issue in <i>Smith</i> was whether petitioners were entitled to a refund of taxes that were assessed before the date of our decision in <i>Scheiner.</i></p>\n<p>The Arkansas Court held that petitioners were not entitled to a refund because our decision in <i>Scheiner</i> did not apply retroactively. Four Members of this Court agreed. The plurality opinion concluded that federal law did not provide petitioners with a right to a refund of pre-<i>Scheiner</i> tax payments because <i>Scheiner</i> did not apply retroactively to invalidate the Arkansas tax prior to its date of decision. Four Members of this Court dissented. The dissenting opinion argued that the case actually raised both the substantive question whether the tax violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution and the remedial question whether, if so, the petitioners were entitled to a refund. The dissent concluded as a matter of federal law that the tax was invalid during the years before <i>Scheiner,</i> and that petitioners were entitled to a decision to that effect. Whether petitioners should get a refund, however, the dissent deemed a mixed question of state and federal law that should be decided by the state court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA concurred with the plurality's judgment because he disagreed with the substantive rule announced in <i>Scheiner,</i> but he did not agree with the plurality's reasoning. After stating that his views on retroactivity diverged from the plurality's \"in a fundamental way,\" Justice SCALIA explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I share [the dissent's] perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role, which is to say what the law is, not to prescribe what [the law] shall be. The very framing of the issue that we purport to decide to-day \u0097whether our decision in <i>Scheiner</i> shall `apply' retroactively\u0097presupposes a view of our decisions as <i>creating</i> the law, as opposed to <i>declaring</i> what the law already is. Such a view is contrary to that understanding of `the judicial Power,' U.S. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 1, which is not only the common and traditional one, but which is the only one that can justify courts in denying force and effect to the unconstitutional enactments of duly elected legislatures, see <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137[, 2 L.Ed. 60] (1803)\u0097the very exercise of judicial power asserted in <i>Scheiner.</i> To hold a governmental Act to be unconstitutional is not to announce that <i>we</i> forbid it, but that the <i>Constitution</i> forbids it; and when, as in this case, the constitutionality of a state statute is placed in issue, the question is not whether some decision of ours `applies' in the way that a law applies; the question is whether the Constitution, as interpreted in that decision, invalidates the statute. Since the Constitution does not change from year to year; since it does not conform to our decisions, but our decisions are supposed to conform to it; the notion that our interpretation of the Constitution in a particular decision could take prospective form does not make sense. Either enforcement of the statute at issue in <i>Scheiner</i> (which occurred before our decision there) was unconstitutional, or it was not; if it was, then so is enforcement of all identical statutes in other States, whether occurring before or after our decision; and if it was not, then <i>Scheiner</i> was wrong, and the issue of whether to `apply' that decision needs no further attention.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323.</blockquote>\n<p>Because Justice SCALIA's vote rested on his disagreement with the substantive rule announced in <i>Scheiner</i>\u0097rather than with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1045</span> the retroactivity analysis in the dissenting opinion\u0097there were actually five votes supporting the dissent's views on the retroactivity issue. Accordingly, it is the dissent rather than the plurality that should inform our analysis of the issue before us today.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, several years later, a majority of this Court explicitly adopted the <i>Smith</i> dissent's reasoning in <i>Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> 509 U.S. 86, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). <i>Harper,</i> like <i>Smith,</i> involved a request for a refund of taxes paid before we declared a similar Michigan tax unconstitutional. We held that the Virginia tax at issue in <i>Harper</i> was in fact invalid\u0097even before we declared the similar tax unconstitutional\u0097 but that this did not necessarily entitle the petitioners to a full refund. We explained that the Constitution required Virginia to \"`provide relief consistent with federal due process principles,'\" 509 U.S., at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (citing <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 181, 110 S.Ct. 2323), but that \"`a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination'\" under the due process clause, 509 U.S., at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (citing <i>McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation,</i> 496 U.S. 18, 39-40, 110 S.Ct. 2238, 110 L.Ed.2d 17 (1990)). We left to the \"Virginia courts this question of state law and the performance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any appropriate remedy.\" 509 U.S., at 102, 113 S.Ct. 2510. And we specifically noted that Virginia \"`is free to choose which form of relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal requirements we have outlined.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>McKesson,</i> 496 U.S., at 51-52, 110 S.Ct. 2238); see also 509 U.S., at 102, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (\"State law may provide relief beyond the demands of federal due process, but under no circumstances may it confine petitioners to a lesser remedy\" citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Thus, to the extent that these civil retroactivity decisions are relevant to the issue before us today,<sup>[23]</sup> they support our conclusion that the remedy a state court chooses to provide its citizens for violations of the Federal Constitution is primarily a question of state law. Federal law simply \"sets certain minimum requirements that States must meet but may exceed in providing appropriate relief.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 178-179, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (plurality opinion). They provide no support for the proposition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1046</span> federal law places a limit on state authority to provide remedies for federal constitutional violations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>Finally, while the State acknowledges that it may grant its citizens broader protection than the Federal Constitution requires by enacting appropriate legislation or by judicial interpretation of its own Constitution, it argues that it may not do so by judicial misconstruction of federal law. <i>Oregon v. Hass,</i> 420 U.S. 714, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 43 L.Ed.2d 570 (1975)\u0097like our early decisions in <i>Ableman v. Booth,</i> 21 How. 506, 16 L.Ed. 169 (1859), and <i>Tarble's Case,</i> 13 Wall. 397, 20 L.Ed. 597 (1872)\u0097provides solid support for that proposition. But the States that give broader retroactive effect to this Court's new rules of criminal procedure do not do so by misconstruing the federal <i>Teague</i> standard. Rather, they have developed <i>state</i> law to govern retroactivity in state postconviction proceedings. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v. Whitfield,</i> 107 S.W.3d 253, 268 (Mo.2003) (\"[A]s a matter of state law, this Court chooses not to adopt the <i>Teague</i> analysis ...\"). The issue in this case is whether there is a federal rule, either implicitly announced in <i>Teague,</i> or in some other source of federal law, that prohibits them from doing so.</p>\n<p>The absence of any precedent for the claim that <i>Teague</i> limits state collateral review courts' authority to provide remedies for federal constitutional violations is a sufficient reason for concluding that there is no such rule of federal law. That conclusion is confirmed by several additional considerations. First, if there is such a federal rule of law, presumably the Supremacy Clause in Article V of the Federal Constitution would require all state entities\u0097not just state judges\u0097to comply with it. We have held that States can waive a <i>Teague</i> defense, during the course of litigation, by expressly choosing not to rely on it, see <i>Collins v. Youngblood,</i> 497 U.S. 37, 41, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990), or by failing to raise it in a timely manner, see <i>Schiro v. Farley,</i> 510 U.S. 222, 228-229, 114 S.Ct. 783, 127 L.Ed.2d 47 (1994). It would indeed be anomalous to hold that state legislatures and executives are not bound by <i>Teague,</i> but that state courts are.</p>\n<p>Second, the State has not identified, and we cannot discern, the source of our authority to promulgate such a novel rule of federal law. While we have ample authority to control the administration of justice in the federal courts\u0097particularly in their enforcement of federal legislation\u0097we have no comparable supervisory authority over the work of state judges. <i>Johnson v. Fankell,</i> 520 U.S. 911, 117 S.Ct. 1800, 138 L.Ed.2d 108 (1997). And while there are federal interests that occasionally justify this Court's development of common-law rules of federal law,<sup>[24]</sup> our normal role is to interpret law created by others and \"not to prescribe what it shall be.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Just as constitutional doubt may tip the scales in favor of one construction of a statute rather than another, so does uncertainty about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1047</span> the source of authority to impose a federal limit on the power of state judges to remedy wrongful state convictions outweigh any possible policy arguments favoring the rule that respondent espouses.</p>\n<p>Finally, the dissent contends that the \"end result [of this opinion] is startling\" because \"two criminal defendants, each of whom committed the same crime, at the same time, whose convictions became final on the same day, and each of whom raised an identical claim at the same time under the Federal Constitution\" could obtain different results. <i>Post,</i> at 1047. This assertion ignores the fact that the two hypothetical criminal defendants did not actually commit the \"same crime.\" They violated different state laws, were tried in and by different state sovereigns, and may\u0097for many reasons\u0097be subject to different penalties. As previously noted, such nonuniformity is a necessary consequence of a federalist system of government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that our jurisprudence concerning the \"retroactivity\" of \"new rules\" of constitutional law is primarily concerned, not with the question whether a constitutional violation occurred, but with the availability or nonavailability of remedies. The former is a \"pure question of federal law, our resolution of which should be applied uniformly throughout the Nation, while the latter is a mixed question of state and federal law.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 205, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>A decision by this Court that a new rule does not apply retroactively under <i>Teague</i> does not imply that there was no right and thus no violation of that right at the time of trial\u0097only that no remedy will be provided in federal habeas courts. It is fully consistent with a government of laws to recognize that the finality of a judgment may bar relief. It would be quite wrong to assume, however, that the question whether constitutional violations occurred in trials conducted before a certain date depends on how much time was required to complete the appellate process.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. As was true in <i>Michigan v. Payne</i><i>,</i> the Minnesota Court is free to reinstate its judgment disposing of the petition for state postconviction relief.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Some of our new rulings on the meaning of the United States Constitution apply retroactively\u0097to cases already concluded\u0097and some do not. This Court has held that the question whether a particular ruling is retroactive is itself a question of federal law. It is basic that when it comes to any such question of federal law, it is \"the province and duty\" of this Court \"to say what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). State courts are the final arbiters of their own state law; this Court is the final arbiter of federal law. State courts are therefore bound by our rulings on whether our cases construing federal law are retroactive.</p>\n<p>The majority contravenes these bedrock propositions. The end result is startling: Of two criminal defendants, each of whom committed the same crime, at the same time, whose convictions became final on the same day, and each of whom raised an identical claim at the same time under the Federal Constitution, one may be executed while the other is set free\u0097the first despite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> being correct on his claim, and the second because of it. That result is contrary to the Supremacy Clause and the Framers' decision to vest in \"one supreme Court\" the responsibility and authority to ensure the uniformity of federal law. Because the Constitution requires us to be more jealous of that responsibility and authority, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>One year after <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989)\u0097our leading modern precedent on retroactivity\u0097<i>Teague</i>'s author explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The determination whether a constitutional decision of this Court is retroactive... is a matter of federal law. When questions of state law are at issue, state courts generally have the authority to determine the retroactivity of their own decisions. The retroactive applicability of a constitutional decision of this Court, however, `is every bit as much of a federal question as what particular federal constitutional provisions themselves mean, what they guarantee, and whether they have been denied.'\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S. 167, 177-178, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 110 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.) (quoting <i>Chapman v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 21, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>For that reason, \"we have consistently required that state courts adhere to our retroactivity decisions.\" 496 U.S., at 178, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (citing <i>Michigan v. Payne,</i> 412 U.S. 47, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736 (1973), and <i>Arsenault v. Massachusetts,</i> 393 U.S. 5, 89 S.Ct. 35, 21 L.Ed.2d 5 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i>). Even more recently, we held that the \"Supremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law.\" <i>Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> 509 U.S. 86, 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Indeed, about the only point on which our retroactivity jurisprudence has been consistent is that the retroactivity of new federal rules is a question of federal law binding on States. The Court's contrary holding is based on a misreading of our precedent and a misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity generally.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As the Court correctly points out, before 1965 we took for granted the proposition that all federal constitutional rights, including rights that represented a break from earlier precedent, would be given full retroactive effect on both direct and collateral review. That all changed with <i>Linkletter v. Walker,</i> 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). In that case, a Louisiana prisoner brought a federal habeas petition arguing that illegally seized evidence was introduced against him at trial in violation of <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). <i>Mapp,</i> however, had been decided after his conviction became final. We granted certiorari to decide whether the <i>Mapp</i> rule \"operates retrospectively upon cases finally decided in the period prior to <i>Mapp.</i>\" 381 U.S., at 619-620, 85 S.Ct. 1731. In answering this question, we broke from our past practice of assuming full retroactivity, holding that \"we are neither required to apply, nor prohibited from applying, a decision retrospectively.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731. Our analysis turned entirely on the nature and scope of the particular constitutional right at issue: \"[W]e must ... weigh the merits and demerits [of retroactive application] in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Under this framework, we held that <i>Mapp</i> would apply only prospectively. 381 U.S., at 639-640, 85 S.Ct. 1731.</p>\n<p>The next year, we decided <i>Johnson v. New Jersey,</i> 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). <i>Johnson</i> was a direct appeal from the New Jersey Supreme Court's denial of <i>state</i> collateral relief. The precise question in <i>Johnson</i> was whether the rules announced in <i>Escobedo v. Illinois,</i> 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), and <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), would apply to state prisoners whose convictions had become final before those cases were decided. In holding that <i>Escobedo</i> and <i>Miranda</i> should apply only prospectively, 384 U.S., at 732, 86 S.Ct. 1772, we imported <i>Linkletter</i>'s mode of retroactivity analysis into review of state postconviction proceedings, 384 U.S., at 726-727, 86 S.Ct. 1772. Finally, in <i>Stovall v. Denno,</i> 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), we announced that, for purposes of retroactivity analysis, \"no distinction is justified between convictions now final, as in the instant case, and convictions at various stages of trial and direct review.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 300, 87 S.Ct. 1967.</p>\n<p>Thus, by 1967, the <i>Linkletter</i> analysis was applied in review of criminal convictions, whether final or not. No matter at what stage of proceedings this Court considered a retroactivity question, the issue was decided with reference to the purposes and practical impact of the precise federal right in question: \"Each constitutional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own background of precedent, and its own impact on the administration of justice, and the way in which these factors combine [to decide the retroactivity issue] must inevitably vary with the [constitutional] dictate involved.\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 728, 86 S.Ct. 1772.</p>\n<p>Because the question of retroactivity was so tied up with the nature and purpose of the underlying federal constitutional right, it would have been surprising if any of our cases had suggested that States were free to apply new rules of federal constitutional law retroactively even when we would not. As one of the more thoughtful legal scholars put it in discussing the effect of the <i>Linkletter</i> analysis on state collateral review, \"[i]f a state gave relief in such a case on the exclusive authority of <i>Mapp,</i> under the rationale of the <i>Linkletter</i> opinion it would presumably have been reversed.\" Mishkin, Foreword: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L.Rev. 56, 91, n. 132 (1965).</p>\n<p>Our precedents made clear that States could give greater substantive protection under their own laws than was available under federal law, and could give whatever retroactive effect to <i>those</i> laws they wished. As the Court explained in <i>Johnson,</i> \"[o]f course, States are still entirely free to effectuate under their own law stricter standards than those we have laid down and to apply those standards in a broader range of cases than is required by this decision.\" 384 U.S., at 733, 86 S.Ct. 1772. The clear implication of this statement was that States could apply their own retroactivity rules only to new substantive rights \"under their own law,\" not to new federal rules announced by this Court.</p>\n<p>Thus, contrary to the Court's view, our early retroactivity cases nowhere suggested that the retroactivity of new federal constitutional rules of criminal procedure was anything other than \"a matter of federal law.\" <i>Daniel v. Louisiana,</i> 420 U.S. 31, 32, 95 S.Ct. 704, 42 L.Ed.2d 790 (1975) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> It is no surprise, then, that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> when we held that a particular right would not apply retroactively, the language in our opinions did not indicate that our decisions were optional. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Fuller v. Alaska,</i> 393 U.S. 80, 81, 89 S.Ct. 61, 21 L.Ed.2d 212 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i> (the rule announced in <i>Lee v. Florida,</i> 392 U.S. 378, 88 S.Ct. 2096, 20 L.Ed.2d 1166 (1968), \"<i>is to be applied</i> only to trials in which the evidence is sought to be introduced after the date of [that] decision\" (emphasis added)). And, of course, when we found that a state court erred in holding that a particular right should not apply retroactively, the state court was bound to comply. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Kitchens v. Smith,</i> 401 U.S. 847, 91 S.Ct. 1089, 28 L.Ed.2d 519 (1971) <i>(per curiam)</i>; <i>McConnell v. Rhay,</i> 393 U.S. 2, 3-4, 89 S.Ct. 32, 21 L.Ed.2d 2 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i>; <i>Arsenault v. Massachusetts,</i> 393 U.S. 5, 6, 89 S.Ct. 35, 21 L.Ed.2d 5 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Although nothing in our decisions suggested that state courts could determine the retroactivity of new federal rules according to their own lights, we had no opportunity to confront the issue head on until <i>Michigan v. Payne,</i> 412 U.S. 47, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736 (1973).<sup>[1]</sup> In <i>Payne,</i> the defendant had argued before the Michigan Supreme Court that his resentencing violated the rule we had announced in <i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). In considering this question, the state court noted that this Court had \"not yet decided whether <i>Pearce</i> is to be applied retroactively.\" <i>People v. Payne,</i> 386 Mich. 84, 90, n. 3, 191 N.W.2d 375, 378, n. 2 (1971). Nevertheless, without so much as citing any federal retroactivity precedent, the court decided that it would \"apply <i>Pearce</i> in the present case in order to instruct our trial courts as to the Michigan interpretation of an ambiguous portion of <i>Pearce</i> ..., pending clarification by the United States Supreme Court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 91, n. 3, 191 N.W.2d 375, 191 N.W.2d, at 378, n. 2.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in <i>Payne</i> only on the question of retroactivity, and decided that <i>Pearce</i> should not apply retroactively. In reversing the contrary decision of the state court, our language was not equivocal: \"Since the resentencing hearing in this case took place approximately two years before <i>Pearce</i> was decided, we hold that the Michigan Supreme Court erred in applying its proscriptions here.\" 412 U.S., at 57, 93 S.Ct. 1966.</p>\n<p>The majority argues that <i>Payne</i> did not preclude States from applying retroactivity rules different from those we announced; rather, the argument goes, the Michigan Supreme Court simply elected to follow the federal retroactivity rule, \"pending clarification.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1042-1044. That is certainly a possible reading of <i>Payne,</i> but not the most plausible one. The Michigan Supreme Court did not purport to rest its decision to apply <i>Pearce</i> retroactively on the federal <i>Linkletter</i> analysis, and this Court's reversal is most reasonably read as <i>requiring</i> state courts to apply our federal retroactivity decisions. Notably, this is not the first time Members of this Court have debated the meaning of <i>Payne,</i> with <i>Teague</i>'s author explaining that <i>Payne</i> supports the proposition that \"we have consistently required that state courts adhere to our retroactivity decisions,\" <i>American Trucking,</i> 496 U.S., at 178, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.), and the author of today's opinion disagreeing in dissent, see <i>id.,</i> at 210, n. 4, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But whichever way <i>Payne</i> is read, it either offers no support for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1051</span> majority's position, because the state court simply applied federal retroactivity rules, or flatly rejects the majority's position, because the state court failed to apply federal retroactivity rules, and was told by this Court that it must.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Justice Harlan had begun dissenting in our retroactivity cases, pressing the view that new rules announced by the Court should be applied in all cases not yet final, without regard to the analysis set forth in <i>Linkletter.</i> See <i>Desist v. United States,</i> 394 U.S. 244, 256-269, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); <i>Mackey v. United States,</i> 401 U.S. 667, 675-702, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971) (opinion concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part). In <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987), we abandoned <i>Linkletter</i> as it applied to cases still on direct review and adopted Justice Harlan's view in such cases. Noting that nonretroactivity on direct appeal \"violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" and that \"selective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated defendants the same,\" 479 U.S., at 322, 323, 107 S.Ct. 708, we held that \"a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, <i>state or federal,</i> pending on direct review or not yet final,\" <i>id.,</i> at 328, 107 S.Ct. 708 (emphasis added). Just as in previous cases, <i>Griffith</i> by its terms bound state courts to apply our retroactivity decisions.</p>\n<p>Two years after <i>Griffith</i> was decided, we granted certiorari in <i>Yates v. Aiken,</i> 484 U.S. 211, 108 S.Ct. 534, 98 L.Ed.2d 546 (1988). In that case, a South Carolina state habeas court had decided that our decision in <i>Francis v. Franklin,</i> 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985), should not be applied retroactively. If the authority of state courts to apply their own retroactivity rules were well established under our precedents\u0097as the majority would have it, see <i>ante,</i> at 1035-1039\u0097 this case should have been easily decided on the ground that whatever the federal retroactivity rule, the State could adopt its own rule on the retroactivity of newly announced federal constitutional standards.</p>\n<p>Instead, the State argued to this Court \"that we should adopt Justice Harlan's theory that a newly announced constitutional rule should not be applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review unless\" the rule meets certain criteria\u0097 the flip side of Justice Harlan's view about cases on direct review that we had accepted in <i>Griffith.</i> 484 U.S., at 215, 108 S.Ct. 534. Under that approach, the State argued, <i>Francis</i> would not be applied retroactively on collateral review. 484 U.S., at 215, 108 S.Ct. 534. In response, we discussed Justice Harlan's \"distinction between direct review and collateral review.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We found, however, that it was \"not necessary to determine whether we should... adopt Justice Harlan's reasoning as to the retroactivity of cases announcing new constitutional rules to cases pending on collateral review,\" <i>id.,</i> at 215-216, 108 S.Ct. 534, because <i>Francis</i> did not announce a new rule.</p>\n<p>This Court went on, however, to address South Carolina's alternative argument\u0097 that it \"has the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings,\" which would allow it in the case before the Court \"to refuse to apply a new rule of federal constitutional law retroactively in such a proceeding.\" 484 U.S., at 217, 108 S.Ct. 534. This argument should sound familiar\u0097whatever the federal retroactivity rule, a State may establish its own retroactivity rule for its own collateral proceedings. This Court rejected that proposition, not only because it did not regard <i>Francis</i> as a new rule, but also because the state court did not \"plac[e] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1052</span> any limit on the issues that it will entertain in collateral proceedings.\" 484 U.S., at 218, 108 S.Ct. 534. As this Court explained, if the state court \"consider[s] the merits of the federal claim, it has a duty to grant the relief that <i>federal law</i> requires.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Given all this, the present case should come out the way it does only if <i>Teague</i> changed the nature of retroactivity as a creature of federal law binding on the States, and adopted the argument rejected in <i>Yates</i>\u0097that when it comes to retroactivity, a State \"has the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings.\" <i>Teague</i> did no such thing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In <i>Teague,</i> we completed the project of conforming our view on the retroactivity of new rules of criminal procedure to those of Justice Harlan. Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion posed the problem by noting, with more than a bit of understatement, that the \"<i>Linkletter</i> retroactivity standard has not led to consistent results.\" 489 U.S., at 302, 109 S.Ct. 1060. In light of these concerns, and because of \"`the important distinction between direct review and collateral review,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 307, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (quoting <i>Yates, supra,</i> at 215, 108 S.Ct. 534), we generally adopted Justice Harlan's approach to retroactivity on collateral review, 489 U.S., at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, just as we had previously adopted his approach on direct review in <i>Griffith.</i></p>\n<p>The <i>Linkletter</i> approach to retroactivity was thus overruled in favor of the Harlan approach in two steps: <i>Griffith</i> and <i>Teague.</i> There is no dispute that <i>Griffith</i> is fully binding on States; a new rule \"is to be applied retroactively to all cases, <i>state or federal,</i> pending on direct review or not yet final.\" 479 U.S., at 328, 107 S.Ct. 708 (emphasis added). <i>Teague</i> is simply the other side of the coin, and it too should be binding in \"all cases, state or federal.\" The fact that <i>Linkletter</i> was overruled in two stages rather than one should not lead to a different result.</p>\n<p>Indeed, <i>Teague</i> did not purport to distinguish between federal and state collateral review. Justice O'Connor's opinion noted that \"in <i>Yates v. Aiken</i><i>,</i> we were asked to decide whether the rule announced in <i>Francis v. Franklin</i><i>,</i> should be applied to a defendant on collateral review at the time that case was decided,\" but that we were able to decide the case on alternative grounds. 489 U.S., at 307, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (citations omitted). This citation of <i>Yates</i>\u0097a state habeas case\u0097makes clear that <i>Teague</i> contemplated no difference between retroactivity of new federal rules in state and federal collateral proceedings. Thus, our unqualified holding\u0097 that \"[u]nless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced,\" 489 U.S., at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060\u0097is enough to decide this case.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the reasons the <i>Teague</i> Court provided for adopting Justice Harlan's view apply to state as well as federal collateral review. The majority is quite right that <i>Teague</i> invoked the interest in comity between the state and federal sovereigns. <i>Id.,</i> at 308, 109 S.Ct. 1060. But contrary to the impression conveyed by the majority, there was more to <i>Teague</i> than that. <i>Teague</i> also relied on the interest in finality: \"Application of constitutional rules not in existence at the time a conviction became final seriously undermines the principle of finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system. Without finality, the criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 309, 109 S.Ct. 1060. The Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1053</span> responds by flatly stating that \"finality of state convictions is a <i>state</i> interest, not a federal one.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1040-1041. But while it is certainly true that finality of state convictions is a state interest, that does mean it is not also a federal one. After all, our decision in <i>Griffith</i> made finality the touchstone for retroactivity of new federal rules, and bound States to that judgment. See 479 U.S., at 328, 107 S.Ct. 708 (new rules are \"to be applied retroactively to all cases, <i>state or federal,</i> pending on direct review or not yet final\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>It is quite a radical proposition to assert that this Court has nothing to say about an interest \"essential to the operation of our criminal justice system,\" without which \"the criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect,\" when the question is whether this interest is being undermined by the very rules of <i>federal</i> constitutional procedure that we are charged with expounding. A State alone may \"evaluate, and weigh the importance of\" finality interests, <i>ante,</i> at 1040-1041, when it decides which substantive rules of criminal procedure <i>state law</i> affords; it is quite a leap to hold, as the Court does, that they alone can do so in the name of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p><i>Teague</i> was also based on the inequity of the <i>Linkletter</i> approach to retroactivity. After noting that the disparate treatment of similarly situated defendants led us in <i>Griffith</i> to adopt Justice Harlan's view for cases on direct appeal, the Court then explained that the \"<i>Linkletter</i> standard also led to unfortunate disparity in the treatment of similarly situated defendants on collateral review.\" 489 U.S., at 305, 109 S.Ct. 1060. See also <i>id.,</i> at 316, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (the Court's new approach to retroactivity \"avoids the inequity resulting from the uneven application of new rules to similarly situated defendants\").</p>\n<p>This interest in reducing the inequity of haphazard retroactivity standards and disuniformity in the application of federal law is quite plainly a predominantly federal interest. Indeed, it was one of the main reasons we cited in <i>Griffith</i> for imposing a uniform rule of retroactivity upon <i>state</i> courts for cases on direct appeal. And, more to the point, it is the very interest that animates the Supremacy Clause and our role as the \"one supreme Court\" charged with enforcing it.</p>\n<p>Justice Story, writing for the Court, noted nearly two centuries ago that the Constitution requires \"<i>uniformity</i> of decisions throughout the whole United States, upon all subjects within [its] purview.\" <i>Martin v. Hunter's Lessee,</i> 1 Wheat. 304, 347-348, 4 L.Ed. 97 (1816). Indeed, the \"fundamental principle\" of our Constitution, as Justice O'Connor once put it, is \"that a single sovereign's law should be applied equally to all.\" Our Judicial Federalism, 35 Case W. Res. L.Rev. 1, 4 (1985). States are free to announce their own state-law rules of criminal procedure, and to apply them retroactively in whatever manner they like. That is fully consistent with the principle that \"a single sovereign's law should be applied equally to all.\" But the Court's opinion invites just the sort of disuniformity in federal law that the Supremacy Clause was meant to prevent. The same determination of a federal constitutional violation at the same stage in the criminal process can result in freedom in one State and loss of liberty or life in a neighboring State.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court's opinion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1054</span> allows \"a single sovereign's law\"\u0097the Federal Constitution, as interpreted by this Court\u0097to be applied differently in every one of the several States.</p>\n<p>Finally, from <i>Linkletter</i> through <i>Johnson</i> to <i>Teague,</i> we have always emphasized that determining whether a new federal right is retroactive turns on the nature of the substantive federal rule at issue. See <i>Linkletter,</i> 381 U.S., at 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731 (in deciding retroactivity, we \"loo[k] to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation\"); <i>Johnson,</i> 384 U.S., at 728, 86 S.Ct. 1772 (\"Each constitutional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own background of precedent, and its own impact on the administration of justice, and the way in which these factors combine [to decide the retroactivity issue] must inevitably vary with the dictate involved\"); <i>Teague, supra,</i> at 311-315, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (deciding whether rule is applicable to cases on collateral review turns on whether the rule \"places `certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,'\" and whether the rule is an \"absolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness that is `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty'\"). That is how we determine retroactivity \u0097by carefully examining the underlying federal right. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Whorton v. Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1181-1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007); <i>Schriro v. Summerlin,</i> 542 U.S. 348, 353-354, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004); <i>Sawyer v. Smith,</i> 497 U.S. 227, 243-245, 110 S.Ct. 2822, 111 L.Ed.2d 193 (1990); <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 318-319, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989).</p>\n<p>When this Court decides that a particular right shall not be applied retroactively, but a state court finds that it should, it is at least in part because of a different assessment by the state court of the nature of the underlying federal right\u0097 something on which the Constitution gives this Court the final say. The nature and scope of the new rules we announce directly determines whether they will be applied retroactively on collateral review. Today's opinion stands for the unfounded proposition that while we alone have the final say in expounding the former, we have no control over the latter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Court's holding is not only based on a misreading of our retroactivity cases, but also on a misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity generally. The majority's decision is grounded on the erroneous view that retroactivity is a remedial question. See <i>ante,</i> at 1046-1047 (\"It is important to keep in mind that our jurisprudence concerning the `retroactivity' of `new rules' of constitutional law is primarily concerned, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1055</span> not with the question whether a constitutional violation occurred, but with the availability or nonavailability of remedies\"). But as explained in the lead opinion in <i>American Trucking</i>\u0097penned by the author of the lead opinion in <i>Teague</i>\u0097it is an \"error\" to \"equat[e] a decision not to apply a rule retroactively with the judicial choice of a remedy.\" 496 U.S., at 194, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.). As Justice O'Connor went on to emphasize, \"[n]or do this Court's retroactivity decisions, whether in the civil or criminal sphere, support the ... assertion that our retroactivity doctrine is a remedial principle.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"While application of the principles of retroactivity may have remedial effects, they are not themselves remedial principles .... A decision defining the operative conduct or events that will be adjudicated under old law does not, in itself, specify an appropriate remedy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 195, 110 S.Ct. 2323. See also <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</i> 411 U.S. 192, 199, 93 S.Ct. 1463, 36 L.Ed.2d 151 (1973) (plurality opinion) (describing the question of retroactivity as \"whether we will apply a new constitutional rule of criminal law in reviewing judgments of conviction obtained under a prior standard,\" and contrasting this with the question of the \"appropriate scope of federal equitable remedies\").</p>\n<p>In other words, when we ask whether and to what extent a rule will be retroactively applied, we are asking what law\u0097 new or old\u0097will apply. As we have expressly noted, \"[t]he <i>Teague</i> doctrine ... does not involve a special `remedial' limitation on the principle of `retroactivity' as much as it reflects a limitation inherent in the principle itself.\" <i>Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde,</i> 514 U.S. 749, 758, 115 S.Ct. 1745, 131 L.Ed.2d 820 (1995).</p>\n<p>The foregoing prompts a lengthy rejoinder from the Court, to the effect that it is wrong to view retroactivity as a federal choice-of-law question rather than a remedial one. That view, we are told, was rejected by five Justices in <i>American Trucking</i> and then by the Court in <i>Harper. Ante,</i> at 1043-1046. But the proposition on which five Members of the Court agreed in <i>American Trucking,</i> and that the Court adopted in <i>Harper,</i> was that the <i>Griffith</i> rule of retroactivity\u0097that is, that newly announced constitutional decisions should apply to all cases on direct review\u0097should apply to civil cases as well as criminal. See <i>American Trucking,</i> 496 U.S., at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"I share Justice STEVENS' perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role, which is to say what the law is, not to prescribe what it shall be\"); <i>id.,</i> at 212, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"Fundamental notions of fairness and legal process dictate that the same rules should be applied to all similar cases on direct review\"); <i>Harper,</i> 509 U.S., at 97, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (\"When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review\").</p>\n<p>Neither Justice SCALIA's concurrence in <i>American Trucking</i> combined with the dissent, nor the Court's opinion in <i>Harper,</i> resolved that retroactivity was a remedial question. That is why, the year after <i>American Trucking</i> was decided, two of the Justices in today's majority could explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Since the question is whether the court should apply the old rule or the new one, retroactivity is properly seen in the first instance as a matter of choice of law, `a choice ... between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward.' <i>Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co.,</i> 287 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1056</span> 358, 364, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360 (1932). Once a rule is found to apply `backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, <i>i.e.,</i> whether the party prevailing under a new rule should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the rule had been an old one. Subject to possible constitutional thresholds, the remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where the case originates in state court. See <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S. 167, 210, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 110 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). <i>But the antecedent choice-of-law question is a federal one where the rule at issue itself derives from federal law, constitutional or otherwise.</i> See <i>Smith, supra,</i> at 177-178[, 110 S.Ct. 2323] (plurality opinion).\" <i>James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia,</i> 501 U.S. 529, 534-535, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991) (opinion of SOUTER, J., joined by STEVENS, J.) (citation omitted; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>And <i>Harper</i> certainly did not view the retroactivity of federal rules as a remedial question for state courts. Quite the contrary: <i>Harper</i> held that the \"Supremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law,\" 509 U.S., at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (citation omitted), and expressly treated retroactivity and remedy as separate questions, <i>id.,</i> at 100-102, 113 S.Ct. 2510.</p>\n<p>The majority explains that when we announce a new rule of law, we are not \"`<i>creating</i> the law,'\" but rather \"`<i>declaring</i> what the law already is.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1044 (quoting <i>American Trucking, supra,</i> at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)). But this has nothing to do with the question before us. The point may lead to the conclusion that nonretroactivity of our decisions is improper\u0097 the position the Court has adopted in both criminal and civil cases on direct review\u0097 but everyone agrees that full retroactivity is not required on collateral review. It necessarily follows that we must choose whether \"new\" or \"old\" law applies to a particular category of cases. Suppose, for example, that a defendant, whose conviction became final before we announced our decision in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), argues (correctly) on collateral review that he was convicted in violation of both <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), the case that <i>Crawford</i> overruled. Under our decision in <i>Whorton v. Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007), the \"new\" rule announced in <i>Crawford</i> would not apply retroactively to the defendant. But I take it to be uncontroversial that the defendant would nevertheless get the benefit of the \"old\" rule of <i>Roberts,</i> even under the view that the rule not only is but always has been an incorrect reading of the Constitution. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Yates,</i> 484 U.S., at 218, 108 S.Ct. 534. Thus, the question whether a particular federal rule will apply retroactively is, in a very real way, a choice between new and old law. The issue in this case is who should decide.</p>\n<p>The proposition that the question of retroactivity\u0097that is, the choice between new or old law in a particular case\u0097is distinct from the question of remedies has several important implications for this case. To begin with, whatever intuitive appeal may lie in the majority's statement that \"the remedy a state court chooses to provide its citizens for violations of the Federal Constitution is primarily a question of state law,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1045, the statement misses the mark. The relevant inquiry is not about remedy; it is about choice of law\u0097 new or old. There is no reason to believe, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1057</span> either legally or intuitively, that States should have any authority over this question when it comes to which <i>federal</i> constitutional rules of criminal procedure to apply.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, when the question is what federal rule of decision from this Court should apply to a particular case, no Court but this one\u0097which has the ultimate authority \"to say what the law is,\" <i>Marbury,</i> 1 Cranch, at 177, 2 L.Ed. 60\u0097should have final say over the answer. See <i>Harper, supra,</i> at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (\"Supremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law\" (citation omitted)). This is enough to rebut the proposition that there is no \"source of [our] authority\" to bind state courts to follow our retroactivity decisions. <i>Ante,</i> at 1046-1047. Retroactivity is a question of federal law, and our final authority to construe it cannot, at this point in the Nation's history, be reasonably doubted.</p>\n<p>Principles of federalism protect the prerogative of States to extend greater rights under their own laws than are available under federal law. The question here, however, is the availability of protection under the Federal Constitution\u0097specifically, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. It is no intrusion on the prerogatives of the States to recognize that it is for this Court to decide such a question of federal law, and that our decision is binding on the States under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p>Consider the flip side of the question before us today: If a State interprets its own constitution to provide protection beyond that available under the Federal Constitution, and has ruled that this interpretation is not retroactive, no one would suppose that a federal court could hold otherwise, and grant relief under state law that a state court would refuse to grant. The result should be the same when a state court is asked to give retroactive effect to a right under the Federal Constitution that this Court has held is not retroactive.</p>\n<p>The distinction between retroactivity and available remedies highlights the fact that the majority's assertion \"that <i>Teague</i>'s general rule of nonretroactivity was an exercise of this Court's power to interpret the federal habeas statute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1039-1040\u0097even if correct\u0097is neither here nor there.<sup>[4]</sup> While Congress has substantial control over federal courts' ability to grant relief for violations of the Federal Constitution, the Constitution gives us the responsibility to decide what its provisions mean. And with that responsibility necessarily comes the authority to determine the scope of those provisions\u0097when they apply and when they do not.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1058</span> This proposition\u0097and the importance of the distinction between retroactivity and available remedies\u0097were confirmed when we considered the availability of federal collateral review of state convictions under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Whatever control Congress has over federal courts' ability to grant postconviction remedies, the availability or scope of those remedies has no bearing on our decisions about whether new or old law should apply in a particular case. That is why, after AEDPA's passage, we view the <i>Teague</i> inquiry as distinct from that under AEDPA. See <i>Horn v. Banks,</i> 536 U.S. 266, 272, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"While it is of course a necessary prerequisite to federal habeas relief that a prisoner satisfy the AEDPA standard of review set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), ... none of our post-AEDPA cases have suggested that a writ of habeas corpus should automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies the AEDPA standard, or that AEDPA relieves courts from the responsibility of addressing properly raised <i>Teague</i> arguments\"). The majority today views the issue as simply one of what remedies a State chooses to apply; our cases confirm that the question whether a federal decision is retroactive is one of federal law distinct from the issue of available remedies.</p>\n<p>Lurking behind today's decision is of course the question of just how free state courts are to define the retroactivity of our decisions interpreting the Federal Constitution. I do not see any basis in the majority's logic for concluding that States are free to hold our decisions retroactive when we have held they are not, but not free to hold that they are not when we have held they are. Under the majority's reasoning, in either case the availability of relief in state court is a question for those courts to evaluate independently. The majority carefully reserves that question, see <i>ante,</i> at 1034, n. 4, confirming that the majority regards it as open.</p>\n<p>Nor is there anything in today's decision suggesting that States could not adopt more nuanced approaches to retroactivity. For example, suppose we hold that the Sixth Amendment right to be represented by particular counsel of choice, recently announced in <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,</i> 548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006), is a new rule that does not apply retroactively. Under the majority's rationale, a state court could decide that it nonetheless will apply <i>Gonzalez-Lopez</i> retroactively, but only if the defendant could prove prejudice, or some other criterion we had rejected as irrelevant in defining the substantive right. Under the majority's logic, that would not be a misapplication of our decision in <i>Gonzalez-Lopez</i>\u0097which specifically rejected any required showing of prejudice, <i>id.,</i> at 147-148, 126 S.Ct. 2557\u0097but simply a state decision on the scope of available remedies in state court. The possible permutations\u0097from State to State, and federal right to federal right\u0097are endless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Perhaps all this will be dismissed as fine parsing of somewhat arcane precedents, over which reasonable judges may disagree. Fair enough; but I would hope that enough has been said at least to refute the majority's assertion that its conclusion is dictated by our prior cases. This dissent is compelled not simply by disagreement over how to read those cases, but by the fundamental issues at stake\u0097our role under the Constitution as the final arbiter of federal law, both as to its meaning and its reach, and the accompanying duty to ensure the uniformity of that federal law.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1059</span> Stephen Danforth's conviction became final before the new rule in <i>Crawford</i> was announced. In <i>Whorton v. Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007), we held that <i>Crawford</i> shall not be applied retroactively on collateral review. That should be the end of the matter. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although <i>Teague</i> was a plurality opinion that drew support from only four Members of the Court, the <i>Teague</i> rule was affirmed and applied by a majority of the Court shortly thereafter. See <i>Penry v. Lynaugh,</i> 492 U.S. 302, 313, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) (\"Because Penry is before us on collateral review, we must determine, as a threshold matter, whether granting him the relief he seeks would create a new rule. Under <i>Teague,</i> new rules will not be applied or announced in cases on collateral review unless they fall into one of two exceptions\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>[2]  The relevant passage in the Minnesota Supreme Court opinion states:\n</p>\n<p>\"Danforth argues that <i>Teague</i> dictates the limits of retroactive application of new rules only in <i>federal</i> habeas corpus proceedings and does not limit the retroactive application of new rules in <i>state</i> postconviction proceedings. Danforth is incorrect when he asserts that state courts are free to give a Supreme Court decision of federal constitutional criminal procedure broader retroactive application than that given by the Supreme Court. ... In light of <i>Payne</i> and <i>American Trucking Associations,</i> we cannot apply state retroactivity principles when determining the retroactivity of a new rule of federal constitutional criminal procedure if the Supreme Court has already provided relevant federal principles.\" 718 N.W.2d 451, 456 (2006).</p>\n<p>[3]  See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Daniels v. State,</i> 561 N.E.2d 487, 489 (Ind.1990); <i>State ex rel. Taylor v. Whitley,</i> 606 So.2d 1292, 1296-1297 (La. 1992); <i>State v. Whitfield,</i> 107 S.W.3d 253, 266-268 (Mo. 2003); <i>Colwell v. State,</i> 118 Nev. 807, 816-819, 59 P.3d 463, 470-471 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Cowell v. Leapley,</i> 458 N.W.2d 514, 517-518 (S.D.1990).</p>\n<p>[4]  We note at the outset that this case does not present the questions whether States are required to apply \"watershed\" rules in state post-conviction proceedings, whether the <i>Teague</i> rule applies to cases brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000 ed., Supp. V), or whether Congress can alter the rules of retroactivity by statute. Accordingly, we express no opinion on these issues.</p>\n<p>[5]  It may, therefore, make more sense to speak in terms of the \"redressability\" of violations of new rules, rather than the \"retroactivity\" of such rules. Cf. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S. 167, 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 110 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"The very framing of the issue that we purport to decide today\u0097 whether our decision in [<i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner,</i> 483 U.S. 266, 107 S.Ct. 2829, 97 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987),] shall `apply' retroactively\u0097presupposes [an incorrect] view of our decisions as <i>creating</i> the law, as opposed to <i>declaring</i> what the law already is\"). Unfortunately, it would likely create, rather than alleviate, confusion to change our terminology at this point. Accordingly, we will continue to utilize the existing vocabulary, despite its shortcomings.</p>\n<p>[6]  Although our post-1867 cases reflected a \"softening\" of the concept of jurisdiction to embrace claims that the statute under which the petitioner had been convicted was unconstitutional or that the detention was based on an illegally imposed sentence, the Court adhered to the basic rule that habeas was unavailable to review claims of constitutional error that did not go to the trial court's jurisdiction. See Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L.Rev. 441, 471, 483-484 (1963); Hart, The Supreme Court 1958 Term, Foreword: The Time Chart of the Justices, 73 Harv. L.Rev. 84, 103-104 (1959).</p>\n<p>[7]  \"[I]n <i>Waley v. Johnston,</i> 316 U.S. 101, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942), the Court openly discarded the concept of jurisdiction\u0097 by then more [of] a fiction than anything else\u0097as a touchstone of the availability of federal habeas review, and acknowledged that such review is available for claims of disregard of the constitutional rights of the accused....\" <i>Wainwright v. Sykes,</i> 433 U.S. 72, 79, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[8]  <i>Linkletter</i> arose in the context of a denial of federal habeas relief, so its holding was \"necessarily limited to convictions which had become final by the time <i>Mapp</i> ... [was] rendered.\" <i>Johnson v. New Jersey,</i> 384 U.S. 719, 732, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). We noted in <i>Linkletter</i> that <i>Mapp</i> was being applied to cases that were still pending on direct review at the time it was decided, so the issue before us was expressly limited to \"whether the exclusionary principle enunciated in <i>Mapp</i> applies to state court convictions which had become final before rendition of our opinion.\" 381 U.S., at 622, 85 S.Ct. 1731 (footnote omitted). Shortly thereafter, however, we held that the three-pronged <i>Linkletter</i> analysis should be applied both to convictions that were final before rendition of our opinions and to cases that were still pending on direct review. See <i>Johnson,</i> 384 U.S., at 732, 86 S.Ct. 1772; <i>Stovall v. Denno,</i> 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967).</p>\n<p>[9]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Haddad, \"Retroactivity Should be Rethought\": A Call for the End of the Linkletter Doctrine, 60 J.Crim. L., C. &amp; P.S. 417 (1969).</p>\n<p>[10]  Rules of the former type \"are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subject to <i>[Teague</i>'s] bar.\" <i>Schriro v. Summerlin,</i> 542 U.S. 348, 352, n. 4, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004).</p>\n<p>[11]  Similarly, <i>Johnson,</i> and <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987), defined the scope of constitutional violations that would be remedied on direct appeal.</p>\n<p>[12]  The dissent is correct that at least one \"thoughtful legal scholar\" believed that <i>Linkletter</i> did preclude States from applying new constitutional rules more broadly than our cases required. <i>Post,</i> at 4 (citing Mishkin, Foreword: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L.Rev. 56, 91, n. 132 (1965)). Notably, this comment was made in the context of an attack on <i>Linkletter</i>'s prospective approach as inconsistent with the idea that judges are \"bound by a body of fixed, overriding law.\" Mishkin, 79 Harv. L.Rev., at 62. Moreover, the footnote cited by the dissent concludes with a statement that \"the reservation to the states of the power to apply [new rules] to all convictions, ... is ... the preferable pattern.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 91, n. 132, 85 S.Ct. 1731. In all events, even if <i>Linkletter</i> and its progeny rested on the assumption that \"new rules\" of constitutional law did not exist until announced by this Court, that view of the law was rejected when we endorsed Justice Harlan's analysis of retroactivity.</p>\n<p>[13]  That same year, we similarly denied retroactive effect to the rule announced in <i>Griffin v. California,</i> 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), prohibiting prosecutorial comment on the defendant's failure to testify. See <i>Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott,</i> 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966). Shortly thereafter, in a case involving a <i>Griffin</i> error, we held for the first time that there are some constitutional errors that do not require the automatic reversal of a conviction. <i>Chapman v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 22, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Both <i>Shott</i> and <i>Chapman</i> protected the State of California from a potentially massive exodus of state prisoners because their prosecutors and judges had routinely commented on a defendant's failure to testify.</p>\n<p>[14]  Although the plain meaning of this language in <i>Johnson</i> is that a state creating its own substantive standards can be as generous with their retroactive effect as it wishes, courts and commentators both before and after <i>Teague v. Lane</i><i>,</i> 489 U.S. 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), cited this language in support of the proposition that state courts \"may apply new constitutional standards `in a broader range of cases than is required' by th[is] Court's decision not to apply the standards retroactively.\" <i>Colwell v. State,</i> 118 Nev. 807, 818, 59 P.3d 463, 470-471 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>;</i> see also Stith, A Contrast of State and Federal Court Authority to Grant Habeas Relief, 38 Val. U.L.Rev. 421, 443 (2004). Thirty years after deciding <i>State v. Fair</i><i>,</i> the Oregon Supreme Court \"disavowed\" this analysis based on our decisions in <i>Oregon v. Hass,</i> 420 U.S. 714, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 43 L.Ed.2d 570 (1975), and <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S. 167, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 110 L.Ed.2d 148. <i>Page v. Palmateer,</i> 336 Ore. 379, 84 P.3d 133 (2004). As we explain <i>infra,</i> at 1042-1044, its reliance on those cases was misplaced, and its decision to change course was therefore misguided.</p>\n<p>[15]  Subsequent decisions have characterized <i>Teague</i> in a similar fashion. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Brecht,</i> 507 U.S., at 633, 634, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (stating that \"in defining the scope of the writ, we look first to the considerations underlying our habeas jurisprudence,\" and identifying <i>Teague</i> as an example). And individual Justices have been even more explicit. See <i>Day v. McDonough,</i> 547 U.S. 198, 214, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (describing, <i>inter alia,</i> the <i>Teague</i> rule as having been \"created by the habeas courts themselves, in the exercise of their traditional equitable discretion ... because [it was] seen as necessary to protect the interests of comity and finality that federal collateral review of state criminal proceedings necessarily implicates\"); <i>Withrow v. Williams,</i> 507 U.S. 680, 699, 113 S.Ct. 1745, 123 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (listing <i>Teague</i> as one illustration of the principle that \"federal courts exercising their habeas powers may refuse to grant relief on certain claims because of `prudential concerns' such as equity and federalism\"); 507 U.S., at 718, 113 S.Ct. 1745 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (stating that <i>Teague</i> and other \"gateways through which a habeas petitioner must pass before proceeding to the merits of a constitutional claim\" are \"grounded in the equitable discretion of habeas courts\" (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); <i>Teague,</i> 489 U.S., at 317, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (characterizing <i>Teague</i> as a decision \"construing the reach of the habeas corpus statutes\" and contrasting it with <i>Griffith,</i> which \"appear[s] to have constitutional underpinnings\"); 489 U.S., at 332-333, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (characterizing <i>Teague</i> as an unwarranted change in \"[this Court's] interpretation of the federal habeas statute\"); see also <i>Mackey v. United States,</i> 401 U.S. 667, 684, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part) (describing the problem of retroactivity as \"a problem as to the scope of the habeas writ\").</p>\n<p>[16]  The lower federal courts have also applied the <i>Teague</i> rule to motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a federal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000 ed., Supp. V). Much of the reasoning applicable to applications for writs of habeas corpus filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 seems equally applicable in the context of \u00a7 2255 motions. See <i>United States v. Hayman,</i> 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952) (explaining that \u00a7 2255 was enacted as a functional equivalent for habeas corpus to allow federal prisoners to bring a collateral attack in the court that imposed the sentence rather than a court that happened to be near the prison).</p>\n<p>[17]  Today, the majority of state courts still read <i>Teague</i> this way. As far as we can tell, only three States\u0097Minnesota, Oregon, and Montana\u0097have adopted a contrary view. See <i>Page,</i> 336 Ore. 379, 84 P.3d 133; <i>Egelhoff,</i> 272 Mont. 114, 900 P.2d 260.</p>\n<p>[18]  In <i>Pearce,</i> we held:\n</p>\n<p>\"[W]henever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal.\" 395 U.S., at 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072.</p>\n<p>As the concurrence pointed out, some States already provided equivalent or broader protection against vindictive sentencing. See <i>id.,</i> at 733-734, n. 4, 89 S.Ct. 2072 (opinion of Douglas, J.).</p>\n<p>[19]  Given the fact that Payne's appeal was still pending on that date, however, the result would have been different and the views of the dissenting Justices would have prevailed if the case had been decided after our decision in <i>Teague.</i></p>\n<p>[20]  The relevant footnote in the Michigan Supreme Court's opinion explained:\n</p>\n<p>\"The United States Supreme Court has not yet decided whether <i>Pearce</i> is to be applied retroactively. Although the Court twice granted certiorari to consider the question, in each case the writ was subsequently dismissed as improvidently granted. <i>Moon v. Maryland, cert granted</i> (1969), 395 U.S. 975, 89 S.Ct. 2135, 23 L.Ed.2d 764, <i>writ dismissed</i> (1970), 398 U.S. 319, 90 S.Ct. 1730, 26 L.Ed.2d 262; <i>Odom v.

We decline to predict the high Court's answer to the question of <i>Pearce's</i> retroactive or prospective application, but we will apply <i>Pearce</i> in the present case in order to instruct our trial courts as to the Michigan interpretation of an ambiguous portion of <i>Pearce,</i> discussed <i>Infra,</i> pending clarification by the United States Supreme Court.\" <i>People v. Payne,</i> 386 Mich. 84, 90-91, n. 3, 191 N.W.2d 375, 378, n. 2 (1971) (citations omitted). See also Reply Brief for Petitioner in <i>Michigan v.

Payne,</i> 386 Mich. 84, 191 N.W.2d 375 (1971) expressly withheld ruling on the retroactivity of <i>Pearce</i> but applied it to <i>Payne</i> to instruct the lower courts in Michigan\").</p>\n<p>[21]  See <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 210, n. 4, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"<i>Payne</i> does not stand for the expansive proposition that federal law limits the relief a State may provide, but only for the more narrow proposition that a state court's decision that a particular remedy is constitutionally required is itself a federal question\").</p>\n<p>[22]  While the opinions discussed at great length our earlier cases raising retroactivity issues, none of them suggested that federal law would prohibit Arkansas from refunding the taxes at issue if it wanted to do so.</p>\n<p>[23]  The petitioners and the dissenters in <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith</i> relied heavily on separate opinions authored by Justice Harlan, and on the Court's then-recent opinion in <i>Griffith,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649, supporting the proposition that a new constitutional holding should be applied not only in cases that had not yet been tried, but also in all cases still pending on direct review. The plurality, however, declined to follow <i>Griffith</i> because of its view that \"there are important distinctions between the retroactive application of civil and criminal decisions that make the <i>Griffith</i> rationale far less compelling in the civil sphere.\" 496 U.S., at 197, 110 S.Ct. 2323. While Justice Harlan would probably disagree with the suggestion that the distinction between civil and criminal cases provided an acceptable basis for refusing to follow <i>Griffith</i> in the <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith</i> litigation, see <i>Mackey,</i> 401 U.S., at 683, n. 2, 91 S.Ct. 1160 (opinion concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part), if relevant, that same distinction would make it appropriate to disregard the plurality's opinion in <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith</i> in this case.</p>\n<p>[24]  See <i>Boyle v. United Technologies Corp.,</i> 487 U.S. 500, 504, 108 S.Ct. 2510, 101 L.Ed.2d 442 (1988) (\"[W]e have held that a few areas, involving `uniquely federal interests,' are so committed by the Constitution and laws of the United States to federal control that state law is pre-empted and replaced, where necessary, by federal law of a content prescribed ... by the courts\u0097so-called `federal common law'\" (citation omitted)); <i>United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc.,</i> 440 U.S. 715, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979); <i>Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino,</i> 376 U.S. 398, 84 S.Ct. 923, 11 L.Ed.2d 804 (1964).</p>\n<p>[1]  <i>Payne</i> came to us on direct appeal, but as noted, <i>supra,</i> at 1034, we did not at the time distinguish between direct appeal and collateral review for purposes of retroactivity.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Court points out that the defendants in such a case are differently situated because they violated the laws of and were tried in different States. <i>Ante,</i> at 1046-1047. But disparate treatment under substantively different state laws is something we expect in our federal system; disparate treatment under the same Federal Constitution is quite a different matter.\n</p>\n<p>The majority also points out that the rule announced in <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> 479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987)\u0097 that full retroactive application ends with the conclusion of direct appeal\u0097creates its own disuniformity, because finality turns on how quickly a State brings its direct appeals to a close. <i>Ante,</i> at 1047. The same point was raised by the <i>Griffith</i> dissenters, 479 U.S., at 331-332, 107 S.Ct. 708 (opinion of White, J.), and rejected as pertinent by the majority in that case, <i>id.,</i> at 327-328, 107 S.Ct. 708. The disuniformity that the majority emphasizes today and the dissenters emphasized in <i>Griffith</i> is a necessary consequence of our having chosen a relatively clear rule\u0097finality\u0097to delineate the line between full retroactivity and presumptive nonretroactivity. The relevant point is that whatever inequity arises from the <i>Griffith</i> rule, it is based on a balancing of costs and benefits that <i>this</i> Court\u0097not 50 different sovereigns\u0097has performed.</p>\n<p>[3]  A federal court applying state law under <i>Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,</i> 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), follows state choice-of-law rules as well, see <i>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg.

Washing\n  ton, 541 U.

The Min\n  nesota trial and appeals courts concluded that Crawford did not ap\n  ply retroactively under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288. The State\n  Supreme Court agreed, and also concluded that state courts are not\n  free to give a decision of this Court announcing a new constitutional\n  rule of criminal procedure broader retroactive application than that\n  given by this Court.\nHeld: Teague does not constrain the authority of state courts to give\n broader effect to new rules of criminal procedure than is required by\n that opinion. Pp. 4\u201327.\n    (a) Crawford announced a \u201cnew rule\u201d\u2014as defined by Teague\u2014\n because its result \u201cwas not dictated by precedent existing at the time\n the defendant\u2019s conviction became final,\u201d Teague, 489 U.

Under\n Teague, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure may not be\n applied retroactively to cases on federal habeas review unless they\n place certain primary individual conduct beyond the States\u2019 power to\n proscribe or are \u201cwatershed\u201d rules of criminal procedure.

MINNESOTA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (c) Neither Linkletter nor Teague explicitly or implicitly con\n    strained the States\u2019 authority to provide remedies for a broader range\n    of constitutional violations than are redressable on federal habeas.\n    And Teague makes clear that its rule was tailored to the federal ha\n    beas context and thus had no bearing on whether States could pro\n    vide broader relief in their own postconviction proceedings. Nothing\n    in Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s general nonretroactivity rule discussion in\n    Teague asserts or even intimates that her definition of the class eligi\n    ble for relief under a new rule should inhibit the authority of a state\n    agency or state court to extend a new rule\u2019s benefit to a broader class\n    than she defined. Her opinion also clearly indicates that Teague\u2019s\n    general nonretroactivity rule was an exercise of this Court\u2019s power to\n    interpret the federal habeas statute. Since Teague is based on statu\n    tory authority that extends only to federal courts applying a federal\n    statute, it cannot be read as imposing a binding obligation on state\n    courts. The opinion\u2019s text and reasoning also illustrate that the rule\n    was meant to apply only to federal courts considering habeas peti\n    tions challenging state-court criminal convictions. The federal inter\n    est in uniformity in the application of federal law does not outweigh\n    the general principle that States are independent sovereigns with\n    plenary authority to make and enforce their own laws as long as they\n    do not infringe on federal constitutional guarantees. The Teague rule\n    was intended to limit federal courts\u2019 authority to overturn state con\n    victions not to limit a state court\u2019s authority to grant relief for viola\n    tions of new constitutional law rules when reviewing its own State\u2019s\n    convictions. Subsequent cases confirm this view. See, e.g., Beard v.\n    Banks, 542 U. S. 406, 412. Pp. 11\u201318.\n       (d) Neither Michigan v. Payne, 412 U.

S. 167, cast doubt on the state\n    courts\u2019 authority to provide broader remedies for federal constitu\n    tional violations than mandated by Teague. Pp. 18\u201324.\n       (e) No federal rule, either implicitly announced in Teague, or in\n    some other source of federal law, prohibits States from giving broader\n    retroactive effect to new rules of criminal procedure.

MINNESOTA\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      MINNESOTA\n\n                              [February 20, 2008] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   New constitutional rules announced by this Court that\nplace certain kinds of primary individual conduct beyond\nthe power of the States to proscribe, as well as \u201cwater\nshed\u201d rules of criminal procedure, must be applied in all\nfuture trials, all cases pending on direct review, and all\nfederal habeas corpus proceedings. All other new rules of\ncriminal procedure must be applied in future trials and in\ncases pending on direct review, but may not provide the\nbasis for a federal collateral attack on a state-court convic\ntion. This is the substance of the \u201cTeague rule\u201d described\nby Justice O\u2019Connor in her plurality opinion in Teague v.\nLane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989).1 The question in this case is\nwhether Teague constrains the authority of state courts to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although Teague was a plurality opinion that drew support from\n\nonly four Members of the Court, the Teague rule was affirmed and\napplied by a majority of the Court shortly thereafter. See Penry v.\nLynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 313 (1989) (\u201cBecause Penry is before us on\ncollateral review, we must determine, as a threshold matter, whether\ngranting him the relief he seeks would create a new rule. Under\nTeague, new rules will not be applied or announced in cases on collat\neral review unless they fall into one of two exceptions\u201d (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted)).\n2                 DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngive broader effect to new rules of criminal procedure than\nis required by that opinion. We have never suggested that\nit does, and now hold that it does not.\n                               I\n   In 1996 a Minnesota jury found petitioner Stephen\nDanforth guilty of first-degree criminal sexual conduct\nwith a minor. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7609.342, subd. 1(a) (1994).\nThe 6-year-old victim did not testify at trial, but the jury\nsaw and heard a videotaped interview of the child. On\nappeal from his conviction, Danforth argued that the\ntape\u2019s admission violated the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guaran\ntee that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall\nenjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses\nagainst him.\u201d Applying the rule of admissibility set forth\nin Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), the Minnesota\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the tape \u201cwas sufficiently\nreliable to be admitted into evidence,\u201d and affirmed the\nconviction. State v. Danforth, 573 N. W. 2d 369, 375\n(1997). The conviction became final in 1998 when the\nMinnesota Supreme Court denied review and petitioner\u2019s\ntime for filing a writ of certiorari elapsed. See Caspari v.\nBohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 390 (1994).\n   After petitioner\u2019s conviction had become final, we an\nnounced a \u201cnew rule\u201d for evaluating the reliability of\ntestimonial statements in criminal cases. In Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36, 68\u201369 (2004), we held that\nwhere testimonial statements are at issue, \u201cthe only in\ndicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional\ndemands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes:\nconfrontation.\u201d\n   Shortly thereafter, petitioner filed a state postconviction\npetition, in which he argued that he was entitled to a new\ntrial because the admission of the taped interview violated\nthe rule announced in Crawford. Applying the standards\nset forth in Teague, the Minnesota trial court and the\n                      Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                       3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nMinnesota Court of Appeals concluded that Crawford did\nnot apply to petitioner\u2019s case. The State Supreme Court\ngranted review to consider two arguments: (1) that the\nlower courts erred in holding that Crawford did not apply\nretroactively under Teague; and (2) that the state court\nwas \u201cfree to apply a broader retroactivity standard than\nthat of Teague,\u201d and should apply the Crawford rule to\npetitioner\u2019s case even if federal law did not require it to do\nso. 718 N. W. 2d 451, 455 (2006). The court rejected both\narguments. Ibid.\n   With respect to the second, the Minnesota court held\nthat our decisions in Michigan v. Payne, 412 U. S. 47\n(1973), American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S.\n167 (1990), and Teague itself establish that state courts\nare not free to give a Supreme Court decision announcing\na new constitutional rule of criminal procedure broader\nretroactive application than that given by this Court.2 The\nMinnesota Court acknowledged that other state courts\nhad held that Teague does not apply to state postconvic\ntion proceedings,3 but concluded that \u201cwe are not free to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The   relevant passage in the Minnesota Supreme Court opinion\nstates:\n   \u201cDanforth argues that Teague dictates the limits of retroactive\napplication of new rules only in federal habeas corpus proceedings and\ndoes not limit the retroactive application of new rules in state postcon\nviction proceedings. Danforth is incorrect when he asserts that state\ncourts are free to give a Supreme Court decision of federal constitu\ntional criminal procedure broader retroactive application than that\ngiven by the Supreme Court. . . . In light of Payne and American Truck\ning Associations, we cannot apply state retroactivity principles when\ndetermining the retroactivity of a new rule of federal constitutional\ncriminal procedure if the Supreme Court has already provided relevant\nfederal principles.\u201d 718 N. W. 2d 451, 456 (2006).\n   3 See, e.g., Daniels v. State, 561 N. E. 2d 487, 489 (Ind. 1990); State ex\n\nrel. Taylor v. Whitley, 606 So. 2d 1292, 1296\u20131297 (La. 1992); State v.\nWhitfield, 107 S. W. 3d 253, 266\u2013268 (Mo. 2003); Colwell v. State, 118\nNev. 807, 816\u2013819, 59 P. 3d 463, 470\u2013471 (2002) (per curiam); Cowell v.\nLeapley, 458 N. W. 2d 514, 517\u2013518 (S. D. 1990).\n4                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfashion our own standard of retroactivity for Crawford.\u201d\n718 N. W. 2d, at 455\u2013457.\n  Our recent decision in Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U. S.\n___ (2007), makes clear that the Minnesota court correctly\nconcluded that federal law does not require state courts to\napply the holding in Crawford to cases that were final\nwhen that case was decided. Nevertheless, we granted\ncertiorari, 550 U. S. ___ (2007), to consider whether\nTeague or any other federal rule of law prohibits them\nfrom doing so.4\n                               II\n   We begin with a comment on the source of the \u201cnew\nrule\u201d announced in Crawford. For much of our Nation\u2019s\nhistory, federal constitutional rights\u2014such as the Sixth\nAmendment confrontation right at issue in Crawford\u2014\nwere not binding on the States. Federal law, in fact,\nimposed no constraints on the procedures that state courts\ncould or should follow in imposing criminal sanctions on\ntheir citizens. Neither the Federal Constitution as origi\nnally ratified nor any of the Amendments added by the\nBill of Rights in 1791 gave this Court or any other federal-\ncourt power to review the fairness of state criminal proce\ndures. Moreover, before 1867 the statutory authority of\nfederal district courts to issue writs of habeas corpus did\nnot extend to convicted criminals in state custody. See Act\nof Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, \u00a71, 14 Stat. 385.\n   The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment radically\nchanged the federal courts\u2019 relationship with state courts.\nThat Amendment, one of the post-Civil War Reconstruc\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 We note at the outset that this case does not present the questions\n\nwhether States are required to apply \u201cwatershed\u201d rules in state post-\nconviction proceedings, whether the Teague rule applies to cases\nbrought under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72255 (2000 ed., Supp. V), or whether Con\ngress can alter the rules of retroactivity by statute. Accordingly, we\nexpress no opinion on these issues.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion Amendments ratified in 1868, is the source of this\nCourt\u2019s power to decide whether a defendant in a state\nproceeding received a fair trial\u2014i.e., whether his depriva\ntion of liberty was \u201cwithout due process of law.\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 14, \u00a71 (\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any\nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\nlaw\u201d). In construing that Amendment, we have held that\nit imposes minimum standards of fairness on the States,\nand requires state criminal trials to provide defendants\nwith protections \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered lib\nerty.\u201d Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937).\n   Slowly at first, and then at an accelerating pace in the\n1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, the Court held that safeguards afforded\nby the Bill of Rights\u2014including a defendant\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses\nagainst him\u201d\u2014are incorporated in the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment and are therefore binding\nupon the States. See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335\n(1963) (applying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to\nthe States); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965)\n(holding that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of an accused\nto confront the witnesses against him is likewise a funda\nmental right and is made obligatory on the States by the\nFourteenth Amendment\u201d). Our interpretation of that\nbasic Sixth Amendment right of confrontation has evolved\nover the years.\n   In Crawford we accepted the petitioner\u2019s argument that\nthe interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to con\nfrontation that we had previously endorsed in Roberts, 448\nU. S. 56, needed reconsideration because it \u201cstray[ed] from\nthe original meaning of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d 541\nU. S., at 42. We \u201cturn[ed] to the historical background of\nthe Clause to understand its meaning,\u201d id., at 43, and\nrelied primarily on legal developments that had occurred\nprior to the adoption of the Sixth Amendment to derive the\ncorrect interpretation. Id., at 43\u201350. We held that the\n6                     DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cConstitution prescribes a procedure for determining the\nreliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less\nthan the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one\nof our own devising.\u201d Id., at 67.\n   Thus, our opinion in Crawford announced a \u201cnew\nrule\u201d\u2014as that term is defined in Teague\u2014because the\nresult in that case \u201cwas not dictated by precedent existing\nat the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final,\u201d\nTeague, 489 U. S., at 301 (plurality opinion). It was not,\nhowever, a rule \u201cof our own devising\u201d or the product of our\nown views about sound policy.\n                             III\n   Our decision today must also be understood against the\nbackdrop of our somewhat confused and confusing \u201cretro\nactivity\u201d cases decided in the years between 1965 and\n1987. Indeed, we note at the outset that the very word\n\u201cretroactivity\u201d is misleading because it speaks in temporal\nterms. \u201cRetroactivity\u201d suggests that when we declare that\na new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is \u201cnonret\nroactive,\u201d we are implying that the right at issue was not\nin existence prior to the date the \u201cnew rule\u201d was an\nnounced. But this is incorrect. As we have already ex\nplained, the source of a \u201cnew rule\u201d is the Constitution\nitself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law.\nAccordingly, the underlying right necessarily pre-exists\nour articulation of the new rule. What we are actually\ndetermining when we assess the \u201cretroactivity\u201d of a new\nrule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right,\nbut whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to\nthe announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal\ndefendant to the relief sought.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 It\n      may, therefore, make more sense to speak in terms of the \u201cre\ndressability\u201d of violations of new rules, rather than the \u201cretroactivity\u201d of\nsuch rules. Cf. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167,\n201 (1990) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cThe very framing of\n                      Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Originally, criminal defendants whose convictions were\nfinal were entitled to federal habeas relief only if the court\nthat rendered the judgment under which they were in\ncustody lacked jurisdiction to do so. Ex parte Watkins, 3\nPet. 193 (1830); Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 176 (1874);\nEx parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 376\u2013377 (1880).6 In 1915,\nthe realm of violations for which federal habeas relief\nwould be available to state prisoners was expanded to\ninclude state proceedings that \u201cdeprive[d] the accused of\nhis life or liberty without due process of law.\u201d Frank v.\nMangum, 237 U. S. 309, 335 (1915). In the early 1900\u2019s,\nhowever, such relief was only granted when the constitu\ntional violation was so serious that it effectively rendered\nthe conviction void for lack of jurisdiction. See, e.g., Moore\nv. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923) (mob domination of a\ntrial); Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935) (per cu\nriam) (knowing use of perjured testimony by the prosecu\ntion); Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942) (per curiam)\n(coerced guilty plea).7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe issue that we purport to decide today\u2014whether our decision in\n[American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987),] shall\n\u2018apply\u2019 retroactively\u2014presupposes [an incorrect] view of our decisions\nas creating the law, as opposed to declaring what the law already is\u201d).\nUnfortunately, it would likely create, rather than alleviate, confusion to\nchange our terminology at this point. Accordingly, we will continue to\nutilize the existing vocabulary, despite its shortcomings.\n   6 Although our post-1867 cases reflected a \u201csoftening\u201d of the concept of\n\njurisdiction to embrace claims that the statute under which the peti\ntioner had been convicted was unconstitutional or that the detention\nwas based on an illegally imposed sentence, the Court adhered to the\nbasic rule that habeas was unavailable to review claims of constitu\ntional error that did not go to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. See Bator,\nFinality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prison\ners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 471, 483\u2013484 (1963); Hart, The Supreme\nCourt 1958 Term, Foreword: The Time Chart of the Justices, 73 Harv.\nL. Rev. 84, 103\u2013104 (1959).\n   7 \u201c[I]n Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942), the Court openly dis\n\ncarded the concept of jurisdiction\u2014by then more [of] a fiction than\n8                     DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   The serial incorporation of the Amendments in the Bill\nof Rights during the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s imposed more\nconstitutional obligations on the States and created more\nopportunity for claims that individuals were being con\nvicted without due process and held in violation of the\nConstitution. Nevertheless, until 1965 the Court contin\nued to construe every constitutional error, including newly\nannounced ones, as entitling state prisoners to relief on\nfederal habeas. \u201cNew\u201d constitutional rules of criminal\nprocedure were, without discussion or analysis, routinely\napplied to cases on habeas review. See, e.g., Jackson v.\nDenno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); Gideon, 372 U. S. 335;\nEskridge v. Washington Bd. of Prison Terms and Paroles,\n357 U. S. 214 (1958) (per curiam).\n   In Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965), the Court\nexpressly considered the issue of \u201cretroactivity\u201d for the\nfirst time. Adopting a practical approach, we held that the\nretroactive effect of each new rule should be determined\non a case-by-case basis by examining the purpose of the\nrule, the reliance of the States on the prior law, and the\neffect on the administration of justice of retroactive appli\ncation of the rule. Id., at 629. Applying those considera\ntions to the exclusionary rule announced in Mapp v. Ohio,\n367 U. S. 643 (1961), we held that the Mapp rule would\nnot be given retroactive effect; it would not, in other\nwords, be applied to convictions that were final before the\ndate of the Mapp decision.8 Linkletter, 381 U. S., at 636\u2013\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nanything else\u2014as a touchstone of the availability of federal habeas\nreview, and acknowledged that such review is available for claims of\ndisregard of the constitutional rights of the accused . . . .\u201d Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 79 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   8 Linkletter arose in the context of a denial of federal habeas relief, so\n\nits holding was \u201cnecessarily limited to convictions which had become\nfinal by the time Mapp . . . [was] rendered.\u201d Johnson v. New Jersey,\n384 U. S. 719, 732 (1966). We noted in Linkletter that Mapp was being\napplied to cases that were still pending on direct review at the time it\nwas decided, so the issue before us was expressly limited to \u201cwhether\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n640.\n  During the next four years, application of the Linkletter\nstandard produced strikingly divergent results. As Justice\nHarlan pointed out in his classic dissent in Desist v.\nUnited States, 394 U. S. 244, 257 (1969), one new rule was\napplied to all cases subject to direct review, Tehan v.\nUnited States ex rel. Shott, 382 U. S. 406 (1966); another\nto all cases in which trials had not yet commenced, John\nson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S. 719 (1966); another to all\ncases in which tainted evidence had not yet been intro\nduced at trial, Fuller v. Alaska, 393 U. S. 80 (1968) (per\ncuriam); and still others only to the party involved in the\ncase in which the new rule was announced and to all\nfuture cases in which the proscribed official conduct had\nnot yet occurred, Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293 (1967);\nDeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968) (per curiam). He\nreasonably questioned whether such decisions \u201cmay prop\nerly be considered the legitimate products of a court of\nlaw, rather than the commands of a super-legislature.\u201d\n394 U. S., at 259.\n  Justice Harlan\u2019s dissent in Desist, buttressed by his\neven more searching separate opinion in Mackey v. United\nStates, 401 U. S. 667, 675 (1971) (opinion concurring in\njudgments in part and dissenting in part), and scholarly\ncriticism,9 laid the groundwork for the eventual demise of\nthe Linkletter standard. In Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S.\n314 (1987), the Court rejected as \u201cunprincipled and inequi\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe exclusionary principle enunciated in Mapp applies to state court\nconvictions which had become final before rendition of our opinion.\u201d\n381 U. S., at 622 (footnote omitted). Shortly thereafter, however, we\nheld that the three-pronged Linkletter analysis should be applied both\nto convictions that were final before rendition of our opinions and to\ncases that were still pending on direct review. See Johnson, 384 U. S.,\nat 732; Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293 (1967).\n  9 See, e.g., Haddad, \u201cRetroactivity Should be Rethought\u201d: A Call for\n\nthe End of the Linkletter Doctrine, 60 J. Crim. L., C. & P. S. 417 (1969).\n10                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntable,\u201d the application of the Linkletter standard to cases\npending on direct review. In Teague, Justice O\u2019Connor\nreaffirmed Griffith\u2019s rejection of the Linkletter standard\nfor determining the \u201cretroactive\u201d applicability of new rules\nto state convictions that were not yet final and rejected the\nLinkletter standard for cases pending on federal habeas\nreview. She adopted (with a significant modification) the\napproach advocated by Justice Harlan for federal collat\neral review of final state judgments.\n   Justice O\u2019Connor endorsed a general rule of nonretroac\ntivity for cases on collateral review, stating that \u201c[u]nless\nthey fall within an exception to the general rule, new\nconstitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be\napplicable to those cases which have become final before\nthe new rules are announced.\u201d 489 U. S., at 310 (plurality\nopinion). The opinion defined two exceptions: rules that\nrender types of primary conduct \u201c \u2018beyond the power of the\ncriminal law-making authority to proscribe,\u2019 \u201d id., at 311,\nand \u201cwatershed\u201d rules that \u201cimplicate the fundamental\nfairness of the trial,\u201d id., at 311, 312, 313.10\n   It is clear that Linkletter and then Teague considered\nwhat constitutional violations may be remedied on federal\nhabeas.11 They did not define the scope of the \u201cnew\u201d con\nstitutional rights themselves. Nor, as we shall explain,\ndid Linkletter or Teague (or any of the other cases relied\nupon by respondent and the Minnesota Supreme Court)\nspeak to the entirely separate question whether States can\nprovide remedies for violations of these rights in their own\npostconviction proceedings.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Rules of the former type \u201care more accurately characterized as\n\nsubstantive rules not subject to [Teague\u2019s] bar.\u201d Schriro v. Summerlin,\n542 U. S. 348, 352, n. 4 (2004).\n  11 Similarly, Johnson, and Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987),\n\ndefined the scope of constitutional violations that would be remedied on\ndirect appeal.\n                       Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008) \n                       11\n\n                            Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             IV\n\n  Neither Linkletter nor Teague explicitly or implicitly\nconstrained the authority of the States to provide reme\ndies for a broader range of constitutional violations than\nare redressable on federal habeas. Linkletter spoke in\nbroad terms about the retroactive applicability of new\nrules to state convictions that had become final prior to\nour announcement of the rules. Although Linkletter arose\non federal habeas, the opinion did not rely on that proce\ndural posture as a factor in its holding or analysis. Ar\nguably, therefore, the approach it established might have\nbeen applied with equal force to both federal and state\ncourts reviewing final state convictions. But we did not\nstate\u2014and the state courts did not conclude\u2014that Linklet\nter imposed such a limitation on the States.12\n  A year after deciding Linkletter, we granted certiorari in\nJohnson to address the retroactivity of the rules an\nnounced in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964), and\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Applying the\nstandard announced in Linkletter, we held that those rules\nshould be applied only to trials that began after the re\nspective dates of those decisions; they were given no retro\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The dissent is correct that at least one \u201cthoughtful legal scholar\u201d\n\nbelieved that Linkletter did preclude States from applying new consti\ntutional rules more broadly than our cases required. Post, at 4 (citing\nMishkin, Foreword: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due\nProcess of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 56, 91, n. 132 (1965)).\nNotably, this comment was made in the context of an attack on Linklet\nter\u2019s prospective approach as inconsistent with the idea that judges are\n\u201cbound by a body of fixed, overriding law.\u201d Mishkin, 79 Harv. L. Rev.,\nat 62. Moreover, the footnote cited by the dissent concludes with a\nstatement that \u201cthe reservation to the states of the power to apply [new\nrules] to all convictions, . . . is . . . the preferable pattern.\u201d Id., at 91, n.\n132. In all events, even if Linkletter and its progeny rested on the\nassumption that \u201cnew rules\u201d of constitutional law did not exist until\nannounced by this Court, that view of the law was rejected when we\nendorsed Justice Harlan\u2019s analysis of retroactivity.\n12                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nactive effect beyond the parties in Miranda and Escobedo\nthemselves.13\n  Notably, the Oregon Supreme Court decided to give\nretroactive effect to Escobedo despite our holding in John\nson. In State v. Fair, 263 Ore. 383, 502 P. 2d 1150 (1972),\nthe Oregon court noted that it was continuing to apply\nEscobedo retroactively and correctly stated that \u201cwe are\nfree to choose the degree of retroactivity or prospectivity\nwhich we believe appropriate to the particular rule under\nconsideration, so long as we give federal constitutional\nrights at least as broad a scope as the United States Su\npreme Court requires.\u201d 263 Ore., at 387\u2013388, 502 P. 2d, at\n1152. In so holding, the Oregon court cited our language\nin Johnson that \u201c \u2018States are still entirely free to effectuate\nunder their own law stricter standards than those we have\nlaid down and to apply those standards in a broader range\nof cases than is required by this decision.\u2019 \u201d 263 Ore., at\n386, 502 P. 2d, at 1151 (quoting Johnson, 384 U. S., at\n733).14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 That same year, we similarly denied retroactive effect to the rule\n\nannounced in Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), prohibiting\nprosecutorial comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. See Tehan\nv. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U. S. 406 (1966). Shortly thereafter,\nin a case involving a Griffin error, we held for the first time that there\nare some constitutional errors that do not require the automatic rever\nsal of a conviction. Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 22 (1967).\nBoth Shott and Chapman protected the State of California from a\npotentially massive exodus of state prisoners because their prosecutors\nand judges had routinely commented on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\n   14 Although the plain meaning of this language in Johnson is that a\n\nstate creating its own substantive standards can be as generous with\ntheir retroactive effect as it wishes, courts and commentators both\nbefore and after Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), cited this lan\nguage in support of the proposition that state courts \u201cmay apply new\nconstitutional standards \u2018in a broader range of cases than is required\u2019\nby th[is] Court\u2019s decision not to apply the standards retroactively.\u201d\nColwell v. State, 118 Nev. 807, 818, 59 P. 3d 463, 470\u2013471 (2002) (per\ncuriam); see also Stith, A Contrast of State and Federal Court Author\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Like Linkletter, Teague arose on federal habeas. Unlike\nin Linkletter, however, this procedural posture was not\nmerely a background fact in Teague. A close reading of\nthe Teague opinion makes clear that the rule it estab\nlished was tailored to the unique context of federal habeas\nand therefore had no bearing on whether States could\nprovide broader relief in their own postconviction proceed\nings than required by that opinion. Because the case\nbefore us now does not involve either of the \u201cTeague excep\ntions,\u201d it is Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s discussion of the general\nrule of nonretroactivity that merits the following three\ncomments.\n   First, not a word in Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s discussion\u2014or in\neither of the opinions of Justice Harlan that provided the\nblueprint for her entire analysis\u2014asserts or even inti\nmates that her definition of the class eligible for relief\nunder a new rule should inhibit the authority of any state\nagency or state court to extend the benefit of a new rule to\na broader class than she defined.\n   Second, Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion clearly indicates that\nTeague\u2019s general rule of nonretroactivity was an exercise\nof this Court\u2019s power to interpret the federal habeas stat\nute. Chapter 153 of Title 28 of the U. S. Code gives federal\ncourts the authority to grant \u201cwrits of habeas corpus,\u201d but\nleaves unresolved many important questions about the\nscope of available relief. This Court has interpreted that\ncongressional silence\u2014along with the statute\u2019s command\nto dispose of habeas petitions \u201cas law and justice require,\u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72243\u2014as an authorization to adjust the scope\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nity to Grant Habeas Relief, 38 Val. U. L. Rev. 421, 443 (2004). Thirty\nyears after deciding State v. Fair, the Oregon Supreme Court \u201cdis\navowed\u201d this analysis based on our decisions in Oregon v. Hass, 420\nU. S. 714 (1975), and American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496\nU. S. 167. Page v. Palmateer, 336 Ore. 379, 84 P. 3d 133 (2004). As we\nexplain infra, at 19, 20, its reliance on those cases was misplaced, and\nits decision to change course was therefore misguided.\n14                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nof the writ in accordance with equitable and prudential\nconsiderations. See, e.g., Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S.\n619 (1993) (harmless-error standard); McCleskey v. Zant,\n499 U. S. 467 (1991) (abuse-of-the-writ bar to relief);\nWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977) (procedural\ndefault); Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976) (cognizabil\nity of Fourth Amendment claims). Teague is plainly\ngrounded in this authority, as the opinion expressly situ\nated the rule it announced in this line of cases adjusting\nthe scope of federal habeas relief in accordance with equi\ntable and prudential considerations. 489 U. S., at 308\n(plurality opinion) (citing, inter alia, Wainwright and\nStone).15 Since Teague is based on statutory authority\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Subsequent decisions have characterized Teague in a similar fash\n\nion. See, e.g., Brecht, 507 U. S., at 633, 634 (stating that \u201cin defining\nthe scope of the writ, we look first to the considerations underlying our\nhabeas jurisprudence,\u201d and identifying Teague as an example). And\nindividual Justices have been even more explicit.            See Day v.\nMcDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 214 (2006) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (describ\ning, inter alia, the Teague rule as having been \u201ccreated by the habeas\ncourts themselves, in the exercise of their traditional equitable discre\ntion . . . because [it was] seen as necessary to protect the interests of\ncomity and finality that federal collateral review of state criminal\nproceedings necessarily implicates\u201d); Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S.\n680, 699 (1993) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(listing Teague as one illustration of the principle that \u201cfederal courts\nexercising their habeas powers may refuse to grant relief on certain\nclaims because of \u2018prudential concerns\u2019 such as equity and federalism\u201d);\n507 U. S., at 718 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(stating that Teague and other \u201cgateways through which a habeas\npetitioner must pass before proceeding to the merits of a constitutional\nclaim\u201d are \u201cgrounded in the equitable discretion of habeas courts\u201d\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); Teague, 489 U. S., at\n317 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (charac\nterizing Teague as a decision \u201cconstruing the reach of the habeas corpus\nstatutes\u201d and contrasting it with Griffith, which \u201cappear[s] to have\nconstitutional underpinnings\u201d); 489 U. S., at 332\u2013333 (Brennan, J.,\ndissenting) (characterizing Teague as an unwarranted change in \u201c[this\nCourt\u2019s] interpretation of the federal habeas statute\u201d); see also Mackey\nv. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 684 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthat extends only to federal courts applying a federal\nstatute, it cannot be read as imposing a binding obligation\non state courts.\n   Third, the text and reasoning of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s\nopinion also illustrate that the rule was meant to apply\nonly to federal courts considering habeas corpus petitions\nchallenging state-court criminal convictions.          Justice\nO\u2019Connor made numerous references to the \u201cGreat writ\u201d\nand the \u201cwrit,\u201d and expressly stated that \u201c[t]he relevant\nframe of reference\u201d for determining the appropriate retro\nactivity rule is defined by \u201cthe purposes for which the writ\nof habeas corpus is made available.\u201d 489 U. S., at 306\n(plurality opinion). Moreover, she justified the general\nrule of nonretroactivity in part by reference to comity and\nrespect for the finality of state convictions. Federalism\nand comity considerations are unique to federal habeas\nreview of state convictions. See, e.g., State v. Preciose, 129\nN. J. 451, 475, 609 A. 2d 1280, 1292 (1992) (explaining\nthat comity and federalism concerns \u201csimply do not apply\nwhen this Court reviews procedural rulings by our lower\ncourts\u201d). If anything, considerations of comity militate in\nfavor of allowing state courts to grant habeas relief to a\nbroader class of individuals than is required by Teague.\nAnd while finality is, of course, implicated in the context of\nstate as well as federal habeas, finality of state convictions\nis a state interest, not a federal one. It is a matter that\nStates should be free to evaluate, and weigh the impor\ntance of, when prisoners held in state custody are seeking\na remedy for a violation of federal rights by their lower\ncourts.\n   The dissent correctly points out that Teague was also\ngrounded in concerns over uniformity and the inequity\ninherent in the Linkletter approach. There is, of course, a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\njudgments in part and dissenting in part) (describing the problem of \n\nretroactivity as \u201ca problem as to the scope of the habeas writ\u201d). \n\n16                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal interest in \u201creducing the inequity of haphazard\nretroactivity standards and disuniformity in the applica\ntion of federal law.\u201d Post, at 12. This interest in uniform\nity, however, does not outweigh the general principle that\nStates are independent sovereigns with plenary authority\nto make and enforce their own laws as long as they do not\ninfringe on federal constitutional guarantees. The funda\nmental interest in federalism that allows individual States\nto define crimes, punishments, rules of evidence, and rules\nof criminal and civil procedure in a variety of different\nways\u2014so long as they do not violate the Federal Constitu\ntion\u2014is not otherwise limited by any general, undefined\nfederal interest in uniformity. Nonuniformity is, in fact,\nan unavoidable reality in a federalist system of govern\nment. Any State could surely have adopted the rule of\nevidence defined in Crawford under state law even if that\ncase had never been decided. It should be equally free to\ngive its citizens the benefit of our rule in any fashion that\ndoes not offend federal law.\n   It is thus abundantly clear that the Teague rule of non-\nretroactivity was fashioned to achieve the goals of federal\nhabeas while minimizing federal intrusion into state\ncriminal proceedings. It was intended to limit the author\nity of federal courts to overturn state convictions\u2014not to\nlimit a state court\u2019s authority to grant relief for violations\nof new rules of constitutional law when reviewing its own\nState\u2019s convictions.16\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 The lower federal courts have also applied the Teague rule to mo\n\ntions to vacate, set aside, or correct a federal sentence pursuant to 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72255 (2000 ed., Supp. V). Much of the reasoning applicable to\napplications for writs of habeas corpus filed pursuant to \u00a72254 seems\nequally applicable in the context of \u00a72255 motions. See United States v.\nHayman, 342 U. S. 205 (1952) (explaining that \u00a72255 was enacted as a\nfunctional equivalent for habeas corpus to allow federal prisoners to\nbring a collateral attack in the court that imposed the sentence rather\nthan a court that happened to be near the prison).\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our subsequent cases, which characterize the Teague\nrule as a standard limiting only the scope of federal ha\nbeas relief, confirm that Teague speaks only to the context\nof federal habeas. See, e.g., Beard v. Banks, 542 U. S. 406,\n412 (2004) (\u201cTeague\u2019s nonretroactivity principle acts as a\nlimitation on the power of federal courts to grant habeas\ncorpus relief to state prisoners\u201d (internal quotation marks,\nellipsis, and brackets omitted)); Caspari, 510 U.

See, e.g., Cowell v. Leapley, 458 N. W. 2d 514\n(S. D. 1990); Preciose, 129 N. J. 451, 609 A. 2d 1280; State\nex rel. Schmelzer v. Murphy, 201 Wis. 2d 246, 256\u2013257,\n548 N.

As\nfar as we can tell, only three States\u2014Minnesota, Oregon, and Mon\ntana\u2014have adopted a contrary view. See Page, 336 Ore. 379, 84 P. 3d\n133; Egelhoff, 272 Mont. 114, 900 P. 2d 260.\n18                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal habeas, but does not in any way limit the authority\nof a state court, when reviewing its own state criminal\nconvictions, to provide a remedy for a violation that is\ndeemed \u201cnonretroactive\u201d under Teague.\n                            V\n  The State contends that two of our prior decisions\u2014\nMichigan v. Payne and American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.\nSmith\u2014cast doubt on state courts\u2019 authority to provide\nbroader remedies for federal constitutional violations than\nmandated by Teague. We disagree.\n                              A\n  In Michigan v. Payne, 412 U. S. 47, we considered the\nretroactivity of the rule prohibiting \u201cvindictive\u201d resentenc\ning that had been announced in our opinion in North\nCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 723\u2013726 (1969).18 Rely\ning on the approach set forth in Linkletter and Stovall, we\nheld that the Pearce rule did not apply because Payne\u2019s\nresentencing had occurred prior to Pearce\u2019s date of deci\nsion.19 We therefore reversed the judgment of the Michi\ngan Supreme Court, which had applied Pearce retroac\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 In Pearce, we held:\n\u201c[W]henever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant\nafter a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively ap\npear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concern\ning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the\ntime of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual data upon\nwhich the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record,\nso that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be\nfully reviewed on appeal.\u201d 395 U. S., at 726.\n  As the concurrence pointed out, some States already provided equiva\nlent or broader protection against vindictive sentencing. See id., at\n733\u2013734, n. 4 (opinion of Douglas, J.).\n  19 Given the fact that Payne\u2019s appeal was still pending on that date,\n\nhowever, the result would have been different and the views of the\ndissenting Justices would have prevailed if the case had been decided\nafter our decision in Teague.\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntively, and remanded for further proceedings.\n   At first blush the fact that we reversed the judgment of\nthe Michigan court appears to lend support to the view\nthat state courts may not give greater retroactive effect to\nnew rules announced by this Court than we expressly\nauthorize. But, as our opinion in Payne noted, the Michi\ngan Supreme Court had applied the Pearce rule retroac\ntively \u201c \u2018pending clarification\u2019 \u201d by this Court. 412 U. S., at\n49. As the Michigan Court explained, it had applied the\nnew rule in the case before it in order to give guidance to\nMichigan trial courts concerning what it regarded as an\nambiguity in Pearce\u2019s new rule.20 The Michigan Court did\nnot purport to make a definitive ruling on the retroactivity\nof Pearce; nor did it purport to apply a broader state rule\nof retroactivity than required by federal law. Our opinion\nin Payne did not require the Michigan Supreme Court to\nmodify its disposition of the case; it simply remanded for\nfurther proceedings after providing the clarification that\nthe Michigan Court sought. Most significantly, other than\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 The relevant footnote in the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\n\nexplained:\n\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has not yet decided whether Pearce\nis to be applied retroactively. Although the Court twice granted certio\nrari to consider the question, in each case the writ was subsequently\ndismissed as improvidently granted. Moon v. Maryland, cert granted\n(1969), 395 US 975, writ dismissed (1970), 398 US 319; Odom v. United\nStates, cert granted (1970), 399 US 904, writ dismissed (1970), 400 US\n23. We decline to predict the high Court\u2019s answer to the question of\nPearce\u2019s retroactive or prospective application, but we will apply Pearce\nin the present case in order to instruct our trial courts as to the Michi\ngan interpretation of an ambiguous portion of Pearce, discussed Infra,\npending clarification by the United States Supreme Court.\u201d People v.\nPayne, 386 Mich. 84, 90\u201391, n. 3, 191 N.

MINNESOTA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe fact that the case was remanded for further proceed\nings, not a word in our Payne opinion suggests that the\nCourt intended to prohibit state courts from applying new\nconstitutional standards in a broader range of cases than\nwe require.21\n   Notably, at least some state courts continued, after\nPayne, to adopt and apply broader standards of retroactiv\nity than required by our decisions. In Pennsylvania v.\nMcCormick, 359 Pa. Super. 461, 470, 519 A. 2d 442, 447\n(1986), for example, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania\nchose not to follow this Court\u2019s nonretroactivity holding in\nAllen v. Hardy, 478 U. S. 255 (1986) (per curiam). The\nPennsylvania court correctly explained that our decision\nwas \u201cnot binding authority [in part] because neither the\nfederal nor the state constitution dictate which decisions\nmust be given retroactive effect.\u201d 359 Pa.

S.\n167, petitioners challenged the constitutionality of an\nArkansas statute enacted in 1983 that imposed a dis\ncriminatory burden on interstate truckers. While their\nsuit was pending, this Court declared a virtually identical\nPennsylvania tax unconstitutional. See American Truck\ning Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266 (1987). Shortly\nthereafter, the Arkansas Supreme Court struck down the\nArkansas tax at issue. The primary issue in Smith was\nwhether petitioners were entitled to a refund of taxes that\nwere assessed before the date of our decision in Scheiner.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  21 See American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at 210, n. 4\n\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\u201cPayne does not stand for the expansive\nproposition that federal law limits the relief a State may provide, but\nonly for the more narrow proposition that a state court\u2019s decision that\na particular remedy is constitutionally required is itself a federal\nquestion\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Arkansas Court held that petitioners were not\nentitled to a refund because our decision in Scheiner did\nnot apply retroactively. Four Members of this Court\nagreed. The plurality opinion concluded that federal law\ndid not provide petitioners with a right to a refund of pre-\nScheiner tax payments because Scheiner did not apply\nretroactively to invalidate the Arkansas tax prior to its\ndate of decision. Four Members of this Court dissented.\nThe dissenting opinion argued that the case actually\nraised both the substantive question whether the tax\nviolated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution\nand the remedial question whether, if so, the petitioners\nwere entitled to a refund. The dissent concluded as a\nmatter of federal law that the tax was invalid during the\nyears before Scheiner, and that petitioners were entitled to\na decision to that effect. Whether petitioners should get a\nrefund, however, the dissent deemed a mixed question of\nstate and federal law that should be decided by the state\ncourt in the first instance.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA concurred with the plurality\u2019s judgment\nbecause he disagreed with the substantive rule announced\nin Scheiner, but he did not agree with the plurality\u2019s rea\nsoning. After stating that his views on retroactivity di\nverged from the plurality\u2019s \u201cin a fundamental way,\u201d\nJUSTICE SCALIA explained:\n    \u201cI share [the dissent\u2019s] perception that prospective de\n    cisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role,\n    which is to say what the law is, not to prescribe what\n    [the law] shall be. The very framing of the issue that\n    we purport to decide today\u2014whether our decision in\n    Scheiner shall \u2018apply\u2019 retroactively\u2014presupposes a\n    view of our decisions as creating the law, as opposed\n    to declaring what the law already is. Such a view is\n    contrary to that understanding of \u2018the judicial Power,\u2019\n    U. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 1, which is not only the com\n22                DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     mon and traditional one, but which is the only one\n     that can justify courts in denying force and effect to\n     the unconstitutional enactments of duly elected legis\n     latures, see Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137\n     (1803)\u2014the very exercise of judicial power asserted in\n     Scheiner. To hold a governmental Act to be unconsti\n     tutional is not to announce that we forbid it, but that\n     the Constitution forbids it; and when, as in this case,\n     the constitutionality of a state statute is placed in is\n     sue, the question is not whether some decision of ours\n     \u2018applies\u2019 in the way that a law applies; the question is\n     whether the Constitution, as interpreted in that deci\n     sion, invalidates the statute. Since the Constitution\n     does not change from year to year; since it does not\n     conform to our decisions, but our decisions are sup\n     posed to conform to it; the notion that our interpreta\n     tion of the Constitution in a particular decision could\n     take prospective form does not make sense. Either\n     enforcement of the statute at issue in Scheiner (which\n     occurred before our decision there) was unconstitu\n     tional, or it was not; if it was, then so is enforcement\n     of all identical statutes in other States, whether oc\n     curring before or after our decision; and if it was not,\n     then Scheiner was wrong, and the issue of whether to\n     \u2018apply\u2019 that decision needs no further attention.\u201d\n     American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at\n     201.\nBecause JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s vote rested on his disagreement\nwith the substantive rule announced in Scheiner\u2014rather\nthan with the retroactivity analysis in the dissenting\nopinion\u2014there were actually five votes supporting the\ndissent\u2019s views on the retroactivity issue. Accordingly, it\nis the dissent rather than the plurality that should inform\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86 (1993). Harper,\nlike Smith, involved a request for a refund of taxes paid\nbefore we declared a similar Michigan tax unconstitu\ntional. We held that the Virginia tax at issue in Harper\nwas in fact invalid\u2014even before we declared the similar\ntax unconstitutional\u2014but that this did not necessarily\nentitle the petitioners to a full refund. We explained that\nthe Constitution required Virginia to \u201c \u2018provide relief con\nsistent with federal due process principles,\u2019 \u201d 509 U. S., at\n100 (citing American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496\nU. S., at 181), but that \u201c \u2018a State found to have imposed an\nimpermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in\nresponding to this determination\u2019 \u201d under the due process\nclause, 509 U. S., at 100 (citing McKesson Corp. v. Division\nof Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business\nRegulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39\u201340 (1990)). We left to the\n\u201cVirginia courts this question of state law and the per\nformance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any\nappropriate remedy.\u201d 509 U. S., at 102. And we specifi\ncally noted that Virginia \u201c \u2018is free to choose which form of\nrelief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the\nminimum federal requirements we have outlined.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(citing McKesson, 496 U.

MINNESOTA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsupport our conclusion that the remedy a state court\nchooses to provide its citizens for violations of the Federal\nConstitution is primarily a question of state law. Federal\nlaw simply \u201csets certain minimum requirements that\nStates must meet but may exceed in providing appropriate\nrelief.\u201d American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496\nU. S., at 178\u2013179 (plurality opinion). They provide no\nsupport for the proposition that federal law places a limit\non state authority to provide remedies for federal constitu\ntional violations.\n                             VI\n   Finally, while the State acknowledges that it may grant\nits citizens broader protection than the Federal Constitu\ntion requires by enacting appropriate legislation or by\njudicial interpretation of its own Constitution, it argues\nthat it may not do so by judicial misconstruction of federal\nlaw. Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714 (1975)\u2014like our early\ndecisions in Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. 506 (1859), and\nTarble\u2019s Case, 13 Wall. 397 (1872)\u2014provides solid support\nfor that proposition. But the States that give broader\nretroactive effect to this Court\u2019s new rules of criminal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nInc. v. Smith relied heavily on separate opinions authored by Justice\nHarlan, and on the Court\u2019s then-recent opinion in Griffith, 479 U. S.\n314, supporting the proposition that a new constitutional holding\nshould be applied not only in cases that had not yet been tried, but also\nin all cases still pending on direct review. The plurality, however,\ndeclined to follow Griffith because of its view that \u201cthere are important\ndistinctions between the retroactive application of civil and criminal\ndecisions that make the Griffith rationale far less compelling in the\ncivil sphere.\u201d 496 U. S., at 197. While Justice Harlan would probably\ndisagree with the suggestion that the distinction between civil and\ncriminal cases provided an acceptable basis for refusing to follow\nGriffith in the American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith litigation, see\nMackey, 401 U. S., at 683, n. 2 (opinion concurring in judgments in part\nand dissenting in part), if relevant, that same distinction would make it\nappropriate to disregard the plurality\u2019s opinion in American Trucking\nAssns., Inc. v. Smith in this case.\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprocedure do not do so by misconstruing the federal\nTeague standard. Rather, they have developed state law\nto govern retroactivity in state postconviction proceedings.\nSee, e.g., State v. Whitfield, 107 S. W. 3d 253, 268 (Mo.\n2003) (\u201c[A]s a matter of state law, this Court chooses not\nto adopt the Teague analysis . . .\u201d). The issue in this case\nis whether there is a federal rule, either implicitly an\nnounced in Teague, or in some other source of federal law,\nthat prohibits them from doing so.\n   The absence of any precedent for the claim that Teague\nlimits state collateral review courts\u2019 authority to provide\nremedies for federal constitutional violations is a sufficient\nreason for concluding that there is no such rule of federal\nlaw. That conclusion is confirmed by several additional\nconsiderations. First, if there is such a federal rule of law,\npresumably the Supremacy Clause in Article V of the\nFederal Constitution would require all state entities\u2014not\njust state judges\u2014to comply with it. We have held that\nStates can waive a Teague defense, during the course of\nlitigation, by expressly choosing not to rely on it, see\nCollins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41 (1990), or by fail\ning to raise it in a timely manner, see Schiro v. Farley, 510\nU. S. 222, 228\u2013229 (1994). It would indeed be anomalous\nto hold that state legislatures and executives are not\nbound by Teague, but that state courts are.\n   Second, the State has not identified, and we cannot\ndiscern, the source of our authority to promulgate such a\nnovel rule of federal law. While we have ample authority\nto control the administration of justice in the federal\ncourts\u2014particularly in their enforcement of federal legis\nlation\u2014we have no comparable supervisory authority over\nthe work of state judges. Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U. S.\n911 (1997). And while there are federal interests that\noccasionally justify this Court\u2019s development of common\n26                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw rules of federal law,24 our normal role is to interpret\nlaw created by others and \u201cnot to prescribe what it shall\nbe.\u201d American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S., at\n201 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Just as constitu\ntional doubt may tip the scales in favor of one construction\nof a statute rather than another, so does uncertainty about\nthe source of authority to impose a federal limit on the\npower of state judges to remedy wrongful state convictions\noutweigh any possible policy arguments favoring the rule\nthat respondent espouses.\n   Finally, the dissent contends that the \u201cend result [of this\nopinion] is startling\u201d because \u201ctwo criminal defendants,\neach of whom committed the same crime, at the same\ntime, whose convictions became final on the same day, and\neach of whom raised an identical claim at the same time\nunder the Federal Constitution\u201d could obtain different\nresults. Post, at 1. This assertion ignores the fact that the\ntwo hypothetical criminal defendants did not actually\ncommit the \u201csame crime.\u201d They violated different state\nlaws, were tried in and by different state sovereigns, and\nmay\u2014for many reasons\u2014be subject to different penalties.\nAs previously noted, such nonuniformity is a necessary\nconsequence of a federalist system of government.\n                            VII\n   It is important to keep in mind that our jurisprudence\nconcerning the \u201cretroactivity\u201d of \u201cnew rules\u201d of constitu\ntional law is primarily concerned, not with the question\nwhether a constitutional violation occurred, but with the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 See Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S. 500, 504 (1988)\n(\u201c[W]e have held that a few areas, involving \u2018uniquely federal interests,\u2019\nare so committed by the Constitution and laws of the United States to\nfederal control that state law is pre-empted and replaced, where neces\nsary, by federal law of a content prescribed . . . by the courts\u2014so-called\n\u2018federal common law\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); United States v.

Smith, 496 U. S., at 205\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n   A decision by this Court that a new rule does not apply\nretroactively under Teague does not imply that there was\nno right and thus no violation of that right at the time of\ntrial\u2014only that no remedy will be provided in federal\nhabeas courts. It is fully consistent with a government of\nlaws to recognize that the finality of a judgment may bar\nrelief. It would be quite wrong to assume, however, that\nthe question whether constitutional violations occurred in\ntrials conducted before a certain date depends on how\nmuch time was required to complete the appellate process.\n   Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMinnesota is reversed, and the case is remanded for fur\nther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

MINNESOTA\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      MINNESOTA\n\n                      [February 20, 2008] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY\njoins, dissenting.\n   Some of our new rulings on the meaning of the United\nStates Constitution apply retroactively\u2014to cases already\nconcluded\u2014and some do not. This Court has held that the\nquestion whether a particular ruling is retroactive is itself\na question of federal law. It is basic that when it comes to\nany such question of federal law, it is \u201cthe province and\nduty\u201d of this Court \u201cto say what the law is.\u201d Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). State courts are the\nfinal arbiters of their own state law; this Court is the final\narbiter of federal law. State courts are therefore bound by\nour rulings on whether our cases construing federal law\nare retroactive.\n   The majority contravenes these bedrock propositions.\nThe end result is startling: Of two criminal defendants,\neach of whom committed the same crime, at the same\ntime, whose convictions became final on the same day, and\neach of whom raised an identical claim at the same time\nunder the Federal Constitution, one may be executed\nwhile the other is set free\u2014the first despite being correct\non his claim, and the second because of it. That result is\ncontrary to the Supremacy Clause and the Framers\u2019 deci\nsion to vest in \u201cone supreme Court\u201d the responsibility and\nauthority to ensure the uniformity of federal law. Because\nthe Constitution requires us to be more jealous of that\n2                DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nresponsibility and authority, I respectfully dissent.\n                           I\n  One year after Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989)\u2014\nour leading modern precedent on retroactivity\u2014Teague\u2019s\nauthor explained:\n       \u201cThe determination whether a constitutional deci\n    sion of this Court is retroactive . . . is a matter of fed\n    eral law. When questions of state law are at issue,\n    state courts generally have the authority to determine\n    the retroactivity of their own decisions. The retroac\n    tive applicability of a constitutional decision of this\n    Court, however, \u2018is every bit as much of a federal\n    question as what particular federal constitutional\n    provisions themselves mean, what they guarantee,\n    and whether they have been denied.\u2019 \u201d American\n    Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 177\u2013178\n    (1990) (plurality opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) (quoting\n    Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 21 (1967); cita\n    tion omitted)).\nFor that reason, \u201cwe have consistently required that state\ncourts adhere to our retroactivity decisions.\u201d 496 U. S., at\n178 (citing Michigan v. Payne, 412 U. S. 47 (1973), and\nArsenault v. Massachusetts, 393 U. S. 5 (1968) (per cu\nriam)). Even more recently, we held that the \u201cSupremacy\nClause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be\nsupplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to\nretroactivity under state law.\u201d Harper v. Virginia Dept. of\nTaxation, 509 U. S. 86, 100 (1993) (citation omitted).\n   Indeed, about the only point on which our retroactivity\njurisprudence has been consistent is that the retroactivity\nof new federal rules is a question of federal law binding on\nStates. The Court\u2019s contrary holding is based on a mis\nreading of our precedent and a misunderstanding of the\nnature of retroactivity generally.\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n                              A\n   As the Court correctly points out, before 1965 we took\nfor granted the proposition that all federal constitutional\nrights, including rights that represented a break from\nearlier precedent, would be given full retroactive effect on\nboth direct and collateral review. That all changed with\nLinkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965). In that case, a\nLouisiana prisoner brought a federal habeas petition\narguing that illegally seized evidence was introduced\nagainst him at trial in violation of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.\n643 (1961). Mapp, however, had been decided after his\nconviction became final. We granted certiorari to decide\nwhether the Mapp rule \u201coperates retrospectively upon\ncases finally decided in the period prior to Mapp.\u201d 381\nU. S., at 619\u2013620. In answering this question, we broke\nfrom our past practice of assuming full retroactivity, hold\ning that \u201cwe are neither required to apply, nor prohibited\nfrom applying, a decision retrospectively.\u201d Id., at 629.\nOur analysis turned entirely on the nature and scope of\nthe particular constitutional right at issue: \u201c[W]e must . . .\nweigh the merits and demerits [of retroactive application]\nin each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in\nquestion, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective\noperation will further or retard its operation.\u201d Ibid. Un\nder this framework, we held that Mapp would apply only\nprospectively. 381 U. S., at 639\u2013640.\n   The next year, we decided Johnson v. New Jersey, 384\nU. S. 719 (1966). Johnson was a direct appeal from the\nNew Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s denial of state collateral\nrelief. The precise question in Johnson was whether the\nrules announced in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478\n(1964), and Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),\nwould apply to state prisoners whose convictions had\nbecome final before those cases were decided. In holding\nthat Escobedo and Miranda should apply only prospec\ntively, 384 U. S., at 732, we imported Linkletter\u2019s mode of\n4                 DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nretroactivity analysis into review of state postconviction\nproceedings, 384 U. S., at 726\u2013727. Finally, in Stovall v.\nDenno, 388 U. S. 293 (1967), we announced that, for pur\nposes of retroactivity analysis, \u201cno distinction is justified\nbetween convictions now final, as in the instant case, and\nconvictions at various stages of trial and direct review.\u201d\nId., at 300.\n   Thus, by 1967, the Linkletter analysis was applied in\nreview of criminal convictions, whether final or not. No\nmatter at what stage of proceedings this Court considered\na retroactivity question, the issue was decided with refer\nence to the purposes and practical impact of the precise\nfederal right in question: \u201cEach constitutional rule of\ncriminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own\nbackground of precedent, and its own impact on the ad\nministration of justice, and the way in which these factors\ncombine [to decide the retroactivity issue] must inevitably\nvary with the [constitutional] dictate involved.\u201d Johnson,\nsupra, at 728.\n   Because the question of retroactivity was so tied up with\nthe nature and purpose of the underlying federal constitu\ntional right, it would have been surprising if any of our\ncases had suggested that States were free to apply new\nrules of federal constitutional law retroactively even when\nwe would not. As one of the more thoughtful legal schol\nars put it in discussing the effect of the Linkletter analysis\non state collateral review, \u201c[i]f a state gave relief in such a\ncase on the exclusive authority of Mapp, under the ration\nale of the Linkletter opinion it would presumably have\nbeen reversed.\u201d Mishkin, Foreword: The High Court, The\nGreat Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79\nHarv. L. Rev. 56, 91, n. 132 (1965).\n   Our precedents made clear that States could give\ngreater substantive protection under their own laws than\nwas available under federal law, and could give whatever\nretroactive effect to those laws they wished. As the Court\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                   5\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nexplained in Johnson, \u201c[o]f course, States are still entirely\nfree to effectuate under their own law stricter standards\nthan those we have laid down and to apply those stan\ndards in a broader range of cases than is required by this\ndecision.\u201d 384 U. S., at 733. The clear implication of this\nstatement was that States could apply their own retroac\ntivity rules only to new substantive rights \u201cunder their\nown law,\u201d not to new federal rules announced by this\nCourt.\n   Thus, contrary to the Court\u2019s view, our early retroactiv\nity cases nowhere suggested that the retroactivity of new\nfederal constitutional rules of criminal procedure was\nanything other than \u201ca matter of federal law.\u201d Daniel v.\nLouisiana, 420 U. S. 31, 32 (1975) (per curiam). It is no\nsurprise, then, that when we held that a particular right\nwould not apply retroactively, the language in our opin\nions did not indicate that our decisions were optional. See,\ne.g., Fuller v. Alaska, 393 U. S. 80, 81 (1968) (per curiam)\n(the rule announced in Lee v. Florida, 392 U. S. 378\n(1968), \u201cis to be applied only to trials in which the evidence\nis sought to be introduced after the date of [that] decision\u201d\n(emphasis added)). And, of course, when we found that a\nstate court erred in holding that a particular right should\nnot apply retroactively, the state court was bound to com\nply. See, e.g., Kitchens v. Smith, 401 U. S. 847 (1971) (per\ncuriam); McConnell v. Rhay, 393 U. S. 2, 3\u20134 (1968) (per\ncuriam); Arsenault v. Massachusetts, 393 U. S. 5, 6 (1968)\n(per curiam).\n   Although nothing in our decisions suggested that state\ncourts could determine the retroactivity of new federal\nrules according to their own lights, we had no opportunity\nto confront the issue head on until Michigan v. Payne, 412\nU. S. 47 (1973).1 In Payne, the defendant had argued\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Payne came to us on direct appeal, but as noted, supra, at 4, we did\n\nnot at the time distinguish between direct appeal and collateral review\n6                     DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                         ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nbefore the Michigan Supreme Court that his resentencing\nviolated the rule we had announced in North Carolina v.\nPearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969). In considering this question,\nthe state court noted that this Court had \u201cnot yet decided\nwhether Pearce is to be applied retroactively.\u201d People v.\nPayne, 386 Mich. 84, 90, n. 3, 191 N. W. 2d 375, 378, n. 2\n(1971). Nevertheless, without so much as citing any fed\neral retroactivity precedent, the court decided that it\nwould \u201capply Pearce in the present case in order to in\nstruct our trial courts as to the Michigan interpretation of\nan ambiguous portion of Pearce . . . , pending clarification\nby the United States Supreme Court.\u201d Id., at 91, n. 3, 191\nN. W. 2d, at 378, n. 2.\n   We granted certiorari in Payne only on the question of\nretroactivity, and decided that Pearce should not apply\nretroactively. In reversing the contrary decision of the\nstate court, our language was not equivocal: \u201cSince the\nresentencing hearing in this case took place approximately\ntwo years before Pearce was decided, we hold that the\nMichigan Supreme Court erred in applying its proscrip\ntions here.\u201d 412 U. S., at 57.\n   The majority argues that Payne did not preclude States\nfrom applying retroactivity rules different from those we\nannounced; rather, the argument goes, the Michigan\nSupreme Court simply elected to follow the federal retro\nactivity rule, \u201cpending clarification.\u201d See ante, at 18\u201320.\nThat is certainly a possible reading of Payne, but not the\nmost plausible one. The Michigan Supreme Court did not\npurport to rest its decision to apply Pearce retroactively on\nthe federal Linkletter analysis, and this Court\u2019s reversal is\nmost reasonably read as requiring state courts to apply\nour federal retroactivity decisions. Notably, this is not the\nfirst time Members of this Court have debated the mean\ning of Payne, with Teague\u2019s author explaining that Payne\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nfor purposes of retroactivity. \n\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsupports the proposition that \u201cwe have consistently re\nquired that state courts adhere to our retroactivity deci\nsions,\u201d American Trucking, 496 U. S., at 178 (plurality\nopinion of O\u2019Connor, J.), and the author of today\u2019s opinion\ndisagreeing in dissent, see id., at 210, n. 4 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.). But whichever way Payne is read, it either\noffers no support for the majority\u2019s position, because the\nstate court simply applied federal retroactivity rules, or\nflatly rejects the majority\u2019s position, because the state\ncourt failed to apply federal retroactivity rules, and was\ntold by this Court that it must.\n   Meanwhile, Justice Harlan had begun dissenting in our\nretroactivity cases, pressing the view that new rules an\nnounced by the Court should be applied in all cases not yet\nfinal, without regard to the analysis set forth in Linkletter.\nSee Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244, 256\u2013269 (1969);\nMackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 675\u2013702 (1971)\n(opinion concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in\npart). In Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987), we\nabandoned Linkletter as it applied to cases still on direct\nreview and adopted Justice Harlan\u2019s view in such cases.\nNoting that nonretroactivity on direct appeal \u201cviolates\nbasic norms of constitutional adjudication\u201d and that \u201cse\nlective application of new rules violates the principle of\ntreating similarly situated defendants the same,\u201d 479\nU. S., at 322, 323, we held that \u201ca new rule for the conduct\nof criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all\ncases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet\nfinal,\u201d id., at 328 (emphasis added). Just as in previous\ncases, Griffith by its terms bound state courts to apply our\nretroactivity decisions.\n   Two years after Griffith was decided, we granted certio\nrari in Yates v. Aiken, 484 U. S. 211 (1988). In that case, a\nSouth Carolina state habeas court had decided that our\ndecision in Francis v. Franklin, 471 U. S. 307 (1985),\nshould not be applied retroactively. If the authority of\n8                 DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nstate courts to apply their own retroactivity rules were\nwell established under our precedents\u2014as the majority\nwould have it, see ante, at 6\u201312\u2014this case should have\nbeen easily decided on the ground that whatever the fed\neral retroactivity rule, the State could adopt its own rule\non the retroactivity of newly announced federal constitu\ntional standards.\n    Instead, the State argued to this Court \u201cthat we should\nadopt Justice Harlan\u2019s theory that a newly announced\nconstitutional rule should not be applied retroactively to\ncases pending on collateral review unless\u201d the rule meets\ncertain criteria\u2014the flip side of Justice Harlan\u2019s view\nabout cases on direct review that we had accepted in\nGriffith. 484 U. S., at 215. Under that approach, the\nState argued, Francis would not be applied retroactively\non collateral review. 484 U. S., at 215. In response, we\ndiscussed Justice Harlan\u2019s \u201cdistinction between direct\nreview and collateral review.\u201d Ibid. We found, however,\nthat it was \u201cnot necessary to determine whether we should\n. . . adopt Justice Harlan\u2019s reasoning as to the retroactivity\nof cases announcing new constitutional rules to cases\npending on collateral review,\u201d id., at 215\u2013216, because\nFrancis did not announce a new rule.\n    This Court went on, however, to address South Caro\nlina\u2019s alternative argument\u2014that it \u201chas the authority to\nestablish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings,\u201d\nwhich would allow it in the case before the Court \u201cto re\nfuse to apply a new rule of federal constitutional law\nretroactively in such a proceeding.\u201d 484 U. S., at 217.\nThis argument should sound familiar\u2014whatever the\nfederal retroactivity rule, a State may establish its own\nretroactivity rule for its own collateral proceedings. This\nCourt rejected that proposition, not only because it did not\nregard Francis as a new rule, but also because the state\ncourt did not \u201cplac[e] any limit on the issues that it will\nentertain in collateral proceedings.\u201d 484 U. S., at 218. As\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthis Court explained, if the state court \u201cconsider[s] the\nmerits of the federal claim, it has a duty to grant the relief\nthat federal law requires.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Given all this, the present case should come out the way\nit does only if Teague changed the nature of retroactivity\nas a creature of federal law binding on the States, and\nadopted the argument rejected in Yates\u2014that when it\ncomes to retroactivity, a State \u201chas the authority to estab\nlish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d\nTeague did no such thing.\n                               B\n    In Teague, we completed the project of conforming our\nview on the retroactivity of new rules of criminal proce\ndure to those of Justice Harlan. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s plu\nrality opinion posed the problem by noting, with more\nthan a bit of understatement, that the \u201cLinkletter retroac\ntivity standard has not led to consistent results.\u201d 489\nU. S., at 302. In light of these concerns, and because of\n\u201c \u2018the important distinction between direct review and\ncollateral review,\u2019 \u201d id., at 307 (quoting Yates, supra, at\n215), we generally adopted Justice Harlan\u2019s approach to\nretroactivity on collateral review, 489 U. S., at 310, just\nas we had previously adopted his approach on direct\nreview in Griffith.\n    The Linkletter approach to retroactivity was thus over\nruled in favor of the Harlan approach in two steps: Griffith\nand Teague. There is no dispute that Griffith is fully\nbinding on States; a new rule \u201cis to be applied retroac\ntively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct re\nview or not yet final.\u201d 479 U. S., at 328 (emphasis added).\nTeague is simply the other side of the coin, and it too\nshould be binding in \u201call cases, state or federal.\u201d The fact\nthat Linkletter was overruled in two stages rather than\none should not lead to a different result.\n    Indeed, Teague did not purport to distinguish between\n10                DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfederal and state collateral review. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s\nopinion noted that \u201cin Yates v. Aiken, we were asked to\ndecide whether the rule announced in Francis v. Franklin,\nshould be applied to a defendant on collateral review at\nthe time that case was decided,\u201d but that we were able to\ndecide the case on alternative grounds. 489 U. S., at 307\n(citations omitted). This citation of Yates\u2014a state habeas\ncase\u2014makes clear that Teague contemplated no difference\nbetween retroactivity of new federal rules in state and\nfederal collateral proceedings. Thus, our unqualified\nholding\u2014that \u201c[u]nless they fall within an exception to the\ngeneral rule, new constitutional rules of criminal proce\ndure will not be applicable to those cases which have\nbecome final before the new rules are announced,\u201d 489\nU. S., at 310\u2014is enough to decide this case.\n   Moreover, the reasons the Teague Court provided for\nadopting Justice Harlan\u2019s view apply to state as well as\nfederal collateral review. The majority is quite right that\nTeague invoked the interest in comity between the state\nand federal sovereigns. Id., at 308. But contrary to the\nimpression conveyed by the majority, there was more to\nTeague than that. Teague also relied on the interest in\nfinality: \u201cApplication of constitutional rules not in exis\ntence at the time a conviction became final seriously un\ndermines the principle of finality which is essential to the\noperation of our criminal justice system. Without finality,\nthe criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent ef\nfect.\u201d Id., at 309. The Court responds by flatly stating\nthat \u201cfinality of state convictions is a state interest, not a\nfederal one.\u201d Ante, at 15. But while it is certainly true\nthat finality of state convictions is a state interest, that\ndoes mean it is not also a federal one. After all, our deci\nsion in Griffith made finality the touchstone for retroactiv\nity of new federal rules, and bound States to that judg\nment. See 479 U. S., at 328 (new rules are \u201cto be applied\nretroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nreview or not yet final\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   It is quite a radical proposition to assert that this Court\nhas nothing to say about an interest \u201cessential to the\noperation of our criminal justice system,\u201d without which\n\u201cthe criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent\neffect,\u201d when the question is whether this interest is being\nundermined by the very rules of federal constitutional\nprocedure that we are charged with expounding. A State\nalone may \u201cevaluate, and weigh the importance of\u201d finality\ninterests, ante, at 15, when it decides which substantive\nrules of criminal procedure state law affords; it is quite a\nleap to hold, as the Court does, that they alone can do so\nin the name of the Federal Constitution.\n   Teague was also based on the inequity of the Linkletter\napproach to retroactivity. After noting that the disparate\ntreatment of similarly situated defendants led us in Grif\nfith to adopt Justice Harlan\u2019s view for cases on direct\nappeal, the Court then explained that the \u201cLinkletter\nstandard also led to unfortunate disparity in the treat\nment of similarly situated defendants on collateral re\nview.\u201d 489 U. S., at 305. See also id., at 316 (the Court\u2019s\nnew approach to retroactivity \u201cavoids the inequity result\ning from the uneven application of new rules to similarly\nsituated defendants\u201d).\n   This interest in reducing the inequity of haphazard\nretroactivity standards and disuniformity in the applica\ntion of federal law is quite plainly a predominantly federal\ninterest. Indeed, it was one of the main reasons we cited\nin Griffith for imposing a uniform rule of retroactivity\nupon state courts for cases on direct appeal. And, more to\nthe point, it is the very interest that animates the Su\npremacy Clause and our role as the \u201cone supreme Court\u201d\ncharged with enforcing it.\n   Justice Story, writing for the Court, noted nearly two\ncenturies ago that the Constitution requires \u201cuniformity of\ndecisions throughout the whole United States, upon all\n12                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsubjects within [its] purview.\u201d Martin v. Hunter\u2019s Lessee,\n1 Wheat. 304, 347\u2013348 (1816). Indeed, the \u201cfundamental\nprinciple\u201d of our Constitution, as Justice O\u2019Connor once\nput it, is \u201cthat a single sovereign\u2019s law should be applied\nequally to all.\u201d Our Judicial Federalism, 35 Case W. Res.\nL. Rev. 1, 4 (1985). States are free to announce their own\nstate-law rules of criminal procedure, and to apply them\nretroactively in whatever manner they like. That is fully\nconsistent with the principle that \u201ca single sovereign\u2019s law\nshould be applied equally to all.\u201d But the Court\u2019s opinion\ninvites just the sort of disuniformity in federal law that\nthe Supremacy Clause was meant to prevent. The same\ndetermination of a federal constitutional violation at the\nsame stage in the criminal process can result in freedom\nin one State and loss of liberty or life in a neighboring\nState.2 The Court\u2019s opinion allows \u201ca single sovereign\u2019s\nlaw\u201d\u2014the Federal Constitution, as interpreted by this\nCourt\u2014to be applied differently in every one of the several\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court points out that the defendants in such a case are differ\n\nently situated because they violated the laws of and were tried in\ndifferent States. Ante, at 26. But disparate treatment under substan\ntively different state laws is something we expect in our federal system;\ndisparate treatment under the same Federal Constitution is quite a\ndifferent matter.\n   The majority also points out that the rule announced in Griffith v.\nKentucky, 479 U. S. 314 (1987)\u2014that full retroactive application ends\nwith the conclusion of direct appeal\u2014creates its own disuniformity,\nbecause finality turns on how quickly a State brings its direct appeals\nto a close. Ante, at 27. The same point was raised by the Griffith\ndissenters, 479 U. S., at 331\u2013332 (opinion of White, J.), and rejected as\npertinent by the majority in that case, id., at 327\u2013328. The disuni\nformity that the majority emphasizes today and the dissenters empha\nsized in Griffith is a necessary consequence of our having chosen a\nrelatively clear rule\u2014finality\u2014to delineate the line between full retro\nactivity and presumptive nonretroactivity. The relevant point is that\nwhatever inequity arises from the Griffith rule, it is based on a balanc\ning of costs and benefits that this Court\u2014not 50 different sovereigns\u2014\nhas performed.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nStates.\n   Finally, from Linkletter through Johnson to Teague, we\nhave always emphasized that determining whether a new\nfederal right is retroactive turns on the nature of the\nsubstantive federal rule at issue. See Linkletter, 381 U. S.,\nat 629 (in deciding retroactivity, we \u201cloo[k] to the prior\nhistory of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and\nwhether retrospective operation will further or retard its\noperation\u201d); Johnson, 384 U. S., at 728 (\u201cEach constitu\ntional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct\nfunctions, its own background of precedent, and its own\nimpact on the administration of justice, and the way in\nwhich these factors combine [to decide the retroactivity\nissue] must inevitably vary with the dictate involved\u201d);\nTeague, supra, at 311\u2013315 (deciding whether rule is appli\ncable to cases on collateral review turns on whether the\nrule \u201cplaces \u2018certain kinds of primary, private individual\nconduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making\nauthority to proscribe,\u2019 \u201d and whether the rule is an \u201cabso\nlute prerequisite to fundamental fairness that is \u2018implicit\nin the concept of ordered liberty\u2019 \u201d). That is how we deter\nmine retroactivity\u2014by carefully examining the underlying\nfederal right. See, e.g., Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U. S. ___,\n___\u2013___ (2007) (slip op., at 11\u201314); Schriro v. Summerlin,\n542 U. S. 348, 353\u2013354 (2004); Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S.\n227, 243\u2013245 (1990); Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302,\n318\u2013319 (1989).\n   When this Court decides that a particular right shall not\nbe applied retroactively, but a state court finds that it\nshould, it is at least in part because of a different assess\nment by the state court of the nature of the underlying\nfederal right\u2014something on which the Constitution gives\nthis Court the final say. The nature and scope of the new\nrules we announce directly determines whether they will\nbe applied retroactively on collateral review. Today\u2019s\nopinion stands for the unfounded proposition that while\n14                DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nwe alone have the final say in expounding the former, we\nhave no control over the latter.\n                                II\n   The Court\u2019s holding is not only based on a misreading of\nour retroactivity cases, but also on a misunderstanding of\nthe nature of retroactivity generally. The majority\u2019s deci\nsion is grounded on the erroneous view that retroactivity\nis a remedial question. See ante, at 26\u201327 (\u201cIt is impor\ntant to keep in mind that our jurisprudence concerning the\n\u2018retroactivity\u2019 of \u2018new rules\u2019 of constitutional law is primar\nily concerned, not with the question whether a constitu\ntional violation occurred, but with the availability or\nnonavailability of remedies\u201d). But as explained in the lead\nopinion in American Trucking\u2014penned by the author of\nthe lead opinion in Teague\u2014it is an \u201cerror\u201d to \u201cequat[e] a\ndecision not to apply a rule retroactively with the judicial\nchoice of a remedy.\u201d 496 U. S., at 194 (plurality opinion of\nO\u2019Connor, J.). As Justice O\u2019Connor went on to emphasize,\n\u201c[n]or do this Court\u2019s retroactivity decisions, whether in\nthe civil or criminal sphere, support the . . . assertion that\nour retroactivity doctrine is a remedial principle.\u201d Ibid.\n\u201cWhile application of the principles of retroactivity may\nhave remedial effects, they are not themselves remedial\nprinciples. . . . A decision defining the operative conduct or\nevents that will be adjudicated under old law does not, in\nitself, specify an appropriate remedy.\u201d Id., at 195. See\nalso Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U. S. 192, 199 (1973) (plural\nity opinion) (describing the question of retroactivity as\n\u201cwhether we will apply a new constitutional rule of crimi\nnal law in reviewing judgments of conviction obtained\nunder a prior standard,\u201d and contrasting this with the\nquestion of the \u201cappropriate scope of federal equitable\nremedies\u201d).\n   In other words, when we ask whether and to what ex\ntent a rule will be retroactively applied, we are asking\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nwhat law\u2014new or old\u2014will apply. As we have expressly\nnoted, \u201c[t]he Teague doctrine . . . does not involve a special\n\u2018remedial\u2019 limitation on the principle of \u2018retroactivity\u2019 as\nmuch as it reflects a limitation inherent in the principle\nitself.\u201d Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514 U. S. 749,\n758 (1995).\n   The foregoing prompts a lengthy rejoinder from the\nCourt, to the effect that it is wrong to view retroactivity as\na federal choice-of-law question rather than a remedial\none. That view, we are told, was rejected by five Justices\nin American Trucking and then by the Court in Harper.\nAnte, at 20\u201324. But the proposition on which five Mem\nbers of the Court agreed in American Trucking, and that\nthe Court adopted in Harper, was that the Griffith rule of\nretroactivity\u2014that is, that newly announced constitu\ntional decisions should apply to all cases on direct re\nview\u2014should apply to civil cases as well as criminal. See\nAmerican Trucking, 496 U. S., at 201 (SCALIA, J., concur\nring in judgment) (\u201cI share JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 perception\nthat prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the\njudicial role, which is to say what the law is, not to pre\nscribe what it shall be\u201d); id., at 212 (STEVENS, J., dissent\ning) (\u201cFundamental notions of fairness and legal process\ndictate that the same rules should be applied to all similar\ncases on direct review\u201d); Harper, 509 U. S., at 97 (\u201cWhen\nthis Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties\nbefore it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of\nfederal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all\ncases still open on direct review\u201d).\n   Neither JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence in American\nTrucking combined with the dissent, nor the Court\u2019s opin\nion in Harper, resolved that retroactivity was a remedial\nquestion. That is why, the year after American Trucking\nwas decided, two of the Justices in today\u2019s majority could\nexplain:\n16                DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n     \u201cSince the question is whether the court should apply\n     the old rule or the new one, retroactivity is properly\n     seen in the first instance as a matter of choice of law,\n     \u2018a choice . . . between the principle of forward opera\n     tion and that of relation backward.\u2019 Great Northern\n     R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U. S. 358,\n     364 (1932). Once a rule is found to apply \u2018backward,\u2019\n     there may then be a further issue of remedies, i.e.,\n     whether the party prevailing under a new rule should\n     obtain the same relief that would have been awarded\n     if the rule had been an old one. Subject to possible\n     constitutional thresholds, the remedial inquiry is one\n     governed by state law, at least where the case origi\n     nates in state court. See American Trucking Assns.,\n     Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 210 (1990) (STEVENS, J.,\n     dissenting). But the antecedent choice-of-law question\n     is a federal one where the rule at issue itself derives\n     from federal law, constitutional or otherwise. See\n     Smith, supra, at 177\u2013178 (plurality opinion).\u201d James\n     B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529, 534\u2013\n     535 (1991) (opinion of SOUTER, J., joined by STEVENS,\n     J.) (citation omitted; emphasis added).\n   And Harper certainly did not view the retroactivity of\nfederal rules as a remedial question for state courts.\nQuite the contrary: Harper held that the \u201cSupremacy\nClause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be\nsupplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to\nretroactivity under state law,\u201d 509 U. S., at 100 (citation\nomitted), and expressly treated retroactivity and remedy\nas separate questions, id., at 100\u2013102.\n   The majority explains that when we announce a new\nrule of law, we are not \u201c \u2018creating the law,\u2019 \u201d but rather\n\u201c \u2018declaring what the law already is.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 21 (quoting\nAmerican Trucking, supra, at 201 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin judgment)). But this has nothing to do with the ques\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntion before us. The point may lead to the conclusion that\nnonretroactivity of our decisions is improper\u2014the position\nthe Court has adopted in both criminal and civil cases on\ndirect review\u2014but everyone agrees that full retroactivity\nis not required on collateral review. It necessarily follows\nthat we must choose whether \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cold\u201d law applies to\na particular category of cases. Suppose, for example, that\na defendant, whose conviction became final before we\nannounced our decision in Crawford v. Washington, 541\nU. S. 36 (2004), argues (correctly) on collateral review that\nhe was convicted in violation of both Crawford and Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), the case that Crawford over\nruled. Under our decision in Whorton v. Bockting, 549\nU. S. ___ (2007), the \u201cnew\u201d rule announced in Crawford\nwould not apply retroactively to the defendant. But I take\nit to be uncontroversial that the defendant would never\ntheless get the benefit of the \u201cold\u201d rule of Roberts, even\nunder the view that the rule not only is but always has\nbeen an incorrect reading of the Constitution. See, e.g.,\nYates, 484 U. S., at 218. Thus, the question whether a\nparticular federal rule will apply retroactively is, in a very\nreal way, a choice between new and old law. The issue in\nthis case is who should decide.\n   The proposition that the question of retroactivity\u2014that\nis, the choice between new or old law in a particular case\u2014\nis distinct from the question of remedies has several im\nportant implications for this case. To begin with, what\never intuitive appeal may lie in the majority\u2019s statement\nthat \u201cthe remedy a state court chooses to provide its citi\nzens for violations of the Federal Constitution is primarily\na question of state law,\u201d ante, at 24, the statement misses\nthe mark. The relevant inquiry is not about remedy; it is\nabout choice of law\u2014new or old. There is no reason to\nbelieve, either legally or intuitively, that States should\nhave any authority over this question when it comes to\nwhich federal constitutional rules of criminal procedure to\n18                   DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\napply.3\n   Indeed, when the question is what federal rule of deci\nsion from this Court should apply to a particular case, no\nCourt but this one\u2014which has the ultimate authority \u201cto\nsay what the law is,\u201d Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 177\u2014should\nhave final say over the answer. See Harper, supra, at 100\n(\u201cSupremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity\ndoctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary\napproach to retroactivity under state law\u201d (citation omit\nted)). This is enough to rebut the proposition that there is\nno \u201csource of [our] authority\u201d to bind state courts to follow\nour retroactivity decisions. Ante, at 26. Retroactivity is a\nquestion of federal law, and our final authority to construe\nit cannot, at this point in the Nation\u2019s history, be reasona\nbly doubted.\n   Principles of federalism protect the prerogative of States\nto extend greater rights under their own laws than are\navailable under federal law. The question here, however,\nis the availability of protection under the Federal Consti\ntution\u2014specifically, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment. It is no intrusion on the prerogatives of the\nStates to recognize that it is for this Court to decide such a\nquestion of federal law, and that our decision is binding on\nthe States under the Supremacy Clause.\n   Consider the flip side of the question before us today: If\na State interprets its own constitution to provide protec\ntion beyond that available under the Federal Constitution,\nand has ruled that this interpretation is not retroactive,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3A  federal court applying state law under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n304 U. S. 64 (1938), follows state choice-of-law rules as well, see Klaxon\nCo. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487, 496 (1941). It is not free to\nfollow its own federal rule simply because the issue arises in federal\ncourt. By the same token, a state court considering a federal constitu\ntional claim on collateral review should follow the federal rule on\nwhether new or old law applies. It is not free to follow its own state-law\nview on the question simply because the issue arises in state court.\n                     Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                   19\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nno one would suppose that a federal court could hold\notherwise, and grant relief under state law that a state\ncourt would refuse to grant. The result should be the\nsame when a state court is asked to give retroactive effect\nto a right under the Federal Constitution that this Court\nhas held is not retroactive.\n   The distinction between retroactivity and available\nremedies highlights the fact that the majority\u2019s assertion\n\u201cthat Teague\u2019s general rule of nonretroactivity was an\nexercise of this Court\u2019s power to interpret the federal\nhabeas statute,\u201d ante, at 13\u2014even if correct\u2014is neither\nhere nor there.4 While Congress has substantial control\nover federal courts\u2019 ability to grant relief for violations of\nthe Federal Constitution, the Constitution gives us the\nresponsibility to decide what its provisions mean. And\nwith that responsibility necessarily comes the authority to\ndetermine the scope of those provisions\u2014when they apply\nand when they do not.\n   This proposition\u2014and the importance of the distinction\nbetween retroactivity and available remedies\u2014were con\nfirmed when we considered the availability of federal\ncollateral review of state convictions under the Antiterror\nism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). Whatever control Congress\nhas over federal courts\u2019 ability to grant postconviction\nremedies, the availability or scope of those remedies has\nno bearing on our decisions about whether new or old law\nshould apply in a particular case. That is why, after\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority\u2019s assertion, however, is a bit of an overstatement.\nTeague would be an odd form of statutory interpretation; 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254 is cited once in passing, 489 U. S., at 298, and \u00a72243\u2014the statute\nthat the Court believes Teague was interpreting\u2014is not cited at all. As\nsupport for its proposition, the Court cites several cases having nothing\nto do with retroactivity, and numerous concurring and dissenting\nopinions that did not command a majority. See ante, at 14\u201315, and\nn. 15.\n20               DANFORTH v. MINNESOTA\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nAEDPA\u2019s passage, we view the Teague inquiry as distinct\nfrom that under AEDPA. See Horn v. Banks, 536 U. S.\n266, 272 (2002) (per curiam) (\u201cWhile it is of course a nec\nessary prerequisite to federal habeas relief that a prisoner\nsatisfy the AEDPA standard of review set forth in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d), . . . none of our post-AEDPA cases have\nsuggested that a writ of habeas corpus should automati\ncally issue if a prisoner satisfies the AEDPA standard, or\nthat AEDPA relieves courts from the responsibility of\naddressing properly raised Teague arguments\u201d). The\nmajority today views the issue as simply one of what\nremedies a State chooses to apply; our cases confirm that\nthe question whether a federal decision is retroactive is\none of federal law distinct from the issue of available\nremedies.\n   Lurking behind today\u2019s decision is of course the question\nof just how free state courts are to define the retroactivity\nof our decisions interpreting the Federal Constitution. I\ndo not see any basis in the majority\u2019s logic for concluding\nthat States are free to hold our decisions retroactive when\nwe have held they are not, but not free to hold that they\nare not when we have held they are. Under the majority\u2019s\nreasoning, in either case the availability of relief in state\ncourt is a question for those courts to evaluate independ\nently. The majority carefully reserves that question, see\nante, at 4, n. 4, confirming that the majority regards it as\nopen.\n   Nor is there anything in today\u2019s decision suggesting that\nStates could not adopt more nuanced approaches to retro\nactivity. For example, suppose we hold that the Sixth\nAmendment right to be represented by particular counsel\nof choice, recently announced in United States v. Gonzalez-\nLopez, 548 U. S. 140 (2006), is a new rule that does not\napply retroactively. Under the majority\u2019s rationale, a\nstate court could decide that it nonetheless will apply\nGonzalez-Lopez retroactively, but only if the defendant\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           21\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncould prove prejudice, or some other criterion we had\nrejected as irrelevant in defining the substantive right.\nUnder the majority\u2019s logic, that would not be a misapplica\ntion of our decision in Gonzalez-Lopez\u2014which specifically\nrejected any required showing of prejudice, id., at 147\u2013\n148\u2014but simply a state decision on the scope of available\nremedies in state court. The possible permutations\u2014from\nState to State, and federal right to federal right\u2014are\nendless.\n                        *     *     *\n   Perhaps all this will be dismissed as fine parsing of\nsomewhat arcane precedents, over which reasonable\njudges may disagree. Fair enough; but I would hope that\nenough has been said at least to refute the majority\u2019s\nassertion that its conclusion is dictated by our prior cases.\nThis dissent is compelled not simply by disagreement over\nhow to read those cases, but by the fundamental issues at\nstake\u2014our role under the Constitution as the final arbiter\nof federal law, both as to its meaning and its reach, and\nthe accompanying duty to ensure the uniformity of that\nfederal law.\n   Stephen Danforth\u2019s conviction became final before the\nnew rule in Crawford was announced. In Whorton v. Bock\nting, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), we held that Crawford shall not\nbe applied retroactively on collateral review. That should\nbe the end of the matter. I respectfully dissent.\n",

The State Supreme Court granted review to consider two arguments: (1) that the lower courts erred in holding that <i>Crawford</i> did not apply retroactively under <i>Teague;</i> and (2) that the state court was \"free to apply a broader retroactivity standard than that of <i>Teague,</i>\" and should apply the <i>Crawford</i> rule to petitioner's case even if federal law did not require it to do so. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1232779\"><a href=\"/opinion/1232779/danforth-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, 455 (2006).

Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007), makes clear that the Minnesota court correctly concluded that federal law does not <i>require</i> state courts to apply the holding in <i>Crawford</i> to cases that were final when that case was decided. Nevertheless, we granted certiorari, 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2427, 167 L.Ed.2d 1129 (2007), to consider whether <i>Teague</i> or any other federal rule of law <i>prohibits</i> them from doing so.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We begin with a comment on the source of the \"new rule\" announced in <i>Crawford.</i> For much of our Nation's history, federal constitutional rights\u0097such as the Sixth Amendment confrontation right at issue in <i>Crawford</i>\u0097were not binding on the States. Federal law, in fact, imposed no constraints on the procedures that state courts could or should follow in imposing criminal sanctions on their citizens. Neither the Federal Constitution as originally ratified nor any of the Amendments added by the Bill of Rights in 1791 gave this Court or any other federal-court power to review the fairness of state criminal procedures. Moreover, before 1867 the statutory authority of federal district courts to issue writs of habeas corpus did not extend to convicted criminals in state custody. See Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, \u00a7 1, 14 Stat. 385.</p>\n<p>The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment radically changed the federal courts' relationship with state courts. That Amendment, one of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments ratified in 1868, is the source of this Court's power to decide whether a defendant in a state proceeding received a fair trial\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> whether his deprivation of liberty was \"without due process of law.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1 (\"[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\"). In construing that Amendment, we have held that it imposes minimum standards of fairness on the States, and requires state criminal trials to provide defendants with protections \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" <i>Palko v. Connecticut,</i> 302 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1035</span> U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937).</p>\n<p>Slowly at first, and then at an accelerating pace in the 1950's and 1960's, the Court held that safeguards afforded by the Bill of Rights\u0097including a defendant's Sixth Amendment right \"to be confronted with the witnesses against him\"\u0097are incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and are therefore binding upon the States. See <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106545\"><a href=\"/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963) (applying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the States); <i>Pointer v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107014\"><a href=\"/opinion/107014/pointer-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span>, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) (holding that \"the Sixth Amendment's right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is likewise a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment\"). Our interpretation of that basic Sixth Amendment right of confrontation has evolved over the years.</p>\n<p>In <i>Crawford</i> we accepted the petitioner's argument that the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation that we had previously endorsed in <i>Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, needed reconsideration because it \"stray[ed] from the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause.\" 541 U.S., at 42, 124 S.Ct. 1354. We \"turn[ed] to the historical background of the Clause to understand its meaning,\" <i>id.,</i> at 43, 124 S.Ct. 1354, and relied primarily on legal developments that had occurred prior to the adoption of the Sixth Amendment to derive the correct interpretation. <i>Id.,</i> at 43-50, 124 S.Ct. 1354. We held that the \"Constitution prescribes a procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less than the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of our own devising.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 67, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p>Thus, our opinion in <i>Crawford</i> announced a \"new rule\"\u0097as that term is defined in <i>Teague</i>\u0097because the result in that case \"was not <i>dictated</i> by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final,\" <i>Teague,</i> 489 U.S., at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). It was not, however, a rule \"of our own devising\" or the product of our own views about sound policy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Our decision today must also be understood against the backdrop of our somewhat confused and confusing \"retroactivity\" cases decided in the years between 1965 and 1987. Indeed, we note at the outset that the very word \"retroactivity\" is misleading because it speaks in temporal terms. \"Retroactivity\" suggests that when we declare that a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is \"nonretroactive,\" we are implying that the right at issue was not in existence prior to the date the \"new rule\" was announced. But this is incorrect. As we have already explained, the source of a \"new rule\" is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law. Accordingly, the underlying right necessarily pre-exists our articulation of the new rule. What we are actually determining when we assess the \"retroactivity\" of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1036</span> Originally, criminal defendants whose convictions were final were entitled to federal habeas relief only if the court that rendered the judgment under which they were in custody lacked jurisdiction to do so. <i>Ex parte Watkins,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span>, 7 L.Ed. 650 (1830); <i>Ex parte Lange,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88804\"><a href=\"/opinion/88804/ex-parte-lange/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 176, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1874); <i>Ex parte Siebold,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90042\"><a href=\"/opinion/90042/ex-parte-siebold/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 376-377, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880).<sup>[6]</sup> In 1915, the realm of violations for which federal habeas relief would be available to state prisoners was expanded to include state proceedings that \"deprive[d] the accused of his life or liberty without due process of law.\" <i>Frank v.

In the early 1900's, however, such relief was only granted when the constitutional violation was so serious that it effectively rendered the conviction void for lack of jurisdiction. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Moore v.

Nevertheless, until 1965 the Court continued to construe every constitutional error, including newly announced ones, as entitling state prisoners to relief on federal habeas. \"New\" constitutional rules of criminal procedure were, without discussion or analysis, routinely applied to cases on habeas review.

Adopting a practical approach, we held that the retroactive effect of each new rule should be determined on a case-by-case basis by examining the purpose of the rule, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1037</span> reliance of the States on the prior law, and the effect on the administration of justice of retroactive application of the rule. <i>Id.,</i> at 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731.

In <i>Teague,</i> Justice O'Connor reaffirmed <i>Griffith'</i>s rejection of the <i>Linkletter</i> standard for determining the \"retroactive\" applicability of new rules to state convictions that were not yet final and rejected the <i>Linkletter</i> standard for cases pending on federal habeas review. She adopted (with a significant modification) the approach advocated by Justice Harlan for federal collateral review of final state judgments.</p>\n<p>Justice O'Connor endorsed a general rule of nonretroactivity for cases on collateral <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1038</span> review, stating that \"[u]nless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.\" 489 U.S., at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). The opinion defined two exceptions: rules that render types of primary conduct \"`beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060, and \"watershed\" rules that \"implicate the fundamental fairness of the trial,\" <i>id.,</i> at 311, 312, 313, 109 S.Ct. 1060.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>It is clear that <i>Linkletter</i> and then <i>Teague</i> considered what constitutional violations may be remedied on federal habeas.<sup>[11]</sup> They did not define the scope of the \"new\" constitutional rights themselves. Nor, as we shall explain, did <i>Linkletter</i> or <i>Teague</i> (or any of the other cases relied upon by respondent and the Minnesota Supreme Court) speak to the entirely separate question whether States can provide remedies for violations of these rights in their own postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Neither <i>Linkletter</i> nor <i>Teague</i> explicitly or implicitly constrained the authority of the States to provide remedies for a broader range of constitutional violations than are redressable on federal habeas. <i>Linkletter</i> spoke in broad terms about the retroactive applicability of new rules to state convictions that had become final prior to our announcement of the rules. Although <i>Linkletter</i> arose on federal habeas, the opinion did not rely on that procedural posture as a factor in its holding or analysis. Arguably, therefore, the approach it established might have been applied with equal force to both federal and state courts reviewing final state convictions. But we did not state\u0097and the state courts did not conclude\u0097that <i>Linkletter</i> imposed such a limitation on the States.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>A year after deciding <i>Linkletter,</i> we granted certiorari in <i>Johnson</i> to address the retroactivity of the rules announced in <i>Escobedo v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106883\"><a href=\"/opinion/106883/escobedo-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), and <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Applying the standard announced in <i>Linkletter,</i> we held that those rules should be applied only to trials that began after the respective dates of those decisions; they were given no retroactive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1039</span> effect beyond the parties in <i>Miranda</i> and <i>Escobedo</i> themselves.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>Notably, the Oregon Supreme Court decided to give retroactive effect to <i>Escobedo</i> despite our holding in <i>Johnson.</i> In <i>State v. Fair,</i> 263 Ore. 383, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1239738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1239738/state-v-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span> (1972), the Oregon court noted that it was continuing to apply <i>Escobedo</i> retroactively and correctly stated that \"we are free to choose the degree of retroactivity or prospectivity which we believe appropriate to the particular rule under consideration, so long as we give federal constitutional rights at least as broad a scope as the United States Supreme Court requires.\" 263 Ore., at 387-388, 502 P.2d, at 1152. In so holding, the Oregon court cited our language in <i>Johnson</i> that \"`States are still entirely free to effectuate under their own law stricter standards than those we have laid down and to apply those standards in a broader range of cases than is required by this decision.'\" 263 Ore., at 386, 502 P.2d, at 1151 (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 384 U.S., at 733, 86 S.Ct. 1772).<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>Like <i>Linkletter, Teague</i> arose on federal habeas. Unlike in <i>Linkletter,</i> however, this procedural posture was not merely a background fact in <i>Teague.</i> A close reading of the <i>Teague</i> opinion makes clear that the rule it established was tailored to the unique context of federal habeas and therefore had no bearing on whether States could provide broader relief in their own postconviction proceedings than required by that opinion. Because the case before us now does not involve either of the \"<i>Teague</i> exceptions,\" it is Justice O'Connor's discussion of the general rule of nonretroactivity that merits the following three comments.</p>\n<p>First, not a word in Justice O'Connor's discussion\u0097or in either of the opinions of Justice Harlan that provided the blueprint for her entire analysis\u0097asserts or even intimates that her definition of the class eligible for relief under a new rule should inhibit the authority of any state agency or state court to extend the benefit of a new rule to a broader class than she defined.</p>\n<p>Second, Justice O'Connor's opinion clearly indicates that <i>Teague</i>'s general rule of nonretroactivity was an exercise of this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1040</span> Court's power to interpret the federal habeas statute. Chapter 153 of Title 28 of the U.S.Code gives federal courts the authority to grant \"writs of habeas corpus,\" but leaves unresolved many important questions about the scope of available relief. This Court has interpreted that congressional silence\u0097along with the statute's command to dispose of habeas petitions \"as law and justice require,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243\u0097as an authorization to adjust the scope of the writ in accordance with equitable and prudential considerations.

Justice O'Connor made numerous references to the \"Great writ\" and the \"writ,\" and expressly stated that \"[t]he relevant frame of reference\" for determining the appropriate retroactivity rule is defined by \"the purposes for which the writ of habeas corpus is made available.\" 489 U.S., at 306, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). Moreover, she justified the general rule of nonretroactivity in part by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1041</span> reference to comity and respect for the finality of state convictions. Federalism and comity considerations are unique to <i>federal</i> habeas review of state convictions. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v. Preciose,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2309234\"><a href=\"/opinion/2309234/state-v-preciose/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, 475, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2309234\"><a href=\"/opinion/2309234/state-v-preciose/\"><span class=\"volume\">609</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span>, 1292 (1992) (explaining that comity and federalism concerns \"simply do not apply when this Court reviews procedural rulings by our lower courts\"). If anything, considerations of comity militate in favor of allowing state courts to grant habeas relief to a broader class of individuals than is required by <i>Teague.</i> And while finality is, of course, implicated in the context of state as well as federal habeas, finality of state convictions is a <i>state</i> interest, not a federal one. It is a matter that States should be free to evaluate, and weigh the importance of, when prisoners held in state custody are seeking a remedy for a violation of federal rights by their lower courts.</p>\n<p>The dissent correctly points out that <i>Teague</i> was also grounded in concerns over uniformity and the inequity inherent in the <i>Linkletter</i> approach. There is, of course, a federal interest in \"reducing the inequity of haphazard retroactivity standards and disuniformity in the application of federal law.\" <i>Post,</i> at 1053. This interest in uniformity, however, does not outweigh the general principle that States are independent sovereigns with plenary authority to make and enforce their own laws as long as they do not infringe on federal constitutional guarantees. The fundamental interest in federalism that allows individual States to define crimes, punishments, rules of evidence, and rules of criminal and civil procedure in a variety of different ways\u0097so long as they do not violate the Federal Constitution\u0097is not otherwise limited by any general, undefined federal interest in uniformity. Nonuniformity is, in fact, an unavoidable reality in a federalist system of government. Any State could surely have adopted the rule of evidence defined in <i>Crawford</i> under state law even if that case had never been decided. It should be equally free to give its citizens the benefit of our rule in any fashion that does not offend federal law.</p>\n<p>It is thus abundantly clear that the <i>Teague</i> rule of non-retroactivity was fashioned to achieve the goals of federal habeas while minimizing federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings. It was intended to limit the authority of federal courts to overturn state convictions\u0097not to limit a state court's authority to grant relief for violations of new rules of constitutional law when reviewing its own State's convictions.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Our subsequent cases, which characterize the <i>Teague</i> rule as a standard limiting only the scope of <i>federal</i> habeas relief, confirm that <i>Teague</i> speaks only to the context of federal habeas. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Beard v. Banks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136998\"><a href=\"/opinion/136998/beard-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 412, 124 S.Ct. 2504, 159 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004) (\"<i>Teague</i>'s nonretroactivity principle acts as a limitation on the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief to state prisoners\" (internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and brackets omitted)); <i>Caspari,</i> 510 U.S., at 389, 114 S.Ct. 948 (\"The <i>[Teague]</i> nonretroactivity principle <i>prevents</i> a federal court from granting habeas corpus relief to a state <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1042</span> prisoner based on a rule announced after his conviction and sentence became final\").</p>\n<p>It is also noteworthy that for many years following <i>Teague,</i> state courts almost universally understood the <i>Teague</i> rule as binding only federal habeas courts, not state courts.

Lane</i> on State Postconviction Remedies, 44 Ala. L.Rev. 421, 423-424, 422-423 (1993).</p>\n<p>In sum, the <i>Teague</i> decision limits the kinds of constitutional violations that will entitle an individual to relief on federal habeas, but does not in any way limit the authority of a state court, when reviewing its own state criminal convictions, to provide a remedy for a violation that is deemed \"nonretroactive\" under <i>Teague.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>The State contends that two of our prior decisions\u0097<i>Michigan v. Payne</i> and <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith</i>\u0097cast doubt on state courts' authority to provide broader remedies for federal constitutional violations than mandated by <i>Teague.</i> We disagree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Michigan v. Payne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108794\"><a href=\"/opinion/108794/michigan-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736, we considered the retroactivity of the rule prohibiting \"vindictive\" resentencing that had been announced in our opinion in <i>North Carolina v. Pearce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, 723-726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969).<sup>[18]</sup> Relying on the approach set forth in <i>Linkletter</i> and <i>Stovall,</i> we held that the <i>Pearce</i> rule did not apply because Payne's resentencing had occurred prior to <i>Pearce</i>'s date of decision.<sup>[19]</sup> We therefore reversed the judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court, which had applied <i>Pearce</i> retroactively, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p>At first blush the fact that we reversed the judgment of the Michigan court appears to lend support to the view that state courts may not give greater retroactive effect to new rules announced by this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1043</span> Court than we expressly authorize. But, as our opinion in <i>Payne</i> noted, the Michigan Supreme Court had applied the <i>Pearce</i> rule retroactively \"`pending clarification'\" by this Court. 412 U.S., at 49, 93 S.Ct. 1966. As the Michigan Court explained, it had applied the new rule in the case before it in order to give guidance to Michigan trial courts concerning what it regarded as an ambiguity in <i>Pearce</i>'s new rule.<sup>[20]</sup> The Michigan Court did not purport to make a definitive ruling on the retroactivity of <i>Pearce;</i> nor did it purport to apply a broader state rule of retroactivity than required by federal law. Our opinion in <i>Payne</i> did not require the Michigan Supreme Court to modify its disposition of the case; it simply remanded for further proceedings after providing the clarification that the Michigan Court sought. Most significantly, other than the fact that the case was remanded for further proceedings, not a word in our <i>Payne</i> opinion suggests that the Court intended to prohibit state courts from applying new constitutional standards in a broader range of cases than we require.<sup>[21]</sup></p>\n<p>Notably, at least some state courts continued, after <i>Payne,</i> to adopt and apply broader standards of retroactivity than required by our decisions. In <i>Pennsylvania v. McCormick,</i> 359 Pa.Super. 461, 470, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1516600\"><a href=\"/opinion/1516600/com-v-mccormick/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 447 (1986), for example, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania chose not to follow this Court's nonretroactivity holding in <i>Allen v.

While their suit was pending, this Court declared a virtually identical Pennsylvania tax unconstitutional. See <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111942\"><a href=\"/opinion/111942/american-trucking-assns-inc-v-scheiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 2829, 97 L.Ed.2d 226 (1987). Shortly <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1044</span> thereafter, the Arkansas Supreme Court struck down the Arkansas tax at issue. The primary issue in <i>Smith</i> was whether petitioners were entitled to a refund of taxes that were assessed before the date of our decision in <i>Scheiner.</i></p>\n<p>The Arkansas Court held that petitioners were not entitled to a refund because our decision in <i>Scheiner</i> did not apply retroactively. Four Members of this Court agreed. The plurality opinion concluded that federal law did not provide petitioners with a right to a refund of pre-<i>Scheiner</i> tax payments because <i>Scheiner</i> did not apply retroactively to invalidate the Arkansas tax prior to its date of decision. Four Members of this Court dissented. The dissenting opinion argued that the case actually raised both the substantive question whether the tax violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution and the remedial question whether, if so, the petitioners were entitled to a refund. The dissent concluded as a matter of federal law that the tax was invalid during the years before <i>Scheiner,</i> and that petitioners were entitled to a decision to that effect. Whether petitioners should get a refund, however, the dissent deemed a mixed question of state and federal law that should be decided by the state court in the first instance.</p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA concurred with the plurality's judgment because he disagreed with the substantive rule announced in <i>Scheiner,</i> but he did not agree with the plurality's reasoning. After stating that his views on retroactivity diverged from the plurality's \"in a fundamental way,\" Justice SCALIA explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\"I share [the dissent's] perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role, which is to say what the law is, not to prescribe what [the law] shall be. The very framing of the issue that we purport to decide to-day \u0097whether our decision in <i>Scheiner</i> shall `apply' retroactively\u0097presupposes a view of our decisions as <i>creating</i> the law, as opposed to <i>declaring</i> what the law already is. Such a view is contrary to that understanding of `the judicial Power,' U.S. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 1, which is not only the common and traditional one, but which is the only one that can justify courts in denying force and effect to the unconstitutional enactments of duly elected legislatures, see <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137[, 2 L.Ed. 60] (1803)\u0097the very exercise of judicial power asserted in <i>Scheiner.</i> To hold a governmental Act to be unconstitutional is not to announce that <i>we</i> forbid it, but that the <i>Constitution</i> forbids it; and when, as in this case, the constitutionality of a state statute is placed in issue, the question is not whether some decision of ours `applies' in the way that a law applies; the question is whether the Constitution, as interpreted in that decision, invalidates the statute. Since the Constitution does not change from year to year; since it does not conform to our decisions, but our decisions are supposed to conform to it; the notion that our interpretation of the Constitution in a particular decision could take prospective form does not make sense. Either enforcement of the statute at issue in <i>Scheiner</i> (which occurred before our decision there) was unconstitutional, or it was not; if it was, then so is enforcement of all identical statutes in other States, whether occurring before or after our decision; and if it was not, then <i>Scheiner</i> was wrong, and the issue of whether to `apply' that decision needs no further attention.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323.</blockquote>\n<p>Because Justice SCALIA's vote rested on his disagreement with the substantive rule announced in <i>Scheiner</i>\u0097rather than with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1045</span> the retroactivity analysis in the dissenting opinion\u0097there were actually five votes supporting the dissent's views on the retroactivity issue. Accordingly, it is the dissent rather than the plurality that should inform our analysis of the issue before us today.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, several years later, a majority of this Court explicitly adopted the <i>Smith</i> dissent's reasoning in <i>Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112890\"><a href=\"/opinion/112890/harper-v-virginia-dept-of-taxation/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). <i>Harper,</i> like <i>Smith,</i> involved a request for a refund of taxes paid before we declared a similar Michigan tax unconstitutional. We held that the Virginia tax at issue in <i>Harper</i> was in fact invalid\u0097even before we declared the similar tax unconstitutional\u0097 but that this did not necessarily entitle the petitioners to a full refund. We explained that the Constitution required Virginia to \"`provide relief consistent with federal due process principles,'\" 509 U.S., at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (citing <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 181, 110 S.Ct. 2323), but that \"`a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination'\" under the due process clause, 509 U.S., at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (citing <i>McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112444\"><a href=\"/opinion/112444/mckesson-corp-v-division-of-alcoholic-beverages-an/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 39-40, 110 S.Ct. 2238, 110 L.Ed.2d 17 (1990)). We left to the \"Virginia courts this question of state law and the performance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any appropriate remedy.\" 509 U.S., at 102, 113 S.Ct. 2510. And we specifically noted that Virginia \"`is free to choose which form of relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal requirements we have outlined.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>McKesson,</i> 496 U.S., at 51-52, 110 S.Ct. 2238); see also 509 U.S., at 102, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (\"State law may provide relief beyond the demands of federal due process, but under no circumstances may it confine petitioners to a lesser remedy\" citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Thus, to the extent that these civil retroactivity decisions are relevant to the issue before us today,<sup>[23]</sup> they support our conclusion that the remedy a state court chooses to provide its citizens for violations of the Federal Constitution is primarily a question of state law. Federal law simply \"sets certain minimum requirements that States must meet but may exceed in providing appropriate relief.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 178-179, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (plurality opinion). They provide no support for the proposition that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1046</span> federal law places a limit on state authority to provide remedies for federal constitutional violations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p>Finally, while the State acknowledges that it may grant its citizens broader protection than the Federal Constitution requires by enacting appropriate legislation or by judicial interpretation of its own Constitution, it argues that it may not do so by judicial misconstruction of federal law. <i>Oregon v. Hass,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109221\"><a href=\"/opinion/109221/oregon-v-hass/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span>, 95 S.Ct. 1215, 43 L.Ed.2d 570 (1975)\u0097like our early decisions in <i>Ableman v. Booth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87245\"><a href=\"/opinion/87245/ableman-v-booth/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 16 L.Ed. 169 (1859), and <i>Tarble's Case,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></span>, 20 L.Ed. 597 (1872)\u0097provides solid support for that proposition. But the States that give broader retroactive effect to this Court's new rules of criminal procedure do not do so by misconstruing the federal <i>Teague</i> standard. Rather, they have developed <i>state</i> law to govern retroactivity in state postconviction proceedings. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>State v. Whitfield,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></span>, 268 (Mo.2003) (\"[A]s a matter of state law, this Court chooses not to adopt the <i>Teague</i> analysis ...\"). The issue in this case is whether there is a federal rule, either implicitly announced in <i>Teague,</i> or in some other source of federal law, that prohibits them from doing so.</p>\n<p>The absence of any precedent for the claim that <i>Teague</i> limits state collateral review courts' authority to provide remedies for federal constitutional violations is a sufficient reason for concluding that there is no such rule of federal law. That conclusion is confirmed by several additional considerations. First, if there is such a federal rule of law, presumably the Supremacy Clause in Article V of the Federal Constitution would require all state entities\u0097not just state judges\u0097to comply with it. We have held that States can waive a <i>Teague</i> defense, during the course of litigation, by expressly choosing not to rely on it, see <i>Collins v. Youngblood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112471\"><a href=\"/opinion/112471/collins-v-youngblood/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 41, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990), or by failing to raise it in a timely manner, see <i>Schiro v. Farley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112922\"><a href=\"/opinion/112922/schiro-v-farley/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, 228-229, 114 S.Ct. 783, 127 L.Ed.2d 47 (1994). It would indeed be anomalous to hold that state legislatures and executives are not bound by <i>Teague,</i> but that state courts are.</p>\n<p>Second, the State has not identified, and we cannot discern, the source of our authority to promulgate such a novel rule of federal law. While we have ample authority to control the administration of justice in the federal courts\u0097particularly in their enforcement of federal legislation\u0097we have no comparable supervisory authority over the work of state judges. <i>Johnson v. Fankell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118124\"><a href=\"/opinion/118124/johnson-v-fankell/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span>, 117 S.Ct. 1800, 138 L.Ed.2d 108 (1997). And while there are federal interests that occasionally justify this Court's development of common-law rules of federal law,<sup>[24]</sup> our normal role is to interpret law created by others and \"not to prescribe what it shall be.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Just as constitutional doubt may tip the scales in favor of one construction of a statute rather than another, so does uncertainty about <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1047</span> the source of authority to impose a federal limit on the power of state judges to remedy wrongful state convictions outweigh any possible policy arguments favoring the rule that respondent espouses.</p>\n<p>Finally, the dissent contends that the \"end result [of this opinion] is startling\" because \"two criminal defendants, each of whom committed the same crime, at the same time, whose convictions became final on the same day, and each of whom raised an identical claim at the same time under the Federal Constitution\" could obtain different results. <i>Post,</i> at 1047. This assertion ignores the fact that the two hypothetical criminal defendants did not actually commit the \"same crime.\" They violated different state laws, were tried in and by different state sovereigns, and may\u0097for many reasons\u0097be subject to different penalties. As previously noted, such nonuniformity is a necessary consequence of a federalist system of government.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII</h2>\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that our jurisprudence concerning the \"retroactivity\" of \"new rules\" of constitutional law is primarily concerned, not with the question whether a constitutional violation occurred, but with the availability or nonavailability of remedies. The former is a \"pure question of federal law, our resolution of which should be applied uniformly throughout the Nation, while the latter is a mixed question of state and federal law.\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> 496 U.S., at 205, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>A decision by this Court that a new rule does not apply retroactively under <i>Teague</i> does not imply that there was no right and thus no violation of that right at the time of trial\u0097only that no remedy will be provided in federal habeas courts. It is fully consistent with a government of laws to recognize that the finality of a judgment may bar relief. It would be quite wrong to assume, however, that the question whether constitutional violations occurred in trials conducted before a certain date depends on how much time was required to complete the appellate process.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. As was true in <i>Michigan v. Payne</i><i>,</i> the Minnesota Court is free to reinstate its judgment disposing of the petition for state postconviction relief.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Chief Justice ROBERTS, with whom Justice KENNEDY joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Some of our new rulings on the meaning of the United States Constitution apply retroactively\u0097to cases already concluded\u0097and some do not. This Court has held that the question whether a particular ruling is retroactive is itself a question of federal law. It is basic that when it comes to any such question of federal law, it is \"the province and duty\" of this Court \"to say what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). State courts are the final arbiters of their own state law; this Court is the final arbiter of federal law. State courts are therefore bound by our rulings on whether our cases construing federal law are retroactive.</p>\n<p>The majority contravenes these bedrock propositions. The end result is startling: Of two criminal defendants, each of whom committed the same crime, at the same time, whose convictions became final on the same day, and each of whom raised an identical claim at the same time under the Federal Constitution, one may be executed while the other is set free\u0097the first despite <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1048</span> being correct on his claim, and the second because of it. That result is contrary to the Supremacy Clause and the Framers' decision to vest in \"one supreme Court\" the responsibility and authority to ensure the uniformity of federal law. Because the Constitution requires us to be more jealous of that responsibility and authority, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>One year after <i>Teague v.

When questions of state law are at issue, state courts generally have the authority to determine the retroactivity of their own decisions. The retroactive applicability of a constitutional decision of this Court, however, `is every bit as much of a federal question as what particular federal constitutional provisions themselves mean, what they guarantee, and whether they have been denied.'\" <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.

Payne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108794\"><a href=\"/opinion/108794/michigan-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1966, 36 L.Ed.2d 736 (1973), and <i>Arsenault v.

Even more recently, we held that the \"Supremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law.\" <i>Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112890\"><a href=\"/opinion/112890/harper-v-virginia-dept-of-taxation/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Indeed, about the only point on which our retroactivity jurisprudence has been consistent is that the retroactivity of new federal rules is a question of federal law binding on States. The Court's contrary holding is based on a misreading of our precedent and a misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity generally.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>As the Court correctly points out, before 1965 we took for granted the proposition that all federal constitutional rights, including rights that represented a break from earlier precedent, would be given full retroactive effect on both direct and collateral review. That all changed with <i>Linkletter v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107084\"><a href=\"/opinion/107084/linkletter-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span>, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). In that case, a Louisiana prisoner brought a federal habeas petition arguing that illegally seized evidence was introduced against him at trial in violation of <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106285\"><a href=\"/opinion/106285/mapp-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span>, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). <i>Mapp,</i> however, had been decided after his conviction became final. We granted certiorari to decide whether the <i>Mapp</i> rule \"operates retrospectively upon cases finally decided in the period prior to <i>Mapp.</i>\" 381 U.S., at 619-620, 85 S.Ct. 1731. In answering this question, we broke from our past practice of assuming full retroactivity, holding that \"we are neither required to apply, nor prohibited from applying, a decision retrospectively.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731. Our analysis turned entirely on the nature and scope of the particular constitutional right at issue: \"[W]e must ... weigh the merits and demerits [of retroactive application] in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1049</span> and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Under this framework, we held that <i>Mapp</i> would apply only prospectively. 381 U.S., at 639-640, 85 S.Ct. 1731.</p>\n<p>The next year, we decided <i>Johnson v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107260\"><a href=\"/opinion/107260/johnson-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). <i>Johnson</i> was a direct appeal from the New Jersey Supreme Court's denial of <i>state</i> collateral relief. The precise question in <i>Johnson</i> was whether the rules announced in <i>Escobedo v. Illinois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106883\"><a href=\"/opinion/106883/escobedo-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), and <i>Miranda v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), would apply to state prisoners whose convictions had become final before those cases were decided. In holding that <i>Escobedo</i> and <i>Miranda</i> should apply only prospectively, 384 U.S., at 732, 86 S.Ct. 1772, we imported <i>Linkletter</i>'s mode of retroactivity analysis into review of state postconviction proceedings, 384 U.S., at 726-727, 86 S.Ct. 1772. Finally, in <i>Stovall v. Denno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107488\"><a href=\"/opinion/107488/stovall-v-denno/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), we announced that, for purposes of retroactivity analysis, \"no distinction is justified between convictions now final, as in the instant case, and convictions at various stages of trial and direct review.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 300, 87 S.Ct. 1967.</p>\n<p>Thus, by 1967, the <i>Linkletter</i> analysis was applied in review of criminal convictions, whether final or not. No matter at what stage of proceedings this Court considered a retroactivity question, the issue was decided with reference to the purposes and practical impact of the precise federal right in question: \"Each constitutional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own background of precedent, and its own impact on the administration of justice, and the way in which these factors combine [to decide the retroactivity issue] must inevitably vary with the [constitutional] dictate involved.\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 728, 86 S.Ct. 1772.</p>\n<p>Because the question of retroactivity was so tied up with the nature and purpose of the underlying federal constitutional right, it would have been surprising if any of our cases had suggested that States were free to apply new rules of federal constitutional law retroactively even when we would not. As one of the more thoughtful legal scholars put it in discussing the effect of the <i>Linkletter</i> analysis on state collateral review, \"[i]f a state gave relief in such a case on the exclusive authority of <i>Mapp,</i> under the rationale of the <i>Linkletter</i> opinion it would presumably have been reversed.\" Mishkin, Foreword: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L.Rev. 56, 91, n. 132 (1965).</p>\n<p>Our precedents made clear that States could give greater substantive protection under their own laws than was available under federal law, and could give whatever retroactive effect to <i>those</i> laws they wished. As the Court explained in <i>Johnson,</i> \"[o]f course, States are still entirely free to effectuate under their own law stricter standards than those we have laid down and to apply those standards in a broader range of cases than is required by this decision.\" 384 U.S., at 733, 86 S.Ct. 1772. The clear implication of this statement was that States could apply their own retroactivity rules only to new substantive rights \"under their own law,\" not to new federal rules announced by this Court.</p>\n<p>Thus, contrary to the Court's view, our early retroactivity cases nowhere suggested that the retroactivity of new federal constitutional rules of criminal procedure was anything other than \"a matter of federal law.\" <i>Daniel v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109181\"><a href=\"/opinion/109181/daniel-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 32, 95 S.Ct. 704, 42 L.Ed.2d 790 (1975) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> It is no surprise, then, that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1050</span> when we held that a particular right would not apply retroactively, the language in our opinions did not indicate that our decisions were optional. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Fuller v. Alaska,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107788\"><a href=\"/opinion/107788/fuller-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 81, 89 S.Ct. 61, 21 L.Ed.2d 212 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i> (the rule announced in <i>Lee v.

In considering this question, the state court noted that this Court had \"not yet decided whether <i>Pearce</i> is to be applied retroactively.\" <i>People v. Payne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1710932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1710932/people-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 90, n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1710932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1710932/people-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 378, n. 2 (1971). Nevertheless, without so much as citing any federal retroactivity precedent, the court decided that it would \"apply <i>Pearce</i> in the present case in order to instruct our trial courts as to the Michigan interpretation of an ambiguous portion of <i>Pearce</i> ..., pending clarification by the United States Supreme Court.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 91, n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1710932\"><a href=\"/opinion/1710932/people-v-payne/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 191 N.W.2d, at 378, n. 2.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in <i>Payne</i> only on the question of retroactivity, and decided that <i>Pearce</i> should not apply retroactively. In reversing the contrary decision of the state court, our language was not equivocal: \"Since the resentencing hearing in this case took place approximately two years before <i>Pearce</i> was decided, we hold that the Michigan Supreme Court erred in applying its proscriptions here.\" 412 U.S., at 57, 93 S.Ct. 1966.</p>\n<p>The majority argues that <i>Payne</i> did not preclude States from applying retroactivity rules different from those we announced; rather, the argument goes, the Michigan Supreme Court simply elected to follow the federal retroactivity rule, \"pending clarification.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 1042-1044. That is certainly a possible reading of <i>Payne,</i> but not the most plausible one. The Michigan Supreme Court did not purport to rest its decision to apply <i>Pearce</i> retroactively on the federal <i>Linkletter</i> analysis, and this Court's reversal is most reasonably read as <i>requiring</i> state courts to apply our federal retroactivity decisions. Notably, this is not the first time Members of this Court have debated the meaning of <i>Payne,</i> with <i>Teague</i>'s author explaining that <i>Payne</i> supports the proposition that \"we have consistently required that state courts adhere to our retroactivity decisions,\" <i>American Trucking,</i> 496 U.S., at 178, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.), and the author of today's opinion disagreeing in dissent, see <i>id.,</i> at 210, n. 4, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But whichever way <i>Payne</i> is read, it either offers no support for the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1051</span> majority's position, because the state court simply applied federal retroactivity rules, or flatly rejects the majority's position, because the state court failed to apply federal retroactivity rules, and was told by this Court that it must.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Justice Harlan had begun dissenting in our retroactivity cases, pressing the view that new rules announced by the Court should be applied in all cases not yet final, without regard to the analysis set forth in <i>Linkletter.</i> See <i>Desist v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107875\"><a href=\"/opinion/107875/desist-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 256-269, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969); <i>Mackey v.

In <i>Griffith v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111785\"><a href=\"/opinion/111785/griffith-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987), we abandoned <i>Linkletter</i> as it applied to cases still on direct review and adopted Justice Harlan's view in such cases. Noting that nonretroactivity on direct appeal \"violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication\" and that \"selective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated defendants the same,\" 479 U.S., at 322, 323, 107 S.Ct. 708, we held that \"a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, <i>state or federal,</i> pending on direct review or not yet final,\" <i>id.,</i> at 328, 107 S.Ct. 708 (emphasis added). Just as in previous cases, <i>Griffith</i> by its terms bound state courts to apply our retroactivity decisions.</p>\n<p>Two years after <i>Griffith</i> was decided, we granted certiorari in <i>Yates v. Aiken,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111976\"><a href=\"/opinion/111976/yates-v-aiken/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 108 S.Ct. 534, 98 L.Ed.2d 546 (1988). In that case, a South Carolina state habeas court had decided that our decision in <i>Francis v. Franklin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111418\"><a href=\"/opinion/111418/francis-v-franklin/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span>, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985), should not be applied retroactively. If the authority of state courts to apply their own retroactivity rules were well established under our precedents\u0097as the majority would have it, see <i>ante,</i> at 1035-1039\u0097 this case should have been easily decided on the ground that whatever the federal retroactivity rule, the State could adopt its own rule on the retroactivity of newly announced federal constitutional standards.</p>\n<p>Instead, the State argued to this Court \"that we should adopt Justice Harlan's theory that a newly announced constitutional rule should not be applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review unless\" the rule meets certain criteria\u0097 the flip side of Justice Harlan's view about cases on direct review that we had accepted in <i>Griffith.</i> 484 U.S., at 215, 108 S.Ct. 534. Under that approach, the State argued, <i>Francis</i> would not be applied retroactively on collateral review. 484 U.S., at 215, 108 S.Ct. 534. In response, we discussed Justice Harlan's \"distinction between direct review and collateral review.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We found, however, that it was \"not necessary to determine whether we should... adopt Justice Harlan's reasoning as to the retroactivity of cases announcing new constitutional rules to cases pending on collateral review,\" <i>id.,</i> at 215-216, 108 S.Ct. 534, because <i>Francis</i> did not announce a new rule.</p>\n<p>This Court went on, however, to address South Carolina's alternative argument\u0097 that it \"has the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings,\" which would allow it in the case before the Court \"to refuse to apply a new rule of federal constitutional law retroactively in such a proceeding.\" 484 U.S., at 217, 108 S.Ct. 534. This argument should sound familiar\u0097whatever the federal retroactivity rule, a State may establish its own retroactivity rule for its own collateral proceedings. This Court rejected that proposition, not only because it did not regard <i>Francis</i> as a new rule, but also because the state court did not \"plac[e] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1052</span> any limit on the issues that it will entertain in collateral proceedings.\" 484 U.S., at 218, 108 S.Ct. 534. As this Court explained, if the state court \"consider[s] the merits of the federal claim, it has a duty to grant the relief that <i>federal law</i> requires.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Given all this, the present case should come out the way it does only if <i>Teague</i> changed the nature of retroactivity as a creature of federal law binding on the States, and adopted the argument rejected in <i>Yates</i>\u0097that when it comes to retroactivity, a State \"has the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings.\" <i>Teague</i> did no such thing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>In <i>Teague,</i> we completed the project of conforming our view on the retroactivity of new rules of criminal procedure to those of Justice Harlan. Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion posed the problem by noting, with more than a bit of understatement, that the \"<i>Linkletter</i> retroactivity standard has not led to consistent results.\" 489 U.S., at 302, 109 S.Ct. 1060. In light of these concerns, and because of \"`the important distinction between direct review and collateral review,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 307, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (quoting <i>Yates, supra,</i> at 215, 108 S.Ct. 534), we generally adopted Justice Harlan's approach to retroactivity on collateral review, 489 U.S., at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, just as we had previously adopted his approach on direct review in <i>Griffith.</i></p>\n<p>The <i>Linkletter</i> approach to retroactivity was thus overruled in favor of the Harlan approach in two steps: <i>Griffith</i> and <i>Teague.</i> There is no dispute that <i>Griffith</i> is fully binding on States; a new rule \"is to be applied retroactively to all cases, <i>state or federal,</i> pending on direct review or not yet final.\" 479 U.S., at 328, 107 S.Ct. 708 (emphasis added). <i>Teague</i> is simply the other side of the coin, and it too should be binding in \"all cases, state or federal.\" The fact that <i>Linkletter</i> was overruled in two stages rather than one should not lead to a different result.</p>\n<p>Indeed, <i>Teague</i> did not purport to distinguish between federal and state collateral review. Justice O'Connor's opinion noted that \"in <i>Yates v. Aiken</i><i>,</i> we were asked to decide whether the rule announced in <i>Francis v. Franklin</i><i>,</i> should be applied to a defendant on collateral review at the time that case was decided,\" but that we were able to decide the case on alternative grounds. 489 U.S., at 307, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (citations omitted). This citation of <i>Yates</i>\u0097a state habeas case\u0097makes clear that <i>Teague</i> contemplated no difference between retroactivity of new federal rules in state and federal collateral proceedings. Thus, our unqualified holding\u0097 that \"[u]nless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced,\" 489 U.S., at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060\u0097is enough to decide this case.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the reasons the <i>Teague</i> Court provided for adopting Justice Harlan's view apply to state as well as federal collateral review. The majority is quite right that <i>Teague</i> invoked the interest in comity between the state and federal sovereigns. <i>Id.,</i> at 308, 109 S.Ct. 1060. But contrary to the impression conveyed by the majority, there was more to <i>Teague</i> than that. <i>Teague</i> also relied on the interest in finality: \"Application of constitutional rules not in existence at the time a conviction became final seriously undermines the principle of finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system. Without finality, the criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 309, 109 S.Ct. 1060. The Court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1053</span> responds by flatly stating that \"finality of state convictions is a <i>state</i> interest, not a federal one.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1040-1041. But while it is certainly true that finality of state convictions is a state interest, that does mean it is not also a federal one. After all, our decision in <i>Griffith</i> made finality the touchstone for retroactivity of new federal rules, and bound States to that judgment. See 479 U.S., at 328, 107 S.Ct. 708 (new rules are \"to be applied retroactively to all cases, <i>state or federal,</i> pending on direct review or not yet final\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>It is quite a radical proposition to assert that this Court has nothing to say about an interest \"essential to the operation of our criminal justice system,\" without which \"the criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect,\" when the question is whether this interest is being undermined by the very rules of <i>federal</i> constitutional procedure that we are charged with expounding. A State alone may \"evaluate, and weigh the importance of\" finality interests, <i>ante,</i> at 1040-1041, when it decides which substantive rules of criminal procedure <i>state law</i> affords; it is quite a leap to hold, as the Court does, that they alone can do so in the name of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p><i>Teague</i> was also based on the inequity of the <i>Linkletter</i> approach to retroactivity. After noting that the disparate treatment of similarly situated defendants led us in <i>Griffith</i> to adopt Justice Harlan's view for cases on direct appeal, the Court then explained that the \"<i>Linkletter</i> standard also led to unfortunate disparity in the treatment of similarly situated defendants on collateral review.\" 489 U.S., at 305, 109 S.Ct. 1060. See also <i>id.,</i> at 316, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (the Court's new approach to retroactivity \"avoids the inequity resulting from the uneven application of new rules to similarly situated defendants\").</p>\n<p>This interest in reducing the inequity of haphazard retroactivity standards and disuniformity in the application of federal law is quite plainly a predominantly federal interest. Indeed, it was one of the main reasons we cited in <i>Griffith</i> for imposing a uniform rule of retroactivity upon <i>state</i> courts for cases on direct appeal. And, more to the point, it is the very interest that animates the Supremacy Clause and our role as the \"one supreme Court\" charged with enforcing it.</p>\n<p>Justice Story, writing for the Court, noted nearly two centuries ago that the Constitution requires \"<i>uniformity</i> of decisions throughout the whole United States, upon all subjects within [its] purview.\" <i>Martin v. Hunter's Lessee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85160\"><a href=\"/opinion/85160/martin-v-hunters-lessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 347-348, 4 L.Ed. 97 (1816). Indeed, the \"fundamental principle\" of our Constitution, as Justice O'Connor once put it, is \"that a single sovereign's law should be applied equally to all.\" Our Judicial Federalism, 35 Case W. Res. L.Rev. 1, 4 (1985). States are free to announce their own state-law rules of criminal procedure, and to apply them retroactively in whatever manner they like. That is fully consistent with the principle that \"a single sovereign's law should be applied equally to all.\" But the Court's opinion invites just the sort of disuniformity in federal law that the Supremacy Clause was meant to prevent. The same determination of a federal constitutional violation at the same stage in the criminal process can result in freedom in one State and loss of liberty or life in a neighboring State.<sup>[2]</sup> The Court's opinion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1054</span> allows \"a single sovereign's law\"\u0097the Federal Constitution, as interpreted by this Court\u0097to be applied differently in every one of the several States.</p>\n<p>Finally, from <i>Linkletter</i> through <i>Johnson</i> to <i>Teague,</i> we have always emphasized that determining whether a new federal right is retroactive turns on the nature of the substantive federal rule at issue. See <i>Linkletter,</i> 381 U.S., at 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731 (in deciding retroactivity, we \"loo[k] to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation\"); <i>Johnson,</i> 384 U.S., at 728, 86 S.Ct. 1772 (\"Each constitutional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own background of precedent, and its own impact on the administration of justice, and the way in which these factors combine [to decide the retroactivity issue] must inevitably vary with the dictate involved\"); <i>Teague, supra,</i> at 311-315, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (deciding whether rule is applicable to cases on collateral review turns on whether the rule \"places `certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,'\" and whether the rule is an \"absolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness that is `implicit in the concept of ordered liberty'\"). That is how we determine retroactivity \u0097by carefully examining the underlying federal right. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Whorton v. Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1181-1184, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007); <i>Schriro v.

The nature and scope of the new rules we announce directly determines whether they will be applied retroactively on collateral review. Today's opinion stands for the unfounded proposition that while we alone have the final say in expounding the former, we have no control over the latter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Court's holding is not only based on a misreading of our retroactivity cases, but also on a misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity generally. The majority's decision is grounded on the erroneous view that retroactivity is a remedial question. See <i>ante,</i> at 1046-1047 (\"It is important to keep in mind that our jurisprudence concerning the `retroactivity' of `new rules' of constitutional law is primarily concerned, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1055</span> not with the question whether a constitutional violation occurred, but with the availability or nonavailability of remedies\"). But as explained in the lead opinion in <i>American Trucking</i>\u0097penned by the author of the lead opinion in <i>Teague</i>\u0097it is an \"error\" to \"equat[e] a decision not to apply a rule retroactively with the judicial choice of a remedy.\" 496 U.S., at 194, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.). As Justice O'Connor went on to emphasize, \"[n]or do this Court's retroactivity decisions, whether in the civil or criminal sphere, support the ... assertion that our retroactivity doctrine is a remedial principle.\" <i>Ibid.</i> \"While application of the principles of retroactivity may have remedial effects, they are not themselves remedial principles .... A decision defining the operative conduct or events that will be adjudicated under old law does not, in itself, specify an appropriate remedy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 195, 110 S.Ct. 2323. See also <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108757\"><a href=\"/opinion/108757/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 199, 93 S.Ct. 1463, 36 L.Ed.2d 151 (1973) (plurality opinion) (describing the question of retroactivity as \"whether we will apply a new constitutional rule of criminal law in reviewing judgments of conviction obtained under a prior standard,\" and contrasting this with the question of the \"appropriate scope of federal equitable remedies\").</p>\n<p>In other words, when we ask whether and to what extent a rule will be retroactively applied, we are asking what law\u0097 new or old\u0097will apply. As we have expressly noted, \"[t]he <i>Teague</i> doctrine ... does not involve a special `remedial' limitation on the principle of `retroactivity' as much as it reflects a limitation inherent in the principle itself.\" <i>Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117933\"><a href=\"/opinion/117933/reynoldsville-casket-co-v-hyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 758, 115 S.Ct. 1745, 131 L.Ed.2d 820 (1995).</p>\n<p>The foregoing prompts a lengthy rejoinder from the Court, to the effect that it is wrong to view retroactivity as a federal choice-of-law question rather than a remedial one. That view, we are told, was rejected by five Justices in <i>American Trucking</i> and then by the Court in <i>Harper. Ante,</i> at 1043-1046. But the proposition on which five Members of the Court agreed in <i>American Trucking,</i> and that the Court adopted in <i>Harper,</i> was that the <i>Griffith</i> rule of retroactivity\u0097that is, that newly announced constitutional decisions should apply to all cases on direct review\u0097should apply to civil cases as well as criminal. See <i>American Trucking,</i> 496 U.S., at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\"I share Justice STEVENS' perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role, which is to say what the law is, not to prescribe what it shall be\"); <i>id.,</i> at 212, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"Fundamental notions of fairness and legal process dictate that the same rules should be applied to all similar cases on direct review\"); <i>Harper,</i> 509 U.S., at 97, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (\"When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review\").</p>\n<p>Neither Justice SCALIA's concurrence in <i>American Trucking</i> combined with the dissent, nor the Court's opinion in <i>Harper,</i> resolved that retroactivity was a remedial question. That is why, the year after <i>American Trucking</i> was decided, two of the Justices in today's majority could explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Since the question is whether the court should apply the old rule or the new one, retroactivity is properly seen in the first instance as a matter of choice of law, `a choice ... between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward.' <i>Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co.,</i> 287 U.S. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1056</span> 358, 364, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360 (1932). Once a rule is found to apply `backward,' there may then be a further issue of remedies, <i>i.e.,</i> whether the party prevailing under a new rule should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the rule had been an old one. Subject to possible constitutional thresholds, the remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where the case originates in state court. See <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112450\"><a href=\"/opinion/112450/american-trucking-assns-inc-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 210, 110 S.Ct. 2323, 110 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). <i>But the antecedent choice-of-law question is a federal one where the rule at issue itself derives from federal law, constitutional or otherwise.</i> See <i>Smith, supra,</i> at 177-178[, 110 S.Ct. 2323] (plurality opinion).\" <i>James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112634\"><a href=\"/opinion/112634/james-b-beam-distilling-co-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 534-535, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991) (opinion of SOUTER, J., joined by STEVENS, J.) (citation omitted; emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>And <i>Harper</i> certainly did not view the retroactivity of federal rules as a remedial question for state courts. Quite the contrary: <i>Harper</i> held that the \"Supremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law,\" 509 U.S., at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (citation omitted), and expressly treated retroactivity and remedy as separate questions, <i>id.,</i> at 100-102, 113 S.Ct. 2510.</p>\n<p>The majority explains that when we announce a new rule of law, we are not \"`<i>creating</i> the law,'\" but rather \"`<i>declaring</i> what the law already is.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1044 (quoting <i>American Trucking, supra,</i> at 201, 110 S.Ct. 2323 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment)). But this has nothing to do with the question before us. The point may lead to the conclusion that nonretroactivity of our decisions is improper\u0097 the position the Court has adopted in both criminal and civil cases on direct review\u0097 but everyone agrees that full retroactivity is not required on collateral review. It necessarily follows that we must choose whether \"new\" or \"old\" law applies to a particular category of cases. Suppose, for example, that a defendant, whose conviction became final before we announced our decision in <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), argues (correctly) on collateral review that he was convicted in violation of both <i>Crawford</i> and <i>Ohio v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110324\"><a href=\"/opinion/110324/ohio-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), the case that <i>Crawford</i> overruled. Under our decision in <i>Whorton v. Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007), the \"new\" rule announced in <i>Crawford</i> would not apply retroactively to the defendant. But I take it to be uncontroversial that the defendant would nevertheless get the benefit of the \"old\" rule of <i>Roberts,</i> even under the view that the rule not only is but always has been an incorrect reading of the Constitution. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Yates,</i> 484 U.S., at 218, 108 S.Ct. 534. Thus, the question whether a particular federal rule will apply retroactively is, in a very real way, a choice between new and old law. The issue in this case is who should decide.</p>\n<p>The proposition that the question of retroactivity\u0097that is, the choice between new or old law in a particular case\u0097is distinct from the question of remedies has several important implications for this case. To begin with, whatever intuitive appeal may lie in the majority's statement that \"the remedy a state court chooses to provide its citizens for violations of the Federal Constitution is primarily a question of state law,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1045, the statement misses the mark. The relevant inquiry is not about remedy; it is about choice of law\u0097 new or old. There is no reason to believe, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1057</span> either legally or intuitively, that States should have any authority over this question when it comes to which <i>federal</i> constitutional rules of criminal procedure to apply.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Indeed, when the question is what federal rule of decision from this Court should apply to a particular case, no Court but this one\u0097which has the ultimate authority \"to say what the law is,\" <i>Marbury,</i> 1 Cranch, at 177, 2 L.Ed. 60\u0097should have final say over the answer. See <i>Harper, supra,</i> at 100, 113 S.Ct. 2510 (\"Supremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law\" (citation omitted)). This is enough to rebut the proposition that there is no \"source of [our] authority\" to bind state courts to follow our retroactivity decisions. <i>Ante,</i> at 1046-1047. Retroactivity is a question of federal law, and our final authority to construe it cannot, at this point in the Nation's history, be reasonably doubted.</p>\n<p>Principles of federalism protect the prerogative of States to extend greater rights under their own laws than are available under federal law. The question here, however, is the availability of protection under the Federal Constitution\u0097specifically, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. It is no intrusion on the prerogatives of the States to recognize that it is for this Court to decide such a question of federal law, and that our decision is binding on the States under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p>Consider the flip side of the question before us today: If a State interprets its own constitution to provide protection beyond that available under the Federal Constitution, and has ruled that this interpretation is not retroactive, no one would suppose that a federal court could hold otherwise, and grant relief under state law that a state court would refuse to grant. The result should be the same when a state court is asked to give retroactive effect to a right under the Federal Constitution that this Court has held is not retroactive.</p>\n<p>The distinction between retroactivity and available remedies highlights the fact that the majority's assertion \"that <i>Teague</i>'s general rule of nonretroactivity was an exercise of this Court's power to interpret the federal habeas statute,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1039-1040\u0097even if correct\u0097is neither here nor there.<sup>[4]</sup> While Congress has substantial control over federal courts' ability to grant relief for violations of the Federal Constitution, the Constitution gives us the responsibility to decide what its provisions mean. And with that responsibility necessarily comes the authority to determine the scope of those provisions\u0097when they apply and when they do not.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1058</span> This proposition\u0097and the importance of the distinction between retroactivity and available remedies\u0097were confirmed when we considered the availability of federal collateral review of state convictions under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Whatever control Congress has over federal courts' ability to grant postconviction remedies, the availability or scope of those remedies has no bearing on our decisions about whether new or old law should apply in a particular case. That is why, after AEDPA's passage, we view the <i>Teague</i> inquiry as distinct from that under AEDPA. See <i>Horn v. Banks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121156\"><a href=\"/opinion/121156/horn-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 272, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002) <i>(per curiam)</i> (\"While it is of course a necessary prerequisite to federal habeas relief that a prisoner satisfy the AEDPA standard of review set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), ... none of our post-AEDPA cases have suggested that a writ of habeas corpus should automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies the AEDPA standard, or that AEDPA relieves courts from the responsibility of addressing properly raised <i>Teague</i> arguments\"). The majority today views the issue as simply one of what remedies a State chooses to apply; our cases confirm that the question whether a federal decision is retroactive is one of federal law distinct from the issue of available remedies.</p>\n<p>Lurking behind today's decision is of course the question of just how free state courts are to define the retroactivity of our decisions interpreting the Federal Constitution. I do not see any basis in the majority's logic for concluding that States are free to hold our decisions retroactive when we have held they are not, but not free to hold that they are not when we have held they are. Under the majority's reasoning, in either case the availability of relief in state court is a question for those courts to evaluate independently. The majority carefully reserves that question, see <i>ante,</i> at 1034, n. 4, confirming that the majority regards it as open.</p>\n<p>Nor is there anything in today's decision suggesting that States could not adopt more nuanced approaches to retroactivity. For example, suppose we hold that the Sixth Amendment right to be represented by particular counsel of choice, recently announced in <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145633\"><a href=\"/opinion/145633/united-states-v-gonzalez-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006), is a new rule that does not apply retroactively. Under the majority's rationale, a state court could decide that it nonetheless will apply <i>Gonzalez-Lopez</i> retroactively, but only if the defendant could prove prejudice, or some other criterion we had rejected as irrelevant in defining the substantive right. Under the majority's logic, that would not be a misapplication of our decision in <i>Gonzalez-Lopez</i>\u0097which specifically rejected any required showing of prejudice, <i>id.,</i> at 147-148, 126 S.Ct. 2557\u0097but simply a state decision on the scope of available remedies in state court. The possible permutations\u0097from State to State, and federal right to federal right\u0097are endless.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Perhaps all this will be dismissed as fine parsing of somewhat arcane precedents, over which reasonable judges may disagree. Fair enough; but I would hope that enough has been said at least to refute the majority's assertion that its conclusion is dictated by our prior cases. This dissent is compelled not simply by disagreement over how to read those cases, but by the fundamental issues at stake\u0097our role under the Constitution as the final arbiter of federal law, both as to its meaning and its reach, and the accompanying duty to ensure the uniformity of that federal law.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1059</span> Stephen Danforth's conviction became final before the new rule in <i>Crawford</i> was announced. In <i>Whorton v. Bockting,</i> 549 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007), we held that <i>Crawford</i> shall not be applied retroactively on collateral review. That should be the end of the matter. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although <i>Teague</i> was a plurality opinion that drew support from only four Members of the Court, the <i>Teague</i> rule was affirmed and applied by a majority of the Court shortly thereafter.

We noted in <i>Linkletter</i> that <i>Mapp</i> was being applied to cases that were still pending on direct review at the time it was decided, so the issue before us was expressly limited to \"whether the exclusionary principle enunciated in <i>Mapp</i> applies to state court convictions which had become final before rendition of our opinion.\" 381 U.S., at 622, 85 S.Ct. 1731 (footnote omitted). Shortly thereafter, however, we held that the three-pronged <i>Linkletter</i> analysis should be applied both to convictions that were final before rendition of our opinions and to cases that were still pending on direct review.

L.Rev. 56, 91, n. 132 (1965)). Notably, this comment was made in the context of an attack on <i>Linkletter</i>'s prospective approach as inconsistent with the idea that judges are \"bound by a body of fixed, overriding law.\" Mishkin, 79 Harv. L.Rev., at 62. Moreover, the footnote cited by the dissent concludes with a statement that \"the reservation to the states of the power to apply [new rules] to all convictions, ... is ... the preferable pattern.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 91, n. 132, 85 S.Ct. 1731. In all events, even if <i>Linkletter</i> and its progeny rested on the assumption that \"new rules\" of constitutional law did not exist until announced by this Court, that view of the law was rejected when we endorsed Justice Harlan's analysis of retroactivity.</p>\n<p>[13]  That same year, we similarly denied retroactive effect to the rule announced in <i>Griffin v.

Shortly thereafter, in a case involving a <i>Griffin</i> error, we held for the first time that there are some constitutional errors that do not require the automatic reversal of a conviction. <i>Chapman v.

Both <i>Shott</i> and <i>Chapman</i> protected the State of California from a potentially massive exodus of state prisoners because their prosecutors and judges had routinely commented on a defendant's failure to testify.</p>\n<p>[14]  Although the plain meaning of this language in <i>Johnson</i> is that a state creating its own substantive standards can be as generous with their retroactive effect as it wishes, courts and commentators both before and after <i>Teague v.

Much of the reasoning applicable to applications for writs of habeas corpus filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 seems equally applicable in the context of \u00a7 2255 motions. See <i>United States v.

As far as we can tell, only three States\u0097Minnesota, Oregon, and Montana\u0097have adopted a contrary view. See <i>Page,</i> 336 Ore. 379, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835870\"><a href=\"/opinion/835870/page-v-palmateer/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>; <i>Egelhoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"883627\"><a href=\"/opinion/883627/state-v-egelhoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"883627\"><a href=\"/opinion/883627/state-v-egelhoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>[18]  In <i>Pearce,</i> we held:\n</p>\n<p>\"[W]henever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear.

While Justice Harlan would probably disagree with the suggestion that the distinction between civil and criminal cases provided an acceptable basis for refusing to follow <i>Griffith</i> in the <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v.

It is not free to follow its own federal rule simply because the issue arises in federal court. By the same token, a state court considering a federal constitutional claim on collateral review should follow the federal rule on whether new or old law applies. It is not free to follow its own state-law view on the question simply because the issue arises in state court.</p>\n<p>[4]  The majority's assertion, however, is a bit of an overstatement. <i>Teague</i> would be an odd form of statutory interpretation; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 is cited once in passing, 489 U.S., at 298, 109 S.Ct. 1060, and \u00a7 2243\u0097the statute that the Court believes <i>Teague</i> was interpreting\u0097is not cited at all. As support for its proposition, the Court cites several cases having nothing to do with retroactivity, and numerous concurring and dissenting opinions that did not command a majority. See <i>ante,</i> at 1040-1041, and n. 15.</p>\n\n</div>",
