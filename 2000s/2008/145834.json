Section 2680(c) provides that the waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to claims arising from the detention of property by \"any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\" Petitioner contends that this clause applies only to law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws, and thus does not affect the waiver of sovereign immunity for his property claim against officers of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). We conclude that the broad phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" covers all law enforcement officers. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the dismissal of petitioner's claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Abdus-Shahid M.S. Ali was a federal prisoner at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2001 to 2003. In December 2003, petitioner was scheduled to be transferred to the United States Penitentiary Big Sandy (USP Big Sandy) in Inez, Kentucky. Before being transferred, he left two duffle bags containing his personal property in the Atlanta prison's Receiving and Discharge Unit to be inventoried, packaged, and shipped to USP Big Sandy. Petitioner was transferred, and his bags arrived some days later. Upon inspecting his property, he noticed that several items were missing. The staff at USP Big Sandy's Receiving and Discharge Unit told him that he had been given everything that was sent, and that if things were missing he could file a claim. Many of the purportedly missing items were of religious and nostalgic significance, including two copies of the Qur'an, a prayer rug, and religious magazines. Petitioner estimated that the items were worth $177.</p>\n<p>Petitioner filed an administrative tort claim. In denying relief, the agency noted that, by his signature on the receipt form, petitioner had certified the accuracy of the inventory listed thereon and had thereby relinquished any future claims relating to missing or damaged property. Petitioner then filed a complaint alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> violations of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 <i>et seq.</i> The BOP maintained that petitioner's claim was barred by the exception in \u00a7 2680(c) for property claims against law enforcement officers. The District Court agreed and dismissed petitioner's FTCA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Court's interpretation of \u00a7 2680(c). 204 Fed.Appx. 778, 779-780 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> In rejecting petitioner's arguments, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court's broad interpretation of \u00a7 2680(c)'s \"detention\" clause in <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> 465 U.S. 848, 854-859, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), on decisions by other Courts of Appeals, and on its own decision in <i>Schlaebitz v. United States Dept. of Justice,</i> 924 F.2d 193, 195 (1991) <i>(per curiam)</i> (holding that United States Marshals, who were allegedly negligent in releasing a parolee's luggage to a third party, were \"law enforcement officers\" under \u00a7 2680(c)). See 204 Fed. Appx., at 779-780.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2875, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007), to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to the scope of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*835</span> \u00a7 2680(c).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In the FTCA, Congress waived the United States' sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal employees. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). As relevant here, the FTCA authorizes \"claims against the United States, for money damages ... for injury or loss of property ... caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The FTCA exempts from this waiver certain categories of claims. See \u00a7\u00a7 2680(a)-(n). Relevant here is the exception in subsection (c), which provides that \u00a7 1346(b) shall not apply to \"[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\" \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p>This case turns on whether the BOP officers who allegedly lost petitioner's property qualify as \"other law enforcement officer[s]\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2680(c).<sup>[2]</sup> Petitioner argues that they do not because \"any other law enforcement officer\" includes only law enforcement officers acting in a customs or excise capacity. Noting that Congress referenced customs and excise activities in both the language at issue and the preceding clause in \u00a7 2680(c), petitioner argues that the entire subsection is focused on preserving the United States' sovereign immunity only as to officers enforcing those laws.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's argument is inconsistent with the statute's language.<sup>[3]</sup> The phrase \"<i>any</i> other law enforcement officer\" suggests a broad meaning. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). We have previously noted that \"[r]ead naturally, the word `any' has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*836</span> an expansive meaning, that is, `one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.'\" <i>United States v. Gonzales,</i> 520 U.S. 1, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)). In <i>Gonzales,</i> we considered a provision that imposed an additional sentence for firearms used in federal drug trafficking crimes and provided that such additional sentence shall not be concurrent with \"any other term of imprisonment.\" 520 U.S., at 4, 117 S.Ct. 1032 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (emphasis deleted)). Notwithstanding the subsection's initial reference to federal drug trafficking crimes, we held that the expansive word \"any\" and the absence of restrictive language left \"no basis in the text for limiting\" the phrase \"any other term of imprisonment\" to federal sentences. 520 U.S., at 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032. Similarly, in <i>Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc.,</i> 446 U.S. 578, 100 S.Ct. 1889, 64 L.Ed.2d 525 (1980), the Court considered the phrase \"any other final action\" in amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Court explained that the amendments expanded a list of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator actions by adding two categories of actions: actions under a specifically enumerated statutory provision, and \"any other final action\" under the Clean Air Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 584, 100 S.Ct. 1889 (emphasis deleted). Focusing on Congress' choice of the word \"any,\" the Court \"discern[ed] no uncertainty in the meaning of the phrase, `any other final action,'\" and emphasized that the statute's \"expansive language offer[ed] no indication whatever that Congress intended\" to limit the phrase to final actions similar to those in the specifically enumerated sections. <i>Id.,</i> at 588-589, 100 S.Ct. 1889.</p>\n<p>We think the reasoning of <i>Gonzales</i> and <i>Harrison</i> applies equally to the expansive language Congress employed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). Congress' use of \"any\" to modify \"other law enforcement officer\" is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind.<sup>[4]</sup> The word \"any\" is repeated four times in the relevant portion of \u00a7 2680(c), and two of those instances appear in the particular phrase at issue: \"<i>any</i> officer of customs or excise or <i>any</i> other law enforcement officer.\" (Emphasis added.) Congress inserted the word \"any\" immediately before \"other law enforcement officer,\" leaving no doubt that it modifies that phrase. To be sure, the text's references to \"tax or customs duty\" and \"officer[s] of customs or excise\" indicate that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from an officer's enforcement of tax and customs laws. The text also indicates, however, that Congress intended to preserve immunity for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*837</span> claims arising from the detention of property, and there is no indication that Congress intended immunity for those claims to turn on the type of law being enforced.</p>\n<p>Petitioner would require Congress to clarify its intent to cover all law enforcement officers by adding phrases such as \"performing any official law enforcement function,\" or \"without limitation.\" But Congress could not have chosen a more all-encompassing phrase than \"any other law enforcement officer\" to express that intent. We have no reason to demand that Congress write less economically and more repetitiously.</p>\n<p>Recent amendments to \u00a7 2680(c) support the conclusion that \"any other law enforcement officer\" is not limited to officers acting in a customs or excise capacity. In the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, Congress added subsections (c)(1)(c)(4) to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680. \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. As amended, \u00a7 2680(c) provides that the \u00a7 1346(b) waiver of sovereign immunity, notwithstanding the exception at issue in this case, applies to:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A]ny claim based on injury or loss of goods, merchandise, or other property, while in the possession of any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer, if\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) the interest of the claimant was not forfeited;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) the interest of the claimant was not remitted or mitigated (if the property was subject to forfeiture); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) the claimant was not convicted of a crime for which the interest of the claimant in the property was subject to forfeiture under a Federal criminal forfeiture law.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The amendment does not govern petitioner's claim because his property was not \"seized for the purpose of forfeiture,\" as required by paragraph (1). Nonetheless, the amendment is relevant because our construction of \"any other law enforcement officer\" must, to the extent possible, ensure that the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent. See <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (citing <i>United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises,</i> 489 U.S. 235, 240, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989)). The amendment canceled the exception\u0097and thus restored the waiver of sovereign immunity\u0097for certain seizures of property based on <i>any</i> federal forfeiture law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c)(1) (excepting property claims if \"the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under <i>any provision of Federal law</i> providing for the forfeiture of property\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Under petitioner's interpretation, only law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws were immune under the prior version of \u00a7 2680(c). Thus, on petitioner's reading, the amendment's only effect was to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws. This strikes us as an implausible interpretation of the statute. If that were Congress' intent, it is not apparent why Congress would have restored the waiver with respect to the enforcement of <i>all</i> civil forfeiture laws instead of simply those related to customs or excise. Petitioner's interpretation makes sense only if we assume that Congress went out of its way to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise. But petitioner fails to demonstrate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*838</span> that customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, ever enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise, much less that they do so with such frequency that Congress is likely to have singled them out in the amendment.<sup>[5]</sup> It seems far more likely that Congress restored the waiver for officers enforcing <i>any</i> civil forfeiture law because, in its view, <i>all</i> such officers were covered by the exception to the waiver prior to the amendment.</p>\n<p>Against this textual and structural evidence that \"any other law enforcement officer\" does in fact mean any other law enforcement officer, petitioner invokes numerous canons of statutory construction. He relies primarily on <i>ejusdem generis,</i> or the principle that \"when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.\" <i>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers,</i> 499 U.S. 117, 129, 111 S.Ct. 1156, 113 L.Ed.2d 95 (1991). In petitioner's view, \"any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\" should be read as a three-item list, and the final, catchall phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" should be limited to officers of the same nature as the preceding specific phrases.</p>\n<p>Petitioner likens his case to two recent cases in which we found the canon useful. In <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,</i> 537 U.S. 371, 375, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003), we considered the clause \"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\" in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a). Applying <i>ejusdem generis,</i> we concluded that \"other legal process\" was limited to legal processes of the same nature as the specific items listed. 537 U.S., at 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017. The department's scheme for serving as a representative payee of the benefits due to children under its care, while a \"legal process,\" did not share the common attribute of the listed items, viz., \"utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism ... by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge\" a debt. 537 U.S., at 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017. Similarly, in <i>Dolan v. Postal Service,</i> 546 U.S. 481, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*839</span> L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006), the Court considered whether an exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising out of the \"`loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter'\" barred a claim that mail negligently left on the petitioner's porch caused her to slip and fall. <i>Id.,</i> at 485, 126 S.Ct. 1252 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b)). Noting that \"loss\" and \"miscarriage\" both addressed \"failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address,\" 546 U.S., at 487, 126 S.Ct. 1252, the Court concluded that \"negligent transmission\" must be similarly limited, <i>id.,</i> at 486-489, 126 S.Ct. 1252, and rejected the Government's argument that the exception applied to \"all torts committed in the course of mail delivery,\" <i>id.,</i> at 490, 126 S.Ct. 1252.</p>\n<p>Petitioner asserts that \u00a7 2680(c), like the clauses at issue in <i>Keffeler</i> and <i>Dolan,</i> \"`presents a textbook <i>ejusdem generis</i> scenario.'\" Brief for Petitioner 15 (quoting <i>Andrews v. United States,</i> 441 F.3d 220, 224 (C.A.4 2006)). We disagree. The structure of the phrase \"any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\" does not lend itself to application of the canon. The phrase is disjunctive, with one specific and one general category, not\u0097like the clauses at issue in <i>Keffeler</i> and <i>Dolan</i>\u0097a list of specific items separated by commas and followed by a general or collective term. The absence of a list of specific items undercuts the inference embodied in <i>ejusdem generis</i> that Congress remained focused on the common attribute when it used the catchall phrase. Cf. <i>United States v. Aguilar,</i> 515 U.S. 593, 615, 115 S.Ct. 2357, 132 L.Ed.2d 520 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting the canon's applicability to an omnibus clause that was \"one of ... several distinct and independent prohibitions\" rather than \"a general or collective term following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory command is applicable\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is not apparent what common attribute connects the specific items in \u00a7 2680(c). Were we to use the canon to limit the meaning of \"any other law enforcement officer,\" we would be required to determine the relevant limiting characteristic of \"officer of customs or excise.\" In <i>Jarecki v. G.D. Searle Co.,</i> 367 U.S. 303, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961), for example, the Court invoked <i>noscitur a sociis</i> in limiting the scope of the term \"`discovery'\" to the common characteristic it shared with \"`exploration'\" and \"`prospecting.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579. The Court noted that all three words in conjunction \"describe[d] income-producing activity in the oil and gas and mining industries.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Here, by contrast, no relevant common attribute immediately appears from the phrase \"officer of customs or excise.\" Petitioner suggests that the common attribute is that both types of officers are charged with enforcing the customs and excise laws. But we see no reason why that should be the relevant characteristic as opposed to, for example, that officers of that type are commonly involved in the activities enumerated in the statute: the assessment and collection of taxes and customs duties and the detention of property.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's appeals to other interpretive principles are also unconvincing. Petitioner contends that his reading is supported by the canon <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> according to which \"a word is known by the company it keeps.\" <i>S.D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection,</i> 547 U.S. 370, 378, 126 S.Ct. 1843, 164 L.Ed.2d 625 (2006). But the cases petitioner cites in support of applying <i>noscitur a sociis</i> involved statutes with stronger contextual cues. See <i>Gutierrez v. Ada,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*840</span> 528 U.S. 250, 254-258, 120 S.Ct. 740, 145 L.Ed.2d 747 (2000) (applying the canon to narrow the relevant phrase, \"any election,\" where it was closely surrounded by six specific references to gubernatorial elections); <i>Jarecki, supra,</i> at 306-309, 81 S.Ct. 1579 (applying the canon to narrow the term \"discoveries\" to discoveries of mineral resources where it was contained in a list of three words, all of which applied to the oil, gas, and mining industries and could not conceivably all apply to any other industry). Here, although customs and excise are mentioned twice in \u00a7 2680(c), nothing in the overall statutory context suggests that customs and excise officers were the exclusive focus of the provision. The emphasis in subsection (c) on customs and excise is not inconsistent with the conclusion that \"any other law enforcement officer\" sweeps as broadly as its language suggests.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the rule against superfluities lends petitioner sparse support. The construction we adopt today does not necessarily render \"any officer of customs or excise\" superfluous; Congress may have simply intended to remove any doubt that officers of customs or excise were included in \"law enforcement officers.\" See <i>Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA,</i> 495 U.S. 641, 646, 110 S.Ct. 2043, 109 L.Ed.2d 659 (1990) (noting that \"technically unnecessary\" examples may have been \"inserted out of an abundance of caution\"). Moreover, petitioner's construction threatens to render \"any other law enforcement officer\" superfluous because it is not clear when, if ever, \"other law enforcement officer[s]\" act in a customs or excise capacity.<sup>[6]</sup> In any event, we do not woodenly apply limiting principles every time Congress includes a specific example along with a general phrase. See <i>Harrison,</i> 446 U.S., at 589, n. 6, 100 S.Ct. 1889 (rejecting an argument that <i>ejusdem generis</i> must apply when a broad interpretation of the clause could render the specific enumerations unnecessary).</p>\n<p>In the end, we are unpersuaded by petitioner's attempt to create ambiguity where the statute's text and structure suggest none. Had Congress intended to limit \u00a7 2680(c)'s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written \"any other law enforcement officer <i>acting in a customs or excise capacity.</i>\" Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing phrase \"any other law enforcement officer.\" Nothing in the statutory context requires a narrowing construction\u0097indeed, as we have explained, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*841</span> the statute is most consistent and coherent when \"any other law enforcement officer\" is read to mean what it literally says. See <i>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co.,</i> 499 U.S., at 129, 111 S.Ct. 1156 (noting that interpretive canons must yield \"when the whole context dictates a different conclusion\"). It bears emphasis, moreover, that \u00a7 2680(c), far from maintaining sovereign immunity for the entire universe of claims against law enforcement officers, does so only for claims \"arising in respect of\" the \"detention\" of property. We are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable.<sup>[7]</sup> Instead, we must give effect to the text Congress enacted: Section 2680(c) forecloses lawsuits against the United States for the unlawful detention of property by \"any,\" not just \"some,\" law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice SOUTER, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Statutory interpretation, from beginning to end, requires respect for the text. The respect is not enhanced, however, by decisions that foreclose consideration of the text within the whole context of the statute as a guide to determining a legislature's intent. To prevent textual analysis from becoming so rarefied that it departs from how a legislator most likely understood the words when he or she voted for the law, courts use certain interpretative rules to consider text within the statutory design. These canons do not demand wooden reliance and are not by themselves dispositive, but they do function as helpful guides in construing ambiguous statutory provisions. Two of these accepted rules are <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which together instruct that words in a series should be interpreted in relation to one another.</p>\n<p>Today the Court holds, if my understanding of its opinion is correct, that there is only one possible way to read the statute. Placing implicit reliance upon a comma at the beginning of a clause, the Court says that the two maxims noted, and indeed other helpful and recognized principles of statutory analysis, are not useful as interpretative aids in this case because the clause cannot be understood by what went before. In my respectful submission the Court's approach is incorrect as a general rule and as applied to the statute now before us. Both the analytic framework and the specific interpretation the Court now employs become binding on the federal courts, which will confront other cases in which a series of words operate in a clause similar to the one we consider today. So this case is troubling not only for the result the Court reaches but also for the analysis it employs. My disagreements with the Court lead to this dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows those who allege injury from governmental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*842</span> actions over a vast sphere to seek damages for tortious conduct. The enacting Congress enumerated 13 exceptions to the Act's broad waiver of sovereign immunity, all of which shield the Government from suit in specific instances. These exceptions must be given careful consideration in order to prevent interference with the governmental operations described. As noted in <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> 465 U.S. 848, 853, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), however, \"unduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute.\"</p>\n<p>As the Court states, at issue here is the extent of the exception for suits arising from the detention of goods in defined circumstances. The relevant provision excepts from the general waiver</p>\n<blockquote>\"claim[s] arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c).</blockquote>\n<p>Both on first reading and upon further, close consideration, the plain words of the statute indicate that the exception is concerned only with customs and taxes. The provision begins with a clause dealing exclusively with customs and tax duties. And the provision as a whole contains four express references to customs and tax, making revenue duties and customs and excise officers its most salient features. Cf. <i>Gutierrez v. Ada,</i> 528 U.S. 250, 254-255, 120 S.Ct. 740, 145 L.Ed.2d 747 (2000).</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that the Court's reading is wholly impermissible or without some grammatical support. After all, detention of goods is not stated until the outset of the second clause and at the end of the same clause the words \"any other law enforcement officer\" appear; so it can be argued that the first and second clauses of the provision are so separate that all detentions by all law enforcement officers in whatever capacity they might act are covered. Still, this ought not be the preferred reading; for between the beginning of the second clause and its closing reference to \"any other law enforcement officer\" appears another reference to \"officer[s] of customs or excise,\" this time in the context of property detention. This is quite sufficient, in my view, to continue the limited scope of the exception. At the very least, the Court errs by adopting a rule which simply bars all consideration of the canons of <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis.</i> And when those canons are consulted, together with other common principles of interpretation, the case for limiting the exception to customs and tax more than overcomes the position maintained by the Government and adopted by the Court.</p>\n<p>The <i>ejusdem generis</i> canon provides that, where a seemingly broad clause constitutes a residual phrase, it must be controlled by, and defined with reference to, the \"enumerated categories ... which are recited just before it,\" so that the clause encompasses only objects similar in nature. <i>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,</i> 532 U.S. 105, 115, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001). The words \"any other law enforcement officer\" immediately follow the statute's reference to \"officer[s] of customs or excise,\" as well as the first clause's reference to the assessment of tax and customs duties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p>The Court counters that \u00a7 2680(c) \"is disjunctive, with one specific and one general category,\" rendering <i>ejusdem generis</i> inapplicable. <i>Ante,</i> at 839. The canon's applicability, however, is not limited to those statutes that include a laundry list of items. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers,</i> 499 U.S. 117, 129, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*843</span> 111 S.Ct. 1156, 113 L.Ed.2d 95 (1991) (\"[W]hen a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration\"). In addition, <i>ejusdem generis</i> is often invoked in conjunction with the interpretative canon <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which provides that words are to be \"`known by their companions.'\" <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,</i> 537 U.S. 371, 384, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003) (quoting <i>Gutierrez, supra,</i> at 255, 120 S.Ct. 740). The general rule is that the \"meaning of a word, and, consequently, the intention of the legislature,\" should be \"ascertained by reference to the context, and by considering whether the word in question and the surrounding words are, in fact, <i>ejusdem generis,</i> and referable to the same subject-matter.\" <i>Neal v. Clark,</i> 95 U.S. 704, 709, 24 L.Ed. 586 (1878) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>A proper reading of \u00a7 2680(c) thus attributes to the last phrase (\"any other law enforcement officer\") the discrete characteristic shared by the preceding phrases (\"officer[s] of customs or excise\" and \"assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty\"). See also <i>Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance,</i> 542 U.S. 55, 62-63, 124 S.Ct. 2373, 159 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004) (applying <i>ejusdem generis</i> to conclude that \"`failure to act'\" means \"failure to take an <i>agency action</i>\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs., supra,</i> at 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017 (holding that the phrase \"other legal process\" in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) refers only to the utilization of a judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, the common attribute shared by the phrase and the statutory enumeration preceding it). Had Congress intended otherwise, in all likelihood it would have drafted the section to apply to \"any law enforcement officer, including officers of customs and excise,\" rather than tacking \"any other law enforcement officer\" on the end of the enumerated categories as it did here.</p>\n<p>The common attribute of officers of customs and excise and other law enforcement officers is the performance of functions most often assigned to revenue officers, including, <i>inter alia,</i> the enforcement of the United States' revenue laws and the conduct of border searches. Although officers of customs and officers of excise are in most instances the only full-time staff charged with this duty, officers of other federal agencies and general law enforcement officers often will be called upon to act in the traditional capacity of a revenue officer. For example, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents frequently assist customs officials in the execution of border searches. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gurr,</i> 471 F.3d 144, 147-149 (C.A.D.C.2006) (FBI involved in search of financial documents at border); <i>United States v. Boumelhem,</i> 339 F.3d 414, 424 (C.A.6 2003) (\"FBI had been cooperating with Customs as a part of a joint task force\"); <i>Formula One Motors, Ltd. v. United States,</i> 777 F.2d 822, 824 (C.A.2 1985) (DEA agents were performing functions traditionally carried out by Customs officials where they seized and searched an automobile that had been shipped from abroad and was still in its shipping container). Cf. <i>United States v. Schoor,</i> 597 F.2d 1303, 1305-1306 (C.A.9 1979) (upholding constitutionality of cooperation amongst federal agencies in border searches). Similarly, 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a) grants the Coast Guard plenary authority to stop and board American vessels to inspect for obvious customs violations. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gil-Carmona,</i> 497 F.3d 52 (C.A.1 2007) (Coast Guard assisted an Immigration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*844</span> and Customs Enforcement patrol aircraft in interdicting a vessel off the coast of Puerto Rico). To the extent they detain goods whose possession violates customs laws, the Coast Guard officers\u0097while not \"officer[s] of customs or excise,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c)\u0097are without doubt engaging in the enforcement of the United States' revenue laws.</p>\n<p>The same is true in the tax context. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321, a delinquent taxpayer's property is subject to forfeiture, see <i>Glass City Bank v. United States,</i> 326 U.S. 265, 66 S.Ct. 108, 90 L.Ed. 56 (1945), and may be seized by any federal agent assisting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in executing the forfeiture, cf. <i>United States v. $515,060.42 in United States Currency,</i> 152 F.3d 491, 495 (C.A.6 1998) (IRS and FBI jointly seized currency). Thus, the final phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" has work to do and makes considerable sense when the statute is limited in this way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court reaches its contrary conclusion by concentrating on the word \"any\" before the phrase \"other law enforcement officer.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). It takes this single last phrase to extend the statute so that it covers all detentions of property by any law enforcement officer in whatever capacity he or she acts. There are fundamental problems with this approach, in addition to the ones already mentioned.</p>\n<p>First, the Court's analysis cannot be squared with the longstanding recognition that a single word must not be read in isolation but instead defined by reference to its statutory context. See <i>King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,</i> 502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991) (\"[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context\"); <i>Dolan v. Postal Service,</i> 546 U.S. 481, 486, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006) (\"A word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities. Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\"). This is true even of facially broad modifiers. The word \"any\" can mean \"different things depending upon the setting,\" <i>Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League,</i> 541 U.S. 125, 132, 124 S.Ct. 1555, 158 L.Ed.2d 291 (2004); see also <i>Small v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 385, 388, 125 S.Ct. 1752, 161 L.Ed.2d 651 (2005) (citing cases), and must be limited in its application \"to those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them,\" <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> 3 Wheat. 610, 631, 4 L.Ed. 471 (1818).</p>\n<p>In <i>Gutierrez,</i> 528 U.S., at 254-255, 120 S.Ct. 740, for example, we held that the phrase \"in any election\" in the Organic Act of Guam, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422, does not refer broadly to all elections but only to the election of Guam's Governor and Lieutenant Governor. The Court explained that the reference to \"any election\" is preceded by two references to gubernatorial elections and followed by four more references. In the context of such \"relentless repetition,\" the Court concluded that the phrase must be \"known by [its] companions.\" 528 U.S., at 255, 120 S.Ct. 740. Likewise, in <i>United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez,</i> 511 U.S. 350, 357, 114 S.Ct. 1599, 128 L.Ed.2d 319 (1994), the Court addressed a phrase similar to the statutory provision we interpret today. The Court noted that the respondent erred in \"placing dispositive weight on the broad statutory reference to `any' law enforcement officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute,\" and consulted instead \"`the context in which [the phrase] is used.'\" <i>Id.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*845</span> at 358, 114 S.Ct. 1599 (quoting <i>Deal v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 129, 132, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993); alteration in original).</p>\n<p>As already mentioned, the context of \u00a7 2680(c) suggests that, in accordance with these precedents, the statutory provision should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to customs and revenue duties. Its first clause deals exclusively with customs and tax duties and, between the first and second clauses, it refers two more times to customs and tax. See <i>Gutierrez, supra,</i> at 254-255, 120 S.Ct. 740; <i>A-Mark, Inc. v. United States Secret Serv. Dept. of Treasury,</i> 593 F.2d 849, 851 (C.A.9 1978) (Tang, J., concurring) (\"The clauses both dwell exclusively on customs and taxes, except for the final reference to other law-enforcement officers\").</p>\n<p>Further, \u00a7 2680(c) provides that there will be immunity only where there has been a \"detention\" of goods, merchandise, or property. \"[D]etention\" is defined by legal and nonlegal dictionaries alike as a \"compulsory,\" \"forced,\" or \"punitive\" containment. Black's Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed.1999) (compulsory); American Heritage Dictionary 494 (4th ed.2000) (forced or punitive). The issue whether petitioner's property was \"detained\" within the meaning of the statute was not raised in this case; and so the Court leaves for another day the exception's applicability to these facts. See <i>ante,</i> at 835, n. 2. It is important, however, to bear in mind that, in the context of detention of goods by customs and tax agents, it will be the rare case when property is voluntarily turned over, rather than forcibly appropriated; indeed, customs and tax agents are in the regular business of seizing and forfeiting property, as are law enforcement agents acting in the capacity of revenue enforcement. See Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mid-Year FY 2007\u0097Top IPR Commodities Seized (May 2007), online at http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/ import/commercial_enforcement/ipr/ seizure/07_midyr_seizures.ctt/07_midyr_ seizures.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 10, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (by midyear 2007, customs officials had executed 7,245 commodity seizures, worth a total of $110,198,350); GAO, Border Security: Despite Progress, Weaknesses in Traveler Inspections Exist at Our Nation's Ports of Entry 17 (GAD-08-219, Nov. 2007), http://www.gao.gov/ new.items/d08219.pdf (\"According to [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] CBP, in fiscal year 2006, CBP officers ... seized more than 644,000 pounds of illegal drugs, intercepted nearly 1.7 million prohibited agricultural items, and seized over $155 million in illegal commercial merchandise, such as counterfeit footwear and handbags\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>In other contexts, however, the word \"detention\" may or may not accurately describe the nature of the Government action. A prisoner's voluntary decision to deliver property for transfer to another facility, for example, bears a greater similarity to a \"bailment\"\u0097the delivery of personal property after being held by the prison in trust, see American Heritage Dictionary, <i>supra,</i> at 134\u0097than to a \"detention.\"</p>\n<p>Not a single federal statute mentions the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the context of property detention. On the other hand, the majority of the nine federal statutes other than \u00a7 2680(c) containing a reference to the detention of goods, merchandise, or other property are specific to customs and excise. Compare 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1499(a) (authorizing customs agents to examine and detain imported merchandise); \u00a7 1595a(c)(3) (authorizing customs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*846</span> officials to detain merchandise introduced contrary to law); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (authorizing internal revenue officers to detain containers containing distilled spirits, wines, or beer where there is reason to believe applicable taxes have not been paid); 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 2411(a)(2)(A) (authorizing customs officials to seize and detain goods at ports of entry in the enforcement of war and national defense); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 464 (authorizing customs agents to detain armed vessels and any property found thereon); with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(e) (\"The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, shall ensure the equitable transfer pursuant to paragraph (2) of any forfeited property to the appropriate State or local law enforcement agency .... The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of the seizure, detention, and transfer of seized property to State or local officials\"); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c)(1) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (appropriating a special fund for the purpose of property detention under any law enforced or administered by the Department of Justice); 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 9703(a)(1)(A) (establishing a Department of Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay the expenses of property detention); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1540(e)(3), 3375(b) (authorizing the detention of goods and packages for inspection where there is reason to believe there has been a violation of laws governing fish, wildlife, and plants).</p>\n<p>This would seem to indicate that Congress contemplated that the statutory provision considered here would apply only in those narrow circumstances where the officer is in the regular business of forfeiting property, namely revenue enforcement. At the very least, it demonstrates that \"detention\" will be a difficult concept to apply case-by-case under the majority's interpretation of the statute\u0097a problem alleviated by limiting the statute to customs and tax.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court's construction of the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" runs contrary to \"`our duty \"to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\"'\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (quoting <i>United States v. Menasche,</i> 348 U.S. 528, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955)). The Court's reading renders \"officer[s] of customs or excise\" mere surplusage, as there would have been no need for Congress to have specified that officers of customs and officers of excise were immune if they indeed were subsumed within the allegedly all-encompassing \"any\" officer clause. See <i>Circuit City Stores,</i> 532 U.S., at 114, 121 S.Ct. 1302.</p>\n<p>Third, though the final reference to \"any other law enforcement officer\" does result in some ambiguity, the legislative history, by virtue of its exclusive reference to customs and excise, confirms that Congress did not shift its attention from the context of revenue enforcement when it used these words at the end of the statute. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S.Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946) (in discussing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) referring only to \"the detention of goods by customs officers\"); A. Holtzoff, Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 16 (1931) (noting that the property-detention exception was added to the legislation to \"include immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise\").</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Court's construction reads the exception to defeat the central purpose of the statute, an interpretative danger the Court has warned against in explicit terms. See <i>Kosak,</i> 465 U.S., at 854, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 1519 (the Court must identify only \"`those circumstances which are within the words <span class=\"star-pagination\">*847</span> and reason of the exception'\u0097no less and no more\") (quoting <i>Dalehite v. United States,</i> 346 U.S. 15, 31, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953)). It is difficult to conceive that the FTCA, which was enacted by Congress to make the tort liability of the United States \"the same as that of a private person under like circumstance[s],\" S.Rep. No. 1400, at 32, would allow any officer under any circumstance to detain property without being accountable under the Act to those injured by his or her tortious conduct. If Congress wanted to say that all law enforcement officers may detain property without liability in tort, including when they perform general law enforcement tasks, it would have done so in more express terms; one would expect at least a reference to law enforcement officers outside the customs or excise context either in the text of the statute or in the legislative history. In the absence of that reference, the Court ought not presume that the liberties of the person who owns the property would be so lightly dismissed and disregarded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The 2000 amendments do not require a contrary conclusion. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA), as applicable here, limits the operation of \u00a7 2680(c)'s exception. See \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. The limitation (<i>i.e.</i> the exception to the exception) applies where there has been an injury or loss of goods and \"the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c)(1). In my view the amendment establishes that officers of customs and excise, and law enforcement officials performing functions traditionally reserved for revenue officers, shall be liable in tort for damage to the property when the owner's interest in the goods in the end is not forfeited (and when other conditions apply). And this is so regardless of whether the officer acted under the revenue laws of the United States or, alternatively, another civil or criminal forfeiture provision.</p>\n<p>The majority's reading of CAFRA for a contrary proposition is premised on the assumption that there is no circumstance in which a customs or excise officer, or a officer acting in such a capacity, would \"enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 838. But customs and tax officials, along with law enforcement officers performing customs and tax duties, routinely do just that. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Customs and Border Protection, Seizures and Penalties Links, http://www.cbp. gov/xp/cgov/ toolbox/legal/authority_enforce/seizures_penalties.xml (CBP has \"full authority to ... seize merchandise for violation of CBP laws or those of other federal agencies that are enforced by CBP\"). Indeed, the customs laws expressly contemplate forfeitures and seizures of property under nonrevenue provisions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1600 (\"The procedures [governing seizures of property] set forth in [\u00a7\u00a7 1602-1619] shall apply to seizures of any property effected by customs officers under any law enforced or administered by the Customs Service unless such law specifies different procedures\").</p>\n<p>By way of example, a customs or excise official might effect a civil forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V); or of counterfeit instruments, illegal music recordings, or firearms under the Contraband Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80302 <i>et seq.</i> Similarly, a DEA agent assisting a customs official in a border search (and thus acting in a customs capacity) might effect a civil forfeiture of vehicles or goods associated with the drug trade under federal drug laws. See 21 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*848</span> U.S.C. \u00a7 881; see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Formula One Motors,</i> 777 F.2d, at 822-823. Though acting pursuant to a civil forfeiture law that is not specific to customs and taxes, the DEA agent would be covered by \u00a7 2680(c)'s exception to the exception because he or she would be acting in a traditional revenue capacity\u0097that of conducting a routine search of persons and effects of persons crossing an international boundary.</p>\n<p>The Court counters that the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c), is not \"unrelated to customs or excise\" because it cross-references a requirement for exporting and importing monetary instruments, \u00a7 5316. See <i>ante,</i> at 838, n. 5. But \u00a7 5316, despite being \"[r]elated\" to customs duties, is part of the federal Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, see \u00a7 5311 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), not the United States' customs laws.</p>\n<p>The Court also notes that customs agents have the authority to seize contraband under the customs laws, particularly 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1595a(c)(1). I do not dispute that customs agents often act under customs laws when seizing property. My point, which goes unrefuted by the Court, is that it was reasonable for Congress to have specified that customs and excise officers would be covered by the exception to the exception even when acting pursuant to federal laws more generally. For instance, \u00a7 1595a(c)(1) applies only where \"[m]erchandise ... is introduced ... into the United States contrary to law,\" which appears to target the importation of property subject to duty or entry restrictions. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), by contrast, was amended in 2000 to encompass not only the detention of \"goods or merchandise\" but the detention of all \"property.\" \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. In circumstances not involving imported \"merchandise,\" then, the customs official would be acting pursuant to law enforcement authority derived not from the customs laws but, <i>inter alia,</i> the Contraband and Bank Secrecy Acts. The same is true of noncustoms officers acting in a customs capacity.</p>\n<p>At the very least this renders the Court's reliance on the views of a subsequent Congress suspect. We have said \"subsequent acts can shape or focus\" the meaning of a statute. <i>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> 529 U.S. 120, 143, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). There is no indication, however, that by adding a forfeiture exception to the exception, Congress intended to broaden the scope of the original immunity. Cf. <i>SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.,</i> 375 U.S. 180, 199-200, 84 S.Ct. 275, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Though the Court does not much rely on the point, perhaps it has concerns respecting suits like the one now before us. Petitioner sues for lost property valued at about $177. Law enforcement officers in the federal prison system must take inventory of the property they store, and with just under 200,000 persons in the federal prison population, see Federal Bureau of Prisons, Weekly Population Report, online at http://www.bop.gov/news/ weekly_report.jsp (reporting 199,342 federal inmates as of January 7, 2008), the burden on the Government to account for missing items of little value could be a substantial one.</p>\n<p>There are sound reasons, though, for rejecting this concern in interpreting the statute. To begin with, as already discussed, if it were a congressional objective to give a comprehensive exception to all officers who detain property, Congress most likely would have written a specific provision to address the point, quite apart from the special concerns it had with customs and revenue. The exception as the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*849</span> Court now interprets it extends not only to trivial detentions, not only to prison officials, not only to those in custody, but to all detentions of property of whatever value held by all law enforcement officials, a reading that simply does not comport with the plain text and context of the statute.</p>\n<p>Second, as the Court observed when interpreting another exception that raised the concern of numerous frivolous claims, liability for negligent transmission \"is a risk shared by any business [involved in management of detention facilities],\" including the Government. <i>Dolan,</i> 546 U.S., at 491, 126 S.Ct. 1252.</p>\n<p>Third, there are already in place administrative procedures that must be exhausted before the suit is allowed, diminishing the number of frivolous suits that would be heard in federal court. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (\"No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\"). Under 28 CFR \u00a7 543.31(a) (2007), the \"owner of the damaged or lost property\" first must file an FTCA claim with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) regional office; the BOP, in turn, is authorized by statute to settle administrative claims for not more than $1,000, see 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723(a), which likely encompasses most claims brought by federal prisoners. Only if the prisoner is \"dissatisfied with the final agency action\" may he or she file suit in an \"appropriate U.S. District Court.\" 28 CFR \u00a7 543.32(g).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>If Congress had intended to give sweeping immunity to all federal law enforcement officials from liability for the detention of property, it would not have dropped this phrase onto the end of the statutory clause so as to appear there as something of an afterthought. The seizure of property by an officer raises serious concerns for the liberty of our people and the Act should not be read to permit appropriation of property without a remedy in tort by language so obscure and indirect.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, in my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice KENNEDY that context makes clear that Congress intended the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" to apply only to officers carrying out customs or excise duties. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). But I write separately to emphasize, as Justice KENNEDY's dissent itself makes clear, that the relevant context extends well beyond Latin canons and other such purely textual devices.</p>\n<p>As with many questions of statutory interpretation, the issue here is not the <i>meaning</i> of the words. The dictionary meaning of each word is well known. Rather, the issue is the statute's <i>scope.</i> What boundaries did Congress intend to set? To what circumstances did Congress intend the phrase, as used in <i>this</i> statutory provision, to apply? The majority answers this question by referring to an amendment that creates an exception for certain forfeitures and by emphasizing the statutory word \"any.\" As to the amendment, I find Justice KENNEDY's counterargument convincing. See <i>ante,</i> at 846-847. And, in my view, the word \"any\" provides no help whatsoever.</p>\n<p>The word \"any\" is of no help because all speakers (including writers and legislators) who use general words such as \"all,\" \"any,\" \"never,\" and \"none\" normally rely upon context to indicate the limits of time <span class=\"star-pagination\">*850</span> and place within which they intend those words to do their linguistic work. And with the possible exception of the assertion of a universal truth, say by a mathematician, scientist, philosopher, or theologian, such limits almost always exist. When I call out to my wife, \"There isn't any butter,\" I do not mean, \"There isn't any butter in town.\" The context makes clear to her that I am talking about the contents of our refrigerator. That is to say, it is context, not a dictionary, that sets the boundaries of time, place, and circumstance within which words such as \"any\" will apply. See <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> 3 Wheat. 610, 631, 4 L.Ed. 471 (1818) (Marshall, C.J.) (\"[G]eneral words,\" such as the word \"`any',\" must \"be limited\" in their application \"to those objects to which the legislature intended to apply them\"); <i>Small v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 385, 388, 125 S.Ct. 1752, 161 L.Ed.2d 651 (2005) (\"The word `any' considered alone cannot answer\" the question \"whether the statutory reference `convicted in <i>any</i> court' includes a conviction entered in a <i>foreign</i> court\"); <i>Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League,</i> 541 U.S. 125, 132, 124 S.Ct. 1555, 158 L.Ed.2d 291 (2004) (\"`[A]ny'\" means \"different things depending upon the setting\"); <i>United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez,</i> 511 U.S. 350, 357, 114 S.Ct. 1599, 128 L.Ed.2d 319 (1994) (\"[R]espondent errs in placing dispositive weight on the broad statutory reference to `any' law enforcement officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute\").</p>\n<p>Context, of course, includes the words immediately surrounding the phrase in question. And canons such as <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis</i> offer help in evaluating the significance of those surrounding words. Yet that help is limited. That is because other contextual features can show that Congress intended a phrase to apply more broadly than the immediately surrounding words by themselves suggest. See <i>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,</i> 532 U.S. 105, 138-140, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001) (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (finding \"good reasons\" not to apply <i>ejusdem generis</i> because the statute's history and purposes make clear that the words \"any other class of workers\" in the phrase \"seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers\" refer, not just to other transportation workers, but to workers of all kinds including retail store clerks). It is because canons of construction are not \"conclusive\" and \"are often countered ... by some maxim pointing in a different direction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 115, 121 S.Ct. 1302 (majority opinion). And it is because these particular canons simply crystallize what English speakers already know, namely, that lists often (but not always) group together items with similar characteristics. (That is why we cannot, without comic effect, yoke radically different nouns to a single verb, <i>e.g.,</i> \"He caught three salmon, two trout, and a cold.\")</p>\n<p>In this case, not only the immediately surrounding words but also every other contextual feature supports Justice KENNEDY's conclusion. The textual context includes the location of the phrase within a provision that otherwise exclusively concerns customs and revenue duties. And the nontextual context includes several features that, taken together, indicate that Congress intended a narrow tort-liability exception related to customs and excise.</p>\n<p>First, drafting history shows that the relevant portion of the bill that became the Federal Tort Claims Act concerned only customs and excise. Initially, the relevant provision of the bill exempted only claims \"arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. 4377, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4 (1930). In 1931, a Special Assistant to the Attorney General, Alexander Holtzoff, wrote additional draft language, namely, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*851</span> \"or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or <i>any other law enforcement officer.</i>\" Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 2 (1931) (emphasis added). Holtzoff, in a report to a congressional agency, said that the expanded language sought \"to include immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 16. Holtzoff explained that the language was suggested by a similar British bill that mentioned only customs and excise officials. <i>Ibid.</i> (referring to the bill proposed in the Crown Proceedings Committee Report \u00a7 11(5)(<i>c</i>), pp. 17-18 (Apr.1927) (Cmd.2842) (\"No proceedings shall lie under this section ... for or in respect of the loss of or any deterioration or damage occasioned to, or any delay in the release of, any goods or merchandise by reason of anything done or omitted to be done by any officer of customs and excise acting as such\")); see <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> 465 U.S. 848, 857, n. 13, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984) (While \"the ideas expressed [in Holtzoff's report] should not be given great weight in determining the intent of the Legislature,\" at least in some circumstances, \"it seems to us senseless to ignore entirely the views of [the provision's] draftsman\"). And Members of Congress repeatedly referred to the exception as encompassing claims involving customs and excise functions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 2428, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 5 (1940); S.Rep. No. 1196, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7 (1942); H.R.Rep. No. 2245, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1942); H.R.Rep. No. 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6 (1945); S.Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 33 (1946).</p>\n<p>Second, insofar as Congress sought, through the Act's exceptions, to preclude tort suits against the Government where \"adequate remedies were already available,\" <i>Kosak, supra,</i> at 858, 104 S.Ct. 1519; see S.Rep. No. 1400, <i>supra,</i> at 33; H.R.Rep. No. 1287, <i>supra,</i> at 6 (setting forth that purpose), a limited exception makes sense; a broad exception does not. Other statutes already provided recovery for plaintiffs harmed by federal officers enforcing customs and tax laws but not for plaintiffs harmed by all other federal officers enforcing most other laws. See <i>Bazuaye v. United States,</i> 83 F.3d 482, 485-486 (C.A.D.C.1996) (detailing history).</p>\n<p>Third, the practical difference between a limited and a broad interpretation is considerable, magnifying the importance of the congressional silence to which Justice KENNEDY points, see <i>ante,</i> at 846-847. A limited interpretation of the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" would likely encompass only those law enforcement officers working, say, at borders and helping to enforce customs and excise laws. The majority instead interprets this provision to include the tens of thousands of officers performing unrelated tasks. The Justice Department estimates that there are more than 100,000 law enforcement officers, not including members of the armed services. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Federal Law Enforcement Officers, 2004, p. 1 (July 2006). And although the law's history contains much that indicates the provision's scope is limited to customs and excise, it contains <i>nothing at all</i> suggesting an intent to apply the provision more broadly, indeed, to multiply the number of officers to whom it applies by what is likely one or more orders of magnitude. It is thus not the Latin canons, <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> that shed light on the application of the statutory phrase but Justice SCALIA's more pertinent and easily remembered English-language observation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*852</span> that Congress \"does not ... hide elephants in mouseholes.\" <i>Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,</i> 531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I dissent and I join Justice KENNEDY's dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Eleventh Circuit joined five other Courts of Appeals in construing \u00a7 2680(c) to encompass all law enforcement officers. See <i>Bramwell v. Bureau of Prisons,</i> 348 F.3d 804, 806-807 (C.A.9 2003); <i>Chapa v. Dept. of Justice,</i> 339 F.3d 388, 390 (C.A.5 2003) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Hatten v. White,</i> 275 F.3d 1208, 1210 (C.A.10 2002); <i>Cheney v. United States,</i> 972 F.2d 247, 248 (C.A.8 1992) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Ysasi v. Rivkind,</i> 856 F.2d 1520, 1525 (C.A.Fed. 1988). Five other Courts of Appeals reached the contrary conclusion, interpreting the clause as limited to officers performing customs or excise functions. See <i>ABC v. DEF,</i> 500 F.3d 103, 107 (C.A.2 2007); <i>Dahler v. United States,</i> 473 F.3d 769, 771-772 (C.A.7 2007) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>; </i><i>Andrews v. United States,</i> 441 F.3d 220, 227 (C.A.4 2006); <i>Bazuaye v. United States,</i> 83 F.3d 482, 486 (C.A.D.C. 1996); <i>Kurinsky v. United States,</i> 33 F.3d 594, 598 (C.A.6 1994).</p>\n<p>[2]  We assume, without deciding, that the BOP officers \"detained\" Ali's property and thus satisfy \u00a7 2680(c)'s \"arising in respect of ... detention\" requirement. The Court of Appeals held that the \"detention\" clause was satisfied, and petitioner expressly declined to raise the issue on certiorari. See 204 Fed. Appx. 778, 779-780 (C.A.11 2006) <i>(per curiam);</i> Brief for Petitioner 10-11, n. 9.</p>\n<p>[3]  We consider this question for the first time in this case. Petitioner argues that this Court concluded in <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> 465 U.S. 848, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), that the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" is ambiguous. Reply Brief for Petitioner 4. In that case, the Court construed a portion of the same clause at issue here, but the decision had no bearing on the meaning of \"any other law enforcement officer.\" 465 U.S., at 853-862, 104 S.Ct. 1519 (holding that \"detention\" encompasses claims resulting from negligent handling or storage). Indeed, the Court expressly declined to reach the issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 852, n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 1519 (\"We have no occasion in this case to decide what kinds of `law-enforcement officer[s],' other than customs officials, are covered by the exception.\" (alteration in original)). Petitioner's reliance on the footnote as concluding that the phrase is ambiguous reads too much into the Court's reservation of a question that was not then before it.</p>\n<p>[4]  Of course, other circumstances may counteract the effect of expansive modifiers. For example, we have construed an \"any\" phrase narrowly when it included a term of art that compelled that result. See <i>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,</i> 532 U.S. 105, 115-116, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001) (construing \"any other class of workers engaged in... commerce,\" 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, narrowly based on the Court's previous interpretation of \"in commerce\" as a term of art with a narrower meaning). We also have construed such phrases narrowly when another term in the provision made sense only under a narrow reading, see <i>United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez,</i> 511 U.S. 350, 357-358, 114 S.Ct. 1599, 128 L.Ed.2d 319 (1994) (limiting \"any law-enforcement officer\" to federal officers because the statute's reference to \"delay\" made sense only with respect to federal officers), and when a broad reading would have implicated sovereignty concerns, see <i>Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</i> 534 U.S. 533, 541-542, 122 S.Ct. 999, 152 L.Ed.2d 27 (2002) (applying the \"clear statement rule\" applicable to waivers of sovereign immunity to construe the phrase \"all civil actions\" to exclude a category of claims, \"even though nothing in the statute expressly exclude[d]\" them). None of the circumstances that motivated our decisions in these cases is present here.</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice KENNEDY'S dissent (hereinafter the dissent) argues that, during border searches, customs and excise officers \"routinely\" enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise. <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But the examples the dissent provides do not support that assertion. The dissent maintains that a customs officer who seizes material defined as contraband under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80302 <i>et seq.,</i> is one such example. <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But a customs officer's authority to effect a forfeiture of such contraband derives from a specific customs law. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1595a(c)(1)(C). Similarly, the dissent suggests that a DEA agent \"assisting a customs official\" in a border search who seizes drug-related contraband under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 is acting in a \"traditional revenue capacity.\" <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But that argument is based on the assumption that an officer who assists in conducting a border search acts in a customs capacity even if he is not a customs officer and is not enforcing a customs law. That assumption, far from self-evident, only underscores the difficulty that would attend any attempt to define the contours of the implied limitation on \u00a7 2680(c)'s reach proposed by petitioner and embraced by the dissent. \"Acting in a customs or excise capacity\" is not a self-defining concept, and not having included such a limitation in the statute's language, Congress of course did not provide a definition. Finally, the dissent points out that a customs or excise officer might effect a forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c). <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But \u00a7 5317(c) is hardly a civil forfeiture law unrelated to customs or excise. See \u00a7 5317(c)(2) (authorizing forfeiture of property involved in a violation of, <i>inter alia,</i> \u00a7 5316, which sets forth reporting requirements for exporting and importing monetary instruments).</p>\n<p>[6]  As an example of \"other law enforcement officer[s]\" acting in an excise or customs capacity, petitioner cites <i>Formula One Motors, Ltd. v. United States,</i> 777 F.2d 822, 823-824 (C.A.2 1985) (holding that the seizure of a vehicle still in transit from overseas by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents who searched it for drugs was \"sufficiently akin to the functions carried out by Customs officials to place the agents' conduct within the scope of section 2680(c)\"). But it is not clear that the agents in that case were acting in an excise or customs capacity rather than in their ordinary capacity as law enforcement agents. It seems to us that DEA agents searching a car for drugs are acting in their capacity as officers charged with enforcing the Nation's drug laws, not the customs or excise laws.\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, the dissent notes that 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a) authorizes Coast Guard officers to enforce customs laws. <i>Post,</i> at 843-844. But the very next subsection of \u00a7 89 provides that Coast Guard officers effectively <i>are</i> customs officers when they enforce customs laws. See \u00a7 89(b)(1) (providing that Coast Guard officers \"insofar as they are engaged, pursuant to the authority contained in this section, in enforcing any law of the United States shall ... be deemed to be acting as agents of the particular executive department ... charged with the administration of the particular law\"). As a result, a Coast Guard officer enforcing a customs law is a customs officer, not some \"other law enforcement officer.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Congress, we note, did provide an administrative remedy for lost property claimants like petitioner. Federal agencies have authority under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723(a)(1) to settle certain \"claim[s] for not more than $1,000 for damage to, or loss of, privately owned property that ... is caused by the negligence of an officer or employee of the United States Government acting within the scope of employment.\" The BOP has settled more than 1,100 such claims in the last three years.

Argued October 29, 2007\u2014Decided January 22, 2008\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the United States\u2019 sover\n  eign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal\n  employees, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b)(1), but, as relevant here, exempts\n  from that waiver \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or\n  collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any . . . prop\n  erty by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement\n  officer,\u201d \u00a72680(c). Upon his transfer from an Atlanta federal prison to\n  one in Kentucky, petitioner noticed that several items were missing\n  from his personal property, which had been shipped to the new facil\n  ity by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Alleging that BOP offi\n  cers had lost his property, petitioner filed this suit under, inter alia,\n  the FTCA, but the District Court dismissed that claim as barred by\n  \u00a72680(c). Affirming, the Eleventh Circuit rejected petitioner\u2019s argu\n  ment that the statutory phrase \u201cany officer of customs or excise or\n  any other law enforcement officer\u201d applies only to officers enforcing\n  customs or excise laws.\nHeld: Section 2680(c)\u2019s text and structure demonstrate that the broad\n phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d covers all law enforcement\n officers. Petitioner\u2019s argument that \u00a72680(c) is focused on preserving\n sovereign immunity only for officers enforcing customs and excise\n laws is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s language. \u201cRead naturally, the\n word \u2018any\u2019 has an expansive meaning, that is, \u2018one or some indis\n criminately of whatever kind.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S.\n 1, 5. For example, in considering a provision imposing an additional\n sentence that was not to run concurrently with \u201cany other term of\n imprisonment,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(1), the Gonzales Court held that,\n notwithstanding the subsection\u2019s initial reference to federal drug\n trafficking crimes, the expansive word \u201cany\u201d and the absence of re\n2               ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    strictive language left \u201cno basis in the text for limiting\u201d the phrase\n    \u201cany other term of imprisonment\u201d to federal sentences. 520 U. S., at\n    5. To similar effect, see Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S.\n    578, 588\u2013589, in which the Court held that there was \u201cno indication\n    whatever that Congress intended\u201d to limit the \u201cexpansive language\u201d\n    \u201c \u2018any other final action\u2019 \u201d to particular kinds of agency action. The\n    reasoning of Gonzales and Harrison applies equally to 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a72680(c): Congress\u2019 use of \u201cany\u201d to modify \u201cother law enforcement of\n    ficer\u201d is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of\n    whatever kind. To be sure, the text\u2019s references to \u201ctax or customs\n    duty\u201d and \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise\u201d indicate an intent to pre\n    serve immunity for claims arising from an officer\u2019s enforcement of tax\n    and customs laws. The text also indicates, however, that Congress\n    intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from the detention\n    of property, and there is no indication of any intent that immunity for\n    those claims turns on the type of law being enforced. Recent amend\n    ments to \u00a72680(c) restoring the sovereign immunity waiver for offi\n    cers enforcing any federal forfeiture law, see \u00a72680(c)(1), support the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion by demonstrating Congress\u2019 view that, prior to the\n    amendments, \u00a72680(c) covered all law enforcement officers. Against\n    this textual and structural evidence, petitioner\u2019s reliance on the can\n    ons of statutory construction ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis\n    and on the rule against superfluities is unconvincing. The Court is\n    unpersuaded by petitioner\u2019s attempt to create ambiguity where the\n    statute\u2019s structure and text suggest none. Had Congress intended to\n    limit \u00a72680(c)\u2019s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have\n    written \u201cany other law enforcement officer acting in a customs or ex\n    cise capacity.\u201d Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing\n    phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer.\u201d This Court must give ef\n    fect to the text Congress enacted.

FEDERAL\n         BUREAU OF PRISONS ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                              [January 22, 2008]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case concerns the scope of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680, which\ncarves out certain exceptions to the United States\u2019 waiver\nof sovereign immunity for torts committed by federal\nemployees. Section 2680(c) provides that the waiver of\nsovereign immunity does not apply to claims arising from\nthe detention of property by \u201cany officer of customs or\nexcise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d Petitioner\ncontends that this clause applies only to law enforcement\nofficers enforcing customs or excise laws, and thus does\nnot affect the waiver of sovereign immunity for his prop\nerty claim against officers of the Federal Bureau of Pris\nons (BOP). We conclude that the broad phrase \u201cany other\nlaw enforcement officer\u201d covers all law enforcement offi\ncers. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals upholding the dismissal of petitioner\u2019s claim.\n                            I\n  Petitioner Abdus-Shahid M. S. Ali was a federal pris\noner at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Geor\ngia, from 2001 to 2003. In December 2003, petitioner was\nscheduled to be transferred to the United States Peniten\n2           ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntiary Big Sandy (USP Big Sandy) in Inez, Kentucky.\nBefore being transferred, he left two duffle bags contain\ning his personal property in the Atlanta prison\u2019s Receiving\nand Discharge Unit to be inventoried, packaged, and\nshipped to USP Big Sandy. Petitioner was transferred,\nand his bags arrived some days later. Upon inspecting his\nproperty, he noticed that several items were missing. The\nstaff at USP Big Sandy\u2019s Receiving and Discharge Unit\ntold him that he had been given everything that was sent,\nand that if things were missing he could file a claim.\nMany of the purportedly missing items were of religious\nand nostalgic significance, including two copies of the\nQur\u2019an, a prayer rug, and religious magazines. Petitioner\nestimated that the items were worth $177.\n   Petitioner filed an administrative tort claim. In denying\nrelief, the agency noted that, by his signature on the re\nceipt form, petitioner had certified the accuracy of the\ninventory listed thereon and had thereby relinquished any\nfuture claims relating to missing or damaged property.\nPetitioner then filed a complaint alleging, inter alia, viola\ntions of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71346, 2671 et seq. The BOP maintained that petitioner\u2019s\nclaim was barred by the exception in \u00a72680(c) for property\nclaims against law enforcement officers. The District\nCourt agreed and dismissed petitioner\u2019s FTCA claim for\nlack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioner appealed.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the Dis\ntrict Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a72680(c). 204 Fed. Appx.\n778, 779\u2013780 (2006) (per curiam). In rejecting petitioner\u2019s\narguments, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court\u2019s\nbroad interpretation of \u00a72680(c)\u2019s \u201cdetention\u201d clause in\nKosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, 854\u2013859 (1984), on\ndecisions by other Courts of Appeals, and on its own deci\nsion in Schlaebitz v. United States Dept. of Justice, 924 F.\n2d 193, 195 (1991) (per curiam) (holding that United\nStates Marshals, who were allegedly negligent in releas\n                    Cite as: 552 U.

See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b)(1). As rele\nvant here, the FTCA authorizes \u201cclaims against the\nUnited States, for money damages . . . for injury or loss of\nproperty . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or\nomission of any employee of the Government while acting\nwithin the scope of his office or employment.\u201d Ibid. The\nFTCA exempts from this waiver certain categories of\nclaims. See \u00a7\u00a72680(a)\u2013(n). Relevant here is the exception\nin subsection (c), which provides that \u00a71346(b) shall not\napply to \u201c[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment\nor collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of\nany goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of\ncustoms or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d\n\u00a72680(c).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Eleventh Circuit joined five other Courts of Appeals in constru\n\ning \u00a72680(c) to encompass all law enforcement officers. See Bramwell\nv. Bureau of Prisons, 348 F. 3d 804, 806\u2013807 (CA9 2003); Chapa v.\nDept. of Justice, 339 F. 3d 388, 390 (CA5 2003) (per curiam); Hatten v.\nWhite, 275 F. 3d 1208, 1210 (CA10 2002); Cheney v. United States, 972\nF. 2d 247, 248 (CA8 1992) (per curiam); Ysasi v. Rivkind, 856 F. 2d\n1520, 1525 (CA Fed. 1988). Five other Courts of Appeals reached the\ncontrary conclusion, interpreting the clause as limited to officers\nperforming customs or excise functions. See ABC v. DEF, 500 F. 3d\n103, 107 (CA2 2007); Dahler v. United States, 473 F. 3d 769, 771\u2013772\n(CA7 2007) (per curiam); Andrews v. United States, 441 F. 3d 220, 227\n(CA4 2006); Bazuaye v.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  This case turns on whether the BOP officers who alleg\nedly lost petitioner\u2019s property qualify as \u201cother law en\nforcement officer[s]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a72680(c).2\nPetitioner argues that they do not because \u201cany other law\nenforcement officer\u201d includes only law enforcement officers\nacting in a customs or excise capacity. Noting that Con\ngress referenced customs and excise activities in both the\nlanguage at issue and the preceding clause in \u00a72680(c),\npetitioner argues that the entire subsection is focused on\npreserving the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity only as\nto officers enforcing those laws.\n  Petitioner\u2019s argument is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s\nlanguage.3 The phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d\nsuggests a broad meaning. Ibid. (emphasis added). We\nhave previously noted that \u201c[r]ead naturally, the word\n\u2018any\u2019 has an expansive meaning, that is, \u2018one or some\nindiscriminately of whatever kind.\u2019 \u201d United States v.\nGonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (quoting Webster\u2019s Third\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We assume, without deciding, that the BOP officers \u201cdetained\u201d Ali\u2019s\n\nproperty and thus satisfy \u00a72680(c)\u2019s \u201carising in respect of . . . detention\u201d\nrequirement. The Court of Appeals held that the \u201cdetention\u201d clause\nwas satisfied, and petitioner expressly declined to raise the issue on\ncertiorari. See 204 Fed. Appx. 778, 779\u2013780 (CA11 2006) (per curiam);\nBrief for Petitioner 10\u201311, n. 9.\n  3 We consider this question for the first time in this case. Petitioner\n\nargues that this Court concluded in Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S.\n848 (1984), that the phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d is\nambiguous. Reply Brief for Petitioner 4. In that case, the Court\nconstrued a portion of the same clause at issue here, but the decision\nhad no bearing on the meaning of \u201cany other law enforcement officer.\u201d\n465 U. S., at 853\u2013862 (holding that \u201cdetention\u201d encompasses claims\nresulting from negligent handling or storage). Indeed, the Court\nexpressly declined to reach the issue. Id., at 852, n. 6 (\u201cWe have no\noccasion in this case to decide what kinds of \u2018law-enforcement officer[s],\u2019\nother than customs officials, are covered by the exception.\u201d (alteration\nin original)). Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the footnote as concluding that the\nphrase is ambiguous reads too much into the Court\u2019s reservation of a\nquestion that was not then before it.\n                    Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nNew International Dictionary 97 (1976)). In Gonzales, we\nconsidered a provision that imposed an additional sen\ntence for firearms used in federal drug trafficking crimes\nand provided that such additional sentence shall not be\nconcurrent with \u201cany other term of imprisonment.\u201d 520\nU. S., at 4 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (em\nphasis deleted)). Notwithstanding the subsection\u2019s initial\nreference to federal drug trafficking crimes, we held that\nthe expansive word \u201cany\u201d and the absence of restrictive\nlanguage left \u201cno basis in the text for limiting\u201d the phrase\n\u201cany other term of imprisonment\u201d to federal sentences.\n520 U. S., at 5. Similarly, in Harrison v. PPG Industries,\nInc., 446 U. S. 578 (1980), the Court considered the phrase\n\u201cany other final action\u201d in amendments to the Clean Air\nAct. The Court explained that the amendments expanded\na list of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator\nactions by adding two categories of actions: actions under\na specifically enumerated statutory provision, and \u201cany\nother final action\u201d under the Clean Air Act. Id., at 584\n(emphasis deleted). Focusing on Congress\u2019 choice of the\nword \u201cany,\u201d the Court \u201cdiscern[ed] no uncertainty in the\nmeaning of the phrase, \u2018any other final action,\u2019 \u201d and em\nphasized that the statute\u2019s \u201cexpansive language offer[ed]\nno indication whatever that Congress intended\u201d to limit\nthe phrase to final actions similar to those in the specifi\ncally enumerated sections. Id., at 588\u2013589.\n  We think the reasoning of Gonzales and Harrison ap\nplies equally to the expansive language Congress em\nployed in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c). Congress\u2019 use of \u201cany\u201d to\nmodify \u201cother law enforcement officer\u201d is most naturally\nread to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Of course, other circumstances may counteract the effect of expan\n\nsive modifiers. For example, we have construed an \u201cany\u201d phrase\nnarrowly when it included a term of art that compelled that result. See\nCircuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115\u2013116 (2001)\n(construing \u201cany other class of workers engaged in . . . commerce,\u201d 9\n6              ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe word \u201cany\u201d is repeated four times in the relevant\nportion of \u00a72680(c), and two of those instances appear in\nthe particular phrase at issue: \u201cany officer of customs or\nexcise or any other law enforcement officer.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) Congress inserted the word \u201cany\u201d immediately\nbefore \u201cother law enforcement officer,\u201d leaving no doubt\nthat it modifies that phrase. To be sure, the text\u2019s refer\nences to \u201ctax or customs duty\u201d and \u201cofficer[s] of customs or\nexcise\u201d indicate that Congress intended to preserve immu\nnity for claims arising from an officer\u2019s enforcement of tax\nand customs laws. The text also indicates, however, that\nCongress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising\nfrom the detention of property, and there is no indication\nthat Congress intended immunity for those claims to turn\non the type of law being enforced.\n  Petitioner would require Congress to clarify its intent to\ncover all law enforcement officers by adding phrases such\nas \u201cperforming any official law enforcement function,\u201d or\n\u201cwithout limitation.\u201d But Congress could not have chosen\na more all-encompassing phrase than \u201cany other law\nenforcement officer\u201d to express that intent. We have no\nreason to demand that Congress write less economically\nand more repetitiously.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nU. S. C. \u00a71, narrowly based on the Court\u2019s previous interpretation of \u201cin\ncommerce\u201d as a term of art with a narrower meaning). We also have\nconstrued such phrases narrowly when another term in the provision\nmade sense only under a narrow reading, see United States v. Alvarez-\nSanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 357\u2013358 (1994) (limiting \u201cany law-enforcement\nofficer\u201d to federal officers because the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cdelay\u201d\nmade sense only with respect to federal officers), and when a broad\nreading would have implicated sovereignty concerns, see Raygor v.\nRegents of Univ. of Minn., 534 U. S. 533, 541\u2013542 (2002) (applying the\n\u201cclear statement rule\u201d applicable to waivers of sovereign immunity to\nconstrue the phrase \u201call civil actions\u201d to exclude a category of claims,\n\u201ceven though nothing in the statute expressly exclude[d]\u201d them). None\nof the circumstances that motivated our decisions in these cases is\npresent here.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Recent amendments to \u00a72680(c) support the conclusion\nthat \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d is not limited to\nofficers acting in a customs or excise capacity. In the Civil\nAsset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, Congress added\nsubsections (c)(1)\u2013(c)(4) to 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680. \u00a73(a), 114\nStat. 211.     As amended, \u00a72680(c) provides that the\n\u00a71346(b) waiver of sovereign immunity, notwithstanding\nthe exception at issue in this case, applies to:\n    \u201c[A]ny claim based on injury or loss of goods, mer\n    chandise, or other property, while in the possession of\n    any officer of customs or excise or any other law en\n    forcement officer, if\u2014\n       \u201c(1) the property was seized for the purpose of for\n    feiture under any provision of Federal law providing\n    for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence\n    imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense;\n       \u201c(2) the interest of the claimant was not forfeited;\n       \u201c(3) the interest of the claimant was not remitted or\n    mitigated (if the property was subject to forfeiture);\n    and\n       \u201c(4) the claimant was not convicted of a crime for\n    which the interest of the claimant in the property was\n    subject to forfeiture under a Federal criminal forfei\n    ture law.\u201d\n  The amendment does not govern petitioner\u2019s claim\nbecause his property was not \u201cseized for the purpose of\nforfeiture,\u201d as required by paragraph (1). Nonetheless, the\namendment is relevant because our construction of \u201cany\nother law enforcement officer\u201d must, to the extent possible,\nensure that the statutory scheme is coherent and consis\ntent. See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 340\n(1997) (citing United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, 489\nU. S. 235, 240 (1989)). The amendment canceled the\nexception\u2014and thus restored the waiver of sovereign\nimmunity\u2014for certain seizures of property based on any\n8              ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal forfeiture law. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c)(1) (except\ning property claims if \u201cthe property was seized for the\npurpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law\nproviding for the forfeiture of property\u201d (emphasis added)).\n  Under petitioner\u2019s interpretation, only law enforcement\nofficers enforcing customs or excise laws were immune\nunder the prior version of \u00a72680(c). Thus, on petitioner\u2019s\nreading, the amendment\u2019s only effect was to restore the\nwaiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or\nofficers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws.\nThis strikes us as an implausible interpretation of the\nstatute. If that were Congress\u2019 intent, it is not apparent\nwhy Congress would have restored the waiver with respect\nto the enforcement of all civil forfeiture laws instead of\nsimply those related to customs or excise. Petitioner\u2019s\ninterpretation makes sense only if we assume that Con\ngress went out of its way to restore the waiver for cases in\nwhich customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such\na capacity, enforce forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or\nexcise. But petitioner fails to demonstrate that customs or\nexcise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, ever\nenforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise,\nmuch less that they do so with such frequency that Con\ngress is likely to have singled them out in the amend\nment.5 It seems far more likely that Congress restored the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 JUSTICE KENNEDY\u2019S dissent (hereinafter the dissent) argues that,\n\nduring border searches, customs and excise officers \u201croutinely\u201d enforce\ncivil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise. Post, at 12\u201313. But\nthe examples the dissent provides do not support that assertion. The\ndissent maintains that a customs officer who seizes material defined as\ncontraband under 49 U. S. C. \u00a780302 et seq., is one such example. Post,\nat 12\u201313. But a customs officer\u2019s authority to effect a forfeiture of such\ncontraband derives from a specific customs law. See 19 U. S. C.\n\u00a71595a(c)(1)(C). Similarly, the dissent suggests that a DEA agent\n\u201cassisting a customs official\u201d in a border search who seizes drug-related\ncontraband under 21 U. S. C. \u00a7881 is acting in a \u201ctraditional revenue\ncapacity.\u201d Post, at 12\u201313. But that argument is based on the assump\n                      Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwaiver for officers enforcing any civil forfeiture law be\ncause, in its view, all such officers were covered by the\nexception to the waiver prior to the amendment.\n   Against this textual and structural evidence that \u201cany\nother law enforcement officer\u201d does in fact mean any other\nlaw enforcement officer, petitioner invokes numerous\ncanons of statutory construction. He relies primarily on\nejusdem generis, or the principle that \u201cwhen a general\nterm follows a specific one, the general term should be\nunderstood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with\nspecific enumeration.\u201d Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. Train\nDispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991). In petitioner\u2019s\nview, \u201cany officer of customs or excise or any other law\nenforcement officer\u201d should be read as a three-item list,\nand the final, catchall phrase \u201cany other law enforcement\nofficer\u201d should be limited to officers of the same nature as\nthe preceding specific phrases.\n   Petitioner likens his case to two recent cases in which\nwe found the canon useful. In Washington State Dept. of\nSocial and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffe\nler, 537 U. S. 371, 375 (2003), we considered the clause\n\u201cexecution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntion that an officer who assists in conducting a border search acts in a\ncustoms capacity even if he is not a customs officer and is not enforcing\na customs law. That assumption, far from self-evident, only under\nscores the difficulty that would attend any attempt to define the con\ntours of the implied limitation on \u00a72680(c)\u2019s reach proposed by peti\ntioner and embraced by the dissent. \u201cActing in a customs or excise\ncapacity\u201d is not a self-defining concept, and not having included such a\nlimitation in the statute\u2019s language, Congress of course did not provide\na definition. Finally, the dissent points out that a customs or excise\nofficer might effect a forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments\nunder 31 U. S. C. \u00a75317(c). Post, at 12\u201313. But \u00a75317(c) is hardly a\ncivil forfeiture law unrelated to customs or excise. See \u00a75317(c)(2)\n(authorizing forfeiture of property involved in a violation of, inter alia,\n\u00a75316, which sets forth reporting requirements for exporting and\nimporting monetary instruments).\n10          ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess\u201d in 42 U. S. C. \u00a7407(a). Applying ejusdem generis,\nwe concluded that \u201cother legal process\u201d was limited to\nlegal processes of the same nature as the specific items\nlisted. 537 U. S., at 384\u2013385. The department\u2019s scheme\nfor serving as a representative payee of the benefits due to\nchildren under its care, while a \u201clegal process,\u201d did not\nshare the common attribute of the listed items, viz., \u201cutili\nzation of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism . . . by\nwhich control over property passes from one person to\nanother in order to discharge\u201d a debt. 537 U. S., at 385.\nSimilarly, in Dolan v. Postal Service, 546 U. S. 481 (2006),\nthe Court considered whether an exception to the FTCA\u2019s\nwaiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising out of the\n\u201c \u2018loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or\npostal matter\u2019 \u201d barred a claim that mail negligently left on\nthe petitioner\u2019s porch caused her to slip and fall. Id., at\n485 (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(b)). Noting that \u201closs\u201d and\n\u201cmiscarriage\u201d both addressed \u201cfailings in the postal obliga\ntion to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right ad\ndress,\u201d 546 U. S., at 487, the Court concluded that \u201cnegli\ngent transmission\u201d must be similarly limited, id., at 486\u2013\n489, and rejected the Government\u2019s argument that the\nexception applied to \u201call torts committed in the course of\nmail delivery,\u201d id., at 490.\n    Petitioner asserts that \u00a72680(c), like the clauses at issue\nin Keffeler and Dolan, \u2018 \u201cpresents a textbook ejusdem\ngeneris scenario.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 15 (quoting An\ndrews v. United States, 441 F. 3d 220, 224 (CA4 2006)).\nWe disagree. The structure of the phrase \u201cany officer of\ncustoms or excise or any other law enforcement officer\u201d\ndoes not lend itself to application of the canon. The phrase\nis disjunctive, with one specific and one general category,\nnot\u2014like the clauses at issue in Keffeler and Dolan\u2014a list\nof specific items separated by commas and followed by a\ngeneral or collective term. The absence of a list of specific\nitems undercuts the inference embodied in ejusdem\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 615 (1995) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting the\ncanon\u2019s applicability to an omnibus clause that was \u201cone of\n. . . several distinct and independent prohibitions\u201d rather\nthan \u201ca general or collective term following a list of spe\ncific items to which a particular statutory command is\napplicable\u201d).\n    Moreover, it is not apparent what common attribute\nconnects the specific items in \u00a72680(c). Were we to use the\ncanon to limit the meaning of \u201cany other law enforcement\nofficer,\u201d we would be required to determine the relevant\nlimiting characteristic of \u201cofficer of customs or excise.\u201d In\nJarecki v. G. D. Searle Co., 367 U. S. 303 (1961), for exam\nple, the Court invoked noscitur a sociis in limiting the\nscope of the term \u201c \u2018discovery\u2019 \u201d to the common characteris\ntic it shared with \u201c \u2018exploration\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018prospecting.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 307. The Court noted that all three words in conjunc\ntion \u201cdescribe[d] income-producing activity in the oil and\ngas and mining industries.\u201d Ibid. Here, by contrast, no\nrelevant common attribute immediately appears from the\nphrase \u201cofficer of customs or excise.\u201d Petitioner suggests\nthat the common attribute is that both types of officers are\ncharged with enforcing the customs and excise laws. But\nwe see no reason why that should be the relevant charac\nteristic as opposed to, for example, that officers of that\ntype are commonly involved in the activities enumerated\nin the statute: the assessment and collection of taxes and\ncustoms duties and the detention of property.\n    Petitioner\u2019s appeals to other interpretive principles are\nalso unconvincing. Petitioner contends that his reading is\nsupported by the canon noscitur a sociis, according to\nwhich \u201ca word is known by the company it keeps.\u201d S. D.\nWarren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547\nU. S. 370, 378 (2006). But the cases petitioner cites in\n12            ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsupport of applying noscitur a sociis involved statutes with\nstronger contextual cues. See Gutierrez v. Ada, 528 U. S.\n250, 254\u2013258 (2000) (applying the canon to narrow the\nrelevant phrase, \u201cany election,\u201d where it was closely sur\nrounded by six specific references to gubernatorial elec\ntions); Jarecki, supra, at 306\u2013309 (applying the canon to\nnarrow the term \u201cdiscoveries\u201d to discoveries of mineral\nresources where it was contained in a list of three words,\nall of which applied to the oil, gas, and mining industries\nand could not conceivably all apply to any other industry).\nHere, although customs and excise are mentioned twice in\n\u00a72680(c), nothing in the overall statutory context suggests\nthat customs and excise officers were the exclusive focus of\nthe provision. The emphasis in subsection (c) on customs\nand excise is not inconsistent with the conclusion that\n\u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d sweeps as broadly as\nits language suggests.\n   Similarly, the rule against superfluities lends petitioner\nsparse support. The construction we adopt today does not\nnecessarily render \u201cany officer of customs or excise\u201d super\nfluous; Congress may have simply intended to remove any\ndoubt that officers of customs or excise were included in\n\u201claw enforcement officers.\u201d See Fort Stewart Schools v.\nFLRA, 495 U. S. 641, 646 (1990) (noting that \u201ctechnically\nunnecessary\u201d examples may have been \u201cinserted out of an\nabundance of caution\u201d). Moreover, petitioner\u2019s construc\ntion threatens to render \u201cany other law enforcement offi\ncer\u201d superfluous because it is not clear when, if ever,\n\u201cother law enforcement officer[s]\u201d act in a customs or\nexcise capacity.6 In any event, we do not woodenly apply\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 As an example of \u201cother law enforcement officer[s]\u201d acting in an\n\nexcise or customs capacity, petitioner cites Formula One Motors, Ltd. v.\nUnited States, 777 F. 2d 822, 823\u2013824 (CA2 1985) (holding that the\nseizure of a vehicle still in transit from overseas by Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (DEA) agents who searched it for drugs was \u201csuffi\nciently akin to the functions carried out by Customs officials to place\n                     Cite as: 552 U.

See Harrison, 446\nU. S., at 589, n. 6 (rejecting an argument that ejusdem\ngeneris must apply when a broad interpretation of\nthe clause could render the specific enumerations\nunnecessary).\n  In the end, we are unpersuaded by petitioner\u2019s attempt\nto create ambiguity where the statute\u2019s text and structure\nsuggest none. Had Congress intended to limit \u00a72680(c)\u2019s\nreach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written\n\u201cany other law enforcement officer acting in a customs or\nexcise capacity.\u201d Instead, it used the unmodified, all-\nencompassing phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer.\u201d\nNothing in the statutory context requires a narrowing\nconstruction\u2014indeed, as we have explained, the statute is\nmost consistent and coherent when \u201cany other law en\nforcement officer\u201d is read to mean what it literally says.\nSee Norfolk & Western R. Co., 499 U. S., at 129 (noting\nthat interpretive canons must yield \u201cwhen the whole\ncontext dictates a different conclusion\u201d). It bears empha\nsis, moreover, that \u00a72680(c), far from maintaining sover\neign immunity for the entire universe of claims against\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe agents\u2019 conduct within the scope of section 2680(c)\u201d). But it is not\nclear that the agents in that case were acting in an excise or customs\ncapacity rather than in their ordinary capacity as law enforcement\nagents. It seems to us that DEA agents searching a car for drugs are\nacting in their capacity as officers charged with enforcing the Nation\u2019s\ndrug laws, not the customs or excise laws.\n  Similarly, the dissent notes that 14 U. S. C. \u00a789(a) authorizes Coast\nGuard officers to enforce customs laws. Post, at 5-6. But the very next\nsubsection of \u00a789 provides that Coast Guard officers effectively are\ncustoms officers when they enforce customs laws. See \u00a789(b)(1) (provid\ning that Coast Guard officers \u201cinsofar as they are engaged, pursuant to\nthe authority contained in this section, in enforcing any law of the\nUnited States shall . . . be deemed to be acting as agents of the particu\nlar executive department . . . charged with the administration of the\nparticular law\u201d). As a result, a Coast Guard officer enforcing a customs\nlaw is a customs officer, not some \u201cother law enforcement officer.\u201d\n14             ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw enforcement officers, does so only for claims \u201carising\nin respect of\u201d the \u201cdetention\u201d of property. We are not at\nliberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem\nmore desirable.7 Instead, we must give effect to the text\nCongress enacted: Section 2680(c) forecloses lawsuits\nagainst the United States for the unlawful detention of\nproperty by \u201cany,\u201d not just \u201csome,\u201d law enforcement\nofficers.\n                           III\n For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit is\n                                            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7Congress, we note, did provide an administrative remedy for lost\nproperty claimants like petitioner.

The respect is not enhanced,\nhowever, by decisions that foreclose consideration of the\ntext within the whole context of the statute as a guide to\ndetermining a legislature\u2019s intent. To prevent textual\nanalysis from becoming so rarefied that it departs from\nhow a legislator most likely understood the words when he\nor she voted for the law, courts use certain interpretative\nrules to consider text within the statutory design. These\ncanons do not demand wooden reliance and are not by\nthemselves dispositive, but they do function as helpful\nguides in construing ambiguous statutory provisions. Two\nof these accepted rules are ejusdem generis and noscitur a\nsociis, which together instruct that words in a series\nshould be interpreted in relation to one another.\n  Today the Court holds, if my understanding of its opin\nion is correct, that there is only one possible way to read\nthe statute. Placing implicit reliance upon a comma at the\nbeginning of a clause, the Court says that the two maxims\nnoted, and indeed other helpful and recognized principles\nof statutory analysis, are not useful as interpretative aids\nin this case because the clause cannot be understood by\nwhat went before. In my respectful submission the\n2           ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nCourt\u2019s approach is incorrect as a general rule and as\napplied to the statute now before us. Both the analytic\nframework and the specific interpretation the Court now\nemploys become binding on the federal courts, which will\nconfront other cases in which a series of words operate in a\nclause similar to the one we consider today. So this case is\ntroubling not only for the result the Court reaches but also\nfor the analysis it employs. My disagreements with the\nCourt lead to this dissent.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows those who\nallege injury from governmental actions over a vast sphere\nto seek damages for tortious conduct. The enacting Con\ngress enumerated 13 exceptions to the Act\u2019s broad waiver\nof sovereign immunity, all of which shield the Government\nfrom suit in specific instances. These exceptions must be\ngiven careful consideration in order to prevent interfer\nence with the governmental operations described. As\nnoted in Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9\n(1984), however, \u201cunduly generous interpretations of the\nexceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of\nthe statute.\u201d\n   As the Court states, at issue here is the extent of the\nexception for suits arising from the detention of goods in\ndefined circumstances. The relevant provision excepts\nfrom the general waiver\n    \u201cclaim[s] arising in respect of the assessment or collec\n    tion of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of\n    any goods, merchandise, or other property by any offi\n    cer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement\n    officer.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c).\n   Both on first reading and upon further, close considera\ntion, the plain words of the statute indicate that the excep\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntion is concerned only with customs and taxes. The provi\nsion begins with a clause dealing exclusively with customs\nand tax duties. And the provision as a whole contains four\nexpress references to customs and tax, making revenue\nduties and customs and excise officers its most salient\nfeatures. Cf. Gutierrez v. Ada, 528 U. S. 250, 254\u2013255\n(2000).\n   This is not to suggest that the Court\u2019s reading is wholly\nimpermissible or without some grammatical support.\nAfter all, detention of goods is not stated until the outset\nof the second clause and at the end of the same clause the\nwords \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d appear; so it can\nbe argued that the first and second clauses of the provision\nare so separate that all detentions by all law enforcement\nofficers in whatever capacity they might act are covered.\nStill, this ought not be the preferred reading; for between\nthe beginning of the second clause and its closing refer\nence to \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d appears an\nother reference to \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\u201d this\ntime in the context of property detention. This is quite\nsufficient, in my view, to continue the limited scope of the\nexception. At the very least, the Court errs by adopting a\nrule which simply bars all consideration of the canons of\nejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis. And when those\ncanons are consulted, together with other common princi\nples of interpretation, the case for limiting the exception to\ncustoms and tax more than overcomes the position main\ntained by the Government and adopted by the Court.\n   The ejusdem generis canon provides that, where a seem\ningly broad clause constitutes a residual phrase, it must\nbe controlled by, and defined with reference to, the \u201cenu\nmerated categories . . . which are recited just before it,\u201d so\nthat the clause encompasses only objects similar in na\nture. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 115\n(2001). The words \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d\nimmediately follow the statute\u2019s reference to \u201cofficer[s] of\n4           ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncustoms or excise,\u201d as well as the first clause\u2019s reference to\nthe assessment of tax and customs duties. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72680(c).\n   The Court counters that \u00a72680(c) \u201cis disjunctive, with\none specific and one general category,\u201d rendering ejusdem\ngeneris inapplicable. Ante, at 10. The canon\u2019s applicabil\nity, however, is not limited to those statutes that include a\nlaundry list of items. See, e.g., Norfolk & Western R. Co. v.\nTrain Dispatchers, 499 U. S. 117, 129 (1991) (\u201c[W]hen a\ngeneral term follows a specific one, the general term\nshould be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the\none with specific enumeration\u201d). In addition, ejusdem\ngeneris is often invoked in conjunction with the interpreta\ntive canon noscitur a sociis, which provides that words are\nto be \u201c \u2018known by their companions.\u2019 \u201d Washington State\nDept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate\nof Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003) (quoting Gutierrez,\nsupra, at 255). The general rule is that the \u201cmeaning of a\nword, and, consequently, the intention of the legislature,\u201d\nshould be \u201cascertained by reference to the context, and by\nconsidering whether the word in question and the sur\nrounding words are, in fact, ejusdem generis, and referable\nto the same subject-matter.\u201d Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704,\n709 (1878) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   A proper reading of \u00a72680(c) thus attributes to the last\nphrase (\u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d) the discrete\ncharacteristic shared by the preceding phrases (\u201cofficer[s]\nof customs or excise\u201d and \u201cassessment or collection of any\ntax or customs duty\u201d). See also Norton v. Southern Utah\nWilderness Alliance, 542 U.

Had Congress intended otherwise, in all\nlikelihood it would have drafted the section to apply to\n\u201cany law enforcement officer, including officers of customs\nand excise,\u201d rather than tacking \u201cany other law enforce\nment officer\u201d on the end of the enumerated categories as it\ndid here.\n   The common attribute of officers of customs and excise\nand other law enforcement officers is the performance of\nfunctions most often assigned to revenue officers, includ\ning, inter alia, the enforcement of the United States\u2019 reve\nnue laws and the conduct of border searches. Although\nofficers of customs and officers of excise are in most in\nstances the only full-time staff charged with this duty,\nofficers of other federal agencies and general law enforce\nment officers often will be called upon to act in the tradi\ntional capacity of a revenue officer. For example, Drug\nEnforcement Administration (DEA) or Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) agents frequently assist customs\nofficials in the execution of border searches. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Gurr, 471 F. 3d 144, 147\u2013149 (CADC\n2006) (FBI involved in search of financial documents at\nborder); United States v. Boumelhem, 339 F. 3d 414, 424\n(CA6 2003) (\u201cFBI had been cooperating with Customs as a\npart of a joint task force\u201d); Formula One Motors, Ltd. v.\nUnited States, 777 F. 2d 822, 824 (CA2 1985) (DEA agents\nwere performing functions traditionally carried out by\nCustoms officials where they seized and searched an\nautomobile that had been shipped from abroad and was\nstill in its shipping container). Cf. United States v.\nSchoor, 597 F. 2d 1303, 1305\u20131306 (CA9 1979) (upholding\nconstitutionality of cooperation amongst federal agencies\nin border searches). Similarly, 14 U. S. C. \u00a789(a) grants\nthe Coast Guard plenary authority to stop and board\nAmerican vessels to inspect for obvious customs violations.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gil-Carmona, 497 F. 3d 52 (CA1\n6           ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n2007) (Coast Guard assisted an Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement patrol aircraft in interdicting a vessel off the\ncoast of Puerto Rico). To the extent they detain goods\nwhose possession violates customs laws, the Coast Guard\nofficers\u2014while not \u201cofficer[s] of customs or excise,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72680(c)\u2014are without doubt engaging in the\nenforcement of the United States\u2019 revenue laws.\n   The same is true in the tax context. Under 26 U. S. C.\n\u00a76321, a delinquent taxpayer\u2019s property is subject to forfei\nture, see Glass City Bank v. United States, 326 U. S. 265\n(1945), and may be seized by any federal agent assisting\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in executing the forfei\nture, cf. United States v. $515,060.42 in United States\nCurrency, 152 F. 3d 491, 495 (CA6 1998) (IRS and FBI\njointly seized currency). Thus, the final phrase \u201cany other\nlaw enforcement officer\u201d has work to do and makes consid\nerable sense when the statute is limited in this way.\n                              B\n   The Court reaches its contrary conclusion by concentrat\ning on the word \u201cany\u201d before the phrase \u201cother law en\nforcement officer.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c). It takes this\nsingle last phrase to extend the statute so that it covers all\ndetentions of property by any law enforcement officer in\nwhatever capacity he or she acts. There are fundamental\nproblems with this approach, in addition to the ones al\nready mentioned.\n   First, the Court\u2019s analysis cannot be squared with the\nlongstanding recognition that a single word must not be\nread in isolation but instead defined by reference to its\nstatutory context. See King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, 502\nU. S. 215, 221 (1991) (\u201c[T]he meaning of statutory lan\nguage, plain or not, depends on context\u201d); Dolan v. Postal\nService, 546 U. S. 481, 486 (2006) (\u201cA word in a statute\nmay or may not extend to the outer limits of its defini\ntional possibilities. Interpretation of a word or phrase\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

The word\n\u201cany\u201d can mean \u201cdifferent things depending upon the\nsetting,\u201d Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, 541 U. S.\n125, 132 (2004); see also Small v. United States, 544 U.

Palmer, 3 Wheat.\n610, 631 (1818).\n  In Gutierrez, 528 U. S., at 254\u2013255, for example, we held\nthat the phrase \u201cin any election\u201d in the Organic Act of\nGuam, 48 U. S. C. \u00a71422, does not refer broadly to all\nelections but only to the election of Guam\u2019s Governor and\nLieutenant Governor. The Court explained that the refer\nence to \u201cany election\u201d is preceded by two references to\ngubernatorial elections and followed by four more refer\nences. In the context of such \u201crelentless repetition,\u201d the\nCourt concluded that the phrase must be \u201cknown by [its]\ncompanions.\u201d 528 U. S., at 255. Likewise, in United\nStates v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 357 (1994), the\nCourt addressed a phrase similar to the statutory provi\nsion we interpret today. The Court noted that the respon\ndent erred in \u201cplacing dispositive weight on the broad\nstatutory reference to \u2018any\u2019 law enforcement officer or\nagency without considering the rest of the statute,\u201d and\nconsulted instead \u201c \u2018the context in which [the phrase] is\nused.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 358 (quoting Deal v. United States, 508\nU. S. 129, 132 (1993); alteration in original).\n  As already mentioned, the context of \u00a72680(c) suggests\nthat, in accordance with these precedents, the statutory\nprovision should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to\ncustoms and revenue duties.

See ante, at 4, n. 2. It is important, however,\nto bear in mind that, in the context of detention of goods\nby customs and tax agents, it will be the rare case when\nproperty is voluntarily turned over, rather than forcibly\nappropriated; indeed, customs and tax agents are in the\nregular business of seizing and forfeiting property, as are\nlaw enforcement agents acting in the capacity of revenue\nenforcement.

On\nthe other hand, the majority of the nine federal statutes\nother than \u00a72680(c) containing a reference to the detention\nof goods, merchandise, or other property are specific to\ncustoms and excise.

At the very least, it demonstrates that\n\u201cdetention\u201d will be a difficult concept to apply case-by-case\nunder the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u2014a\nproblem alleviated by limiting the statute to customs and\ntax.\n  Second, the Court\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201cany\nother law enforcement officer\u201d runs contrary to \u201c \u2018our duty\n\u201cto give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a\nstatute.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Duncan v.

The Court\u2019s reading renders \u201cofficer[s] of\ncustoms or excise\u201d mere surplusage, as there would have\nbeen no need for Congress to have specified that officers of\ncustoms and officers of excise were immune if they indeed\nwere subsumed within the allegedly all-encompassing\n\u201cany\u201d officer clause. See Circuit City Stores, 532 U. S., at\n114.\n  Third, though the final reference to \u201cany other law\nenforcement officer\u201d does result in some ambiguity, the\nlegislative history, by virtue of its exclusive reference to\ncustoms and excise, confirms that Congress did not shift\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946) (in\ndiscussing 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c) referring only to \u201cthe de\ntention of goods by customs officers\u201d); A. Holtzoff, Report\non Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 16 (1931) (noting\nthat the property-detention exception was added to the\nlegislation to \u201cinclude immunity from liability in respect of\nloss in connection with the detention of goods or merchan\ndise by any officer of customs or excise\u201d).\n   Indeed, the Court\u2019s construction reads the exception to\ndefeat the central purpose of the statute, an interpretative\ndanger the Court has warned against in explicit terms.\nSee Kosak, 465 U. S., at 854, n. 9 (the Court must identify\nonly \u201c \u2018those circumstances which are within the words\nand reason of the exception\u2019\u2014no less and no more\u201d (quot\ning Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S. 15, 31 (1953)). It\nis difficult to conceive that the FTCA, which was enacted\nby Congress to make the tort liability of the United States\n\u201cthe same as that of a private person under like circum\nstance[s],\u201d S. Rep. No. 1400, at 32, would allow any officer\nunder any circumstance to detain property without being\naccountable under the Act to those injured by his or her\ntortious conduct. If Congress wanted to say that all law\nenforcement officers may detain property without liability\nin tort, including when they perform general law enforce\nment tasks, it would have done so in more express terms;\none would expect at least a reference to law enforcement\nofficers outside the customs or excise context either in the\ntext of the statute or in the legislative history. In the\nabsence of that reference, the Court ought not presume\nthat the liberties of the person who owns the property\nwould be so lightly dismissed and disregarded.\n12          ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                                II \n\n                                 A\n\n   The 2000 amendments do not require a contrary conclu\nsion. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000\n(CAFRA), as applicable here, limits the operation of\n\u00a72680(c)\u2019s exception. See \u00a73(a), 114 Stat. 211. The limita\ntion (i.e. the exception to the exception) applies where\nthere has been an injury or loss of goods and \u201cthe property\nwas seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provi\nsion of Federal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c)(1). In my view\nthe amendment establishes that officers of customs and\nexcise, and law enforcement officials performing functions\ntraditionally reserved for revenue officers, shall be liable\nin tort for damage to the property when the owner\u2019s inter\nest in the goods in the end is not forfeited (and when other\nconditions apply). And this is so regardless of whether\nthe officer acted under the revenue laws of the United\nStates or, alternatively, another civil or criminal forfeiture\nprovision.\n   The majority\u2019s reading of CAFRA for a contrary proposi\ntion is premised on the assumption that there is no cir\ncumstance in which a customs or excise officer, or a officer\nacting in such a capacity, would \u201cenforce civil forfeiture\nlaws unrelated to customs or excise.\u201d Ante, at 9. But\ncustoms and tax officials, along with law enforcement\nofficers performing customs and tax duties, routinely do\njust that. See, e.g., Customs and Border Protection, Sei\nzures and Penalties Links, http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/\ntoolbox/legal/authority_enforce/seizures_penalties.xml (CBP\nhas \u201cfull authority to . . . seize merchandise for violation of\nCBP laws or those of other federal agencies that are en\nforced by CBP\u201d). Indeed, the customs laws expressly\ncontemplate forfeitures and seizures of property under\nnonrevenue provisions. See, e.g., 19 U. S. C. \u00a71600 (\u201cThe\nprocedures [governing seizures of property] set forth in\n[\u00a7\u00a71602\u20131619] shall apply to seizures of any property\n                  Cite as: 552 U.

S. C. \u00a75317(c)\n(2000 ed., Supp. V); or of counterfeit instruments, illegal\nmusic recordings, or firearms under the Contraband Act,\n49 U. S. C. \u00a780302 et seq. Similarly, a DEA agent assist\ning a customs official in a border search (and thus acting\nin a customs capacity) might effect a civil forfeiture of\nvehicles or goods associated with the drug trade under\nfederal drug laws. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7881; see also, e.g.,\nFormula One Motors, 777 F. 2d, at 822\u2013823. Though\nacting pursuant to a civil forfeiture law that is not specific\nto customs and taxes, the DEA agent would be covered by\n\u00a72680(c)\u2019s exception to the exception because he or she\nwould be acting in a traditional revenue capacity\u2014that of\nconducting a routine search of persons and effects of per\nsons crossing an international boundary.\n   The Court counters that the Bank Secrecy Act, 31\nU. S. C. \u00a75317(c), is not \u201cunrelated to customs or excise\u201d\nbecause it cross-references a requirement for exporting\nand importing monetary instruments, \u00a75316. See ante, at\n8, n. 5. But \u00a75316, despite being \u201c[r]elated\u201d to customs\nduties, is part of the federal Currency and Foreign Trans\nactions Reporting Act, see \u00a75311 et seq. (2000 ed. and\nSupp. IV), not the United States\u2019 customs laws.\n   The Court also notes that customs agents have the\nauthority to seize contraband under the customs laws,\nparticularly 19 U. S. C. \u00a71595a(c)(1). I do not dispute that\ncustoms agents often act under customs laws when seizing\nproperty. My point, which goes unrefuted by the Court, is\nthat it was reasonable for Congress to have specified that\ncustoms and excise officers would be covered by the excep\ntion to the exception even when acting pursuant to federal\n14          ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nlaws more generally. For instance, \u00a71595a(c)(1) applies\nonly where \u201c[m]erchandise . . . is introduced . . . into the\nUnited States contrary to law,\u201d which appears to target\nthe importation of property subject to duty or entry re\nstrictions. Title 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c), by contrast, was\namended in 2000 to encompass not only the detention of\n\u201cgoods or merchandise\u201d but the detention of all \u201cproperty.\u201d\n\u00a73(a), 114 Stat. 211. In circumstances not involving im\nported \u201cmerchandise,\u201d then, the customs official would be\nacting pursuant to law enforcement authority derived not\nfrom the customs laws but, inter alia, the Contraband and\nBank Secrecy Acts. The same is true of noncustoms offi\ncers acting in a customs capacity.\n  At the very least this renders the Court\u2019s reliance on the\nviews of a subsequent Congress suspect. We have said\n\u201csubsequent acts can shape or focus\u201d the meaning of a\nstatute. FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529\nU. S. 120, 143 (2000). There is no indication, however,\nthat by adding a forfeiture exception to the exception,\nCongress intended to broaden the scope of the original\nimmunity. Cf. SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau,\nInc., 375 U. S. 180, 199\u2013200 (1963).\n                             B\n   Though the Court does not much rely on the point,\nperhaps it has concerns respecting suits like the one now\nbefore us. Petitioner sues for lost property valued at about\n$177. Law enforcement officers in the federal prison\nsystem must take inventory of the property they store,\nand with just under 200,000 persons in the federal\nprison population, see Federal Bureau of Prisons, Weekly\nPopulation Report, online at http://www.bop.gov/news/\nweekly_report.jsp (reporting 199,342 federal inmates as of\nJanuary 7, 2008), the burden on the Government to ac\ncount for missing items of little value could be a substan\ntial one.\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)             15\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   There are sound reasons, though, for rejecting this\nconcern in interpreting the statute. To begin with, as\nalready discussed, if it were a congressional objective to\ngive a comprehensive exception to all officers who detain\nproperty, Congress most likely would have written a spe\ncific provision to address the point, quite apart from the\nspecial concerns it had with customs and revenue. The\nexception as the Court now interprets it extends not only\nto trivial detentions, not only to prison officials, not only to\nthose in custody, but to all detentions of property of what\never value held by all law enforcement officials, a reading\nthat simply does not comport with the plain text and\ncontext of the statute.\n   Second, as the Court observed when interpreting an\nother exception that raised the concern of numerous frivo\nlous claims, liability for negligent transmission \u201cis a risk\nshared by any business [involved in management of deten\ntion facilities],\u201d including the Government. Dolan, 546\nU. S., at 491.\n   Third, there are already in place administrative proce\ndures that must be exhausted before the suit is allowed,\ndiminishing the number of frivolous suits that would be\nheard in federal court. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71997e(a) (\u201cNo\naction shall be brought with respect to prison conditions\nunder section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law,\nby a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correc\ntional facility until such administrative remedies as are\navailable are exhausted\u201d). Under 28 CFR \u00a7543.31(a)\n(2007), the \u201cowner of the damaged or lost property\u201d first\nmust file an FTCA claim with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)\nregional office; the BOP, in turn, is authorized by statute\nto settle administrative claims for not more than $1,000,\nsee 31 U. S. C. \u00a73723(a), which likely encompasses most\nclaims brought by federal prisoners. Only if the prisoner\nis \u201cdissatisfied with the final agency action\u201d may he or she\nfile suit in an \u201cappropriate U. S. District Court.\u201d 28 CFR\n16            ALI v.

The seizure of\nproperty by an officer raises serious concerns for the lib\nerty of our people and the Act should not be read to permit\nappropriation of property without a remedy in tort by\nlanguage so obscure and indirect.\n  For these reasons, in my view, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals ought to be reversed.\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(c). But I\nwrite separately to emphasize, as JUSTICE KENNEDY\u2019s\ndissent itself makes clear, that the relevant context ex\ntends well beyond Latin canons and other such purely\ntextual devices.\n  As with many questions of statutory interpretation, the\nissue here is not the meaning of the words. The dictionary\nmeaning of each word is well known. Rather, the issue is\nthe statute\u2019s scope. What boundaries did Congress intend\nto set? To what circumstances did Congress intend the\nphrase, as used in this statutory provision, to apply? The\nmajority answers this question by referring to an amend\nment that creates an exception for certain forfeitures and\nby emphasizing the statutory word \u201cany.\u201d As to the\namendment, I find JUSTICE KENNEDY\u2019s counterargument\nconvincing. See ante, at 11\u201313. And, in my view, the word\n\u201cany\u201d provides no help whatsoever.\n  The word \u201cany\u201d is of no help because all speakers (in\ncluding writers and legislators) who use general words\nsuch as \u201call,\u201d \u201cany,\u201d \u201cnever,\u201d and \u201cnone\u201d normally rely\nupon context to indicate the limits of time and place\n2           ALI v.

That is to say, it is context, not a diction\nary, that sets the boundaries of time, place, and circum\nstance within which words such as \u201cany\u201d will apply. See\nUnited States v.

The textual context in\ncludes the location of the phrase within a provision that\notherwise exclusively concerns customs and revenue du\nties. And the nontextual context includes several features\nthat, taken together, indicate that Congress intended a\nnarrow tort-liability exception related to customs and\nexcise.\n   First, drafting history shows that the relevant portion of\nthe bill that became the Federal Tort Claims Act con\ncerned only customs and excise. Initially, the relevant\nprovision of the bill exempted only claims \u201carising in\nrespect of the assessment or collection of any tax or cus\ntoms duty.\u201d See, e.g., S. 4377, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4\n(1930). In 1931, a Special Assistant to the Attorney Gen\neral, Alexander Holtzoff, wrote additional draft language,\nnamely, \u201cor the detention of any goods or merchandise by\nany officer of customs or excise or any other law enforce\nment officer.\u201d Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims\nBill 2 (1931) (emphasis added). Holtzoff, in a report to a\ncongressional agency, said that the expanded language\nsought \u201cto include immunity from liability in respect of\n4           ALI v. FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nloss in connection with the detention of goods or merchan\ndise by any officer of customs or excise.\u201d Id., at 16. Holt\nzoff explained that the language was suggested by a simi\nlar British bill that mentioned only customs and excise\nofficials. Ibid. (referring to the bill proposed in the Crown\nProceedings Committee Report \u00a711(5)(c), pp. 17\u201318 (Apr.\n1927) (Cmd. 2842) (\u201cNo proceedings shall lie under this\nsection . . . for or in respect of the loss of or any deteriora\ntion or damage occasioned to, or any delay in the release\nof, any goods or merchandise by reason of anything done\nor omitted to be done by any officer of customs and excise\nacting as such\u201d)); see Kosak v. United States, 465 U. S.\n848, 857, n. 13 (1984) (While \u201cthe ideas expressed [in\nHoltzoff\u2019s report] should not be given great weight in\ndetermining the intent of the Legislature,\u201d at least in\nsome circumstances, \u201cit seems to us senseless to ignore\nentirely the views of [the provision\u2019s] draftsman\u201d). And\nMembers of Congress repeatedly referred to the exception\nas encompassing claims involving customs and excise\nfunctions. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 2428, 76th Cong., 3d\nSess., p. 5 (1940); S. Rep. No. 1196, 77th Cong., 2d Sess.,\np. 7 (1942); H. R. Rep. No. 2245, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10\n(1942); H. R. Rep. No. 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6\n(1945); S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 33 (1946).\n   Second, insofar as Congress sought, through the Act\u2019s\nexceptions, to preclude tort suits against the Government\nwhere \u201cadequate remedies were already available,\u201d Kosak,\nsupra, at 858; see S. Rep. No. 1400, supra, at 33; H. R.\nRep. No. 1287, supra, at 6 (setting forth that purpose), a\nlimited exception makes sense; a broad exception does not.\nOther statutes already provided recovery for plaintiffs\nharmed by federal officers enforcing customs and tax laws\nbut not for plaintiffs harmed by all other federal officers\nenforcing most other laws. See Bazuaye v. United States,\n83 F. 3d 482, 485\u2013486 (CADC 1996) (detailing history).\n   Third, the practical difference between a limited and a\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)          5\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbroad interpretation is considerable, magnifying the im\nportance of the congressional silence to which JUSTICE\nKENNEDY points, see ante, at 11. A limited interpretation\nof the phrase \u201cany other law enforcement officer\u201d would\nlikely encompass only those law enforcement officers\nworking, say, at borders and helping to enforce customs\nand excise laws. The majority instead interprets this\nprovision to include the tens of thousands of officers per\nforming unrelated tasks. The Justice Department esti\nmates that there are more than 100,000 law enforcement\nofficers, not including members of the armed services.\nSee, e.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics\nBulletin, Federal Law Enforcement Officers, 2004, p. 1\n(July 2006). And although the law\u2019s history contains\nmuch that indicates the provision\u2019s scope is limited to\ncustoms and excise, it contains nothing at all suggesting\nan intent to apply the provision more broadly, indeed, to\nmultiply the number of officers to whom it applies by what\nis likely one or more orders of magnitude. It is thus not\nthe Latin canons, ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis,\nthat shed light on the application of the statutory phrase\nbut JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s more pertinent and easily remem\nbered English-language observation that Congress \u201cdoes\nnot . . . hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d Whitman v. Ameri\ncan Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001).\n   For these reasons, I dissent and I join JUSTICE KEN\nNEDY\u2019s dissent.\n",

Maher, Dallas, TX, for Petitioner.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*834</span> Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680, which carves out certain exceptions to the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity for torts committed by federal employees. Section 2680(c) provides that the waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to claims arising from the detention of property by \"any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\" Petitioner contends that this clause applies only to law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws, and thus does not affect the waiver of sovereign immunity for his property claim against officers of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). We conclude that the broad phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" covers all law enforcement officers. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding the dismissal of petitioner's claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner Abdus-Shahid M.S. Ali was a federal prisoner at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2001 to 2003. In December 2003, petitioner was scheduled to be transferred to the United States Penitentiary Big Sandy (USP Big Sandy) in Inez, Kentucky. Before being transferred, he left two duffle bags containing his personal property in the Atlanta prison's Receiving and Discharge Unit to be inventoried, packaged, and shipped to USP Big Sandy. Petitioner was transferred, and his bags arrived some days later. Upon inspecting his property, he noticed that several items were missing. The staff at USP Big Sandy's Receiving and Discharge Unit told him that he had been given everything that was sent, and that if things were missing he could file a claim. Many of the purportedly missing items were of religious and nostalgic significance, including two copies of the Qur'an, a prayer rug, and religious magazines. Petitioner estimated that the items were worth $177.</p>\n<p>Petitioner filed an administrative tort claim. In denying relief, the agency noted that, by his signature on the receipt form, petitioner had certified the accuracy of the inventory listed thereon and had thereby relinquished any future claims relating to missing or damaged property. Petitioner then filed a complaint alleging, <i>inter alia,</i> violations of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2671 <i>et seq.</i> The BOP maintained that petitioner's claim was barred by the exception in \u00a7 2680(c) for property claims against law enforcement officers. The District Court agreed and dismissed petitioner's FTCA claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p>The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District Court's interpretation of \u00a7 2680(c). 204 Fed.Appx. 778, 779-780 (2006) <i>(per curiam).</i> In rejecting petitioner's arguments, the Court of Appeals relied on this Court's broad interpretation of \u00a7 2680(c)'s \"detention\" clause in <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111121\"><a href=\"/opinion/111121/kosak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 854-859, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), on decisions by other Courts of Appeals, and on its own decision in <i>Schlaebitz v.

See 204 Fed. Appx., at 779-780.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2875, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007), to resolve the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to the scope of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*835</span> \u00a7 2680(c).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>In the FTCA, Congress waived the United States' sovereign immunity for claims arising out of torts committed by federal employees. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). As relevant here, the FTCA authorizes \"claims against the United States, for money damages ... for injury or loss of property ... caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The FTCA exempts from this waiver certain categories of claims. See \u00a7\u00a7 2680(a)-(n). Relevant here is the exception in subsection (c), which provides that \u00a7 1346(b) shall not apply to \"[a]ny claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\" \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p>This case turns on whether the BOP officers who allegedly lost petitioner's property qualify as \"other law enforcement officer[s]\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2680(c).<sup>[2]</sup> Petitioner argues that they do not because \"any other law enforcement officer\" includes only law enforcement officers acting in a customs or excise capacity. Noting that Congress referenced customs and excise activities in both the language at issue and the preceding clause in \u00a7 2680(c), petitioner argues that the entire subsection is focused on preserving the United States' sovereign immunity only as to officers enforcing those laws.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's argument is inconsistent with the statute's language.<sup>[3]</sup> The phrase \"<i>any</i> other law enforcement officer\" suggests a broad meaning. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). We have previously noted that \"[r]ead naturally, the word `any' has <span class=\"star-pagination\">*836</span> an expansive meaning, that is, `one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.'\" <i>United States v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118091\"><a href=\"/opinion/118091/united-states-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 97 (1976)). In <i>Gonzales,</i> we considered a provision that imposed an additional sentence for firearms used in federal drug trafficking crimes and provided that such additional sentence shall not be concurrent with \"any other term of imprisonment.\" 520 U.S., at 4, 117 S.Ct. 1032 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (emphasis deleted)). Notwithstanding the subsection's initial reference to federal drug trafficking crimes, we held that the expansive word \"any\" and the absence of restrictive language left \"no basis in the text for limiting\" the phrase \"any other term of imprisonment\" to federal sentences. 520 U.S., at 5, 117 S.Ct. 1032. Similarly, in <i>Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110265\"><a href=\"/opinion/110265/harrison-v-ppg-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span>, 100 S.Ct. 1889, 64 L.Ed.2d 525 (1980), the Court considered the phrase \"any other final action\" in amendments to the Clean Air Act. The Court explained that the amendments expanded a list of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator actions by adding two categories of actions: actions under a specifically enumerated statutory provision, and \"any other final action\" under the Clean Air Act. <i>Id.,</i> at 584, 100 S.Ct. 1889 (emphasis deleted). Focusing on Congress' choice of the word \"any,\" the Court \"discern[ed] no uncertainty in the meaning of the phrase, `any other final action,'\" and emphasized that the statute's \"expansive language offer[ed] no indication whatever that Congress intended\" to limit the phrase to final actions similar to those in the specifically enumerated sections. <i>Id.,</i> at 588-589, 100 S.Ct. 1889.</p>\n<p>We think the reasoning of <i>Gonzales</i> and <i>Harrison</i> applies equally to the expansive language Congress employed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). Congress' use of \"any\" to modify \"other law enforcement officer\" is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind.<sup>[4]</sup> The word \"any\" is repeated four times in the relevant portion of \u00a7 2680(c), and two of those instances appear in the particular phrase at issue: \"<i>any</i> officer of customs or excise or <i>any</i> other law enforcement officer.\" (Emphasis added.) Congress inserted the word \"any\" immediately before \"other law enforcement officer,\" leaving no doubt that it modifies that phrase. To be sure, the text's references to \"tax or customs duty\" and \"officer[s] of customs or excise\" indicate that Congress intended to preserve immunity for claims arising from an officer's enforcement of tax and customs laws. The text also indicates, however, that Congress intended to preserve immunity for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*837</span> claims arising from the detention of property, and there is no indication that Congress intended immunity for those claims to turn on the type of law being enforced.</p>\n<p>Petitioner would require Congress to clarify its intent to cover all law enforcement officers by adding phrases such as \"performing any official law enforcement function,\" or \"without limitation.\" But Congress could not have chosen a more all-encompassing phrase than \"any other law enforcement officer\" to express that intent. We have no reason to demand that Congress write less economically and more repetitiously.</p>\n<p>Recent amendments to \u00a7 2680(c) support the conclusion that \"any other law enforcement officer\" is not limited to officers acting in a customs or excise capacity. In the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, Congress added subsections (c)(1)(c)(4) to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680. \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. As amended, \u00a7 2680(c) provides that the \u00a7 1346(b) waiver of sovereign immunity, notwithstanding the exception at issue in this case, applies to:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[A]ny claim based on injury or loss of goods, merchandise, or other property, while in the possession of any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer, if\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(1) the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property other than as a sentence imposed upon conviction of a criminal offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) the interest of the claimant was not forfeited;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(3) the interest of the claimant was not remitted or mitigated (if the property was subject to forfeiture); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(4) the claimant was not convicted of a crime for which the interest of the claimant in the property was subject to forfeiture under a Federal criminal forfeiture law.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The amendment does not govern petitioner's claim because his property was not \"seized for the purpose of forfeiture,\" as required by paragraph (1). Nonetheless, the amendment is relevant because our construction of \"any other law enforcement officer\" must, to the extent possible, ensure that the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent. See <i>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118082\"><a href=\"/opinion/118082/robinson-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (citing <i>United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112204\"><a href=\"/opinion/112204/united-states-v-ron-pair-enterprises-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 240, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989)). The amendment canceled the exception\u0097and thus restored the waiver of sovereign immunity\u0097for certain seizures of property based on <i>any</i> federal forfeiture law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c)(1) (excepting property claims if \"the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under <i>any provision of Federal law</i> providing for the forfeiture of property\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>Under petitioner's interpretation, only law enforcement officers enforcing customs or excise laws were immune under the prior version of \u00a7 2680(c). Thus, on petitioner's reading, the amendment's only effect was to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws. This strikes us as an implausible interpretation of the statute. If that were Congress' intent, it is not apparent why Congress would have restored the waiver with respect to the enforcement of <i>all</i> civil forfeiture laws instead of simply those related to customs or excise. Petitioner's interpretation makes sense only if we assume that Congress went out of its way to restore the waiver for cases in which customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, enforce forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise. But petitioner fails to demonstrate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*838</span> that customs or excise officers, or officers acting in such a capacity, ever enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise, much less that they do so with such frequency that Congress is likely to have singled them out in the amendment.<sup>[5]</sup> It seems far more likely that Congress restored the waiver for officers enforcing <i>any</i> civil forfeiture law because, in its view, <i>all</i> such officers were covered by the exception to the waiver prior to the amendment.</p>\n<p>Against this textual and structural evidence that \"any other law enforcement officer\" does in fact mean any other law enforcement officer, petitioner invokes numerous canons of statutory construction. He relies primarily on <i>ejusdem generis,</i> or the principle that \"when a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.\" <i>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112560\"><a href=\"/opinion/112560/norfolk-western-r-co-v-train-dispatchers/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 129, 111 S.Ct. 1156, 113 L.Ed.2d 95 (1991). In petitioner's view, \"any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\" should be read as a three-item list, and the final, catchall phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" should be limited to officers of the same nature as the preceding specific phrases.</p>\n<p>Petitioner likens his case to two recent cases in which we found the canon useful. In <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122259\"><a href=\"/opinion/122259/washington-state-dept-of-social-and-health-servs-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 375, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003), we considered the clause \"execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process\" in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a). Applying <i>ejusdem generis,</i> we concluded that \"other legal process\" was limited to legal processes of the same nature as the specific items listed. 537 U.S., at 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017. The department's scheme for serving as a representative payee of the benefits due to children under its care, while a \"legal process,\" did not share the common attribute of the listed items, viz., \"utilization of some judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism ... by which control over property passes from one person to another in order to discharge\" a debt. 537 U.S., at 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017. Similarly, in <i>Dolan v. Postal Service,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145678\"><a href=\"/opinion/145678/dolan-v-postal-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 163 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*839</span> L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006), the Court considered whether an exception to the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity for claims arising out of the \"`loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter'\" barred a claim that mail negligently left on the petitioner's porch caused her to slip and fall. <i>Id.,</i> at 485, 126 S.Ct. 1252 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b)). Noting that \"loss\" and \"miscarriage\" both addressed \"failings in the postal obligation to deliver mail in a timely manner to the right address,\" 546 U.S., at 487, 126 S.Ct. 1252, the Court concluded that \"negligent transmission\" must be similarly limited, <i>id.,</i> at 486-489, 126 S.Ct. 1252, and rejected the Government's argument that the exception applied to \"all torts committed in the course of mail delivery,\" <i>id.,</i> at 490, 126 S.Ct. 1252.</p>\n<p>Petitioner asserts that \u00a7 2680(c), like the clauses at issue in <i>Keffeler</i> and <i>Dolan,</i> \"`presents a textbook <i>ejusdem generis</i> scenario.'\" Brief for Petitioner 15 (quoting <i>Andrews v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793664\"><a href=\"/opinion/793664/anthony-andrews-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (C.A.4 2006)). We disagree. The structure of the phrase \"any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer\" does not lend itself to application of the canon. The phrase is disjunctive, with one specific and one general category, not\u0097like the clauses at issue in <i>Keffeler</i> and <i>Dolan</i>\u0097a list of specific items separated by commas and followed by a general or collective term. The absence of a list of specific items undercuts the inference embodied in <i>ejusdem generis</i> that Congress remained focused on the common attribute when it used the catchall phrase. Cf. <i>United States v. Aguilar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117962\"><a href=\"/opinion/117962/united-states-v-aguilar/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, 615, 115 S.Ct. 2357, 132 L.Ed.2d 520 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (rejecting the canon's applicability to an omnibus clause that was \"one of ... several distinct and independent prohibitions\" rather than \"a general or collective term following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory command is applicable\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, it is not apparent what common attribute connects the specific items in \u00a7 2680(c). Were we to use the canon to limit the meaning of \"any other law enforcement officer,\" we would be required to determine the relevant limiting characteristic of \"officer of customs or excise.\" In <i>Jarecki v. G.D. Searle Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106270\"><a href=\"/opinion/106270/jarecki-v-gd-searle-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 81 S.Ct. 1579, 6 L.Ed.2d 859 (1961), for example, the Court invoked <i>noscitur a sociis</i> in limiting the scope of the term \"`discovery'\" to the common characteristic it shared with \"`exploration'\" and \"`prospecting.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 307, 81 S.Ct. 1579. The Court noted that all three words in conjunction \"describe[d] income-producing activity in the oil and gas and mining industries.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Here, by contrast, no relevant common attribute immediately appears from the phrase \"officer of customs or excise.\" Petitioner suggests that the common attribute is that both types of officers are charged with enforcing the customs and excise laws. But we see no reason why that should be the relevant characteristic as opposed to, for example, that officers of that type are commonly involved in the activities enumerated in the statute: the assessment and collection of taxes and customs duties and the detention of property.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's appeals to other interpretive principles are also unconvincing. Petitioner contends that his reading is supported by the canon <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> according to which \"a word is known by the company it keeps.\" <i>S.D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145656\"><a href=\"/opinion/145656/sd-warren-co-v-maine-bd-of-environmental-protectio/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 378, 126 S.Ct. 1843, 164 L.Ed.2d 625 (2006). But the cases petitioner cites in support of applying <i>noscitur a sociis</i> involved statutes with stronger contextual cues. See <i>Gutierrez v. Ada,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*840</span> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118331\"><a href=\"/opinion/118331/gutierrez-v-ada/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 254-258, 120 S.Ct. 740, 145 L.Ed.2d 747 (2000) (applying the canon to narrow the relevant phrase, \"any election,\" where it was closely surrounded by six specific references to gubernatorial elections); <i>Jarecki, supra,</i> at 306-309, 81 S.Ct. 1579 (applying the canon to narrow the term \"discoveries\" to discoveries of mineral resources where it was contained in a list of three words, all of which applied to the oil, gas, and mining industries and could not conceivably all apply to any other industry). Here, although customs and excise are mentioned twice in \u00a7 2680(c), nothing in the overall statutory context suggests that customs and excise officers were the exclusive focus of the provision. The emphasis in subsection (c) on customs and excise is not inconsistent with the conclusion that \"any other law enforcement officer\" sweeps as broadly as its language suggests.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the rule against superfluities lends petitioner sparse support. The construction we adopt today does not necessarily render \"any officer of customs or excise\" superfluous; Congress may have simply intended to remove any doubt that officers of customs or excise were included in \"law enforcement officers.\" See <i>Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112437\"><a href=\"/opinion/112437/fortstewart-schools-v-flra/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 646, 110 S.Ct. 2043, 109 L.Ed.2d 659 (1990) (noting that \"technically unnecessary\" examples may have been \"inserted out of an abundance of caution\"). Moreover, petitioner's construction threatens to render \"any other law enforcement officer\" superfluous because it is not clear when, if ever, \"other law enforcement officer[s]\" act in a customs or excise capacity.<sup>[6]</sup> In any event, we do not woodenly apply limiting principles every time Congress includes a specific example along with a general phrase. See <i>Harrison,</i> 446 U.S., at 589, n. 6, 100 S.Ct. 1889 (rejecting an argument that <i>ejusdem generis</i> must apply when a broad interpretation of the clause could render the specific enumerations unnecessary).</p>\n<p>In the end, we are unpersuaded by petitioner's attempt to create ambiguity where the statute's text and structure suggest none. Had Congress intended to limit \u00a7 2680(c)'s reach as petitioner contends, it easily could have written \"any other law enforcement officer <i>acting in a customs or excise capacity.</i>\" Instead, it used the unmodified, all-encompassing phrase \"any other law enforcement officer.\" Nothing in the statutory context requires a narrowing construction\u0097indeed, as we have explained, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*841</span> the statute is most consistent and coherent when \"any other law enforcement officer\" is read to mean what it literally says. See <i>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co.,</i> 499 U.S., at 129, 111 S.Ct. 1156 (noting that interpretive canons must yield \"when the whole context dictates a different conclusion\"). It bears emphasis, moreover, that \u00a7 2680(c), far from maintaining sovereign immunity for the entire universe of claims against law enforcement officers, does so only for claims \"arising in respect of\" the \"detention\" of property. We are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to reflect a meaning we deem more desirable.<sup>[7]</sup> Instead, we must give effect to the text Congress enacted: Section 2680(c) forecloses lawsuits against the United States for the unlawful detention of property by \"any,\" not just \"some,\" law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice SOUTER, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Statutory interpretation, from beginning to end, requires respect for the text. The respect is not enhanced, however, by decisions that foreclose consideration of the text within the whole context of the statute as a guide to determining a legislature's intent. To prevent textual analysis from becoming so rarefied that it departs from how a legislator most likely understood the words when he or she voted for the law, courts use certain interpretative rules to consider text within the statutory design. These canons do not demand wooden reliance and are not by themselves dispositive, but they do function as helpful guides in construing ambiguous statutory provisions. Two of these accepted rules are <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which together instruct that words in a series should be interpreted in relation to one another.</p>\n<p>Today the Court holds, if my understanding of its opinion is correct, that there is only one possible way to read the statute. Placing implicit reliance upon a comma at the beginning of a clause, the Court says that the two maxims noted, and indeed other helpful and recognized principles of statutory analysis, are not useful as interpretative aids in this case because the clause cannot be understood by what went before. In my respectful submission the Court's approach is incorrect as a general rule and as applied to the statute now before us. Both the analytic framework and the specific interpretation the Court now employs become binding on the federal courts, which will confront other cases in which a series of words operate in a clause similar to the one we consider today. So this case is troubling not only for the result the Court reaches but also for the analysis it employs. My disagreements with the Court lead to this dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) allows those who allege injury from governmental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*842</span> actions over a vast sphere to seek damages for tortious conduct. The enacting Congress enumerated 13 exceptions to the Act's broad waiver of sovereign immunity, all of which shield the Government from suit in specific instances. These exceptions must be given careful consideration in order to prevent interference with the governmental operations described. As noted in <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111121\"><a href=\"/opinion/111121/kosak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 853, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), however, \"unduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the statute.\"</p>\n<p>As the Court states, at issue here is the extent of the exception for suits arising from the detention of goods in defined circumstances. The relevant provision excepts from the general waiver</p>\n<blockquote>\"claim[s] arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c).</blockquote>\n<p>Both on first reading and upon further, close consideration, the plain words of the statute indicate that the exception is concerned only with customs and taxes. The provision begins with a clause dealing exclusively with customs and tax duties. And the provision as a whole contains four express references to customs and tax, making revenue duties and customs and excise officers its most salient features. Cf. <i>Gutierrez v. Ada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118331\"><a href=\"/opinion/118331/gutierrez-v-ada/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 254-255, 120 S.Ct. 740, 145 L.Ed.2d 747 (2000).</p>\n<p>This is not to suggest that the Court's reading is wholly impermissible or without some grammatical support. After all, detention of goods is not stated until the outset of the second clause and at the end of the same clause the words \"any other law enforcement officer\" appear; so it can be argued that the first and second clauses of the provision are so separate that all detentions by all law enforcement officers in whatever capacity they might act are covered. Still, this ought not be the preferred reading; for between the beginning of the second clause and its closing reference to \"any other law enforcement officer\" appears another reference to \"officer[s] of customs or excise,\" this time in the context of property detention. This is quite sufficient, in my view, to continue the limited scope of the exception. At the very least, the Court errs by adopting a rule which simply bars all consideration of the canons of <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis.</i> And when those canons are consulted, together with other common principles of interpretation, the case for limiting the exception to customs and tax more than overcomes the position maintained by the Government and adopted by the Court.</p>\n<p>The <i>ejusdem generis</i> canon provides that, where a seemingly broad clause constitutes a residual phrase, it must be controlled by, and defined with reference to, the \"enumerated categories ... which are recited just before it,\" so that the clause encompasses only objects similar in nature. <i>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118415\"><a href=\"/opinion/118415/circuit-city-stores-inc-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 115, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001). The words \"any other law enforcement officer\" immediately follow the statute's reference to \"officer[s] of customs or excise,\" as well as the first clause's reference to the assessment of tax and customs duties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n<p>The Court counters that \u00a7 2680(c) \"is disjunctive, with one specific and one general category,\" rendering <i>ejusdem generis</i> inapplicable. <i>Ante,</i> at 839. The canon's applicability, however, is not limited to those statutes that include a laundry list of items. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Norfolk &amp; Western R. Co. v. Train Dispatchers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112560\"><a href=\"/opinion/112560/norfolk-western-r-co-v-train-dispatchers/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span>, 129, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*843</span> 111 S.Ct. 1156, 113 L.Ed.2d 95 (1991) (\"[W]hen a general term follows a specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration\"). In addition, <i>ejusdem generis</i> is often invoked in conjunction with the interpretative canon <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> which provides that words are to be \"`known by their companions.'\" <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122259\"><a href=\"/opinion/122259/washington-state-dept-of-social-and-health-servs-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 384, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003) (quoting <i>Gutierrez, supra,</i> at 255, 120 S.Ct. 740). The general rule is that the \"meaning of a word, and, consequently, the intention of the legislature,\" should be \"ascertained by reference to the context, and by considering whether the word in question and the surrounding words are, in fact, <i>ejusdem generis,</i> and referable to the same subject-matter.\" <i>Neal v.

See also <i>Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136985\"><a href=\"/opinion/136985/norton-v-southern-utah-wilderness-alliance/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 62-63, 124 S.Ct. 2373, 159 L.Ed.2d 137 (2004) (applying <i>ejusdem generis</i> to conclude that \"`failure to act'\" means \"failure to take an <i>agency action</i>\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs., supra,</i> at 384-385, 123 S.Ct. 1017 (holding that the phrase \"other legal process\" in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a) refers only to the utilization of a judicial or quasi-judicial mechanism, the common attribute shared by the phrase and the statutory enumeration preceding it). Had Congress intended otherwise, in all likelihood it would have drafted the section to apply to \"any law enforcement officer, including officers of customs and excise,\" rather than tacking \"any other law enforcement officer\" on the end of the enumerated categories as it did here.</p>\n<p>The common attribute of officers of customs and excise and other law enforcement officers is the performance of functions most often assigned to revenue officers, including, <i>inter alia,</i> the enforcement of the United States' revenue laws and the conduct of border searches. Although officers of customs and officers of excise are in most instances the only full-time staff charged with this duty, officers of other federal agencies and general law enforcement officers often will be called upon to act in the traditional capacity of a revenue officer. For example, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents frequently assist customs officials in the execution of border searches. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gurr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186816\"><a href=\"/opinion/186816/united-states-v-gurr-bernard/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 147-149 (C.A.D.C.2006) (FBI involved in search of financial documents at border); <i>United States v.

Similarly, 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a) grants the Coast Guard plenary authority to stop and board American vessels to inspect for obvious customs violations. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Gil-Carmona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202859\"><a href=\"/opinion/202859/united-states-v-gil-carmona/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (C.A.1 2007) (Coast Guard assisted an Immigration <span class=\"star-pagination\">*844</span> and Customs Enforcement patrol aircraft in interdicting a vessel off the coast of Puerto Rico). To the extent they detain goods whose possession violates customs laws, the Coast Guard officers\u0097while not \"officer[s] of customs or excise,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c)\u0097are without doubt engaging in the enforcement of the United States' revenue laws.</p>\n<p>The same is true in the tax context. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6321, a delinquent taxpayer's property is subject to forfeiture, see <i>Glass City Bank v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104195\"><a href=\"/opinion/104195/glass-city-bank-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 66 S.Ct. 108, 90 L.Ed. 56 (1945), and may be seized by any federal agent assisting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in executing the forfeiture, cf. <i>United States v. $515,060.42 in United States Currency,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757055\"><a href=\"/opinion/757055/united-states-of-america-95-6579-97-5016-v-5150604/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 495 (C.A.6 1998) (IRS and FBI jointly seized currency). Thus, the final phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" has work to do and makes considerable sense when the statute is limited in this way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The Court reaches its contrary conclusion by concentrating on the word \"any\" before the phrase \"other law enforcement officer.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). It takes this single last phrase to extend the statute so that it covers all detentions of property by any law enforcement officer in whatever capacity he or she acts. There are fundamental problems with this approach, in addition to the ones already mentioned.</p>\n<p>First, the Court's analysis cannot be squared with the longstanding recognition that a single word must not be read in isolation but instead defined by reference to its statutory context. See <i>King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112670\"><a href=\"/opinion/112670/king-v-st-vincents-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991) (\"[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context\"); <i>Dolan v.

Interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text, considering the purpose and context of the statute, and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis\"). This is true even of facially broad modifiers. The word \"any\" can mean \"different things depending upon the setting,\" <i>Nixon v.

The Court explained that the reference to \"any election\" is preceded by two references to gubernatorial elections and followed by four more references. In the context of such \"relentless repetition,\" the Court concluded that the phrase must be \"known by [its] companions.\" 528 U.S., at 255, 120 S.Ct. 740. Likewise, in <i>United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087948\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087948/united-states-v-alvarez-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 357, 114 S.Ct. 1599, 128 L.Ed.2d 319 (1994), the Court addressed a phrase similar to the statutory provision we interpret today. The Court noted that the respondent erred in \"placing dispositive weight on the broad statutory reference to `any' law enforcement officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute,\" and consulted instead \"`the context in which [the phrase] is used.'\" <i>Id.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*845</span> at 358, 114 S.Ct. 1599 (quoting <i>Deal v.

Its first clause deals exclusively with customs and tax duties and, between the first and second clauses, it refers two more times to customs and tax. See <i>Gutierrez, supra,</i> at 254-255, 120 S.Ct. 740; <i>A-Mark, Inc. v. United States Secret Serv. Dept. of Treasury,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"363920\"><a href=\"/opinion/363920/a-mark-inc-v-united-states-secret-service-departme/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 851 (C.A.9 1978) (Tang, J., concurring) (\"The clauses both dwell exclusively on customs and taxes, except for the final reference to other law-enforcement officers\").</p>\n<p>Further, \u00a7 2680(c) provides that there will be immunity only where there has been a \"detention\" of goods, merchandise, or property. \"[D]etention\" is defined by legal and nonlegal dictionaries alike as a \"compulsory,\" \"forced,\" or \"punitive\" containment. Black's Law Dictionary 459 (7th ed.1999) (compulsory); American Heritage Dictionary 494 (4th ed.2000) (forced or punitive). The issue whether petitioner's property was \"detained\" within the meaning of the statute was not raised in this case; and so the Court leaves for another day the exception's applicability to these facts. See <i>ante,</i> at 835, n. 2. It is important, however, to bear in mind that, in the context of detention of goods by customs and tax agents, it will be the rare case when property is voluntarily turned over, rather than forcibly appropriated; indeed, customs and tax agents are in the regular business of seizing and forfeiting property, as are law enforcement agents acting in the capacity of revenue enforcement. See Dept. of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mid-Year FY 2007\u0097Top IPR Commodities Seized (May 2007), online at http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/ import/commercial_enforcement/ipr/ seizure/07_midyr_seizures.ctt/07_midyr_ seizures.pdf (all Internet materials as visited Jan. 10, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (by midyear 2007, customs officials had executed 7,245 commodity seizures, worth a total of $110,198,350); GAO, Border Security: Despite Progress, Weaknesses in Traveler Inspections Exist at Our Nation's Ports of Entry 17 (GAD-08-219, Nov. 2007), http://www.gao.gov/ new.items/d08219.pdf (\"According to [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] CBP, in fiscal year 2006, CBP officers ... seized more than 644,000 pounds of illegal drugs, intercepted nearly 1.7 million prohibited agricultural items, and seized over $155 million in illegal commercial merchandise, such as counterfeit footwear and handbags\" (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>In other contexts, however, the word \"detention\" may or may not accurately describe the nature of the Government action. A prisoner's voluntary decision to deliver property for transfer to another facility, for example, bears a greater similarity to a \"bailment\"\u0097the delivery of personal property after being held by the prison in trust, see American Heritage Dictionary, <i>supra,</i> at 134\u0097than to a \"detention.\"</p>\n<p>Not a single federal statute mentions the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the context of property detention. On the other hand, the majority of the nine federal statutes other than \u00a7 2680(c) containing a reference to the detention of goods, merchandise, or other property are specific to customs and excise. Compare 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1499(a) (authorizing customs agents to examine and detain imported merchandise); \u00a7 1595a(c)(3) (authorizing customs <span class=\"star-pagination\">*846</span> officials to detain merchandise introduced contrary to law); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 (authorizing internal revenue officers to detain containers containing distilled spirits, wines, or beer where there is reason to believe applicable taxes have not been paid); 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 2411(a)(2)(A) (authorizing customs officials to seize and detain goods at ports of entry in the enforcement of war and national defense); 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 464 (authorizing customs agents to detain armed vessels and any property found thereon); with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(e) (\"The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service, as the case may be, shall ensure the equitable transfer pursuant to paragraph (2) of any forfeited property to the appropriate State or local law enforcement agency .... The United States shall not be liable in any action arising out of the seizure, detention, and transfer of seized property to State or local officials\"); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c)(1) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) (appropriating a special fund for the purpose of property detention under any law enforced or administered by the Department of Justice); 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 9703(a)(1)(A) (establishing a Department of Treasury Forfeiture Fund to pay the expenses of property detention); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1540(e)(3), 3375(b) (authorizing the detention of goods and packages for inspection where there is reason to believe there has been a violation of laws governing fish, wildlife, and plants).</p>\n<p>This would seem to indicate that Congress contemplated that the statutory provision considered here would apply only in those narrow circumstances where the officer is in the regular business of forfeiting property, namely revenue enforcement. At the very least, it demonstrates that \"detention\" will be a difficult concept to apply case-by-case under the majority's interpretation of the statute\u0097a problem alleviated by limiting the statute to customs and tax.</p>\n<p>Second, the Court's construction of the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" runs contrary to \"`our duty \"to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\"'\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 174, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001) (quoting <i>United States v. Menasche,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105289\"><a href=\"/opinion/105289/united-states-v-menasche/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 538-539, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955)). The Court's reading renders \"officer[s] of customs or excise\" mere surplusage, as there would have been no need for Congress to have specified that officers of customs and officers of excise were immune if they indeed were subsumed within the allegedly all-encompassing \"any\" officer clause. See <i>Circuit City Stores,</i> 532 U.S., at 114, 121 S.Ct. 1302.</p>\n<p>Third, though the final reference to \"any other law enforcement officer\" does result in some ambiguity, the legislative history, by virtue of its exclusive reference to customs and excise, confirms that Congress did not shift its attention from the context of revenue enforcement when it used these words at the end of the statute. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S.Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946) (in discussing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c) referring only to \"the detention of goods by customs officers\"); A. Holtzoff, Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 16 (1931) (noting that the property-detention exception was added to the legislation to \"include immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise\").</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Court's construction reads the exception to defeat the central purpose of the statute, an interpretative danger the Court has warned against in explicit terms. See <i>Kosak,</i> 465 U.S., at 854, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 1519 (the Court must identify only \"`those circumstances which are within the words <span class=\"star-pagination\">*847</span> and reason of the exception'\u0097no less and no more\") (quoting <i>Dalehite v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105142\"><a href=\"/opinion/105142/dalehite-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 31, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953)). It is difficult to conceive that the FTCA, which was enacted by Congress to make the tort liability of the United States \"the same as that of a private person under like circumstance[s],\" S.Rep. No. 1400, at 32, would allow any officer under any circumstance to detain property without being accountable under the Act to those injured by his or her tortious conduct. If Congress wanted to say that all law enforcement officers may detain property without liability in tort, including when they perform general law enforcement tasks, it would have done so in more express terms; one would expect at least a reference to law enforcement officers outside the customs or excise context either in the text of the statute or in the legislative history. In the absence of that reference, the Court ought not presume that the liberties of the person who owns the property would be so lightly dismissed and disregarded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The 2000 amendments do not require a contrary conclusion. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (CAFRA), as applicable here, limits the operation of \u00a7 2680(c)'s exception. See \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. The limitation (<i>i.e.</i> the exception to the exception) applies where there has been an injury or loss of goods and \"the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c)(1). In my view the amendment establishes that officers of customs and excise, and law enforcement officials performing functions traditionally reserved for revenue officers, shall be liable in tort for damage to the property when the owner's interest in the goods in the end is not forfeited (and when other conditions apply). And this is so regardless of whether the officer acted under the revenue laws of the United States or, alternatively, another civil or criminal forfeiture provision.</p>\n<p>The majority's reading of CAFRA for a contrary proposition is premised on the assumption that there is no circumstance in which a customs or excise officer, or a officer acting in such a capacity, would \"enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 838. But customs and tax officials, along with law enforcement officers performing customs and tax duties, routinely do just that. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Customs and Border Protection, Seizures and Penalties Links, http://www.cbp. gov/xp/cgov/ toolbox/legal/authority_enforce/seizures_penalties.xml (CBP has \"full authority to ... seize merchandise for violation of CBP laws or those of other federal agencies that are enforced by CBP\"). Indeed, the customs laws expressly contemplate forfeitures and seizures of property under nonrevenue provisions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1600 (\"The procedures [governing seizures of property] set forth in [\u00a7\u00a7 1602-1619] shall apply to seizures of any property effected by customs officers under any law enforced or administered by the Customs Service unless such law specifies different procedures\").</p>\n<p>By way of example, a customs or excise official might effect a civil forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c) (2000 ed., Supp. V); or of counterfeit instruments, illegal music recordings, or firearms under the Contraband Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80302 <i>et seq.</i> Similarly, a DEA agent assisting a customs official in a border search (and thus acting in a customs capacity) might effect a civil forfeiture of vehicles or goods associated with the drug trade under federal drug laws. See 21 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*848</span> U.S.C. \u00a7 881; see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Formula One Motors,</i> 777 F.2d, at 822-823. Though acting pursuant to a civil forfeiture law that is not specific to customs and taxes, the DEA agent would be covered by \u00a7 2680(c)'s exception to the exception because he or she would be acting in a traditional revenue capacity\u0097that of conducting a routine search of persons and effects of persons crossing an international boundary.</p>\n<p>The Court counters that the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c), is not \"unrelated to customs or excise\" because it cross-references a requirement for exporting and importing monetary instruments, \u00a7 5316. See <i>ante,</i> at 838, n. 5. But \u00a7 5316, despite being \"[r]elated\" to customs duties, is part of the federal Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, see \u00a7 5311 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), not the United States' customs laws.</p>\n<p>The Court also notes that customs agents have the authority to seize contraband under the customs laws, particularly 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1595a(c)(1). I do not dispute that customs agents often act under customs laws when seizing property. My point, which goes unrefuted by the Court, is that it was reasonable for Congress to have specified that customs and excise officers would be covered by the exception to the exception even when acting pursuant to federal laws more generally. For instance, \u00a7 1595a(c)(1) applies only where \"[m]erchandise ... is introduced ... into the United States contrary to law,\" which appears to target the importation of property subject to duty or entry restrictions. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c), by contrast, was amended in 2000 to encompass not only the detention of \"goods or merchandise\" but the detention of all \"property.\" \u00a7 3(a), 114 Stat. 211. In circumstances not involving imported \"merchandise,\" then, the customs official would be acting pursuant to law enforcement authority derived not from the customs laws but, <i>inter alia,</i> the Contraband and Bank Secrecy Acts. The same is true of noncustoms officers acting in a customs capacity.</p>\n<p>At the very least this renders the Court's reliance on the views of a subsequent Congress suspect. We have said \"subsequent acts can shape or focus\" the meaning of a statute. <i>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118347\"><a href=\"/opinion/118347/fda-v-brown-williamson-tobacco-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 143, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000). There is no indication, however, that by adding a forfeiture exception to the exception, Congress intended to broaden the scope of the original immunity. Cf. <i>SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106707\"><a href=\"/opinion/106707/sec-v-capital-gains-research-bureau-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 199-200, 84 S.Ct. 275, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Though the Court does not much rely on the point, perhaps it has concerns respecting suits like the one now before us. Petitioner sues for lost property valued at about $177. Law enforcement officers in the federal prison system must take inventory of the property they store, and with just under 200,000 persons in the federal prison population, see Federal Bureau of Prisons, Weekly Population Report, online at http://www.bop.gov/news/ weekly_report.jsp (reporting 199,342 federal inmates as of January 7, 2008), the burden on the Government to account for missing items of little value could be a substantial one.</p>\n<p>There are sound reasons, though, for rejecting this concern in interpreting the statute. To begin with, as already discussed, if it were a congressional objective to give a comprehensive exception to all officers who detain property, Congress most likely would have written a specific provision to address the point, quite apart from the special concerns it had with customs and revenue. The exception as the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*849</span> Court now interprets it extends not only to trivial detentions, not only to prison officials, not only to those in custody, but to all detentions of property of whatever value held by all law enforcement officials, a reading that simply does not comport with the plain text and context of the statute.</p>\n<p>Second, as the Court observed when interpreting another exception that raised the concern of numerous frivolous claims, liability for negligent transmission \"is a risk shared by any business [involved in management of detention facilities],\" including the Government. <i>Dolan,</i> 546 U.S., at 491, 126 S.Ct. 1252.</p>\n<p>Third, there are already in place administrative procedures that must be exhausted before the suit is allowed, diminishing the number of frivolous suits that would be heard in federal court. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (\"No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\"). Under 28 CFR \u00a7 543.31(a) (2007), the \"owner of the damaged or lost property\" first must file an FTCA claim with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) regional office; the BOP, in turn, is authorized by statute to settle administrative claims for not more than $1,000, see 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723(a), which likely encompasses most claims brought by federal prisoners. Only if the prisoner is \"dissatisfied with the final agency action\" may he or she file suit in an \"appropriate U.S. District Court.\" 28 CFR \u00a7 543.32(g).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>If Congress had intended to give sweeping immunity to all federal law enforcement officials from liability for the detention of property, it would not have dropped this phrase onto the end of the statutory clause so as to appear there as something of an afterthought. The seizure of property by an officer raises serious concerns for the liberty of our people and the Act should not be read to permit appropriation of property without a remedy in tort by language so obscure and indirect.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, in my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice STEVENS joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice KENNEDY that context makes clear that Congress intended the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" to apply only to officers carrying out customs or excise duties. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(c). But I write separately to emphasize, as Justice KENNEDY's dissent itself makes clear, that the relevant context extends well beyond Latin canons and other such purely textual devices.</p>\n<p>As with many questions of statutory interpretation, the issue here is not the <i>meaning</i> of the words. The dictionary meaning of each word is well known. Rather, the issue is the statute's <i>scope.</i> What boundaries did Congress intend to set? To what circumstances did Congress intend the phrase, as used in <i>this</i> statutory provision, to apply? The majority answers this question by referring to an amendment that creates an exception for certain forfeitures and by emphasizing the statutory word \"any.\" As to the amendment, I find Justice KENNEDY's counterargument convincing. See <i>ante,</i> at 846-847. And, in my view, the word \"any\" provides no help whatsoever.</p>\n<p>The word \"any\" is of no help because all speakers (including writers and legislators) who use general words such as \"all,\" \"any,\" \"never,\" and \"none\" normally rely upon context to indicate the limits of time <span class=\"star-pagination\">*850</span> and place within which they intend those words to do their linguistic work. And with the possible exception of the assertion of a universal truth, say by a mathematician, scientist, philosopher, or theologian, such limits almost always exist. When I call out to my wife, \"There isn't any butter,\" I do not mean, \"There isn't any butter in town.\" The context makes clear to her that I am talking about the contents of our refrigerator. That is to say, it is context, not a dictionary, that sets the boundaries of time, place, and circumstance within which words such as \"any\" will apply. See <i>United States v. Palmer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85249\"><a href=\"/opinion/85249/united-states-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span>, 631, 4 L.Ed. 471 (1818) (Marshall, C.J.)

And canons such as <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis</i> offer help in evaluating the significance of those surrounding words. Yet that help is limited. That is because other contextual features can show that Congress intended a phrase to apply more broadly than the immediately surrounding words by themselves suggest. See <i>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118415\"><a href=\"/opinion/118415/circuit-city-stores-inc-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 138-140, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001) (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (finding \"good reasons\" not to apply <i>ejusdem generis</i> because the statute's history and purposes make clear that the words \"any other class of workers\" in the phrase \"seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers\" refer, not just to other transportation workers, but to workers of all kinds including retail store clerks). It is because canons of construction are not \"conclusive\" and \"are often countered ... by some maxim pointing in a different direction.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 115, 121 S.Ct. 1302 (majority opinion). And it is because these particular canons simply crystallize what English speakers already know, namely, that lists often (but not always) group together items with similar characteristics. (That is why we cannot, without comic effect, yoke radically different nouns to a single verb, <i>e.g.,</i> \"He caught three salmon, two trout, and a cold.\")</p>\n<p>In this case, not only the immediately surrounding words but also every other contextual feature supports Justice KENNEDY's conclusion. The textual context includes the location of the phrase within a provision that otherwise exclusively concerns customs and revenue duties. And the nontextual context includes several features that, taken together, indicate that Congress intended a narrow tort-liability exception related to customs and excise.</p>\n<p>First, drafting history shows that the relevant portion of the bill that became the Federal Tort Claims Act concerned only customs and excise. Initially, the relevant provision of the bill exempted only claims \"arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. 4377, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 4 (1930). In 1931, a Special Assistant to the Attorney General, Alexander Holtzoff, wrote additional draft language, namely, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*851</span> \"or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise or <i>any other law enforcement officer.</i>\" Report on Proposed Federal Tort Claims Bill 2 (1931) (emphasis added). Holtzoff, in a report to a congressional agency, said that the expanded language sought \"to include immunity from liability in respect of loss in connection with the detention of goods or merchandise by any officer of customs or excise.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 16. Holtzoff explained that the language was suggested by a similar British bill that mentioned only customs and excise officials. <i>Ibid.</i> (referring to the bill proposed in the Crown Proceedings Committee Report \u00a7 11(5)(<i>c</i>), pp. 17-18 (Apr.1927) (Cmd.2842) (\"No proceedings shall lie under this section ... for or in respect of the loss of or any deterioration or damage occasioned to, or any delay in the release of, any goods or merchandise by reason of anything done or omitted to be done by any officer of customs and excise acting as such\")); see <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111121\"><a href=\"/opinion/111121/kosak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 857, n. 13, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984) (While \"the ideas expressed [in Holtzoff's report] should not be given great weight in determining the intent of the Legislature,\" at least in some circumstances, \"it seems to us senseless to ignore entirely the views of [the provision's] draftsman\"). And Members of Congress repeatedly referred to the exception as encompassing claims involving customs and excise functions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 2428, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 5 (1940); S.Rep. No. 1196, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7 (1942); H.R.Rep. No. 2245, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 10 (1942); H.R.Rep. No. 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6 (1945); S.Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 33 (1946).</p>\n<p>Second, insofar as Congress sought, through the Act's exceptions, to preclude tort suits against the Government where \"adequate remedies were already available,\" <i>Kosak, supra,</i> at 858, 104 S.Ct. 1519; see S.Rep. No. 1400, <i>supra,</i> at 33; H.R.Rep. No. 1287, <i>supra,</i> at 6 (setting forth that purpose), a limited exception makes sense; a broad exception does not. Other statutes already provided recovery for plaintiffs harmed by federal officers enforcing customs and tax laws but not for plaintiffs harmed by all other federal officers enforcing most other laws. See <i>Bazuaye v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718189\"><a href=\"/opinion/718189/joromi-h-bazuaye-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 485-486 (C.A.D.C.1996) (detailing history).</p>\n<p>Third, the practical difference between a limited and a broad interpretation is considerable, magnifying the importance of the congressional silence to which Justice KENNEDY points, see <i>ante,</i> at 846-847. A limited interpretation of the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" would likely encompass only those law enforcement officers working, say, at borders and helping to enforce customs and excise laws. The majority instead interprets this provision to include the tens of thousands of officers performing unrelated tasks. The Justice Department estimates that there are more than 100,000 law enforcement officers, not including members of the armed services. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Federal Law Enforcement Officers, 2004, p. 1 (July 2006). And although the law's history contains much that indicates the provision's scope is limited to customs and excise, it contains <i>nothing at all</i> suggesting an intent to apply the provision more broadly, indeed, to multiply the number of officers to whom it applies by what is likely one or more orders of magnitude. It is thus not the Latin canons, <i>ejusdem generis</i> and <i>noscitur a sociis,</i> that shed light on the application of the statutory phrase but Justice SCALIA's more pertinent and easily remembered English-language observation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*852</span> that Congress \"does not ... hide elephants in mouseholes.\" <i>Whitman v.

The Court of Appeals held that the \"detention\" clause was satisfied, and petitioner expressly declined to raise the issue on certiorari. See 204 Fed. Appx. 778, 779-780 (C.A.11 2006) <i>(per curiam);</i> Brief for Petitioner 10-11, n. 9.</p>\n<p>[3]  We consider this question for the first time in this case. Petitioner argues that this Court concluded in <i>Kosak v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111121\"><a href=\"/opinion/111121/kosak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), that the phrase \"any other law enforcement officer\" is ambiguous. Reply Brief for Petitioner 4. In that case, the Court construed a portion of the same clause at issue here, but the decision had no bearing on the meaning of \"any other law enforcement officer.\" 465 U.S., at 853-862, 104 S.Ct. 1519 (holding that \"detention\" encompasses claims resulting from negligent handling or storage). Indeed, the Court expressly declined to reach the issue. <i>Id.,</i> at 852, n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 1519 (\"We have no occasion in this case to decide what kinds of `law-enforcement officer[s],' other than customs officials, are covered by the exception.\" (alteration in original)). Petitioner's reliance on the footnote as concluding that the phrase is ambiguous reads too much into the Court's reservation of a question that was not then before it.</p>\n<p>[4]  Of course, other circumstances may counteract the effect of expansive modifiers. For example, we have construed an \"any\" phrase narrowly when it included a term of art that compelled that result. See <i>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118415\"><a href=\"/opinion/118415/circuit-city-stores-inc-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 115-116, 121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234 (2001) (construing \"any other class of workers engaged in... commerce,\" 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, narrowly based on the Court's previous interpretation of \"in commerce\" as a term of art with a narrower meaning). We also have construed such phrases narrowly when another term in the provision made sense only under a narrow reading, see <i>United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087948\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087948/united-states-v-alvarez-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 357-358, 114 S.Ct. 1599, 128 L.Ed.2d 319 (1994) (limiting \"any law-enforcement officer\" to federal officers because the statute's reference to \"delay\" made sense only with respect to federal officers), and when a broad reading would have implicated sovereignty concerns, see <i>Raygor v. Regents of Univ. of Minn.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></span>, 541-542, 122 S.Ct. 999, 152 L.Ed.2d 27 (2002) (applying the \"clear statement rule\" applicable to waivers of sovereign immunity to construe the phrase \"all civil actions\" to exclude a category of claims, \"even though nothing in the statute expressly exclude[d]\" them). None of the circumstances that motivated our decisions in these cases is present here.</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice KENNEDY'S dissent (hereinafter the dissent) argues that, during border searches, customs and excise officers \"routinely\" enforce civil forfeiture laws unrelated to customs or excise. <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But the examples the dissent provides do not support that assertion. The dissent maintains that a customs officer who seizes material defined as contraband under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 80302 <i>et seq.,</i> is one such example. <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But a customs officer's authority to effect a forfeiture of such contraband derives from a specific customs law. See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1595a(c)(1)(C). Similarly, the dissent suggests that a DEA agent \"assisting a customs official\" in a border search who seizes drug-related contraband under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 is acting in a \"traditional revenue capacity.\" <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But that argument is based on the assumption that an officer who assists in conducting a border search acts in a customs capacity even if he is not a customs officer and is not enforcing a customs law. That assumption, far from self-evident, only underscores the difficulty that would attend any attempt to define the contours of the implied limitation on \u00a7 2680(c)'s reach proposed by petitioner and embraced by the dissent. \"Acting in a customs or excise capacity\" is not a self-defining concept, and not having included such a limitation in the statute's language, Congress of course did not provide a definition. Finally, the dissent points out that a customs or excise officer might effect a forfeiture of currency or monetary instruments under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c). <i>Post,</i> at 847-848. But \u00a7 5317(c) is hardly a civil forfeiture law unrelated to customs or excise. See \u00a7 5317(c)(2) (authorizing forfeiture of property involved in a violation of, <i>inter alia,</i> \u00a7 5316, which sets forth reporting requirements for exporting and importing monetary instruments).</p>\n<p>[6]  As an example of \"other law enforcement officer[s]\" acting in an excise or customs capacity, petitioner cites <i>Formula One Motors, Ltd. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"461212\"><a href=\"/opinion/461212/formula-one-motors-ltd-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span>, 823-824 (C.A.2 1985) (holding that the seizure of a vehicle still in transit from overseas by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents who searched it for drugs was \"sufficiently akin to the functions carried out by Customs officials to place the agents' conduct within the scope of section 2680(c)\"). But it is not clear that the agents in that case were acting in an excise or customs capacity rather than in their ordinary capacity as law enforcement agents. It seems to us that DEA agents searching a car for drugs are acting in their capacity as officers charged with enforcing the Nation's drug laws, not the customs or excise laws.\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, the dissent notes that 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 89(a) authorizes Coast Guard officers to enforce customs laws. <i>Post,</i> at 843-844. But the very next subsection of \u00a7 89 provides that Coast Guard officers effectively <i>are</i> customs officers when they enforce customs laws. See \u00a7 89(b)(1) (providing that Coast Guard officers \"insofar as they are engaged, pursuant to the authority contained in this section, in enforcing any law of the United States shall ... be deemed to be acting as agents of the particular executive department ... charged with the administration of the particular law\"). As a result, a Coast Guard officer enforcing a customs law is a customs officer, not some \"other law enforcement officer.\"</p>\n<p>[7]  Congress, we note, did provide an administrative remedy for lost property claimants like petitioner. Federal agencies have authority under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723(a)(1) to settle certain \"claim[s] for not more than $1,000 for damage to, or loss of, privately owned property that ... is caused by the negligence of an officer or employee of the United States Government acting within the scope of employment.\" The BOP has settled more than 1,100 such claims in the last three years.
