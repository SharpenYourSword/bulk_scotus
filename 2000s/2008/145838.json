Avila, Attorney Department of Justice Washington, D.C., for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented is whether a court must raise on its own the timeliness of a lawsuit filed in the Court of Federal Claims, despite the Government's waiver of the issue. We hold that the special statute of limitations governing the Court of Federal Claims requires that <i>sua sponte</i> consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Company filed an action in the Court of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*753</span> Federal Claims in May 2002. The complaint explained that petitioner held a 50-year mining lease on certain land. And it asserted that various Environmental Protection Agency activities on that land (involving, <i>e.g.,</i> the building and moving of various fences) amounted to an unconstitutional taking of its leasehold rights.</p>\n<p>The Government initially asserted that petitioner's several claims were all untimely in light of the statute providing that \"[e]very claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. Later, however, the Government effectively conceded that certain claims were timely. See App. 37a-39a (Government's pretrial brief). The Government subsequently won on the merits. See 62 Fed.Cl. 556, 589 (2004).</p>\n<p>Petitioner appealed the adverse judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See 457 F.3d 1345, 1346 (2006). The Government's brief said nothing about the statute of limitations, but an <i>amicus</i> brief called the issue to the court's attention. See <i>id.,</i> at 1352. The court considered itself obliged to address the limitations issue, and it held that the action was untimely. <i>Id.,</i> at 1353-1360. We subsequently agreed to consider whether the Court of Appeals was right to ignore the Government's waiver and to decide the timeliness question. 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2877, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Most statutes of limitations seek primarily to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Kubrick,</i> 444 U.S. 111, 117, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979). Thus, the law typically treats a limitations defense as an affirmative defense that the defendant must raise at the pleadings stage and that is subject to rules of forfeiture and waiver. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1), 12(b), 15(a); <i>Day v. McDonough,</i> 547 U.S. 198, 202, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006); <i>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</i> 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982). Such statutes also typically permit courts to toll the limitations period in light of special equitable considerations. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Rotella v. Wood,</i> 528 U.S. 549, 560-561, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000); <i>Zipes, supra,</i> at 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127; see also <i>Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,</i> 920 F.2d 446, 450-453 (C.A.7 1990).</p>\n<p>Some statutes of limitations, however, seek not so much to protect a defendant's case-specific interest in timeliness as to achieve a broader system-related goal, such as facilitating the administration of claims, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brockamp,</i> 519 U.S. 347, 352-353, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997), limiting the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Dalm,</i> 494 U.S. 596, 609-610, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), or promoting judicial efficiency, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bowles v. Russell,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2365-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The Court has often read the time limits of these statutes as more absolute, say as requiring a court to decide a timeliness question despite a waiver, or as forbidding a court to consider whether certain equitable considerations warrant extending a limitations period. See, <i>e.g., ibid.;</i> see also <i>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> 546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). As convenient shorthand, the Court has sometimes referred to the time limits in such statutes as \"jurisdictional.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bowles, supra,</i> at 2364.</p>\n<p>This Court has long interpreted the court of claims limitations statute as setting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*754</span> forth this second, more absolute, kind of limitations period.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Kendall v. United States,</i> 107 U.S. 123, 2 S.Ct. 277, 27 L.Ed. 437 (1883), the Court applied a predecessor of the current 6-year bar to a claim that had first accrued in 1865 but that the plaintiff did not bring until 1872. <i>Id.,</i> at 124, 2 S.Ct. 277; see also Act of Mar. 3, 1863, \u00a7 10, 12 Stat. 767 (Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1069). The plaintiff, a former Confederate States employee, had asked for equitable tolling on the ground that he had not been able to bring the suit until Congress, in 1868, lifted a previously imposed legal disability. See 107 U.S., at 124-125, 2 S.Ct. 277. But the Court denied the request. <i>Id.,</i> at 125-126, 2 S.Ct. 277. It did so not because it thought the equities ran against the plaintiff, but because the statute (with certain listed exceptions) did not permit tolling. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said the statute was \"jurisdiction[al],\" that it was not susceptible to judicial \"engraft[ing]\" of unlisted disabilities such as \"sickness, surprise, or inevitable accident,\" and that \"<i>it [was] the duty of the court to raise the [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Four years later, in <i>Finn v. United States,</i> 123 U.S. 227, 8 S.Ct. 82, 31 L.Ed. 128 (1887), the Court found untimely a claim that had originally been filed with a Government agency, but which that agency had then voluntarily referred by statute to the Court of Claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 229-230, 8 S.Ct. 82 (citing Act of June 25, 1868, \u00a7 7, 15 Stat. 76-77); see also Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1063-1065. That Government reference, it might have been argued, amounted to a waiver by the Government of any limitations-based defense. Cf. <i>United States v. Lippitt,</i> 100 U.S. 663, 669, 15 Ct.Cl. 622, 25 L.Ed. 747 (1880) (reserving the question of the time bar's application in such circumstances). The Court nonetheless held that the long (over 10-year) delay between the time the claim accrued and the plaintiff's filing of the claim before the agency made the suit untimely. <i>Finn,</i> 123 U.S., at 232, 8 S.Ct. 82. And as to any argument of Government waiver or abandonment of the time-bar defense, Justice Harlan, again writing for the Court, said that the ordinary legal principle that \"limitation. . . is a defence [that a defendant] must plead . . . <i>has no application to suits in the Court of Claims against the United States.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 232-233, 8 S.Ct. 82 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Over the years, the Court has reiterated in various contexts this or similar views about the more absolute nature of the court of claims limitations statute. See <i>Soriano v. United States,</i> 352 U.S. 270, 273-274, 77 S.Ct. 269, 1 L.Ed.2d 306 (1957); <i>United States v. Greathouse,</i> 166 U.S. 601, 602, 17 S.Ct. 701, 41 L.Ed. 1130 (1897); <i>United States v. New York,</i> 160 U.S. 598, 616-619, 31 Ct.Cl. 459, 16 S.Ct. 402, 40 L.Ed. 551 (1896); <i>De Arnaud v. United States,</i> 151 U.S. 483, 495-496, 29 Ct.Cl. 555, 14 S.Ct. 374, 38 L.Ed. 244 (1894).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The statute's language has changed slightly since <i>Kendall</i> was decided in 1883, but we do not see how any changes in language make a difference here. The only arguably pertinent linguistic change took place during the 1948 recodification of Title 28. See \u00a7 2501, 62 Stat. 976. Prior to 1948, the statute said that \"[e]very claim. . . <i>cognizable by</i> the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred\" unless filed within six years of the time it first accrues. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1069 (emphasis added); see also Act of Mar. 3, 1911, \u00a7 156, 36 Stat. 1139 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*755</span> (reenacting the statute without any significant changes). Now, it says that \"[e]very claim of which\" the Court of Federal Claims \"<i>has jurisdiction</i> shall be barred\" unless filed within six years of the time it first accrues. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>This Court does not \"presume\" that the 1948 revision \"worked a change in the underlying substantive law `unless an intent to make such a change is clearly expressed.'\" <i>Keene Corp. v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 200, 209, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993) (quoting <i>Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp.,</i> 353 U.S. 222, 227, 77 S.Ct. 787, 1 L.Ed.2d 786 (1957) (alterations omitted)); see also No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1-8 (1947) (hereinafter Rep. No. 308) (revision sought to codify, not substantively modify, existing law); Barron, The Judicial Code: 1948 Revision, 8 F.R.D. 439 (1948) (same). We can find no such expression of intent here. The two linguistic forms (\"cognizable by\"; \"has jurisdiction\") mean about the same thing. See Black's Law Dictionary 991 (4th ed.1951) (defining \"jurisdiction\" as \"the authority by which courts and judicial officers take <i>cognizance of</i> and decide cases\" (emphasis added)); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1038 (3d ed.1933) (similarly using the term \"cognizance\" to define \"jurisdiction\"). Nor have we found any suggestion in the Reviser's Notes or anywhere else that Congress intended to change the prior meaning. See Rep. No. 308, at A192 (Reviser's Note); Barron, <i>supra,</i> at 446 (Reviser's Notes specify where change was intended). Thus, it is not surprising that nearly a decade <i>after</i> the revision, the Court, citing <i>Kendall,</i> again repeated that the statute's limitations period was \"jurisdiction[al]\" and not susceptible to equitable tolling. See <i>Soriano, supra,</i> at 273-274, 277, 77 S.Ct. 269.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In consequence, petitioner can succeed only by convincing us that this Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn, its earlier precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We cannot agree with petitioner that the Court already has overturned the earlier precedent. It is true, as petitioner points out, that in <i>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> 498 U.S. 89, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), we adopted \"a more general rule\" to replace our prior ad hoc approach for determining whether a Government-related statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling\u0097namely, \"that the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453. It is also true that <i>Irwin,</i> using that presumption, found equitable tolling applicable to a statute of limitations governing employment discrimination claims against the Government. See <i>id.,</i> at 96, 111 S.Ct. 453; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1988 ed.). And the Court noted that this civil rights statute was linguistically similar to the court of claims statute at issue here. See <i>Irwin, supra,</i> at 94-95, 111 S.Ct. 453.</p>\n<p>But these few swallows cannot make petitioner's summer. That is because <i>Irwin</i> dealt with a different limitations statute. That statute, while similar to the present statute in language, is unlike the present statute in the key respect that the Court had not previously provided a definitive interpretation. Moreover, the Court, while mentioning a case that reflects the particular interpretive history of the court of claims statute, namely <i>Soriano,</i> 352 U.S. 270, 77 S.Ct. 269, 1 L.Ed.2d 306, says nothing at all about overturning that or any other case in that line. See 498 U.S., <span class=\"star-pagination\">*756</span> at 94-95, 111 S.Ct. 453. Courts do not normally overturn a long line of earlier cases without mentioning the matter. Indeed, <i>Irwin</i> recognized that it was announcing a general prospective rule, see <i>id.,</i> at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, which does not imply revisiting past precedents.</p>\n<p>Finally, <i>Irwin</i> adopted a \"<i>rebuttable</i> presumption\" of equitable tolling. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). That presumption seeks to produce a set of statutory interpretations that will more accurately reflect Congress' likely meaning in the mine run of instances where it enacted a Government-related statute of limitations. But the word \"rebuttable\" means that the presumption is not conclusive. Specific statutory language, for example, could rebut the presumption by demonstrating Congress' intent to the contrary. And if so, a definitive earlier interpretation of the statute, finding a similar congressional intent, should offer a similarly sufficient rebuttal.</p>\n<p>Petitioner adds that in <i>Franconia Associates v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 129, 122 S.Ct. 1993, 153 L.Ed.2d 132 (2002), we explicitly considered the court of claims limitations statute, we described the statute as \"unexceptional,\" and we cited <i>Irwin</i> for the proposition \"that limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties.\" 536 U.S., at 145, 122 S.Ct. 1993 (internal quotation marks omitted). But we did all of this in the context of rejecting an argument by the Government that the court of claims statute embodies a special, earlier-than-normal, rule as to when a claim first accrues. <i>Id.,</i> at 144-145, 122 S.Ct. 1993. The quoted language thus refers only to the statute's claims-accrual rule and adds little or nothing to petitioner's contention that <i>Irwin</i> overruled our earlier cases\u0097a contention that we have just rejected.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner's argument must therefore come down to an invitation now to reject or to overturn <i>Kendall, Finn, Soriano,</i> and related cases. In support, petitioner can claim that <i>Irwin</i> and <i>Franconia</i> represent a turn in the course of the law and can argue essentially as follows: The law now requires courts, when they interpret statutes setting forth limitations periods in respect to actions against the Government, to place greater weight upon the equitable importance of treating the Government like other litigants and less weight upon the special governmental interest in protecting public funds. Cf. <i>Irwin, supra,</i> at 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453. The older interpretations treated these interests differently. Those older cases have consequently become anomalous. The Government is unlikely to have relied significantly upon those earlier cases. Hence the Court should now overrule them.</p>\n<p>Basic principles of <i>stare decisis,</i> however, require us to reject this argument. Any anomaly the old cases and <i>Irwin</i> together create is not critical; at most, it reflects a different judicial assumption about the comparative weight Congress would likely have attached to competing legitimate interests. Moreover, the earlier cases lead, at worst, to different interpretations of different, but similarly worded, statutes; they do not produce \"unworkable\" law. See <i>United States v. International Business Machines Corp.,</i> 517 U.S. 843, 856, 116 S.Ct. 1793, 135 L.Ed.2d 124 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>California v. FERC,</i> 495 U.S. 490, 499, 110 S.Ct. 2024, 109 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990). Further, <i>stare decisis</i> in respect to statutory interpretation has \"special force,\" for \"Congress remains free to alter what we have done.\" <i>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,</i> 491 U.S. 164, 172-173, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989); see also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*757</span> <i>Watson v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 579, 585, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2007). Additionally, Congress has long acquiesced in the interpretation we have given. See <i>ibid.; </i><i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 23, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p>Finally, even if the Government cannot show detrimental reliance on our earlier cases, our reexamination of well-settled precedent could nevertheless prove harmful. Justice Brandeis once observed that \"in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\" <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U.S. 393, 406, 52 S.Ct. 443, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (dissenting opinion). To overturn a decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe that decision is no longer \"right\" would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others. And that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for necessary legal stability. We have not found here any factors that might overcome these considerations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Statutes of limitations generally fall into two broad categories: affirmative defenses that can be waived and so-called \"jurisdictional\" statutes that are not subject to waiver or equitable tolling. For much of our history, statutes of limitations in suits against the Government were customarily placed in the latter category on the theory that conditions attached to a waiver of sovereign immunity \"must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\" <i>Soriano v. United States,</i> 352 U.S. 270, 276, 77 S.Ct. 269, 1 L.Ed.2d 306 (1957); see also <i>Finn</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 123 U.S. 227, 232-233, 8 S.Ct. 82, 31 L.Ed. 128 (1887); <i>Kendall v. United States,</i> 107 U.S. 123, 125-126, 2 S.Ct. 277, 27 L.Ed. 437 (1883). But that rule was ignored\u0097and thus presumably abandoned\u0097in <i>Honda v. Clark,</i> 386 U.S. 484, 87 S.Ct. 1188, 18 L.Ed.2d 244 (1967),<sup>[1]</sup> and <i>Bowen v. City of New York,</i> 476 U.S. 467, 106 S.Ct. 2022, 90 L.Ed.2d 462 (1986).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> 498 U.S. 89, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), we followed the lead of <i>Bowen</i> (and, by extension, <i>Honda</i>), and explicitly replaced the <i>Soriano</i> rule with a rebuttable presumption that equitable tolling rules \"applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States.\"<sup>[3]</sup> We acknowledged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*758</span> that \"our previous cases dealing with the effect of time limits in suits against the Government [had] not been entirely consistent,\" 498 U.S., at 94, 111 S.Ct. 453, and we determined that \"a continuing effort on our part to decide each case on an ad hoc basis . . . would have the disadvantage of continuing unpredictability without the corresponding advantage of greater fidelity to the intent of Congress,\" <i>id.,</i> at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453. We therefore crafted a background rule that reflected \"a realistic assessment of legislative intent,\" and also provided \"a practically useful principle of interpretation.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Irwin</i> did more than merely \"mentio[n]\" <i>Soriano, ante,</i> at 756; rather, we expressly declined to follow that case. We noted that the limitations language at issue in <i>Irwin</i> closely resembled the text we had confronted in <i>Soriano;</i> although we conceded that \"[a]n argument [could] undoubtedly be made\" that the statutes were distinguishable, we were \"not persuaded that the difference between them [was] enough to manifest a different congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling,\" 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453. Having found the two statutes functionally indistinguishable, we nevertheless declined the Government's invitation to follow <i>Soriano,</i> and we did not so much as cite <i>Kendall</i> or <i>Finn.</i> Instead, we adopted \"a more general rule to govern the applicability of equitable tolling in suits against the Government,\" 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, and we applied the new presumption in favor of equitable tolling to the case before us.<sup>[4]</sup> Nothing in the framing of our decision to adopt a \"general rule\" to govern the availability of equitable tolling in suits against the Government, <i>ibid.,</i> suggested a carve-out for statutes we had already held ineligible for equitable tolling, pursuant to the approach that we had previously abandoned in <i>Honda</i> and <i>Bowen,</i> and definitively rejected in <i>Irwin.</i></p>\n<p>Indeed, in his separate opinion in <i>Irwin,</i> Justice White noted that the decision was not only inconsistent with our prior cases but also that it \"directly overrule[d]\" <i>Soriano.</i> 498 U.S., at 98, 111 S.Ct. 453 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Neither the Court's opinion nor my separate opinion disagreed with that characterization of our holding. The attempt of the Court today, therefore, to cast petitioner's argument as an entreaty to overrule <i>Soriano,</i> as well as <i>Kendall</i> and <i>Finn</i>\u0097and its response that \"[b]asic principles of <i>stare decisis</i> . . . require us to reject this argument,\" <i>ante,</i> at 756\u0097has a hollow ring. If the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> supplied a clear answer to the question posed by this case\u0097or if the Government <span class=\"star-pagination\">*759</span> could plausibly argue that it had relied on <i>Soriano</i> after our decision in <i>Irwin</i>\u0097I would join the Court's judgment, despite its unwisdom.<sup>[5]</sup> But I do not agree with the majority's reading of our cases. It seems to me quite plain that <i>Soriano</i> is no longer good law, and if there is in fact ambiguity in our cases, it ought to be resolved in favor of clarifying the law, rather than preserving an anachronism whose doctrinal underpinnings were discarded years ago.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>With respect to provisions as common as time limitations, Congress, in enacting statutes, and judges, in applying them, ought to be able to rely upon a background rule of considerable clarity. <i>Irwin</i> announced such a rule, and I would apply that rule to the case before us.<sup>[7]</sup> Because today's decision threatens to revive the confusion of our pre-<i>Irwin</i> jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree that adhering to <i>Kendall, Finn,</i> and <i>Soriano</i> is irreconcilable with the reasoning and result in <i>Irwin,</i> and therefore join Justice STEVENS' dissent. I write separately to explain why I would regard this case as an appropriate occasion to revisit those precedents even if we had not already \"directly overrule[d]\" them. Cf. <i>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> 498 U.S. 89, 98, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990) (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p><i>Stare decisis</i> is an important, but not an inflexible, doctrine in our law. See <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U.S. 393, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*760</span> 405, 52 S.Ct. 443, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (\"<i>Stare decisis</i> is not . . . a universal, inexorable command.\"). The policies underlying the doctrine\u0097stability and predictability\u0097are at their strongest when the Court is asked to change its mind, though nothing else of significance has changed. See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, 47 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 281, 286-287 (1990). As to the matter before us, our perception of the office of a time limit on suits against the Government has changed significantly since the decisions relied upon by the Court. We have recognized that \"the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States,\" <i>Irwin,</i> 498 U.S., at 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, and that \"limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties,\" <i>Franconia Associates v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 129, 145, 122 S.Ct. 1993, 153 L.Ed.2d 132 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also <i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> 541 U.S. 401, 420-422, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004). It damages the coherence of the law if we cling to outworn precedent at odds with later, more enlightened decisions.</p>\n<p>I surely do not suggest that overruling is routinely in order whenever a majority disagrees with a past decision, and I acknowledge that \"[c]onsiderations of <i>stare decisis</i> have special force in the area of statutory interpretation,\" <i>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,</i> 491 U.S. 164, 172, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). But concerns we have previously found sufficiently weighty to justify revisiting a statutory precedent counsel strongly in favor of doing so here. First, overruling <i>Kendall v. United States,</i> 107 U.S. 123, 2 S.Ct. 277, 27 L.Ed. 437 (1883), <i>Finn v. United States,</i> 123 U.S. 227, 8 S.Ct. 82, 31 L.Ed. 128 (1887), and <i>Soriano v. United States,</i> 352 U.S. 270, 77 S.Ct. 269, 1 L.Ed.2d 306 (1957), would, as the Court concedes, see <i>ante,</i> at 756, \"achieve a uniform interpretation of similar statutory language,\" <i>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,</i> 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989). Second, we have recognized the propriety of revisiting a decision when \"intervening development of the law\" has \"removed or weakened [its] conceptual underpinnings.\" <i>Patterson,</i> 491 U.S., at 173, 109 S.Ct. 2363. <i>Irwin</i> and <i>Franconia</i>\u0097not to mention our recent efforts to apply the term \"jurisdictional\" with greater precision, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> 546 U.S. 500, 515-516, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006)\u0097have left no tenable basis for <i>Kendall</i> and its progeny.</p>\n<p>Third, it is altogether appropriate to overrule a precedent that has become \"a positive detriment to coherence and consistency in the law.\" <i>Patterson,</i> 491 U.S., at 173, 109 S.Ct. 2363. The inconsistency between the <i>Kendall</i> line and <i>Irwin</i> is a source of both theoretical incoherence and practical confusion. For example, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) contains a time limit materially identical to the one in \u00a7 2501. Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether \u00a7 2401(a)'s limit is \"jurisdictional.\" Compare <i>Center for Biological Diversity v. Hamilton,</i> 453 F.3d 1331, 1334 (C.A.11 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> with <i>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. Shalala,</i> 125 F.3d 765, 770 (C.A.9 1997). See also <i>Harris v. Federal Aviation Admin.,</i> 353 F.3d 1006, 1013, n. 7 (C.A.D.C.2004) (recognizing that <i>Irwin</i> may have undermined Circuit precedent holding that \u00a7 2401(a) is \"jurisdictional\"). Today's decision hardly assists lower courts endeavoring to answer this question. While holding that the language in \u00a7 2501 is \"jurisdictional,\" the Court also implies that <i>Irwin</i> governs the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*761</span> interpretation of all statutes we have not yet construed\u0097including, presumably, the identically worded \u00a7 2401. See <i>ante,</i> at 756.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the Court implicitly concedes, see <i>ante,</i> at 756-757, the strongest reason to adhere to precedent provides no support for the <i>Kendall-Finn-Soriano</i> line. \"<i>Stare decisis</i> has added force when the legislature, in the public sphere, and citizens, in the private realm, have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.\" <i>Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n,</i> 502 U.S. 197, 202, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991). The Government, however, makes no claim that either private citizens or Congress have relied upon the \"jurisdictional\" status of \u00a7 2501. There are thus strong reasons to abandon\u0097and notably slim reasons to adhere to\u0097the anachronistic interpretation of \u00a7 2501 adopted in <i>Kendall.</i></p>\n<p>Several times, in recent Terms, the Court has discarded statutory decisions rendered infirm by what a majority considered to be better informed opinion. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2705, 2725, 168 L.Ed.2d 623 (2007) (overruling <i>Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.,</i> 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502 (1911)); <i>Bowles v. Russell,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366-67, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (overruling <i>Thompson v.

Cherry Meat Packers, Inc.,</i> 371 U.S. 215, 83 S.Ct. 283, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1962) <i>(per curiam)</i>); <i>Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc.,</i> 547 U.S. 28, 42-43, 126 S.Ct. 1281, 164 L.Ed.2d 26 (2006) (overruling, <i>inter alia, </i><i>Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.,</i> 314 U.S. 488, 62 S.Ct. 402, 86 L.Ed. 363 (1942)); <i>Hohn v. United States,</i> 524 U.S. 236, 253, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998) (overruling <i>House v. Mayo,</i> 324 U.S. 42, 65 S.Ct. 517, 89 L.Ed. 739 (1945) <i>(per curiam)</i>). In light of these overrulings, the Court's decision to adhere to <i>Kendall, Finn,</i> and <i>Soriano</i>\u0097 while offering nothing to justify their reasoning or results\u0097is, to say the least, perplexing. After today's decision, one will need a crystal ball to predict when this Court will reject, and when it will cling to, its prior decisions interpreting legislative texts.</p>\n<p>I would reverse the judgment rendered by the Federal Circuit majority. In accord with dissenting Judge Newman, I would hold that the Court of Appeals had no warrant to declare the petitioner's action time barred.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In <i>Honda,</i> we concluded, as to petitioners' attempts to recover assets that had been seized upon the outbreak of hostilities with Japan, that it was \"consistent with the overall congressional purpose to apply a traditional equitable tolling principle, aptly suited to the particular facts of this case and nowhere eschewed by Congress.\" 386 U.S., at 501, 87 S.Ct. 1188.</p>\n<p>[2]  In <i>Bowen,</i> we permitted equitable tolling of the 60-day requirement for challenging the denial of disability benefits under the Social Security Act. We cautioned that \"we must be careful not to assume the authority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended, or construe the waiver unduly restrictively.\" 476 U.S., at 479, 106 S.Ct. 2022 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[3]  During the <i>Irwin</i> oral arguments, several Members of the Court remarked on the need to choose between the <i>Soriano</i> line of cases and the approach taken in cases like <i>Bowen.</i> See Tr. of Oral Arg., O.T.1990, No. 89-5867, pp. 25-26 (\"Question: `[W]hat do you make of our cases which seem to go really in different directions. The <i>Bowen</i> case, which was unanimous and contains language in it that says statutory time limits are traditionally subject to equitable tolling, and other cases like maybe <i>Soriano</i> . . . which point in the other direction[?]'\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 8 (\"Question: `. . . I think we sort of have to choose between <i>Soriano</i> and <i>Bowen,</i> don't you think?'\").</p>\n<p>[4]  In the years since we decided <i>Irwin,</i> we have applied its rule in a number of statutory contexts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> 541 U.S. 401, 420-423, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (applying the rule of <i>Irwin</i> and finding that an application for fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), should be permitted to be amended out of time). Most significantly, in <i>Franconia Associates v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 129, 145, 122 S.Ct. 1993, 153 L.Ed.2d 132 (2002), we affirmed, in the context of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, the rule that \"limitations principles should generally apply to the Government `in the same way that' they apply to private parties\" (citing <i>Irwin,</i> 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453). Although the Government is correct that the question presented by <i>Franconia</i> was when a claim accrued under \u00a7 2501, our reliance on <i>Irwin</i> undermines the majority's suggestion that <i>Irwin</i> has no bearing on statutes that have previously been the subject of judicial construction.</p>\n<p>[5]  The majority points out quite rightly, <i>ante,</i> at 756, that the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> has \"`special force'\" in statutory cases. See <i>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,</i> 491 U.S. 164, 172-173, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). But the doctrine should not prevent us from acknowledging when we have already overruled a prior case, even if we failed to say so explicitly at the time. In <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> 542 U.S. 466, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004), for example, we explained that in <i>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</i> 410 U.S. 484, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973), we had overruled so much of <i>Ahrens v. Clark,</i> 335 U.S. 188, 68 S.Ct. 1443, 92 L.Ed. 1898 (1948), as found that the habeas petitioners' presence within the territorial reach of the district court was a jurisdictional prerequisite. <i>Braden</i> held, contrary to <i>Ahrens,</i> that a prisoner's presence within the district court's territorial reach was <i>not</i> an \"inflexible jurisdictional rule,\" 410 U.S., at 500, 93 S.Ct. 1123. <i>Braden</i> nowhere stated that it was overruling <i>Ahrens,</i> although Justice Rehnquist began his dissent by noting: \"Today the Court overrules <i>Ahrens v. Clark.</i>\" 410 U.S., at 502, 93 S.Ct. 1123. Thirty years later we acknowledged in <i>Rasul</i> what was by then clear: <i>Ahrens</i> was no longer good law. 542 U.S., at 478-479, and n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 2686.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, the logic of the \"special force\" of <i>stare decisis</i> in the statutory context is that \"Congress remains free to alter what we have done,\" <i>Patterson,</i> 491 U.S., at 172-173, 109 S.Ct. 2363. But the amendment of an obscure statutory provision is not a high priority for a busy Congress, and we should remain mindful that enactment of legislation is by no means a cost-free enterprise.</p>\n<p>[6]  See Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L.Rev. 457, 469 (1897) (\"It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past\").</p>\n<p>[7]  The majority does gesture toward an application of <i>Irwin,</i> contending that even if <i>Irwin's</i> rule is apposite, the presumption of congressional intent to allow equitable tolling is rebutted by this Court's \"definitive earlier interpretation\" of \u00a7 2501, <i>ante,</i> at 756. But the majority's application of the <i>Irwin</i> rule is implausible, since <i>Irwin</i> itself compared the language of \u00a7 2501 with the limitations language of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and found that the comparison did <i>not</i> reveal \"a different congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling,\" 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued November 6, 2007\u2014Decided January 8, 2008\nIn a Court of Federal Claims action, petitioner argued that various fed\n  eral activities on land for which it held a mining lease amounted to\n  an unconstitutional taking of its leasehold rights. The Government\n  initially asserted that the claims were untimely under the court of\n  claims statute of limitations, but later effectively conceded that issue\n  and won on the merits. Although the Government did not raise time\n  liness on appeal, the Federal Circuit addressed the issue sua sponte,\n  finding the action untimely.\nHeld: The court of claims statute of limitations requires sua sponte con\n sideration of a lawsuit\u2019s timeliness, despite the Government\u2019s waiver\n of the issue. Pp. 2\u20139.\n    (a) This Court has long interpreted the statute as setting out a\n more absolute, \u201cjurisdictional\u201d limitations period. For example, in\n 1883, the Court concluded with regard to the current statute\u2019s prede\n cessor that \u201cit [was] the duty of the court to raise the [timeliness]\n question whether it [was] done by plea or not.\u201d Kendall v.

While the Irwin Court noted the similarity of that\n statute to the court of claims statute, the civil rights statute is unlike\n2          JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    the present statute in the key respect that the Court had not previ\n    ously provided a definitive interpretation. Moreover, the Irwin Court\n    mentioned Soriano, which reflects the particular interpretive history\n    of the court of claims statute, but said nothing about overturning it or\n    any other case in that line. Finally, just as an equitable tolling pre\n    sumption could be rebutted by statutory language demonstrating\n    Congress\u2019 contrary intent, it should be rebutted by a definitive earlier\n    interpretation finding a similar congressional intent. Language in\n    Franconia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145, describing\n    the court of claims statute as \u201cunexceptional\u201d and citing Irwin for the\n    proposition \u201cthat limitations principles should generally apply to the\n    Government in the same way that they apply to private parties\u201d re\n    fers only to the statute\u2019s claims-accrual rule and adds little or noth\n    ing to petitioner\u2019s contention that Irwin overruled earlier cases.\n    Pp. 6\u20137.\n         (2) Stare decisis principles require rejection of petitioner\u2019s argu\n    ment that the Court should overturn Kendall, Finn, Soriano, and re\n    lated cases. Any anomaly such old cases and Irwin together create is\n    not critical, but simply reflects a different judicial assumption about\n    the comparative weight Congress would likely have attached to com\n    peting national interests. Moreover, the earlier cases do not produce\n    \u201cunworkable\u201d law, see, e.g., United States v. International Business\n    Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 856.

Finally, even if the Government cannot show detri\n    mental reliance on the earlier cases, reexamination of well-settled\n    precedent could nevertheless prove harmful. Overturning a decision\n    on the belief that it is no longer \u201cright\u201d would inevitably reflect a will\n    ingness to reconsider others, and such willingness could itself\n    threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for nec\n    essary legal stability.

We hold that the special statute of limitations\ngoverning the Court of Federal Claims requires that\nsua sponte consideration.\n                             I\n  Petitioner John R. Sand & Gravel Company filed an\naction in the Court of Federal Claims in May 2002. The\ncomplaint explained that petitioner held a 50-year mining\nlease on certain land. And it asserted that various Envi\nronmental Protection Agency activities on that land (in\nvolving, e.g., the building and moving of various fences)\namounted to an unconstitutional taking of its leasehold\nrights.\n  The Government initially asserted that petitioner\u2019s\nseveral claims were all untimely in light of the statute\nproviding that \u201c[e]very claim of which the United States\nCourt of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred\nunless the petition thereon is filed within six years after\n2      JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuch claim first accrues.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72501. Later, how\never, the Government effectively conceded that certain\nclaims were timely. See App. 37a\u201339a (Government\u2019s\npretrial brief). The Government subsequently won on the\nmerits. See 62 Fed. Cl. 556, 589 (2004).\n  Petitioner appealed the adverse judgment to the Court\nof Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See 457 F. 3d 1345,\n1346 (2006). The Government\u2019s brief said nothing about\nthe statute of limitations, but an amicus brief called the\nissue to the court\u2019s attention. See id., at 1352. The court\nconsidered itself obliged to address the limitations issue,\nand it held that the action was untimely. Id., at 1353\u2013\n1360. We subsequently agreed to consider whether the\nCourt of Appeals was right to ignore the Government\u2019s\nwaiver and to decide the timeliness question. 550 U. S.\n___ (2007).\n                             II\n   Most statutes of limitations seek primarily to protect\ndefendants against stale or unduly delayed claims. See,\ne.g., United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117 (1979).\nThus, the law typically treats a limitations defense as an\naffirmative defense that the defendant must raise at the\npleadings stage and that is subject to rules of forfeiture\nand waiver. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1), 12(b), 15(a);\nDay v. McDonough, 547 U. S. 198, 202 (2006); Zipes v.\nTrans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393 (1982).\nSuch statutes also typically permit courts to toll the limi\ntations period in light of special equitable considerations.\nSee, e.g., Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 560\u2013561 (2000);\nZipes, supra, at 393; see also Cada v. Baxter Healthcare\nCorp., 920 F. 2d 446, 450\u2013453 (CA7 1990).\n   Some statutes of limitations, however, seek not so much\nto protect a defendant's case-specific interest in timeliness\nas to achieve a broader system-related goal, such as facili\ntating the administration of claims, see, e.g., United States\n                  Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Brockamp, 519 U. S. 347, 352\u2013353 (1997), limiting the\nscope of a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity,\nsee, e.g., United States v. Dalm, 494 U. S. 596, 609\u2013610\n(1990), or promoting judicial efficiency, see, e.g., Bowles v.\nRussell, 551 U. S. ___ , ___\u2013___ (2007) (slip op., at 7\u20138).\nThe Court has often read the time limits of these statutes\nas more absolute, say as requiring a court to decide a\ntimeliness question despite a waiver, or as forbidding a\ncourt to consider whether certain equitable considerations\nwarrant extending a limitations period. See, e.g., ibid.; see\nalso Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006).\nAs convenient shorthand, the Court has sometimes re\nferred to the time limits in such statutes as \u201cjurisdic\ntional.\u201d See, e.g., Bowles, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5).\n   This Court has long interpreted the court of claims\nlimitations statute as setting forth this second, more\nabsolute, kind of limitations period.\n                             A\n   In Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S. 123 (1883), the\nCourt applied a predecessor of the current 6-year bar to a\nclaim that had first accrued in 1865 but that the plaintiff\ndid not bring until 1872. Id., at 124; see also Act of Mar.\n3, 1863, \u00a710, 12 Stat. 767 (Rev. Stat. \u00a71069). The plaintiff,\na former Confederate States employee, had asked for\nequitable tolling on the ground that he had not been able\nto bring the suit until Congress, in 1868, lifted a previ\nously imposed legal disability. See 107 U. S., at 124\u2013125.\nBut the Court denied the request. Id., at 125\u2013126. It did\nso not because it thought the equities ran against the\nplaintiff, but because the statute (with certain listed ex\nceptions) did not permit tolling. Justice Harlan, writing\nfor the Court, said the statute was \u201cjurisdiction[al],\u201d that\nit was not susceptible to judicial \u201cengraft[ing]\u201d of unlisted\ndisabilities such as \u201csickness, surprise, or inevitable acci\ndent,\u201d and that \u201cit [was] the duty of the court to raise the\n4      JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not.\u201d\nIbid. (emphasis added).\n   Four years later, in Finn v. United States, 123 U. S. 227\n(1887), the Court found untimely a claim that had origi\nnally been filed with a Government agency, but which that\nagency had then voluntarily referred by statute to the\nCourt of Claims. Id., at 229\u2013230 (citing Act of June 25,\n1868, \u00a77, 15 Stat. 76\u201377); see also Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a71063\u20131065.\nThat Government reference, it might have been argued,\namounted to a waiver by the Government of any limita\ntions-based defense. Cf. United States v. Lippitt, 100 U. S.\n663, 669 (1880) (reserving the question of the time bar\u2019s\napplication in such circumstances). The Court nonethe\nless held that the long (over 10-year) delay between the\ntime the claim accrued and the plaintiff\u2019s filing of the\nclaim before the agency made the suit untimely. Finn, 123\nU. S., at 232. And as to any argument of Government\nwaiver or abandonment of the time-bar defense, Justice\nHarlan, again writing for the Court, said that the ordinary\nlegal principle that \u201climitation . . . is a defence [that a\ndefendant] must plead . . . has no application to suits in\nthe Court of Claims against the United States.\u201d Id. at 232\u2013\n233 (emphasis added).\n   Over the years, the Court has reiterated in various\ncontexts this or similar views about the more absolute\nnature of the court of claims limitations statute. See\nSoriano v. United States, 352 U. S. 270, 273\u2013274 (1957);\nUnited States v. Greathouse, 166 U. S. 601, 602 (1897);\nUnited States v. New York, 160 U. S. 598, 616\u2013619 (1896);\nDe Arnaud v. United States, 151 U. S. 483, 495\u2013496\n(1894).\n                           B\n  The statute\u2019s language has changed slightly since Kend\nall was decided in 1883, but we do not see how any\nchanges in language make a difference here.

See \u00a72501, 62 Stat. 976.\nPrior to 1948, the statute said that \u201c[e]very claim . . .\ncognizable by the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred\u201d\nunless filed within six years of the time it first accrues.\nRev. Stat. \u00a71069 (emphasis added); see also Act of Mar. 3,\n1911, \u00a7156, 36 Stat. 1139 (reenacting the statute without\nany significant changes). Now, it says that \u201c[e]very claim\nof which\u201d the Court of Federal Claims \u201chas jurisdiction\nshall be barred\u201d unless filed within six years of the time it\nfirst accrues. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72501 (emphasis added).\n   This Court does not \u201cpresume\u201d that the 1948 revision\n\u201cworked a change in the underlying substantive law\n\u2018unless an intent to make such a change is clearly ex\npressed.\u2019 \u201d Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S. 200, 209\n(1993) (quoting Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products\nCorp., 353 U. S. 222, 227 (1957) (alterations omitted)); see\nalso No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 1\u20138 (1947) (herein\nafter Rep. No. 308) (revision sought to codify, not substan\ntively modify, existing law); Barron, The Judicial Code:\n1948 Revision, 8 F. R. D. 439 (1948) (same). We can find\nno such expression of intent here. The two linguistic\nforms (\u201ccognizable by\u201d; \u201chas jurisdiction\u201d) mean about the\nsame thing. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 991 (4th ed. 1951)\n(defining \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as \u201cthe authority by which courts\nand judicial officers take cognizance of and decide cases\u201d\n(emphasis added)); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1038\n(3d ed. 1933) (similarly using the term \u201ccognizance\u201d to\ndefine \u201cjurisdiction\u201d). Nor have we found any suggestion\nin the Reviser\u2019s Notes or anywhere else that Congress\nintended to change the prior meaning. See Rep. No. 308,\nat A192 (Reviser\u2019s Note); Barron, supra, at 446 (Reviser\u2019s\nNotes specify where change was intended). Thus, it is not\nsurprising that nearly a decade after the revision, the\nCourt, citing Kendall, again repeated that the statute\u2019s\nlimitations period was \u201cjurisdiction[al]\u201d and not suscepti\n6      JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nble to equitable tolling. See Soriano, supra, at 273\u2013274,\n277.\n                             III\n  In consequence, petitioner can succeed only by convinc\ning us that this Court has overturned, or that it should\nnow overturn, its earlier precedent.\n                               A\n   We cannot agree with petitioner that the Court already\nhas overturned the earlier precedent. It is true, as peti\ntioner points out, that in Irwin v. Department of Veterans\nAffairs, 498 U. S. 89 (1990), we adopted \u201ca more general\nrule\u201d to replace our prior ad hoc approach for determining\nwhether a Government-related statute of limitations is\nsubject to equitable tolling\u2014namely, \u201cthat the same rebut\ntable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits\nagainst private defendants should also apply to suits\nagainst the United States.\u201d Id., at 95\u201396. It is also true\nthat Irwin, using that presumption, found equitable toll\ning applicable to a statute of limitations governing em\nployment discrimination claims against the Government.\nSee id., at 96; see also 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u201316(c) (1988 ed.).\nAnd the Court noted that this civil rights statute was\nlinguistically similar to the court of claims statute at issue\nhere. See Irwin, supra, at 94\u201395.\n   But these few swallows cannot make petitioner\u2019s sum\nmer. That is because Irwin dealt with a different limita\ntions statute. That statute, while similar to the present\nstatute in language, is unlike the present statute in the\nkey respect that the Court had not previously provided a\ndefinitive interpretation. Moreover, the Court, while\nmentioning a case that reflects the particular interpretive\nhistory of the court of claims statute, namely Soriano, 352\nU. S. 270, says nothing at all about overturning that or\nany other case in that line. See 498 U. S., at 94\u201395.\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourts do not normally overturn a long line of earlier\ncases without mentioning the matter. Indeed, Irwin\nrecognized that it was announcing a general prospective\nrule, see id., at 95, which does not imply revisiting past\nprecedents.\n   Finally, Irwin adopted a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d of\nequitable tolling. Ibid. (emphasis added). That presump\ntion seeks to produce a set of statutory interpretations\nthat will more accurately reflect Congress\u2019 likely meaning\nin the mine run of instances where it enacted a Govern\nment-related statute of limitations. But the word \u201crebut\ntable\u201d means that the presumption is not conclusive.\nSpecific statutory language, for example, could rebut the\npresumption by demonstrating Congress\u2019 intent to the\ncontrary. And if so, a definitive earlier interpretation of\nthe statute, finding a similar congressional intent, should\noffer a similarly sufficient rebuttal.\n   Petitioner adds that in Franconia Associates v. United\nStates, 536 U. S. 129 (2002), we explicitly considered the\ncourt of claims limitations statute, we described the stat\nute as \u201cunexceptional,\u201d and we cited Irwin for the proposi\ntion \u201cthat limitations principles should generally apply to\nthe Government in the same way that they apply to pri\nvate parties.\u201d 536 U. S., at 145 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But we did all of this in the context of rejecting\nan argument by the Government that the court of claims\nstatute embodies a special, earlier-than-normal, rule as to\nwhen a claim first accrues. Id., at 144\u2013145. The quoted\nlanguage thus refers only to the statute\u2019s claims-accrual\nrule and adds little or nothing to petitioner\u2019s contention\nthat Irwin overruled our earlier cases\u2014a contention that\nwe have just rejected.\n                           B\n  Petitioner\u2019s argument must therefore come down to an\ninvitation now to reject or to overturn Kendall, Finn,\n8      JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSoriano, and related cases. In support, petitioner can\nclaim that Irwin and Franconia represent a turn in the\ncourse of the law and can argue essentially as follows:\nThe law now requires courts, when they interpret statutes\nsetting forth limitations periods in respect to actions\nagainst the Government, to place greater weight upon the\nequitable importance of treating the Government like\nother litigants and less weight upon the special govern\nmental interest in protecting public funds. Cf. Irwin,\nsupra, at 95\u201396. The older interpretations treated these\ninterests differently. Those older cases have consequently\nbecome anomalous. The Government is unlikely to have\nrelied significantly upon those earlier cases. Hence the\nCourt should now overrule them.\n  Basic principles of stare decisis, however, require us to\nreject this argument. Any anomaly the old cases and\nIrwin together create is not critical; at most, it reflects a\ndifferent judicial assumption about the comparative\nweight Congress would likely have attached to competing\nlegitimate interests. Moreover, the earlier cases lead, at\nworst, to different interpretations of different, but simi\nlarly worded, statutes; they do not produce \u201cunworkable\u201d\nlaw. See United States v. International Business Machines\nCorp., 517 U. S. 843, 856 (1996) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); California v. FERC, 495 U. S. 490, 499 (1990).\nFurther, stare decisis in respect to statutory interpretation\nhas \u201cspecial force,\u201d for \u201cCongress remains free to alter\nwhat we have done.\u201d Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,\n491 U. S. 164, 172\u2013173 (1989); see also Watson v. United\nStates, ante, at 8. Additionally, Congress has long acqui\nesced in the interpretation we have given. See ibid.;\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 23 (2005).\n  Finally, even if the Government cannot show detrimen\ntal reliance on our earlier cases, our reexamination of\nwell-settled precedent could nevertheless prove harmful.\nJustice Brandeis once observed that \u201cin most matters it is\n                 Cite as: 552 U.

For much of our history, stat\nutes of limitations in suits against the Government were\ncustomarily placed in the latter category on the theory\nthat conditions attached to a waiver of sovereign immu\nnity \u201cmust be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are\nnot to be implied.\u201d Soriano v. United States, 352 U. S.\n270, 276 (1957); see also Finn v. United States, 123 U. S.\n227, 232\u2013233 (1887); Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S.\n123, 125\u2013126 (1883). But that rule was ignored\u2014and thus\npresumably abandoned\u2014in Honda v. Clark, 386 U. S. 484\n(1967),1 and Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U.

S. 89,\n95\u201396 (1990), we followed the lead of Bowen (and, by\nextension, Honda), and explicitly replaced the Soriano\nrule with a rebuttable presumption that equitable tolling\nrules \u201capplicable to suits against private defendants\nshould also apply to suits against the United States.\u201d3 We\nacknowledged that \u201cour previous cases dealing with the\neffect of time limits in suits against the Government [had]\nnot been entirely consistent,\u201d 498 U.

S., at 95. Having found the two statutes function\nally indistinguishable, we nevertheless declined the Gov\nernment\u2019s invitation to follow Soriano, and we did not so\nmuch as cite Kendall or Finn. Instead, we adopted \u201ca\nmore general rule to govern the applicability of equitable\ntolling in suits against the Government,\u201d 498 U. S., at 95,\nand we applied the new presumption in favor of equitable\ntolling to the case before us.4 Nothing in the framing of\nour decision to adopt a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d to govern the avail\nability of equitable tolling in suits against the Govern\nment, ibid., suggested a carve-out for statutes we had\nalready held ineligible for equitable tolling, pursuant to\nthe approach that we had previously abandoned in Honda\nand Bowen, and definitively rejected in Irwin.\n  Indeed, in his separate opinion in Irwin, Justice White\nnoted that that the decision was not only inconsistent with\nour prior cases but also that it \u201cdirectly overrule[d]\u201d Sori\nano. 498 U. S., at 98 (opinion concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). Neither the Court\u2019s opinion nor\nmy separate opinion disagreed with that characterization\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In the years since we decided Irwin, we have applied its rule in a\nnumber of statutory contexts. See, e.g., Scarborough v. Principi, 541\nU. S. 401, 420\u2013423 (2004) (applying the rule of Irwin and finding that\nan application for fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72412(d)(1)(A), should be permitted to be amended out of time).\nMost significantly, in Franconia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S.\n129, 145 (2002), we affirmed, in the context of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72501, the\nrule that \u201climitations principles should generally apply to the Govern\nment \u2018in the same way that\u2019 they apply to private parties\u201d (citing Irwin,\n498 U. S., at 95). Although the Government is correct that the question\npresented by Franconia was when a claim accrued under \u00a72501, our\nreliance on Irwin undermines the majority\u2019s suggestion that Irwin has\nno bearing on statutes that have previously been the subject of judicial\nconstruction.\n4        JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof our holding. The attempt of the Court today, therefore,\nto cast petitioner\u2019s argument as an entreaty to overrule\nSoriano, as well as Kendall and Finn\u2014and its response\nthat \u201c[b]asic principles of stare decisis . . . require us to\nreject this argument,\u201d ante, at 8\u2014has a hollow ring. If the\ndoctrine of stare decisis supplied a clear answer to the\nquestion posed by this case\u2014or if the Government could\nplausibly argue that it had relied on Soriano after our\ndecision in Irwin\u2014I would join the Court\u2019s judgment,\ndespite its unwisdom.5 But I do not agree with the major\nity\u2019s reading of our cases. It seems to me quite plain that\nSoriano is no longer good law, and if there is in fact ambi\nguity in our cases, it ought to be resolved in favor of clari\nfying the law, rather than preserving an anachronism\nwhose doctrinal underpinnings were discarded years ago.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority points out quite rightly, ante, at 8, that the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis has \u201c \u2018special force\u2019 \u201d in statutory cases. See Patterson v.\nMcLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172\u2013173 (1989). But the doctrine\nshould not prevent us from acknowledging when we have already\noverruled a prior case, even if we failed to say so explicitly at the time.\nIn Rasul v. Bush, 542 U. S. 466 (2004), for example, we explained that\nin Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484 (1973), we\nhad overruled so much of Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188 (1948), as\nfound that the habeas petitioners\u2019 presence within the territorial reach\nof the district court was a jurisdictional prerequisite. Braden held,\ncontrary to Ahrens, that a prisoner\u2019s presence within the district court\u2019s\nterritorial reach was not an \u201cinflexible jurisdictional rule,\u201d 410 U. S., at\n500. Braden nowhere stated that it was overruling Ahrens, although\nJustice Rehnquist began his dissent by noting: \u201cToday the Court\noverrules Ahrens v. Clark.\u201d 410 U. S., at 502. Thirty years later we\nacknowledged in Rasul what was by then clear: Ahrens was no longer\ngood law. 542 U. S., at 478\u2013479, and n. 9.\n  Moreover, the logic of the \u201cspecial force\u201d of stare decisis in the statu\ntory context is that \u201cCongress remains free to alter what we have done,\u201d\nPatterson, 491 U. S., at 172\u2013173. But the amendment of an obscure\nstatutory provision is not a high priority for a busy Congress, and we\nshould remain mindful that enactment of legislation is by no means a\ncost-free enterprise.\n  6 See Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897)\n                      Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)                      5\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   With respect to provisions as common as time limita\ntions, Congress, in enacting statutes, and judges, in apply\ning them, ought to be able to rely upon a background rule\nof considerable clarity. Irwin announced such a rule, and\nI would apply that rule to the case before us.7 Because\ntoday\u2019s decision threatens to revive the confusion of our\npre-Irwin jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(\u201cIt is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it\nwas laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the\ngrounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the\nrule simply persists from blind imitation of the past\u201d).\n   7 The majority does gesture toward an application of Irwin, contend\n\ning that even if Irwin\u2019s rule is apposite, the presumption of congres\nsional intent to allow equitable tolling is rebutted by this Court\u2019s\n\u201cdefinitive earlier interpretation\u201d of \u00a72501, ante, at 7. But the major\nity\u2019s application of the Irwin rule is implausible, since Irwin itself\ncompared the language of \u00a72501 with the limitations language of Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and found that the comparison did\nnot reveal \u201ca different congressional intent with respect to the availabil\nity of equitable tolling,\u201d 498 U.

I write sepa\nrately to explain why I would regard this case as an ap\npropriate occasion to revisit those precedents even if we\nhad not already \u201cdirectly overrule[d]\u201d them. Cf. Irwin\nv. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 98\n(1990) (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment).\n   Stare decisis is an important, but not an inflexible,\ndoctrine in our law. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas\nCo., 285 U. S. 393, 405 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cStare decisis is not . . . a universal, inexorable com\nmand.\u201d). The policies underlying the doctrine\u2014stability\nand predictability\u2014are at their strongest when the Court\nis asked to change its mind, though nothing else of signifi\ncance has changed. See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial\nRestraint, 47 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 281, 286\u2013287 (1990).\nAs to the matter before us, our perception of the office of a\ntime limit on suits against the Government has changed\nsignificantly since the decisions relied upon by the Court.\nWe have recognized that \u201cthe same rebuttable presump\ntion of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private\ndefendants should also apply to suits against the United\n2      JOHN R. SAND & GRAVEL CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nStates,\u201d Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95\u201396, and that \u201climitations\nprinciples should generally apply to the Government in\nthe same way that they apply to private parties,\u201d Franco\nnia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145 (2002)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). See also Scarborough\nv. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 420\u2013422 (2004). It damages the\ncoherence of the law if we cling to outworn precedent at\nodds with later, more enlightened decisions.\n   I surely do not suggest that overruling is routinely in\norder whenever a majority disagrees with a past decision,\nand I acknowledge that \u201c[c]onsiderations of stare decisis\nhave special force in the area of statutory interpretation,\u201d\nPatterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172\n(1989). But concerns we have previously found sufficiently\nweighty to justify revisiting a statutory precedent counsel\nstrongly in favor of doing so here. First, overruling Kend\nall v. United States, 107 U. S. 123 (1883), Finn v. United\nStates, 123 U. S. 227 (1887), and Soriano v. United States,\n352 U. S. 270 (1957), would, as the Court concedes, see\nante, at 8, \u201cachieve a uniform interpretation of similar\nstatutory language,\u201d Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shear-\nson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989).\nSecond, we have recognized the propriety of revisiting a\ndecision when \u201cintervening development of the law\u201d has\n\u201cremoved or weakened [its] conceptual underpinnings.\u201d\nPatterson, 491 U. S., at 173. Irwin and Franconia\u2014not to\nmention our recent efforts to apply the term \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d with greater precision, see, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H\nCorp., 546 U. S. 500, 515\u2013516 (2006)\u2014have left no tenable\nbasis for Kendall and its progeny.\n   Third, it is altogether appropriate to overrule a prece\ndent that has become \u201ca positive detriment to coherence\nand consistency in the law.\u201d Patterson, 491 U. S., at 173.\nThe inconsistency between the Kendall line and Irwin is a\nsource of both theoretical incoherence and practical confu\nsion. For example, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72401(a) contains a time\n                 Cite as: 552 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nlimit materially identical to the one in \u00a72501. Courts of\nAppeals have divided on the question whether \u00a72401(a)\u2019s\nlimit is \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Compare Center for Biological\nDiversity v. Hamilton, 453 F. 3d 1331, 1334 (CA11 2006)\n(per curiam), with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v. Sha\nlala, 125 F. 3d 765, 770 (CA9 1997). See also Harris v.\nFederal Aviation Admin., 353 F. 3d 1006, 1013, n. 7\n(CADC 2004) (recognizing that Irwin may have under\nmined Circuit precedent holding that \u00a72401(a) is \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d). Today\u2019s decision hardly assists lower courts\nendeavoring to answer this question. While holding that\nthe language in \u00a72501 is \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d the Court also\nimplies that Irwin governs the interpretation of all stat\nutes we have not yet construed\u2014including, presumably,\nthe identically worded \u00a72401. See ante, at 7.\n   Moreover, as the Court implicitly concedes, see ante, at\n8, the strongest reason to adhere to precedent provides no\nsupport for the Kendall-Finn-Soriano line. \u201cStare decisis\nhas added force when the legislature, in the public sphere,\nand citizens, in the private realm, have acted in reliance\non a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the\ndecision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or\nrequire an extensive legislative response.\u201d Hilton v. South\nCarolina Public Railways Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 197, 202\n(1991). The Government, however, makes no claim that\neither private citizens or Congress have relied upon the\n\u201cjurisdictional\u201d status of \u00a72501. There are thus strong\nreasons to abandon\u2014and notably slim reasons to adhere\nto\u2014the anachronistic interpretation of \u00a72501 adopted in\nKendall.\n   Several times, in recent Terms, the Court has discarded\nstatutory decisions rendered infirm by what a majority\nconsidered to be better informed opinion. See, e.g., Leegin\nCreative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S.\n___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 28) (overruling Dr. Miles Medi\ncal Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.

S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 9)\n(overruling Thompson v. INS, 375 U. S. 384 (1964) (per\ncuriam), and Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat\nPackers, Inc., 371 U. S. 215 (1962) (per curiam)); Illinois\nTool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U. S. 28, 42\u2013\n43 (2006) (overruling, inter alia, Morton Salt Co. v. G. S.\nSuppiger Co., 314 U.

In light of these overrulings,\nthe Court\u2019s decision to adhere to Kendall, Finn, and Sori\nano\u2014while offering nothing to justify their reasoning or\nresults\u2014is, to say the least, perplexing. After today\u2019s\ndecision, one will need a crystal ball to predict when this\nCourt will reject, and when it will cling to, its prior deci\nsions interpreting legislative texts.\n  I would reverse the judgment rendered by the Federal\nCircuit majority. In accord with dissenting Judge New\nman, I would hold that the Court of Appeals had no war\nrant to declare the petitioner\u2019s action time barred.\n",

We hold that the special statute of limitations governing the Court of Federal Claims requires that <i>sua sponte</i> consideration.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Company filed an action in the Court of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*753</span> Federal Claims in May 2002. The complaint explained that petitioner held a 50-year mining lease on certain land. And it asserted that various Environmental Protection Agency activities on that land (involving, <i>e.g.,</i> the building and moving of various fences) amounted to an unconstitutional taking of its leasehold rights.</p>\n<p>The Government initially asserted that petitioner's several claims were all untimely in light of the statute providing that \"[e]very claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. Later, however, the Government effectively conceded that certain claims were timely. See App. 37a-39a (Government's pretrial brief). The Government subsequently won on the merits. See 62 Fed.Cl. 556, 589 (2004).</p>\n<p>Petitioner appealed the adverse judgment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1345</span></span>, 1346 (2006). The Government's brief said nothing about the statute of limitations, but an <i>amicus</i> brief called the issue to the court's attention. See <i>id.,</i> at 1352. The court considered itself obliged to address the limitations issue, and it held that the action was untimely. <i>Id.,</i> at 1353-1360. We subsequently agreed to consider whether the Court of Appeals was right to ignore the Government's waiver and to decide the timeliness question. 550 U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2877, 167 L.Ed.2d 1151 (2007).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Most statutes of limitations seek primarily to protect defendants against stale or unduly delayed claims. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Kubrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110159\"><a href=\"/opinion/110159/united-states-v-kubrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span>, 117, 100 S.Ct. 352, 62 L.Ed.2d 259 (1979). Thus, the law typically treats a limitations defense as an affirmative defense that the defendant must raise at the pleadings stage and that is subject to rules of forfeiture and waiver. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1), 12(b), 15(a); <i>Day v. McDonough,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145664\"><a href=\"/opinion/145664/day-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span>, 202, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006); <i>Zipes v.

Such statutes also typically permit courts to toll the limitations period in light of special equitable considerations. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Rotella v. Wood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118341\"><a href=\"/opinion/118341/rotella-v-wood/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span>, 560-561, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000); <i>Zipes, supra,</i> at 393, 102 S.Ct. 1127; see also <i>Cada v.

Brockamp,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118083\"><a href=\"/opinion/118083/united-states-v-brockamp/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 352-353, 117 S.Ct. 849, 136 L.Ed.2d 818 (1997), limiting the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. Dalm,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112395\"><a href=\"/opinion/112395/united-states-v-dalm/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 609-610, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), or promoting judicial efficiency, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bowles v. Russell,</i> 551 U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2365-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The Court has often read the time limits of these statutes as more absolute, say as requiring a court to decide a timeliness question despite a waiver, or as forbidding a court to consider whether certain equitable considerations warrant extending a limitations period. See, <i>e.g., ibid.;</i> see also <i>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145677\"><a href=\"/opinion/145677/arbaugh-v-y-h-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006). As convenient shorthand, the Court has sometimes referred to the time limits in such statutes as \"jurisdictional.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bowles, supra,</i> at 2364.</p>\n<p>This Court has long interpreted the court of claims limitations statute as setting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*754</span> forth this second, more absolute, kind of limitations period.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>In <i>Kendall v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90750\"><a href=\"/opinion/90750/kendall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, 2 S.Ct. 277, 27 L.Ed. 437 (1883), the Court applied a predecessor of the current 6-year bar to a claim that had first accrued in 1865 but that the plaintiff did not bring until 1872. <i>Id.,</i> at 124, 2 S.Ct. 277; see also Act of Mar. 3, 1863, \u00a7 10, 12 Stat. 767 (Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1069). The plaintiff, a former Confederate States employee, had asked for equitable tolling on the ground that he had not been able to bring the suit until Congress, in 1868, lifted a previously imposed legal disability. See 107 U.S., at 124-125, 2 S.Ct. 277. But the Court denied the request. <i>Id.,</i> at 125-126, 2 S.Ct. 277. It did so not because it thought the equities ran against the plaintiff, but because the statute (with certain listed exceptions) did not permit tolling. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said the statute was \"jurisdiction[al],\" that it was not susceptible to judicial \"engraft[ing]\" of unlisted disabilities such as \"sickness, surprise, or inevitable accident,\" and that \"<i>it [was] the duty of the court to raise the [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not.</i>\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Four years later, in <i>Finn v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92038\"><a href=\"/opinion/92038/finn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 8 S.Ct. 82, 31 L.Ed. 128 (1887), the Court found untimely a claim that had originally been filed with a Government agency, but which that agency had then voluntarily referred by statute to the Court of Claims. <i>Id.,</i> at 229-230, 8 S.Ct. 82 (citing Act of June 25, 1868, \u00a7 7, 15 Stat. 76-77); see also Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1063-1065. That Government reference, it might have been argued, amounted to a waiver by the Government of any limitations-based defense. Cf. <i>United States v. Lippitt,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90074\"><a href=\"/opinion/90074/united-states-v-lippitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span>, 669, 15 Ct.Cl. 622, 25 L.Ed. 747 (1880) (reserving the question of the time bar's application in such circumstances). The Court nonetheless held that the long (over 10-year) delay between the time the claim accrued and the plaintiff's filing of the claim before the agency made the suit untimely. <i>Finn,</i> 123 U.S., at 232, 8 S.Ct. 82. And as to any argument of Government waiver or abandonment of the time-bar defense, Justice Harlan, again writing for the Court, said that the ordinary legal principle that \"limitation. . . is a defence [that a defendant] must plead . . . <i>has no application to suits in the Court of Claims against the United States.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 232-233, 8 S.Ct. 82 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>Over the years, the Court has reiterated in various contexts this or similar views about the more absolute nature of the court of claims limitations statute.

The only arguably pertinent linguistic change took place during the 1948 recodification of Title 28. See \u00a7 2501, 62 Stat. 976. Prior to 1948, the statute said that \"[e]very claim. . . <i>cognizable by</i> the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred\" unless filed within six years of the time it first accrues. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1069 (emphasis added); see also Act of Mar. 3, 1911, \u00a7 156, 36 Stat. 1139 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*755</span> (reenacting the statute without any significant changes). Now, it says that \"[e]very claim of which\" the Court of Federal Claims \"<i>has jurisdiction</i> shall be barred\" unless filed within six years of the time it first accrues. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>This Court does not \"presume\" that the 1948 revision \"worked a change in the underlying substantive law `unless an intent to make such a change is clearly expressed.'\" <i>Keene Corp. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112865\"><a href=\"/opinion/112865/keene-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 209, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993) (quoting <i>Fourco Glass Co. v.

We can find no such expression of intent here. The two linguistic forms (\"cognizable by\"; \"has jurisdiction\") mean about the same thing. See Black's Law Dictionary 991 (4th ed.1951) (defining \"jurisdiction\" as \"the authority by which courts and judicial officers take <i>cognizance of</i> and decide cases\" (emphasis added)); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1038 (3d ed.1933) (similarly using the term \"cognizance\" to define \"jurisdiction\"). Nor have we found any suggestion in the Reviser's Notes or anywhere else that Congress intended to change the prior meaning. See Rep. No. 308, at A192 (Reviser's Note); Barron, <i>supra,</i> at 446 (Reviser's Notes specify where change was intended). Thus, it is not surprising that nearly a decade <i>after</i> the revision, the Court, citing <i>Kendall,</i> again repeated that the statute's limitations period was \"jurisdiction[al]\" and not susceptible to equitable tolling. See <i>Soriano, supra,</i> at 273-274, 277, 77 S.Ct. 269.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In consequence, petitioner can succeed only by convincing us that this Court has overturned, or that it should now overturn, its earlier precedent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We cannot agree with petitioner that the Court already has overturned the earlier precedent. It is true, as petitioner points out, that in <i>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), we adopted \"a more general rule\" to replace our prior ad hoc approach for determining whether a Government-related statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling\u0097namely, \"that the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453. It is also true that <i>Irwin,</i> using that presumption, found equitable tolling applicable to a statute of limitations governing employment discrimination claims against the Government. See <i>id.,</i> at 96, 111 S.Ct. 453; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (1988 ed.). And the Court noted that this civil rights statute was linguistically similar to the court of claims statute at issue here. See <i>Irwin, supra,</i> at 94-95, 111 S.Ct. 453.</p>\n<p>But these few swallows cannot make petitioner's summer. That is because <i>Irwin</i> dealt with a different limitations statute. That statute, while similar to the present statute in language, is unlike the present statute in the key respect that the Court had not previously provided a definitive interpretation. Moreover, the Court, while mentioning a case that reflects the particular interpretive history of the court of claims statute, namely <i>Soriano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105442\"><a href=\"/opinion/105442/soriano-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 77 S.Ct. 269, 1 L.Ed.2d 306, says nothing at all about overturning that or any other case in that line. See 498 U.S., <span class=\"star-pagination\">*756</span> at 94-95, 111 S.Ct. 453. Courts do not normally overturn a long line of earlier cases without mentioning the matter. Indeed, <i>Irwin</i> recognized that it was announcing a general prospective rule, see <i>id.,</i> at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, which does not imply revisiting past precedents.</p>\n<p>Finally, <i>Irwin</i> adopted a \"<i>rebuttable</i> presumption\" of equitable tolling. <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). That presumption seeks to produce a set of statutory interpretations that will more accurately reflect Congress' likely meaning in the mine run of instances where it enacted a Government-related statute of limitations. But the word \"rebuttable\" means that the presumption is not conclusive. Specific statutory language, for example, could rebut the presumption by demonstrating Congress' intent to the contrary. And if so, a definitive earlier interpretation of the statute, finding a similar congressional intent, should offer a similarly sufficient rebuttal.</p>\n<p>Petitioner adds that in <i>Franconia Associates v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121150\"><a href=\"/opinion/121150/franconia-associates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 122 S.Ct. 1993, 153 L.Ed.2d 132 (2002), we explicitly considered the court of claims limitations statute, we described the statute as \"unexceptional,\" and we cited <i>Irwin</i> for the proposition \"that limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties.\" 536 U.S., at 145, 122 S.Ct. 1993 (internal quotation marks omitted). But we did all of this in the context of rejecting an argument by the Government that the court of claims statute embodies a special, earlier-than-normal, rule as to when a claim first accrues. <i>Id.,</i> at 144-145, 122 S.Ct. 1993. The quoted language thus refers only to the statute's claims-accrual rule and adds little or nothing to petitioner's contention that <i>Irwin</i> overruled our earlier cases\u0097a contention that we have just rejected.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Petitioner's argument must therefore come down to an invitation now to reject or to overturn <i>Kendall, Finn, Soriano,</i> and related cases. In support, petitioner can claim that <i>Irwin</i> and <i>Franconia</i> represent a turn in the course of the law and can argue essentially as follows: The law now requires courts, when they interpret statutes setting forth limitations periods in respect to actions against the Government, to place greater weight upon the equitable importance of treating the Government like other litigants and less weight upon the special governmental interest in protecting public funds. Cf. <i>Irwin, supra,</i> at 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453. The older interpretations treated these interests differently. Those older cases have consequently become anomalous. The Government is unlikely to have relied significantly upon those earlier cases. Hence the Court should now overrule them.</p>\n<p>Basic principles of <i>stare decisis,</i> however, require us to reject this argument. Any anomaly the old cases and <i>Irwin</i> together create is not critical; at most, it reflects a different judicial assumption about the comparative weight Congress would likely have attached to competing legitimate interests. Moreover, the earlier cases lead, at worst, to different interpretations of different, but similarly worded, statutes; they do not produce \"unworkable\" law. See <i>United States v. International Business Machines Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118038\"><a href=\"/opinion/118038/united-states-v-international-business-machines-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span>, 856, 116 S.Ct. 1793, 135 L.Ed.2d 124 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>California v. FERC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112431\"><a href=\"/opinion/112431/california-v-ferc/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 499, 110 S.Ct. 2024, 109 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990). Further, <i>stare decisis</i> in respect to statutory interpretation has \"special force,\" for \"Congress remains free to alter what we have done.\" <i>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112296\"><a href=\"/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 172-173, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989); see also <span class=\"star-pagination\">*757</span> <i>Watson v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 579, 585, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2007). Additionally, Congress has long acquiesced in the interpretation we have given. See <i>ibid.; </i><i>Shepard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 23, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p>Finally, even if the Government cannot show detrimental reliance on our earlier cases, our reexamination of well-settled precedent could nevertheless prove harmful. Justice Brandeis once observed that \"in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\" <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101894\"><a href=\"/opinion/101894/burnet-v-coronado-oil-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 406, 52 S.Ct. 443, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (dissenting opinion). To overturn a decision settling one such matter simply because we might believe that decision is no longer \"right\" would inevitably reflect a willingness to reconsider others. And that willingness could itself threaten to substitute disruption, confusion, and uncertainty for necessary legal stability. We have not found here any factors that might overcome these considerations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice GINSBURG joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Statutes of limitations generally fall into two broad categories: affirmative defenses that can be waived and so-called \"jurisdictional\" statutes that are not subject to waiver or equitable tolling. For much of our history, statutes of limitations in suits against the Government were customarily placed in the latter category on the theory that conditions attached to a waiver of sovereign immunity \"must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\" <i>Soriano v.

Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990), we followed the lead of <i>Bowen</i> (and, by extension, <i>Honda</i>), and explicitly replaced the <i>Soriano</i> rule with a rebuttable presumption that equitable tolling rules \"applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States.\"<sup>[3]</sup> We acknowledged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*758</span> that \"our previous cases dealing with the effect of time limits in suits against the Government [had] not been entirely consistent,\" 498 U.S., at 94, 111 S.Ct. 453, and we determined that \"a continuing effort on our part to decide each case on an ad hoc basis . . . would have the disadvantage of continuing unpredictability without the corresponding advantage of greater fidelity to the intent of Congress,\" <i>id.,</i> at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453. We therefore crafted a background rule that reflected \"a realistic assessment of legislative intent,\" and also provided \"a practically useful principle of interpretation.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Irwin</i> did more than merely \"mentio[n]\" <i>Soriano, ante,</i> at 756; rather, we expressly declined to follow that case. We noted that the limitations language at issue in <i>Irwin</i> closely resembled the text we had confronted in <i>Soriano;</i> although we conceded that \"[a]n argument [could] undoubtedly be made\" that the statutes were distinguishable, we were \"not persuaded that the difference between them [was] enough to manifest a different congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling,\" 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453. Having found the two statutes functionally indistinguishable, we nevertheless declined the Government's invitation to follow <i>Soriano,</i> and we did not so much as cite <i>Kendall</i> or <i>Finn.</i> Instead, we adopted \"a more general rule to govern the applicability of equitable tolling in suits against the Government,\" 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, and we applied the new presumption in favor of equitable tolling to the case before us.<sup>[4]</sup> Nothing in the framing of our decision to adopt a \"general rule\" to govern the availability of equitable tolling in suits against the Government, <i>ibid.,</i> suggested a carve-out for statutes we had already held ineligible for equitable tolling, pursuant to the approach that we had previously abandoned in <i>Honda</i> and <i>Bowen,</i> and definitively rejected in <i>Irwin.</i></p>\n<p>Indeed, in his separate opinion in <i>Irwin,</i> Justice White noted that the decision was not only inconsistent with our prior cases but also that it \"directly overrule[d]\" <i>Soriano.</i> 498 U.S., at 98, 111 S.Ct. 453 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Neither the Court's opinion nor my separate opinion disagreed with that characterization of our holding. The attempt of the Court today, therefore, to cast petitioner's argument as an entreaty to overrule <i>Soriano,</i> as well as <i>Kendall</i> and <i>Finn</i>\u0097and its response that \"[b]asic principles of <i>stare decisis</i> . . . require us to reject this argument,\" <i>ante,</i> at 756\u0097has a hollow ring. If the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> supplied a clear answer to the question posed by this case\u0097or if the Government <span class=\"star-pagination\">*759</span> could plausibly argue that it had relied on <i>Soriano</i> after our decision in <i>Irwin</i>\u0097I would join the Court's judgment, despite its unwisdom.<sup>[5]</sup> But I do not agree with the majority's reading of our cases. It seems to me quite plain that <i>Soriano</i> is no longer good law, and if there is in fact ambiguity in our cases, it ought to be resolved in favor of clarifying the law, rather than preserving an anachronism whose doctrinal underpinnings were discarded years ago.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>With respect to provisions as common as time limitations, Congress, in enacting statutes, and judges, in applying them, ought to be able to rely upon a background rule of considerable clarity. <i>Irwin</i> announced such a rule, and I would apply that rule to the case before us.<sup>[7]</sup> Because today's decision threatens to revive the confusion of our pre-<i>Irwin</i> jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree that adhering to <i>Kendall, Finn,</i> and <i>Soriano</i> is irreconcilable with the reasoning and result in <i>Irwin,</i> and therefore join Justice STEVENS' dissent. I write separately to explain why I would regard this case as an appropriate occasion to revisit those precedents even if we had not already \"directly overrule[d]\" them. Cf. <i>Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span>, 98, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990) (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p><i>Stare decisis</i> is an important, but not an inflexible, doctrine in our law. See <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101894\"><a href=\"/opinion/101894/burnet-v-coronado-oil-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*760</span> 405, 52 S.Ct. 443, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (\"<i>Stare decisis</i> is not . . . a universal, inexorable command.\"). The policies underlying the doctrine\u0097stability and predictability\u0097are at their strongest when the Court is asked to change its mind, though nothing else of significance has changed. See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, 47 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 281, 286-287 (1990). As to the matter before us, our perception of the office of a time limit on suits against the Government has changed significantly since the decisions relied upon by the Court. We have recognized that \"the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States,\" <i>Irwin,</i> 498 U.S., at 95-96, 111 S.Ct. 453, and that \"limitations principles should generally apply to the Government in the same way that they apply to private parties,\" <i>Franconia Associates v.

It damages the coherence of the law if we cling to outworn precedent at odds with later, more enlightened decisions.</p>\n<p>I surely do not suggest that overruling is routinely in order whenever a majority disagrees with a past decision, and I acknowledge that \"[c]onsiderations of <i>stare decisis</i> have special force in the area of statutory interpretation,\" <i>Patterson v.

But concerns we have previously found sufficiently weighty to justify revisiting a statutory precedent counsel strongly in favor of doing so here. First, overruling <i>Kendall v.

Second, we have recognized the propriety of revisiting a decision when \"intervening development of the law\" has \"removed or weakened [its] conceptual underpinnings.\" <i>Patterson,</i> 491 U.S., at 173, 109 S.Ct. 2363. <i>Irwin</i> and <i>Franconia</i>\u0097not to mention our recent efforts to apply the term \"jurisdictional\" with greater precision, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Arbaugh v.

The inconsistency between the <i>Kendall</i> line and <i>Irwin</i> is a source of both theoretical incoherence and practical confusion. For example, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) contains a time limit materially identical to the one in \u00a7 2501. Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether \u00a7 2401(a)'s limit is \"jurisdictional.\" Compare <i>Center for Biological Diversity v. Hamilton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77342\"><a href=\"/opinion/77342/center-for-biological-diversity-v-sam-hamilton/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1334 (C.A.11 2006) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>,</i> with <i>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center v.

Today's decision hardly assists lower courts endeavoring to answer this question. While holding that the language in \u00a7 2501 is \"jurisdictional,\" the Court also implies that <i>Irwin</i> governs the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*761</span> interpretation of all statutes we have not yet construed\u0097including, presumably, the identically worded \u00a7 2401. See <i>ante,</i> at 756.</p>\n<p>Moreover, as the Court implicitly concedes, see <i>ante,</i> at 756-757, the strongest reason to adhere to precedent provides no support for the <i>Kendall-Finn-Soriano</i> line. \"<i>Stare decisis</i> has added force when the legislature, in the public sphere, and citizens, in the private realm, have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.\" <i>Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112669\"><a href=\"/opinion/112669/hilton-v-south-carolina-public-railways-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 202, 112 S.Ct. 560, 116 L.Ed.2d 560 (1991). The Government, however, makes no claim that either private citizens or Congress have relied upon the \"jurisdictional\" status of \u00a7 2501. There are thus strong reasons to abandon\u0097and notably slim reasons to adhere to\u0097the anachronistic interpretation of \u00a7 2501 adopted in <i>Kendall.</i></p>\n<p>Several times, in recent Terms, the Court has discarded statutory decisions rendered infirm by what a majority considered to be better informed opinion.

In light of these overrulings, the Court's decision to adhere to <i>Kendall, Finn,</i> and <i>Soriano</i>\u0097 while offering nothing to justify their reasoning or results\u0097is, to say the least, perplexing. After today's decision, one will need a crystal ball to predict when this Court will reject, and when it will cling to, its prior decisions interpreting legislative texts.</p>\n<p>I would reverse the judgment rendered by the Federal Circuit majority. In accord with dissenting Judge Newman, I would hold that the Court of Appeals had no warrant to declare the petitioner's action time barred.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In <i>Honda,</i> we concluded, as to petitioners' attempts to recover assets that had been seized upon the outbreak of hostilities with Japan, that it was \"consistent with the overall congressional purpose to apply a traditional equitable tolling principle, aptly suited to the particular facts of this case and nowhere eschewed by Congress.\" 386 U.S., at 501, 87 S.Ct. 1188.</p>\n<p>[2]  In <i>Bowen,</i> we permitted equitable tolling of the 60-day requirement for challenging the denial of disability benefits under the Social Security Act. We cautioned that \"we must be careful not to assume the authority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended, or construe the waiver unduly restrictively.\" 476 U.S., at 479, 106 S.Ct. 2022 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>[3]  During the <i>Irwin</i> oral arguments, several Members of the Court remarked on the need to choose between the <i>Soriano</i> line of cases and the approach taken in cases like <i>Bowen.</i> See Tr. of Oral Arg., O.T.1990, No. 89-5867, pp. 25-26 (\"Question: `[W]hat do you make of our cases which seem to go really in different directions. The <i>Bowen</i> case, which was unanimous and contains language in it that says statutory time limits are traditionally subject to equitable tolling, and other cases like maybe <i>Soriano</i> . . . which point in the other direction[?]'\"); see also <i>id.,</i> at 8 (\"Question: `. . . I think we sort of have to choose between <i>Soriano</i> and <i>Bowen,</i> don't you think?'\").</p>\n<p>[4]  In the years since we decided <i>Irwin,</i> we have applied its rule in a number of statutory contexts. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Scarborough v. Principi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134738\"><a href=\"/opinion/134738/scarborough-v-principi/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 420-423, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (applying the rule of <i>Irwin</i> and finding that an application for fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), should be permitted to be amended out of time). Most significantly, in <i>Franconia Associates v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121150\"><a href=\"/opinion/121150/franconia-associates-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span>, 145, 122 S.Ct. 1993, 153 L.Ed.2d 132 (2002), we affirmed, in the context of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501, the rule that \"limitations principles should generally apply to the Government `in the same way that' they apply to private parties\" (citing <i>Irwin,</i> 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453). Although the Government is correct that the question presented by <i>Franconia</i> was when a claim accrued under \u00a7 2501, our reliance on <i>Irwin</i> undermines the majority's suggestion that <i>Irwin</i> has no bearing on statutes that have previously been the subject of judicial construction.</p>\n<p>[5]  The majority points out quite rightly, <i>ante,</i> at 756, that the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> has \"`special force'\" in statutory cases. See <i>Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112296\"><a href=\"/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 172-173, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). But the doctrine should not prevent us from acknowledging when we have already overruled a prior case, even if we failed to say so explicitly at the time. In <i>Rasul v. Bush,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137000\"><a href=\"/opinion/137000/rasul-v-bush/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 2686, 159 L.Ed.2d 548 (2004), for example, we explained that in <i>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108730\"><a href=\"/opinion/108730/braden-v-30th-judicial-circuit-court-of-ky/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973), we had overruled so much of <i>Ahrens v. Clark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104590\"><a href=\"/opinion/104590/ahrens-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 68 S.Ct. 1443, 92 L.Ed. 1898 (1948), as found that the habeas petitioners' presence within the territorial reach of the district court was a jurisdictional prerequisite. <i>Braden</i> held, contrary to <i>Ahrens,</i> that a prisoner's presence within the district court's territorial reach was <i>not</i> an \"inflexible jurisdictional rule,\" 410 U.S., at 500, 93 S.Ct. 1123. <i>Braden</i> nowhere stated that it was overruling <i>Ahrens,</i> although Justice Rehnquist began his dissent by noting: \"Today the Court overrules <i>Ahrens v. Clark.</i>\" 410 U.S., at 502, 93 S.Ct. 1123. Thirty years later we acknowledged in <i>Rasul</i> what was by then clear: <i>Ahrens</i> was no longer good law. 542 U.S., at 478-479, and n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 2686.\n</p>\n<p>Moreover, the logic of the \"special force\" of <i>stare decisis</i> in the statutory context is that \"Congress remains free to alter what we have done,\" <i>Patterson,</i> 491 U.S., at 172-173, 109 S.Ct. 2363. But the amendment of an obscure statutory provision is not a high priority for a busy Congress, and we should remain mindful that enactment of legislation is by no means a cost-free enterprise.</p>\n<p>[6]  See Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L.Rev. 457, 469 (1897) (\"It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past\").</p>\n<p>[7]  The majority does gesture toward an application of <i>Irwin,</i> contending that even if <i>Irwin's</i> rule is apposite, the presumption of congressional intent to allow equitable tolling is rebutted by this Court's \"definitive earlier interpretation\" of \u00a7 2501, <i>ante,</i> at 756. But the majority's application of the <i>Irwin</i> rule is implausible, since <i>Irwin</i> itself compared the language of \u00a7 2501 with the limitations language of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and found that the comparison did <i>not</i> reveal \"a different congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling,\" 498 U.S., at 95, 111 S.Ct. 453.</p>\n\n</div>",
