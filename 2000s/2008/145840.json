MAXWELL HOFFMAN\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 07\u2013110.   Decided January 7, 2008 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Maxwell Hoffman was convicted of first-\ndegree murder and sentenced to death. See State v. Hoff\nman, 123 Idaho 638, 851 P. 2d 934 (1993). Hoffman\nsought federal habeas relief on the grounds that, inter\nalia, his counsel had been ineffective during both pretrial\nplea bargaining and the sentencing phase of his trial. The\nDistrict Court, finding that Hoffman had received ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel during sentencing but not during\nplea bargaining, granted Hoffman\u2019s federal habeas peti\ntion in part and ordered the State of Idaho to resentence\nhim. Civ. Action No. 94\u20130200\u2013S\u2013BLW (Mar. 30, 2002),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 65. The Ninth Circuit Court of\nAppeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision regarding\nineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing,* but\nreversed with respect to the ineffective assistance claim\nduring plea negotiations. 455 F. 3d 926, 942 (2006). The\nNinth Circuit thus granted the writ, ordering the District\nCourt to direct the State either to release Hoffman or to\n\u201coffe[r] [him] a plea agreement with the \u2018same material\nterms\u2019 offered in the original plea agreement.\u201d Id., at 943.\nThe State sought, and we granted, certiorari. 552 U.

The State, however, subsequently withdrew that cross-\nappeal, leaving in place the District Court\u2019s order granting habeas\nrelief as to Hoffman\u2019s death sentence. 455 F. 3d 926, 931 (CA9 2006).\n2                   ARAVE v. HOFFMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   Hoffman now abandons his claim that counsel was\nineffective during plea bargaining. See Respondent\u2019s\nMotion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause\nas Moot. He \u201cno longer seeks or desires the relief ordered\nby the Court of Appeals with respect to the plea offer.\u201d Id.,\nat 3. Rather, Hoffman now \u201cwishes to withdraw his claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with plea\nbargaining\u201d and asks this Court to dismiss his appeal with\nprejudice on that issue so that he may proceed with the\nresentencing ordered by the District Court. Ibid.\n   The State, in its response, notes that Hoffman\u2019s re\nquested relief is \u201cvirtually identical to the request made by\nthe state in its Petition for Certiorari.\u201d Response to Re\nspondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss\nthe Cause as Moot, p. 3. The State therefore agrees that\nthe instant motion to vacate and dismiss with prejudice\nmoots Hoffman\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nduring plea negotiations and asks that the motion be\ngranted.\n   We grant respondent\u2019s motion. Because his claim for\nineffective assistance of counsel during pretrial plea bar\ngaining is moot, we vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals to the extent that it addressed that claim. The\ncase is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit with directions that it instruct the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Idaho to\ndismiss the relevant claim with prejudice.
