Hoffman\nsought federal habeas relief on the grounds that, inter\nalia, his counsel had been ineffective during both pretrial\nplea bargaining and the sentencing phase of his trial. The\nDistrict Court, finding that Hoffman had received ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel during sentencing but not during\nplea bargaining, granted Hoffman’s federal habeas peti\ntion in part and ordered the State of Idaho to resentence\nhim. Civ. Action No. 94–0200–S–BLW (Mar. 30, 2002),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 38, 65. The Ninth Circuit Court of\nAppeals affirmed the District Court’s decision regarding\nineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing,* but\nreversed with respect to the ineffective assistance claim\nduring plea negotiations. 455 F. 3d 926, 942 (2006). The\nNinth Circuit thus granted the writ, ordering the District\nCourt to direct the State either to release Hoffman or to\n“offe[r] [him] a plea agreement with the ‘same material\nterms’ offered in the original plea agreement.” Id., at 943.\nThe State sought, and we granted, certiorari. 552 U. S.\n___ (2007).\n\n——————\n  * The State initially cross-appealed the District Court’s grant of\nHoffman’s habeas petition for ineffective assistance of counsel at\nsentencing. The State, however, subsequently withdrew that cross-\nappeal, leaving in place the District Court’s order granting habeas\nrelief as to Hoffman’s death sentence. 455 F. 3d 926, 931 (CA9 2006).\n2                   ARAVE v. HOFFMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   Hoffman now abandons his claim that counsel was\nineffective during plea bargaining. See Respondent’s\nMotion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss the Cause\nas Moot. He “no longer seeks or desires the relief ordered\nby the Court of Appeals with respect to the plea offer.” Id.,\nat 3. Rather, Hoffman now “wishes to withdraw his claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with plea\nbargaining” and asks this Court to dismiss his appeal with\nprejudice on that issue so that he may proceed with the\nresentencing ordered by the District Court. Ibid.\n   The State, in its response, notes that Hoffman’s re\nquested relief is “virtually identical to the request made by\nthe state in its Petition for Certiorari.” Response to Re\nspondent’s Motion to Vacate Decision Below and Dismiss\nthe Cause as Moot, p. 3. The State therefore agrees that\nthe instant motion to vacate and dismiss with prejudice\nmoots Hoffman’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nduring plea negotiations and asks that the motion be\ngranted.\n   We grant respondent’s motion. Because his claim for\nineffective assistance of counsel during pretrial plea bar\ngaining is moot, we vacate the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals to the extent that it addressed that claim. The\ncase is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit with directions that it instruct the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Idaho to\ndismiss the relevant claim with prejudice.
