GOOD ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 07–562.      Argued October 6, 2008—Decided December 15, 2008\nRespondents, smokers of petitioners’ “light” cigarettes, filed suit, alleg\n  ing that petitioners violated the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act\n  (MUTPA) by fraudulently advertising that their “light” cigarettes de\n  livered less tar and nicotine than regular brands. The District Court\n  granted summary judgment for petitioners, finding the state-law\n  claim pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising\n  Act (Labeling Act). The First Circuit reversed, holding that the La\n  beling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empts respondents’\n  fraud claim.\nHeld: Neither the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provision nor the Federal\n Trade Commission’s actions in this field pre-empt respondents’ state\n law fraud claim. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Congress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a statute’s\n express language or through its structure and purpose. See Jones v.\n Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525. When the text of an express\n pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading,\n courts ordinarily “accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption.”\n Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449. The Labeling\n Act’s stated purposes are to inform the public of the health risks of\n smoking while protecting commerce and the economy from the ill ef\n fects of nonuniform requirements to the extent consistent with the\n first goal. Although fidelity to these purposes does not demand the\n pre-emption of state fraud rules, the principal question here is\n whether that result is nevertheless required by 15 U. S. C. §1334(b),\n which provides that “[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smok\n ing and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the\n advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are\n labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.” Pp. 5–9.\n2                    ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (b) Respondents’ claim is not expressly pre-empted by §1334(b). As\n    determined in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, and\n    Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, the phrase “based on\n    smoking and health” modifies the state-law rule at issue rather than\n    a particular application of that rule. The Cipollone plurality con\n    cluded that “the phrase ‘based on smoking and health’ fairly but nar\n    rowly construed” did not pre-empt the Cipollone plaintiff’s common\n    law claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently misrepre\n    sented and concealed a material fact, because the claim alleged a vio\n    lation of a duty not to deceive—a duty that is not “based on” smoking\n    and health. 505 U. S., at 528–529. Respondents here also allege a\n    violation of the duty not to deceive as codified in the MUTPA, which,\n    like the common-law duty in Cipollone, has nothing to do with smok\n    ing and health. Respondents’ claim is not analogous to the “warning\n    neutralization” claim found to be pre-empted in Cipollone. Reilly is\n    consistent with Cipollone’s analysis. This Court disagrees with peti\n    tioners’ alternative argument that the express pre-emption frame\n    work of Cipollone and Reilly should be rejected. American Airlines,\n    Inc. v.

Specifically, they allege that\npetitioners’ advertising fraudulently conveyed the mes\nsage that their “light” cigarettes deliver less tar and nico\ntine to consumers than regular brands despite petitioners’\nknowledge that the message was untrue. Petitioners deny\nthe charge, asserting that their advertisements were\nfactually accurate. The merits of the dispute are not\nbefore us because the District Court entered summary\njudgment in favor of petitioners on the ground that re\nspondents’ state-law claim is pre-empted by the Federal\nCigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, as amended\n(Labeling Act). The Court of Appeals reversed that judg\nment, and we granted certiorari to review its holding that\nthe Labeling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre\nempts respondents’ fraud claim. We affirm.\n2                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n  Respondents are Maine residents and longtime smokers\nof Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes,\nwhich are manufactured by petitioners. Invoking the\ndiversity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court, re\nspondents filed a complaint alleging that petitioners delib\nerately deceived them about the true and harmful nature\nof “light” cigarettes in violation of the MUTPA, Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207 (Supp. 2008).1 Respondents claim\nthat petitioners fraudulently marketed their cigarettes as\nbeing “light” and containing “ ‘[l]owered [t]ar and\n[n]icotine’ ” to convey to consumers that they deliver less\ntar and nicotine and are therefore less harmful than regu\nlar cigarettes. App. 28a–29a.\n  Respondents acknowledge that testing pursuant to the\nCambridge Filter Method2 indicates that tar and nicotine\nyields of Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights are lower\nthan those of regular cigarettes. Id., at 30a. Respondents\nallege, however, that petitioners have known at all rele\nvant times that human smokers unconsciously engage in\ncompensatory behaviors not registered by Cambridge\nFilter Method testing that negate the effect of the tar- and\n——————\n   1 The MUTPA provides, as relevant, that “[u]nfair methods of compe\n\ntition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any\ntrade or commerce are declared unlawful.” §207. In construing that\nsection, courts are to “be guided by the interpretations given by the\nFederal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to Section 45(a)(1)\nof the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 United States Code 45(a)(1)),\nas from time to time amended.” §207(1).\n   2 The Cambridge Filter Method weighs and measures the tar and\n\nnicotine collected by a smoking machine that takes 35 milliliter puffs of\ntwo seconds’ duration every 60 seconds until the cigarette is smoked to\na specified butt length. App. 294a, 668a. As discussed below, the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) signaled in 1966 that\nthe Cambridge Filter Method was an acceptable means of measuring\nthe tar and nicotine content of cigarettes, but it never required manu\nfacturers to publish test results in their advertisements.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnicotine-reducing features of “light” cigarettes. Id., at\n30a–31a. By covering filter ventilation holes with their\nlips or fingers, taking larger or more frequent puffs, and\nholding the smoke in their lungs for a longer period of\ntime, smokers of “light” cigarettes unknowingly inhale as\nmuch tar and nicotine as do smokers of regular cigarettes.\nIbid. “Light” cigarettes are in fact more harmful because\nthe increased ventilation that results from their unique\ndesign features produces smoke that is more mutagenic\nper milligram of tar than the smoke of regular cigarettes.\nId., at 31a–32a. Respondents claim that petitioners vio\nlated the MUTPA by fraudulently concealing that infor\nmation and by affirmatively representing, through the use\nof “light” and “lowered tar and nicotine” descriptors, that\ntheir cigarettes would pose fewer health risks. Id., at 32a,\n33a.\n   Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground\nthat the Labeling Act, 15 U. S. C. §1334(b), expressly pre\nempts respondents’ state-law cause of action. Relying on\nour decisions in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S.\n504 (1992), and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S.\n525 (2001), the District Court concluded that respondents’\nMUTPA claim is pre-empted. The court recast respon\ndents’ claim as a failure-to-warn or warning neutralization\nclaim of the kind pre-empted in Cipollone: The claim\ncharges petitioners with “produc[ing] a product it knew\ncontained hidden risks . . . not apparent or known to the\nconsumer”—a claim that “runs to what [petitioners] actu\nally said about Lights and what [respondents] claim they\nshould have said.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 151 (Me. 2006).\nAnd the difference between what petitioners said and\nwhat respondents would have them say is “ ‘intertwined\nwith the concern about cigarette smoking and health.’ ”\nId., at 153 (quoting Reilly, 533 U. S., at 548). The District\nCourt thus concluded that respondents’ claim rests on a\nstate-law requirement based on smoking and health of\n4               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecisely the kind that §1334(b) pre-empts, and it granted\nsummary judgment for petitioners.\n  Respondents appealed, and the Court of Appeals re\nversed. The Court of Appeals first rejected the District\nCourt’s characterization of respondents’ claim as a warn\ning neutralization claim akin to the pre-empted claim in\nCipollone. 501 F. 3d 29, 37, 40 (CA1 2007). Instead, the\ncourt concluded that respondents’ claim is in substance a\nfraud claim that alleges that petitioners falsely repre\nsented their cigarettes as “light” or having “lowered tar\nand nicotine” even though they deliver to smokers the\nsame quantities of those components as do regular ciga\nrettes. Id., at 36. “The fact that these alleged misrepre\nsentations were unaccompanied by additional statements\nin the nature of a warning does not transform the claimed\nfraud into failure to warn” or warning neutralization. Id.,\nat 42–43. Finding respondents’ claim indistinguishable\nfrom the non-pre-empted fraud claim at issue in Cipollone,\nthe Court of Appeals held that it is not expressly pre\nempted. The court also rejected petitioners’ argument\nthat respondents’ claim is impliedly pre-empted because\ntheir success on that claim would stand as an obstacle to\nthe purported policy of the FTC allowing the use of de\nscriptive terms that convey Cambridge Filter Method test\nresults. Accordingly, it reversed the judgment of the\nDistrict Court.\n  In concluding that respondents’ claim is not expressly\npre-empted, the Court of Appeals considered and rejected\nthe Fifth Circuit’s reasoning in a similar case. 501 F. 3d,\nat 45. Unlike the court below, the Fifth Circuit likened\nthe plaintiffs’ challenge to the use of “light” descriptors to\nCipollone’s warning neutralization claim and thus found it\nexpressly pre-empted. Brown v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 479 F. 3d 383, 392–393 (2007). We granted\nthe petition for certiorari to resolve this apparent conflict.\n552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981).\n   Our inquiry into the scope of a statute’s pre-emptive\neffect is guided by the rule that “ ‘[t]he purpose of Congress\nis the ultimate touchstone’ in every pre-emption case.”\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996) (quoting\nRetail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103 (1963)).\nCongress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a\nstatute’s express language or through its structure and\npurpose. See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519,\n525 (1977). If a federal law contains an express pre\nemption clause, it does not immediately end the inquiry\nbecause the question of the substance and scope of Con\ngress’ displacement of state law still remains. Pre\nemptive intent may also be inferred if the scope of the\nstatute indicates that Congress intended federal law to\noccupy the legislative field, or if there is an actual conflict\nbetween state and federal law. Freightliner Corp. v.\nMyrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995).\n   When addressing questions of express or implied pre\nemption, we begin our analysis “with the assumption that\nthe historic police powers of the States [are] not to be\nsuperseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear\nand manifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe\nElevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). That assump\ntion applies with particular force when Congress has\nlegislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States.\nLohr, 518 U. S., at 485; see also Reilly, 533 U. S., at 541–\n542 (“Because ‘federal law is said to bar state action in [a]\n6                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

Thus, when the text of a\npre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausi\nble reading, courts ordinarily “accept the reading that\ndisfavors pre-emption.” Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,\n544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005).\n   Congress enacted the Labeling Act in 19653 in response\nto the Surgeon General’s determination that cigarette\nsmoking is harmful to health. The Act required that every\npackage of cigarettes sold in the United States contain a\nconspicuous warning, and it pre-empted state-law positive\nenactments that added to the federally prescribed warn\ning. 79 Stat. 283. Congress amended the Labeling Act a\nfew years later by enacting the Public Health Cigarette\nSmoking Act of 1969.4 The amendments strengthened the\nlanguage of the prescribed warning, 84 Stat. 88, and pro\nhibited cigarette advertising in “any medium of electronic\ncommunication subject to [FCC] jurisdiction,” id., at 89.\nThey also broadened the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provi\nsion. See Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion)\n(discussing the difference in scope of the pre-emption\nclauses of the 1965 and 1969 Acts). The Labeling Act has\nsince been amended further to require cigarette manufac\nturers to include four more explicit warnings in their\npackaging and advertisements on a rotating basis.5\n   The stated purpose of the Labeling Act is\n       “to establish a comprehensive Federal program to deal\n\n——————\n    3 79\n       Stat. 282.\n    4 Pub.\n         L. 91–222, 84 Stat. 87.

S. C.\n    §1331.\nThe requirement that cigarette manufacturers include in\ntheir packaging and advertising the precise warnings\nmandated by Congress furthers the Act’s first purpose.\nAnd the Act’s pre-emption provisions promote its second\npurpose.\n  As amended, the Labeling Act contains two express pre\nemption provisions. Section 5(a) protects cigarette manu\nfacturers from inconsistent state labeling laws by prohibit\ning the requirement of additional statements relating to\nsmoking and health on cigarette packages. 15 U. S. C.\n§1334(a). Section 5(b), which is at issue in this case,\nprovides that “[n]o requirement or prohibition based on\nsmoking and health shall be imposed under State law with\nrespect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\nthe packages of which are labeled in conformity with the\nprovisions of this chapter.” §1334(b).\n  Together, the labeling requirement and pre-emption\nprovisions express Congress’ determination that the pre\nscribed federal warnings are both necessary and sufficient\nto achieve its purpose of informing the public of the health\nconsequences of smoking. Because Congress has decided\n8                   ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat no additional warning statement is needed to attain\nthat goal, States may not impede commerce in cigarettes\nby enforcing rules that are based on an assumption that\nthe federal warnings are inadequate. Although both of the\nAct’s purposes are furthered by prohibiting States from\nsupplementing the federally prescribed warning, neither\nwould be served by limiting the States’ authority to pro\nhibit deceptive statements in cigarette advertising. Peti\ntioners acknowledge that “Congress had no intention of\ninsulating tobacco companies from liability for inaccurate\nstatements about the relationship between smoking and\nhealth.” Brief for Petitioners 28. But they maintain that\nCongress could not have intended to permit the enforce\nment of state fraud rules because doing so would defeat\nthe Labeling Act’s purpose of preventing nonuniform state\nwarning requirements. 15 U. S. C. §1331.6 As we ob\n——————\n   6 Petitioners also urge us to find support for their claim that Congress\n\ngave the FTC exclusive authority to police deceptive health-related\nclaims in cigarette advertising in what they refer to as the Labeling\nAct’s “saving clause.” The clause provides that, apart from the warning\nrequirement, nothing in the Act “shall be construed to limit, restrict,\nexpand, or otherwise affect the authority of the Federal Trade Commis\nsion with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the advertis\ning of cigarettes.” §1336. A plurality of this Court has previously read\nthis clause to “indicat[e] that Congress intended the phrase ‘relating to\nsmoking and health’ . . . to be construed narrowly, so as not to pro\nscribe the regulation of deceptive advertising.” Cipollone v. Liggett\nGroup, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 528–529 (1992). Nothing in the clause\nsuggests that Congress meant to proscribe the States’ historic regula\ntion of deceptive advertising practices. The FTC has long depended on\ncooperative state regulation to achieve its mission because, although\none of the smallest administrative agencies, it is charged with policing\nan enormous amount of activity. See 1 S. Kanwit, Federal Trade\nCommission §§1:1, 1:2 (2004 ed. and Supp. 2008). Moreover, when the\nLabeling Act was amended in 1969 it was not even clear that the FTC\npossessed rulemaking authority, see 84 Stat. 89, making it highly\nunlikely that Congress would have intended to assign exclusively to\nthe FTC the substantial task of overseeing deceptive practices in\ncigarette advertisements.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

S., at 529 (plu\nrality opinion).\n   Although it is clear that fidelity to the Act’s purposes\ndoes not demand the pre-emption of state fraud rules, the\nprincipal question that we must decide is whether the text\nof §1334(b) nevertheless requires that result.\n                               III\n  We have construed the operative phrases of §1334(b) in\ntwo prior cases: Cipollone, 505 U. S. 504, and Reilly, 533\nU. S. 525. On both occasions we recognized that the\nphrase “based on smoking and health” modifies the state\nlaw rule at issue rather than a particular application of\nthat rule.\n  In Cipollone, the plurality, which consisted of Chief\nJustice Rehnquist and Justices White, O’Connor, and\nSTEVENS, read the pre-emption provision in the 1969\namendments to the Labeling Act to pre-empt common-law\nrules as well as positive enactments. Unlike Justices\nBlackmun, KENNEDY, and SOUTER, the plurality con\ncluded that the provision does not preclude all common\nlaw claims that have some relationship to smoking and\nhealth. 505 U. S., at 521–523. To determine whether a\nparticular common-law claim is pre-empted, the plurality\ninquired “whether the legal duty that is the predicate of\nthe common-law damages action constitutes a ‘require\nment or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . with\nrespect to . . . advertising or promotion,’ giving that clause\na fair but narrow reading.” Id., at 524.\n  Applying this standard, the plurality held that the\nplaintiff’s claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudu\nlently misrepresented and concealed a material fact was\nnot pre-empted. That claim alleged a violation of the\nmanufacturers’ duty not to deceive—a duty that is not\n“based on” smoking and health. Id., at 528–529. Respon\n10                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

The duty\ncodified in that state statute, like the duty imposed by the\nstate common-law rule at issue in Cipollone, has nothing\nto do with smoking and health.7\n   Petitioners endeavor to distance themselves from that\nholding by arguing that respondents’ claim is more analo\ngous to the “warning neutralization” claim found to be pre\nempted in Cipollone. Although the plurality understood\nthe plaintiff to have presented that claim as a “theory of\nfraudulent misrepresentation,” id., at 528, the gravamen\nof the claim was the defendants’ failure to warn, as it was\n“predicated on a state-law prohibition against statements\nin advertising and promotional materials that tend to\nminimize the health hazards associated with smoking,”\nid., at 527. Thus understood, the Cipollone plurality’s\nanalysis of the warning neutralization claim has no appli\ncation in this case.8\n\n——————\n   7 In his dissent, JUSTICE THOMAS criticizes our reliance on the plural\n\nity opinion in Cipollone, post, at 6–8, 14–19, 22, and advocates adopting\nthe analysis set forth by JUSTICE SCALIA in his opinion concurring in the\njudgment in part and dissenting in part in that case, post, at 3–6, 19–\n21. But JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach was rejected by seven Members of\nthe Court, and in the almost 17 years since Cipollone was decided\nCongress has done nothing to indicate its approval of that approach.\nMoreover, JUSTICE THOMAS fails to explain why Congress would have\nintended the result that JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach would produce—\nnamely, permitting cigarette manufacturers to engage in fraudulent\nadvertising. As a majority of the Court concluded in Cipollone, nothing\nin the Labeling Act’s language or purpose supports that result.\n   8 The Cipollone plurality further stated that the warning neutraliza\n\ntion claim was “merely the converse of a state-law requirement that\nwarnings be included in advertising and promotional materials,” 505\nU. S., at 527, evincing the plurality’s recognition that warning neutrali\nzation and failure-to-warn claims are two sides of the same coin.\nJUSTICE THOMAS’ criticism of the plurality’s treatment of the failure-to\nwarn claim, post, at 16, is beside the point, as no such claim is at issue\nin this litigation.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  Petitioners nonetheless contend that respondents’ claim\nis like the pre-empted warning neutralization claim be\ncause it is based on statements that “might create a false\nimpression” rather than statements that are “inherently\nfalse.” Brief for Petitioners 39. But the extent of the\nfalsehood alleged does not alter the nature of the claim.\nNothing in the Labeling Act’s text or purpose or in the\nplurality opinion in Cipollone suggests that whether a\nclaim is pre-empted turns in any way on the distinction\nbetween misleading and inherently false statements.\nPetitioners’ misunderstanding is the same one that led the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, when confronted\nwith a “light” descriptors claim, to reach a result at odds\nwith the Court of Appeals’ decision in this case. See\nBrown, 479 F. 3d, at 391–393. Certainly, the extent of the\nfalsehood alleged may bear on whether a plaintiff can\nprove her fraud claim, but the merits of respondents’ claim\nare not before us.\n  Once that erroneous distinction is set aside, it is clear\nthat our holding in Cipollone that the common-law fraud\nclaim was not pre-empted is directly applicable to the\nstatutory claim at issue in this case. As was true of the\nclaim in Cipollone, respondents’ claim that the deceptive\nstatements “light” and “lowered tar and nicotine” induced\nthem to purchase petitioners’ product alleges a breach of\nthe duty not to deceive.9 To be sure, the presence of the\nfederally mandated warnings may bear on the materiality\nof petitioners’ allegedly fraudulent statements, “but that\npossibility does not change [respondents’] case from one\n——————\n  9 As the Court of Appeals observed, respondents’ allegations regard\n\ning petitioners’ use of the statements “light” and “lowered tar and\nnicotine” could also support a warning neutralization claim. But\nrespondents did not bring such a claim, and the fact that they could\nhave does not, as petitioners suggest, elevate form over substance.\nThere is nothing new in the recognition that the same conduct might\nviolate multiple proscriptions.\n12                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nabout the statements into one about the warnings.” 501\nF. 3d, at 44.10\n  Our decision in Reilly is consistent with Cipollone’s\nanalysis. Reilly involved regulations promulgated by the\nMassachusetts attorney general “ ‘in order to address the\nincidence of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use\nby children under legal age . . . [and] in order to prevent\naccess to such products by underage customers.’ ” 533\nU. S., at 533 (quoting 940 Code Mass. Regs. §21.01 (2000)).\nThe regulations did not pertain to the content of any\nadvertising; rather, they placed a variety of restrictions on\ncertain cigarette sales and the location of outdoor and\npoint-of-sale cigarette advertising. The attorney general\npromulgated those restrictions pursuant to his statutory\nauthority to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices.\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93A, §2 (West 1996). But although\nthe attorney general’s authority derived from a general\ndeceptive practices statute like the one at issue in this\ncase, the challenged regulations targeted advertising that\ntended to promote tobacco use by children instead of pro\nhibiting false or misleading statements. Thus, whereas\nthe “prohibition” in Cipollone was the common-law fraud\nrule, the “prohibitions” in Reilly were the targeted regula\n——————\n  10 JUSTICE  THOMAS contends that respondents’ fraud claim must be\npre-empted because “[a] judgment in [their] favor will . . . result in a\n‘requirement’ that petitioners represent the effects of smoking on\nhealth in a particular way in their advertising and promotion of light\ncigarettes.” Post, at 3. He further asserts that “respondents seek to\nrequire the cigarette manufacturers to provide additional warnings\nabout compensatory behavior, or to prohibit them from selling these\nproducts with the ‘light’ or ‘low-tar’ descriptors.” Post, at 20. But this\nmischaracterizes the relief respondents seek. If respondents prevail at\ntrial, petitioners will be prohibited from selling as “light” or “low tar”\nonly those cigarettes that are not actually light and do not actually\ndeliver less tar and nicotine. Barring intervening federal regulation,\npetitioners would remain free to make nonfraudulent use of the “light”\nand “low-tar” descriptors.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntions. Accordingly, our holding in Reilly that the regula\ntions were pre-empted provides no support for an argu\nment that a general prohibition of deceptive practices is\n“based on” the harm caused by the specific kind of decep\ntion to which the prohibition is applied in a given case.\n   It is true, as petitioners argue, that the appeal of their\nadvertising is based on the relationship between smoking\nand health. And although respondents have expressly\nrepudiated any claim for damages for personal injuries,\nsee App. 26a, their actual injuries likely encompass harms\nto health as well as the monetary injuries they allege.\nThese arguments are unavailing, however, because the\ntext of §1334(b) does not refer to harms related to smoking\nand health. Rather, it pre-empts only requirements and\nprohibitions—i.e., rules—that are based on smoking and\nhealth. The MUTPA says nothing about either “smoking”\nor “health.” It is a general rule that creates a duty not to\ndeceive and is therefore unlike the regulations at issue in\nReilly.11\n   Petitioners argue in the alternative that we should\nreject the express pre-emption framework established by\nthe Cipollone plurality and relied on by the Court in\nReilly. In so doing, they invoke the reasons set forth in\nthe separate opinions of Justice Blackmun (who especially\ncriticized the plurality’s holding that the failure-to-warn\nclaim was pre-empted) and JUSTICE SCALIA (who argued\nthat the fraud claim also should be pre-empted). While we\nagain acknowledge that our analysis of these claims may\nlack “theoretical elegance,” we remain persuaded that it\n——————\n  11 In implementing the MUTPA, neither the state legislature nor the\n\nstate attorney general has enacted a set of special rules or guidelines\ntargeted at cigarette advertising. As we noted in Cipollone, it was the\nthreatened enactment of new state warning requirements rather than\nthe enforcement of pre-existing general prohibitions against deceptive\npractices that prompted congressional action in 1969. 505 U. S., at 515,\nand n. 11.\n14                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrepresents “a fair understanding of congressional pur\npose.” Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 529–530, n. 27 (plurality\nopinion).\n   Petitioners also contend that the plurality opinion is\ninconsistent with our decisions in American Airlines, Inc.\nv. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219 (1995), and Riegel v. Medtronic,\nInc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008). Both cases, however, are inap\nposite—the first because it involved a pre-emption provi\nsion much broader than the Labeling Act’s, and the second\nbecause it involved precisely the type of state rule that\nCongress had intended to pre-empt.\n   At issue in Wolens was the pre-emptive effect of the\nAirline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 49 U. S. C.\nApp. §1305(a)(1) (1988 ed.), which prohibits States from\nenacting or enforcing any law “relating to rates, routes, or\nservices of any air carrier.” The plaintiffs in that case\nsought to bring a claim under the Illinois Consumer Fraud\nand Deceptive Business Practices Act, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch.\n815, §505 (West 1992). Our conclusion that the state-law\nclaim was pre-empted turned on the unusual breadth of\nthe ADA’s pre-emption provision. We had previously held\nthat the meaning of the key phrase in the ADA’s pre\nemption provision, “ ‘relating to rates, routes, or services,’ ”\nis a broad one. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504\nU. S. 374, 383–384 (1992) (emphasis added). Relying on\nprecedents construing the pre-emptive effect of the same\nphrase in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974, 29 U. S. C. §1144(a), we concluded that the phrase\n“relating to” indicates Congress’ intent to pre-empt a large\narea of state law to further its purpose of deregulating the\nairline industry. 504 U. S., at 383–384.12 Unquestionably,\n——————\n  12 Petitioners also point to Morales as evidence that our decision in\n\nCipollone was wrong. But Morales predated Cipollone, and it is in any\nevent even more easily distinguishable from this case than American\nAirlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S 219 (1995). At issue in Morales were\nguidelines regarding the form and substance of airline fare advertising\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe phrase “relating to” has a broader scope than the\nLabeling Act’s reference to rules “based on” smoking and\nhealth; whereas “relating to” is synonymous with “having\na connection with,” id., at 384, “based on” describes a more\ndirect relationship, see Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr,\n551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 13) (“In common talk,\nthe phrase ‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relation\nship and thus a necessary logical condition”).\n  Petitioners’ reliance on Riegel is similarly misplaced.\nThe plaintiffs in Riegel sought to bring common-law de\nsign, manufacturing, and labeling defect claims against\nthe manufacturer of a faulty catheter. The case presented\nthe question whether those claims were expressly pre\nempted by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976\n(MDA), 21 U. S. C. §360c et seq. The MDA’s pre-emption\nclause provides that no State “ ‘may establish or continue\nin effect with respect to a device . . . any requirement’\nrelating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or\nin addition to, federal requirements.” Riegel, 552 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting 21 U. S. C. §360k(a); emphasis\ndeleted).\n  The catheter at issue in Riegel had received premarket\napproval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nWe concluded that premarket approval imposes “require\nment[s] relating to safety [and] effectiveness” because the\nFDA requires a device that has received premarket ap\nproval to be made with almost no design, manufacturing,\nor labeling deviations from the specifications in its ap\nproved application.       The plaintiffs’ products liability\n——————\nimplemented by the National Association of Attorneys General to give\ncontent to state deceptive practices rules. 504 U. S., at 379. Like the\nregulations at issue in Reilly, the guidelines were industry-specific\ndirectives that targeted the subject matter made off-limits by the ADA’s\nexpress pre-emption provisions. See also Rowe v. New Hampshire\nMotor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. ___ (2008) (holding that targeted ground\ncarrier regulations were pre-empted by a statute modeled on the ADA).\n16              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims fell within the core of the MDA’s pre-emption pro\nvision because they sought to impose different require\nments on precisely those aspects of the device that the\nFDA had approved. Unlike the Cipollone plaintiff’s fraud\nclaim, which fell outside of the Labeling Act’s pre-emptive\nreach because it did not seek to impose a prohibition\n“based on smoking and health,” the Riegel plaintiffs’ com\nmon-law products liability claims unquestionably sought\nto enforce “requirement[s] relating to safety or effective\nness” under the MDA. That the “relating to” language of\nthe MDA’s pre-emption provision is, like the ADA’s, much\nbroader than the operative language of the Labeling Act\nprovides an additional basis for distinguishing Riegel.\nThus, contrary to petitioners’ suggestion, Riegel is entirely\nconsistent with our holding in Cipollone.\n  In sum, we conclude now, as the plurality did in Cipol\nlone, that “the phrase ‘based on smoking and health’ fairly\nbut narrowly construed does not encompass the more\ngeneral duty not to make fraudulent statements.” 505\nU. S., at 529.\n                            IV\n   As an alternative to their express pre-emption argu\nment, petitioners contend that respondents’ claim is impli\nedly pre-empted because, if allowed to proceed, it would\npresent an obstacle to a longstanding policy of the FTC.\nAccording to petitioners, the FTC has for decades pro\nmoted the development and consumption of low tar ciga\nrettes and has encouraged consumers to rely on represen\ntations of tar and nicotine content based on Cambridge\nFilter Method testing in choosing among cigarette brands.\nEven if such a regulatory policy could provide a basis for\nobstacle pre-emption, petitioners’ description of the FTC’s\nactions in this regard are inaccurate. The Government\nitself disavows any policy authorizing the use of “light”\nand “low tar” descriptors. Brief for United States as\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

App. 478a. The Commission made\nclear, however, that the guidance applied only to factual\nassertions of tar and nicotine yields and did not invite\n“collateral representations . . . made, expressly or by im\nplication, as to reduction or elimination of health haz\nards.” Id., at 479a. A year later, the FTC reiterated its\nposition in a letter to the National Association of Broad\ncasters. The letter explained that, as a “general rule,” the\nCommission would not challenge statements of tar and\nnicotine content when “they are shown to be accurate and\nfully substantiated by tests conducted in accordance with\nthe [Cambridge Filter Method].” Id., at 368a. In 1970, the\nFTC considered providing further guidance, proposing a\nrule that would have required manufacturers to disclose\ntar and nicotine yields as measured by Cambridge Filter\nMethod testing. 35 Fed. Reg. 12671. The leading ciga\nrette manufacturers responded by submitting a voluntary\nagreement under which they would disclose tar and nico\ntine content in their advertising, App. 899a–900a, and the\nFTC suspended its rulemaking, 36 Fed. Reg. 784 (1971).\n  Based on these events, petitioners assert that “the FTC\nhas required tobacco companies to disclose tar and nico\ntine yields in cigarette advertising using a government\nmandated testing methodology and has authorized them\nto use descriptors as shorthand references to those nu\nmerical test results.” Brief for Petitioners 2 (emphasis in\noriginal). As the foregoing history shows, however, the\nFTC has in fact never required that cigarette manufactur\ners disclose tar and nicotine yields, nor has it condoned\n18                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrepresentations of those yields through the use of “light”\nor “low tar” descriptors.\n   Subsequent Commission actions further undermine\npetitioners’ claim. After the tobacco companies agreed to\nreport tar and nicotine yields as measured by the Cam\nbridge Filter Method, the FTC continued to police ciga\nrette companies’ misleading use of test results. In 1983,\nthe FTC responded to findings that tar and nicotine yields\nfor Barclay cigarettes obtained through Cambridge Filter\nMethod testing were deceptive because the cigarettes in\nfact delivered disproportionately more tar to smokers than\nother cigarettes with similar Cambridge Filter Method\nratings. 48 Fed. Reg. 15954. And in 1995, the FTC found\nthat a manufacturer’s representation “that consumers will\nget less tar by smoking ten packs of Carlton brand ciga\nrettes than by smoking a single pack of the other brands”\nwas deceptive even though it was based on the results of\nCambridge Filter Method testing. In re American Tobacco\nCo., 119 F. T. C. 3, 4. The FTC’s conclusion was based on\nits recognition that, “[i]n truth and in fact, consumers will\nnot necessarily get less tar” due to “such behavior as\ncompensatory smoking.” Ibid.13\n——————\n  13 In a different action, the FTC charged a cigarette manufacturer\n\nwith violating the FTC Act by misleadingly advertising certain brands\nas “low in tar” even though they had a higher-than-average tar rating.\nSee In re American Brands, Inc., 79 F. T. C. 255 (1971). The Commis\nsion and the manufacturer entered a consent order that prevented the\nmanufacturer from making any such representations unless they were\naccompanied by a clear and conspicuous disclosure of the cigarettes’ tar\nand nicotine content as measured by the Cambridge Filter Method. Id.,\nat 258. Petitioners offer this consent order as evidence that the FTC\nauthorized the use of “light” and “low tar” descriptors as long as they\naccurately describe Cambridge Filter Method test results. As the\nGovernment observes, however, the decree only enjoined conduct. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 26. And a consent order is in any\nevent only binding on the parties to the agreement. For all of these\nreasons, the consent order does not support the conclusion that respon\ndents’ claim is impliedly pre-empted.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   This history shows that, contrary to petitioners’ sugges\ntion, the FTC has no longstanding policy authorizing\ncollateral representations based on Cambridge Filter\nMethod test results. Rather, the FTC has endeavored to\ninform consumers of the comparative tar and nicotine\ncontent of different cigarette brands and has in some\ninstances prevented misleading representations of Cam\nbridge Filter Method test results. The FTC’s failure to\nrequire petitioners to correct their allegedly misleading\nuse of “light” descriptors is not evidence to the contrary;\nagency nonenforcement of a federal statute is not the same\nas a policy of approval. Cf. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,\n537 U. S. 51 (2002) (holding that the Coast Guard’s deci\nsion not to regulate propeller guards did not impliedly pre\nempt petitioner’s tort claims).14\n   More telling are the FTC’s recent statements regarding\nthe use of “light” and “low tar” descriptors. In 1997, the\nCommission observed that “[t]here are no official defini\ntions for” the terms “light” and “low tar,” and it sought\ncomments on whether “there [is] a need for official guid\nance with respect to the terms” and whether “the descrip\ntors convey implied health claims.” 62 Fed. Reg. 48163.\nIn November 2008, following public notice and comment,\nthe Commission rescinded its 1966 guidance concerning\nthe Cambridge Filter Method. 73 Fed. Reg. 74500. The\nrescission is a response to “a consensus among the public\nhealth and scientific communities that the Cambridge\nFilter method is sufficiently flawed that statements of tar\nand nicotine yields as measured by that method are not\nlikely to help consumers make informed decisions.” Id., at\n74503. The Commission’s notice of its proposal to rescind\n——————\n  14 It seems particularly inappropriate to read a policy of authorization\n\ninto the FTC’s inaction when that inaction is in part the result of\npetitioners’ failure to disclose study results showing that Cambridge\nFilter Method test results do not reflect the amount of tar and nicotine\nthat consumers of “light” cigarettes actually inhale. See id., at 8–11.\n20              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe guidance also reiterated the original limits of that\nguidance, noting that it “only addresse[d] simple factual\nstatements of tar and nicotine yields. It d[id] not apply to\nother conduct or express or implied representations, even\nif they concern[ed] tar and nicotine yields.” Id., at 40351.\n   In short, neither the handful of industry guidances and\nconsent orders on which petitioners rely nor the FTC’s\ninaction with regard to “light” descriptors even arguably\njustifies the pre-emption of state deceptive practices rules\nlike the MUTPA.\n                             V\n  We conclude, as we did in Cipollone, that the Labeling\nAct does not pre-empt state-law claims like respondents’\nthat are predicated on the duty not to deceive. We also\nhold that the FTC’s various decisions with respect to\nstatements of tar and nicotine content do not impliedly\npre-empt respondents’ claim. Respondents still must\nprove that petitioners’ use of “light” and “lowered tar”\ndescriptors in fact violated the state deceptive practices\nstatute, but neither the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provi\nsion nor the FTC’s actions in this field prevent a jury from\nconsidering that claim. Accordingly, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992). As\nin that case, the question before us is whether state-law\nclaims alleging that cigarette manufacturers misled the\npublic about the health effects of cigarettes are pre­\nempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising\nAct, as amended in 1969 (Labeling Act or Act). The Label­\ning Act requires that specific health warnings be placed on\nall cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U. S. C. §1333,\nin order to eliminate “diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\ncigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect\nto any relationship between smoking and health,” §1331.\nTo that end, §5(b) of the Labeling Act pre-empts any “re­\nquirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . .\nimposed under State law with respect to the advertising or\npromotion of any cigarettes.” §1334(b).\n  Whether §5(b) pre-empts state common-law claims\ndivided the Court in Cipollone. The plurality opinion\nfound some claims expressly pre-empted and others not,\ndepending on whether “the legal duty that is the predicate\nof the common-law damages action constitutes a require­\nment or prohibition based on smoking and health . . .\nimposed under State law with respect to . . . advertising or\n2               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npromotion.” 505 U. S., at 524 (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis added). A majority of the Court dis­\nagreed with the plurality’s predicate-duty approach. Id.,\nat 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in\njudgment in part, and dissenting in part); id., at 552–554\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting\nin part). In particular, JUSTICE SCALIA recognized that\nthe plurality’s interpretation of §5(b) created an unwork­\nable test for pre-emption with little or no relationship to\nthe text of the statute. Id., at 544, 555–556. The interven­\ning years have vindicated JUSTICE SCALIA’s critical as­\nsessment; the lower courts have consistently expressed\nfrustration at the difficulty in applying the Cipollone\nplurality’s test. Moreover, this Court’s recent pre-emption\ndecisions have undermined, and in some cases overruled,\ncentral aspects of the plurality’s atextual approach to\nexpress pre-emption generally, Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.,\n552 U. S. ___ (2008), and to §5(b) of the Labeling Act\nspecifically, Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525\n(2001).\n   The majority today ignores these problems and adopts\nthe methodology of the Cipollone plurality as governing\nlaw. As a consequence, the majority concludes that state­\nlaw liability for deceiving purchasers about the health\neffects of smoking light cigarettes is not a “requirement or\nprohibition based on smoking and health” under the La­\nbeling Act. The Court’s fidelity to Cipollone is unwise and\nunnecessary. The Court should instead provide the lower\ncourts with a clear test that advances Congress’ stated\ngoals by interpreting §5(b) to expressly pre-empt any\nclaim that “imposes an obligation . . . because of the effect\nof smoking upon health.” Cipollone, supra, at 554 (opinion\nof SCALIA, J.).\n   Respondents’ lawsuit under the Maine Unfair Trade\nPractices Act (MUTPA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207\n(Supp. 2008), is expressly pre-empted under §5(b) of the\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nLabeling Act. The civil action is premised on the allega­\ntion that the cigarette manufacturers misled respondents\ninto believing that smoking light cigarettes would be\nhealthier for them than smoking regular cigarettes. A\njudgment in respondents’ favor will thus result in a “re­\nquirement” that petitioners represent the effects of smok­\ning on health in a particular way in their advertising and\npromotion of light cigarettes. Because liability in this case\nis thereby premised on the effect of smoking on health, I\nwould hold that respondents’ state-law claims are ex­\npressly pre-empted by §5(b) of the Labeling Act. I respect­\nfully dissent.\n                                I\n   In Cipollone, a smoker and her spouse brought state\ncommon-law claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and\nfailure to warn against cigarette manufacturers for their\nalleged failure to adequately disclose the health risks of\nsmoking. 505 U. S., at 509. As here, the cigarette manu­\nfacturer asserted that the claims were pre-empted by §5(b)\nof the Labeling Act.\n   In deciding the case, the Court could not agree on the\nmeaning of the Labeling Act’s express pre-emption provi­\nsion. It produced three separate opinions, none of which\nreflected the views of a majority of Justices. Relying\nheavily on a “presumption against the pre-emption of state\npolice power regulations,” a plurality opinion by JUSTICE\nSTEVENS settled on a “narrow reading” of the Labeling Act\nthat tested §5(b)’s pre-emptive effect under a claim-by­\nclaim approach. Id., at 524. This approach considered\neach state-law claim and asked whether it is predicated\n“on a duty ‘based on smoking and health.’ ” Id., at 528; see\nalso id., at 524. If so, the claim is pre-empted. Id., at 524,\n528. If, however, the claim is predicated on a “more gen­\neral obligation” under state law, it may proceed. Id., at\n528–529.\n4               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Applying a test that it conceded lacked “theoretical\nelegance,” id., at 530, n. 27, the plurality held that the\nfailure-to-warn claims were pre-empted “to the extent that\nthose claims rel[ied] on omissions or inclusions in . . .\nadvertising or promotions” of cigarettes. Id., at 531. The\nsame was true for one of the fraud claims, which alleged\nthat the cigarette manufacturers had used their advertis­\ning to neutralize the federally required warning labels.\nId., at 527–528. The plurality determined that these\nclaims were “predicated on a state-law prohibition against\nstatements . . . that tend to minimize the health hazards\nassociated with smoking.” Id., at 527. Thus, according to\nthe plurality, these state-law claims sought recovery\nunder the theory that the cigarette manufacturer\nbreached a duty based on smoking or health. But the\nplurality found that the other fraud claim, which alleged\nmisrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, was\nnot pre-empted because it was based on a more general\nstate-law obligation: “the duty not to deceive.” Id., at 528–\n529.\n  Justice Blackmun, writing for three Justices, departed\nfrom the plurality on the antecedent question whether the\nLabeling Act pre-empted state common-law damages\nclaims at all. Id., at 535–542 (opinion, joined by KENNEDY\nand SOUTER, JJ., concurring in part, concurring in judg­\nment in part, and dissenting in part). He concluded that\nthe phrase “ ‘State law’ ” in §5(b) referred only to “positive\nenactments such as statutes and regulations.” Id., at 535.\nBut Justice Blackmun specifically noted that even if state\ncommon-law claims were within the scope of the Labeling\nAct, he could not join the plurality’s claim-by-claim ap­\nproach because he “perceive[d] no principled basis for\nmany of the plurality’s asserted distinctions among the\ncommon-law claims.” Id., at 543. Justice Blackmun wrote\nthat Congress could not have “intended to create such a\nhodgepodge of allowed and disallowed claims when it\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Id., at 543–\n544.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, writing for two Justices, also faulted\nthe plurality for its claim-by-claim approach. Id., at 544–\n556 (opinion, joined by THOMAS, J., concurring in judg­\nment in part and dissenting in part). Although he agreed\nwith the plurality that the phrase “ ‘State law’ ” in §5(b)\nencompassed state common-law claims as well as state\nstatutes and regulations, id., at 548–549, JUSTICE SCALIA\nobjected to the plurality’s invocation of a presumption\nagainst pre-emption to narrowly interpret §5(b), id., at\n544, 545–547. Because Congress had expressed its intent\nto pre-empt state law by enacting §5(b), the Court’s “re­\nsponsibility [was] to apply to the text ordinary principles\nof statutory construction.” Id., at 545.1 By employing its\n“newly crafted doctrine of narrow construction,” JUSTICE\nSCALIA wrote, the plurality arrived at a cramped and\nunnatural construction of §5(b) that failed to give effect to\nthe statutory text. Id., at 544–548.\n  Applying “ordinary principles” of statutory construction,\nid., at 548, JUSTICE SCALIA determined that the proper\ntest for pre-emption of state-law claims under §5(b) was\nfar less complicated than the plurality’s claim-by-claim\napproach. As he explained, “[o]nce one is forced to select a\nconsistent methodology for evaluating whether a given\nlegal duty is ‘based on smoking and health,’ it becomes\nobvious that the methodology must focus not upon the\n——————\n  1 JUSTICE SCALIA also criticized the plurality for announcing a new\n\nrule that the enactment of an express pre-emption clause eliminates\nany consideration of implied pre-emption. He explained that this new\nrule created mischief because, when combined with the presumption\nagainst pre-emption, it placed a heavy burden of exactitude on Con­\ngress when it wishes to say anything about pre-emption. See Cipollone,\n505 U. S., at 547–548.\n6               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

This “proximate application”\ntest, therefore, focuses not on the state-law duty invoked\nby the plaintiff, but on the effect of the suit on the ciga­\nrette manufacturer’s conduct—i.e., the “requirement” or\n“prohibition” that would be imposed under state law. Put\nsimply, if, “whatever the source of the duty, [the claim]\nimposes an obligation . . . because of the effect of smoking\nupon health,” it is pre-empted. Id., at 554; see also id., at\n555 (“The test for pre-emption in this setting should be\none of practical compulsion, i.e., whether the law practi­\ncally compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior\nthat Congress has barred the States from prescribing\ndirectly”). JUSTICE SCALIA also seconded Justice Black­\nmun’s concern that the lower courts would find the plural­\nity’s distinctions between materially identical state-law\nclaims to be incapable of application: “A disposition that\nraises more questions than it answers does not serve the\ncountry well.” Id., at 556.\n                               II\n   Sixteen years later, we must confront Cipollone to re­\nsolve the question presented in this case: whether respon­\ndents’ class-action claims for fraudulent marketing under\nthe MUTPA are pre-empted by §5(b) of the Labeling Act.\nThe majority adheres to Cipollone because it “remain[s]\npersuaded” that the plurality’s construction of the §5(b)\nwas “ ‘fair.’ ” Ante, at 13–14. I disagree. The Court should\ndiscard the Cipollone plurality’s ill-conceived predicate­\nduty approach and replace it with JUSTICE SCALIA’s far\nmore workable and textually sound “proximate applica­\ntion” test.\n   The majority does not assert that the Cipollone plurality\nopinion is binding precedent, and rightly so. Because the\n“plurality opinion . . . did not represent the views of a\nmajority of the Court, we are not bound by its reasoning.”\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

The Cipollone plurality justified what it\ndescribed as the “theoretical [in]elegance” of its construc­\ntion of §5(b) by relying on the presumption against pre­\nemption, which, it argued, required a narrow, but “fair,”\nconstruction of the statute. 505 U. S., at 530, n. 27. See,\ne.g., id., at 518 (majority opinion) (“This presumption\nreinforces the appropriateness of a narrow reading of §5”);\nid., at 523 (plurality opinion) (“[W]e must . . . narrowly\nconstrue the precise language of §5(b)”); id., at 524 (§5(b)\nmust be given “a fair but narrow reading”); id., at 529\n(“[W]e conclude that the phrase ‘based on smoking and\nhealth’ fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass\nthe more general duty not to make fraudulent state­\nments”). Of course, as JUSTICE SCALIA explained, there\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwas nothing “fair” about imposing an artificially narrow\nconstruction on the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provision.\nSee id., at 545 (explaining that the presumption against\npre-emption “dissolves once there is conclusive evidence of\nintent to pre-empt in the express words of the statute\nitself ”).\n   Since Cipollone, the Court’s reliance on the presumption\nagainst pre-emption has waned in the express pre-emption\ncontext. In 2002, for example, the Court unanimously\nexplained that the “task of statutory construction must in\nthe first instance focus on the plain wording of the [ex­\npress pre-emption] clause, which necessarily contains the\nbest evidence of Congress’ pre-emptive intent.” Sprietsma\nv. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 62–63 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Without referring to any presumption\nagainst pre-emption, the Court decided that the Federal\nBoat Safety Act of 1971’s express pre-emption provision\ndid not pre-empt state-law claims. Id., at 62–64. Most\nother decisions since Cipollone also have refrained from\ninvoking the presumption in the context of express pre­\nemption. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp.\nAssn., 552 U. S. ___ (2008); Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South\nCoast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004);\nBuckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341\n(2001); United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89 (2000); Geier v.\nAmerican Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000).\n   The Court has invoked the presumption sporadically\nduring this time frame. As the majority notes, ante, at 5,\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470 (1996), applied the\npresumption against pre-emption in deciding that the\nfederal manufacturing and labeling requirements of the\nMedical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) did not pre­\nempt state common-law claims. Id., at 500–501. Like\nCipollone before it, Lohr produced a fractured decision\nfeaturing three opinions. 518 U. S., at 474 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.), id., at 503 (BREYER, J., concurring in part\n10                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nand concurring in judgment), id., at 509 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). And, like\nCipollone, Lohr’s approach to express pre-emption pre­\ndates the Court’s recent jurisprudence on the topic. In\nfact, this Court last year revisited the pre-emption provi­\nsion of the MDA, 21 U. S. C. §360k(a)(1), and did not\nemploy any presumption against pre-emption. Riegel v.\nMedtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008). See infra, at 11-13.2\n   More recently, in Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, a case revisiting\nthe meaning of §5(b) of the Labeling Act, the Court briefly\nalluded to the presumption, but did not rely on it to reach\nits decision. See id., at 541–542, 546–551. Indeed, the\nCourt’s cursory treatment of the presumption in Reilly\nstands in stark contrast to the First Circuit decision it\nreversed; the First Circuit relied heavily on the “full force”\nof the presumption to determine that the regulations at\nissue were not pre-empted. See Consolidated Cigar Corp.\nv. Reilly, 218 F. 3d 30, 38–41 (2000). This Court, in over­\nturning that judgment, declined to employ the presump­\ntion in its construction of §5(b). See Reilly, 533 U. S., at\n546–551. JUSTICE STEVENS highlighted this very point in\ndissent, arguing that if the presumption had been faith­\n\n\n——————\n  2 Also, as in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992), the\nfractured decision in Lohr was a source of confusion for the lower\ncourts. See Kemp v. Medtronic, Inc., 231 F. 3d 216, 224 (CA6 2000)\n(“The various courts of appeals that have confronted issues of preemp­\ntion arising under the MDA have struggled mightily with Lohr’s\nlanguage in an effort to discern its holding”); see also Martin v. Med\ntronic, Inc., 254 F. 3d 573, 579 (CA5 2001) (“Because only parts of\nJustice Stevens’s opinion commanded a majority, extracting the final\nmeaning of Lohr is no easy task. . . . Although Justice Breyer’s concur­\nrence very specifically disavows the view that common law duties\ncannot provide substantive requirements for the purpose of preemption,\nneither his concurrence nor the plurality opinion offers much help to us\nin developing the point”). The confusion was cleared up in Riegel. See\ninfra, at 11–13.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Dow Agrosciences\nLLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), where the presumption was\nagain mentioned, but only in dicta. As in Reilly, the pre­\nsumption did not drive the Court’s construction of the\nstatute at issue. 544 U. S., at 449 (explaining that the\npresumption meant just that the holding of no pre­\nemption would have been the same “even if [respondent’s]\nalternative [construction of the statute] were just as plau­\nsible as our reading of the text”); see also id., at 457\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent­\ning in part) (agreeing that the case should be vacated and\nremanded and reiterating that the “presumption does not\napply . . . when Congress has included within a statute an\nexpress pre-emption provision”). At bottom, although the\nCourt’s treatment of the presumption against pre-emption\nhas not been uniform, the Court’s express pre-emption\ncases since Cipollone have marked a retreat from reliance\non it to distort the statutory text.\n  If any doubt remained, it was eliminated last Term in\nRiegel. The question in Riegel, as noted above, was\nwhether the MDA expressly pre-empts state common-law\nclaims “challenging the safety and effectiveness of a medi­\ncal device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug\nAdministration.” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Over\nthe dissent of one Justice, the Court held that the state­\nlaw claims were pre-empted because the requirements the\nplaintiffs sought to impose were “ ‘different from, or in\naddition to, any requirement applicable . . . to the device’ ”\nunder federal law. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quoting 21\nU. S. C. §360k(a)(1)). The Court interpreted the statute\nwithout reference to the presumption or any perceived\nneed to impose a narrow construction on the provision in\norder to protect the police power of the States. Rather, the\n12                ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt simply construed the MDA in accordance with\nordinary principles of statutory construction.\n   This was not accidental. The dissent focused on the\nCourt’s refusal to invoke the presumption in order to save\nthe state-law claims from pre-emption. 552 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at ___) (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The dissent\nwas adamant that “[f]ederal laws containing a preemption\nclause do not automatically escape the presumption\nagainst pre-emption.” Ibid. (slip op., at 2–3); id., at ___\n(slip op., at 3) (“Where the text of a pre-emption clause is\nopen to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily\n‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption’ ” (quoting\nBates, supra, at 449)). In accordance with the presump­\ntion, the dissent would have found the state-law claims\nunder review to fall beyond the reach of the MDA’s ex­\npress pre-emption provision. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n___); see also id., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 6, n. 8); id., at ___,\nn. 9 (slip op., at 7, n. 9) (rejecting the majority’s construc­\ntion of §360(d) because “the presumption against pre­\nemption [is] operative even in construing a preemption\nclause”). Given the dissent’s clear call for the use of the\npresumption against pre-emption, the Court’s decision not\nto invoke it was necessarily a rejection of any role for the\npresumption in construing the statute.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS also declined to invoke the presump­\ntion in his opinion. Id., at ___ (opinion concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment). In his view, the “signifi­\ncance of the pre-emption provision in the [MDA] was not\nfully appreciated until many years after it was enacted”\nand, therefore, it is “a statute whose text and general\nobjective cover territory not actually envisioned by its\nauthors.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1). But JUSTICE STEVENS’\nopinion in Riegel—unlike the majority opinion here, the\nplurality opinion in Cipollone, and the dissenting opinion\nin Riegel—did not invoke the presumption to bend the text\nof the statute to meet the perceived purpose of Congress.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            13\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nInstead, JUSTICE STEVENS correctly found that “ ‘it is\nultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the\nprincipal concerns of our legislators by which we are gov­\nerned.’ ” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting Oncale v.\nSundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80\n(1998)).\n   In light of Riegel, there is no authority for invoking the\npresumption against pre-emption in express pre-emption\ncases. The majority here thus turns to Lohr to revive the\npresumption and, in turn, to justify its restrictive reading\nof the Labeling Act’s express pre-emption provision. But,\nas Riegel plainly shows, the Court is no longer willing to\nunreasonably interpret expressly pre-emptive federal laws\nin the name of “ ‘congressional purpose,’ ” ante, at 14, or\nbecause “Congress has legislated in a field traditionally\noccupied by the States,” ante, at 5. The text of the statute\nmust control.\n   Riegel also undermined Cipollone in an even more fun­\ndamental way: It conclusively decided that a common-law\ncause of action imposes a state-law “ ‘requiremen[t]’ ” that\nmay be pre-empted by federal law. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 11) (“Absent other indication, reference to a State’s\n‘requirements’ includes its common-law duties . . . . In­\ndeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries\nunder a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less\ndeserving of preservation [than regulatory legislation]”).\nJustice Blackmun’s contrary interpretation of §5(b) of the\nLabeling Act in Cipollone, 505 U.

In light of\nRiegel’s rejection of the presumption against pre-emption\nrelied on by the plurality, as well as the definition of “re­\nquirements” relied on in Justice Blackmun’s concurring\nopinion, Cipollone’s approach to express pre-emption is\nnothing more than “a remnant of abandoned doctrine.”\n14              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

S. 833, 855 (1992).\n                              C\n   The Cipollone plurality’s reading of §5(b) of the Labeling\nAct was further undermined by this Court’s decision in\nReilly, 533 U. S. 525. There, the Court confronted regula­\ntions imposed by the Massachusetts attorney general on\nthe location of tobacco advertising pursuant to the Com­\nmonwealth’s unfair trade practices statute. Id., at 533–\n536. The Court found the regulations—to the extent they\napplied to cigarettes—expressly pre-empted because,\nalthough Massachusetts remained free to enact “generally\napplicable zoning restrictions,” its imposition of “special\nrequirements or prohibitions ‘based on smoking and\nhealth’ ‘with respect to the advertising or promotion of\ncigarettes’ ” fell within the ambit of §5(b)’s pre-emptive\nsweep. Id., at 551.\n   Reilly did not ignore Cipollone. It cited the plurality\nopinion extensively in its discussion of the basic history\nand text of the Labeling Act. 533 U. S., at 540–546. But\nin analyzing whether the regulations enacted by the Mas­\nsachusetts attorney general were expressly pre-empted,\nthe Court was silent about Cipollone. 533 U. S., at 546–\n551. Unlike the District Court, which saw “the central\nquestion for purposes of pre-emption [as] whether the\nregulations create[d] a predicate legal duty based on\nsmoking and health,” id., at 537, the Court’s substantive\nexamination of the regulations under §5(b) included no\nmention of the Cipollone plurality’s “predicate duty” test.\nSee 533 U. S., at 546–551. Instead, the Court disagreed\nwith “the Attorney General’s narrow construction” of the\nstatute’s “ ‘based on smoking and health’ ” language, and\nconcluded that the regulations were pre-empted because\nthey were “motivated by” and “intertwined with” the\nconcerns about smoking and health. Id., at 547–548.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Reilly, therefore, cannot be reconciled with the Cipollone\nplurality’s interpretation of §5(b) of the Labeling Act. The\nregulations at issue in Reilly were enacted to implement a\nMassachusetts state law imposing a duty against unfair\nand deceptive trade practices—the same predicate duty\nasserted under the MUTPA in this case. 533 U. S., at 533.\nThe state-law duty at issue in Reilly was no less general\nthan the state-law duty at issue in this case or the state­\nlaw fraud claims confronted in Cipollone. Compare Mass.\nGen. Laws, ch. 93A, §2(a) (West 1996) (“Unfair methods of\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\nconduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared\nunlawful”), with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207 (Supp.\n2008) (“Unfair methods of competition and unfair or de­\nceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or\ncommerce are declared unlawful”), and Cipollone, supra,\nat 528 (explaining that the “predicate” of the plaintiff’s\nfraudulent misrepresentation claim was “a state-law duty\nnot to make false statements of material fact or to conceal\nsuch facts”). Faithful application of the Cipollone plurality\nopinion, therefore, would have required the Court in Reilly\nto uphold the regulations. Indeed, JUSTICE STEVENS\nargued as much in his dissent. 533 U. S., at 597 (noting\nthat “[n]ary a word in any of the three Cipollone opinions\nsupports the thesis that §5 should be interpreted to pre­\nempt state regulation of the location of signs advertising\ncigarettes”).\n   And yet, the majority today finds that Reilly and Cipol\nlone are perfectly compatible. It contends that, although\nthe regulations in question in Reilly “derived from a gen­\neral deceptive practices statute like the one at issue in this\ncase,” they were pre-empted because they “targeted adver­\ntising that tended to promote tobacco use by children\ninstead of prohibiting false or misleading statements.”\nAnte, at 12. According to the majority, that legal duty\ncontrasts with the regulations here, as “[t]he MUTPA says\n16              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nnothing about either ‘smoking’ or ‘health.’ ” Ante, at 13;\nsee also ante, at 10. But the Cipollone plurality expressly\nrejected any distinction between targeted regulations like\nthose in Reilly and general duties imposed by the common\nlaw. 505 U. S., at 522. In fact, the general duties underly­\ning the failure-to-warn and warning-neutralization claims\nin Cipollone—which the plurality found to be pre­\nempted—say nothing about smoking and health. Id., at\n524; see also id., at 553 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg­\nment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the duty\nto warn about a product’s dangers was not “specifically\ncrafted with an eye toward ‘smoking and health’ ”).\n  Accordingly, Reilly is better understood as establishing\nthat even a general duty can impose requirements or\nprohibitions based on smoking and health. Reilly weak­\nened the force of the Cipollone plurality’s “predicate duty”\napproach to the pre-emptive effect of §5(b) and cast doubt\non its continuing utility.\n                              D\n  Finally, the Cipollone plurality’s approach should be\ndiscarded because its “predicate duty” approach is unper­\nsuasive as an initial matter. In considering the warning­\nneutralization claim, for example, the Cipollone plurality\nasserted that the claim is predicated on a state-law prohi­\nbition against minimizing the health risks associated with\nsmoking. 505 U. S., at 527. The Court today reaffirms\nthis view. Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 13 (describing §5(b)\nas expressly pre-empting “rules . . . that are based on\nsmoking and health”). But every products liability action,\nincluding a failure-to-warn action, applies generally to all\nproducts. See Cipollone, supra, at 553 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.). Thus, the “duty” or “rule” involved in a failure-to-warn\nclaim is no more specific to smoking and health than is a\ncommon-law fraud claim based on the “duty” or “rule” not\nto use deceptive or misleading trade practices. Yet only\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                  17\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor the latter was the Cipollone plurality content to ignore\nthe context in which the claim is asserted. This shifting\nlevel of generality was identified as a logical weakness in\nthe original Cipollone plurality decision by a majority of\nthe Court, 505 U. S., at 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in\npart, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in\npart); id., at 553–554 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), and it re­\nmains equally unconvincing today.\n   It is therefore unsurprising that the Court’s defense of\nthe plurality’s confusing test is confined to one sentence\nand a footnote. See ante, at 13–14 (“While we again ac­\nknowledge that our analysis of these claims may lack\n‘theoretical elegance,’ we remain persuaded that it repre­\nsents ‘a fair understanding of congressional purpose’ ”\n(quoting Cipollone, supra, at 529–530, n. 27)); ante, at 10,\nn. 7. The majority instead argues that this approach “fails\nto explain why Congress would . . . permi[t] cigarette\nmanufacturers to engage in fraudulent advertising.” Ante,\nat 10, n. 7. But no explanation is necessary; the text\nspeaks for itself. Congress has pre-empted only those\nclaims that would impose “requirement[s] or prohibition[s]\nbased on smoking and health.” 15 U. S. C. §1334(b).\nThus, if cigarette manufacturers were to falsely advertise\ntheir products as “American-made,” or “the official ciga­\nrette of Major League Baseball,” state-law claims arising\nfrom that wrongful behavior would not be pre-empted.\n   Furthermore, contrary to the majority’s policy argu­\nments, faithful application of the statutory language does\nnot authorize fraudulent advertising with respect to smok­\ning and health.3 Any misleading promotional statements\n——————\n  3 The majority’s policy-based attack could just as easily be leveled\n\nagainst its own determination that the Labeling Act pre-empts failure­\nto-warn claims. But just as there is no basis in fact or law to contend\nthat the Labeling Act encourages the marketing of hazardous products\nwithout adequate warning labels, ante, at 10, n. 8, there is no basis\nto contend that the text of the Labeling Act permits fraudulent\n18                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor cigarettes remain subject to federal regulatory over­\nsight under the Labeling Act. See §1336. The relevant\nquestion thus is not whether “petitioners will be prohib­\nited from selling as ‘light’ or ‘low tar’ only those cigarettes\nthat are not actually light and do not actually deliver less\ntar and nicotine.” Ante, at 12, n. 10. Rather, the issue is\nwhether the Labeling Act allows regulators and juries to\ndecide, on a state-by-state basis, whether petitioners’ light\nand low-tar descriptors were in fact fraudulent, or instead\nwhether §5(b) charged the Federal Government with\nreaching a comprehensive judgment with respect to this\nquestion.\n   Congress chose a uniform federal standard. Under the\nLabeling Act, Congress “establish[ed] a comprehensive\nFederal Program to deal with cigarette labeling and ad­\nvertising,” 15 U. S. C. §1331, so that “commerce and the\nnational economy may . . . not [be] impeded by diverse,\nnonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertis­\ning regulations with respect to any relationship between\nsmoking and health,” §1331(2)(B).4 The majority’s dis­\ntorted interpretation of §5(b) defeats this express congres­\nsional purpose, opening the door to an untold number of\ndeceptive-practices lawsuits across the country.           The\nquestion whether marketing a light cigarette is “ ‘misrep­\nresentative’ ” in light of compensatory behavior “would\nalmost certainly be answered differently from State to\nState.” Cipollone, supra, 505 U. S., at 553 (opinion of\n\n——————\nadvertising.\n  4 The majority contends that the relatively constrained enforcement\n\npower of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1970 undermines any\nargument that Congress intended the Labeling Act to prevent States\nfrom regulating deceptive advertising and marketing of cigarettes.\nAnte, at 8, n. 6. I am unwilling to rely on the majority’s perception of\nthe relative power of the FTC in 1970 to ignore Congress’ stated pur­\npose in enacting the Labeling Act and the plain meaning of the Act’s\nexpress pre-emption provision.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

This will inevitably result in the nonuniform\nimposition of liability for the marketing of light and/or\nlow-tar cigarettes—the precise problem that Congress\nintended §5(b) to remedy.\n   In light of these serious flaws in the majority’s ap­\nproach, even if the Cipollone plurality opinion were bind­\ning precedent, the Court “should not hesitate to allow our\nprecedent to yield to the true meaning of an Act of Con­\ngress when our statutory precedent is ‘unworkable’ or\n‘badly reasoned.’ ” Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 402\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Holder v. Hall,\n512 U. S. 874, 936 (1994) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment), in turn quoting Payne, 501 U.

See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 14–33. Instead, it addressed only the question of implied pre­\nemption, an issue I do not reach because of my resolution of the ques­\ntion on express pre-emption.\n20              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

Respondents, longtime smokers of\nMarlboro Lights, claim that they have suffered an injury\nas a result of petitioners’ decision to advertise these ciga­\nrettes as “light” and/or “low-tar and low nicotine products.”\n436 F. Supp. 2d, at 144–145. They claim that petitioners\nmarketed their cigarettes as “light” and/or “low-tar and\nlow-nicotine products” despite knowledge that light­\ncigarette smokers would engage in compensatory behavior\ncausing them to inhale at least as much tar and nicotine\nas smokers of regular cigarettes. Ibid. Respondents thus\nallege that they were misled into thinking that they were\ngaining a health advantage by smoking the light ciga­\nrettes, ibid., and, as a result, petitioners’ conduct was an\n“unfair or deceptive act or practice” under the MUTPA.\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207; 436 F. Supp. 2d, at 133.\n   Respondents’ claims seek to impose liability on petition­\ners because of the effect that smoking light cigarettes had\non their health. The alleged misrepresentation here—that\n“light” and “low-tar” cigarettes are not as healthy as ad­\nvertised—is actionable only because of the effect that\nsmoking light and low-tar cigarettes had on respondents’\nhealth. Otherwise, any alleged misrepresentation about\nthe effect of the cigarettes on health would be immaterial\nfor purposes of the MUTPA and would not be the source of\nthe injuries that provided the impetus for the class-action\nlawsuit.

This is exactly the type of lawsuit that is pre-empted\nby the Labeling Act. Cf. Rowe, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

See ante, at 11, n. 9. If the claims arise from\nidentical conduct, the claims impose the same requirement\nor prohibition with respect to that conduct. And when\nthat allegedly wrongful conduct involves misleading\nstatements about the health effects of smoking a particu­\nlar brand of cigarette, the liability and resulting require­\nment or prohibition are, by definition, based on smoking\nand health.\n   Finally, at oral argument, respondents argued that their\nclaims do not impose requirements based on smoking and\nhealth because the damages they seek to recover are not\n——————\n  6 The majority’s observation that no warning-neutralization claim is\n\nat issue in this case, ante, at 11 n. 9, misses the point. The principal\nweakness in the Cipollone plurality’s logic is not its distinction between\nclaims for warning neutralization and claims for fraud. It is the fact\nthat the predicate duty underlying New Jersey’s products liability law,\nfrom which the majority now claims the warning-neutralization claim\nderived, see ante, at 11, n. 8, was no more specific to smoking and\nhealth than the predicate duty underlying the fraud claim, see Cipol\nlone, 505 U. S., at 552–553 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“Each duty tran­\nscends the relationship between the cigarette companies and cigarette\nsmokers; neither duty was specifically crafted with an eye toward\n‘smoking and health’ ”); id., at 543 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also\nsupra, at 16. Thus, the products-liability and the fraud claims must\nstand or fall together. The majority’s refusal to address the logical\ninconsistency of its approach remains as glaring today as it was in\nCipollone.\n22              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

But\nthe requirement or prohibition covered by §5(b) is created\nby the imposition of liability for particular conduct—here,\nthe way in which petitioners marketed “light” and “low­\ntar,” and “low-nicotine” cigarettes—not by the manner in\nwhich respondents have chosen to measure their damages.\nNo matter how respondents characterize their damages\nclaim, they have not been injured for purposes of the\nMUTPA, and thus cannot recover, unless their decision to\npurchase the cigarettes had a negative effect on their\nhealth.\n  In any event, respondents sought “such injunctive relief\nas may be appropriate” in this case. App. 42a. The\nMUTPA specifically authorizes “other equitable relief,\nincluding an injunction,” to remedy unfair or deceptive\ntrade practices. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §213(1) (West\n2002). And a court-crafted injunction prohibiting petition­\ners from marketing light cigarettes would be no less a\nrequirement or prohibition than the regulations found to\nbe pre-empted in Reilly. In the end, no matter what form\nthe remedy takes, the liability with respect to the specific\nclaim still creates the requirement or prohibition. When\nthat liability is necessarily premised on the effects of\nsmoking on health, as respondents’ claims are here, the\ncivil action is pre-empted by §5(b) of the Labeling Act.\n                            IV\n   The Court today elects to convert the Cipollone plural­\nity opinion into binding law, notwithstanding its weak­\nened doctrinal foundation, its atextual construction of the\nstatute, and the lower courts’ inability to apply its meth­\nodology.

Argued October 6, 2008—Decided December 15, 2008\nRespondents, smokers of petitioners’ “light” cigarettes, filed suit, alleg\n  ing that petitioners violated the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act\n  (MUTPA) by fraudulently advertising that their “light” cigarettes de\n  livered less tar and nicotine than regular brands. The District Court\n  granted summary judgment for petitioners, finding the state-law\n  claim pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising\n  Act (Labeling Act). The First Circuit reversed, holding that the La\n  beling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empts respondents’\n  fraud claim.\nHeld: Neither the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provision nor the Federal\n Trade Commission’s actions in this field pre-empt respondents’ state\n law fraud claim. Pp. 5–20.\n    (a) Congress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a statute’s\n express language or through its structure and purpose. See Jones v.\n Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525.

The Labeling\n Act’s stated purposes are to inform the public of the health risks of\n smoking while protecting commerce and the economy from the ill ef\n fects of nonuniform requirements to the extent consistent with the\n first goal. Although fidelity to these purposes does not demand the\n pre-emption of state fraud rules, the principal question here is\n whether that result is nevertheless required by 15 U. S. C. §1334(b),\n which provides that “[n]o requirement or prohibition based on smok\n ing and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the\n advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are\n labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.” Pp. 5–9.\n2                    ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

S. 504, and\n    Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, the phrase “based on\n    smoking and health” modifies the state-law rule at issue rather than\n    a particular application of that rule. The Cipollone plurality con\n    cluded that “the phrase ‘based on smoking and health’ fairly but nar\n    rowly construed” did not pre-empt the Cipollone plaintiff’s common\n    law claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently misrepre\n    sented and concealed a material fact, because the claim alleged a vio\n    lation of a duty not to deceive—a duty that is not “based on” smoking\n    and health. 505 U. S., at 528–529. Respondents here also allege a\n    violation of the duty not to deceive as codified in the MUTPA, which,\n    like the common-law duty in Cipollone, has nothing to do with smok\n    ing and health. Respondents’ claim is not analogous to the “warning\n    neutralization” claim found to be pre-empted in Cipollone. Reilly is\n    consistent with Cipollone’s analysis. This Court disagrees with peti\n    tioners’ alternative argument that the express pre-emption frame\n    work of Cipollone and Reilly should be rejected. American Airlines,\n    Inc. v.

Specifically, they allege that\npetitioners’ advertising fraudulently conveyed the mes\nsage that their “light” cigarettes deliver less tar and nico\ntine to consumers than regular brands despite petitioners’\nknowledge that the message was untrue. Petitioners deny\nthe charge, asserting that their advertisements were\nfactually accurate. The merits of the dispute are not\nbefore us because the District Court entered summary\njudgment in favor of petitioners on the ground that re\nspondents’ state-law claim is pre-empted by the Federal\nCigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, as amended\n(Labeling Act). The Court of Appeals reversed that judg\nment, and we granted certiorari to review its holding that\nthe Labeling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre\nempts respondents’ fraud claim. We affirm.\n2                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n  Respondents are Maine residents and longtime smokers\nof Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes,\nwhich are manufactured by petitioners. Invoking the\ndiversity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court, re\nspondents filed a complaint alleging that petitioners delib\nerately deceived them about the true and harmful nature\nof “light” cigarettes in violation of the MUTPA, Me. Rev.\nStat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207 (Supp. 2008).1 Respondents claim\nthat petitioners fraudulently marketed their cigarettes as\nbeing “light” and containing “ ‘[l]owered [t]ar and\n[n]icotine’ ” to convey to consumers that they deliver less\ntar and nicotine and are therefore less harmful than regu\nlar cigarettes. App. 28a–29a.\n  Respondents acknowledge that testing pursuant to the\nCambridge Filter Method2 indicates that tar and nicotine\nyields of Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights are lower\nthan those of regular cigarettes. Id., at 30a. Respondents\nallege, however, that petitioners have known at all rele\nvant times that human smokers unconsciously engage in\ncompensatory behaviors not registered by Cambridge\nFilter Method testing that negate the effect of the tar- and\n——————\n   1 The MUTPA provides, as relevant, that “[u]nfair methods of compe\n\ntition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any\ntrade or commerce are declared unlawful.” §207. In construing that\nsection, courts are to “be guided by the interpretations given by the\nFederal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to Section 45(a)(1)\nof the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 United States Code 45(a)(1)),\nas from time to time amended.” §207(1).\n   2 The Cambridge Filter Method weighs and measures the tar and\n\nnicotine collected by a smoking machine that takes 35 milliliter puffs of\ntwo seconds’ duration every 60 seconds until the cigarette is smoked to\na specified butt length. App. 294a, 668a. As discussed below, the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC or Commission) signaled in 1966 that\nthe Cambridge Filter Method was an acceptable means of measuring\nthe tar and nicotine content of cigarettes, but it never required manu\nfacturers to publish test results in their advertisements.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnicotine-reducing features of “light” cigarettes. Id., at\n30a–31a. By covering filter ventilation holes with their\nlips or fingers, taking larger or more frequent puffs, and\nholding the smoke in their lungs for a longer period of\ntime, smokers of “light” cigarettes unknowingly inhale as\nmuch tar and nicotine as do smokers of regular cigarettes.\nIbid. “Light” cigarettes are in fact more harmful because\nthe increased ventilation that results from their unique\ndesign features produces smoke that is more mutagenic\nper milligram of tar than the smoke of regular cigarettes.\nId., at 31a–32a. Respondents claim that petitioners vio\nlated the MUTPA by fraudulently concealing that infor\nmation and by affirmatively representing, through the use\nof “light” and “lowered tar and nicotine” descriptors, that\ntheir cigarettes would pose fewer health risks. Id., at 32a,\n33a.\n   Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground\nthat the Labeling Act, 15 U. S. C. §1334(b), expressly pre\nempts respondents’ state-law cause of action. Relying on\nour decisions in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S.\n504 (1992), and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S.\n525 (2001), the District Court concluded that respondents’\nMUTPA claim is pre-empted. The court recast respon\ndents’ claim as a failure-to-warn or warning neutralization\nclaim of the kind pre-empted in Cipollone: The claim\ncharges petitioners with “produc[ing] a product it knew\ncontained hidden risks . . . not apparent or known to the\nconsumer”—a claim that “runs to what [petitioners] actu\nally said about Lights and what [respondents] claim they\nshould have said.” 436 F. Supp. 2d 132, 151 (Me. 2006).\nAnd the difference between what petitioners said and\nwhat respondents would have them say is “ ‘intertwined\nwith the concern about cigarette smoking and health.’ ”\nId., at 153 (quoting Reilly, 533 U. S., at 548). The District\nCourt thus concluded that respondents’ claim rests on a\nstate-law requirement based on smoking and health of\n4               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecisely the kind that §1334(b) pre-empts, and it granted\nsummary judgment for petitioners.\n  Respondents appealed, and the Court of Appeals re\nversed. The Court of Appeals first rejected the District\nCourt’s characterization of respondents’ claim as a warn\ning neutralization claim akin to the pre-empted claim in\nCipollone. 501 F. 3d 29, 37, 40 (CA1 2007). Instead, the\ncourt concluded that respondents’ claim is in substance a\nfraud claim that alleges that petitioners falsely repre\nsented their cigarettes as “light” or having “lowered tar\nand nicotine” even though they deliver to smokers the\nsame quantities of those components as do regular ciga\nrettes. Id., at 36. “The fact that these alleged misrepre\nsentations were unaccompanied by additional statements\nin the nature of a warning does not transform the claimed\nfraud into failure to warn” or warning neutralization. Id.,\nat 42–43. Finding respondents’ claim indistinguishable\nfrom the non-pre-empted fraud claim at issue in Cipollone,\nthe Court of Appeals held that it is not expressly pre\nempted. The court also rejected petitioners’ argument\nthat respondents’ claim is impliedly pre-empted because\ntheir success on that claim would stand as an obstacle to\nthe purported policy of the FTC allowing the use of de\nscriptive terms that convey Cambridge Filter Method test\nresults. Accordingly, it reversed the judgment of the\nDistrict Court.\n  In concluding that respondents’ claim is not expressly\npre-empted, the Court of Appeals considered and rejected\nthe Fifth Circuit’s reasoning in a similar case. 501 F. 3d,\nat 45. Unlike the court below, the Fifth Circuit likened\nthe plaintiffs’ challenge to the use of “light” descriptors to\nCipollone’s warning neutralization claim and thus found it\nexpressly pre-empted. Brown v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 479 F. 3d 383, 392–393 (2007). We granted\nthe petition for certiorari to resolve this apparent conflict.\n552 U.

Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981).\n   Our inquiry into the scope of a statute’s pre-emptive\neffect is guided by the rule that “ ‘[t]he purpose of Congress\nis the ultimate touchstone’ in every pre-emption case.”\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485 (1996) (quoting\nRetail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103 (1963)).\nCongress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a\nstatute’s express language or through its structure and\npurpose. See Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519,\n525 (1977). If a federal law contains an express pre\nemption clause, it does not immediately end the inquiry\nbecause the question of the substance and scope of Con\ngress’ displacement of state law still remains. Pre\nemptive intent may also be inferred if the scope of the\nstatute indicates that Congress intended federal law to\noccupy the legislative field, or if there is an actual conflict\nbetween state and federal law. Freightliner Corp. v.\nMyrick, 514 U. S. 280, 287 (1995).\n   When addressing questions of express or implied pre\nemption, we begin our analysis “with the assumption that\nthe historic police powers of the States [are] not to be\nsuperseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear\nand manifest purpose of Congress.” Rice v. Santa Fe\nElevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). That assump\ntion applies with particular force when Congress has\nlegislated in a field traditionally occupied by the States.\nLohr, 518 U. S., at 485; see also Reilly, 533 U. S., at 541–\n542 (“Because ‘federal law is said to bar state action in [a]\n6                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

Thus, when the text of a\npre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one plausi\nble reading, courts ordinarily “accept the reading that\ndisfavors pre-emption.” Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,\n544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005).\n   Congress enacted the Labeling Act in 19653 in response\nto the Surgeon General’s determination that cigarette\nsmoking is harmful to health. The Act required that every\npackage of cigarettes sold in the United States contain a\nconspicuous warning, and it pre-empted state-law positive\nenactments that added to the federally prescribed warn\ning. 79 Stat. 283. Congress amended the Labeling Act a\nfew years later by enacting the Public Health Cigarette\nSmoking Act of 1969.4 The amendments strengthened the\nlanguage of the prescribed warning, 84 Stat. 88, and pro\nhibited cigarette advertising in “any medium of electronic\ncommunication subject to [FCC] jurisdiction,” id., at 89.\nThey also broadened the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provi\nsion. See Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion)\n(discussing the difference in scope of the pre-emption\nclauses of the 1965 and 1969 Acts). The Labeling Act has\nsince been amended further to require cigarette manufac\nturers to include four more explicit warnings in their\npackaging and advertisements on a rotating basis.5\n   The stated purpose of the Labeling Act is\n       “to establish a comprehensive Federal program to deal\n\n——————\n    3 79\n       Stat. 282.\n    4 Pub.\n         L. 91–222, 84 Stat. 87.

S. C.\n    §1331.\nThe requirement that cigarette manufacturers include in\ntheir packaging and advertising the precise warnings\nmandated by Congress furthers the Act’s first purpose.\nAnd the Act’s pre-emption provisions promote its second\npurpose.\n  As amended, the Labeling Act contains two express pre\nemption provisions. Section 5(a) protects cigarette manu\nfacturers from inconsistent state labeling laws by prohibit\ning the requirement of additional statements relating to\nsmoking and health on cigarette packages. 15 U. S. C.\n§1334(a). Section 5(b), which is at issue in this case,\nprovides that “[n]o requirement or prohibition based on\nsmoking and health shall be imposed under State law with\nrespect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\nthe packages of which are labeled in conformity with the\nprovisions of this chapter.” §1334(b).\n  Together, the labeling requirement and pre-emption\nprovisions express Congress’ determination that the pre\nscribed federal warnings are both necessary and sufficient\nto achieve its purpose of informing the public of the health\nconsequences of smoking. Because Congress has decided\n8                   ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat no additional warning statement is needed to attain\nthat goal, States may not impede commerce in cigarettes\nby enforcing rules that are based on an assumption that\nthe federal warnings are inadequate. Although both of the\nAct’s purposes are furthered by prohibiting States from\nsupplementing the federally prescribed warning, neither\nwould be served by limiting the States’ authority to pro\nhibit deceptive statements in cigarette advertising. Peti\ntioners acknowledge that “Congress had no intention of\ninsulating tobacco companies from liability for inaccurate\nstatements about the relationship between smoking and\nhealth.” Brief for Petitioners 28. But they maintain that\nCongress could not have intended to permit the enforce\nment of state fraud rules because doing so would defeat\nthe Labeling Act’s purpose of preventing nonuniform state\nwarning requirements. 15 U. S. C. §1331.6 As we ob\n——————\n   6 Petitioners also urge us to find support for their claim that Congress\n\ngave the FTC exclusive authority to police deceptive health-related\nclaims in cigarette advertising in what they refer to as the Labeling\nAct’s “saving clause.” The clause provides that, apart from the warning\nrequirement, nothing in the Act “shall be construed to limit, restrict,\nexpand, or otherwise affect the authority of the Federal Trade Commis\nsion with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the advertis\ning of cigarettes.” §1336. A plurality of this Court has previously read\nthis clause to “indicat[e] that Congress intended the phrase ‘relating to\nsmoking and health’ . . . to be construed narrowly, so as not to pro\nscribe the regulation of deceptive advertising.” Cipollone v. Liggett\nGroup, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 528–529 (1992). Nothing in the clause\nsuggests that Congress meant to proscribe the States’ historic regula\ntion of deceptive advertising practices. The FTC has long depended on\ncooperative state regulation to achieve its mission because, although\none of the smallest administrative agencies, it is charged with policing\nan enormous amount of activity. See 1 S. Kanwit, Federal Trade\nCommission §§1:1, 1:2 (2004 ed. and Supp. 2008). Moreover, when the\nLabeling Act was amended in 1969 it was not even clear that the FTC\npossessed rulemaking authority, see 84 Stat. 89, making it highly\nunlikely that Congress would have intended to assign exclusively to\nthe FTC the substantial task of overseeing deceptive practices in\ncigarette advertisements.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nserved in Cipollone, however, fraud claims “rely only on a\nsingle, uniform standard: falsity.” 505 U. S., at 529 (plu\nrality opinion).\n   Although it is clear that fidelity to the Act’s purposes\ndoes not demand the pre-emption of state fraud rules, the\nprincipal question that we must decide is whether the text\nof §1334(b) nevertheless requires that result.\n                               III\n  We have construed the operative phrases of §1334(b) in\ntwo prior cases: Cipollone, 505 U. S. 504, and Reilly, 533\nU. S. 525. On both occasions we recognized that the\nphrase “based on smoking and health” modifies the state\nlaw rule at issue rather than a particular application of\nthat rule.\n  In Cipollone, the plurality, which consisted of Chief\nJustice Rehnquist and Justices White, O’Connor, and\nSTEVENS, read the pre-emption provision in the 1969\namendments to the Labeling Act to pre-empt common-law\nrules as well as positive enactments. Unlike Justices\nBlackmun, KENNEDY, and SOUTER, the plurality con\ncluded that the provision does not preclude all common\nlaw claims that have some relationship to smoking and\nhealth. 505 U. S., at 521–523. To determine whether a\nparticular common-law claim is pre-empted, the plurality\ninquired “whether the legal duty that is the predicate of\nthe common-law damages action constitutes a ‘require\nment or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . with\nrespect to . . . advertising or promotion,’ giving that clause\na fair but narrow reading.” Id., at 524.\n  Applying this standard, the plurality held that the\nplaintiff’s claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudu\nlently misrepresented and concealed a material fact was\nnot pre-empted. That claim alleged a violation of the\nmanufacturers’ duty not to deceive—a duty that is not\n“based on” smoking and health. Id., at 528–529. Respon\n10                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndents in this case also allege a violation of the duty not to\ndeceive as that duty is codified in the MUTPA. The duty\ncodified in that state statute, like the duty imposed by the\nstate common-law rule at issue in Cipollone, has nothing\nto do with smoking and health.7\n   Petitioners endeavor to distance themselves from that\nholding by arguing that respondents’ claim is more analo\ngous to the “warning neutralization” claim found to be pre\nempted in Cipollone. Although the plurality understood\nthe plaintiff to have presented that claim as a “theory of\nfraudulent misrepresentation,” id., at 528, the gravamen\nof the claim was the defendants’ failure to warn, as it was\n“predicated on a state-law prohibition against statements\nin advertising and promotional materials that tend to\nminimize the health hazards associated with smoking,”\nid., at 527. Thus understood, the Cipollone plurality’s\nanalysis of the warning neutralization claim has no appli\ncation in this case.8\n\n——————\n   7 In his dissent, JUSTICE THOMAS criticizes our reliance on the plural\n\nity opinion in Cipollone, post, at 6–8, 14–19, 22, and advocates adopting\nthe analysis set forth by JUSTICE SCALIA in his opinion concurring in the\njudgment in part and dissenting in part in that case, post, at 3–6, 19–\n21. But JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach was rejected by seven Members of\nthe Court, and in the almost 17 years since Cipollone was decided\nCongress has done nothing to indicate its approval of that approach.\nMoreover, JUSTICE THOMAS fails to explain why Congress would have\nintended the result that JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach would produce—\nnamely, permitting cigarette manufacturers to engage in fraudulent\nadvertising. As a majority of the Court concluded in Cipollone, nothing\nin the Labeling Act’s language or purpose supports that result.\n   8 The Cipollone plurality further stated that the warning neutraliza\n\ntion claim was “merely the converse of a state-law requirement that\nwarnings be included in advertising and promotional materials,” 505\nU. S., at 527, evincing the plurality’s recognition that warning neutrali\nzation and failure-to-warn claims are two sides of the same coin.\nJUSTICE THOMAS’ criticism of the plurality’s treatment of the failure-to\nwarn claim, post, at 16, is beside the point, as no such claim is at issue\nin this litigation.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

But the extent of the\nfalsehood alleged does not alter the nature of the claim.\nNothing in the Labeling Act’s text or purpose or in the\nplurality opinion in Cipollone suggests that whether a\nclaim is pre-empted turns in any way on the distinction\nbetween misleading and inherently false statements.\nPetitioners’ misunderstanding is the same one that led the\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, when confronted\nwith a “light” descriptors claim, to reach a result at odds\nwith the Court of Appeals’ decision in this case. See\nBrown, 479 F. 3d, at 391–393. Certainly, the extent of the\nfalsehood alleged may bear on whether a plaintiff can\nprove her fraud claim, but the merits of respondents’ claim\nare not before us.\n  Once that erroneous distinction is set aside, it is clear\nthat our holding in Cipollone that the common-law fraud\nclaim was not pre-empted is directly applicable to the\nstatutory claim at issue in this case. As was true of the\nclaim in Cipollone, respondents’ claim that the deceptive\nstatements “light” and “lowered tar and nicotine” induced\nthem to purchase petitioners’ product alleges a breach of\nthe duty not to deceive.9 To be sure, the presence of the\nfederally mandated warnings may bear on the materiality\nof petitioners’ allegedly fraudulent statements, “but that\npossibility does not change [respondents’] case from one\n——————\n  9 As the Court of Appeals observed, respondents’ allegations regard\n\ning petitioners’ use of the statements “light” and “lowered tar and\nnicotine” could also support a warning neutralization claim. But\nrespondents did not bring such a claim, and the fact that they could\nhave does not, as petitioners suggest, elevate form over substance.\nThere is nothing new in the recognition that the same conduct might\nviolate multiple proscriptions.\n12                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nabout the statements into one about the warnings.” 501\nF. 3d, at 44.10\n  Our decision in Reilly is consistent with Cipollone’s\nanalysis. Reilly involved regulations promulgated by the\nMassachusetts attorney general “ ‘in order to address the\nincidence of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use\nby children under legal age . . . [and] in order to prevent\naccess to such products by underage customers.’ ” 533\nU. S., at 533 (quoting 940 Code Mass. Regs. §21.01 (2000)).\nThe regulations did not pertain to the content of any\nadvertising; rather, they placed a variety of restrictions on\ncertain cigarette sales and the location of outdoor and\npoint-of-sale cigarette advertising. The attorney general\npromulgated those restrictions pursuant to his statutory\nauthority to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices.\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 93A, §2 (West 1996). But although\nthe attorney general’s authority derived from a general\ndeceptive practices statute like the one at issue in this\ncase, the challenged regulations targeted advertising that\ntended to promote tobacco use by children instead of pro\nhibiting false or misleading statements. Thus, whereas\nthe “prohibition” in Cipollone was the common-law fraud\nrule, the “prohibitions” in Reilly were the targeted regula\n——————\n  10 JUSTICE  THOMAS contends that respondents’ fraud claim must be\npre-empted because “[a] judgment in [their] favor will . . . result in a\n‘requirement’ that petitioners represent the effects of smoking on\nhealth in a particular way in their advertising and promotion of light\ncigarettes.” Post, at 3. He further asserts that “respondents seek to\nrequire the cigarette manufacturers to provide additional warnings\nabout compensatory behavior, or to prohibit them from selling these\nproducts with the ‘light’ or ‘low-tar’ descriptors.” Post, at 20. But this\nmischaracterizes the relief respondents seek. If respondents prevail at\ntrial, petitioners will be prohibited from selling as “light” or “low tar”\nonly those cigarettes that are not actually light and do not actually\ndeliver less tar and nicotine. Barring intervening federal regulation,\npetitioners would remain free to make nonfraudulent use of the “light”\nand “low-tar” descriptors.\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Accordingly, our holding in Reilly that the regula\ntions were pre-empted provides no support for an argu\nment that a general prohibition of deceptive practices is\n“based on” the harm caused by the specific kind of decep\ntion to which the prohibition is applied in a given case.\n   It is true, as petitioners argue, that the appeal of their\nadvertising is based on the relationship between smoking\nand health. And although respondents have expressly\nrepudiated any claim for damages for personal injuries,\nsee App. 26a, their actual injuries likely encompass harms\nto health as well as the monetary injuries they allege.\nThese arguments are unavailing, however, because the\ntext of §1334(b) does not refer to harms related to smoking\nand health. Rather, it pre-empts only requirements and\nprohibitions—i.e., rules—that are based on smoking and\nhealth. The MUTPA says nothing about either “smoking”\nor “health.” It is a general rule that creates a duty not to\ndeceive and is therefore unlike the regulations at issue in\nReilly.11\n   Petitioners argue in the alternative that we should\nreject the express pre-emption framework established by\nthe Cipollone plurality and relied on by the Court in\nReilly. In so doing, they invoke the reasons set forth in\nthe separate opinions of Justice Blackmun (who especially\ncriticized the plurality’s holding that the failure-to-warn\nclaim was pre-empted) and JUSTICE SCALIA (who argued\nthat the fraud claim also should be pre-empted). While we\nagain acknowledge that our analysis of these claims may\nlack “theoretical elegance,” we remain persuaded that it\n——————\n  11 In implementing the MUTPA, neither the state legislature nor the\n\nstate attorney general has enacted a set of special rules or guidelines\ntargeted at cigarette advertising. As we noted in Cipollone, it was the\nthreatened enactment of new state warning requirements rather than\nthe enforcement of pre-existing general prohibitions against deceptive\npractices that prompted congressional action in 1969. 505 U. S., at 515,\nand n. 11.\n14                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrepresents “a fair understanding of congressional pur\npose.” Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 529–530, n. 27 (plurality\nopinion).\n   Petitioners also contend that the plurality opinion is\ninconsistent with our decisions in American Airlines, Inc.\nv. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219 (1995), and Riegel v. Medtronic,\nInc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008). Both cases, however, are inap\nposite—the first because it involved a pre-emption provi\nsion much broader than the Labeling Act’s, and the second\nbecause it involved precisely the type of state rule that\nCongress had intended to pre-empt.\n   At issue in Wolens was the pre-emptive effect of the\nAirline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 49 U. S. C.\nApp. §1305(a)(1) (1988 ed.), which prohibits States from\nenacting or enforcing any law “relating to rates, routes, or\nservices of any air carrier.” The plaintiffs in that case\nsought to bring a claim under the Illinois Consumer Fraud\nand Deceptive Business Practices Act, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch.\n815, §505 (West 1992). Our conclusion that the state-law\nclaim was pre-empted turned on the unusual breadth of\nthe ADA’s pre-emption provision. We had previously held\nthat the meaning of the key phrase in the ADA’s pre\nemption provision, “ ‘relating to rates, routes, or services,’ ”\nis a broad one. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504\nU. S. 374, 383–384 (1992) (emphasis added). Relying on\nprecedents construing the pre-emptive effect of the same\nphrase in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974, 29 U. S. C. §1144(a), we concluded that the phrase\n“relating to” indicates Congress’ intent to pre-empt a large\narea of state law to further its purpose of deregulating the\nairline industry. 504 U. S., at 383–384.12 Unquestionably,\n——————\n  12 Petitioners also point to Morales as evidence that our decision in\n\nCipollone was wrong. But Morales predated Cipollone, and it is in any\nevent even more easily distinguishable from this case than American\nAirlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S 219 (1995). At issue in Morales were\nguidelines regarding the form and substance of airline fare advertising\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe phrase “relating to” has a broader scope than the\nLabeling Act’s reference to rules “based on” smoking and\nhealth; whereas “relating to” is synonymous with “having\na connection with,” id., at 384, “based on” describes a more\ndirect relationship, see Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr,\n551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 13) (“In common talk,\nthe phrase ‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relation\nship and thus a necessary logical condition”).\n  Petitioners’ reliance on Riegel is similarly misplaced.\nThe plaintiffs in Riegel sought to bring common-law de\nsign, manufacturing, and labeling defect claims against\nthe manufacturer of a faulty catheter. The case presented\nthe question whether those claims were expressly pre\nempted by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976\n(MDA), 21 U. S. C. §360c et seq. The MDA’s pre-emption\nclause provides that no State “ ‘may establish or continue\nin effect with respect to a device . . . any requirement’\nrelating to safety or effectiveness that is different from, or\nin addition to, federal requirements.” Riegel, 552 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting 21 U. S. C. §360k(a); emphasis\ndeleted).\n  The catheter at issue in Riegel had received premarket\napproval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nWe concluded that premarket approval imposes “require\nment[s] relating to safety [and] effectiveness” because the\nFDA requires a device that has received premarket ap\nproval to be made with almost no design, manufacturing,\nor labeling deviations from the specifications in its ap\nproved application.       The plaintiffs’ products liability\n——————\nimplemented by the National Association of Attorneys General to give\ncontent to state deceptive practices rules. 504 U. S., at 379. Like the\nregulations at issue in Reilly, the guidelines were industry-specific\ndirectives that targeted the subject matter made off-limits by the ADA’s\nexpress pre-emption provisions. See also Rowe v. New Hampshire\nMotor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. ___ (2008) (holding that targeted ground\ncarrier regulations were pre-empted by a statute modeled on the ADA).\n16              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaims fell within the core of the MDA’s pre-emption pro\nvision because they sought to impose different require\nments on precisely those aspects of the device that the\nFDA had approved. Unlike the Cipollone plaintiff’s fraud\nclaim, which fell outside of the Labeling Act’s pre-emptive\nreach because it did not seek to impose a prohibition\n“based on smoking and health,” the Riegel plaintiffs’ com\nmon-law products liability claims unquestionably sought\nto enforce “requirement[s] relating to safety or effective\nness” under the MDA. That the “relating to” language of\nthe MDA’s pre-emption provision is, like the ADA’s, much\nbroader than the operative language of the Labeling Act\nprovides an additional basis for distinguishing Riegel.\nThus, contrary to petitioners’ suggestion, Riegel is entirely\nconsistent with our holding in Cipollone.\n  In sum, we conclude now, as the plurality did in Cipol\nlone, that “the phrase ‘based on smoking and health’ fairly\nbut narrowly construed does not encompass the more\ngeneral duty not to make fraudulent statements.” 505\nU. S., at 529.\n                            IV\n   As an alternative to their express pre-emption argu\nment, petitioners contend that respondents’ claim is impli\nedly pre-empted because, if allowed to proceed, it would\npresent an obstacle to a longstanding policy of the FTC.\nAccording to petitioners, the FTC has for decades pro\nmoted the development and consumption of low tar ciga\nrettes and has encouraged consumers to rely on represen\ntations of tar and nicotine content based on Cambridge\nFilter Method testing in choosing among cigarette brands.\nEven if such a regulatory policy could provide a basis for\nobstacle pre-emption, petitioners’ description of the FTC’s\nactions in this regard are inaccurate. The Government\nitself disavows any policy authorizing the use of “light”\nand “low tar” descriptors. Brief for United States as\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmicus Curiae 16–33.\n  In 1966, following the publication of the Surgeon Gen\neral’s report on smoking and health, the FTC issued an\nindustry guidance stating its view that “a factual state\nment of the tar and nicotine content (expressed in milli\ngrams) of the mainstream smoke from a cigarette,” as\nmeasured by Cambridge Filter Method testing, would not\nviolate the FTC Act. App. 478a. The Commission made\nclear, however, that the guidance applied only to factual\nassertions of tar and nicotine yields and did not invite\n“collateral representations . . . made, expressly or by im\nplication, as to reduction or elimination of health haz\nards.” Id., at 479a. A year later, the FTC reiterated its\nposition in a letter to the National Association of Broad\ncasters. The letter explained that, as a “general rule,” the\nCommission would not challenge statements of tar and\nnicotine content when “they are shown to be accurate and\nfully substantiated by tests conducted in accordance with\nthe [Cambridge Filter Method].” Id., at 368a. In 1970, the\nFTC considered providing further guidance, proposing a\nrule that would have required manufacturers to disclose\ntar and nicotine yields as measured by Cambridge Filter\nMethod testing. 35 Fed. Reg. 12671. The leading ciga\nrette manufacturers responded by submitting a voluntary\nagreement under which they would disclose tar and nico\ntine content in their advertising, App. 899a–900a, and the\nFTC suspended its rulemaking, 36 Fed. Reg. 784 (1971).\n  Based on these events, petitioners assert that “the FTC\nhas required tobacco companies to disclose tar and nico\ntine yields in cigarette advertising using a government\nmandated testing methodology and has authorized them\nto use descriptors as shorthand references to those nu\nmerical test results.” Brief for Petitioners 2 (emphasis in\noriginal). As the foregoing history shows, however, the\nFTC has in fact never required that cigarette manufactur\ners disclose tar and nicotine yields, nor has it condoned\n18                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrepresentations of those yields through the use of “light”\nor “low tar” descriptors.\n   Subsequent Commission actions further undermine\npetitioners’ claim. After the tobacco companies agreed to\nreport tar and nicotine yields as measured by the Cam\nbridge Filter Method, the FTC continued to police ciga\nrette companies’ misleading use of test results. In 1983,\nthe FTC responded to findings that tar and nicotine yields\nfor Barclay cigarettes obtained through Cambridge Filter\nMethod testing were deceptive because the cigarettes in\nfact delivered disproportionately more tar to smokers than\nother cigarettes with similar Cambridge Filter Method\nratings. 48 Fed. Reg. 15954. And in 1995, the FTC found\nthat a manufacturer’s representation “that consumers will\nget less tar by smoking ten packs of Carlton brand ciga\nrettes than by smoking a single pack of the other brands”\nwas deceptive even though it was based on the results of\nCambridge Filter Method testing. In re American Tobacco\nCo., 119 F. T. C. 3, 4. The FTC’s conclusion was based on\nits recognition that, “[i]n truth and in fact, consumers will\nnot necessarily get less tar” due to “such behavior as\ncompensatory smoking.” Ibid.13\n——————\n  13 In a different action, the FTC charged a cigarette manufacturer\n\nwith violating the FTC Act by misleadingly advertising certain brands\nas “low in tar” even though they had a higher-than-average tar rating.\nSee In re American Brands, Inc., 79 F. T. C. 255 (1971). The Commis\nsion and the manufacturer entered a consent order that prevented the\nmanufacturer from making any such representations unless they were\naccompanied by a clear and conspicuous disclosure of the cigarettes’ tar\nand nicotine content as measured by the Cambridge Filter Method. Id.,\nat 258. Petitioners offer this consent order as evidence that the FTC\nauthorized the use of “light” and “low tar” descriptors as long as they\naccurately describe Cambridge Filter Method test results. As the\nGovernment observes, however, the decree only enjoined conduct. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 26. And a consent order is in any\nevent only binding on the parties to the agreement. For all of these\nreasons, the consent order does not support the conclusion that respon\ndents’ claim is impliedly pre-empted.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                    19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   This history shows that, contrary to petitioners’ sugges\ntion, the FTC has no longstanding policy authorizing\ncollateral representations based on Cambridge Filter\nMethod test results. Rather, the FTC has endeavored to\ninform consumers of the comparative tar and nicotine\ncontent of different cigarette brands and has in some\ninstances prevented misleading representations of Cam\nbridge Filter Method test results. The FTC’s failure to\nrequire petitioners to correct their allegedly misleading\nuse of “light” descriptors is not evidence to the contrary;\nagency nonenforcement of a federal statute is not the same\nas a policy of approval. Cf. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,\n537 U. S. 51 (2002) (holding that the Coast Guard’s deci\nsion not to regulate propeller guards did not impliedly pre\nempt petitioner’s tort claims).14\n   More telling are the FTC’s recent statements regarding\nthe use of “light” and “low tar” descriptors. In 1997, the\nCommission observed that “[t]here are no official defini\ntions for” the terms “light” and “low tar,” and it sought\ncomments on whether “there [is] a need for official guid\nance with respect to the terms” and whether “the descrip\ntors convey implied health claims.” 62 Fed. Reg. 48163.\nIn November 2008, following public notice and comment,\nthe Commission rescinded its 1966 guidance concerning\nthe Cambridge Filter Method. 73 Fed. Reg. 74500. The\nrescission is a response to “a consensus among the public\nhealth and scientific communities that the Cambridge\nFilter method is sufficiently flawed that statements of tar\nand nicotine yields as measured by that method are not\nlikely to help consumers make informed decisions.” Id., at\n74503. The Commission’s notice of its proposal to rescind\n——————\n  14 It seems particularly inappropriate to read a policy of authorization\n\ninto the FTC’s inaction when that inaction is in part the result of\npetitioners’ failure to disclose study results showing that Cambridge\nFilter Method test results do not reflect the amount of tar and nicotine\nthat consumers of “light” cigarettes actually inhale. See id., at 8–11.\n20              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe guidance also reiterated the original limits of that\nguidance, noting that it “only addresse[d] simple factual\nstatements of tar and nicotine yields. It d[id] not apply to\nother conduct or express or implied representations, even\nif they concern[ed] tar and nicotine yields.” Id., at 40351.\n   In short, neither the handful of industry guidances and\nconsent orders on which petitioners rely nor the FTC’s\ninaction with regard to “light” descriptors even arguably\njustifies the pre-emption of state deceptive practices rules\nlike the MUTPA.\n                             V\n  We conclude, as we did in Cipollone, that the Labeling\nAct does not pre-empt state-law claims like respondents’\nthat are predicated on the duty not to deceive. We also\nhold that the FTC’s various decisions with respect to\nstatements of tar and nicotine content do not impliedly\npre-empt respondents’ claim. Respondents still must\nprove that petitioners’ use of “light” and “lowered tar”\ndescriptors in fact violated the state deceptive practices\nstatute, but neither the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provi\nsion nor the FTC’s actions in this field prevent a jury from\nconsidering that claim. Accordingly, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992). As\nin that case, the question before us is whether state-law\nclaims alleging that cigarette manufacturers misled the\npublic about the health effects of cigarettes are pre­\nempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising\nAct, as amended in 1969 (Labeling Act or Act). The Label­\ning Act requires that specific health warnings be placed on\nall cigarette packaging and advertising, 15 U. S. C. §1333,\nin order to eliminate “diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\ncigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect\nto any relationship between smoking and health,” §1331.\nTo that end, §5(b) of the Labeling Act pre-empts any “re­\nquirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . .\nimposed under State law with respect to the advertising or\npromotion of any cigarettes.” §1334(b).\n  Whether §5(b) pre-empts state common-law claims\ndivided the Court in Cipollone. The plurality opinion\nfound some claims expressly pre-empted and others not,\ndepending on whether “the legal duty that is the predicate\nof the common-law damages action constitutes a require­\nment or prohibition based on smoking and health . . .\nimposed under State law with respect to . . . advertising or\n2               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npromotion.” 505 U. S., at 524 (internal quotation marks\nomitted; emphasis added). A majority of the Court dis­\nagreed with the plurality’s predicate-duty approach. Id.,\nat 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part, concurring in\njudgment in part, and dissenting in part); id., at 552–554\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting\nin part). In particular, JUSTICE SCALIA recognized that\nthe plurality’s interpretation of §5(b) created an unwork­\nable test for pre-emption with little or no relationship to\nthe text of the statute. Id., at 544, 555–556. The interven­\ning years have vindicated JUSTICE SCALIA’s critical as­\nsessment; the lower courts have consistently expressed\nfrustration at the difficulty in applying the Cipollone\nplurality’s test. Moreover, this Court’s recent pre-emption\ndecisions have undermined, and in some cases overruled,\ncentral aspects of the plurality’s atextual approach to\nexpress pre-emption generally, Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.,\n552 U. S. ___ (2008), and to §5(b) of the Labeling Act\nspecifically, Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525\n(2001).\n   The majority today ignores these problems and adopts\nthe methodology of the Cipollone plurality as governing\nlaw. As a consequence, the majority concludes that state­\nlaw liability for deceiving purchasers about the health\neffects of smoking light cigarettes is not a “requirement or\nprohibition based on smoking and health” under the La­\nbeling Act. The Court’s fidelity to Cipollone is unwise and\nunnecessary. The Court should instead provide the lower\ncourts with a clear test that advances Congress’ stated\ngoals by interpreting §5(b) to expressly pre-empt any\nclaim that “imposes an obligation . . . because of the effect\nof smoking upon health.” Cipollone, supra, at 554 (opinion\nof SCALIA, J.).\n   Respondents’ lawsuit under the Maine Unfair Trade\nPractices Act (MUTPA), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207\n(Supp. 2008), is expressly pre-empted under §5(b) of the\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nLabeling Act. The civil action is premised on the allega­\ntion that the cigarette manufacturers misled respondents\ninto believing that smoking light cigarettes would be\nhealthier for them than smoking regular cigarettes. A\njudgment in respondents’ favor will thus result in a “re­\nquirement” that petitioners represent the effects of smok­\ning on health in a particular way in their advertising and\npromotion of light cigarettes. Because liability in this case\nis thereby premised on the effect of smoking on health, I\nwould hold that respondents’ state-law claims are ex­\npressly pre-empted by §5(b) of the Labeling Act. I respect­\nfully dissent.\n                                I\n   In Cipollone, a smoker and her spouse brought state\ncommon-law claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and\nfailure to warn against cigarette manufacturers for their\nalleged failure to adequately disclose the health risks of\nsmoking. 505 U. S., at 509. As here, the cigarette manu­\nfacturer asserted that the claims were pre-empted by §5(b)\nof the Labeling Act.\n   In deciding the case, the Court could not agree on the\nmeaning of the Labeling Act’s express pre-emption provi­\nsion. It produced three separate opinions, none of which\nreflected the views of a majority of Justices. Relying\nheavily on a “presumption against the pre-emption of state\npolice power regulations,” a plurality opinion by JUSTICE\nSTEVENS settled on a “narrow reading” of the Labeling Act\nthat tested §5(b)’s pre-emptive effect under a claim-by­\nclaim approach. Id., at 524. This approach considered\neach state-law claim and asked whether it is predicated\n“on a duty ‘based on smoking and health.’ ” Id., at 528; see\nalso id., at 524. If so, the claim is pre-empted. Id., at 524,\n528. If, however, the claim is predicated on a “more gen­\neral obligation” under state law, it may proceed. Id., at\n528–529.\n4               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Applying a test that it conceded lacked “theoretical\nelegance,” id., at 530, n. 27, the plurality held that the\nfailure-to-warn claims were pre-empted “to the extent that\nthose claims rel[ied] on omissions or inclusions in . . .\nadvertising or promotions” of cigarettes. Id., at 531. The\nsame was true for one of the fraud claims, which alleged\nthat the cigarette manufacturers had used their advertis­\ning to neutralize the federally required warning labels.\nId., at 527–528. The plurality determined that these\nclaims were “predicated on a state-law prohibition against\nstatements . . . that tend to minimize the health hazards\nassociated with smoking.” Id., at 527. Thus, according to\nthe plurality, these state-law claims sought recovery\nunder the theory that the cigarette manufacturer\nbreached a duty based on smoking or health. But the\nplurality found that the other fraud claim, which alleged\nmisrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, was\nnot pre-empted because it was based on a more general\nstate-law obligation: “the duty not to deceive.” Id., at 528–\n529.\n  Justice Blackmun, writing for three Justices, departed\nfrom the plurality on the antecedent question whether the\nLabeling Act pre-empted state common-law damages\nclaims at all. Id., at 535–542 (opinion, joined by KENNEDY\nand SOUTER, JJ., concurring in part, concurring in judg­\nment in part, and dissenting in part). He concluded that\nthe phrase “ ‘State law’ ” in §5(b) referred only to “positive\nenactments such as statutes and regulations.” Id., at 535.\nBut Justice Blackmun specifically noted that even if state\ncommon-law claims were within the scope of the Labeling\nAct, he could not join the plurality’s claim-by-claim ap­\nproach because he “perceive[d] no principled basis for\nmany of the plurality’s asserted distinctions among the\ncommon-law claims.” Id., at 543. Justice Blackmun wrote\nthat Congress could not have “intended to create such a\nhodgepodge of allowed and disallowed claims when it\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Id., at 543–\n544.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, writing for two Justices, also faulted\nthe plurality for its claim-by-claim approach. Id., at 544–\n556 (opinion, joined by THOMAS, J., concurring in judg­\nment in part and dissenting in part). Although he agreed\nwith the plurality that the phrase “ ‘State law’ ” in §5(b)\nencompassed state common-law claims as well as state\nstatutes and regulations, id., at 548–549, JUSTICE SCALIA\nobjected to the plurality’s invocation of a presumption\nagainst pre-emption to narrowly interpret §5(b), id., at\n544, 545–547. Because Congress had expressed its intent\nto pre-empt state law by enacting §5(b), the Court’s “re­\nsponsibility [was] to apply to the text ordinary principles\nof statutory construction.” Id., at 545.1 By employing its\n“newly crafted doctrine of narrow construction,” JUSTICE\nSCALIA wrote, the plurality arrived at a cramped and\nunnatural construction of §5(b) that failed to give effect to\nthe statutory text. Id., at 544–548.\n  Applying “ordinary principles” of statutory construction,\nid., at 548, JUSTICE SCALIA determined that the proper\ntest for pre-emption of state-law claims under §5(b) was\nfar less complicated than the plurality’s claim-by-claim\napproach. As he explained, “[o]nce one is forced to select a\nconsistent methodology for evaluating whether a given\nlegal duty is ‘based on smoking and health,’ it becomes\nobvious that the methodology must focus not upon the\n——————\n  1 JUSTICE SCALIA also criticized the plurality for announcing a new\n\nrule that the enactment of an express pre-emption clause eliminates\nany consideration of implied pre-emption. He explained that this new\nrule created mischief because, when combined with the presumption\nagainst pre-emption, it placed a heavy burden of exactitude on Con­\ngress when it wishes to say anything about pre-emption. See Cipollone,\n505 U. S., at 547–548.\n6               ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v.

This “proximate application”\ntest, therefore, focuses not on the state-law duty invoked\nby the plaintiff, but on the effect of the suit on the ciga­\nrette manufacturer’s conduct—i.e., the “requirement” or\n“prohibition” that would be imposed under state law. Put\nsimply, if, “whatever the source of the duty, [the claim]\nimposes an obligation . . . because of the effect of smoking\nupon health,” it is pre-empted. Id., at 554; see also id., at\n555 (“The test for pre-emption in this setting should be\none of practical compulsion, i.e., whether the law practi­\ncally compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior\nthat Congress has barred the States from prescribing\ndirectly”). JUSTICE SCALIA also seconded Justice Black­\nmun’s concern that the lower courts would find the plural­\nity’s distinctions between materially identical state-law\nclaims to be incapable of application: “A disposition that\nraises more questions than it answers does not serve the\ncountry well.” Id., at 556.\n                               II\n   Sixteen years later, we must confront Cipollone to re­\nsolve the question presented in this case: whether respon­\ndents’ class-action claims for fraudulent marketing under\nthe MUTPA are pre-empted by §5(b) of the Labeling Act.\nThe majority adheres to Cipollone because it “remain[s]\npersuaded” that the plurality’s construction of the §5(b)\nwas “ ‘fair.’ ” Ante, at 13–14. I disagree. The Court should\ndiscard the Cipollone plurality’s ill-conceived predicate­\nduty approach and replace it with JUSTICE SCALIA’s far\nmore workable and textually sound “proximate applica­\ntion” test.\n   The majority does not assert that the Cipollone plurality\nopinion is binding precedent, and rightly so. Because the\n“plurality opinion . . . did not represent the views of a\nmajority of the Court, we are not bound by its reasoning.”\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

But even if the\nplurality opinion had some force beyond its mere persua­\nsive value, it nevertheless should be abandoned.

We\nowe far more to the lower courts, which depend on this\nCourt’s guidance, and to litigants, who must conform their\nactions to the Court’s interpretation of federal law. The\nCipollone plurality’s test for pre-emption under §5(b)\nshould be abandoned for this reason alone.\n                             B\n   Furthermore, in the years since Cipollone was decided,\nthis Court has altered its doctrinal approach to express\npre-emption. The Cipollone plurality justified what it\ndescribed as the “theoretical [in]elegance” of its construc­\ntion of §5(b) by relying on the presumption against pre­\nemption, which, it argued, required a narrow, but “fair,”\nconstruction of the statute. 505 U. S., at 530, n. 27. See,\ne.g., id., at 518 (majority opinion) (“This presumption\nreinforces the appropriateness of a narrow reading of §5”);\nid., at 523 (plurality opinion) (“[W]e must . . . narrowly\nconstrue the precise language of §5(b)”); id., at 524 (§5(b)\nmust be given “a fair but narrow reading”); id., at 529\n(“[W]e conclude that the phrase ‘based on smoking and\nhealth’ fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass\nthe more general duty not to make fraudulent state­\nments”). Of course, as JUSTICE SCALIA explained, there\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            9\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwas nothing “fair” about imposing an artificially narrow\nconstruction on the Labeling Act’s pre-emption provision.\nSee id., at 545 (explaining that the presumption against\npre-emption “dissolves once there is conclusive evidence of\nintent to pre-empt in the express words of the statute\nitself ”).\n   Since Cipollone, the Court’s reliance on the presumption\nagainst pre-emption has waned in the express pre-emption\ncontext. In 2002, for example, the Court unanimously\nexplained that the “task of statutory construction must in\nthe first instance focus on the plain wording of the [ex­\npress pre-emption] clause, which necessarily contains the\nbest evidence of Congress’ pre-emptive intent.” Sprietsma\nv. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 62–63 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Without referring to any presumption\nagainst pre-emption, the Court decided that the Federal\nBoat Safety Act of 1971’s express pre-emption provision\ndid not pre-empt state-law claims. Id., at 62–64. Most\nother decisions since Cipollone also have refrained from\ninvoking the presumption in the context of express pre­\nemption. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp.\nAssn., 552 U. S. ___ (2008); Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South\nCoast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U. S. 246 (2004);\nBuckman Co. v. Plaintiffs’ Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341\n(2001); United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89 (2000); Geier v.\nAmerican Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000).\n   The Court has invoked the presumption sporadically\nduring this time frame. As the majority notes, ante, at 5,\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470 (1996), applied the\npresumption against pre-emption in deciding that the\nfederal manufacturing and labeling requirements of the\nMedical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) did not pre­\nempt state common-law claims. Id., at 500–501. Like\nCipollone before it, Lohr produced a fractured decision\nfeaturing three opinions. 518 U. S., at 474 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.), id., at 503 (BREYER, J., concurring in part\n10                  ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nand concurring in judgment), id., at 509 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). And, like\nCipollone, Lohr’s approach to express pre-emption pre­\ndates the Court’s recent jurisprudence on the topic. In\nfact, this Court last year revisited the pre-emption provi­\nsion of the MDA, 21 U. S. C. §360k(a)(1), and did not\nemploy any presumption against pre-emption. Riegel v.\nMedtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___ (2008). See infra, at 11-13.2\n   More recently, in Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, a case revisiting\nthe meaning of §5(b) of the Labeling Act, the Court briefly\nalluded to the presumption, but did not rely on it to reach\nits decision. See id., at 541–542, 546–551. Indeed, the\nCourt’s cursory treatment of the presumption in Reilly\nstands in stark contrast to the First Circuit decision it\nreversed; the First Circuit relied heavily on the “full force”\nof the presumption to determine that the regulations at\nissue were not pre-empted. See Consolidated Cigar Corp.\nv. Reilly, 218 F. 3d 30, 38–41 (2000). This Court, in over­\nturning that judgment, declined to employ the presump­\ntion in its construction of §5(b). See Reilly, 533 U. S., at\n546–551. JUSTICE STEVENS highlighted this very point in\ndissent, arguing that if the presumption had been faith­\n\n\n——————\n  2 Also, as in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992), the\nfractured decision in Lohr was a source of confusion for the lower\ncourts. See Kemp v. Medtronic, Inc., 231 F. 3d 216, 224 (CA6 2000)\n(“The various courts of appeals that have confronted issues of preemp­\ntion arising under the MDA have struggled mightily with Lohr’s\nlanguage in an effort to discern its holding”); see also Martin v. Med\ntronic, Inc., 254 F. 3d 573, 579 (CA5 2001) (“Because only parts of\nJustice Stevens’s opinion commanded a majority, extracting the final\nmeaning of Lohr is no easy task. . . . Although Justice Breyer’s concur­\nrence very specifically disavows the view that common law duties\ncannot provide substantive requirements for the purpose of preemption,\nneither his concurrence nor the plurality opinion offers much help to us\nin developing the point”). The confusion was cleared up in Riegel. See\ninfra, at 11–13.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           11\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfully applied, the result would have been different. Id., at\n591–593.\n  The majority also relies on Bates v. Dow Agrosciences\nLLC, 544 U. S. 431 (2005), where the presumption was\nagain mentioned, but only in dicta. As in Reilly, the pre­\nsumption did not drive the Court’s construction of the\nstatute at issue. 544 U. S., at 449 (explaining that the\npresumption meant just that the holding of no pre­\nemption would have been the same “even if [respondent’s]\nalternative [construction of the statute] were just as plau­\nsible as our reading of the text”); see also id., at 457\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissent­\ning in part) (agreeing that the case should be vacated and\nremanded and reiterating that the “presumption does not\napply . . . when Congress has included within a statute an\nexpress pre-emption provision”). At bottom, although the\nCourt’s treatment of the presumption against pre-emption\nhas not been uniform, the Court’s express pre-emption\ncases since Cipollone have marked a retreat from reliance\non it to distort the statutory text.\n  If any doubt remained, it was eliminated last Term in\nRiegel. The question in Riegel, as noted above, was\nwhether the MDA expressly pre-empts state common-law\nclaims “challenging the safety and effectiveness of a medi­\ncal device given premarket approval by the Food and Drug\nAdministration.” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1). Over\nthe dissent of one Justice, the Court held that the state­\nlaw claims were pre-empted because the requirements the\nplaintiffs sought to impose were “ ‘different from, or in\naddition to, any requirement applicable . . . to the device’ ”\nunder federal law. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (quoting 21\nU. S. C. §360k(a)(1)). The Court interpreted the statute\nwithout reference to the presumption or any perceived\nneed to impose a narrow construction on the provision in\norder to protect the police power of the States. Rather, the\n12                ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCourt simply construed the MDA in accordance with\nordinary principles of statutory construction.\n   This was not accidental. The dissent focused on the\nCourt’s refusal to invoke the presumption in order to save\nthe state-law claims from pre-emption. 552 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at ___) (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). The dissent\nwas adamant that “[f]ederal laws containing a preemption\nclause do not automatically escape the presumption\nagainst pre-emption.” Ibid. (slip op., at 2–3); id., at ___\n(slip op., at 3) (“Where the text of a pre-emption clause is\nopen to more than one plausible reading, courts ordinarily\n‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-emption’ ” (quoting\nBates, supra, at 449)). In accordance with the presump­\ntion, the dissent would have found the state-law claims\nunder review to fall beyond the reach of the MDA’s ex­\npress pre-emption provision. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n___); see also id., at ___, n. 8 (slip op., at 6, n. 8); id., at ___,\nn. 9 (slip op., at 7, n. 9) (rejecting the majority’s construc­\ntion of §360(d) because “the presumption against pre­\nemption [is] operative even in construing a preemption\nclause”). Given the dissent’s clear call for the use of the\npresumption against pre-emption, the Court’s decision not\nto invoke it was necessarily a rejection of any role for the\npresumption in construing the statute.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS also declined to invoke the presump­\ntion in his opinion. Id., at ___ (opinion concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment). In his view, the “signifi­\ncance of the pre-emption provision in the [MDA] was not\nfully appreciated until many years after it was enacted”\nand, therefore, it is “a statute whose text and general\nobjective cover territory not actually envisioned by its\nauthors.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1). But JUSTICE STEVENS’\nopinion in Riegel—unlike the majority opinion here, the\nplurality opinion in Cipollone, and the dissenting opinion\nin Riegel—did not invoke the presumption to bend the text\nof the statute to meet the perceived purpose of Congress.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)            13\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nInstead, JUSTICE STEVENS correctly found that “ ‘it is\nultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the\nprincipal concerns of our legislators by which we are gov­\nerned.’ ” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (quoting Oncale v.\nSundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 79–80\n(1998)).\n   In light of Riegel, there is no authority for invoking the\npresumption against pre-emption in express pre-emption\ncases. The majority here thus turns to Lohr to revive the\npresumption and, in turn, to justify its restrictive reading\nof the Labeling Act’s express pre-emption provision. But,\nas Riegel plainly shows, the Court is no longer willing to\nunreasonably interpret expressly pre-emptive federal laws\nin the name of “ ‘congressional purpose,’ ” ante, at 14, or\nbecause “Congress has legislated in a field traditionally\noccupied by the States,” ante, at 5. The text of the statute\nmust control.\n   Riegel also undermined Cipollone in an even more fun­\ndamental way: It conclusively decided that a common-law\ncause of action imposes a state-law “ ‘requiremen[t]’ ” that\nmay be pre-empted by federal law. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 11) (“Absent other indication, reference to a State’s\n‘requirements’ includes its common-law duties . . . . In­\ndeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries\nunder a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less\ndeserving of preservation [than regulatory legislation]”).\nJustice Blackmun’s contrary interpretation of §5(b) of the\nLabeling Act in Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 538–539 (opinion\nconcurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and\ndissenting in part), which provided the votes necessary for\nthe judgment, thus is no longer tenable. In light of\nRiegel’s rejection of the presumption against pre-emption\nrelied on by the plurality, as well as the definition of “re­\nquirements” relied on in Justice Blackmun’s concurring\nopinion, Cipollone’s approach to express pre-emption is\nnothing more than “a remnant of abandoned doctrine.”\n14              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505\nU. S. 833, 855 (1992).\n                              C\n   The Cipollone plurality’s reading of §5(b) of the Labeling\nAct was further undermined by this Court’s decision in\nReilly, 533 U. S. 525. There, the Court confronted regula­\ntions imposed by the Massachusetts attorney general on\nthe location of tobacco advertising pursuant to the Com­\nmonwealth’s unfair trade practices statute. Id., at 533–\n536. The Court found the regulations—to the extent they\napplied to cigarettes—expressly pre-empted because,\nalthough Massachusetts remained free to enact “generally\napplicable zoning restrictions,” its imposition of “special\nrequirements or prohibitions ‘based on smoking and\nhealth’ ‘with respect to the advertising or promotion of\ncigarettes’ ” fell within the ambit of §5(b)’s pre-emptive\nsweep. Id., at 551.\n   Reilly did not ignore Cipollone. It cited the plurality\nopinion extensively in its discussion of the basic history\nand text of the Labeling Act. 533 U. S., at 540–546. But\nin analyzing whether the regulations enacted by the Mas­\nsachusetts attorney general were expressly pre-empted,\nthe Court was silent about Cipollone. 533 U. S., at 546–\n551. Unlike the District Court, which saw “the central\nquestion for purposes of pre-emption [as] whether the\nregulations create[d] a predicate legal duty based on\nsmoking and health,” id., at 537, the Court’s substantive\nexamination of the regulations under §5(b) included no\nmention of the Cipollone plurality’s “predicate duty” test.\nSee 533 U. S., at 546–551. Instead, the Court disagreed\nwith “the Attorney General’s narrow construction” of the\nstatute’s “ ‘based on smoking and health’ ” language, and\nconcluded that the regulations were pre-empted because\nthey were “motivated by” and “intertwined with” the\nconcerns about smoking and health. Id., at 547–548.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           15\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Reilly, therefore, cannot be reconciled with the Cipollone\nplurality’s interpretation of §5(b) of the Labeling Act. The\nregulations at issue in Reilly were enacted to implement a\nMassachusetts state law imposing a duty against unfair\nand deceptive trade practices—the same predicate duty\nasserted under the MUTPA in this case. 533 U. S., at 533.\nThe state-law duty at issue in Reilly was no less general\nthan the state-law duty at issue in this case or the state­\nlaw fraud claims confronted in Cipollone. Compare Mass.\nGen. Laws, ch. 93A, §2(a) (West 1996) (“Unfair methods of\ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the\nconduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared\nunlawful”), with Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207 (Supp.\n2008) (“Unfair methods of competition and unfair or de­\nceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or\ncommerce are declared unlawful”), and Cipollone, supra,\nat 528 (explaining that the “predicate” of the plaintiff’s\nfraudulent misrepresentation claim was “a state-law duty\nnot to make false statements of material fact or to conceal\nsuch facts”). Faithful application of the Cipollone plurality\nopinion, therefore, would have required the Court in Reilly\nto uphold the regulations. Indeed, JUSTICE STEVENS\nargued as much in his dissent. 533 U. S., at 597 (noting\nthat “[n]ary a word in any of the three Cipollone opinions\nsupports the thesis that §5 should be interpreted to pre­\nempt state regulation of the location of signs advertising\ncigarettes”).\n   And yet, the majority today finds that Reilly and Cipol\nlone are perfectly compatible. It contends that, although\nthe regulations in question in Reilly “derived from a gen­\neral deceptive practices statute like the one at issue in this\ncase,” they were pre-empted because they “targeted adver­\ntising that tended to promote tobacco use by children\ninstead of prohibiting false or misleading statements.”\nAnte, at 12. According to the majority, that legal duty\ncontrasts with the regulations here, as “[t]he MUTPA says\n16              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nnothing about either ‘smoking’ or ‘health.’ ” Ante, at 13;\nsee also ante, at 10. But the Cipollone plurality expressly\nrejected any distinction between targeted regulations like\nthose in Reilly and general duties imposed by the common\nlaw. 505 U. S., at 522. In fact, the general duties underly­\ning the failure-to-warn and warning-neutralization claims\nin Cipollone—which the plurality found to be pre­\nempted—say nothing about smoking and health. Id., at\n524; see also id., at 553 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg­\nment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the duty\nto warn about a product’s dangers was not “specifically\ncrafted with an eye toward ‘smoking and health’ ”).\n  Accordingly, Reilly is better understood as establishing\nthat even a general duty can impose requirements or\nprohibitions based on smoking and health. Reilly weak­\nened the force of the Cipollone plurality’s “predicate duty”\napproach to the pre-emptive effect of §5(b) and cast doubt\non its continuing utility.\n                              D\n  Finally, the Cipollone plurality’s approach should be\ndiscarded because its “predicate duty” approach is unper­\nsuasive as an initial matter. In considering the warning­\nneutralization claim, for example, the Cipollone plurality\nasserted that the claim is predicated on a state-law prohi­\nbition against minimizing the health risks associated with\nsmoking. 505 U. S., at 527. The Court today reaffirms\nthis view. Ante, at 10; see also ante, at 13 (describing §5(b)\nas expressly pre-empting “rules . . . that are based on\nsmoking and health”). But every products liability action,\nincluding a failure-to-warn action, applies generally to all\nproducts. See Cipollone, supra, at 553 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.). Thus, the “duty” or “rule” involved in a failure-to-warn\nclaim is no more specific to smoking and health than is a\ncommon-law fraud claim based on the “duty” or “rule” not\nto use deceptive or misleading trade practices.

This shifting\nlevel of generality was identified as a logical weakness in\nthe original Cipollone plurality decision by a majority of\nthe Court, 505 U. S., at 543 (Blackmun, J., concurring in\npart, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in\npart); id., at 553–554 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), and it re­\nmains equally unconvincing today.\n   It is therefore unsurprising that the Court’s defense of\nthe plurality’s confusing test is confined to one sentence\nand a footnote. See ante, at 13–14 (“While we again ac­\nknowledge that our analysis of these claims may lack\n‘theoretical elegance,’ we remain persuaded that it repre­\nsents ‘a fair understanding of congressional purpose’ ”\n(quoting Cipollone, supra, at 529–530, n. 27)); ante, at 10,\nn. 7. The majority instead argues that this approach “fails\nto explain why Congress would . . . permi[t] cigarette\nmanufacturers to engage in fraudulent advertising.” Ante,\nat 10, n. 7. But no explanation is necessary; the text\nspeaks for itself. Congress has pre-empted only those\nclaims that would impose “requirement[s] or prohibition[s]\nbased on smoking and health.” 15 U. S. C. §1334(b).\nThus, if cigarette manufacturers were to falsely advertise\ntheir products as “American-made,” or “the official ciga­\nrette of Major League Baseball,” state-law claims arising\nfrom that wrongful behavior would not be pre-empted.\n   Furthermore, contrary to the majority’s policy argu­\nments, faithful application of the statutory language does\nnot authorize fraudulent advertising with respect to smok­\ning and health.3 Any misleading promotional statements\n——————\n  3 The majority’s policy-based attack could just as easily be leveled\n\nagainst its own determination that the Labeling Act pre-empts failure­\nto-warn claims. But just as there is no basis in fact or law to contend\nthat the Labeling Act encourages the marketing of hazardous products\nwithout adequate warning labels, ante, at 10, n. 8, there is no basis\nto contend that the text of the Labeling Act permits fraudulent\n18                 ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor cigarettes remain subject to federal regulatory over­\nsight under the Labeling Act. See §1336. The relevant\nquestion thus is not whether “petitioners will be prohib­\nited from selling as ‘light’ or ‘low tar’ only those cigarettes\nthat are not actually light and do not actually deliver less\ntar and nicotine.” Ante, at 12, n. 10. Rather, the issue is\nwhether the Labeling Act allows regulators and juries to\ndecide, on a state-by-state basis, whether petitioners’ light\nand low-tar descriptors were in fact fraudulent, or instead\nwhether §5(b) charged the Federal Government with\nreaching a comprehensive judgment with respect to this\nquestion.\n   Congress chose a uniform federal standard. Under the\nLabeling Act, Congress “establish[ed] a comprehensive\nFederal Program to deal with cigarette labeling and ad­\nvertising,” 15 U. S. C. §1331, so that “commerce and the\nnational economy may . . . not [be] impeded by diverse,\nnonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertis­\ning regulations with respect to any relationship between\nsmoking and health,” §1331(2)(B).4 The majority’s dis­\ntorted interpretation of §5(b) defeats this express congres­\nsional purpose, opening the door to an untold number of\ndeceptive-practices lawsuits across the country.           The\nquestion whether marketing a light cigarette is “ ‘misrep­\nresentative’ ” in light of compensatory behavior “would\nalmost certainly be answered differently from State to\nState.” Cipollone, supra, 505 U. S., at 553 (opinion of\n\n——————\nadvertising.\n  4 The majority contends that the relatively constrained enforcement\n\npower of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1970 undermines any\nargument that Congress intended the Labeling Act to prevent States\nfrom regulating deceptive advertising and marketing of cigarettes.\nAnte, at 8, n. 6. I am unwilling to rely on the majority’s perception of\nthe relative power of the FTC in 1970 to ignore Congress’ stated pur­\npose in enacting the Labeling Act and the plain meaning of the Act’s\nexpress pre-emption provision.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

This will inevitably result in the nonuniform\nimposition of liability for the marketing of light and/or\nlow-tar cigarettes—the precise problem that Congress\nintended §5(b) to remedy.\n   In light of these serious flaws in the majority’s ap­\nproach, even if the Cipollone plurality opinion were bind­\ning precedent, the Court “should not hesitate to allow our\nprecedent to yield to the true meaning of an Act of Con­\ngress when our statutory precedent is ‘unworkable’ or\n‘badly reasoned.’ ” Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 402\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Holder v. Hall,\n512 U. S. 874, 936 (1994) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment), in turn quoting Payne, 501 U.

United\nStates, 511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994). When a decision of this\nCourt has failed to properly interpret a statute, we should\nnot “place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the\nCourt’s own error.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U.

See Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 14–33. Instead, it addressed only the question of implied pre­\nemption, an issue I do not reach because of my resolution of the ques­\ntion on express pre-emption.\n20              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nof the Labeling Act. Respondents, longtime smokers of\nMarlboro Lights, claim that they have suffered an injury\nas a result of petitioners’ decision to advertise these ciga­\nrettes as “light” and/or “low-tar and low nicotine products.”\n436 F. Supp. 2d, at 144–145. They claim that petitioners\nmarketed their cigarettes as “light” and/or “low-tar and\nlow-nicotine products” despite knowledge that light­\ncigarette smokers would engage in compensatory behavior\ncausing them to inhale at least as much tar and nicotine\nas smokers of regular cigarettes. Ibid. Respondents thus\nallege that they were misled into thinking that they were\ngaining a health advantage by smoking the light ciga­\nrettes, ibid., and, as a result, petitioners’ conduct was an\n“unfair or deceptive act or practice” under the MUTPA.\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §207; 436 F. Supp. 2d, at 133.\n   Respondents’ claims seek to impose liability on petition­\ners because of the effect that smoking light cigarettes had\non their health. The alleged misrepresentation here—that\n“light” and “low-tar” cigarettes are not as healthy as ad­\nvertised—is actionable only because of the effect that\nsmoking light and low-tar cigarettes had on respondents’\nhealth. Otherwise, any alleged misrepresentation about\nthe effect of the cigarettes on health would be immaterial\nfor purposes of the MUTPA and would not be the source of\nthe injuries that provided the impetus for the class-action\nlawsuit. See State v. Weinschenk, 2005 ME 28, ¶17, 868\nA. 2d 200, 206 (“An act or practice is deceptive [under the\nMUTPA] if it is a material representation, omission, act or\npractice that is likely to mislead consumers acting rea­\nsonably under the circumstances” (emphasis added)).\nTherefore, with this suit, respondents seek to require the\ncigarette manufacturers to provide additional warnings\nabout compensatory behavior, or to prohibit them from\nselling these products with the “light” or “low-tar” descrip­\ntors. This is exactly the type of lawsuit that is pre-empted\nby the Labeling Act. Cf. Rowe, 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

See ante, at 11, n. 9. If the claims arise from\nidentical conduct, the claims impose the same requirement\nor prohibition with respect to that conduct. And when\nthat allegedly wrongful conduct involves misleading\nstatements about the health effects of smoking a particu­\nlar brand of cigarette, the liability and resulting require­\nment or prohibition are, by definition, based on smoking\nand health.\n   Finally, at oral argument, respondents argued that their\nclaims do not impose requirements based on smoking and\nhealth because the damages they seek to recover are not\n——————\n  6 The majority’s observation that no warning-neutralization claim is\n\nat issue in this case, ante, at 11 n. 9, misses the point. The principal\nweakness in the Cipollone plurality’s logic is not its distinction between\nclaims for warning neutralization and claims for fraud. It is the fact\nthat the predicate duty underlying New Jersey’s products liability law,\nfrom which the majority now claims the warning-neutralization claim\nderived, see ante, at 11, n. 8, was no more specific to smoking and\nhealth than the predicate duty underlying the fraud claim, see Cipol\nlone, 505 U. S., at 552–553 (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“Each duty tran­\nscends the relationship between the cigarette companies and cigarette\nsmokers; neither duty was specifically crafted with an eye toward\n‘smoking and health’ ”); id., at 543 (opinion of Blackmun, J.); see also\nsupra, at 16. Thus, the products-liability and the fraud claims must\nstand or fall together. The majority’s refusal to address the logical\ninconsistency of its approach remains as glaring today as it was in\nCipollone.\n22              ALTRIA GROUP, INC. v. GOOD\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbased on the effect of smoking on their health; rather,\nrespondents are “asking . . . for the difference in value\nbetween a product [they] thought [they] were buying and a\nproduct [they] actually bought.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 29. But\nthe requirement or prohibition covered by §5(b) is created\nby the imposition of liability for particular conduct—here,\nthe way in which petitioners marketed “light” and “low­\ntar,” and “low-nicotine” cigarettes—not by the manner in\nwhich respondents have chosen to measure their damages.\nNo matter how respondents characterize their damages\nclaim, they have not been injured for purposes of the\nMUTPA, and thus cannot recover, unless their decision to\npurchase the cigarettes had a negative effect on their\nhealth.\n  In any event, respondents sought “such injunctive relief\nas may be appropriate” in this case. App. 42a. The\nMUTPA specifically authorizes “other equitable relief,\nincluding an injunction,” to remedy unfair or deceptive\ntrade practices. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §213(1) (West\n2002). And a court-crafted injunction prohibiting petition­\ners from marketing light cigarettes would be no less a\nrequirement or prohibition than the regulations found to\nbe pre-empted in Reilly. In the end, no matter what form\nthe remedy takes, the liability with respect to the specific\nclaim still creates the requirement or prohibition. When\nthat liability is necessarily premised on the effects of\nsmoking on health, as respondents’ claims are here, the\ncivil action is pre-empted by §5(b) of the Labeling Act.\n                            IV\n   The Court today elects to convert the Cipollone plural­\nity opinion into binding law, notwithstanding its weak­\nened doctrinal foundation, its atextual construction of the\nstatute, and the lower courts’ inability to apply its meth­\nodology.
