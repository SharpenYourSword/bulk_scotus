UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 07\u201310689.    Decided October 14, 2008 \n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  James Eric Moore was convicted of one count of possess\ning cocaine base with intent to distribute, a violation of 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841(a)(1) and (b)(1). Given the quantity of crack\ncocaine, the presentence report calculated that Moore\u2019s\nsentencing range under the United States Sentencing\nGuidelines was 151 to 188 months. At sentencing, Moore\nasked the District Court to impose a below-Guidelines\nsentence in light of our decision in United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220 (2005), and the Guidelines\u2019 disparate treat\nment of similar amounts of crack and powder cocaine.\n  The District Court refused, saying:\n    \u201cWith regard to the crack and powder cocaine differ\n    ence, that is the law. I\u2019m applying the law as it cur\n    rently stands. If that is going to be changed, that is a\n    congressional matter. Congress is the one who looks\n    at the guidelines and decides whether or not they\n    should be put in\u2014in force. . . . It isn\u2019t the judges. It\u2019s\n    the lawmakers, and I have taken an oath to apply the\n    law, and that\u2019s what I will do in this sentencing.\u201d\n    App. C to Pet. for Cert. 55\u201356.\nThe District Court sentenced Moore to 188 months of\nimprisonment and six years of supervised release.\n  Moore appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eighth Circuit affirmed his conviction and sen\ntence. United States v. Moore, 470 F. 3d 767 (2006). In\nresponse to his claim that the District Court should have\nconsidered the crack/powder disparity, the Court of Ap\n2                MOORE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\npeals held that \u201cthe district court was correct in conclud\ning that \u2018neither Booker nor [18 U. S. C.] \u00a73553(a) author\nizes district courts to reject\u2019 the powder cocaine to crack\ncocaine quantity ratio mandated by Congress and reflected\nin the Guidelines.\u201d Id., at 770 (quoting United States v.\nSpears, 469 F. 3d 1166, 1176 (CA8 2006) (en banc)).\nMoore filed a petition for certiorari with this Court. Pet.\nfor Cert. in Moore v. United States, No. 06\u20139749.\n   While Moore\u2019s certiorari petition was pending, this\nCourt issued its opinion in Kimbrough v. United States,\n552 U. S. ___ (2007), concluding that a judge \u201cmay con\nsider the disparity between the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of\ncrack and powder cocaine offenses\u201d when applying 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(a), \u201ceven in a mine-run case.\u201d Id., at ___,\n___ (slip op., at 2, 21). We granted Moore\u2019s petition, va\ncated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Eighth\nCircuit for further consideration in light of Kimbrough.\nMoore v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n   On remand, without new briefing, the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed again. 518 F. 3d 577 (2008). This time, the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that \u201c[a]s there was then no\ncircuit authority to the contrary, we presume the district\ncourt was aware that Booker granted it discretion to vary\ndownward based upon the impact of the crack cocaine\nguidelines on this defendant, but elected not to exercise\nthat discretion.\u201d Id., at 580.\n   Proceeding pro se, Moore again petitioned for certiorari,\narguing that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s new characterization of\nthe transcript is wrong, and that it is \u201cclear that the dis\ntrict court thought judges had no discre[t]ion to reject\u201d the\nGuidelines ratio. Pet. for Cert. 7. The United States\nagrees that the Eighth Circuit erred, see Brief for United\nStates 9, and so do we.\n   When the District Court said that \u201c[i]t isn\u2019t the judges\u201d\nbut Congress that \u201clooks at the [G]uidelines and decides\nwhether or not they should be put . . . in force,\u201d the court\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The\nEighth Circuit\u2019s first decision recognized this, describing\nthe District Court as \u201cconcluding\u201d (correctly under circuit\nprecedent) that it was not \u201cauthorize[d] . . . to reject\u201d the\ncrack/powder disparity. Moore, 470 F. 3d, at 770 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). In light of the District Court\u2019s\ncomments at sentencing, the Court of Appeals should have\nremanded the case to the District Court for resentencing\nunder Kimbrough. We express no views on how the Dis\ntrict Court should exercise its discretion at resentencing.\n   The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n",
