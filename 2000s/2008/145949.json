LOUISIANA\n               ON PETITION FOR REHEARING\n\n                       [October 1, 2008]\n\n  Statement of JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE joins, respecting the denial of rehearing.\n   Respondent has moved for rehearing of this case be-\ncause there has come to light a federal statute enacted in\n2006 permitting the death sentence under the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice for rape of a minor. See Pub L.\n109\u2013163, \u00a7552(b)(1), 119 Stat. 3263. This provision was\nnot cited by either party, nor by any of the numerous\namici in the case; it was first brought to the Court\u2019s atten-\ntion after the opinion had issued, in a letter signed by 85\nMembers of Congress. Respondent asserts that rehearing\nis justified because this statute calls into question the\nmajority opinion\u2019s conclusion that there is a national\nconsensus against capital punishment for rape of a child.\n   I am voting against the petition for rehearing because\nthe views of the American people on the death penalty for\nchild rape were, to tell the truth, irrelevant to the major-\nity\u2019s decision in this case. The majority opinion, after an\nunpersuasive attempt to show that a consensus against\nthe penalty existed, in the end came down to this: \u201c[T]he\nConstitution contemplates that in the end our own judg-\nment will be brought to bear on the question of the accept-\nability of the death penalty under the Eighth Amend-\nment.\u201d Ante, at ___ (slip op., at 24). Of course the\nConstitution contemplates no such thing; the proposed\n2                 KENNEDY v. LOUISIANA\n\n                    Statement of SCALIA, J.\n\nEighth Amendment would have been laughed to scorn if it\nhad read \u201cno criminal penalty shall be imposed which the\nSupreme Court deems unacceptable.\u201d But that is what\nthe majority opinion said, and there is no reason to believe\nthat absence of a national consensus would provoke second\nthoughts.\n   While the new evidence of American opinion is ulti-\nmately irrelevant to the majority\u2019s decision, let there be no\ndoubt that it utterly destroys the majority\u2019s claim to be\ndiscerning a national consensus and not just giving effect\nto the majority\u2019s own preference. As noted in the letter\nfrom Members of Congress, the bill providing the death\npenalty for child rape passed the Senate 95\u20130; it passed\nthe House 374\u201341, with the votes of a majority of each\nState\u2019s delegation; and was signed by the President.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY\u2019s statement posits two reasons why this\nact by Congress proves nothing about the national consen-\nsus regarding permissible penalties for child rape. First,\nit claims the statute merely \u201creclassif[ied]\u201d the offense of\nchild rape. Ante, at 2. But the law did more than that; it\nspecifically established (as it would have to do) the penalty\nfor the new offense of child rape\u2014and that penalty was\ndeath: \u201cFor an offense under subsection (a) (rape) or sub-\nsection (b) (rape of a child), death or such other punish-\nment as a court-martial may direct.\u201d \u00a7552(b)(1), 119 Stat.\n3263 (emphasis added). By separate executive order, the\nPresident later expressly reauthorized the death penalty\nas a punishment for child rape. Exec. Order No. 13447, 72\nFed. Reg. 56214 (2007). Based on these acts, there is\ninfinitely more reason to think that Congress and the\nPresident made a judgment regarding the appropriateness\nof the death penalty for child rape than there is to think\nthat the many non-enacting state legislatures upon which\nthe majority relies did so\u2014especially since it was widely\nbelieved that Coker took the capital-punishment option off\nthe table. See Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                    Statement of SCALIA, J.\n\n\n  Second, JUSTICE KENNEDY speculates that the Eighth\nAmendment may permit subjecting a member of the mili-\ntary to a means of punishment that would be cruel and\nunusual if inflicted upon a civilian for the same crime.\nThat is perhaps so where the fact of the malefactor\u2019s\nmembership in the Armed Forces makes the offense more\ngrievous. One can imagine, for example, a social judgment\nthat treason by a military officer who has sworn to defend\nhis country deserves the death penalty even though trea-\nson by a civilian does not. (That is not the social judgment\nour society has made, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a72381, but one can\nimagine it.)
