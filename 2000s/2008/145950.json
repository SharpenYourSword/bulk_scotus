LOUISIANA\n                 ON PETITION FOR REHEARING\n                          [October 1, 2008]\n\n  The opinion of the Court is modified by the addition of a\nfootnote at page 15, after the word “considered” in the last\nparagraph of Part III–A. The footnote is as follows:\n       * When issued and announced on June 25, 2008, the Court’s de­\n    cision neither noted nor discussed the military penalty for rape\n    under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. See 10 U. S. C.\n    §§856, 920; Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Part IV,\n    ¶45.f(1) (2008). In a petition for rehearing respondent argues that\n    the military penalty bears on our consideration of the question in\n    this case. For the reasons set forth in the statement respecting\n    the denial of rehearing, post, p. ___, we find that the military pen­\n    alty does not affect our reasoning or conclusions.\n\n  The dissenting opinion is modified as follows:\n  (1) By the addition of the words “a federal district court\nto impose” at page 13 between the words “a law permit­\nting” and the words “the death penalty” in the first para­\ngraph of Part I–E;\n  (2) By the addition of footnote 6 after the word “values”\nin said paragraph. The footnote is as follows:\n      6 Moreover, as noted in the petition for rehearing, the Uniform\n\n    Code of Military Justice permits such a sentence. See 10 U. S. C.\n    §856; Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, Part II, Ch. X,\n    Rule 1004(c)(9) (2008); id., Part IV, ¶45.f(1).\n\n  The petition for rehearing is denied.\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE ALITO would grant the\npetition for rehearing.\n2                  KENNEDY v. LOUISIANA\n\n                   Statement of KENNEDY, J.\n\n  Statement of JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and\nJUSTICE BREYER join, respecting the denial of rehearing.\n  In its petition for rehearing respondent argues that the\nmilitary penalty for rape, a congressional amendment of\nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in 2006, and\na related executive order in 2007 should alter the Court’s\nanalysis of the Eighth Amendment question in this case.\nAfter considering the petition as well as supplemental\nbriefs from the parties and the United States, the Court\nhas determined that rehearing is not warranted.\n  The military death penalty for rape has been the rule for\nmore than a century. As respondent acknowledges in its\npetition for rehearing, military law has included the death\npenalty for rape of a child or adult victim since at least\n1863. See §30, 12 Stat. 736. Since 1950, that punishment\nhas applied to peacetime offenses by members of the mili­\ntary. See Art. 120, 64 Stat. 140. The death penalty, how­\never, has not been carried out against a military offender\nfor almost 50 years. The last instance of military capital\npunishment, in 1961, was for the crimes of rape and at­\ntempted murder. See R. Paternoster, R. Brame, & S.\nBacon, The Death Penalty: America’s Experience with\nCapital Punishment 69 (2008). There are six individuals\nnow subject to a final sentence of death under the UCMJ,\nsee NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.,\nDeath Row U. S. A. 66 (Winter 2008), all of whom commit­\nted offenses that involved the death of a victim.\n   In 2006, Congress passed the National Defense Authori­\nzation Act, which authorized that year’s appropriations for\nmilitary and national-security activities. Pub L. 109–163.\nAlso in that bill, Congress revised the military’s sexual-\nassault statutes, in part by reclassifying the UCMJ’s\noffense of rape as two separate crimes: adult rape and\nchild rape. §552(a)(1), 119 Stat. 3257. It is unclear what\neffect, if any, that reclassification worked on the availabil­\n                 Cite as: 554 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\n\n                   Statement of KENNEDY, J.\n\nity of the military death penalty. Pending the President’s\nsetting the maximum penalty for adult rape and child\nrape, Congress included a temporary provision applying\nthe existing maximum punishment of death for rape as\nthe “interim maximum punishment” for those crimes. Id.,\n§552(b)(1), at 3263; see also 10 U. S. C. §856. But Con­\ngress also removed from the text of the statute itself, §920,\nthe specific authorization of “death” as a punishment; the\nnew statute provides only that adult rape and child rape\nshall be punished “as a court-martial may direct.” For his\npart, the President later left in place, in the Manual for\nCourts-Martial, the availability of the death penalty for\nrape of an adult or child victim. Exec. Order No. 13447, 72\nFed. Reg. 56214 (2007); Manual for Courts-Martial,\nUnited States, Part IV, ¶45.f(1) (2008). The parties dis­\nagree on the effect of Congress’ and the President’s actions\nin light of 10 U. S. C. §818, which allows imposition of the\ndeath penalty only “when specifically authorized by this\nchapter.”\n   In any event, authorization of the death penalty in the\nmilitary sphere does not indicate that the penalty is con­\nstitutional in the civilian context. The military death\npenalty for rape was in effect before the decisions in\nFurman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), and\nCoker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977); and when the\nCourt surveyed state and federal law in Coker, it made no\nmention of the military penalty. See id., at 595–596, 593,\nand n. 6 (plurality opinion) (not including the military as a\n“jurisdiction in the United States” that authorized the\ndeath penalty for rape, and naming the Federal Govern­\nment among jurisdictions that recognized the death pen­\nalty for rape prior to Furman but citing only the nonmili­\ntary provision). The same is true of more recent Eighth\nAmendment cases in the civilian context. See Enmund v.\nFlorida, 458 U. S. 782, 789–793 (1982); Tison v. Arizona,\n481 U. S. 137, 152–154 (1987). This case, too, involves the\n4                 KENNEDY v. LOUISIANA\n\n                   Statement of KENNEDY, J.\n\napplication of the Eighth Amendment to civilian law; and\nso we need not decide whether certain considerations\nmight justify differences in the application of the Cruel\nand Unusual Punishments Clause to military cases (a\nmatter not presented here for our decision). Cf. Loving v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 748, 755 (1996).\n   That the Manual for Courts-Martial retains the death\npenalty for rape of a child or an adult when committed by\na member of the military does not draw into question our\nconclusions that there is a consensus against the death\npenalty for the crime in the civilian context and that the\npenalty here is unconstitutional. The laws of the separate\nStates, which have responsibility for the administration of\nthe criminal law for their civilian populations, are entitled\nto considerable weight over and above the punishments\nCongress and the President consider appropriate in the\nmilitary context. The more relevant federal benchmark is\nfederal criminal law that applies to civilians, and that law\ndoes not permit the death penalty for child rape. Until the\npetition for rehearing, none of the briefs or submissions\nfiled by the parties or the amici in this case cited or dis­\ncussed the UCMJ provisions.\n</pre>", "id": 145950, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2008/10/01/Kennedy_v._Louisiana_2.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                    Cite as: 554 U.
