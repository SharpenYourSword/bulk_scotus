UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 07–9267. Decided June 23, 2008 \n\n\n  The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are\ngranted. The judgment is vacated and the case is re-\nmanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit for further consideration in light of the\nposition asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for\nthe United States filed May 12, 2008.\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.\n   Petitioner pleaded guilty to distributing crack cocaine.\nHe waived “ ‘all appellate issues that might have been\navailable if he had exercised his right to trial’ ” but re-\nserved the right to appeal the validity of his guilty plea.\nSee No: 06C1304, Memorandum Opinion and Order (ED\nIll., May 2, 2006), App. B to Pet. for Cert. 3. Petitioner\nnonetheless (allegedly) asked his attorney to file a notice\nof appeal to argue that the substance he distributed was\nnot crack cocaine. His attorney filed nothing. On collat-\neral review, petitioner claimed that his attorney’s failure\nwas ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court\ndenied the claim, finding that any appeal his attorney\nmight have pursued was doomed because he waived his\nright to appeal and because petitioner had expressly iden-\ntified the substance as crack cocaine in his guilty plea. On\nappeal, the Court of Appeals asked the parties to address\nthe effect of its decision in Nunez v. United States, 495\nF. 3d 544 (CA7 2007), which held that Nunez’s plea\nagreement waived his right to bring an identical ineffec-\n2             STEPHENSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntive-assistance claim on collateral review. The Govern-\nment argued that petitioner’s case was materially indis-\ntinguishable from Nunez. The Court of Appeals summa-\nrily affirmed the District Court’s judgment.\n   Petitioner asks us to consider his ineffective-assistance\nclaim. That claim does not warrant our review, so I would\ndeny his petition for certiorari. In the Brief for United\nStates, the Solicitor General suggests that we GVR—grant\nthe petition, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to\nthe Court of Appeals. He contends (contrary to the Gov-\nernment’s position below) that petitioner’s waiver is less\ncomprehensive than the waiver in Nunez. And since he\nthinks that the Court of Appeals’ reading of the waiver in\nNunez was wrong (he has asked us to GVR in Nunez’s case\nfor that very reason), the Solicitor General concludes that,\ninasmuch as the Court of Appeals might have agreed with\nthe Government’s (now repudiated) position below, the\nreasoning behind the judgment below may be wrong. The\nSolicitor General does not challenge the judgment below,\nnor does he take a position on petitioner’s ineffective-\nassistance claim, insofar as that may have been the basis\nfor the Court of Appeals’ summary order.\n   As I state in my dissent in Nunez v. United States, ante,\nat ___, the Solicitor General’s confession of error in the\nCourt of Appeals’ reasoning, but not its judgment, does not\njustify entry of a GVR order. That disposition is especially\ninappropriate in this case because we cannot even be sure\nthat the Court of Appeals’ summary order was premised\non the alleged error. See Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S.\n163, 184–186 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). For all we\nknow, the Court of Appeals identified a difference in the\nplea agreements and therefore summarily affirmed be-\ncause it agreed with the District Court’s reasoning on the\nmerits of petitioner’s ineffective-assistance claim.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145951, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2008/06/23/Stephenson_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 554 U.
