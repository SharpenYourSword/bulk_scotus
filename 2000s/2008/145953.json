GENE M. JOHNSON, DIRECTOR, \n\n    VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS \n\n ON APPLICATION FOR STAY AND ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF\n\n  CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n\n               FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [May 27, 2008] \n\n\n   The application for stay of execution of sentence of death\npresented to THE CHIEF JUSTICE and by him referred to\nthe Court is denied. The petition for writ of certiorari is\ndenied.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG joins,\ndissenting.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals upholding peti-\ntioner’s death sentence was filed on March 11, 2008.\nAlthough the deadline for filing a petition for certiorari\nwill not pass until next month, Virginia plans to execute\npetitioner this evening. This execution date requires us\neither to enter a stay or to give petitioner’s claim less\nthorough consideration than we give claims routinely filed\nby defendants in noncapital cases. In order to ensure\npetitioner the same procedural safeguards available to\nnoncapital defendants, I would grant his application for a\nstay of execution. See Emmett v. Kelly, 552 U. S. ___\n(2007) (statement respecting denial of certiorari) (“Both\nthe interest in avoiding irreversible error in capital cases,\nand the interest in the efficient management of our docket,\nwould be served by a routine practice of staying all exe-\ncutions scheduled in advance of the completion of our\nreview [in the ordinary course] of the denial of a capital\ndefendant’s first application for a federal writ of habeas\ncorpus”).\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145953/", "sha1": "8f7e6c5a658f99afb4ed3b96268755f71fa3e03e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:49"}
