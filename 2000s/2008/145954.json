GENE M. \n\n     JOHNSON, DIRECTOR, VIRGINIA DEPART- \n\n          MENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL. \n\n ON MOTION TO VACATE STAY OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE\n\n                     OF DEATH\n\n               No. 07A304.   Decided May 19, 2008 \n\n\n   The motion to vacate the stay of execution of sentence of\ndeath issued by the Court on October 17, 2007, is granted.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER and\nJUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.\n   In 2001, Christopher Scott Emmett was convicted of\ncapital murder and sentenced to death. On April 19, 2007,\nEmmett filed suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, asserting that\nVirginia\u2019s lethal injection protocol violated the Eighth\nAmendment. The District Court for the Eastern District\nof Virginia granted summary judgment to the State, find-\ning that Emmett failed to submit sufficient evidence to\nshow that Virginia\u2019s method of execution created a \u201csub-\nstantial risk that he will experience unnecessary pain that\nis serious or significant\u201d or that prison officials were delib-\nerately indifferent to such a risk. 511 F. Supp. 2d 634,\n640, and n. 5 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   On September 25, 2007, five days after the District\nCourt denied relief, Emmett filed a notice of appeal with\nthe Fourth Circuit. On that same date, this Court granted\ncertiorari in Baze v. Rees, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), to consider\nthe constitutionality of Kentucky\u2019s lethal injection proto-\ncol. As Emmett\u2019s October 17th execution date approached\n(without a final decision having been rendered by the\nFourth Circuit), Emmett filed an application for a stay of\nexecution in this Court. We granted his application and\nentered a stay \u201cpending final disposition of the appeal by\n2                  EMMETT v. JOHNSON\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nor further order of this Court.\u201d 552 U. S. ___.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia has moved to vacate\nthat stay. The Fourth Circuit has not rendered a final\ndisposition on the appeal, but it has acted swiftly in the\nmonth since we issued our decision in Baze; it requested\nadditional briefing on the impact of Baze the day after\nthat opinion issued, received those briefs on May 2, and\nheard oral argument on Wednesday, May 14. I therefore\nbelieve we should leave our stay in place until the Fourth\nCircuit has an adequate opportunity to render a decision\non the merits of Emmett\u2019s claim. The parties\u2019 filings with\nthis Court highlight the existence of factual disputes\nconcerning Virginia\u2019s lethal injection protocol, including\nwhether it is substantially similar to the Kentucky proto-\ncol we declined to strike down in Baze. Because the\nFourth Circuit has the trial record before it, and also has\nthe benefit of extensive briefing and argument, it is in a\nsignificantly better position than we are to make these\nfactual judgments when it rules on the merits of Emmett\u2019s\nappeal.\n  Although the parties are of course free to request a stay\nfrom the Fourth Circuit\u2014a request that the court may\nwell grant in order to complete its consideration of Em-\nmett\u2019s appeal without the pressure of a looming execution\ndate\u2014I would not require the parties to shoulder the\nadditional burden of filing superfluous papers when sim-\nply leaving our stay in place until final disposition by the\nCourt of Appeals would also give the Fourth Circuit an\nopportunity to consider these important issues in the\nregular course. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n",
