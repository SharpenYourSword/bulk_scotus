Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991), the Court held\nthat “if a State decides to permit consideration of” victim\nimpact “evidence, ‘the Eighth Amendment erects no per se\nbar.’ ” Id., at 831 (O’Connor, J., concurring). But three of\nthe six Payne-majority Justices, after so characterizing the\nCourt’s holding, added that “[i]f, in a particular case, a\nwitness’ testimony or a prosecutor’s remark so infects the\nsentencing proceeding as to render it fundamentally un\nfair, the defendant may seek appropriate relief under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Ibid.\n   The question here is whether admission at a death\npenalty proceeding of a particular film about the victim’s\nlife goes beyond due process bounds. I would concede that\nthe film at issue will help the jury understand “the full\nextent of the harm caused by the crime, including its\nimpact on the victim’s family and community.” Id., at 830.\nIt will help “remind the jury that the person whose life\nwas taken was a unique human being.” Id., at 831.

That emotional impact is driven in\npart by the music, the mother’s voiceover, and the use of\nscenes without victim or family (for example, the film\nconcludes with a clip of wild horses running free).
