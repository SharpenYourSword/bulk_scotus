Decided November 10, 2008 \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from the denial of the\npetitions for writs of certiorari.\n   I would grant certiorari in these cases for many of the\nreasons set forth in JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 separate statement.\nIn Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991), the Court held\nthat \u201cif a State decides to permit consideration of\u201d victim\nimpact \u201cevidence, \u2018the Eighth Amendment erects no per se\nbar.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 831 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). But three of\nthe six Payne-majority Justices, after so characterizing the\nCourt\u2019s holding, added that \u201c[i]f, in a particular case, a\nwitness\u2019 testimony or a prosecutor\u2019s remark so infects the\nsentencing proceeding as to render it fundamentally un\nfair, the defendant may seek appropriate relief under the\nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Ibid.\n   The question here is whether admission at a death\npenalty proceeding of a particular film about the victim\u2019s\nlife goes beyond due process bounds. I would concede that\nthe film at issue will help the jury understand \u201cthe full\nextent of the harm caused by the crime, including its\nimpact on the victim\u2019s family and community.\u201d Id., at 830.\nIt will help \u201cremind the jury that the person whose life\nwas taken was a unique human being.\u201d Id., at 831. And it\n2                  KELLY v. CALIFORNIA\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwill give the jury, at the least, \u201c \u2018a quick glimpse of the\nlife\u2019 \u201d the defendant \u201c \u2018chose to extinguish.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 830.\nThe film, in my view, is poignant, tasteful, artistic, and,\nabove all, moving.\n   On the other hand, the film\u2019s personal, emotional, and\nartistic attributes themselves create the legal problem.\nThey render the film\u2019s purely emotional impact strong,\nperhaps unusually so. That emotional impact is driven in\npart by the music, the mother\u2019s voiceover, and the use of\nscenes without victim or family (for example, the film\nconcludes with a clip of wild horses running free). Those\naspects of the film tell the jury little or nothing about the\ncrime\u2019s \u201ccircumstances,\u201d People v. Robinson, 37 Cal. 4th\n592, 650, 171 P. 3d 363, 402 (2005) (permitting the intro\nduction of penalty-phase victim impact evidence as a\n\u201ccircumstance of the crime\u201d under California Penal Code\nAnn. \u00a7190.3 factor (a) (West 2008)), but nonetheless pro\nduce a powerful purely emotional impact. It is this mini\nmal probity coupled with the video\u2019s purely emotional\nimpact that may call due process protections into play.\n   This Court has made clear that \u201cany decision to impose\nthe death sentence\u201d must \u201cbe, and appear to be, based on\nreason rather than caprice or emotion.\u201d Gardner v. Flor\nida, 430 U. S. 349, 358 (1977) (plurality opinion). A re\nview of the film itself, http://www.supremecourtus.gov/\nopinions/video/kelly_v_california.html, along with the\nsources to which JUSTICE STEVENS refers, makes clear\nthat the due process problem of disproportionately power\nful emotion is a serious one. Cf. United States v. Johnson,\n362 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1107 (N D Iowa 2005) (describing\n\u201cjuror\u2019s sobbing\u201d that \u201cstill rings\u201d in judge\u2019s \u201cears\u201d). I\nunderstand the difficulty of drawing a line between what\nis, and is not, constitutionally admissible in this area. But\nexamples can help elucidate constitutional guidelines.\nAnd in my view, the Court should grant certiorari and\nconsider these cases in an effort to do so.\n",
