The two men\nthen fled the scene on their bicycles. Both were arrested\nwithin hours; petitioner was found with Gresham’s blood\non his clothes and Gresham’s keys in his pocket. The\nknife used in the attack and a pistol were discovered\nnearby. Ibid.\n   Petitioner was charged with malice murder, felony\nmurder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, attempted\nburglary, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nId., at 774, n. 1, 653 S. E. 2d, at 442, n. 1. A jury found\nhim guilty on all charges and recommended the death\npenalty. Ibid. In particular, the jury unanimously found\nfive aggravating factors: that the murder was committed\nwhile petitioner was engaged in an armed robbery; that\nthe murder was committed for the purpose of receiving\nmoney or a thing of monetary value; that the murder\ninvolved torture; that the murder involved aggravated\nbattery; and that the murder was outrageously or wan\ntonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved deprav\nity of mind. Id., at 781, 653 S. E. 2d, at 447. The trial\ncourt agreed with the jury’s recommendation and imposed\na sentence of death for the malice-murder conviction.

Code\nAnn. §17–10–35(c)(3). The court first determined that the\nlife sentence imposed on Griffin for the same murder did\nnot render petitioner’s death sentence disproportionate.\nPetitioner was more culpable for the murder, and Griffin\nwas ineligible for the death penalty because he was ad\njudged mentally retarded. Id., at 782, 653 S.

In Pulley, the Court considered the his\ntory of Georgia’s capital sentencing scheme and dismissed\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ assertion that the constitutionality of\nGeorgia’s scheme had rested on its willingness to conduct\nproportionality review. Id., at 44–46, 50; id., at 58–59\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). The Court explained that, although it may have\nemphasized the role of proportionality review as “an addi\ntional safeguard against arbitrarily imposed death sen\ntences” in Gregg, supra, and Zant, supra, it had never held\n4                       WALKER v.

JUSTICE STEVENS acknowledged in his Pul\nley concurrence that his interpretation of Gregg and Zant\ndiffered from the Court’s. 465 U. S., at 54. He continues\nto adhere to his distinctive interpretation of Gregg and\nZant today, ante, at 2–3, 6, and questions whether the\nGeorgia scheme as currently administered provides the\nadditional review that he believes is constitutionally\nrequired. But, under this Court’s precedents, Georgia is\nnot required to provide any proportionality review at all.\n   Having elected to provide the additional protection of\nproportionality review, there can be no question that the\nway in which the Georgia Supreme Court administered\nthat review in this case raised no constitutional issue.\nThe State’s proportionality review was lauded in Gregg as\na protective measure that would ensure that “[i]f a time\ncomes when juries generally do not impose the death\nsentence in a certain kind of murder case, . . . no defen\ndant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a\nsentence of death” because there will be no comparable\ncases to support a finding of proportionality. 428 U. S., at\n206 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).\nThen, in McCleskey, 481 U. S., at 306, this Court upheld\nthe proportionality review conducted by the Georgia Su\npreme Court and recognized that the Georgia court’s\nconclusion was supported by “an appendix containing\ncitations to 13 cases involving generally similar murders.’’1\n——————\n    1 JUSTICE\n            STEVENS accuses the Georgia Supreme Court in this case of\nengaging in “utterly perfunctory review” because it included “a string\ncitation of 21 cases in which the jury imposed a death sentence” and\n“ma[de] no reference to the facts of those cases or to the aggravating\ncircumstances found by the jury.” Ante, at 4. The accusation is entirely\nwithout foundation. The proportionality review upheld by this Court in\nMcCleskey also contained a string citation of cases that failed to include\nthe detailed discussion of each case’s specific facts that JUSTICE\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Id., at 283–285; 282 Ga., at 774, 653 S. E. 2d at\n442.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS nevertheless asserts that there is a\n“special risk of arbitrariness in cases that involve black\ndefendants and white victims,” ante, at 3, and that the\nGeorgia Supreme Court should have “looked outside the\nuniverse of cases in which the jury imposed a death sen\ntence,” ante, at 4–5. But he once again fails to acknowl\nedge that the Court considered and rejected similar argu\nments in McCleskey, see 481 U. S., at 306–319. The\nMcCleskey Court considered whether a study based on\nGeorgia’s application of the death penalty in the 1970’s\nshowed a “major systemic defec[t]” in sentencing that\ncorrelates with race. Id., at 313 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And although that study found that the death\npenalty was imposed more often when a black defendant\nmurdered a white victim than when a white defendant\nmurdered a black victim, id., at 286, the Court concluded\nthat the study “[a]t most . . . indicate[d] a discrepancy that\nappears to correlate with race,” id., at 312. According to\nthe Court, “[a]pparent discrepancies are an inevitable part\nof our criminal justice system,” ibid., and there are other\naspects of Georgia’s discretionary scheme that could ex\nplain the apparent discrepancy, id., at 311–313.

S., at 204, n. 56 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).2 As a result, to the\nextent that JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that the Court’s\n\n——————\n  2 In Gregg, 428 U. S., at 204, n. 56, the Court noted that the Georgia\n\nSupreme Court “has the authority to consider such cases” involving\n“nonappealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed and\ncases involving homicides where a capital conviction is not obtained”\nand that it “does consider appealed murder cases where a life sentence\nhas been imposed.” Petitioner contends, and JUSTICE STEVENS accepts,\nthat the Georgia Supreme Court no longer considers murder cases\nwhere a life sentence has been imposed based on a law review note that\nstudied the proportionality review conducted in 55 capital cases re\nviewed by the Georgia Supreme Court between 1994 and 2004. Ante, at\n7; Pet. for Cert. 23 (citing Note, Reviewing the Georgia Supreme\nCourt’s Efforts at Proportionality Review, 39 Ga. L. Rev. 631 (2005)).\nBut petitioner and JUSTICE STEVENS do not point to any statement from\nthe Georgia Supreme Court that such cases are no longer considered\nand there is no reason to believe that the court has changed its practice\nsimply because its decisions do not explicitly cite to cases involving life\nsentences. See Pulley v. Harris, 465 U. S., 37, 48, n. 8 (1984) (“[T]he\nfact that . . . [a] court was not explicit about comparative review does\nnot mean none was undertaken”). Moreover, in this case, the Georgia\nSupreme Court considered a life sentence in its proportionality review\nas it explicitly evaluated whether the sentence given Griffin for the\nsame murder made petitioner’s death sentence disproportionate.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

But McCleskey, Pulley, Zant, and Gregg remain the\nlaw. Because the Georgia Supreme Court applied them\nfaithfully and without any error, I concur in the denial of\ncertiorari.\n</pre>", "id": 145972, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2008/10/20/Walker_v._Georgia.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 555 U.

GEORGIA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\n   The McCleskey Court also considered the universe of\ncases included in the Georgia Supreme Court’s propor\ntionality analysis and held that “absent a showing that the\nGeorgia capital punishment system operates in an arbi\ntrary and capricious manner, [a defendant] cannot prove a\nconstitutional violation by demonstrating that other de\nfendants who may be similarly situated did not receive the\ndeath penalty.” Id., at 306–307 (emphasis in original).\nThe Court in Gregg also considered the issue and held that\nGeorgia’s scheme would not be ineffective even if, in prac\ntice, the Georgia Supreme Court did not consider “nonap\npealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed\nand cases involving homicides where a capital conviction\nis not obtained.” 428 U.

S., at 204, n. 56, the Court noted that the Georgia\n\nSupreme Court “has the authority to consider such cases” involving\n“nonappealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed and\ncases involving homicides where a capital conviction is not obtained”\nand that it “does consider appealed murder cases where a life sentence\nhas been imposed.” Petitioner contends, and JUSTICE STEVENS accepts,\nthat the Georgia Supreme Court no longer considers murder cases\nwhere a life sentence has been imposed based on a law review note that\nstudied the proportionality review conducted in 55 capital cases re\nviewed by the Georgia Supreme Court between 1994 and 2004. Ante, at\n7; Pet. for Cert. 23 (citing Note, Reviewing the Georgia Supreme\nCourt’s Efforts at Proportionality Review, 39 Ga. L. Rev. 631 (2005)).\nBut petitioner and JUSTICE STEVENS do not point to any statement from\nthe Georgia Supreme Court that such cases are no longer considered\nand there is no reason to believe that the court has changed its practice\nsimply because its decisions do not explicitly cite to cases involving life\nsentences. See Pulley v. Harris, 465 U. S., 37, 48, n. 8 (1984) (“[T]he\nfact that . . . [a] court was not explicit about comparative review does\nnot mean none was undertaken”). Moreover, in this case, the Georgia\nSupreme Court considered a life sentence in its proportionality review\nas it explicitly evaluated whether the sentence given Griffin for the\nsame murder made petitioner’s death sentence disproportionate.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

But McCleskey, Pulley, Zant, and Gregg remain the\nlaw. Because the Georgia Supreme Court applied them\nfaithfully and without any error, I concur in the denial of\ncertiorari.\n", "precedential_status": "Relating-to", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145972/", "sha1": "c46f8fa8ea207929e4e51fb827acf159827fac5b", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:59"}
