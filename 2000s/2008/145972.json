GEORGIA\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                  COURT OF GEORGIA\n\n             No. 08\u20135385. Decided October 20, 2008 \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the denial of the peti\ntion of certiorari.\n   Petitioner brutally murdered Lynwood Ray Gresham,\nand was sentenced to death for his crime. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS objects to the proportionality review undertaken\nby the Georgia Supreme Court on direct review of peti\ntioner\u2019s capital sentence. The Georgia Supreme Court,\nhowever, afforded petitioner\u2019s sentence precisely the same\nproportionality review endorsed by this Court in\nMcCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S. 279 (1987); Pulley v. Harris,\n465 U. S. 37 (1984); Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862\n(1983); and Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976), and\ndescribed in Pulley as a \u201csafeguard against arbitrary or\ncapricious sentencing\u201d additional to that which is constitu\ntionally required, Pulley, supra, at 45. Because the Geor\ngia Supreme Court made no error in applying its statuto\nrily required proportionality review in this case, I concur\nin the denial of certiorari.\n   In May 1999, petitioner recruited Gary Lee Griffin to\nhelp him \u201crob and kill a rich white man\u201d and \u201ctake the\nmoney, take the jewels.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 5 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted); 282 Ga. 774, 774\u2013775, 653 S. E. 2d\n439, 443, (2007). Petitioner and Griffin packed two bicy\ncles in a borrowed car, dressed in black, and took a knife\nand stun gun to Gresham\u2019s house. Petitioner lured\nGresham outside, Pet. for Cert. 5, stabbed him 12 times in\nthe chest and back, and dragged him to the side of the\nhouse to die, 282 Ga., at 775, 653 S. E. 2d, at 443. Griffin\nfound Gresham\u2019s wallet and house keys and gave the keys\n2                   WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nto petitioner, who said he had \u201c \u2018one more to kill.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\nHowever, because Mrs. Gresham and her daughter had\nbeen inside their house and had locked the door with chain\nand foot locks, petitioner did not succeed. The two men\nthen fled the scene on their bicycles. Both were arrested\nwithin hours; petitioner was found with Gresham\u2019s blood\non his clothes and Gresham\u2019s keys in his pocket. The\nknife used in the attack and a pistol were discovered\nnearby. Ibid.\n   Petitioner was charged with malice murder, felony\nmurder, armed robbery, aggravated assault, attempted\nburglary, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nId., at 774, n. 1, 653 S. E. 2d, at 442, n. 1. A jury found\nhim guilty on all charges and recommended the death\npenalty. Ibid. In particular, the jury unanimously found\nfive aggravating factors: that the murder was committed\nwhile petitioner was engaged in an armed robbery; that\nthe murder was committed for the purpose of receiving\nmoney or a thing of monetary value; that the murder\ninvolved torture; that the murder involved aggravated\nbattery; and that the murder was outrageously or wan\ntonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved deprav\nity of mind. Id., at 781, 653 S. E. 2d, at 447. The trial\ncourt agreed with the jury\u2019s recommendation and imposed\na sentence of death for the malice-murder conviction. The\ncourt also imposed a life sentence for armed robbery and\nconsecutive sentences of 20, 10, and 5 years for the re\nmaining convictions. Id., at 774, n. 1, 653 S. E. 2d, at 442,\nn. 1.\n   On direct appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court reviewed\neach statutory aggravating circumstance supporting the\ndeath sentence, see Ga. Code Ann. \u00a717\u201310\u201335(c)(2) (2008),\nand struck two of them\u2014murder involving torture and\nmurder involving aggravated battery\u2014because they var\nied from the applicable statutory language, 282 Ga., at\n781, 653 S. E. 2d, at 447; Ga. Code Ann. \u00a717\u201310\u201330(b)(7).\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nWith three valid statutory aggravating factors remaining\nand the full weight of the evidence supporting petitioner\u2019s\nconviction, the Georgia Supreme Court found that peti\ntioner was eligible for the death sentence under state law.\n   The Georgia Supreme Court then reviewed petitioner\u2019s\ndeath sentence to determine whether it was \u201cexcessive or\ndisproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\nconsidering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Ga. Code\nAnn. \u00a717\u201310\u201335(c)(3). The court first determined that the\nlife sentence imposed on Griffin for the same murder did\nnot render petitioner\u2019s death sentence disproportionate.\nPetitioner was more culpable for the murder, and Griffin\nwas ineligible for the death penalty because he was ad\njudged mentally retarded. Id., at 782, 653 S. E. 2d, 447.\nThe Georgia Supreme Court then examined 21 cases in\nwhich a defendant received the death penalty for a \u201cdelib\nerate plan to kill and killing for the purpose of receiving\nsomething of monetary value.\u201d Ibid., 653 S. E. 2d, 448.\nAfter reviewing these cases, the court concluded that\npetitioner\u2019s death sentence was proportional to other\ndeath sentences imposed in Georgia and affirmed. Ibid.\n   There is nothing constitutionally defective about the\nGeorgia Supreme Court\u2019s determination. Proportionality\nreview is not constitutionally required in any form. Geor\ngia simply has elected, as a matter of state law, to provide\nan additional protection for capital defendants. Pulley,\n465 U. S., at 45. In Pulley, the Court considered the his\ntory of Georgia\u2019s capital sentencing scheme and dismissed\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 assertion that the constitutionality of\nGeorgia\u2019s scheme had rested on its willingness to conduct\nproportionality review. Id., at 44\u201346, 50; id., at 58\u201359\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). The Court explained that, although it may have\nemphasized the role of proportionality review as \u201can addi\ntional safeguard against arbitrarily imposed death sen\ntences\u201d in Gregg, supra, and Zant, supra, it had never held\n4                       WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nthat \u201cwithout comparative proportionality review the\n[Georgia] statute would be unconstitutional.\u201d Pulley,\nsupra, at 50. JUSTICE STEVENS acknowledged in his Pul\nley concurrence that his interpretation of Gregg and Zant\ndiffered from the Court\u2019s. 465 U. S., at 54. He continues\nto adhere to his distinctive interpretation of Gregg and\nZant today, ante, at 2\u20133, 6, and questions whether the\nGeorgia scheme as currently administered provides the\nadditional review that he believes is constitutionally\nrequired. But, under this Court\u2019s precedents, Georgia is\nnot required to provide any proportionality review at all.\n   Having elected to provide the additional protection of\nproportionality review, there can be no question that the\nway in which the Georgia Supreme Court administered\nthat review in this case raised no constitutional issue.\nThe State\u2019s proportionality review was lauded in Gregg as\na protective measure that would ensure that \u201c[i]f a time\ncomes when juries generally do not impose the death\nsentence in a certain kind of murder case, . . . no defen\ndant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a\nsentence of death\u201d because there will be no comparable\ncases to support a finding of proportionality. 428 U. S., at\n206 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).\nThen, in McCleskey, 481 U. S., at 306, this Court upheld\nthe proportionality review conducted by the Georgia Su\npreme Court and recognized that the Georgia court\u2019s\nconclusion was supported by \u201can appendix containing\ncitations to 13 cases involving generally similar murders.\u2019\u20191\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 JUSTICE\n            STEVENS accuses the Georgia Supreme Court in this case of\nengaging in \u201cutterly perfunctory review\u201d because it included \u201ca string\ncitation of 21 cases in which the jury imposed a death sentence\u201d and\n\u201cma[de] no reference to the facts of those cases or to the aggravating\ncircumstances found by the jury.\u201d Ante, at 4. The accusation is entirely\nwithout foundation. The proportionality review upheld by this Court in\nMcCleskey also contained a string citation of cases that failed to include\nthe detailed discussion of each case\u2019s specific facts that JUSTICE\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                   5\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nIn McCleskey, as here, the trial court followed the jury\u2019s\nrecommendation and imposed a death sentence for a black\ndefendant who murdered a white victim during an armed\nrobbery. Id., at 283\u2013285; 282 Ga., at 774, 653 S. E. 2d at\n442.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS nevertheless asserts that there is a\n\u201cspecial risk of arbitrariness in cases that involve black\ndefendants and white victims,\u201d ante, at 3, and that the\nGeorgia Supreme Court should have \u201clooked outside the\nuniverse of cases in which the jury imposed a death sen\ntence,\u201d ante, at 4\u20135. But he once again fails to acknowl\nedge that the Court considered and rejected similar argu\nments in McCleskey, see 481 U. S., at 306\u2013319. The\nMcCleskey Court considered whether a study based on\nGeorgia\u2019s application of the death penalty in the 1970\u2019s\nshowed a \u201cmajor systemic defec[t]\u201d in sentencing that\ncorrelates with race. Id., at 313 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And although that study found that the death\npenalty was imposed more often when a black defendant\nmurdered a white victim than when a white defendant\nmurdered a black victim, id., at 286, the Court concluded\nthat the study \u201c[a]t most . . . indicate[d] a discrepancy that\nappears to correlate with race,\u201d id., at 312. According to\nthe Court, \u201c[a]pparent discrepancies are an inevitable part\nof our criminal justice system,\u201d ibid., and there are other\naspects of Georgia\u2019s discretionary scheme that could ex\nplain the apparent discrepancy, id., at 311\u2013313. The\nstudy did not \u201cdemonstrate a constitutionally significant\nrisk of racial bias affecting the Georgia capital sentencing\nprocess.\u201d Id., at 313.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSTEVENS suggests is somehow required by the Constitution. See\nMcCleskey v. State, 245 Ga. 108, 116\u2013117, 263 S. E. 2d 146, 152 (1980).\nThe only difference between the string citation here and the string\ncitation approved by this Court in McCleskey is that the citation here\nreflects an examination of at least 50% more cases.\n6                        WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\n   The McCleskey Court also considered the universe of\ncases included in the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s propor\ntionality analysis and held that \u201cabsent a showing that the\nGeorgia capital punishment system operates in an arbi\ntrary and capricious manner, [a defendant] cannot prove a\nconstitutional violation by demonstrating that other de\nfendants who may be similarly situated did not receive the\ndeath penalty.\u201d Id., at 306\u2013307 (emphasis in original).\nThe Court in Gregg also considered the issue and held that\nGeorgia\u2019s scheme would not be ineffective even if, in prac\ntice, the Georgia Supreme Court did not consider \u201cnonap\npealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed\nand cases involving homicides where a capital conviction\nis not obtained.\u201d 428 U. S., at 204, n. 56 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).2 As a result, to the\nextent that JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that the Court\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In Gregg, 428 U. S., at 204, n. 56, the Court noted that the Georgia\n\nSupreme Court \u201chas the authority to consider such cases\u201d involving\n\u201cnonappealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed and\ncases involving homicides where a capital conviction is not obtained\u201d\nand that it \u201cdoes consider appealed murder cases where a life sentence\nhas been imposed.\u201d Petitioner contends, and JUSTICE STEVENS accepts,\nthat the Georgia Supreme Court no longer considers murder cases\nwhere a life sentence has been imposed based on a law review note that\nstudied the proportionality review conducted in 55 capital cases re\nviewed by the Georgia Supreme Court between 1994 and 2004. Ante, at\n7; Pet. for Cert. 23 (citing Note, Reviewing the Georgia Supreme\nCourt\u2019s Efforts at Proportionality Review, 39 Ga. L. Rev. 631 (2005)).\nBut petitioner and JUSTICE STEVENS do not point to any statement from\nthe Georgia Supreme Court that such cases are no longer considered\nand there is no reason to believe that the court has changed its practice\nsimply because its decisions do not explicitly cite to cases involving life\nsentences. See Pulley v. Harris, 465 U. S., 37, 48, n. 8 (1984) (\u201c[T]he\nfact that . . . [a] court was not explicit about comparative review does\nnot mean none was undertaken\u201d). Moreover, in this case, the Georgia\nSupreme Court considered a life sentence in its proportionality review\nas it explicitly evaluated whether the sentence given Griffin for the\nsame murder made petitioner\u2019s death sentence disproportionate.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nprecedent requires consideration of cases where the death\npenalty was not imposed, he is simply wrong.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 disagreement with this Court\u2019s death\npenalty precedents formed the basis for his dissent from\nthe Court\u2019s decision in McCleskey and his concurrence in\nPulley, and he stands by those decisions in his statement\ntoday. But McCleskey, Pulley, Zant, and Gregg remain the\nlaw. Because the Georgia Supreme Court applied them\nfaithfully and without any error, I concur in the denial of\ncertiorari.\n",

S., at 306, this Court upheld\nthe proportionality review conducted by the Georgia Su\npreme Court and recognized that the Georgia court\u2019s\nconclusion was supported by \u201can appendix containing\ncitations to 13 cases involving generally similar murders.\u2019\u20191\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 JUSTICE\n            STEVENS accuses the Georgia Supreme Court in this case of\nengaging in \u201cutterly perfunctory review\u201d because it included \u201ca string\ncitation of 21 cases in which the jury imposed a death sentence\u201d and\n\u201cma[de] no reference to the facts of those cases or to the aggravating\ncircumstances found by the jury.\u201d Ante, at 4. The accusation is entirely\nwithout foundation. The proportionality review upheld by this Court in\nMcCleskey also contained a string citation of cases that failed to include\nthe detailed discussion of each case\u2019s specific facts that JUSTICE\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)                   5\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nIn McCleskey, as here, the trial court followed the jury\u2019s\nrecommendation and imposed a death sentence for a black\ndefendant who murdered a white victim during an armed\nrobbery. Id., at 283\u2013285; 282 Ga., at 774, 653 S. E. 2d at\n442.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS nevertheless asserts that there is a\n\u201cspecial risk of arbitrariness in cases that involve black\ndefendants and white victims,\u201d ante, at 3, and that the\nGeorgia Supreme Court should have \u201clooked outside the\nuniverse of cases in which the jury imposed a death sen\ntence,\u201d ante, at 4\u20135. But he once again fails to acknowl\nedge that the Court considered and rejected similar argu\nments in McCleskey, see 481 U. S., at 306\u2013319. The\nMcCleskey Court considered whether a study based on\nGeorgia\u2019s application of the death penalty in the 1970\u2019s\nshowed a \u201cmajor systemic defec[t]\u201d in sentencing that\ncorrelates with race. Id., at 313 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And although that study found that the death\npenalty was imposed more often when a black defendant\nmurdered a white victim than when a white defendant\nmurdered a black victim, id., at 286, the Court concluded\nthat the study \u201c[a]t most . . . indicate[d] a discrepancy that\nappears to correlate with race,\u201d id., at 312. According to\nthe Court, \u201c[a]pparent discrepancies are an inevitable part\nof our criminal justice system,\u201d ibid., and there are other\naspects of Georgia\u2019s discretionary scheme that could ex\nplain the apparent discrepancy, id., at 311\u2013313. The\nstudy did not \u201cdemonstrate a constitutionally significant\nrisk of racial bias affecting the Georgia capital sentencing\nprocess.\u201d Id., at 313.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSTEVENS suggests is somehow required by the Constitution. See\nMcCleskey v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1323263\"><a href=\"/opinion/1323263/mcclesky-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116\u2013117, 263 S. E. 2d 146, 152 (1980).\nThe only difference between the string citation here and the string\ncitation approved by this Court in McCleskey is that the citation here\nreflects an examination of at least 50% more cases.\n6                        WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\n   The McCleskey Court also considered the universe of\ncases included in the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s propor\ntionality analysis and held that \u201cabsent a showing that the\nGeorgia capital punishment system operates in an arbi\ntrary and capricious manner, [a defendant] cannot prove a\nconstitutional violation by demonstrating that other de\nfendants who may be similarly situated did not receive the\ndeath penalty.\u201d Id., at 306\u2013307 (emphasis in original).\nThe Court in Gregg also considered the issue and held that\nGeorgia\u2019s scheme would not be ineffective even if, in prac\ntice, the Georgia Supreme Court did not consider \u201cnonap\npealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed\nand cases involving homicides where a capital conviction\nis not obtained.\u201d 428 U. S., at 204, n. 56 (joint opinion of\nStewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).2 As a result, to the\nextent that JUSTICE STEVENS suggests that the Court\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In Gregg, 428 U. S., at 204, n. 56, the Court noted that the Georgia\n\nSupreme Court \u201chas the authority to consider such cases\u201d involving\n\u201cnonappealed capital convictions where a life sentence is imposed and\ncases involving homicides where a capital conviction is not obtained\u201d\nand that it \u201cdoes consider appealed murder cases where a life sentence\nhas been imposed.\u201d Petitioner contends, and JUSTICE STEVENS accepts,\nthat the Georgia Supreme Court no longer considers murder cases\nwhere a life sentence has been imposed based on a law review note that\nstudied the proportionality review conducted in 55 capital cases re\nviewed by the Georgia Supreme Court between 1994 and 2004. Ante, at\n7; Pet. for Cert. 23 (citing Note, Reviewing the Georgia Supreme\nCourt\u2019s Efforts at Proportionality Review, 39 Ga. L. Rev. 631 (2005)).\nBut petitioner and JUSTICE STEVENS do not point to any statement from\nthe Georgia Supreme Court that such cases are no longer considered\nand there is no reason to believe that the court has changed its practice\nsimply because its decisions do not explicitly cite to cases involving life\nsentences. See Pulley v. Harris, 465 U. S., 37, 48, n. 8 (1984) (\u201c[T]he\nfact that . . . [a] court was not explicit about comparative review does\nnot mean none was undertaken\u201d). Moreover, in this case, the Georgia\nSupreme Court considered a life sentence in its proportionality review\nas it explicitly evaluated whether the sentence given Griffin for the\nsame murder made petitioner\u2019s death sentence disproportionate.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nprecedent requires consideration of cases where the death\npenalty was not imposed, he is simply wrong.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 disagreement with this Court\u2019s death\npenalty precedents formed the basis for his dissent from\nthe Court\u2019s decision in McCleskey and his concurrence in\nPulley, and he stands by those decisions in his statement\ntoday. But McCleskey, Pulley, Zant, and Gregg remain the\nlaw. Because the Georgia Supreme Court applied them\nfaithfully and without any error, I concur in the denial of\ncertiorari.\n</pre>",
