Decided October 20, 2008 \n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of\nthe petition for writ of certiorari.\n  The question presented by the petition for certiorari is\nwhether Georgia’s current administration of its death\npenalty violates the Eighth Amendment’s guarantee\nagainst arbitrariness and discrimination in capital sen\ntencing. Specifically, petitioner charges that the Georgia\nSupreme Court has “fail[ed] to: (1) conduct meaningful\nproportionality review, and (2) enforce reporting require\nments under Georgia’s capital sentencing scheme,” as is\nrequired to ensure that only the most culpable offenders\nare put to death. Pet. for Cert. i. In its response to the\npetition, the State persuasively argues that petitioner did\nnot raise and litigate these claims in state court. That\nargument provides a legitimate basis for this Court’s\ndecision to deny review. I write separately to emphasize\nthat the Court’s denial has no precedential effect, see\nTeague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 296 (1989), and to note that\npetitioner’s submission is supported by our prior opinions\nevaluating the constitutionality of the Georgia statute.\n  Justice Stewart was the principal architect of our death\npenalty jurisprudence during his tenure on the Court. In\nhis separate opinion in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238\n(1972) (per curiam), he observed that death sentences\nimposed pursuant to Georgia’s capital sentencing scheme\nwere “cruel and unusual in the same way that being\nstruck by lightning is cruel and unusual.” Id., at 309\n2                  WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n(concurring opinion). The Georgia statute in effect at that\ntime placed unfettered discretion in the hands of juries,\nresulting in the arbitrary, and often discriminatory, issu\nance of capital sentences. Justice Stewart concluded that\nthe Eighth Amendment cannot tolerate the infliction of a\ndeath sentence under a legal system that permits this\nunique penalty to be wantonly and freakishly imposed.\nId., at 310.\n   The Georgia Legislature amended its capital sentencing\nscheme after Furman, and a challenge to the new scheme\nreached this Court in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153\n(1976). Our decision in that case to uphold the later en\nacted statute was founded on an understanding that the\nnew procedures the statute prescribed would protect\nagainst the imposition of death sentences influenced by\nimpermissible factors such as race. Among the new proce\ndures was a requirement that the Georgia Supreme Court\n“compar[e] each death sentence with the sentences im\nposed on similarly situated defendants to ensure that the\nsentence of death in a particular case is not disproportion\nate.” Id., at 198 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and\nSTEVENS, JJ.). We assumed that the court would consider\nwhether there were “similarly situated defendants” who\nhad not been put to death because that inquiry is an es\nsential part of any meaningful proportionality review.\n   That assumption was confirmed a few years later in\nZant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983). The question in\nthat case was whether a death sentence was valid not\nwithstanding the jury’s reliance on an invalid aggravating\ncircumstance. As in Gregg, our decision to uphold the\nsentence “depend[ed] in part on the existence of an impor\ntant procedural safeguard, the mandatory appellate re\nview of each death sentence by the Georgia Supreme\nCourt to avoid arbitrariness and to assure proportional\nity.” 462 U. S., at 890. In response to our certified ques\ntion regarding the operation of the State’s capital sentenc\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

S. 279 (1987), make it abundantly clear that\nthere is a special risk of arbitrariness in cases that involve\nblack defendants and white victims. See also Turner v.\nMurray, 476 U. S. 28, 33–37 (1986) (plurality and majority\nopinions) (discussing the heightened risks of prejudice\nthat inhere in the prosecution of interracial capital of\nfenses). Although there is some indication that those risks\nhave diminished over time, at least the race-of-victim\neffect persists. See Baldus & Woodworth, Race Discrimi\nnation and the Legitimacy of Capital Punishment: Reflec\ntions on the Interaction of Fact and Perception, 53 DePaul\nL. Rev. 1411, 1424–1426 (2004).\n   It is against that backdrop that I find this case, which\ninvolves a black defendant and a white victim, particularly\n——————\n   1 The salient aspects of Georgia’s capital sentencing scheme have\n\nchanged little since we evaluated them in Gregg and Zant. By statute,\nthe State must prove at least one of an enumerated list of aggravating\ncircumstances for an offense to be death eligible. Ga. Code Ann. §17–\n10–30(b) (2008). The jury then has complete discretion to weigh all\naggravating and mitigating factors in determining the sentence.\nGeorgia law requires the State Supreme Court to review each death\nsentence to determine whether it “was imposed under the influence of\npassion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor” and whether it “is\nexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.”\n§17–10–35(c). The trial court must in each case transmit the entire\nrecord and transcript, along with a special report prepared by the trial\njudge, to facilitate appellate review. §17–10–35(a).\n4                    WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                    Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\ntroubling. The State’s evidence showed that, on the night\nof the murder, petitioner and an accomplice drove to the\nvictim’s home. After petitioner drew the victim outside,\nthe two engaged in a struggle and petitioner stabbed the\nvictim 12 times. While his accomplice collected the vic\ntim’s wallet, petitioner used the victim’s keys to try to gain\naccess to his house, stating that he “had ‘one more to kill.’ ”\nWhen a woman inside the house yelled that she had a gun,\npetitioner and his accomplice fled. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775, 653\nS. E. 2d 439, 443 (2007). The jury found petitioner guilty\nof murder, felony murder, armed robbery, aggravated\nassault, attempted burglary, and possession of a firearm\nduring the commission of a crime. After the penalty phase\nproceeding, the jury concluded that the State had proved\nfive statutory aggravating factors (two of which the Geor\ngia Supreme Court later found invalid, id., at 781, 653\nS. E. 2d, at 447), and it sentenced petitioner to death.\n   Rather than perform a thorough proportionality review\nto mitigate the heightened risks of arbitrariness and\ndiscrimination in this case, the Georgia Supreme Court\ncarried out an utterly perfunctory review. Its undertaking\nconsisted of a single paragraph, only the final sentence of\nwhich considered whether imposition of the death penalty\nin this case was proportionate as compared to the sen\ntences imposed for similar offenses. And even then the\ncourt stated its review in the most conclusory terms: “The\ncases cited in the Appendix support our conclusion that\n[petitioner’s] punishment is not disproportionate in that\neach involved a deliberate plan to kill and killing for the\npurpose of receiving something of monetary value.” Id., at\n782, 653 S. E. 2d, at 447–448. The appendix consists of a\nstring citation of 21 cases in which the jury imposed a\ndeath sentence; it makes no reference to the facts of those\ncases or to the aggravating circumstances found by the\njury.\n   Had the Georgia Supreme Court looked outside the\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Cases in both of these categories are eminently\nrelevant to the question whether a death sentence in a\ngiven case is proportionate to the offense.2 The Georgia\nSupreme Court’s failure to acknowledge these or any other\ncases outside the limited universe of cases in which the\ndefendant was sentenced to death creates an unacceptable\nrisk that it will overlook a sentence infected by impermis\nsible considerations.3\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE  THOMAS states that the Georgia Supreme Court in fact “con\nsidered a life sentence in its proportionality review” by examining the\nsentence of petitioner’s accomplice. Post, at 6, n. 2. As the concurring\nopinion elsewhere notes, however, the accomplice “was ineligible for the\ndeath penalty because he was adjudged mentally retarded.” Post, at 3.\nBecause petitioner’s accomplice is not a “similarly situated defendant,”\nhis life sentence does not provide a meaningful point of comparison.\n   3 Moreover, even the conclusory review that the Georgia Supreme\n\nCourt actually undertook was erroneous because it failed to use rea\nsonable comparators. Had the court attended to the facts of the cases\ncited in the appendix, it would have noted that in almost 30 percent of\n6                       WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                        Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Particularly troubling is that the shortcomings of the\nGeorgia Supreme Court’s review are not unique to this\ncase. In the years immediately following Gregg, it was\nthat court’s regular practice to include in its review cases\nthat did not result in a death sentence. That practice\nbegan to change around the time this Court decided Pulley\nv. Harris, 465 U. S. 37 (1984). We stated in that case that\nthe Eighth Amendment does not require comparative\nproportionality review of every capital sentence. Id., at\n44–46; see also McCleskey, 481 U. S., at 306 (“[W]here the\nstatutory procedures adequately channel the sentencer’s\ndiscretion, such proportionality review is not constitution\nally required”). But that assertion was intended to convey\nour recognition of differences among the States’ capital\nschemes and the fact that we consider statutes as we find\nthem, id., at 45; it was not meant to undermine our con\nclusion in Gregg and Zant that such review is an impor\ntant component of the Georgia scheme.4\n——————\nthem the defendant was convicted of two homicides, in contrast to the\nsingle homicide for which petitioner was convicted.

The court’s reliance on such dissimilar\ncomparators further undermines the risk-reducing function served by\nits review.\n   4 JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that the Court in McCleskey “endorsed”\n\nprecisely the same proportionality review undertaken by the Georgia\nSupreme Court in this case. Post, at 1. Notably, McCleskey did not\nchallenge the scope of the state court’s proportionality review. See\nBrief for Respondent in McCleskey v. Kemp, O. T. 1986, No. 84–6811,\np. 29. It is thus unsurprising that this Court’s brief discussion of the\nstate court’s review did not recognize or revisit our observation in Zant\nv. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983), regarding the usual content of that\nreview; indeed, that portion of the Court’s discussion does not acknowl\nedge Zant at all. See 481 U. S., at 306. I hesitate to read into\nMcCleskey this Court’s endorsement of the Georgia Supreme Court’s\nabridged proportionality review when that issue was neither briefed by\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)       7\n\n                       Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Since Pulley, the Georgia Supreme Court has signifi\ncantly narrowed the universe of cases from which it culls\ncomparators. It now appears to be the court’s practice\nnever to consider cases in which the jury sentenced the\ndefendant to life imprisonment. See Note, 39 Ga. L. Rev.\n631, 657 (2005) (determining that in each of 55 capital\ncases reviewed by the Georgia Supreme Court between\n1994 and 2004, the court exclusively considered other\ncases resulting in a death sentence). This is not the re\nview that the Georgia Supreme Court represented to us in\nZant. And the likely result of such a truncated review—\nparticularly in conjunction with the remainder of the\nGeorgia scheme, which does not cabin the jury’s discretion\nin weighing aggravating and mitigating factors—is the\narbitrary or discriminatory imposition of death sentences\nin contravention of the Eighth Amendment.\n   Petitioner also notes a second failure of the Georgia\nSupreme Court’s review in this case. In all capital cases,\nGeorgia law requires the trial court to transmit, along\nwith the entire record and transcript, a detailed report\nprepared by the trial judge describing the defendant’s\nhistory and the circumstances of the case. Ga. Code Ann.\n§17–10–35(a). Although it has previously admonished\ntrial courts of the necessity of complying with this rule,\nsee McDaniel v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1281458\"><a href=\"/opinion/1281458/mcdaniel-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 553, 522 S.

S. 279 (1987), make it abundantly clear that\nthere is a special risk of arbitrariness in cases that involve\nblack defendants and white victims. See also Turner v.\nMurray, 476 U. S. 28, 33–37 (1986) (plurality and majority\nopinions) (discussing the heightened risks of prejudice\nthat inhere in the prosecution of interracial capital of\nfenses). Although there is some indication that those risks\nhave diminished over time, at least the race-of-victim\neffect persists. See Baldus & Woodworth, Race Discrimi\nnation and the Legitimacy of Capital Punishment: Reflec\ntions on the Interaction of Fact and Perception, 53 DePaul\nL. Rev. 1411, 1424–1426 (2004).\n   It is against that backdrop that I find this case, which\ninvolves a black defendant and a white victim, particularly\n——————\n   1 The salient aspects of Georgia’s capital sentencing scheme have\n\nchanged little since we evaluated them in Gregg and Zant. By statute,\nthe State must prove at least one of an enumerated list of aggravating\ncircumstances for an offense to be death eligible. Ga. Code Ann. §17–\n10–30(b) (2008). The jury then has complete discretion to weigh all\naggravating and mitigating factors in determining the sentence.\nGeorgia law requires the State Supreme Court to review each death\nsentence to determine whether it “was imposed under the influence of\npassion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor” and whether it “is\nexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.”\n§17–10–35(c). The trial court must in each case transmit the entire\nrecord and transcript, along with a special report prepared by the trial\njudge, to facilitate appellate review. §17–10–35(a).\n4                    WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                    Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\ntroubling. The State’s evidence showed that, on the night\nof the murder, petitioner and an accomplice drove to the\nvictim’s home. After petitioner drew the victim outside,\nthe two engaged in a struggle and petitioner stabbed the\nvictim 12 times. While his accomplice collected the vic\ntim’s wallet, petitioner used the victim’s keys to try to gain\naccess to his house, stating that he “had ‘one more to kill.’ ”\nWhen a woman inside the house yelled that she had a gun,\npetitioner and his accomplice fled. 282 Ga. 774, 775, 653\nS. E. 2d 439, 443 (2007). The jury found petitioner guilty\nof murder, felony murder, armed robbery, aggravated\nassault, attempted burglary, and possession of a firearm\nduring the commission of a crime. After the penalty phase\nproceeding, the jury concluded that the State had proved\nfive statutory aggravating factors (two of which the Geor\ngia Supreme Court later found invalid, id., at 781, 653\nS. E. 2d, at 447), and it sentenced petitioner to death.\n   Rather than perform a thorough proportionality review\nto mitigate the heightened risks of arbitrariness and\ndiscrimination in this case, the Georgia Supreme Court\ncarried out an utterly perfunctory review. Its undertaking\nconsisted of a single paragraph, only the final sentence of\nwhich considered whether imposition of the death penalty\nin this case was proportionate as compared to the sen\ntences imposed for similar offenses. And even then the\ncourt stated its review in the most conclusory terms: “The\ncases cited in the Appendix support our conclusion that\n[petitioner’s] punishment is not disproportionate in that\neach involved a deliberate plan to kill and killing for the\npurpose of receiving something of monetary value.” Id., at\n782, 653 S. E. 2d, at 447–448. The appendix consists of a\nstring citation of 21 cases in which the jury imposed a\ndeath sentence; it makes no reference to the facts of those\ncases or to the aggravating circumstances found by the\njury.\n   Had the Georgia Supreme Court looked outside the\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

See, e.g., Jones\nv. State, 279 Ga. 854, 622 S. E. 2d 1 (2005); Spickler v.\nState, 276 Ga. 164, 575 S. E. 2d 482 (2003); Cross v. State,\n271 Ga. 427, 520 S. E. 2d 457 (1999); Jenkins v. State, 268\nGa. 468, 491 S. E. 2d 54 (1997); LeMay v. State, 265 Ga.\n73, 453 S. E. 2d 737 (1995) (the circumstances of the of\nfense are described in LeMay v. State, 264 Ga. 263, 443\nS. E. 2d 274 (1994)); Cobb v. State, 250 Ga. 1, 295 S. E. 2d\n319 (1982). If the Georgia Supreme Court had expanded\nits inquiry still further, it would have discovered many\nsimilar cases in which the State did not even seek death.\nSee, e.g., Davis v. State, 281 Ga. 871, 644 S. E. 2d 113\n(2007); Wiggins v. State, 280 Ga. 627, 632 S. E. 2d 80\n(2006); Escobar v. State, 279 Ga. 727, 620 S. E. 2d 812\n(2005); Stanley v. State, 261 Ga. 412, 405 S. E. 2d 493\n(1991). Cases in both of these categories are eminently\nrelevant to the question whether a death sentence in a\ngiven case is proportionate to the offense.2 The Georgia\nSupreme Court’s failure to acknowledge these or any other\ncases outside the limited universe of cases in which the\ndefendant was sentenced to death creates an unacceptable\nrisk that it will overlook a sentence infected by impermis\nsible considerations.3\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE  THOMAS states that the Georgia Supreme Court in fact “con\nsidered a life sentence in its proportionality review” by examining the\nsentence of petitioner’s accomplice. Post, at 6, n. 2. As the concurring\nopinion elsewhere notes, however, the accomplice “was ineligible for the\ndeath penalty because he was adjudged mentally retarded.” Post, at 3.\nBecause petitioner’s accomplice is not a “similarly situated defendant,”\nhis life sentence does not provide a meaningful point of comparison.\n   3 Moreover, even the conclusory review that the Georgia Supreme\n\nCourt actually undertook was erroneous because it failed to use rea\nsonable comparators. Had the court attended to the facts of the cases\ncited in the appendix, it would have noted that in almost 30 percent of\n6                       WALKER v. GEORGIA\n\n                        Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Particularly troubling is that the shortcomings of the\nGeorgia Supreme Court’s review are not unique to this\ncase. In the years immediately following Gregg, it was\nthat court’s regular practice to include in its review cases\nthat did not result in a death sentence. That practice\nbegan to change around the time this Court decided Pulley\nv. Harris, 465 U. S. 37 (1984). We stated in that case that\nthe Eighth Amendment does not require comparative\nproportionality review of every capital sentence. Id., at\n44–46; see also McCleskey, 481 U. S., at 306 (“[W]here the\nstatutory procedures adequately channel the sentencer’s\ndiscretion, such proportionality review is not constitution\nally required”). But that assertion was intended to convey\nour recognition of differences among the States’ capital\nschemes and the fact that we consider statutes as we find\nthem, id., at 45; it was not meant to undermine our con\nclusion in Gregg and Zant that such review is an impor\ntant component of the Georgia scheme.4\n——————\nthem the defendant was convicted of two homicides, in contrast to the\nsingle homicide for which petitioner was convicted. See Franks v.\nState, 278 Ga. 246, 599 S. E. 2d 134 (2004); Sealey v. State, 277 Ga. 617,\n593 S. E. 2d 335 (2004); Arevalo v. State, 275 Ga. 392, 567 S. E. 2d 303\n(2002); Raheem v. State, 275 Ga. 87, 560 S. E. 2d 680 (2002); DeYoung\nv. State, 268 Ga. 780, 493 S. E. 2d 157 (1997); Ferrell v. State, 261 Ga.\n115, 401 S. E. 2d 741 (1991). The court’s reliance on such dissimilar\ncomparators further undermines the risk-reducing function served by\nits review.\n   4 JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that the Court in McCleskey “endorsed”\n\nprecisely the same proportionality review undertaken by the Georgia\nSupreme Court in this case. Post, at 1. Notably, McCleskey did not\nchallenge the scope of the state court’s proportionality review. See\nBrief for Respondent in McCleskey v. Kemp, O. T. 1986, No. 84–6811,\np. 29. It is thus unsurprising that this Court’s brief discussion of the\nstate court’s review did not recognize or revisit our observation in Zant\nv. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983), regarding the usual content of that\nreview; indeed, that portion of the Court’s discussion does not acknowl\nedge Zant at all. See 481 U. S., at 306. I hesitate to read into\nMcCleskey this Court’s endorsement of the Georgia Supreme Court’s\nabridged proportionality review when that issue was neither briefed by\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)       7\n\n                       Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\n   Since Pulley, the Georgia Supreme Court has signifi\ncantly narrowed the universe of cases from which it culls\ncomparators. It now appears to be the court’s practice\nnever to consider cases in which the jury sentenced the\ndefendant to life imprisonment. See Note, 39 Ga. L. Rev.\n631, 657 (2005) (determining that in each of 55 capital\ncases reviewed by the Georgia Supreme Court between\n1994 and 2004, the court exclusively considered other\ncases resulting in a death sentence). This is not the re\nview that the Georgia Supreme Court represented to us in\nZant. And the likely result of such a truncated review—\nparticularly in conjunction with the remainder of the\nGeorgia scheme, which does not cabin the jury’s discretion\nin weighing aggravating and mitigating factors—is the\narbitrary or discriminatory imposition of death sentences\nin contravention of the Eighth Amendment.\n   Petitioner also notes a second failure of the Georgia\nSupreme Court’s review in this case. In all capital cases,\nGeorgia law requires the trial court to transmit, along\nwith the entire record and transcript, a detailed report\nprepared by the trial judge describing the defendant’s\nhistory and the circumstances of the case. Ga. Code Ann.\n§17–10–35(a). Although it has previously admonished\ntrial courts of the necessity of complying with this rule,\nsee McDaniel v. State, 271 Ga. 552, 553, 522 S. E. 2d 648,\n650 (1999), the Georgia Supreme Court in this case ne\nglected to enforce it. This breakdown in the statutory\nprocess is especially troubling when viewed in light of the\nother shortcomings of that court’s review. “When a defen\ndant’s life is at stake, th[is] Court has been particularly\nsensitive to insure that every safeguard is observed.”\nGregg, 428 U. S., at 187 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,\nand STEVENS, JJ.). The Georgia Supreme Court owes its\ncapital litigants the same duty of care and must take\n—————— \n\nthe parties nor thoroughly considered by the Court. \n\n8                   WALKER v.
