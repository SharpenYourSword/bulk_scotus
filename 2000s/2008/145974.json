NATHAN DUNLAP\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n      COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA, EASTERN DISTRICT\n\n             No. 07\u20131486. Decided October 14, 2008\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY\njoins, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   North Philly, May 4, 2001. Officer Sean Devlin, Narcot\u00ad\nics Strike Force, was working the morning shift. Under\u00ad\ncover surveillance. The neighborhood? Tough as a three\u00ad\ndollar steak. Devlin knew. Five years on the beat, nine\nmonths with the Strike Force. He\u2019d made fifteen, twenty\ndrug busts in the neighborhood.\n   Devlin spotted him: a lone man on the corner. Another\napproached. Quick exchange of words. Cash handed over;\nsmall objects handed back. Each man then quickly on his\nown way. Devlin knew the guy wasn\u2019t buying bus tokens.\nHe radioed a description and Officer Stein picked up the\nbuyer. Sure enough: three bags of crack in the guy\u2019s\npocket. Head downtown and book him. Just another day\nat the office.\n                        *    *     *\n  That was not good enough for the Pennsylvania Su\u00ad\npreme Court, which held in a divided decision that the\npolice lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant. The\nCourt concluded that a \u201csingle, isolated transaction\u201d in a\nhigh-crime area was insufficient to justify the arrest, given\nthat the officer did not actually see the drugs, there was\nno tip from an informant, and the defendant did not at\u00ad\ntempt to flee. 941 A. 2d 671, 679 (2007). I disagree with\nthat conclusion, and dissent from the denial of certiorari.\nA drug purchase was not the only possible explanation for\nthe defendant\u2019s conduct, but it was certainly likely enough\n2                PENNSYLVANIA v. DUNLAP\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nto give rise to probable cause.\n   The probable-cause standard is a \u201cnontechnical concep\u00ad\ntion that deals with the factual and practical considera\u00ad\ntions of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent\nmen, not legal technicians, act.\u201d Maryland v. Pringle, 540\nU. S. 366, 370 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWhat is required is simply \u201ca reasonable ground for belief\nof guilt,\u201d id., at 371 (same)\u2014a \u201cprobability, and not a\nprima facie showing, of criminal activity,\u201d Illinois v. Gates,\n462 U. S. 213, 235 (1983) (same). \u201c[A] police officer may\ndraw inferences based on his own experience in deciding\nwhether probable cause exists,\u201d Ornelas v. United States,\n517 U. S. 690, 700 (1996), including inferences \u201cthat might\nwell elude an untrained person,\u201d United States v. Cortez,\n449 U. S. 411, 418 (1981).\n   On the facts of this case, I think the police clearly had\nprobable cause to arrest the defendant. An officer with\ndrug interdiction experience in the neighborhood saw two\nmen on a street corner\u2014with no apparent familiarity or\nprior interaction\u2014make a quick hand-to-hand exchange of\ncash for \u201c \u2018small objects.\u2019 \u201d 941 A. 2d, at 673. This ex\u00ad\nchange took place in a high-crime neighborhood known for\ndrug activity, far from any legitimate businesses. Perhaps\nit is possible to imagine innocent explanations for this\nconduct, but I cannot come up with any remotely as likely\nas the drug transaction Devlin believed he had witnessed.\nIn any event, an officer is not required to eliminate all\ninnocent explanations for a suspicious set of facts to have\nprobable cause to make an arrest. As we explained in\nGates, \u201c[i]n making a determination of probable cause the\nrelevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is\n\u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018guilty,\u2019 but the degree of suspicion that at\u00ad\ntaches to particular types of noncriminal acts.\u201d 462 U. S.,\nat 244, n. 13.\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court emphasized that the\npolice did not actually see any drugs. 941 A. 2d, at 679.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2008)           3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nBut Officer Devlin and his partner were conducting un\u00ad\ndercover surveillance. From a distance, it would be diffi\u00ad\ncult to have a clear view of the small objects that changed\nhands. As the Commonwealth explains in its petition for\ncertiorari, the \u201cclassic\u201d drug transaction is a hand-to-hand\nexchange, on the street, of cash for small objects. Pet. for\nCert. 5\u20138. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision\nwill make it more difficult for the police to conduct drug\ninterdiction in high-crime areas, unless they employ the\nriskier practice of having undercover officers actually\nmake a purchase or sale of drugs.\n   The Pennsylvania Court also noted that the defendant\ndid not flee. 941 A. 2d, at 671. Flight is hardly a prereq\u00ad\nuisite to a finding of probable cause. A defendant may\nwell decide that the odds of escape do not justify adding\nanother charge to that of drug possession. And of course\nthere is no suggestion in the record that the defendant had\nany chance to flee\u2014he was caught redhanded.\n   Aside from its importance for law enforcement, this\nquestion has divided state courts, a traditional ground\nwarranting review on certiorari. S. Ct. Rule 10(b). The\nNew Jersey Supreme Court has held that an \u201cexperienced\nnarcotics officer\u201d had probable cause to make an arrest\nwhen\u2014in a vacant lot in a high-drug neighborhood\u2014he\n\u201csaw defendant and his companion give money to [a] third\nperson in exchange for small unknown objects.\u201d State v.\nMoore, 181 N. J. 40, 46\u201347, 853 A. 2d 903, 907 (2004). The\nRhode Island Supreme Court reached the same conclusion\nin a case where the defendants\u2014through their car win\u00ad\ndows\u2014exchanged cash for a small \u201cbag of suspected nar\u00ad\ncotics.\u201d State v. Castro, 891 A. 2d 848, 851\u2013854 (2006). In\ncontrast, the Colorado Supreme Court held that a hand-to\u00ad\nhand exchange of unknown objects did not give the police\nprobable cause to make an arrest, even where one of the\nmen was a known drug dealer. People v. Ratcliff, 778\nP. 2d 1371, 1377\u20131378 (1989). All these cases have unique\n4                PENNSYLVANIA v. DUNLAP\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfactual wrinkles, as any probable-cause case would, but\nthe core fact pattern is the same: experienced police offi\u00ad\ncers observing hand-to-hand exchanges of cash for small,\nunknown objects in high-crime neighborhoods.\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court speculated that such\nan exchange could have been perfectly innocent. But as\nJudge Friendly has pointed out, \u201c[j]udges are not required to\nexhibit a naivet\u00e9 from which ordinary citizens are free.\u201d\nUnited States v. Stanchich, 550 F. 2d 1294, 1300 (CA2\n1977). Based not only on common sense but also his experi\u00ad\nence as a narcotics officer and his previous work in the\nneighborhood, Officer Devlin concluded that what happened\non that street corner was probably a drug transaction. That\nis by far the most reasonable conclusion, even though our\ncases only require it to be a reasonable conclusion.\n   I would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment of the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court.\n",
