UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                No. 07\u20131390. Decided October 14, 2008 \n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n  Patrick Marlowe was a prison guard whose failure to\nprovide needed medical care caused a prisoner\u2019s death. He\nwas convicted of deprivation of constitutional rights in\nviolation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7242. Under the then-applicable\nSentencing Guidelines, the recommended sentence for civil\nrights violations was calculated using the base offense\nlevel of the crime underlying the civil rights violation.\nSince Marlowe\u2019s jury had not been asked to determine his\nmental state in connection with the death, the facts re\nsolved by the jury verdict convicted him of no more than\ninvoluntary manslaughter through criminal negligence.\nThe base offense level for that crime was 10, which, under\nthe other circumstances of Marlowe\u2019s offense, would have\nproduced a recommended sentence of 51 to 63 months.\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n\u00a72A1.4 (Nov. 2002). The District Judge, however, deter\nmined that Marlowe had possessed the \u201cmalice afore\nthought\u201d required for second-degree murder, which in\ncreased the base offense level from 10 to 33, producing a\nGuidelines-recommended sentence of life. The District\nJudge sentenced Marlowe to life in prison.\n  On appeal, the Sixth Circuit applied a presumption of\nreasonableness to the sentence1 because, in light of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For the reasons set forth in my separate opinion in Rita v. United\n\nStates, 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007), I believe that it is improper for courts\nto review for substantive reasonableness sentences that are within the\n2                 MARLOWE v.

United States v. Conatser,\n514 F. 3d 508, 526\u2013527 (2008).2 In other words, the Sixth\nCircuit found the life sentence lawful solely because of the\njudge-found fact that Marlowe had acted with malice\naforethought. This falls short of what we have held the\nright to trial by jury demands: \u201cAny fact (other than a\nprior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence\nexceeding the maximum authorized by the facts estab\nlished by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admit\nted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reason\nable doubt.\u201d United States v.

I give stare decisis effect, however, to the Court\u2019s\ncontrary holding in that case.\n  2 Only one of the three-judge panel said that she would have upheld\n\nthe sentence as reasonable even if it had been calculated as an upward\ndeparture from the Guidelines-recommended sentence. 514 F. 3d, at\n528\u2013532 (Moore, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
