Argued April 22, 2009\u2014Decided June 29, 2009*\nNew Haven, Conn. (City), uses objective examinations to identify those\n firefighters best qualified for promotion. When the results of such an\n exam to fill vacant lieutenant and captain positions showed that\n white candidates had outperformed minority candidates, a rancorous\n public debate ensued. Confronted with arguments both for and\n against certifying the test results\u2014and threats of a lawsuit either\n way\u2014the City threw out the results based on the statistical racial\n disparity. Petitioners, white and Hispanic firefighters who passed\n the exams but were denied a chance at promotions by the City\u2019s re\n fusal to certify the test results, sued the City and respondent officials,\n alleging that discarding the test results discriminated against them\n based on their race in violation of, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil\n Rights Act of 1964. The defendants responded that had they certified\n the test results, they could have faced Title VII liability for adopting\n a practice having a disparate impact on minority firefighters. The\n District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and\n the Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The City\u2019s action in discarding the tests violated Title VII.\n  Pp. 16\u201334.\n     (a) Title VII prohibits intentional acts of employment discrimina\n  tion based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1) (disparate treatment), as well as policies or practices\n  that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a dispropor\n  tionately adverse effect on minorities, \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(i) (disparate\n  impact). Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of dispa\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 08\u2013328, Ricci et al. v. DeStefano et al., also on\ncertiorari to the same court.\n2                         RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    rate impact, the employer may defend by demonstrating that its\n    policy or practice is \u201cjob related for the position in question and con\n    sistent with business necessity.\u201d Ibid. If the employer meets that\n    burden, the plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer\n    refuses to adopt an available alternative practice that has less dispa\n    rate impact and serves the employer\u2019s legitimate needs. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u2013\n    2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C). Pp. 17\u201319.\n       (b) Under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional\n    discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an\n    unintentional, disparate impact, the employer must have a strong\n    basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact li\n    ability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.\n    The Court\u2019s analysis begins with the premise that the City\u2019s actions\n    would violate Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment prohibition absent some\n    valid defense. All the evidence demonstrates that the City rejected\n    the test results because the higher scoring candidates were white.\n    Without some other justification, this express, race-based decision\n    making is prohibited. The question, therefore, is whether the pur\n    pose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\n    be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. The Court has\n    considered cases similar to the present litigation, but in the context\n    of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Such cases\n    can provide helpful guidance in this statutory context. See Watson v.\n    Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 993. In those cases, the\n    Court held that certain government actions to remedy past racial dis\n    crimination\u2014actions that are themselves based on race\u2014are consti\n    tutional only where there is a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d that the re\n    medial actions were necessary. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488\n    U. S. 469, 500; see also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267,\n    277. In announcing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the Wy\n    gant plurality recognized the tension between eliminating segrega\n    tion and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all gov\n    ernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other. 476\n    U. S., at 277. It reasoned that \u201c[e]videntiary support for the conclu\n    sion that remedial action is warranted becomes crucial when the re\n    medial program is challenged in court by nonminority employees.\u201d\n    Ibid. The same interests are at work in the interplay between Title\n    VII\u2019s disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions. Apply\n    ing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to\n    both provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance\n    with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances. It also allows\n    the disparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is consis\n    tent with other Title VII provisions, including the prohibition on ad\n    justing employment-related test scores based on race, see \u00a72000e\u2013\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n2(l), and the section that expressly protects bona fide promotional ex\nams, see \u00a72000e\u20132(h). Thus, the Court adopts the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard as a matter of statutory construction in order to\nresolve any conflict between Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment and dis\nparate-impact provisions. Pp. 19\u201326.\n   (c) The City\u2019s race-based rejection of the test results cannot satisfy\nthe strong-basis-in-evidence standard. Pp. 26\u201334.\n      (i) The racial adverse impact in this litigation was significant,\nand petitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a prima\nfacie case of disparate-impact liability. The problem for respondents\nis that such a prima facie case\u2014essentially, a threshold showing of a\nsignificant statistical disparity, Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440,\n446, and nothing more\u2014is far from a strong basis in evidence that\nthe City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the\ntest results. That is because the City could be liable for disparate\nimpact discrimination only if the exams at issue were not job related\nand consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally\nvalid, less discriminatory alternative that served the City\u2019s needs but\nthat the City refused to adopt. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A), (C). Based on the\nrecord the parties developed through discovery, there is no substan\ntial basis in evidence that the test was deficient in either respect.\nPp. 26\u201328.\n      (ii) The City\u2019s assertions that the exams at issue were not job re\nlated and consistent with business necessity are blatantly contra\ndicted by the record, which demonstrates the detailed steps taken to\ndevelop and administer the tests and the painstaking analyses of the\nquestions asked to assure their relevance to the captain and lieuten\nant positions. The testimony also shows that complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not specifically ap\nply to firefighting practices in the City were fully addressed, and that\nthe City turned a blind eye to evidence supporting the exams\u2019 valid\nity. Pp. 28\u201329.\n      (iii) Respondents also lack a strong basis in evidence showing an\nequally valid, less discriminatory testing alternative that the City, by\ncertifying the test results, would necessarily have refused to adopt.\nRespondents\u2019 three arguments to the contrary all fail. First, respon\ndents refer to testimony that a different composite-score calculation\nwould have allowed the City to consider black candidates for then\nopen positions, but they have produced no evidence to show that the\ncandidate weighting actually used was indeed arbitrary, or that the\ndifferent weighting would be an equally valid way to determine\nwhether candidates are qualified for promotions. Second, respon\ndents argue that the City could have adopted a different interpreta\ntion of its charter provision limiting promotions to the highest scoring\n4                         RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    applicants, and that the interpretation would have produced less dis\n    criminatory results; but respondents\u2019 approach would have violated\n    Title VII\u2019s prohibition of race-based adjustment of test results,\n    \u00a72000e\u20132(l). Third, testimony asserting that the use of an assess\n    ment center to evaluate candidates\u2019 behavior in typical job tasks\n    would have had less adverse impact than written exams does not aid\n    respondents, as it is contradicted by other statements in the record\n    indicating that the City could not have used assessment centers for\n    the exams at issue. Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis\n    in-evidence standard applies to this case, respondents cannot create a\n    genuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradictory) state\n    ments in the record. Pp. 29\u201333.\n         (iv) Fear of litigation alone cannot justify the City\u2019s reliance on\n    race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and\n    qualified for promotions. Discarding the test results was impermis\n    sible under Title VII, and summary judgment is appropriate for peti\n    tioners on their disparate-treatment claim. If, after it certifies the\n    test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of\n    today\u2019s holding the City can avoid disparate-impact liability based on\n    the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, it\n    would have been subject to disparate-treatment liability.

An agency\u2019s officers command respect within the\ndepartment and in the whole community; and, of course,\nadded responsibilities command increased salary and\nbenefits. Aware of the intense competition for promotions,\nNew Haven, like many cities, relies on objective examina\ntions to identify the best qualified candidates.\n   In 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took examinations\nto qualify for promotion to the rank of lieutenant or cap\ntain. Promotion examinations in New Haven (or City)\nwere infrequent, so the stakes were high. The results\nwould determine which firefighters would be considered\nfor promotions during the next two years, and the order in\nwhich they would be considered. Many firefighters stud\n2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nied for months, at considerable personal and financial cost.\n  When the examination results showed that white candi\ndates had outperformed minority candidates, the mayor\nand other local politicians opened a public debate that\nturned rancorous. Some firefighters argued the tests\nshould be discarded because the results showed the tests\nto be discriminatory. They threatened a discrimination\nlawsuit if the City made promotions based on the tests.\nOther firefighters said the exams were neutral and fair.\nAnd they, in turn, threatened a discrimination lawsuit if\nthe City, relying on the statistical racial disparity, ignored\nthe test results and denied promotions to the candidates\nwho had performed well. In the end the City took the side\nof those who protested the test results. It threw out the\nexaminations.\n  Certain white and Hispanic firefighters who likely\nwould have been promoted based on their good test per\nformance sued the City and some of its officials. Theirs is\nthe suit now before us. The suit alleges that, by discard\ning the test results, the City and the named officials dis\ncriminated against the plaintiffs based on their race, in\nviolation of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., and\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend\nment. The City and the officials defended their actions,\narguing that if they had certified the results, they could\nhave faced liability under Title VII for adopting a practice\nthat had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendants, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n  We conclude that race-based action like the City\u2019s in this\ncase is impermissible under Title VII unless the employer\ncan demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that, had it not\ntaken the action, it would have been liable under the\ndisparate-impact statute. The respondents, we further\ndetermine, cannot meet that threshold standard. As a\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult, the City\u2019s action in discarding the tests was a\nviolation of Title VII. In light of our ruling under the\nstatutes, we need not reach the question whether respon\ndents\u2019 actions may have violated the Equal Protection\nClause.\n                             I\n   This litigation comes to us after the parties\u2019 cross\nmotions for summary judgment, so we set out the facts in\nsome detail. As the District Court noted, although \u201cthe\nparties strenuously dispute the relevance and legal import\nof, and inferences to be drawn from, many aspects of this\ncase, the underlying facts are largely undisputed.\u201d 554\nF. Supp. 2d 142, 145 (Conn. 2006).\n                             A\n   When the City of New Haven undertook to fill vacant\nlieutenant and captain positions in its fire department\n(Department), the promotion and hiring process was gov\nerned by the city charter, in addition to federal and state\nlaw. The charter establishes a merit system. That system\nrequires the City to fill vacancies in the classified civil\nservice ranks with the most qualified individuals, as de\ntermined by job-related examinations. After each exami\nnation, the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) certifies\na ranked list of applicants who passed the test. Under the\ncharter\u2019s \u201crule of three,\u201d the relevant hiring authority\nmust fill each vacancy by choosing one candidate from the\ntop three scorers on the list. Certified promotional lists\nremain valid for two years.\n   The City\u2019s contract with the New Haven firefighters\u2019\nunion specifies additional requirements for the promotion\nprocess. Under the contract, applicants for lieutenant and\ncaptain positions were to be screened using written and\noral examinations, with the written exam accounting for\n60 percent and the oral exam 40 percent of an applicant\u2019s\n4                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntotal score. To sit for the examinations, candidates for\nlieutenant needed 30 months\u2019 experience in the Depart\nment, a high-school diploma, and certain vocational train\ning courses. Candidates for captain needed one year\u2019s\nservice as a lieutenant in the Department, a high-school\ndiploma, and certain vocational training courses.\n   After reviewing bids from various consultants, the City\nhired Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc. (IOS) to\ndevelop and administer the examinations, at a cost to the\nCity of $100,000. IOS is an Illinois company that special\nizes in designing entry-level and promotional examina\ntions for fire and police departments. In order to fit the\nexaminations to the New Haven Department, IOS began\nthe test-design process by performing job analyses to\nidentify the tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are\nessential for the lieutenant and captain positions. IOS\nrepresentatives interviewed incumbent captains and\nlieutenants and their supervisors. They rode with and\nobserved other on-duty officers. Using information from\nthose interviews and ride-alongs, IOS wrote job-analysis\nquestionnaires and administered them to most of the\nincumbent battalion chiefs, captains, and lieutenants in\nthe Department. At every stage of the job analyses, IOS,\nby deliberate choice, oversampled minority firefighters to\nensure that the results\u2014which IOS would use to develop\nthe examinations\u2014would not unintentionally favor white\ncandidates.\n   With the job-analysis information in hand, IOS devel\noped the written examinations to measure the candidates\u2019\njob-related knowledge. For each test, IOS compiled a list\nof training manuals, Department procedures, and other\nmaterials to use as sources for the test questions. IOS\npresented the proposed sources to the New Haven fire\nchief and assistant fire chief for their approval. Then,\nusing the approved sources, IOS drafted a multiple-choice\ntest for each position. Each test had 100 questions, as\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired by CSB rules, and was written below a 10th\ngrade reading level. After IOS prepared the tests, the City\nopened a 3-month study period. It gave candidates a list\nthat identified the source material for the questions, in\ncluding the specific chapters from which the questions\nwere taken.\n   IOS developed the oral examinations as well. These\nconcentrated on job skills and abilities. Using the job\nanalysis information, IOS wrote hypothetical situations to\ntest incident-command skills, firefighting tactics, interper\nsonal skills, leadership, and management ability, among\nother things. Candidates would be presented with these\nhypotheticals and asked to respond before a panel of three\nassessors.\n   IOS assembled a pool of 30 assessors who were superior\nin rank to the positions being tested. At the City\u2019s insis\ntence (because of controversy surrounding previous ex\naminations), all the assessors came from outside Connecti\ncut. IOS submitted the assessors\u2019 resumes to City officials\nfor approval. They were battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs,\nand chiefs from departments of similar sizes to New Ha\nven\u2019s throughout the country. Sixty-six percent of the\npanelists were minorities, and each of the nine three\nmember assessment panels contained two minority mem\nbers. IOS trained the panelists for several hours on the\nday before it administered the examinations, teaching\nthem how to score the candidates\u2019 responses consistently\nusing checklists of desired criteria.\n   Candidates took the examinations in November and\nDecember 2003. Seventy-seven candidates completed the\nlieutenant examination\u201443 whites, 19 blacks, and 15\nHispanics. Of those, 34 candidates passed\u201425 whites, 6\nblacks, and 3 Hispanics. 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 145. Eight\nlieutenant positions were vacant at the time of the exami\nnation. As the rule of three operated, this meant that the\ntop 10 candidates were eligible for an immediate promo\n6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion to lieutenant. All 10 were white. Ibid. Subsequent\nvacancies would have allowed at least 3 black candidates\nto be considered for promotion to lieutenant.\n   Forty-one candidates completed the captain examina\ntion\u201425 whites, 8 blacks, and 8 Hispanics. Of those, 22\ncandidates passed\u201416 whites, 3 blacks, and 3 Hispanics.\nIbid. Seven captain positions were vacant at the time of\nthe examination. Under the rule of three, 9 candidates\nwere eligible for an immediate promotion to captain\u20147\nwhites and 2 Hispanics. Ibid.\n                             B\n   The City\u2019s contract with IOS contemplated that, after\nthe examinations, IOS would prepare a technical report\nthat described the examination processes and methodolo\ngies and analyzed the results. But in January 2004,\nrather than requesting the technical report, City officials,\nincluding the City\u2019s counsel, Thomas Ude, convened a\nmeeting with IOS Vice President Chad Legel. (Legel was\nthe leader of the IOS team that developed and adminis\ntered the tests.) Based on the test results, the City offi\ncials expressed concern that the tests had discriminated\nagainst minority candidates. Legel defended the examina\ntions\u2019 validity, stating that any numerical disparity be\ntween white and minority candidates was likely due to\nvarious external factors and was in line with results of the\nDepartment\u2019s previous promotional examinations.\n   Several days after the meeting, Ude sent a letter to the\nCSB purporting to outline its duties with respect to the\nexamination results. Ude stated that under federal law,\n\u201ca statistical demonstration of disparate impact,\u201d standing\nalone, \u201cconstitutes a sufficiently serious claim of racial\ndiscrimination to serve as a predicate for employer\ninitiated, voluntar[y] remedies\u2014even . . . race-conscious\nremedies.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 443a;\nsee also 554 F.

Tina Burgett, director of the City\u2019s\nDepartment of Human Resources, opened the meeting by\ntelling the CSB that \u201cthere is a significant disparate im\npact on these two exams.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u2013\n1428, at 466a. She distributed lists showing the candi\ndates\u2019 races and scores (written, oral, and composite) but\nnot their names. Ude also described the test results as\nreflecting \u201ca very significant disparate impact,\u201d id., at\n477a, and he outlined possible grounds for the CSB\u2019s\nrefusing to certify the results.\n   Although they did not know whether they had passed or\nfailed, some firefighter-candidates spoke at the first CSB\nmeeting in favor of certifying the test results. Michael\nBlatchley stated that \u201c[e]very one\u201d of the questions on the\nwritten examination \u201ccame from the [study] material. . . .\n[I]f you read the materials and you studied the material,\nyou would have done well on the test.\u201d App. in No. 06\u2013\n4996\u2013cv (CA2), pp. A772\u2013A773 (hereinafter CA2 App.).\nFrank Ricci stated that the test questions were based on\nthe Department\u2019s own rules and procedures and on \u201cna\ntionally recognized\u201d materials that represented the \u201cac\ncepted standard[s]\u201d for firefighting. Id., at A785\u2013A786.\nRicci stated that he had \u201cseveral learning disabilities,\u201d\nincluding dyslexia; that he had spent more than $1,000 to\npurchase the materials and pay his neighbor to read them\non tape so he could \u201cgive it [his] best shot\u201d; and that he\nhad studied \u201c8 to 13 hours a day to prepare\u201d for the test.\nId., at A786, A789. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I made it,\u201d Ricci\ntold the CSB, \u201c[b]ut the people who passed should be\npromoted. When your life\u2019s on the line, second best may\nnot be good enough.\u201d Id., at A787\u2013A788.\n   Other firefighters spoke against certifying the test\n8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresults. They described the test questions as outdated or\nnot relevant to firefighting practices in New Haven. Gary\nTinney stated that source materials \u201ccame out of New\nYork. . . . Their makeup of their city and everything is\ntotally different than ours.\u201d Id., at A774\u2013A775; see also\nid., at A779, A780\u2013A781. And they criticized the test\nmaterials, a full set of which cost about $500, for being too\nexpensive and too long.\n                              2\n   At a second CSB meeting, on February 5, the president\nof the New Haven firefighters\u2019 union asked the CSB to\nperform a validation study to determine whether the tests\nwere job-related. Petitioners\u2019 counsel in this action argued\nthat the CSB should certify the results. A representative\nof the International Association of Black Professional\nFirefighters, Donald Day from neighboring Bridgeport,\nConnecticut, \u201cbeseech[ed]\u201d the CSB \u201cto throw away that\ntest,\u201d which he described as \u201cinherently unfair\u201d because of\nthe racial distribution of the results. Id., at A830\u2013A831.\nAnother Bridgeport-based representative of the associa\ntion, Ronald Mackey, stated that a validation study was\nnecessary. He suggested that the City could \u201cadjust\u201d the\ntest results to \u201cmeet the criteria of having a certain\namount of minorities get elevated to the rank of Lieuten\nant and Captain.\u201d Id., at A838. At the end of this meet\ning, the CSB members agreed to ask IOS to send a repre\nsentative to explain how it had developed and\nadministered the examinations.        They also discussed\nasking a panel of experts to review the examinations and\nadvise the CSB whether to certify the results.\n                             3\n  At a third meeting, on February 11, Legel addressed the\nCSB on behalf of IOS. Legel stated that IOS had previ\nously prepared entry-level firefighter examinations for the\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCity but not a promotional examination. He explained\nthat IOS had developed examinations for departments in\ncommunities with demographics similar to New Haven\u2019s,\nincluding Orange County, Florida; Lansing, Michigan; and\nSan Jose, California.\n   Legel explained the exam-development process to the\nCSB. He began by describing the job analyses IOS per\nformed of the captain and lieutenant positions\u2014the inter\nviews, ride-alongs, and questionnaires IOS designed to\n\u201cgenerate a list of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities\nthat are considered essential to performance\u201d of the jobs.\nId., at A931\u2013A932. He outlined how IOS prepared the\nwritten and oral examinations, based on the job-analysis\nresults, to test most heavily those qualities that the re\nsults indicated were \u201ccritica[l]\u201d or \u201cessentia[l].\u201d Id., at\nA931. And he noted that IOS took the material for each\ntest question directly from the approved source materials.\nLegel told the CSB that third-party reviewers had scruti\nnized the examinations to ensure that the written test was\ndrawn from the source material and that the oral test\naccurately tested real-world situations that captains and\nlieutenants would face. Legel confirmed that IOS had\nselected oral-examination panelists so that each three\nmember assessment panel included one white, one black,\nand one Hispanic member.\n   Near the end of his remarks, Legel \u201cimplor[ed] anyone\nthat had . . . concerns to review the content of the exam.\nIn my professional opinion, it\u2019s facially neutral. There\u2019s\nnothing in those examinations . . . that should cause\nsomebody to think that one group would perform differ\nently than another group.\u201d Id., at A961.\n                              4\n  At the next meeting, on March 11, the CSB heard from\nthree witnesses it had selected to \u201ctell us a little bit about\ntheir views of the testing, the process, [and] the methodol\n10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nogy.\u201d Id., at A1020. The first, Christopher Hornick, spoke\nto the CSB by telephone.           Hornick is an indus\ntrial/organizational psychologist from Texas who operates\na consulting business that \u201cdirect[ly]\u201d competes with IOS.\nId., at A1029. Hornick, who had not \u201cstud[ied] the test at\nlength or in detail\u201d and had not \u201cseen the job analysis\ndata,\u201d told the CSB that the scores indicated a \u201crelatively\nhigh adverse impact.\u201d Id., at A1028, A1030, A1043. He\nstated that \u201c[n]ormally, whites outperform ethnic minori\nties on the majority of standardized testing procedures,\u201d\nbut that he was \u201ca little surprised\u201d by the disparity in the\ncandidates\u2019 scores\u2014although \u201c[s]ome of it is fairly typical\nof what we\u2019ve seen in other areas of the countr[y] and\nother tests.\u201d Id., at A1028\u2013A1029. Hornick stated that\nthe \u201cadverse impact on the written exam was somewhat\nhigher but generally in the range that we\u2019ve seen profes\nsionally.\u201d Id., at A1030\u2013A1031.\n   When asked to explain the New Haven test results,\nHornick opined in the telephone conversation that the\ncollective-bargaining agreement\u2019s requirement of using\nwritten and oral examinations with a 60/40 composite\nscore might account for the statistical disparity. He also\nstated that \u201c[b]y not having anyone from within the\n[D]epartment review\u201d the tests before they were adminis\ntered\u2014a limitation the City had imposed to protect the\nsecurity of the exam questions\u2014\u201cyou inevitably get things\nin there\u201d that are based on the source materials but are\nnot relevant to New Haven. Id., at A1034\u2013A1035. Hor\nnick suggested that testing candidates at an \u201cassessment\ncenter\u201d rather than using written and oral examinations\n\u201cmight serve [the City\u2019s] needs better.\u201d Id., at A1039\u2013\nA1040. Hornick stated that assessment centers, where\ncandidates face real-world situations and respond just as\nthey would in the field, allow candidates \u201cto demonstrate\nhow they would address a particular problem as opposed\nto just verbally saying it or identifying the correct option\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\non a written test.\u201d Ibid.\n   Hornick made clear that he was \u201cnot suggesting that\n[IOS] somehow created a test that had adverse impacts\nthat it should not have had.\u201d Id., at A1038. He described\nthe IOS examinations as \u201creasonably good test[s].\u201d Id., at\nA1041. He stated that the CSB\u2019s best option might be to\n\u201ccertify the list as it exists\u201d and work to change the proc\ness for future tests, including by \u201c[r]ewriting the Civil\nService Rules.\u201d Ibid. Hornick concluded his telephonic\nremarks by telling the CSB that \u201cfor the future,\u201d his com\npany \u201ccertainly would like to help you if we can.\u201d Id., at\nA1046.\n   The second witness was Vincent Lewis, a fire program\nspecialist for the Department of Homeland Security and a\nretired fire captain from Michigan. Lewis, who is black,\nhad looked \u201cextensively\u201d at the lieutenant exam and \u201ca\nlittle less extensively\u201d at the captain exam. He stated that\nthe candidates \u201cshould know that material.\u201d Id., at\nA1048, A1052. In Lewis\u2019s view, the \u201cquestions were rele\nvant for both exams,\u201d and the New Haven candidates had\nan advantage because the study materials identified the\nparticular book chapters from which the questions were\ntaken. In other departments, by contrast, \u201cyou had to\nknow basically the . . . entire book.\u201d Id., at A1053. Lewis\nconcluded that any disparate impact likely was due to a\npattern that \u201cusually whites outperform some of the mi\nnorities on testing,\u201d or that \u201cmore whites . . . take the\nexam.\u201d Id., at A1054.\n   The final witness was Janet Helms, a professor at Bos\nton College whose \u201cprimary area of expertise\u201d is \u201cnot with\nfirefighters per se\u201d but in \u201crace and culture as they influ\nence performance on tests and other assessment proce\ndures.\u201d Id., at A1060. Helms expressly declined the CSB\u2019s\noffer to review the examinations. At the outset, she noted\nthat \u201cregardless of what kind of written test we give in\nthis country . . . we can just about predict how many peo\n12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nple will pass who are members of under-represented\ngroups. And your data are not that inconsistent with\nwhat predictions would say were the case.\u201d Id., at A1061.\nHelms nevertheless offered several \u201cideas about what\nmight be possible factors\u201d to explain statistical differences\nin the results. Id., at A1062. She concluded that because\n67 percent of the respondents to the job-analysis question\nnaires were white, the test questions might have favored\nwhite candidates, because \u201cmost of the literature on fire\nfighters shows that the different groups perform the job\ndifferently.\u201d Id., at A1063. Helms closed by stating that\nno matter what test the City had administered, it would\nhave revealed \u201ca disparity between blacks and whites,\nHispanics and whites,\u201d particularly on a written test. Id.,\nat A1072.\n                              5\n  At the final CSB meeting, on March 18, Ude (the City\u2019s\ncounsel) argued against certifying the examination re\nsults. Discussing the City\u2019s obligations under federal law,\nUde advised the CSB that a finding of adverse impact \u201cis\nthe beginning, not the end, of a review of testing proce\ndures\u201d to determine whether they violated the disparate\nimpact provision of Title VII. Ude focused the CSB on\ndetermining \u201cwhether there are other ways to test for . . .\nthose positions that are equally valid with less adverse\nimpact.\u201d Id., at A1101. Ude described Hornick as having\nsaid that the written examination \u201chad one of the most\nsevere adverse impacts that he had seen\u201d and that \u201cthere\nare much better alternatives to identifying [firefighting]\nskills.\u201d Ibid. Ude offered his \u201copinion that promotions . . .\nas a result of these tests would not be consistent with\nfederal law, would not be consistent with the purposes of\nour Civil Service Rules or our Charter[,] nor is it in the\nbest interests of the firefighters . . . who took the exams.\u201d\nId., at A1103\u2013A1104. He stated that previous Department\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

It\u2019s not our burden to show that\n    there\u2019s an exam out there that can be better. We\u2019ve\n    got an exam. We\u2019ve got a result. . . .\n       \u201cMR. UDE: Mr. Chair, I point out that Dr. Hornick\n    said that. He said that there are other tests out there\n    that would have less adverse impact and that [would]\n    be more valid.\n       \u201cCHAIRPERSON SEGALOFF: You think that\u2019s\n    enough for us to throw this test upside-down . . . be\n    cause Dr. Hornick said it?\n       \u201cMR. UDE: I think that by itself would be sufficient.\n    Yes. I also would point out that . . . it is the em\n    ployer\u2019s burden to justify the use of the examination.\u201d\n    Id., at A1108\u2013A1109.\n  Karen DuBois-Walton, the City\u2019s chief administrative\nofficer, spoke on behalf of Mayor John DeStefano and\nargued against certifying the results. DuBois-Walton\nstated that the results, when considered under the rule of\nthree and applied to then-existing captain and lieutenant\nvacancies, created a situation in which black and Hispanic\ncandidates were disproportionately excluded from oppor\ntunity. DuBois-Walton also relied on Hornick\u2019s testimony,\nasserting that Hornick \u201cmade it extremely clear that . . .\nthere are more appropriate ways to assess one\u2019s ability to\nserve\u201d as a captain or lieutenant. Id., at A1120.\n14                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Burgett (the human resources director) asked the CSB\nto discard the examination results. She, too, relied on\nHornick\u2019s statement to show the existence of alternative\ntesting methods, describing Hornick as having \u201cstarted to\npoint out that alternative testing does exist\u201d and as having\n\u201cbegun to suggest that there are some different ways of\ndoing written examinations.\u201d Id., at A1125, A1128.\n   Other witnesses addressed the CSB. They included the\npresident of the New Haven firefighters\u2019 union, who sup\nported certification. He reminded the CSB that Hornick\n\u201calso concluded that the tests were reasonable and fair\nand under the current structure to certify them.\u201d Id., at\nA1137. Firefighter Frank Ricci again argued for certifica\ntion; he stated that although \u201cassessment centers in some\ncases show less adverse impact,\u201d id., at A1140, they were\nnot available alternatives for the current round of promo\ntions. It would take several years, Ricci explained, for the\nDepartment to develop an assessment-center protocol and\nthe accompanying training materials. Id., at A1141.\nLieutenant Matthew Marcarelli, who had taken the cap\ntain\u2019s exam, spoke in favor of certification.\n   At the close of witness testimony, the CSB voted on a\nmotion to certify the examinations. With one member\nrecused, the CSB deadlocked 2 to 2, resulting in a decision\nnot to certify the results. Explaining his vote to certify the\nresults, Chairman Segaloff stated that \u201cnobody convinced\nme that we can feel comfortable that, in fact, there\u2019s some\nlikelihood that there\u2019s going to be an exam designed that\u2019s\ngoing to be less discriminatory.\u201d Id., at A1159\u2013A1160.\n                             C\n   The CSB\u2019s decision not to certify the examination re\nsults led to this lawsuit. The plaintiffs\u2014who are the\npetitioners here\u2014are 17 white firefighters and 1 Hispanic\nfirefighter who passed the examinations but were denied a\nchance at promotions when the CSB refused to certify the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntest results. They include the named plaintiff, Frank\nRicci, who addressed the CSB at multiple meetings.\n   Petitioners sued the City, Mayor DeStefano, DuBois-\nWalton, Ude, Burgett, and the two CSB members who\nvoted against certification. Petitioners also named as a\ndefendant Boise Kimber, a New Haven resident who\nvoiced strong opposition to certifying the results. Those\nindividuals are respondents in this Court. Petitioners\nfiled suit under Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a71979 and 1980, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71983 and 1985, alleging that respondents, by arguing or\nvoting against certifying the results, violated and con\nspired to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment. Petitioners also filed timely charges\nof discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC); upon the EEOC\u2019s issuing right\nto-sue letters, petitioners amended their complaint to\nassert that the City violated the disparate-treatment\nprohibition contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, as amended. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(a).\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\nRespondents asserted they had a good-faith belief that\nthey would have violated the disparate-impact prohibition\nin Title VII, \u00a72000e\u20132(k), had they certified the examina\ntion results. It follows, they maintained, that they cannot\nbe held liable under Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment provi\nsion for attempting to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact bar. Petitioners countered that respondents\u2019 good\nfaith belief was not a valid defense to allegations of dispa\nrate treatment and unconstitutional discrimination.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nrespondents. 554 F. Supp. 2d 142. It described petition\ners\u2019 argument as \u201cboil[ing] down to the assertion that if\n[respondents] cannot prove that the disparities on the\nLieutenant and Captain exams were due to a particular\nflaw inherent in those exams, then they should have\ncertified the results because there was no other alterna\n16                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntive in place.\u201d Id., at 156. The District Court concluded\nthat, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the shortcomings in the evidence\non existing, effective alternatives, it is not the case that\n[respondents] must certify a test where they cannot pin\npoint its deficiency explaining its disparate impact . . .\nsimply because they have not yet formulated a better\nselection method.\u201d Ibid. It also ruled that respondents\u2019\n\u201cmotivation to avoid making promotions based on a test\nwith a racially disparate impact . . . does not, as a matter\nof law, constitute discriminatory intent\u201d under Title VII.\nId., at 160. The District Court rejected petitioners\u2019 equal\nprotection claim on the theory that respondents had not\nacted because of \u201cdiscriminatory animus\u201d toward petition\ners. Id., at 162. It concluded that respondents\u2019 actions\nwere not \u201cbased on race\u201d because \u201call applicants took the\nsame test, and the result was the same for all because the\ntest results were discarded and nobody was promoted.\u201d\nId., at 161.\n   After full briefing and argument by the parties, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed in a one-paragraph, unpub\nlished summary order; it later withdrew that order, issu\ning in its place a nearly identical, one-paragraph per\ncuriam opinion adopting the District Court\u2019s reasoning.\n530 F. 3d 87 (CA2 2008). Three days later, the Court of\nAppeals voted 7 to 6 to deny rehearing en banc, over writ\nten dissents by Chief Judge Jacobs and Judge Cabranes.\n530 F. 3d 88.\n   This action presents two provisions of Title VII to be\ninterpreted and reconciled, with few, if any, precedents in\nthe courts of appeals discussing the issue. Depending on\nthe resolution of the statutory claim, a fundamental con\nstitutional question could also arise. We found it prudent\nand appropriate to grant certiorari. 555 U.

A decision for petitioners on their\nstatutory claim would provide the relief sought, so we\nconsider it first. See Atkins v. Parker, 472 U. S. 115, 123\n(1985); Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51\n(1984) (per curiam) (\u201c[N]ormally the Court will not decide\na constitutional question if there is some other ground\nupon which to dispose of the case\u201d).\n                             A\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e et seq., as amended, prohibits employment dis\ncrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin. Title VII prohibits both intentional dis\ncrimination (known as \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d) as well as,\nin some cases, practices that are not intended to discrimi\nnate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse effect on\nminorities (known as \u201cdisparate impact\u201d).\n   As enacted in 1964, Title VII\u2019s principal nondiscrimina\ntion provision held employers liable only for disparate\ntreatment. That section retains its original wording to\nday. It makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ\nment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1); see also 78 Stat. 255.\nDisparate-treatment cases present \u201cthe most easily under\nstood type of discrimination,\u201d Teamsters v.

DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisparate-treatment plaintiff must establish \u201cthat the\ndefendant had a discriminatory intent or motive\u201d for\ntaking a job-related action. Id., at 986.\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not include an express\nprohibition on policies or practices that produce a dispa\nrate impact. But in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S.\n424 (1971), the Court interpreted the Act to prohibit, in\nsome cases, employers\u2019 facially neutral practices that, in\nfact, are \u201cdiscriminatory in operation.\u201d Id., at 431. The\nGriggs Court stated that the \u201ctouchstone\u201d for disparate\nimpact liability is the lack of \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d: \u201cIf an\nemployment practice which operates to exclude [minori\nties] cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the\npractice is prohibited.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 432 (em\nployer\u2019s burden to demonstrate that practice has \u201ca mani\nfest relationship to the employment in question\u201d); Albe\nmarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 425 (1975).\nUnder those precedents, if an employer met its burden by\nshowing that its practice was job-related, the plaintiff was\nrequired to show a legitimate alternative that would have\nresulted in less discrimination. Ibid. (allowing complain\ning party to show \u201cthat other tests or selection devices,\nwithout a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also\nserve the employer\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d).\n   Twenty years after Griggs, the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n105 Stat. 1071, was enacted. The Act included a provision\ncodifying the prohibition on disparate-impact discrimina\ntion. That provision is now in force along with the dispa\nrate-treatment section already noted. Under the dispa\nrate-impact statute, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie\nviolation by showing that an employer uses \u201ca particular\nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(i). An employer may defend\nagainst liability by demonstrating that the practice is \u201cjob\nrelated for the position in question and consistent with\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness necessity.\u201d Ibid. Even if the employer meets\nthat burden, however, a plaintiff may still succeed by\nshowing that the employer refuses to adopt an available\nalternative employment practice that has less disparate\nimpact and serves the employer\u2019s legitimate needs.\n\u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).\n                              B\n   Petitioners allege that when the CSB refused to certify\nthe captain and lieutenant exam results based on the race\nof the successful candidates, it discriminated against them\nin violation of Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment provision.\nThe City counters that its decision was permissible be\ncause the tests \u201cappear[ed] to violate Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact provisions.\u201d Brief for Respondents 12.\n   Our analysis begins with this premise: The City\u2019s ac\ntions would violate the disparate-treatment prohibition of\nTitle VII absent some valid defense. All the evidence\ndemonstrates that the City chose not to certify the exami\nnation results because of the statistical disparity based on\nrace\u2014i.e., how minority candidates had performed when\ncompared to white candidates. As the District Court put\nit, the City rejected the test results because \u201ctoo many\nwhites and not enough minorities would be promoted were\nthe lists to be certified.\u201d 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 152; see also\nibid. (respondents\u2019 \u201cown arguments . . . show that the\nCity\u2019s reasons for advocating non-certification were re\nlated to the racial distribution of the results\u201d). Without\nsome other justification, this express, race-based deci\nsionmaking violates Title VII\u2019s command that employers\ncannot take adverse employment actions because of an\nindividual\u2019s race. See \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1).\n   The District Court did not adhere to this principle,\nhowever. It held that respondents\u2019 \u201cmotivation to avoid\nmaking promotions based on a test with a racially dispa\nrate impact . . . does not, as a matter of law, constitute\n20                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 160. And the\nGovernment makes a similar argument in this Court. It\ncontends that the \u201cstructure of Title VII belies any claim\nthat an employer\u2019s intent to comply with Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-impact provisions constitutes prohibited discrimina\ntion on the basis of race.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11. But both of those statements turn\nupon the City\u2019s objective\u2014avoiding disparate-impact\nliability\u2014while ignoring the City\u2019s conduct in the name of\nreaching that objective. Whatever the City\u2019s ultimate\naim\u2014however well intentioned or benevolent it might\nhave seemed\u2014the City made its employment decision\nbecause of race. The City rejected the test results solely\nbecause the higher scoring candidates were white. The\nquestion is not whether that conduct was discriminatory\nbut whether the City had a lawful justification for its race\nbased action.\n   We consider, therefore, whether the purpose to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\nbe prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. Courts\noften confront cases in which statutes and principles point\nin different directions. Our task is to provide guidance to\nemployers and courts for situations when these two prohi\nbitions could be in conflict absent a rule to reconcile them.\nIn providing this guidance our decision must be consistent\nwith the important purpose of Title VII\u2014that the work\nplace be an environment free of discrimination, where race\nis not a barrier to opportunity.\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the parties\u2019\nproposed means of reconciling the statutory provisions.\nPetitioners take a strict approach, arguing that under\nTitle VII, it cannot be permissible for an employer to take\nrace-based adverse employment actions in order to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability\u2014even if the employer knows its\npractice violates the disparate-impact provision. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 43. Petitioners would have us hold that,\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder Title VII, avoiding unintentional discrimination\ncannot justify intentional discrimination. That assertion,\nhowever, ignores the fact that, by codifying the disparate\nimpact provision in 1991, Congress has expressly prohib\nited both types of discrimination. We must interpret the\nstatute to give effect to both provisions where possible.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Atlantic Research Corp.,\n551 U. S. 128, 137 (2007) (rejecting an interpretation\nthat would render a statutory provision \u201ca dead letter\u201d).\nWe cannot accept petitioners\u2019 broad and inflexible\nformulation.\n   Petitioners next suggest that an employer in fact must\nbe in violation of the disparate-impact provision before it\ncan use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment\nsuit. Again, this is overly simplistic and too restrictive of\nTitle VII\u2019s purpose. The rule petitioners offer would run\ncounter to what we have recognized as Congress\u2019s intent\nthat \u201cvoluntary compliance\u201d be \u201cthe preferred means of\nachieving the objectives of Title VII.\u201d Firefighters v. Cleve\nland, 478 U. S. 501, 515 (1986); see also Wygant v. Jack\nson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 290 (1986) (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Forbid\nding employers to act unless they know, with certainty,\nthat a practice violates the disparate-impact provision\nwould bring compliance efforts to a near standstill. Even\nin the limited situations when this restricted standard\ncould be met, employers likely would hesitate before tak\ning voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in\nthe course of litigation and then held to account for dispa\nrate treatment.\n   At the opposite end of the spectrum, respondents and\nthe Government assert that an employer\u2019s good-faith belief\nthat its actions are necessary to comply with Title VII\u2019s\ndisparate-impact provision should be enough to justify\nrace-conscious conduct. But the original, foundational\nprohibition of Title VII bars employers from taking ad\n22                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nverse action \u201cbecause of . . . race.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). And\nwhen Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in\n1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability\nfor actions taken in a good-faith effort to comply with the\nnew, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k). Allow\ning employers to violate the disparate-treatment prohibi\ntion based on a mere good-faith fear of disparate-impact\nliability would encourage race-based action at the slightest\nhint of disparate impact. A minimal standard could cause\nemployers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial\npromotional examinations even where there is little if any\nevidence of disparate-impact discrimination. That would\namount to a de facto quota system, in which a \u201cfocus on\nstatistics . . . could put undue pressure on employers to\nadopt inappropriate prophylactic measures.\u201d Watson, 487\nU. S., at 992 (plurality opinion). Even worse, an employer\ncould discard test results (or other employment practices)\nwith the intent of obtaining the employer\u2019s preferred racial\nbalance. That operational principle could not be justified,\nfor Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of\nits requirements as calling for outright racial balancing.\n\u00a72000e\u20132(j). The purpose of Title VII \u201cis to promote hiring\non the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis\nof race or color.\u201d Griggs, 401 U. S., at 434.\n    In searching for a standard that strikes a more appro\npriate balance, we note that this Court has considered\ncases similar to this one, albeit in the context of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The\nCourt has held that certain government actions to remedy\npast racial discrimination\u2014actions that are themselves\nbased on race\u2014are constitutional only where there is a\n\u201c \u2018strong basis in evidence\u2019 \u201d that the remedial actions were\nnecessary. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469,\n500 (1989) (quoting Wygant, supra, at 277 (plurality opin\nion)). This suit does not call on us to consider whether the\nstatutory constraints under Title VII must be parallel in\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall respects to those under the Constitution. That does not\nmean the constitutional authorities are irrelevant, how\never. Our cases discussing constitutional principles can\nprovide helpful guidance in this statutory context. See\nWatson, supra, at 993 (plurality opinion).\n   Writing for a plurality in Wygant and announcing the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard, Justice Powell recog\nnized the tension between eliminating segregation and\ndiscrimination on the one hand and doing away with all\ngovernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on\nthe other. 476 U. S., at 277. The plurality stated that\nthose \u201crelated constitutional duties are not always harmo\nnious,\u201d and that \u201creconciling them requires . . . employers\nto act with extraordinary care.\u201d Ibid. The plurality re\nquired a strong basis in evidence because \u201c[e]videntiary\nsupport for the conclusion that remedial action is war\nranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is\nchallenged in court by nonminority employees.\u201d Ibid. The\nCourt applied the same standard in Croson, observing that\n\u201can amorphous claim that there has been past discrimina\ntion . . . cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial\nquota.\u201d 488 U. S., at 499.\n   The same interests are at work in the interplay between\nthe disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions\nof Title VII. Congress has imposed liability on employers\nfor unintentional discrimination in order to rid the work\nplace of \u201cpractices that are fair in form, but discriminatory\nin operation.\u201d Griggs, supra, at 431. But it has also pro\nhibited employers from taking adverse employment ac\ntions \u201cbecause of\u201d race. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). Applying the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect\nto both the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact\nprovisions, allowing violations of one in the name of com\npliance with the other only in certain, narrow circum\nstances. The standard leaves ample room for employers\u2019\nvoluntary compliance efforts, which are essential to the\n24                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatutory scheme and to Congress\u2019s efforts to eradicate\nworkplace discrimination. See Firefighters, supra, at 515.\nAnd the standard appropriately constrains employers\u2019\ndiscretion in making race-based decisions: It limits that\ndiscretion to cases in which there is a strong basis in\nevidence of disparate-impact liability, but it is not so\nrestrictive that it allows employers to act only when there\nis a provable, actual violation.\n   Resolving the statutory conflict in this way allows the\ndisparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is\nconsistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the\nprohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores\non the basis of race. See \u00a72000e\u20132(l). Examinations like\nthose administered by the City create legitimate expecta\ntions on the part of those who took the tests. As is the\ncase with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters\nhere invested substantial time, money, and personal\ncommitment in preparing for the tests. Employment tests\ncan be an important part of a neutral selection system\nthat safeguards against the very racial animosities Title\nVII was intended to prevent. Here, however, the firefight\ners saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reli\nance upon race-based statistics.\n   If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candi\ndates\u2019 race, \u00a72000e\u20132(l), then it follows a fortiori that it\nmay not take the greater step of discarding the test alto\ngether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of\npromotion-eligible candidates\u2014absent a strong basis in\nevidence that the test was deficient and that discarding\nthe results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate\nimpact provision. Restricting an employer\u2019s ability to\ndiscard test results (and thereby discriminate against\nqualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in\nkeeping with Title VII\u2019s express protection of bona fide\npromotional examinations. See \u00a72000e\u20132(h) (\u201c[N]or shall\nit be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive and to act upon the results of any professionally\ndeveloped ability test provided that such test, its admini\nstration or action upon the results is not designed, in\ntended or used to discriminate because of race\u201d); cf. AT&T\nCorp. v. Hulteen, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8).\n  For the foregoing reasons, we adopt the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard as a matter of statutory construction to\nresolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact provisions of Title VII.\n  Our statutory holding does not address the constitution\nality of the measures taken here in purported compliance\nwith Title VII. We also do not hold that meeting the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard would satisfy the Equal\nProtection Clause in a future case. As we explain below,\nbecause respondents have not met their burden under\nTitle VII, we need not decide whether a legitimate fear of\ndisparate impact is ever sufficient to justify discriminatory\ntreatment under the Constitution.\n  Nor do we question an employer\u2019s affirmative efforts to\nensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for\npromotions and to participate in the process by which\npromotions will be made. But once that process has been\nestablished and employers have made clear their selection\ncriteria, they may not then invalidate the test results,\nthus upsetting an employee\u2019s legitimate expectation not to\nbe judged on the basis of race. Doing so, absent a strong\nbasis in evidence of an impermissible disparate impact,\namounts to the sort of racial preference that Congress has\ndisclaimed, \u00a72000e\u20132(j), and is antithetical to the notion of\na workplace where individuals are guaranteed equal\nopportunity regardless of race.\n  Title VII does not prohibit an employer from consider\ning, before administering a test or practice, how to design\nthat test or practice in order to provide a fair opportunity\nfor all individuals, regardless of their race. And when,\nduring the test-design stage, an employer invites com\n26                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nments to ensure the test is fair, that process can provide a\ncommon ground for open discussions toward that end. We\nhold only that, under Title VII, before an employer can\nengage in intentional discrimination for the asserted\npurpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional dispa\nrate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in\nevidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact\nliability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discrimina\ntory action.\n                              C\n   The City argues that, even under the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard, its decision to discard the examination\nresults was permissible under Title VII. That is incorrect.\nEven if respondents were motivated as a subjective matter\nby a desire to avoid committing disparate-impact dis\ncrimination, the record makes clear there is no support for\nthe conclusion that respondents had an objective, strong\nbasis in evidence to find the tests inadequate, with some\nconsequent disparate-impact liability in violation of Title\nVII.\n   On this basis, we conclude that petitioners have met\ntheir obligation to demonstrate that there is \u201cno genuine\nissue as to any material fact\u201d and that they are \u201centitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c).\nOn a motion for summary judgment, \u201cfacts must be viewed\nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if\nthere is a \u2018genuine\u2019 dispute as to those facts.\u201d Scott v.\nHarris, 550 U. S. 372, 380 (2007). \u201cWhere the record\ntaken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to\nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for\ntrial.\u201d Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio\nCorp., 475 U. S. 574, 587 (1986) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In this Court, the City\u2019s only defense is that it\nacted to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provi\nsion. To succeed on their motion, then, petitioners must\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndemonstrate that there can be no genuine dispute that\nthere was no strong basis in evidence for the City to con\nclude it would face disparate-impact liability if it certified\nthe examination results. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU. S. 317, 324 (1986) (where the nonmoving party \u201cwill\nbear the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue,\u201d the\nnonmoving party bears the burden of production under\nRule 56 to \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is\na genuine issue for trial\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n  The racial adverse impact here was significant, and\npetitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a\nprima facie case of disparate-impact liability. On the\ncaptain exam, the pass rate for white candidates was 64\npercent but was 37.5 percent for both black and Hispanic\ncandidates. On the lieutenant exam, the pass rate for\nwhite candidates was 58.1 percent; for black candidates,\n31.6 percent; and for Hispanic candidates, 20 percent. The\npass rates of minorities, which were approximately one\nhalf the pass rates for white candidates, fall well below the\n80-percent standard set by the EEOC to implement the\ndisparate-impact provision of Title VII. See 29 CFR\n\u00a71607.4(D) (2008) (selection rate that is less than 80 per\ncent \u201cof the rate for the group with the highest rate will\ngenerally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agen\ncies as evidence of adverse impact\u201d); Watson, 487 U. S., at\n995\u2013996, n. 3 (plurality opinion) (EEOC\u2019s 80-percent\nstandard is \u201ca rule of thumb for the courts\u201d). Based on\nhow the passing candidates ranked and an application of\nthe \u201crule of three,\u201d certifying the examinations would have\nmeant that the City could not have considered black can\ndidates for any of the then-vacant lieutenant or captain\npositions.\n  Based on the degree of adverse impact reflected in the\nresults, respondents were compelled to take a hard look at\nthe examinations to determine whether certifying the\n28                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresults would have had an impermissible disparate im\npact. The problem for respondents is that a prima facie\ncase of disparate-impact liability\u2014essentially, a threshold\nshowing of a significant statistical disparity, Connecticut\nv. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 446 (1982), and nothing more\u2014is\nfar from a strong basis in evidence that the City would\nhave been liable under Title VII had it certified the re\nsults. That is because the City could be liable for dispa\nrate-impact discrimination only if the examinations were\nnot job related and consistent with business necessity, or if\nthere existed an equally valid, less-discriminatory alterna\ntive that served the City\u2019s needs but that the City refused\nto adopt. \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A), (C). We conclude there is no\nstrong basis in evidence to establish that the test was\ndeficient in either of these respects. We address each of\nthe two points in turn, based on the record developed by\nthe parties through discovery\u2014a record that concentrates\nin substantial part on the statements various witnesses\nmade to the CSB.\n                              1\n  There is no genuine dispute that the examinations were\njob-related and consistent with business necessity. The\nCity\u2019s assertions to the contrary are \u201cblatantly contra\ndicted by the record.\u201d Scott, supra, at 380. The CSB\nheard statements from Chad Legel (the IOS vice presi\ndent) as well as city officials outlining the detailed steps\nIOS took to develop and administer the examinations.\nIOS devised the written examinations, which were the\nfocus of the CSB\u2019s inquiry, after painstaking analyses of\nthe captain and lieutenant positions\u2014analyses in which\nIOS made sure that minorities were overrepresented. And\nIOS drew the questions from source material approved by\nthe Department. Of the outside witnesses who appeared\nbefore the CSB, only one, Vincent Lewis, had reviewed the\nexaminations in any detail, and he was the only one with\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Lewis stated that the \u201cques\ntions were relevant for both exams.\u201d CA2 App. A1053.\nThe only other witness who had seen any part of the ex\naminations, Christopher Hornick (a competitor of IOS\u2019s),\ncriticized the fact that no one within the Department had\nreviewed the tests\u2014a condition imposed by the City to\nprotect the integrity of the exams in light of past alleged\nsecurity breaches. But Hornick stated that the exams\n\u201cappea[r] to be . . . reasonably good\u201d and recommended that\nthe CSB certify the results. Id., at A1041.\n   Arguing that the examinations were not job-related,\nrespondents note some candidates\u2019 complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not spe\ncifically apply to firefighting practices in New Haven. But\nLegel told the CSB that IOS had addressed those con\ncerns\u2014that it entertained \u201ca handful\u201d of challenges to the\nvalidity of particular examination questions, that it \u201cre\nviewed those challenges and provided feedback [to the\nCity] as to what we thought the best course of action was,\u201d\nand that he could remember at least one question IOS had\nthrown out (\u201coffer[ing] credit to everybody for that particu\nlar question\u201d). Id., at A955\u2013A957. For his part, Hornick\nsaid he \u201csuspect[ed] that some of the criticisms . . . [lev\neled] by candidates\u201d were not valid. Id., at A1035.\n   The City, moreover, turned a blind eye to evidence that\nsupported the exams\u2019 validity. Although the City\u2019s con\ntract with IOS contemplated that IOS would prepare a\ntechnical report consistent with EEOC guidelines for\nexamination-validity studies, the City made no request for\nits report. After the January 2004 meeting between Legel\nand some of the city-official respondents, in which Legel\ndefended the examinations, the City sought no further\ninformation from IOS, save its appearance at a CSB meet\ning to explain how it developed and administered the\nexaminations. IOS stood ready to provide respondents\nwith detailed information to establish the validity of the\n30                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexams, but respondents did not accept that offer.\n                              2\n   Respondents also lacked a strong basis in evidence of an\nequally valid, less-discriminatory testing alternative that\nthe City, by certifying the examination results, would\nnecessarily have refused to adopt. Respondents raise\nthree arguments to the contrary, but each argument fails.\nFirst, respondents refer to testimony before the CSB that\na different composite-score calculation\u2014weighting the\nwritten and oral examination scores 30/70\u2014would have\nallowed the City to consider two black candidates for then\nopen lieutenant positions and one black candidate for\nthen-open captain positions. (The City used a 60/40\nweighting as required by its contract with the New Haven\nfirefighters\u2019 union.) But respondents have produced no\nevidence to show that the 60/40 weighting was indeed\narbitrary. In fact, because that formula was the result of a\nunion-negotiated collective-bargaining agreement, we\npresume the parties negotiated that weighting for a ra\ntional reason. Nor does the record contain any evidence\nthat the 30/70 weighting would be an equally valid way to\ndetermine whether candidates possess the proper mix of\njob knowledge and situational skills to earn promotions.\nChanging the weighting formula, moreover, could well\nhave violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition of altering test scores\non the basis of race. See \u00a72000e\u20132(l). On this record,\nthere is no basis to conclude that a 30/70 weighting was an\nequally valid alternative the City could have adopted.\n   Second, respondents argue that the City could have\nadopted a different interpretation of the \u201crule of three\u201d\nthat would have produced less discriminatory results. The\nrule, in the New Haven city charter, requires the City to\npromote only from \u201cthose applicants with the three high\nest scores\u201d on a promotional examination. New Haven,\nConn., Code of Ordinances, Tit. I, Art. XXX, \u00a7160 (1992).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nA state court has interpreted the charter to prohibit so\ncalled \u201cbanding\u201d\u2014the City\u2019s previous practice of rounding\nscores to the nearest whole number and considering all\ncandidates with the same whole-number score as being of\none rank. Banding allowed the City to consider three\nranks of candidates (with the possibility of multiple candi\ndates filling each rank) for purposes of the rule of three.\nSee Kelly v. New Haven, No. CV000444614, 2004 WL\n114377, *3 (Conn. Super. Ct., Jan. 9, 2004). Respondents\nclaim that employing banding here would have made four\nblack and one Hispanic candidates eligible for then-open\nlieutenant and captain positions.\n   A state court\u2019s prohibition of banding, as a matter of\nmunicipal law under the charter, may not eliminate band\ning as a valid alternative under Title VII. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u20137. We need not resolve that point, however. Here,\nbanding was not a valid alternative for this reason: Had\nthe City reviewed the exam results and then adopted\nbanding to make the minority test scores appear higher, it\nwould have violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition of adjusting\ntest results on the basis of race. \u00a72000e\u20132(l); see also\nChicago Firefighters Local 2 v. Chicago, 249 F. 3d 649, 656\n(CA7 2001) (Posner, J.) (\u201cWe have no doubt that if banding\nwere adopted in order to make lower black scores seem\nhigher, it would indeed be . . . forbidden\u201d). As a matter of\nlaw, banding was not an alternative available to the City\nwhen it was considering whether to certify the examina\ntion results.\n   Third, and finally, respondents refer to statements by\nHornick in his telephone interview with the CSB regard\ning alternatives to the written examinations. Hornick\nstated his \u201cbelie[f]\u201d that an \u201cassessment center process,\u201d\nwhich would have evaluated candidates\u2019 behavior in typi\ncal job tasks, \u201cwould have demonstrated less adverse\nimpact.\u201d CA2 App. A1039. But Hornick\u2019s brief mention of\nalternative testing methods, standing alone, does not raise\n32                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na genuine issue of material fact that assessment centers\nwere available to the City at the time of the examinations\nand that they would have produced less adverse impact.\nOther statements to the CSB indicated that the Depart\nment could not have used assessment centers for the 2003\nexaminations. Supra, at 14. And although respondents\nlater argued to the CSB that Hornick had pushed the City\nto reject the test results, supra, at 15\u201317, the truth is that\nthe essence of Hornick\u2019s remarks supported its certifying\nthe test results. See Scott, 550 U. S., at 380. Hornick\nstated that adverse impact in standardized testing \u201chas\nbeen in existence since the beginning of testing,\u201d CA2 App.\nA1037, and that the disparity in New Haven\u2019s test results\nwas \u201csomewhat higher but generally in the range that\nwe\u2019ve seen professionally.\u201d Id., at A1030\u2013A1031. He told\nthe CSB he was \u201cnot suggesting\u201d that IOS \u201csomehow\ncreated a test that had adverse impacts that it should not\nhave had.\u201d Id., at A1038. And he suggested that the CSB\nshould \u201ccertify the list as it exists.\u201d Id., at A1041.\n  Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard applies, respondents cannot create a\ngenuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradic\ntory) statements in the record. And there is no doubt\nrespondents fall short of the mark by relying entirely on\nisolated statements by Hornick.              Hornick had not\n\u201cstud[ied] the test at length or in detail.\u201d Id., at A1030.\nAnd as he told the CSB, he is a \u201cdirect competitor\u201d of\nIOS\u2019s. Id., at A1029. The remainder of his remarks\nshowed that Hornick\u2019s primary concern\u2014somewhat to the\nfrustration of CSB members\u2014was marketing his services\nfor the future, not commenting on the results of the tests\nthe City had already administered. See, e.g., id., at\nA1026, A1027, A1032, A1036, A1040, A1041. Hornick\u2019s\nhinting had its intended effect: The City has since hired\nhim as a consultant. As for the other outside witnesses\nwho spoke to the CSB, Vincent Lewis (the retired fire\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncaptain) thought the CSB should certify the test results.\nAnd Janet Helms (the Boston College professor) declined\nto review the examinations and told the CSB that, as a\nsociety, \u201cwe need to develop a new way of assessing peo\nple.\u201d Id., at A1073. That task was beyond the reach of the\nCSB, which was concerned with the adequacy of the test\nresults before it.\n                             3\n  On the record before us, there is no genuine dispute that\nthe City lacked a strong basis in evidence to believe it\nwould face disparate-impact liability if it certified the\nexamination results. In other words, there is no evidence\n\u2014let alone the required strong basis in evidence\u2014that the\ntests were flawed because they were not job-related or\nbecause other, equally valid and less discriminatory tests\nwere available to the City. Fear of litigation alone cannot\njustify an employer\u2019s reliance on race to the detriment of\nindividuals who passed the examinations and qualified for\npromotions. The City\u2019s discarding the test results was\nimpermissible under Title VII, and summary judgment is\nappropriate for petitioners on their disparate-treatment\nclaim.\n                          *    *     *\n   The record in this litigation documents a process that, at\nthe outset, had the potential to produce a testing proce\ndure that was true to the promise of Title VII: No individ\nual should face workplace discrimination based on race.\nRespondents thought about promotion qualifications and\nrelevant experience in neutral ways. They were careful to\nensure broad racial participation in the design of the test\nitself and its administration. As we have discussed at\nlength, the process was open and fair.\n   The problem, of course, is that after the tests were\ncompleted, the raw racial results became the predominant\n34                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrationale for the City\u2019s refusal to certify the results. The\ninjury arises in part from the high, and justified, expecta\ntions of the candidates who had participated in the testing\nprocess on the terms the City had established for the\npromotional process. Many of the candidates had studied\nfor months, at considerable personal and financial ex\npense, and thus the injury caused by the City\u2019s reliance on\nraw racial statistics at the end of the process was all the\nmore severe. Confronted with arguments both for and\nagainst certifying the test results\u2014and threats of a law\nsuit either way\u2014the City was required to make a difficult\ninquiry. But its hearings produced no strong evidence of a\ndisparate-impact violation, and the City was not entitled\nto disregard the tests based solely on the racial disparity\nin the results.\n   Our holding today clarifies how Title VII applies to\nresolve competing expectations under the disparate\ntreatment and disparate-impact provisions. If, after it\ncertifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact\nsuit, then in light of our holding today it should be clear\nthat the City would avoid disparate-impact liability based\non the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified\nthe results, it would have been subject to disparate\ntreatment liability.\n   Petitioners are entitled to summary judgment on their\nTitle VII claim, and we therefore need not decide the\nunderlying constitutional question. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

The question is not an easy one. See\ngenerally Primus, Equal Protection and Disparate Impact:\nRound Three, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 493 (2003).\n   The difficulty is this: Whether or not Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-treatment provisions forbid \u201cremedial\u201d race-based\nactions when a disparate-impact violation would not oth\nerwise result\u2014the question resolved by the Court today\u2014\nit is clear that Title VII not only permits but affirmatively\nrequires such actions when a disparate-impact violation\nwould otherwise result. See ante, at 20\u201321. But if the\nFederal Government is prohibited from discriminating on\nthe basis of race, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 500\n(1954), then surely it is also prohibited from enacting laws\n2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nmandating that third parties\u2014e.g., employers, whether\nprivate, State, or municipal\u2014discriminate on the basis of\nrace. See Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 78\u201382 (1917).\nAs the facts of these cases illustrate, Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact provisions place a racial thumb on the scales, often\nrequiring employers to evaluate the racial outcomes of\ntheir policies, and to make decisions based on (because of)\nthose racial outcomes. That type of racial decisionmaking\nis, as the Court explains, discriminatory. See ante, at 19;\nPersonnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256,\n279 (1979).\n   To be sure, the disparate-impact laws do not mandate\nimposition of quotas, but it is not clear why that should\nprovide a safe harbor. Would a private employer not be\nguilty of unlawful discrimination if he refrained from\nestablishing a racial hiring quota but intentionally de\nsigned his hiring practices to achieve the same end?\nSurely he would. Intentional discrimination is still occur\nring, just one step up the chain. Government compulsion\nof such design would therefore seemingly violate equal\nprotection principles. Nor would it matter that Title VII\nrequires consideration of race on a wholesale, rather than\nretail, level. \u201c[T]he Government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, not as simply components of a racial, reli\ngious, sexual or national class.\u201d Miller v. Johnson, 515\nU. S. 900, 911 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd of course the purportedly benign motive for the dispa\nrate-impact provisions cannot save the statute. See Ada\u00ad\nrand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995).\n   It might be possible to defend the law by framing it as\nsimply an evidentiary tool used to identify genuine, inten\ntional discrimination\u2014to \u201csmoke out,\u201d as it were, dispa\nrate treatment. See Primus, supra, at 498\u2013499, 520\u2013521.\nDisparate impact is sometimes (though not always, see\nWatson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 992\n(1988) (plurality opinion)) a signal of something illicit, so a\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802\u2013803 (1973). But argua\nbly the disparate-impact provisions sweep too broadly to\nbe fairly characterized in such a fashion\u2014since they fail to\nprovide an affirmative defense for good-faith (i.e., nonra\ncially motivated) conduct, or perhaps even for good faith\nplus hiring standards that are entirely reasonable. See\npost, at 15\u201316, and n. 1 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (de\nscribing the demanding nature of the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d\ndefense). This is a question that this Court will have to\nconsider in due course. It is one thing to free plaintiffs\nfrom proving an employer\u2019s illicit intent, but quite another\nto preclude the employer from proving that its motives\nwere pure and its actions reasonable.\n  The Court\u2019s resolution of these cases makes it unneces\nsary to resolve these matters today. But the war between\ndisparate impact and equal protection will be waged\nsooner or later, and it behooves us to begin thinking about\nhow\u2014and on what terms\u2014to make peace between them.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

I write separately only\nbecause the dissent, while claiming that \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s\nrecitation of the facts leaves out important parts of the\nstory,\u201d post, at 2 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.), provides an\nincomplete description of the events that led to New Ha\nven\u2019s decision to reject the results of its exam. The dis\nsent\u2019s omissions are important because, when all of the\nevidence in the record is taken into account, it is clear\nthat, even if the legal analysis in Parts II and III\u2013A of the\ndissent were accepted, affirmance of the decision below is\nuntenable.\n                            I\n  When an employer in a disparate-treatment case under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 claims that an\nemployment decision, such as the refusal to promote, was\nbased on a legitimate reason, two questions\u2014one objective\nand one subjective\u2014must be decided. The first, objective\nquestion is whether the reason given by the employer is\n2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\none that is legitimate under Title VII. See St. Mary\u2019s\nHonor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 506\u2013507 (1993). If\nthe reason provided by the employer is not legitimate on\nits face, the employer is liable. Id., at 509. The second,\nsubjective question concerns the employer\u2019s intent. If an\nemployer offers a facially legitimate reason for its decision\nbut it turns out that this explanation was just a pretext\nfor discrimination, the employer is again liable. See id., at\n510\u2013512.\n   The question on which the opinion of the Court and the\ndissenting opinion disagree concerns the objective compo\nnent of the determination that must be made when an\nemployer justifies an employment decision, like the one\nmade in this litigation, on the ground that a contrary\ndecision would have created a risk of disparate-impact\nliability. The Court holds\u2014and I entirely agree\u2014that\nconcern about disparate-impact liability is a legitimate\nreason for a decision of the type involved here only if there\nwas a \u201csubstantial basis in evidence to find the tests in\nadequate.\u201d Ante, at 26. The Court ably demonstrates that\nin this litigation no reasonable jury could find that the city\nof New Haven (City) possessed such evidence and there\nfore summary judgment for petitioners is required. Be\ncause the Court correctly holds that respondents cannot\nsatisfy this objective component, the Court has no need to\ndiscuss the question of the respondents\u2019 actual intent. As\nthe Court puts it, \u201c[e]ven if respondents were motivated as\na subjective matter by a desire to avoid committing dispa\nrate-impact discrimination, the record makes clear there\nis no support for the conclusion that respondents had an\nobjective, substantial basis in evidence to find the tests\ninadequate.\u201d Ibid.\n   The dissent advocates a different objective component of\nthe governing standard. According to the dissent, the\nobjective component should be whether the evidence pro\nvided \u201cgood cause\u201d for the decision, post, at 19, and the\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

But even if the dissent were correct on this point, I\nassume that the dissent would not countenance summary\njudgment for respondents if respondents\u2019 professed con\ncern about disparate-impact litigation was simply a pre\ntext. Therefore, the decision below, which sustained the\nentry of summary judgment for respondents, cannot be\naffirmed unless no reasonable jury could find that the\nCity\u2019s asserted reason for scrapping its test\u2014concern\nabout disparate-impact liability\u2014was a pretext and that\nthe City\u2019s real reason was illegitimate, namely, the desire\nto placate a politically important racial constituency.\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n   As initially described by the dissent, see post, at 2\u201312,\nthe process by which the City reached the decision not to\naccept the test results was open, honest, serious, and\ndeliberative.

Id., at 815a\u2013816a. As discussed in further detail\nbelow, Rev. Kimber adamantly opposed certification of the\ntest results\u2014a fact that he or someone in the Mayor\u2019s\noffice eventually conveyed to the Mayor. Id., at 229a.\n                              B\n  On January 12, 2004, Tina Burgett (the director of the\nCity\u2019s Department of Human Resources) sent an e-mail to\nDubois-Walton to coordinate the City\u2019s response to the test\nresults. Burgett wanted to clarify that the City\u2019s executive\nofficials would meet \u201csans the Chief, and that once we had\na better fix on the next steps we would meet with the\nMayor (possibly) and then the two Chiefs.\u201d Id., at 446a.\nThe \u201ctwo Chiefs\u201d are Fire Chief William Grant (who is\nwhite) and Assistant Fire Chief Ronald Dumas (who is\nAfrican-American). Both chiefs believed that the test\nresults should be certified. Id., at 228a, 817a. Petitioners\nallege, and the record suggests, that the Mayor and his\nstaff colluded \u201csans the Chief[s]\u201d because \u201cthe defendants\ndid not want Grant\u2019s or Dumas\u2019 views to be publicly\nknown; accordingly both men were prevented by the\nMayor and his staff from making any statements regard\ning the matter.\u201d Id., at 228a.1\n  The next day, on January 13, 2004, Chad Legel, who\nhad designed the tests, flew from Chicago to New Haven\nto meet with Dubois-Walton, Burgett, and Thomas Ude,\nthe City\u2019s corporate counsel. Id., at 179a. \u201cLegel outlined\nthe merits of the examination and why city officials should\nbe confident in the validity of the results.\u201d Ibid. But\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although the dissent disputes it, see post, at 33\u201334, n. 17, the record\ncertainly permits the inference that petitioners\u2019 allegation is true. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, pp. 846a\u2013851a (deposition of\nDubois-Walton).\n6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\naccording to Legel, Dubois-Walton was \u201cargumentative\u201d\nand apparently had already made up her mind that the\ntests were \u201c \u2018discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 179a\u2013180a. Again\naccording to Legel, \u201c[a] theme\u201d of the meeting was \u201cthe\npolitical and racial overtones of what was going on in the\nCity.\u201d Id., at 181a. \u201cLegel came away from the January\n13, 2004 meeting with the impression that defendants\nwere already leaning toward discarding the examination\nresults.\u201d Id., at 180a.\n  On January 22, 2004, the Civil Service Board (CSB or\nBoard) convened its first public meeting. Almost immedi\nately, Rev. Kimber began to exert political pressure on the\nCSB. He began a loud, minutes-long outburst that re\nquired the CSB Chairman to shout him down and hold\nhim out of order three times. See id., at 187a, 467a\u2013468a;\nsee also App. in No. 06\u20134996\u2013cv (CA2), pp. A703\u2013A705.\nReverend Kimber protested the public meeting, arguing\nthat he and the other fire commissioners should first be\nallowed to meet with the CSB in private. App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 188a.\n  Four days after the CSB\u2019s first meeting, Mayor DeSte\nfano\u2019s executive aide sent an e-mail to Dubois-Walton,\nBurgett, and Ude. Id., at 190a. The message clearly\nindicated that the Mayor had made up his mind to oppose\ncertification of the test results (but nevertheless wanted to\nconceal that fact from the public):\n    \u201cI wanted to make sure we are all on the same page\n    for this meeting tomorrow. . . . [L]et\u2019s remember, that\n    these folks are not against certification yet. So we\n    can\u2019t go in and tell them that is our position; we have\n    to deliberate and arrive there as the fairest and most\n    cogent outcome.\u201d Ibid.\n  On February 5, 2004, the CSB convened its second\npublic meeting. Reverend Kimber again testified and\nthreatened the CSB with political recriminations if they\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

I look at three whites\n    and one Hispanic and no blacks. . . . I would hope that\n    you would not put yourself in this type of position, a\n    political ramification that may come back upon you as\n    you sit on this [Board] and decide the future of a\n    department and the future of those who are being\n    promoted.\n    .           .           .          .           .\n    \u201c(APPLAUSE).\u201d Id., at 492a (emphasis added).\nOne of the CSB members \u201ct[ook] great offense\u201d because he\nbelieved that Rev. Kimber \u201cconsider[ed] [him] a bigot\nbecause [his] face is white.\u201d Id., at 496a. The offended\nCSB member eventually voted not to certify the test re\nsults. Id., at 586a\u2013587a.\n   One of Rev. Kimber\u2019s \u201cfriends and allies,\u201d Lieutenant\nGary Tinney, also exacerbated racial tensions before the\nCSB. Id., at 129a. After some firefighters applauded in\nsupport of certifying the test results, \u201cLt. Tinney ex\nclaimed, \u2018Listen to the Klansmen behind us.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 225a.\n   Tinney also has strong ties to the Mayor\u2019s office. See,\ne.g., id., at 129a\u2013130a, 816a\u2013817a. After learning that he\nhad not scored well enough on the captain\u2019s exam to earn\na promotion, Tinney called Dubois-Walton and arranged a\nmeeting in her office. Id., at 830a\u2013831a, 836a. Tinney\nalleged that the white firefighters had cheated on their\nexams\u2014an accusation that Dubois-Walton conveyed to the\nBoard without first conducting an investigation into its\nveracity. Id., at 837a\u2013838a; see also App. 164 (statement\nof CSB Chairman, noting the allegations of cheating). The\nallegation turned out to be baseless. App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 07\u20131428, at 836a.\n   Dubois-Walton never retracted the cheating allegation,\nbut she and other executive officials testified several times\nbefore the CSB. In accordance with directions from the\n8                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\nMayor\u2019s office to make the CSB meetings appear delibera\ntive, see id., at 190a, executive officials remained publicly\nuncommitted about certification\u2014while simultaneously\n\u201cwork[ing] as a team\u201d behind closed doors with the secre\ntary of the CSB to devise a political message that would\nconvince the CSB to vote against certification, see id., at\n447a. At the public CSB meeting on March 11, 2004, for\nexample, Corporation Counsel Ude bristled at one board\nmember\u2019s suggestion that City officials were recommend\ning against certifying the test results. See id., at 215a\n(\u201cAttorney Ude took offense, stating, \u2018Frankly, because I\nwould never make a recommendation\u2014I would not have\nmade a recommendation like that\u2019 \u201d). But within days of\nmaking that public statement, Ude privately told other\nmembers of the Mayor\u2019s team \u201cthe ONLY way we get to a\ndecision not to certify is\u201d to focus on something other than\n\u201ca big discussion re: adverse impact\u201d law. Id., at 458a\u2013\n459a.\n   As part of its effort to deflect attention from the specifics\nof the test, the City relied heavily on the testimony of Dr.\nChristopher Hornick, who is one of Chad Legel\u2019s competi\ntors in the test-development business. Hornick never\n\u201cstud[ied] the test [that Legel developed] at length or in\ndetail,\u201d id., at 549a; see also id., at 203a, 553a, but Hor\nnick did review and rely upon literature sent to him by\nBurgett to criticize Legel\u2019s test. For example, Hornick\n\u201cnoted in the literature that [Burgett] sent that the test\nwas not customized to the New Haven Fire Department.\u201d\nId., at 551a. The Chairman of the CSB immediately cor\nrected Hornick. Id., at 552a (\u201cActually, it was, Dr. Hor\nnick\u201d). Hornick also relied on newspaper accounts\u2014again,\nsent to him by Burgett\u2014pertaining to the controversy\nsurrounding the certification decision. See id., at 204a,\n557a. Although Hornick again admitted that he had no\nknowledge about the actual test that Legel had developed\nand that the City had administered, see id., at 560a\u2013561a,\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          ALITO, J., concurring\n\nthe City repeatedly relied upon Hornick as a testing\n\u201cguru\u201d and, in the CSB Chairman\u2019s words, \u201cthe City ke[pt]\nquoting him as a person that we should rely upon more\nthan anybody else [to conclude that there] is a better\nway\u2014a better mousetrap.\u201d2 App. in No. 06\u20134996\u2013cv\n(CA2), at A1128. Dubois-Walton later admitted that the\nCity rewarded Hornick for his testimony by hiring him to\ndevelop and administer an alternative test. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 854a; see also id., at 562a\u2013\n563a (Hornick\u2019s plea for future business from the City on\nthe basis of his criticisms of Legel\u2019s tests).\n   At some point prior to the CSB\u2019s public meeting on\nMarch 18, 2004, the Mayor decided to use his executive\nauthority to disregard the test results\u2014even if the CSB\nultimately voted to certify them. Id., at 819a\u2013820a. Ac\ncordingly, on the evening of March 17th, Dubois-Walton\nsent an e-mail to the Mayor, the Mayor\u2019s executive assis\ntant, Burgett, and attorney Ude, attaching two alternative\npress releases. Id., at 457a. The first would be issued if\nthe CSB voted not to certify the test results; the second\nwould be issued (and would explain the Mayor\u2019s invocation\nof his executive authority) if the CSB voted to certify the\ntest results. Id., at 217a\u2013218a, 590a\u2013591a, 819a\u2013820a.\nHalf an hour after Dubois-Walton circulated the alterna\ntive drafts, Burgett replied: \u201c[W]ell, that seems to say it\nall.

See supra, at 5. While Hornick\nknew little or nothing about the tests he criticized, the two chiefs were\ninvolved \u201cduring the lengthy process that led to the devising of the\nadministration of these exams,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428,\nat 847a, including \u201ccollaborating with City officials on the extensive job\nanalyses that were done,\u201d \u201cselection of the oral panelists,\u201d and selection\nof \u201cthe proper content and subject matter of the exams,\u201d id., at 847a\u2013\n848a.\n10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Soon after the CSB voted against certification, Mayor\nDeStefano appeared at a dinner event and \u201ctook credit for\nthe scu[tt]ling of the examination results.\u201d Id., at 230a.\n                              C\n   Taking into account all the evidence in the summary\njudgment record, a reasonable jury could find the follow\ning. Almost as soon as the City disclosed the racial\nmakeup of the list of firefighters who scored the highest on\nthe exam, the City administration was lobbied by an\ninfluential community leader to scrap the test results, and\nthe City administration decided on that course of action\nbefore making any real assessment of the possibility of a\ndisparate-impact violation. To achieve that end, the City\nadministration concealed its internal decision but\nworked\u2014as things turned out, successfully\u2014to persuade\nthe CSB that acceptance of the test results would be ille\ngal and would expose the City to disparate-impact liabil\nity. But in the event that the CSB was not persuaded, the\nMayor, wielding ultimate decisionmaking authority, was\nprepared to overrule the CSB immediately. Taking this\nview of the evidence, a reasonable jury could easily find\nthat the City\u2019s real reason for scrapping the test results\nwas not a concern about violating the disparate-impact\nprovision of Title VII but a simple desire to please a politi\ncally important racial constituency. It is noteworthy that\nthe Solicitor General\u2014whose position on the principal\nlegal issue in this case is largely aligned with the dis\nsent\u2014concludes that \u201c[n]either the district court nor the\ncourt of appeals . . . adequately considered whether, view\ning the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioners,\na genuine issue of material fact remained whether respon\ndents\u2019 claimed purpose to comply with Title VII was a\npretext for intentional racial discrimination . . . .\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 6; see also id., at 32\u2013\n33.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The dissent misrepresents my posi\ntion: I draw no such equation. Of course \u201cthere are many\nways in which a politician can attempt to win over a con\nstituency\u2014including a racial constituency\u2014without en\ngaging in unlawful discrimination.\u201d Post, at 36\u201337. But\u2014\nas I assume the dissent would agree\u2014there are some\nthings that a public official cannot do, and one of those is\nengaging in intentional racial discrimination when mak\ning employment decisions.\n   The second point concerns the dissent\u2019s main argu\nment\u2014that efforts by the Mayor and his staff to scuttle\nthe test results are irrelevant because the ultimate deci\nsion was made by the CSB. According to the dissent,\n\u201c[t]he relevant decision was made by the CSB,\u201d post, at 34,\nand there is \u201cscant cause to suspect\u201d that anything done\nby the opponents of certification, including the Mayor and\nhis staff, \u201cprevented the CSB from evenhandedly assess\ning the reliability of the exams and rendering an inde\npendent, good-faith decision on certification,\u201d post, at 36.\n   Adoption of the dissent\u2019s argument would implicitly\ndecide an important question of Title VII law that this\nCourt has never resolved\u2014the circumstances in which an\nemployer may be held liable based on the discriminatory\nintent of subordinate employees who influence but do not\nmake the ultimate employment decision. There is a large\nbody of court of appeals case law on this issue, and these\ncases disagree about the proper standard. See EEOC v.\nBCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 450 F. 3d 476,\n484\u2013488 (CA10 2006) (citing cases and describing the\napproaches taken in different Circuits). One standard is\nwhether the subordinate \u201cexerted influenc[e] over the\n12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntitular decisionmaker.\u201d Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Ven\nture, 235 F. 3d 219, 227 (CA5 2000); see also Poland v.\nChertoff, 494 F. 3d 1174, 1182 (CA9 2007) (A subordinate\u2019s\nbias is imputed to the employer where the subordinate\n\u201cinfluenced or was involved in the decision or decision\nmaking process\u201d). Another is whether the discriminatory\ninput \u201ccaused the adverse employment action.\u201d See BCI\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, supra, at 487.\n   In the present cases, a reasonable jury could certainly\nfind that these standards were met. The dissent makes\nmuch of the fact that members of the CSB swore under\noath that their votes were based on the good-faith belief\nthat certification of the results would have violated federal\nlaw. See post, at 34. But the good faith of the CSB mem\nbers would not preclude a finding that the presentations\nengineered by the Mayor and his staff influenced or\ncaused the CSB decision.\n   The least employee-friendly standard asks only whether\n\u201cthe actual decisionmaker\u201d acted with discriminatory\nintent, see Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Management,\nInc., 354 F. 3d 277, 291 (CA4 2004) (en banc), and it is\ntelling that, even under this standard, summary judgment\nfor respondents would not be proper. This is so because a\nreasonable jury could certainly find that in New Haven,\nthe Mayor\u2014not the CSB\u2014wielded the final decisionmak\ning power. After all, the Mayor claimed that authority\nand was poised to use it in the event that the CSB decided\nto accept the test results. See supra, at 9. If the Mayor\nhad the authority to overrule a CSB decision accepting the\ntest results, the Mayor also presumably had the authority\nto overrule the CSB\u2019s decision rejecting the test results. In\nlight of the Mayor\u2019s conduct, it would be quite wrong to\nthrow out petitioners\u2019 case on the ground that the CSB\nwas the ultimate decisionmaker.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

In so holding, the Court pretends\nthat \u201c[t]he City rejected the test results solely because the\nhigher scoring candidates were white.\u201d Ante, at 20. That\npretension, essential to the Court\u2019s disposition, ignores\nsubstantial evidence of multiple flaws in the tests New\nHaven used. The Court similarly fails to acknowledge the\nbetter tests used in other cities, which have yielded less\nracially skewed outcomes.1\n   By order of this Court, New Haven, a city in which\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics account for nearly 60\npercent of the population, must today be served\u2014as it was\nin the days of undisguised discrimination\u2014by a fire de\npartment in which members of racial and ethnic minori\nties are rarely seen in command positions. In arriving at\nits order, the Court barely acknowledges the pathmarking\ndecision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971),\nwhich explained the centrality of the disparate-impact\nconcept to effective enforcement of Title VII. The Court\u2019s\norder and opinion, I anticipate, will not have staying\npower.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Court\u2019s recitation of the facts leaves out important\nparts of the story. Firefighting is a profession in which the\nlegacy of racial discrimination casts an especially long\nshadow. In extending Title VII to state and local govern\nment employers in 1972, Congress took note of a U. S.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Never\n          mind the flawed tests New Haven used and the better selec\ntion methods used elsewhere, JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurring opinion urges.\nOverriding all else, racial politics, fired up by a strident African-\nAmerican pastor, were at work in New Haven. See ante, at 4\u20139. Even\na detached and disinterested observer, however, would have every\nreason to ask: Why did such racially skewed results occur in New\nHaven, when better tests likely would have produced less dispropor\ntionate results?\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nCommission on Civil Rights (USCCR) report finding racial\ndiscrimination in municipal employment even \u201cmore\npervasive than in the private sector.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 92\u2013\n238, p. 17 (1971). According to the report, overt racism\nwas partly to blame, but so too was a failure on the part of\nmunicipal employers to apply merit-based employment\nprinciples. In making hiring and promotion decisions,\npublic employers often \u201crel[ied] on criteria unrelated to job\nperformance,\u201d including nepotism or political patronage.\n118 Cong. Rec. 1817 (1972). Such flawed selection meth\nods served to entrench preexisting racial hierarchies. The\nUSCCR report singled out police and fire departments for\nhaving \u201c[b]arriers to equal employment . . . greater . . .\nthan in any other area of State or local government,\u201d with\nAfrican-Americans \u201chold[ing] almost no positions in the\nofficer ranks.\u201d Ibid. See also National Commission on\nFire Prevention and Control, America Burning 5 (1973)\n(\u201cRacial minorities are under-represented in the fire de\npartments in nearly every community in which they\nlive.\u201d).\n   The city of New Haven (City) was no exception. In the\nearly 1970\u2019s, African-Americans and Hispanics composed\n30 percent of New Haven\u2019s population, but only 3.6 per\ncent of the City\u2019s 502 firefighters. The racial disparity in\nthe officer ranks was even more pronounced: \u201c[O]f the 107\nofficers in the Department only one was black, and he held\nthe lowest rank above private.\u201d Firebird Soc. of New\nHaven, Inc. v. New Haven Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs, 66 F. R. D.\n457, 460 (Conn. 1975).\n   Following a lawsuit and settlement agreement, see ibid.,\nthe City initiated efforts to increase minority representa\ntion in the New Haven Fire Department (Department).\nThose litigation-induced efforts produced some positive\nchange. New Haven\u2019s population includes a greater pro\nportion of minorities today than it did in the 1970\u2019s:\nNearly 40 percent of the City\u2019s residents are African\n4                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAmerican and more than 20 percent are Hispanic. Among\nentry-level firefighters, minorities are still underrepre\nsented, but not starkly so. As of 2003, African-Americans\nand Hispanics constituted 30 percent and 16 percent of the\nCity\u2019s firefighters, respectively. In supervisory positions,\nhowever, significant disparities remain. Overall, the\nsenior officer ranks (captain and higher) are nine percent\nAfrican-American and nine percent Hispanic. Only one of\nthe Department\u2019s 21 fire captains is African-American.\nSee App. in No. 06\u20134996\u2013cv (CA2), p. A1588 (hereinafter\nCA2 App.). It is against this backdrop of entrenched\ninequality that the promotion process at issue in this\nlitigation should be assessed.\n                             B\n   By order of its charter, New Haven must use competi\ntive examinations to fill vacancies in fire officer and other\ncivil-service positions. Such examinations, the City\u2019s civil\nservice rules specify, \u201cshall be practical in nature, shall\nrelate to matters which fairly measure the relative fitness\nand capacity of the applicants to discharge the duties of\nthe position which they seek, and shall take into account\ncharacter, training, experience, physical and mental fit\nness.\u201d Id., at A331. The City may choose among a variety\nof testing methods, including written and oral exams and\n\u201c[p]erformance tests to demonstrate skill and ability in\nperforming actual work.\u201d Id., at A332.\n   New Haven, the record indicates, did not closely con\nsider what sort of \u201cpractical\u201d examination would \u201cfairly\nmeasure the relative fitness and capacity of the applicants\nto discharge the duties\u201d of a fire officer. Instead, the City\nsimply adhered to the testing regime outlined in its two\ndecades-old contract with the local firefighters\u2019 union: a\nwritten exam, which would account for 60 percent of an\napplicant\u2019s total score, and an oral exam, which would\naccount for the remaining 40 percent. Id., at A1045. In\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsoliciting bids from exam development companies, New\nHaven made clear that it would entertain only \u201cproposals\nthat include a written component that will be weighted at\n60%, and an oral component that will be weighted at\n40%.\u201d Id., at A342. Chad Legel, a representative of the\nwinning bidder, Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc.\n(IOS), testified during his deposition that the City never\nasked whether alternative methods might better measure\nthe qualities of a successful fire officer, including leader\nship skills and command presence. See id., at A522 (\u201cI\nwas under contract and had responsibility only to create\nthe oral interview and the written exam.\u201d).\n   Pursuant to New Haven\u2019s specifications, IOS developed\nand administered the oral and written exams. The results\nshowed significant racial disparities. On the lieutenant\nexam, the pass rate for African-American candidates was\nabout one-half the rate for Caucasian candidates; the pass\nrate for Hispanic candidates was even lower. On the\ncaptain exam, both African-American and Hispanic candi\ndates passed at about half the rate of their Caucasian\ncounterparts. See App. 225\u2013226. More striking still,\nalthough nearly half of the 77 lieutenant candidates were\nAfrican-American or Hispanic, none would have been\neligible for promotion to the eight positions then vacant.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n13th; the top Hispanic candidate was 26th. As for the\nseven then-vacant captain positions, two Hispanic candi\ndates would have been eligible, but no African-Americans.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n15th. See id., at 218\u2013219.\n   These stark disparities, the Court acknowledges, suf\nficed to state a prima facie case under Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-impact provision. See ante, at 27 (\u201cThe pass rates of\nminorities . . . f[e]ll well below the 80-percent standard set\nby the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC)] to implement the disparate-impact provision of\n6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nTitle VII.\u201d). New Haven thus had cause for concern about\nthe prospect of Title VII litigation and liability. City\nofficials referred the matter to the New Haven Civil Ser\nvice Board (CSB), the entity responsible for certifying the\nresults of employment exams.\n   Between January and March 2004, the CSB held five\npublic meetings to consider the proper course. At the first\nmeeting, New Haven\u2019s Corporation Counsel, Thomas Ude,\ndescribed the legal standard governing Title VII disparate\nimpact claims. Statistical imbalances alone, Ude correctly\nrecognized, do not give rise to liability. Instead, presented\nwith a disparity, an employer \u201chas the opportunity and the\nburden of proving that the test is job-related and consis\ntent with business necessity.\u201d CA2 App. A724. A Title VII\nplaintiff may attempt to rebut an employer\u2019s showing of\njob-relatedness and necessity by identifying alternative\nselection methods that would have been at least as valid\nbut with \u201cless of an adverse or disparate or discriminatory\neffect.\u201d Ibid. See also id., at A738. Accordingly, the CSB\nCommissioners understood, their principal task was to\ndecide whether they were confident about the reliability of\nthe exams: Had the exams fairly measured the qualities of\na successful fire officer despite their disparate results?\nMight an alternative examination process have identified\nthe most qualified candidates without creating such sig\nnificant racial imbalances?\n   Seeking a range of input on these questions, the CSB\nheard from test takers, the test designer, subject-matter\nexperts, City officials, union leaders, and community\nmembers. Several candidates for promotion, who did not\nyet know their exam results, spoke at the CSB\u2019s first two\nmeetings. Some candidates favored certification. The\nexams, they emphasized, had closely tracked the assigned\nstudy materials. Having invested substantial time and\nmoney to prepare themselves for the test, they felt it\nwould be unfair to scrap the results. See, e.g., id., at\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nA772\u2013A773, A785\u2013A789.\n   Other firefighters had a different view. A number of the\nexam questions, they pointed out, were not germane to\nNew Haven\u2019s practices and procedures. See, e.g., id., at\nA774\u2013A784. At least two candidates opposed to certifica\ntion noted unequal access to study materials. Some indi\nviduals, they asserted, had the necessary books even\nbefore the syllabus was issued. Others had to invest\nsubstantial sums to purchase the materials and \u201cwait a\nmonth and a half for some of the books because they were\non back-order.\u201d Id., at A858. These disparities, it was\nsuggested, fell at least in part along racial lines. While\nmany Caucasian applicants could obtain materials and\nassistance from relatives in the fire service, the over\nwhelming majority of minority applicants were \u201cfirst\ngeneration firefighters\u201d without such support networks.\nSee id., at A857\u2013A861, A886\u2013A887.\n   A representative of the Northeast Region of the Interna\ntional Association of Black Professional Firefighters,\nDonald Day, also spoke at the second meeting. Statistical\ndisparities, he told the CSB, had been present in the\nDepartment\u2019s previous promotional exams. On earlier\ntests, however, a few minority candidates had fared well\nenough to earn promotions. Id., at A828. See also App.\n218\u2013219. Day contrasted New Haven\u2019s experience with\nthat of nearby Bridgeport, where minority firefighters held\none-third of lieutenant and captain positions. Bridgeport,\nDay observed, had once used a testing process similar to\nNew Haven\u2019s, with a written exam accounting for 70\npercent of an applicant\u2019s score, an oral exam for 25 per\ncent, and seniority for the remaining five percent. CA2\nApp. A830. Bridgeport recognized, however, that the oral\ncomponent, more so than the written component, ad\ndressed the sort of \u201creal-life scenarios\u201d fire officers encoun\nter on the job. Id., at A832. Accordingly, that city\n\u201cchanged the relative weights\u201d to give primacy to the oral\n8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nexam. Ibid. Since that time, Day reported, Bridgeport\nhad seen minorities \u201cfairly represented\u201d in its exam re\nsults. Ibid.\n   The CSB\u2019s third meeting featured IOS representative\nLegel, the leader of the team that had designed and ad\nministered the exams for New Haven. Several City offi\ncials also participated in the discussion. Legel described\nthe exam development process in detail. The City, he\nrecounted, had set the \u201cparameters\u201d for the exams, specifi\ncally, the requirement of written and oral components\nwith a 60/40 weighting. Id., at A923, A974. For security\nreasons, Department officials had not been permitted to\ncheck the content of the questions prior to their admini\nstration. Instead, IOS retained a senior fire officer from\nGeorgia to review the exams \u201cfor content and fidelity to\nthe source material.\u201d Id., at A936. Legel defended the\nexams as \u201cfacially neutral,\u201d and stated that he \u201cwould\nstand by the[ir] validity.\u201d Id., at A962. City officials did\nnot dispute the neutrality of IOS\u2019s work. But, they cau\ntioned, even if individual exam questions had no intrinsic\nbias, the selection process as a whole may nevertheless\nhave been deficient. The officials urged the CSB to consult\nwith experts about the \u201clarger picture.\u201d Id., at A1012.\n   At its fourth meeting, CSB solicited the views of three\nindividuals with testing-related expertise. Dr. Christo\npher Hornick, an industrial/organizational psychology\nconsultant with 25 years\u2019 experience with police and fire\nfighter testing, described the exam results as having\n\u201crelatively high adverse impact.\u201d Id., at A1028. Most of\nthe tests he had developed, Hornick stated, exhibited\n\u201csignificantly and dramatically less adverse impact.\u201d Id.,\nat A1029. Hornick downplayed the notion of \u201cfacial neu\ntrality.\u201d It was more important, he advised the CSB, to\nconsider \u201cthe broader issue of how your procedures and\nyour rules and the types of tests that you are using are\ncontributing to the adverse impact.\u201d Id., at A1038.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n    Specifically, Hornick questioned New Haven\u2019s union\nprompted 60/40 written/oral examination structure, noting\nthe availability of \u201cdifferent types of testing procedures\nthat are much more valid in terms of identifying the best\npotential supervisors in [the] fire department.\u201d Id., at\nA1032. He suggested, for example, \u201can assessment center\nprocess, which is essentially an opportunity for candidates\n. . . to demonstrate how they would address a particular\nproblem as opposed to just verbally saying it or identifying\nthe correct option on a written test.\u201d Id., at A1039\u2013A1040.\nSuch selection processes, Hornick said, better \u201cidentif[y]\nthe best possible people\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate dramatically\nless adverse impacts.\u201d Ibid. Hornick added:\n    \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to at least 10,000, maybe 15,000 fire\n    fighters in group settings in my consulting practice\n    and I have never one time ever had anyone in the fire\n    service say to me, \u2018Well, the person who answers\u2014\n    gets the highest score on a written job knowledge,\n    multiple-guess test makes the best company officer.\u2019\n    We know that it\u2019s not as valid as other procedures\n    that exist.\u201d Id., at A1033.\nSee also id., at A1042\u2013A1043 (\u201cI think a person\u2019s leader\nship skills, their command presence, their interpersonal\nskills, their management skills, their tactical skills could\nhave been identified and evaluated in a much more appro\npriate way.\u201d).\n   Hornick described the written test itself as \u201creasonably\ngood,\u201d id., at A1041, but he criticized the decision not to\nallow Department officials to check the content. According\nto Hornick, this \u201cinevitably\u201d led to \u201ctest[ing] for processes\nand procedures that don\u2019t necessarily match up into the\ndepartment.\u201d Id., at A1034\u2013A1035. He preferred \u201cexperts\nfrom within the department who have signed confidential\nity agreements . . . to make sure that the terminology and\nequipment that\u2019s being identified from standardized read\n10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ning sources apply to the department.\u201d Id., at A1035.\n   Asked whether he thought the City should certify the\nresults, Hornick hedged: \u201cThere is adverse impact in the\ntest. That will be identified in any proceeding that you\nhave. You will have industrial psychology experts, if it\ngoes to court, on both sides. And it will not be a pretty or\ncomfortable position for anyone to be in.\u201d Id., at A1040\u2013\nA1041. Perhaps, he suggested, New Haven might certify\nthe results but immediately begin exploring \u201calternative\nways to deal with these issues\u201d in the future. Id., at\nA1041.\n   The two other witnesses made relatively brief appear\nances. Vincent Lewis, a specialist with the Department of\nHomeland Security and former fire officer in Michigan,\nbelieved the exams had generally tested relevant material,\nalthough he noted a relatively heavy emphasis on ques\ntions pertaining to being an \u201capparatus driver.\u201d He sug\ngested that this may have disadvantaged test takers \u201cwho\nhad not had the training or had not had an opportunity to\ndrive the apparatus.\u201d Id., at A1051. He also urged the\nCSB to consider whether candidates had, in fact, enjoyed\nequal access to the study materials. Ibid. Cf. supra, at 7.\n   Janet Helms, a professor of counseling psychology at\nBoston College, observed that two-thirds of the incumbent\nfire officers who submitted job analyses to IOS during the\nexam design phase were Caucasian. Members of different\nracial groups, Helms told the CSB, sometimes do their jobs\nin different ways, \u201coften because the experiences that are\nopen to white male firefighters are not open to members of\nthese other under-represented groups.\u201d CA2 App. A1063\u2013\nA1064. The heavy reliance on job analyses from white\nfirefighters, she suggested, may thus have introduced an\nelement of bias. Id., at A1063.\n   The CSB\u2019s fifth and final meeting began with state\nments from City officials recommending against certifica\ntion. Ude, New Haven\u2019s counsel, repeated the applicable\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Where a\n    procedure demonstrates adverse impact, you look to\n    how closely it is related to the job that you\u2019re looking\n    to fill and you also look at whether there are other\n    ways to test for those qualities, those traits, those po\n    sitions that are equally valid with less adverse im\n    pact.\u201d Id., at A1100\u2013A1101.\nNew Haven, Ude and other officials asserted, would be\nvulnerable to Title VII liability under this standard. Even\nif the exams were \u201cfacially neutral,\u201d significant doubts had\nbeen raised about whether they properly assessed the key\nattributes of a successful fire officer. Id., at A1103. See\nalso id., at A1125 (\u201cUpon close reading of the exams, the\nquestions themselves would appear to test a candidate\u2019s\nability to memorize textbooks but not necessarily to iden\ntify solutions to real problems on the fire ground.\u201d). More\nover, City officials reminded the CSB, Hornick and others\nhad identified better, less discriminatory selection meth\nods\u2013such as assessment centers or exams with a more\nheavily weighted oral component. Id., at A1108\u2013A1109,\nA1129\u2013A1130.\n   After giving members of the public a final chance to\nweigh in, the CSB voted on certification, dividing 2 to 2.\nBy rule, the result was noncertification. Voting no, Com\nmissioner Webber stated, \u201cI originally was going to vote to\ncertify. . . . But I\u2019ve heard enough testimony here to give\nme great doubts about the test itself and . . . some of the\nprocedures. And I believe we can do better.\u201d Id., at\nA1157. Commissioner Tirado likewise concluded that the\n\u201cflawed\u201d testing process counseled against certification.\nId., at A1158. Chairman Segaloff and Commissioner\nCaplan voted to certify. According to Segaloff, the testi\nmony had not \u201ccompelled [him] to say this exam was not\n12                  RICCI v.

Id., at\nA1150\u2013A1154.\n                                C\n   Following the CSB\u2019s vote, petitioners\u201417 white fire\nfighters and one Hispanic firefighter, all of whom had high\nmarks on the exams\u2014filed suit in the United States Dis\ntrict Court for the District of Connecticut. They named as\ndefendants\u2014respondents here\u2014the City, several City\nofficials, a local political activist, and the two CSB mem\nbers who voted against certifying the results. By opposing\ncertification, petitioners alleged, respondents had dis\ncriminated against them in violation of Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-treatment provision and the Fourteenth Amend\nment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. The decision not to\ncertify, respondents answered, was a lawful effort to com\nply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provision and thus\ncould not have run afoul of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of dispa\nrate treatment. Characterizing respondents\u2019 stated ra\ntionale as a mere pretext, petitioners insisted that New\nHaven would have had a solid defense to any disparate\nimpact suit.\n   In a decision summarily affirmed by the Court of Ap\npeals, the District Court granted summary judgment for\nrespondents. 554 F.

Supp. 2d, at 158.\nHad New Haven gone forward with certification and been\nsued by aggrieved minority test takers, the City would\nhave been forced to defend tests that were presumptively\ninvalid. And, as the CSB testimony of Hornick and others\nindicated, overcoming that presumption would have been\nno easy task. Id., at 153\u2013156. Given Title VII\u2019s preference\nfor voluntary compliance, the court held, New Haven could\nlawfully discard the disputed exams even if the City had\nnot definitively \u201cpinpoint[ed]\u201d the source of the disparity\nand \u201cha[d] not yet formulated a better selection method.\u201d\nId., at 156.\n  Respondents were no doubt conscious of race during\ntheir decisionmaking process, the court acknowledged, but\nthis did not mean they had engaged in racially disparate\ntreatment. The conclusion they had reached and the\naction thereupon taken were race-neutral in this sense:\n\u201c[A]ll the test results were discarded, no one was pro\nmoted, and firefighters of every race will have to partici\npate in another selection process to be considered for\npromotion.\u201d Id., at 158. New Haven\u2019s action, which gave\nno individual a preference, \u201cwas \u2018simply not analogous to a\nquota system or a minority set-aside where candidates, on\nthe basis of their race, are not treated uniformly.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n157 (quoting Hayden, 180 F. 3d, at 50). For these and\nother reasons, the court also rejected petitioners\u2019 equal\nprotection claim.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  Title VII became effective in July 1965. Employers\nresponded to the law by eliminating rules and practices\nthat explicitly barred racial minorities from \u201cwhite\u201d jobs.\nBut removing overtly race-based job classifications did not\nusher in genuinely equal opportunity.

Congress, the\nlandmark decision recognized, aimed beyond \u201cdisparate\ntreatment\u201d; it targeted \u201cdisparate impact\u201d as well. Title\nVII\u2019s original text, it was plain to the Court, \u201cproscribe[d]\nnot only overt discrimination but also practices that are\nfair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\u201d Id., at 431.2\nOnly by ignoring Griggs could one maintain that inten\ntionally disparate treatment alone was Title VII\u2019s \u201corigi\nnal, foundational prohibition,\u201d and disparate impact a\nmere afterthought.

See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S.\n792, 800 (1973).\n   Yet the Court today sets at odds the statute\u2019s core direc\ntives. When an employer changes an employment practice\nin an effort to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact\nprovision, the Court reasons, it acts \u201cbecause of race\u201d\u2014\nsomething Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment provision, see\n\u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), generally forbids.

Here, Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment\nand disparate-impact proscriptions must be read as\ncomplementary.\n  In codifying the Griggs and Albemarle instructions,\nCongress declared unambiguously that selection criteria\noperating to the disadvantage of minority group members\ncan be retained only if justified by business necessity.5 In\nkeeping with Congress\u2019 design, employers who reject such\ncriteria due to reasonable doubts about their reliability\ncan hardly be held to have engaged in discrimination\n\u201cbecause of\u201d race. A reasonable endeavor to comply with\nthe law and to ensure that qualified candidates of all races\nhave a fair opportunity to compete is simply not what\nCongress meant to interdict. I would therefore hold that\nan employer who jettisons a selection device when its\ndisproportionate racial impact becomes apparent does not\nviolate Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment bar automatically\nor at all, subject to this key condition: The employer must\nhave good cause to believe the device would not withstand\nexamination for business necessity.

See, e.g., Albe\u00ad\nmarle, 422 U. S., at 431; Griggs, 401 U. S., at 434. Yet the\nCourt today does not so much as mention EEOC\u2019s counsel.\n   Our precedents defining the contours of Title VII\u2019s\ndisparate-treatment prohibition further confirm the ab\nsence of any intra-statutory discord. In Johnson v. Trans\u00ad\nportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616 (1987),\nwe upheld a municipal employer\u2019s voluntary affirmative\naction plan against a disparate-treatment challenge.\nPursuant to the plan, the employer selected a woman for a\nroad-dispatcher position, a job category traditionally\nregarded as \u201cmale.\u201d A male applicant who had a slightly\nhigher interview score brought suit under Title VII. This\nCourt rejected his claim and approved the plan, which\nallowed consideration of gender as \u201cone of numerous fac\ntors.\u201d Id., at 638. Such consideration, we said, is \u201cfully\nconsistent with Title VII\u201d because plans of that order can\naid \u201cin eliminating the vestiges of discrimination in the\nworkplace.\u201d Id., at 642.\n   This litigation does not involve affirmative action. But\nif the voluntary affirmative action at issue in Johnson\ndoes not discriminate within the meaning of Title VII,\nneither does an employer\u2019s reasonable effort to comply\nwith Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provision by refrain-\ning from action of doubtful consistency with business\nnecessity.\n                            C\n  To \u201creconcile\u201d the supposed \u201cconflict\u201d between disparate\ntreatment and disparate impact, the Court offers an enig\nmatic standard. Ante, at 20. Employers may attempt to\ncomply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provision, the\nCourt declares, only where there is a \u201cstrong basis in\nevidence\u201d documenting the necessity of their action.

One is left to\nwonder what cases would meet the standard and why the\nCourt is so sure this case does not.\n                              1\n   In construing Title VII, I note preliminarily, equal\nprotection doctrine is of limited utility. The Equal Protec\ntion Clause, this Court has held, prohibits only intentional\ndiscrimination; it does not have a disparate-impact com\nponent. See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney,\n442 U. S. 256, 272 (1979); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.\n229, 239 (1976). Title VII, in contrast, aims to eliminate\nall forms of employment discrimination, unintentional as\nwell as deliberate. Until today, cf. ante, at 25; ante, p. 1\n(SCALIA, J., concurring), this Court has never questioned\nthe constitutionality of the disparate-impact component of\nTitle VII, and for good reason. By instructing employers\nto avoid needlessly exclusionary selection processes, Title\nVII\u2019s disparate-impact provision calls for a \u201crace-neutral\nmeans to increase minority . . . participation\u201d\u2014something\nthis Court\u2019s equal protection precedents also encourage.\nSee Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 238\n(1995) (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.\n469, 507 (1989)). \u201cThe very radicalism of holding dispa\nrate impact doctrine unconstitutional as a matter of equal\nprotection,\u201d moreover, \u201csuggests that only a very uncom\npromising court would issue such a decision.\u201d Primus,\nEqual Protection and Disparate Impact: Round Three, 117\nHarv.

An em\nployer\u2019s effort to avoid Title VII liability by repudiating a\nsuspect selection method scarcely resembles those cases.\nRace was not merely a relevant consideration in Wygant\nand Croson; it was the decisive factor. Observance of Title\nVII\u2019s disparate-impact provision, in contrast, calls for no\nracial preference, absolute or otherwise. The very purpose\nof the provision is to ensure that individuals are hired and\npromoted based on qualifications manifestly necessary to\nsuccessful performance of the job in question, qualifica\ntions that do not screen out members of any race.6\n                             2\n  The Court\u2019s decision in this litigation underplays a\ndominant Title VII theme. This Court has repeatedly\nemphasized that the statute \u201cshould not be read to\nthwart\u201d efforts at voluntary compliance. Johnson, 480\nU. S., at 630. Such compliance, we have explained, is \u201cthe\npreferred means of achieving [Title VII\u2019s] objectives.\u201d\nFirefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 515 (1986). See\nalso Kolstad v.

The strong-basis-in-evidence standard,\nhowever, as barely described in general, and cavalierly\napplied in this case, makes voluntary compliance a haz\nardous venture.\n   As a result of today\u2019s decision, an employer who discards\na dubious selection process can anticipate costly disparate\ntreatment litigation in which its chances for success\u2014even\nfor surviving a summary-judgment motion\u2014are highly\nproblematic. Concern about exposure to disparate-impact\nliability, however well grounded, is insufficient to insulate\nan employer from attack. Instead, the employer must\nmake a \u201cstrong\u201d showing that (1) its selection method was\n\u201cnot job related and consistent with business necessity,\u201d or\n(2) that it refused to adopt \u201can equally valid, less\ndiscriminatory alternative.\u201d Ante, at 28. It is hard to see\nhow these requirements differ from demanding that an\nemployer establish \u201ca provable, actual violation\u201d against\nitself. Cf. ante, at 24. There is indeed a sharp conflict\nhere, but it is not the false one the Court describes be\ntween Title VII\u2019s core provisions. It is, instead, the discor\ndance of the Court\u2019s opinion with the voluntary compli\nance ideal. Cf. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 290 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cThe\nimposition of a requirement that public employers make\nfindings that they have engaged in illegal discrimina-\ntion before they [act] would severely undermine public\nemployers\u2019 incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights\nobligations.\u201d).7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Notably,prior decisions applying a strong-basis-in-evidence stan\ndard have not imposed a burden as heavy as the one the Court imposes\ntoday.

This\nrationale puts the cart before the horse. The legitimacy of\nan employee\u2019s expectation depends on the legitimacy of the\nselection method. If an employer reasonably concludes\nthat an exam fails to identify the most qualified individu\nals and needlessly shuts out a segment of the applicant\npool, Title VII surely does not compel the employer to hire\nor promote based on the test, however unreliable it may\nbe. Indeed, the statute\u2019s prime objective is to prevent\nexclusionary practices from \u201coperat[ing] to \u2018freeze\u2019 the\nstatus quo.\u201d Griggs, 401 U. S., at 430.\n  Second, the Court suggests, anything less than a strong\nbasis-in-evidence standard risks creating \u201ca de facto quota\nsystem, in which . . . an employer could discard test re\nsults . . . with the intent of obtaining the employer\u2019s pre\nferred racial balance.\u201d Ante, at 22. Under a reasonable\nness standard, however, an employer could not cast aside\na selection method based on a statistical disparity alone.8\nThe employer must have good cause to believe that the\nmethod screens out qualified applicants and would be\ndifficult to justify as grounded in business necessity.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntions\u201d for liability are present. Bush v. Vera, 517 U.

See also ante, at 20, 27\u201328. But as the part of the story the\nCourt leaves out, see supra, at 2\u201312, so plainly shows\u2014the long history\nof rank discrimination against African-Americans in the firefighting\nprofession, the multiple flaws in New Haven\u2019s test for promotions\u2014\n\u201csole reliance\u201d on statistics certainly is not descriptive of the CSB\u2019s\ndecision.\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

When this Court formulates a\nnew legal rule, the ordinary course is to remand and allow\nthe lower courts to apply the rule in the first instance.\nSee, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515 (2005);\nPullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 291 (1982). I\nsee no good reason why the Court fails to follow that\ncourse in this case. Indeed, the sole basis for the Court\u2019s\nperemptory ruling is the demonstrably false pretension\nthat respondents showed \u201cnothing more\u201d than \u201ca signifi\ncant statistical disparity.\u201d Ante, at 27\u201328; see supra, at\n24, n. 8. 9\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The  Court\u2019s refusal to remand for further proceedings also deprives\nrespondents of an opportunity to invoke 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u201312(b) as a\nshield to liability. Section 2000e\u201312(b) provides:\n\u201cIn any action or proceeding based on any alleged unlawful employment\npractice, no person shall be subject to any liability or punishment for or\non account of (1) the commission by such person of an unlawful em\nployment practice if he pleads and proves that the act or omission\ncomplained of was in good faith, in conformity with, and in reliance on\nany written interpretation or opinion of the [EEOC] . . . . Such a\ndefense, if established, shall be a bar to the action or proceeding,\nnotwithstanding that (A) after such act or omission, such interpretation\nor opinion is modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial author\nity to be invalid or of no legal effect . . . .\u201d\nSpecifically, given the chance, respondents might have called attention\nto the EEOC guidelines set out in 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a71608.3 and 1608.4 (2008).\nThe guidelines recognize that employers may \u201ctake affirmative action\nbased on an analysis which reveals facts constituting actual or poten\ntial adverse impact.\u201d \u00a71608.3(a). If \u201caffirmative action\u201d is in order, so\nis the lesser step of discarding a dubious selection device.\n26                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   Applying what I view as the proper standard to the\nrecord thus far made, I would hold that New Haven had\nample cause to believe its selection process was flawed and\nnot justified by business necessity. Judged by that stan\ndard, petitioners have not shown that New Haven\u2019s failure\nto certify the exam results violated Title VII\u2019s disparate\ntreatment provision.10\n   The City, all agree, \u201cwas faced with a prima facie case of\ndisparate-impact liability,\u201d ante, at 27: The pass rate for\nminority candidates was half the rate for nonminority\ncandidates, and virtually no minority candidates would\nhave been eligible for promotion had the exam results\nbeen certified. Alerted to this stark disparity, the CSB\nheard expert and lay testimony, presented at public hear\nings, in an endeavor to ascertain whether the exams were\nfair and consistent with business necessity. Its investiga\ntion revealed grave cause for concern about the exam\nprocess itself and the City\u2019s failure to consider alternative\nselection devices.\n   Chief among the City\u2019s problems was the very nature of\nthe tests for promotion. In choosing to use written and\noral exams with a 60/40 weighting, the City simply ad\nhered to the union\u2019s preference and apparently gave no\nconsideration to whether the weighting was likely to\nidentify the most qualified fire-officer candidates.11 There\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The lower courts focused on respondents\u2019 \u201cintent\u201d rather than on\n\nwhether respondents in fact had good cause to act. See 554 F. Supp. 2d\n142, 157 (Conn. 2006). Ordinarily, a remand for fresh consideration\nwould be in order. But the Court has seen fit to preclude further\nproceedings. I therefore explain why, if final adjudication by this Court\nis indeed appropriate, New Haven should be the prevailing party.\n   11 This alone would have posed a substantial problem for New Haven\n\nin a disparate-impact suit, particularly in light of the disparate results\nthe City\u2019s scheme had produced in the past. See supra, at 7. Under the\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

Successful fire\nofficers, the City\u2019s description of the position makes clear,\nmust have the \u201c[a]bility to lead personnel effectively,\nmaintain discipline, promote harmony, exercise sound\njudgment, and cooperate with other officials.\u201d CA2 App.\nA432. These qualities are not well measured by written\ntests. Testifying before the CSB, Christopher Hornick, an\nexam-design expert with more than two decades of rele\nvant experience, was emphatic on this point: Leadership\nskills, command presence, and the like \u201ccould have been\nidentified and evaluated in a much more appropriate\nway.\u201d Id., at A1042\u2013A1043.\n   Hornick\u2019s commonsense observation is mirrored in case\nlaw and in Title VII\u2019s administrative guidelines. Courts\nhave long criticized written firefighter promotion exams\nfor being \u201cmore probative of the test-taker\u2019s ability to\nrecall what a particular text stated on a given topic than\nof his firefighting or supervisory knowledge and abilities.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nUniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (Uniform\nGuidelines), employers must conduct \u201can investigation of suitable\nalternative selection procedures.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a71607.3(B).

Although compre\nhensive statistics are scarce, a 1996 study found that\nnearly two-thirds of surveyed municipalities used assess\nment centers (\u201csimulations of the real world of work\u201d) as\npart of their promotion processes. P. Lowry, A Survey of\nthe Assessment Center Process in the Public Sector, 25\nPublic Personnel Management 307, 315 (1996). That\nfigure represented a marked increase over the previous\ndecade, see ibid., so the percentage today may well be even\nhigher. Among municipalities still relying in part on\nwritten exams, the median weight assigned to them was\n30 percent\u2014half the weight given to New Haven\u2019s written\nexam. Id., at 309.\n   Testimony before the CSB indicated that these alterna\ntive methods were both more reliable and notably less\ndiscriminatory in operation. According to Donald Day of\nthe International Association of Black Professional Fire\nfighters, nearby Bridgeport saw less skewed results after\nswitching to a selection process that placed primary\nweight on an oral exam.

The Court\u2019s specific argu\nments are unavailing.       First, the Court suggests, changing the\noral/written weighting may have violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition on\naltering test scores. Ante, at 31. No one is arguing, however, that the\nresults of the exams given should have been altered. Rather, the\nargument is that the City could have availed itself of a better option\nwhen it initially decided what selection process to use.

A\ndifference of one or two points on a multiple-choice exam should not be\ndecisive of an applicant\u2019s promotion chances if that difference bears\nlittle relationship to the applicant\u2019s qualifications for the job. Relat\nedly, it appears that the line between a passing and failing score did\nnot accurately differentiate between qualified and unqualified candi\ndates. A number of fire-officer promotional exams have been invali\ndated on these bases. See, e.g., Guardians Assn., 630 F. 2d, at 105\n(\u201cWhen a cutoff score unrelated to job performance produces disparate\nracial results, Title VII is violated.\u201d); Vulcan Pioneers, Inc. v. New\nJersey Dept. of Civil Serv., 625 F. Supp. 527, 538 (NJ 1985) (\u201c[T]he tests\nhere at issue are not appropriate for ranking candidates.\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

A reasonable jury, he maintains, could\nhave found that respondents were not actually motivated\nby concern about disparate-impact litigation, but instead\nsought only \u201cto placate a politically important [African-\nAmerican] constituency.\u201d Ante, at 3. As earlier noted, I\nwould not oppose a remand for further proceedings fair to\nboth sides. See supra, at 26, n. 10. It is the Court that\nhas chosen to short-circuit this litigation based on its\npretension that the City has shown, and can show, noth\ning more than a statistical disparity. See supra, at 24,\nn. 8, 25. JUSTICE ALITO compounds the Court\u2019s error.\n  Offering a truncated synopsis of the many hours of\ndeliberations undertaken by the CSB, JUSTICE ALITO finds\nevidence suggesting that respondents\u2019 stated desire to\ncomply with Title VII was insincere, a mere \u201cpretext\u201d for\ndiscrimination against white firefighters. Ante, at 2\u20133. In\nsupport of his assertion, JUSTICE ALITO recounts at length\nthe alleged machinations of Rev. Boise Kimber (a local\npolitical activist), Mayor John DeStefano, and certain\nmembers of the mayor\u2019s staff. See ante, at 3\u201310.\n  Most of the allegations JUSTICE ALITO repeats are\ndrawn from petitioners\u2019 statement of facts they deem\nundisputed, a statement displaying an adversarial zeal\nnot uncommonly found in such presentations.17 What\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Some  of petitioners\u2019 so-called facts find little support in the record,\nand many others can scarcely be deemed material. Petitioners allege,\nfor example, that City officials prevented New Haven\u2019s fire chief and\nassistant chief from sharing their views about the exams with the CSB.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 228a. None of the materials\npetitioners cite, however, \u201csuggests\u201d that this proposition is accurate.\nCf. ante, at 5. In her deposition testimony, City official Karen Dubois-\nWalton specifically denied that she or her colleagues directed the chief\n34                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncannot credibly be denied, however, is that the decision\nagainst certification of the exams was made neither by\nKimber nor by the mayor and his staff. The relevant\ndecision was made by the CSB, an unelected, politically\ninsulated body. It is striking that JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concur\nrence says hardly a word about the CSB itself, perhaps\nbecause there is scant evidence that its motivation was\nanything other than to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact provision. Notably, petitioners did not even seek to\ntake depositions of the two commissioners who voted\nagainst certification. Both submitted uncontested affida\nvits declaring unequivocally that their votes were \u201cbased\nsolely on [their] good faith belief that certification\u201d would\nhave discriminated against minority candidates in viola\ntion of federal law. CA2 App. A1605, A1611.\n   JUSTICE ALITO discounts these sworn statements, sug\ngesting that the CSB\u2019s deliberations were tainted by the\npreferences of Kimber and City officials, whether or not\nthe CSB itself was aware of the taint. Kimber and City\nofficials, JUSTICE ALITO speculates, decided early on to\noppose certification and then \u201cengineered\u201d a skewed pres\nentation to the CSB to achieve their preferred outcome.\nAnte, at 12.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nand assistant chief not to appear. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, \n\np. 850a. Moreover, contrary to the insinuations of petitioners and\nJUSTICE ALITO, the statements made by City officials before the CSB did\nnot emphasize allegations of cheating by test takers. Cf. ante, at 7\u20138.\nIn her deposition, Dubois-Walton acknowledged sharing the cheating\nallegations not with the CSB, but with a different City commission.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 837a. JUSTICE ALITO also\nreports that the City\u2019s attorney advised the mayor\u2019s team that the way\nto convince the CSB not to certify was \u201cto focus on something other\nthan \u2018a big discussion re: adverse impact\u2019 law.\u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 458a). This is a misleading abbre\nviation of the attorney\u2019s advice. Focusing on the exams\u2019 defects and on\ndisparate-impact law is precisely what he recommended.

The CSB, the record reveals,\ndesigned and conducted an inclusive decisionmaking\nprocess, in which it heard from numerous individuals on\nboth sides of the certification question. See, e.g., CA2 App.\nA1090. Kimber and others no doubt used strong words to\nurge the CSB not to certify the exam results, but the CSB\nreceived \u201cpressure\u201d from supporters of certification as well\nas opponents. Cf. ante, at 6. Petitioners, for example,\nengaged counsel to speak on their behalf before the CSB.\nTheir counsel did not mince words: \u201c[I]f you discard these\nresults,\u201d she warned, \u201cyou will get sued. You will force the\ntaxpayers of the city of New Haven into protracted litiga\ntion.\u201d CA2 App. A816. See also id., at A788.\n   The local firefighters union\u2014an organization required\nby law to represent all the City\u2019s firefighters\u2014was simi\nlarly outspoken in favor of certification. Discarding the\ntest results, the union\u2019s president told the CSB, would be\n\u201ctotally ridiculous.\u201d Id., at A806. He insisted, inaccu\nrately, that the City was not at risk of disparate-impact\nliability because the exams were administered pursuant to\n\u201ca collective bargaining agreement.\u201d Id., at A1137. Cf.\nsupra, at 26\u201327, n. 11. Never mentioned by JUSTICE\nALITO in his attempt to show testing expert Christopher\nHornick\u2019s alliance with the City, ante, at 8\u20139, the CSB\nsolicited Hornick\u2019s testimony at the union\u2019s suggestion, not\nthe City\u2019s. CA2 App. A1128. Hornick\u2019s cogent testimony\nraised substantial doubts about the exams\u2019 reliability. See\nsupra, at 8\u201310.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 City officials, JUSTICE ALITO reports, sent Hornick newspaper ac\n\ncounts and other material about the exams prior to his testimony.\nAnte, at 8. Some of these materials, JUSTICE ALITO intimates, may have\ngiven Hornick an inaccurate portrait of the exams. But Hornick\u2019s\ntestimony before the CSB, viewed in full, indicates that Hornick had an\naccurate understanding of the exam process. Much of Hornick\u2019s analy\nsis focused on the 60/40 weighting of the written and oral exams,\n36                      RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  There is scant cause to suspect that maneuvering or\noverheated rhetoric, from either side, prevented the CSB\nfrom evenhandedly assessing the reliability of the exams\nand rendering an independent, good-faith decision on\ncertification. JUSTICE ALITO acknowledges that the CSB\nhad little patience for Kimber\u2019s antics. Ante, at 6\u20137.19 As\nto petitioners, Chairman Segaloff\u2014who voted to certify\nthe exam results\u2014dismissed the threats made by their\ncounsel as unhelpful and needlessly \u201cinflammatory.\u201d CA2\nApp. A821. Regarding the views expressed by City offi\ncials, the CSB made clear that they were entitled to no\nspecial weight. Id., at A1080.20\n  In any event, JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s analysis contains a more\nfundamental flaw: It equates political considerations with\nunlawful discrimination. As JUSTICE ALITO sees it, if the\nmayor and his staff were motivated by their desire \u201cto\nplacate a . . . racial constituency,\u201d ante, at 3, then they\nengaged in unlawful discrimination against petitioners.\nBut JUSTICE ALITO fails to ask a vital question: \u201c[P]lacate\u201d\nhow? That political officials would have politics in mind is\nhardly extraordinary, and there are many ways in which a\npolitician can attempt to win over a constituency\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsomething that neither the Court nor the concurrences even attempt to\ndefend. It is, moreover, entirely misleading to say that the City later\nhired union-proposed Hornick as a \u201crewar[d]\u201d for his testimony. Cf.\nAnte, at 9.\n   19 To be clear, the Board of Fire Commissioners on which Kimber\n\nserved is an entity separate from the CSB. Kimber was not a member\nof the CSB. Kimber, JUSTICE ALITO states, requested a private meeting\nwith the CSB. Ante, at 6. There is not a shred of evidence that a\nprivate meeting with Kimber or anyone else took place.\n   20 JUSTICE ALITO points to evidence that the mayor had decided not to\n\nmake promotions based on the exams even if the CSB voted to certify\nthe results, going so far as to prepare a press release to that effect.\nAnte, at 9. If anything, this evidence reinforces the conclusion that the\nCSB\u2014which made the noncertification decision\u2014remained independ\nent and above the political fray. The mayor and his staff needed a\ncontingency plan precisely because they did not control the CSB.\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            37\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nincluding a racial constituency\u2014without engaging in\nunlawful discrimination.       As courts have recognized,\n\u201c[p]oliticians routinely respond to bad press . . . , but it is\nnot a violation of Title VII to take advantage of a situation\nto gain political favor.\u201d Henry v. Jones, 507 F. 3d 558, 567\n(CA7 2007).\n   The real issue, then, is not whether the mayor and his\nstaff were politically motivated; it is whether their at\ntempt to score political points was legitimate (i.e., nondis\ncriminatory). Were they seeking to exclude white fire\nfighters from promotion (unlikely, as a fair test would\nundoubtedly result in the addition of white firefighters to\nthe officer ranks), or did they realize, at least belatedly,\nthat their tests could be toppled in a disparate-impact\nsuit? In the latter case, there is no disparate-treatment\nviolation. JUSTICE ALITO, I recognize, would disagree. In\nhis view, an employer\u2019s action to avoid Title VII disparate\nimpact liability qualifies as a presumptively improper\nrace-based employment decision. See ante, at 2. I reject\nthat construction of Title VII. See supra, at 18\u201320. As I\nsee it, when employers endeavor to avoid exposure to\ndisparate-impact liability, they do not thereby encounter\nliability for disparate treatment.\n   Applying this understanding of Title VII, supported by\nGriggs and the long line of decisions following Griggs, see\nsupra, at 16\u201317, and nn. 3\u20134, the District Court found no\ngenuine dispute of material fact. That court noted, par\nticularly, the guidance furnished by Second Circuit prece\ndent. See supra, at 12. Petitioners\u2019 allegations that City\nofficials took account of politics, the District Court deter\nmined, simply \u201cd[id] not suffice\u201d to create an inference of\nunlawful discrimination. 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 160, n. 12.\nThe noncertification decision, even if undertaken \u201cin a\npolitical context,\u201d reflected a legitimate \u201cintent not to\nimplement a promotional process based on testing results\nthat had an adverse impact.\u201d Id., at 158, 160. Indeed, the\n38                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court perceived \u201ca total absence of any evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus towards [petitioners].\u201d Id., at 158.\nSee also id., at 162 (\u201cNothing in the record in this case\nsuggests that the City defendants or CSB acted \u2018because\nof\u2019 discriminatory animus toward [petitioners] or other\nnon-minority applicants for promotion.\u201d). Perhaps the\nDistrict Court could have been more expansive in its\ndiscussion of these issues, but its conclusions appear\nentirely consistent with the record before it.21\n   It is indeed regrettable that the City\u2019s noncertification\ndecision would have required all candidates to go through\nanother selection process. But it would have been more\nregrettable to rely on flawed exams to shut out candidates\nwho may well have the command presence and other\nqualities needed to excel as fire officers. Yet that is the\nchoice the Court makes today. It is a choice that breaks\nthe promise of Griggs that groups long denied equal oppor\ntunity would not be held back by tests \u201cfair in form, but\ndiscriminatory in operation.\u201d 401 U. S., at 431.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   21 The District Court, JUSTICE ALITO writes, \u201call but conceded that a\n\njury could find that the City\u2019s asserted justification was pretextual\u201d by\n\u201cadmitt[ing] that \u2018a jury could rationally infer that city officials worked\nbehind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because\nthey knew that, were the exams certified, the Mayor would incur the\nwrath of [Rev. Boise] Kimber and other influential leaders of New\nHaven\u2019s African-American community.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 3, 13 (quoting 554 F.\nSupp. 2d, at 162). The District Court drew the quoted passage from\npetitioners\u2019 lower court brief, and used it in reference to a First Amend\nment claim not before this Court. In any event, it is not apparent why\nthese alleged political maneuvers suggest an intent to discriminate\nagainst petitioners. That City officials may have wanted to please\npolitical supporters is entirely consistent with their stated desire to\navoid a disparate-impact violation. Cf. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 18) (allegations that senior Government officials\ncondoned the arrest and detention of thousands of Arab Muslim men\nfollowing the September 11 attacks failed to establish even a \u201cplausible\ninference\u201d of unlawful discrimination sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss).\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Argued April 22, 2009\u2014Decided June 29, 2009*\nNew Haven, Conn. (City), uses objective examinations to identify those\n firefighters best qualified for promotion. When the results of such an\n exam to fill vacant lieutenant and captain positions showed that\n white candidates had outperformed minority candidates, a rancorous\n public debate ensued. Confronted with arguments both for and\n against certifying the test results\u2014and threats of a lawsuit either\n way\u2014the City threw out the results based on the statistical racial\n disparity. Petitioners, white and Hispanic firefighters who passed\n the exams but were denied a chance at promotions by the City\u2019s re\n fusal to certify the test results, sued the City and respondent officials,\n alleging that discarding the test results discriminated against them\n based on their race in violation of, inter alia, Title VII of the Civil\n Rights Act of 1964. The defendants responded that had they certified\n the test results, they could have faced Title VII liability for adopting\n a practice having a disparate impact on minority firefighters. The\n District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants, and\n the Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The City\u2019s action in discarding the tests violated Title VII.\n  Pp. 16\u201334.\n     (a) Title VII prohibits intentional acts of employment discrimina\n  tion based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1) (disparate treatment), as well as policies or practices\n  that are not intended to discriminate but in fact have a dispropor\n  tionately adverse effect on minorities, \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(i) (disparate\n  impact).

DESTEFANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    rate impact, the employer may defend by demonstrating that its\n    policy or practice is \u201cjob related for the position in question and con\n    sistent with business necessity.\u201d Ibid. If the employer meets that\n    burden, the plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer\n    refuses to adopt an available alternative practice that has less dispa\n    rate impact and serves the employer\u2019s legitimate needs. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u2013\n    2(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C). Pp. 17\u201319.\n       (b) Under Title VII, before an employer can engage in intentional\n    discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an\n    unintentional, disparate impact, the employer must have a strong\n    basis in evidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact li\n    ability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.\n    The Court\u2019s analysis begins with the premise that the City\u2019s actions\n    would violate Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment prohibition absent some\n    valid defense. All the evidence demonstrates that the City rejected\n    the test results because the higher scoring candidates were white.\n    Without some other justification, this express, race-based decision\n    making is prohibited. The question, therefore, is whether the pur\n    pose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\n    be prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. The Court has\n    considered cases similar to the present litigation, but in the context\n    of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Such cases\n    can provide helpful guidance in this statutory context. See Watson v.\n    Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 993. In those cases, the\n    Court held that certain government actions to remedy past racial dis\n    crimination\u2014actions that are themselves based on race\u2014are consti\n    tutional only where there is a \u201cstrong basis in evidence\u201d that the re\n    medial actions were necessary. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488\n    U. S. 469, 500; see also Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267,\n    277. In announcing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the Wy\n    gant plurality recognized the tension between eliminating segrega\n    tion and discrimination on the one hand and doing away with all gov\n    ernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on the other. 476\n    U. S., at 277. It reasoned that \u201c[e]videntiary support for the conclu\n    sion that remedial action is warranted becomes crucial when the re\n    medial program is challenged in court by nonminority employees.\u201d\n    Ibid. The same interests are at work in the interplay between Title\n    VII\u2019s disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions. Apply\n    ing the strong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect to\n    both provisions, allowing violations of one in the name of compliance\n    with the other only in certain, narrow circumstances. It also allows\n    the disparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is consis\n    tent with other Title VII provisions, including the prohibition on ad\n    justing employment-related test scores based on race, see \u00a72000e\u2013\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n2(l), and the section that expressly protects bona fide promotional ex\nams, see \u00a72000e\u20132(h). Thus, the Court adopts the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard as a matter of statutory construction in order to\nresolve any conflict between Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment and dis\nparate-impact provisions. Pp. 19\u201326.\n   (c) The City\u2019s race-based rejection of the test results cannot satisfy\nthe strong-basis-in-evidence standard. Pp. 26\u201334.\n      (i) The racial adverse impact in this litigation was significant,\nand petitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a prima\nfacie case of disparate-impact liability. The problem for respondents\nis that such a prima facie case\u2014essentially, a threshold showing of a\nsignificant statistical disparity, Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U. S. 440,\n446, and nothing more\u2014is far from a strong basis in evidence that\nthe City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the\ntest results. That is because the City could be liable for disparate\nimpact discrimination only if the exams at issue were not job related\nand consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally\nvalid, less discriminatory alternative that served the City\u2019s needs but\nthat the City refused to adopt. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A), (C). Based on the\nrecord the parties developed through discovery, there is no substan\ntial basis in evidence that the test was deficient in either respect.\nPp. 26\u201328.\n      (ii) The City\u2019s assertions that the exams at issue were not job re\nlated and consistent with business necessity are blatantly contra\ndicted by the record, which demonstrates the detailed steps taken to\ndevelop and administer the tests and the painstaking analyses of the\nquestions asked to assure their relevance to the captain and lieuten\nant positions. The testimony also shows that complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not specifically ap\nply to firefighting practices in the City were fully addressed, and that\nthe City turned a blind eye to evidence supporting the exams\u2019 valid\nity. Pp. 28\u201329.\n      (iii) Respondents also lack a strong basis in evidence showing an\nequally valid, less discriminatory testing alternative that the City, by\ncertifying the test results, would necessarily have refused to adopt.\nRespondents\u2019 three arguments to the contrary all fail. First, respon\ndents refer to testimony that a different composite-score calculation\nwould have allowed the City to consider black candidates for then\nopen positions, but they have produced no evidence to show that the\ncandidate weighting actually used was indeed arbitrary, or that the\ndifferent weighting would be an equally valid way to determine\nwhether candidates are qualified for promotions. Second, respon\ndents argue that the City could have adopted a different interpreta\ntion of its charter provision limiting promotions to the highest scoring\n4                         RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    applicants, and that the interpretation would have produced less dis\n    criminatory results; but respondents\u2019 approach would have violated\n    Title VII\u2019s prohibition of race-based adjustment of test results,\n    \u00a72000e\u20132(l). Third, testimony asserting that the use of an assess\n    ment center to evaluate candidates\u2019 behavior in typical job tasks\n    would have had less adverse impact than written exams does not aid\n    respondents, as it is contradicted by other statements in the record\n    indicating that the City could not have used assessment centers for\n    the exams at issue. Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis\n    in-evidence standard applies to this case, respondents cannot create a\n    genuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradictory) state\n    ments in the record. Pp. 29\u201333.\n         (iv) Fear of litigation alone cannot justify the City\u2019s reliance on\n    race to the detriment of individuals who passed the examinations and\n    qualified for promotions. Discarding the test results was impermis\n    sible under Title VII, and summary judgment is appropriate for peti\n    tioners on their disparate-treatment claim. If, after it certifies the\n    test results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of\n    today\u2019s holding the City can avoid disparate-impact liability based on\n    the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified the results, it\n    would have been subject to disparate-treatment liability.

An agency\u2019s officers command respect within the\ndepartment and in the whole community; and, of course,\nadded responsibilities command increased salary and\nbenefits. Aware of the intense competition for promotions,\nNew Haven, like many cities, relies on objective examina\ntions to identify the best qualified candidates.\n   In 2003, 118 New Haven firefighters took examinations\nto qualify for promotion to the rank of lieutenant or cap\ntain. Promotion examinations in New Haven (or City)\nwere infrequent, so the stakes were high. The results\nwould determine which firefighters would be considered\nfor promotions during the next two years, and the order in\nwhich they would be considered. Many firefighters stud\n2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nied for months, at considerable personal and financial cost.\n  When the examination results showed that white candi\ndates had outperformed minority candidates, the mayor\nand other local politicians opened a public debate that\nturned rancorous. Some firefighters argued the tests\nshould be discarded because the results showed the tests\nto be discriminatory. They threatened a discrimination\nlawsuit if the City made promotions based on the tests.\nOther firefighters said the exams were neutral and fair.\nAnd they, in turn, threatened a discrimination lawsuit if\nthe City, relying on the statistical racial disparity, ignored\nthe test results and denied promotions to the candidates\nwho had performed well. In the end the City took the side\nof those who protested the test results. It threw out the\nexaminations.\n  Certain white and Hispanic firefighters who likely\nwould have been promoted based on their good test per\nformance sued the City and some of its officials. Theirs is\nthe suit now before us. The suit alleges that, by discard\ning the test results, the City and the named officials dis\ncriminated against the plaintiffs based on their race, in\nviolation of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., and\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend\nment. The City and the officials defended their actions,\narguing that if they had certified the results, they could\nhave faced liability under Title VII for adopting a practice\nthat had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendants, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n  We conclude that race-based action like the City\u2019s in this\ncase is impermissible under Title VII unless the employer\ncan demonstrate a strong basis in evidence that, had it not\ntaken the action, it would have been liable under the\ndisparate-impact statute. The respondents, we further\ndetermine, cannot meet that threshold standard. As a\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

In light of our ruling under the\nstatutes, we need not reach the question whether respon\ndents\u2019 actions may have violated the Equal Protection\nClause.\n                             I\n   This litigation comes to us after the parties\u2019 cross\nmotions for summary judgment, so we set out the facts in\nsome detail. As the District Court noted, although \u201cthe\nparties strenuously dispute the relevance and legal import\nof, and inferences to be drawn from, many aspects of this\ncase, the underlying facts are largely undisputed.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (Conn. 2006).\n                             A\n   When the City of New Haven undertook to fill vacant\nlieutenant and captain positions in its fire department\n(Department), the promotion and hiring process was gov\nerned by the city charter, in addition to federal and state\nlaw. The charter establishes a merit system. That system\nrequires the City to fill vacancies in the classified civil\nservice ranks with the most qualified individuals, as de\ntermined by job-related examinations. After each exami\nnation, the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) certifies\na ranked list of applicants who passed the test. Under the\ncharter\u2019s \u201crule of three,\u201d the relevant hiring authority\nmust fill each vacancy by choosing one candidate from the\ntop three scorers on the list. Certified promotional lists\nremain valid for two years.\n   The City\u2019s contract with the New Haven firefighters\u2019\nunion specifies additional requirements for the promotion\nprocess. Under the contract, applicants for lieutenant and\ncaptain positions were to be screened using written and\noral examinations, with the written exam accounting for\n60 percent and the oral exam 40 percent of an applicant\u2019s\n4                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntotal score. To sit for the examinations, candidates for\nlieutenant needed 30 months\u2019 experience in the Depart\nment, a high-school diploma, and certain vocational train\ning courses. Candidates for captain needed one year\u2019s\nservice as a lieutenant in the Department, a high-school\ndiploma, and certain vocational training courses.\n   After reviewing bids from various consultants, the City\nhired Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc. (IOS) to\ndevelop and administer the examinations, at a cost to the\nCity of $100,000. IOS is an Illinois company that special\nizes in designing entry-level and promotional examina\ntions for fire and police departments. In order to fit the\nexaminations to the New Haven Department, IOS began\nthe test-design process by performing job analyses to\nidentify the tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities that are\nessential for the lieutenant and captain positions. IOS\nrepresentatives interviewed incumbent captains and\nlieutenants and their supervisors. They rode with and\nobserved other on-duty officers. Using information from\nthose interviews and ride-alongs, IOS wrote job-analysis\nquestionnaires and administered them to most of the\nincumbent battalion chiefs, captains, and lieutenants in\nthe Department. At every stage of the job analyses, IOS,\nby deliberate choice, oversampled minority firefighters to\nensure that the results\u2014which IOS would use to develop\nthe examinations\u2014would not unintentionally favor white\ncandidates.\n   With the job-analysis information in hand, IOS devel\noped the written examinations to measure the candidates\u2019\njob-related knowledge. For each test, IOS compiled a list\nof training manuals, Department procedures, and other\nmaterials to use as sources for the test questions. IOS\npresented the proposed sources to the New Haven fire\nchief and assistant fire chief for their approval. Then,\nusing the approved sources, IOS drafted a multiple-choice\ntest for each position. Each test had 100 questions, as\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired by CSB rules, and was written below a 10th\ngrade reading level. After IOS prepared the tests, the City\nopened a 3-month study period. It gave candidates a list\nthat identified the source material for the questions, in\ncluding the specific chapters from which the questions\nwere taken.\n   IOS developed the oral examinations as well. These\nconcentrated on job skills and abilities. Using the job\nanalysis information, IOS wrote hypothetical situations to\ntest incident-command skills, firefighting tactics, interper\nsonal skills, leadership, and management ability, among\nother things. Candidates would be presented with these\nhypotheticals and asked to respond before a panel of three\nassessors.\n   IOS assembled a pool of 30 assessors who were superior\nin rank to the positions being tested. At the City\u2019s insis\ntence (because of controversy surrounding previous ex\naminations), all the assessors came from outside Connecti\ncut. IOS submitted the assessors\u2019 resumes to City officials\nfor approval. They were battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs,\nand chiefs from departments of similar sizes to New Ha\nven\u2019s throughout the country. Sixty-six percent of the\npanelists were minorities, and each of the nine three\nmember assessment panels contained two minority mem\nbers. IOS trained the panelists for several hours on the\nday before it administered the examinations, teaching\nthem how to score the candidates\u2019 responses consistently\nusing checklists of desired criteria.\n   Candidates took the examinations in November and\nDecember 2003. Seventy-seven candidates completed the\nlieutenant examination\u201443 whites, 19 blacks, and 15\nHispanics. Of those, 34 candidates passed\u201425 whites, 6\nblacks, and 3 Hispanics. 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 145. Eight\nlieutenant positions were vacant at the time of the exami\nnation. As the rule of three operated, this meant that the\ntop 10 candidates were eligible for an immediate promo\n6                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion to lieutenant. All 10 were white. Ibid. Subsequent\nvacancies would have allowed at least 3 black candidates\nto be considered for promotion to lieutenant.\n   Forty-one candidates completed the captain examina\ntion\u201425 whites, 8 blacks, and 8 Hispanics. Of those, 22\ncandidates passed\u201416 whites, 3 blacks, and 3 Hispanics.\nIbid. Seven captain positions were vacant at the time of\nthe examination. Under the rule of three, 9 candidates\nwere eligible for an immediate promotion to captain\u20147\nwhites and 2 Hispanics. Ibid.\n                             B\n   The City\u2019s contract with IOS contemplated that, after\nthe examinations, IOS would prepare a technical report\nthat described the examination processes and methodolo\ngies and analyzed the results. But in January 2004,\nrather than requesting the technical report, City officials,\nincluding the City\u2019s counsel, Thomas Ude, convened a\nmeeting with IOS Vice President Chad Legel. (Legel was\nthe leader of the IOS team that developed and adminis\ntered the tests.) Based on the test results, the City offi\ncials expressed concern that the tests had discriminated\nagainst minority candidates. Legel defended the examina\ntions\u2019 validity, stating that any numerical disparity be\ntween white and minority candidates was likely due to\nvarious external factors and was in line with results of the\nDepartment\u2019s previous promotional examinations.\n   Several days after the meeting, Ude sent a letter to the\nCSB purporting to outline its duties with respect to the\nexamination results. Ude stated that under federal law,\n\u201ca statistical demonstration of disparate impact,\u201d standing\nalone, \u201cconstitutes a sufficiently serious claim of racial\ndiscrimination to serve as a predicate for employer\ninitiated, voluntar[y] remedies\u2014even . . . race-conscious\nremedies.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 443a;\nsee also 554 F.

She distributed lists showing the candi\ndates\u2019 races and scores (written, oral, and composite) but\nnot their names. Ude also described the test results as\nreflecting \u201ca very significant disparate impact,\u201d id., at\n477a, and he outlined possible grounds for the CSB\u2019s\nrefusing to certify the results.\n   Although they did not know whether they had passed or\nfailed, some firefighter-candidates spoke at the first CSB\nmeeting in favor of certifying the test results. Michael\nBlatchley stated that \u201c[e]very one\u201d of the questions on the\nwritten examination \u201ccame from the [study] material. . . .\n[I]f you read the materials and you studied the material,\nyou would have done well on the test.\u201d App. in No. 06\u2013\n4996\u2013cv (CA2), pp. A772\u2013A773 (hereinafter CA2 App.).\nFrank Ricci stated that the test questions were based on\nthe Department\u2019s own rules and procedures and on \u201cna\ntionally recognized\u201d materials that represented the \u201cac\ncepted standard[s]\u201d for firefighting. Id., at A785\u2013A786.\nRicci stated that he had \u201cseveral learning disabilities,\u201d\nincluding dyslexia; that he had spent more than $1,000 to\npurchase the materials and pay his neighbor to read them\non tape so he could \u201cgive it [his] best shot\u201d; and that he\nhad studied \u201c8 to 13 hours a day to prepare\u201d for the test.\nId., at A786, A789. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I made it,\u201d Ricci\ntold the CSB, \u201c[b]ut the people who passed should be\npromoted. When your life\u2019s on the line, second best may\nnot be good enough.\u201d Id., at A787\u2013A788.\n   Other firefighters spoke against certifying the test\n8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresults. They described the test questions as outdated or\nnot relevant to firefighting practices in New Haven. Gary\nTinney stated that source materials \u201ccame out of New\nYork. . . . Their makeup of their city and everything is\ntotally different than ours.\u201d Id., at A774\u2013A775; see also\nid., at A779, A780\u2013A781. And they criticized the test\nmaterials, a full set of which cost about $500, for being too\nexpensive and too long.\n                              2\n   At a second CSB meeting, on February 5, the president\nof the New Haven firefighters\u2019 union asked the CSB to\nperform a validation study to determine whether the tests\nwere job-related. Petitioners\u2019 counsel in this action argued\nthat the CSB should certify the results. A representative\nof the International Association of Black Professional\nFirefighters, Donald Day from neighboring Bridgeport,\nConnecticut, \u201cbeseech[ed]\u201d the CSB \u201cto throw away that\ntest,\u201d which he described as \u201cinherently unfair\u201d because of\nthe racial distribution of the results. Id., at A830\u2013A831.\nAnother Bridgeport-based representative of the associa\ntion, Ronald Mackey, stated that a validation study was\nnecessary. He suggested that the City could \u201cadjust\u201d the\ntest results to \u201cmeet the criteria of having a certain\namount of minorities get elevated to the rank of Lieuten\nant and Captain.\u201d Id., at A838. At the end of this meet\ning, the CSB members agreed to ask IOS to send a repre\nsentative to explain how it had developed and\nadministered the examinations.        They also discussed\nasking a panel of experts to review the examinations and\nadvise the CSB whether to certify the results.\n                             3\n  At a third meeting, on February 11, Legel addressed the\nCSB on behalf of IOS. Legel stated that IOS had previ\nously prepared entry-level firefighter examinations for the\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCity but not a promotional examination. He explained\nthat IOS had developed examinations for departments in\ncommunities with demographics similar to New Haven\u2019s,\nincluding Orange County, Florida; Lansing, Michigan; and\nSan Jose, California.\n   Legel explained the exam-development process to the\nCSB. He began by describing the job analyses IOS per\nformed of the captain and lieutenant positions\u2014the inter\nviews, ride-alongs, and questionnaires IOS designed to\n\u201cgenerate a list of tasks, knowledge, skills and abilities\nthat are considered essential to performance\u201d of the jobs.\nId., at A931\u2013A932. He outlined how IOS prepared the\nwritten and oral examinations, based on the job-analysis\nresults, to test most heavily those qualities that the re\nsults indicated were \u201ccritica[l]\u201d or \u201cessentia[l].\u201d Id., at\nA931. And he noted that IOS took the material for each\ntest question directly from the approved source materials.\nLegel told the CSB that third-party reviewers had scruti\nnized the examinations to ensure that the written test was\ndrawn from the source material and that the oral test\naccurately tested real-world situations that captains and\nlieutenants would face. Legel confirmed that IOS had\nselected oral-examination panelists so that each three\nmember assessment panel included one white, one black,\nand one Hispanic member.\n   Near the end of his remarks, Legel \u201cimplor[ed] anyone\nthat had . . . concerns to review the content of the exam.\nIn my professional opinion, it\u2019s facially neutral. There\u2019s\nnothing in those examinations . . . that should cause\nsomebody to think that one group would perform differ\nently than another group.\u201d Id., at A961.\n                              4\n  At the next meeting, on March 11, the CSB heard from\nthree witnesses it had selected to \u201ctell us a little bit about\ntheir views of the testing, the process, [and] the methodol\n10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nogy.\u201d Id., at A1020. The first, Christopher Hornick, spoke\nto the CSB by telephone.           Hornick is an indus\ntrial/organizational psychologist from Texas who operates\na consulting business that \u201cdirect[ly]\u201d competes with IOS.\nId., at A1029. Hornick, who had not \u201cstud[ied] the test at\nlength or in detail\u201d and had not \u201cseen the job analysis\ndata,\u201d told the CSB that the scores indicated a \u201crelatively\nhigh adverse impact.\u201d Id., at A1028, A1030, A1043. He\nstated that \u201c[n]ormally, whites outperform ethnic minori\nties on the majority of standardized testing procedures,\u201d\nbut that he was \u201ca little surprised\u201d by the disparity in the\ncandidates\u2019 scores\u2014although \u201c[s]ome of it is fairly typical\nof what we\u2019ve seen in other areas of the countr[y] and\nother tests.\u201d Id., at A1028\u2013A1029. Hornick stated that\nthe \u201cadverse impact on the written exam was somewhat\nhigher but generally in the range that we\u2019ve seen profes\nsionally.\u201d Id., at A1030\u2013A1031.\n   When asked to explain the New Haven test results,\nHornick opined in the telephone conversation that the\ncollective-bargaining agreement\u2019s requirement of using\nwritten and oral examinations with a 60/40 composite\nscore might account for the statistical disparity. He also\nstated that \u201c[b]y not having anyone from within the\n[D]epartment review\u201d the tests before they were adminis\ntered\u2014a limitation the City had imposed to protect the\nsecurity of the exam questions\u2014\u201cyou inevitably get things\nin there\u201d that are based on the source materials but are\nnot relevant to New Haven.

Hornick stated that assessment centers, where\ncandidates face real-world situations and respond just as\nthey would in the field, allow candidates \u201cto demonstrate\nhow they would address a particular problem as opposed\nto just verbally saying it or identifying the correct option\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

He described\nthe IOS examinations as \u201creasonably good test[s].\u201d Id., at\nA1041. He stated that the CSB\u2019s best option might be to\n\u201ccertify the list as it exists\u201d and work to change the proc\ness for future tests, including by \u201c[r]ewriting the Civil\nService Rules.\u201d Ibid. Hornick concluded his telephonic\nremarks by telling the CSB that \u201cfor the future,\u201d his com\npany \u201ccertainly would like to help you if we can.\u201d Id., at\nA1046.\n   The second witness was Vincent Lewis, a fire program\nspecialist for the Department of Homeland Security and a\nretired fire captain from Michigan. Lewis, who is black,\nhad looked \u201cextensively\u201d at the lieutenant exam and \u201ca\nlittle less extensively\u201d at the captain exam. He stated that\nthe candidates \u201cshould know that material.\u201d Id., at\nA1048, A1052. In Lewis\u2019s view, the \u201cquestions were rele\nvant for both exams,\u201d and the New Haven candidates had\nan advantage because the study materials identified the\nparticular book chapters from which the questions were\ntaken. In other departments, by contrast, \u201cyou had to\nknow basically the . . . entire book.\u201d Id., at A1053. Lewis\nconcluded that any disparate impact likely was due to a\npattern that \u201cusually whites outperform some of the mi\nnorities on testing,\u201d or that \u201cmore whites . . . take the\nexam.\u201d Id., at A1054.\n   The final witness was Janet Helms, a professor at Bos\nton College whose \u201cprimary area of expertise\u201d is \u201cnot with\nfirefighters per se\u201d but in \u201crace and culture as they influ\nence performance on tests and other assessment proce\ndures.\u201d Id., at A1060. Helms expressly declined the CSB\u2019s\noffer to review the examinations. At the outset, she noted\nthat \u201cregardless of what kind of written test we give in\nthis country . . . we can just about predict how many peo\n12                  RICCI v.

And your data are not that inconsistent with\nwhat predictions would say were the case.\u201d Id., at A1061.\nHelms nevertheless offered several \u201cideas about what\nmight be possible factors\u201d to explain statistical differences\nin the results. Id., at A1062. She concluded that because\n67 percent of the respondents to the job-analysis question\nnaires were white, the test questions might have favored\nwhite candidates, because \u201cmost of the literature on fire\nfighters shows that the different groups perform the job\ndifferently.\u201d Id., at A1063. Helms closed by stating that\nno matter what test the City had administered, it would\nhave revealed \u201ca disparity between blacks and whites,\nHispanics and whites,\u201d particularly on a written test. Id.,\nat A1072.\n                              5\n  At the final CSB meeting, on March 18, Ude (the City\u2019s\ncounsel) argued against certifying the examination re\nsults. Discussing the City\u2019s obligations under federal law,\nUde advised the CSB that a finding of adverse impact \u201cis\nthe beginning, not the end, of a review of testing proce\ndures\u201d to determine whether they violated the disparate\nimpact provision of Title VII. Ude focused the CSB on\ndetermining \u201cwhether there are other ways to test for . . .\nthose positions that are equally valid with less adverse\nimpact.\u201d Id., at A1101. Ude described Hornick as having\nsaid that the written examination \u201chad one of the most\nsevere adverse impacts that he had seen\u201d and that \u201cthere\nare much better alternatives to identifying [firefighting]\nskills.\u201d Ibid. Ude offered his \u201copinion that promotions . . .\nas a result of these tests would not be consistent with\nfederal law, would not be consistent with the purposes of\nour Civil Service Rules or our Charter[,] nor is it in the\nbest interests of the firefighters . . . who took the exams.\u201d\nId., at A1103\u2013A1104.

It\u2019s not our burden to show that\n    there\u2019s an exam out there that can be better. We\u2019ve\n    got an exam. We\u2019ve got a result. . . .\n       \u201cMR. UDE: Mr. Chair, I point out that Dr. Hornick\n    said that. He said that there are other tests out there\n    that would have less adverse impact and that [would]\n    be more valid.\n       \u201cCHAIRPERSON SEGALOFF: You think that\u2019s\n    enough for us to throw this test upside-down . . . be\n    cause Dr. Hornick said it?\n       \u201cMR. UDE: I think that by itself would be sufficient.\n    Yes. I also would point out that . . . it is the em\n    ployer\u2019s burden to justify the use of the examination.\u201d\n    Id., at A1108\u2013A1109.\n  Karen DuBois-Walton, the City\u2019s chief administrative\nofficer, spoke on behalf of Mayor John DeStefano and\nargued against certifying the results. DuBois-Walton\nstated that the results, when considered under the rule of\nthree and applied to then-existing captain and lieutenant\nvacancies, created a situation in which black and Hispanic\ncandidates were disproportionately excluded from oppor\ntunity. DuBois-Walton also relied on Hornick\u2019s testimony,\nasserting that Hornick \u201cmade it extremely clear that . . .\nthere are more appropriate ways to assess one\u2019s ability to\nserve\u201d as a captain or lieutenant. Id., at A1120.\n14                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Burgett (the human resources director) asked the CSB\nto discard the examination results. She, too, relied on\nHornick\u2019s statement to show the existence of alternative\ntesting methods, describing Hornick as having \u201cstarted to\npoint out that alternative testing does exist\u201d and as having\n\u201cbegun to suggest that there are some different ways of\ndoing written examinations.\u201d Id., at A1125, A1128.\n   Other witnesses addressed the CSB. They included the\npresident of the New Haven firefighters\u2019 union, who sup\nported certification. He reminded the CSB that Hornick\n\u201calso concluded that the tests were reasonable and fair\nand under the current structure to certify them.\u201d Id., at\nA1137. Firefighter Frank Ricci again argued for certifica\ntion; he stated that although \u201cassessment centers in some\ncases show less adverse impact,\u201d id., at A1140, they were\nnot available alternatives for the current round of promo\ntions. It would take several years, Ricci explained, for the\nDepartment to develop an assessment-center protocol and\nthe accompanying training materials. Id., at A1141.\nLieutenant Matthew Marcarelli, who had taken the cap\ntain\u2019s exam, spoke in favor of certification.\n   At the close of witness testimony, the CSB voted on a\nmotion to certify the examinations. With one member\nrecused, the CSB deadlocked 2 to 2, resulting in a decision\nnot to certify the results. Explaining his vote to certify the\nresults, Chairman Segaloff stated that \u201cnobody convinced\nme that we can feel comfortable that, in fact, there\u2019s some\nlikelihood that there\u2019s going to be an exam designed that\u2019s\ngoing to be less discriminatory.\u201d Id., at A1159\u2013A1160.\n                             C\n   The CSB\u2019s decision not to certify the examination re\nsults led to this lawsuit.

They include the named plaintiff, Frank\nRicci, who addressed the CSB at multiple meetings.\n   Petitioners sued the City, Mayor DeStefano, DuBois-\nWalton, Ude, Burgett, and the two CSB members who\nvoted against certification. Petitioners also named as a\ndefendant Boise Kimber, a New Haven resident who\nvoiced strong opposition to certifying the results. Those\nindividuals are respondents in this Court. Petitioners\nfiled suit under Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a71979 and 1980, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71983 and 1985, alleging that respondents, by arguing or\nvoting against certifying the results, violated and con\nspired to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment. Petitioners also filed timely charges\nof discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC); upon the EEOC\u2019s issuing right\nto-sue letters, petitioners amended their complaint to\nassert that the City violated the disparate-treatment\nprohibition contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, as amended. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(a).\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\nRespondents asserted they had a good-faith belief that\nthey would have violated the disparate-impact prohibition\nin Title VII, \u00a72000e\u20132(k), had they certified the examina\ntion results. It follows, they maintained, that they cannot\nbe held liable under Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment provi\nsion for attempting to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact bar. Petitioners countered that respondents\u2019 good\nfaith belief was not a valid defense to allegations of dispa\nrate treatment and unconstitutional discrimination.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nrespondents. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The District Court concluded\nthat, \u201c[n]otwithstanding the shortcomings in the evidence\non existing, effective alternatives, it is not the case that\n[respondents] must certify a test where they cannot pin\npoint its deficiency explaining its disparate impact . . .\nsimply because they have not yet formulated a better\nselection method.\u201d Ibid. It also ruled that respondents\u2019\n\u201cmotivation to avoid making promotions based on a test\nwith a racially disparate impact . . . does not, as a matter\nof law, constitute discriminatory intent\u201d under Title VII.\nId., at 160. The District Court rejected petitioners\u2019 equal\nprotection claim on the theory that respondents had not\nacted because of \u201cdiscriminatory animus\u201d toward petition\ners. Id., at 162. It concluded that respondents\u2019 actions\nwere not \u201cbased on race\u201d because \u201call applicants took the\nsame test, and the result was the same for all because the\ntest results were discarded and nobody was promoted.\u201d\nId., at 161.\n   After full briefing and argument by the parties, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed in a one-paragraph, unpub\nlished summary order; it later withdrew that order, issu\ning in its place a nearly identical, one-paragraph per\ncuriam opinion adopting the District Court\u2019s reasoning.\n530 F. 3d 87 (CA2 2008). Three days later, the Court of\nAppeals voted 7 to 6 to deny rehearing en banc, over writ\nten dissents by Chief Judge Jacobs and Judge Cabranes.\n530 F. 3d 88.\n   This action presents two provisions of Title VII to be\ninterpreted and reconciled, with few, if any, precedents in\nthe courts of appeals discussing the issue.

A decision for petitioners on their\nstatutory claim would provide the relief sought, so we\nconsider it first. See Atkins v. Parker, 472 U. S. 115, 123\n(1985); Escambia County v. McMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51\n(1984) (per curiam) (\u201c[N]ormally the Court will not decide\na constitutional question if there is some other ground\nupon which to dispose of the case\u201d).\n                             A\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e et seq., as amended, prohibits employment dis\ncrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin. Title VII prohibits both intentional dis\ncrimination (known as \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d) as well as,\nin some cases, practices that are not intended to discrimi\nnate but in fact have a disproportionately adverse effect on\nminorities (known as \u201cdisparate impact\u201d).\n   As enacted in 1964, Title VII\u2019s principal nondiscrimina\ntion provision held employers liable only for disparate\ntreatment. That section retains its original wording to\nday. It makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ\nment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1); see also 78 Stat. 255.\nDisparate-treatment cases present \u201cthe most easily under\nstood type of discrimination,\u201d Teamsters v. United States,\n431 U. S. 324, 335, n. 15 (1977), and occur where an em\nployer has \u201ctreated [a] particular person less favorably\nthan others because of\u201d a protected trait. Watson v. Fort\nWorth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 985\u2013986 (1988). A\n18                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndisparate-treatment plaintiff must establish \u201cthat the\ndefendant had a discriminatory intent or motive\u201d for\ntaking a job-related action. Id., at 986.\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not include an express\nprohibition on policies or practices that produce a dispa\nrate impact. But in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S.\n424 (1971), the Court interpreted the Act to prohibit, in\nsome cases, employers\u2019 facially neutral practices that, in\nfact, are \u201cdiscriminatory in operation.\u201d Id., at 431. The\nGriggs Court stated that the \u201ctouchstone\u201d for disparate\nimpact liability is the lack of \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d: \u201cIf an\nemployment practice which operates to exclude [minori\nties] cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the\npractice is prohibited.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 432 (em\nployer\u2019s burden to demonstrate that practice has \u201ca mani\nfest relationship to the employment in question\u201d); Albe\nmarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 425 (1975).\nUnder those precedents, if an employer met its burden by\nshowing that its practice was job-related, the plaintiff was\nrequired to show a legitimate alternative that would have\nresulted in less discrimination. Ibid. (allowing complain\ning party to show \u201cthat other tests or selection devices,\nwithout a similarly undesirable racial effect, would also\nserve the employer\u2019s legitimate interest\u201d).\n   Twenty years after Griggs, the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n105 Stat. 1071, was enacted. The Act included a provision\ncodifying the prohibition on disparate-impact discrimina\ntion. That provision is now in force along with the dispa\nrate-treatment section already noted. Under the dispa\nrate-impact statute, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie\nviolation by showing that an employer uses \u201ca particular\nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(i). An employer may defend\nagainst liability by demonstrating that the practice is \u201cjob\nrelated for the position in question and consistent with\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbusiness necessity.\u201d Ibid. Even if the employer meets\nthat burden, however, a plaintiff may still succeed by\nshowing that the employer refuses to adopt an available\nalternative employment practice that has less disparate\nimpact and serves the employer\u2019s legitimate needs.\n\u00a7\u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A)(ii) and (C).\n                              B\n   Petitioners allege that when the CSB refused to certify\nthe captain and lieutenant exam results based on the race\nof the successful candidates, it discriminated against them\nin violation of Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment provision.\nThe City counters that its decision was permissible be\ncause the tests \u201cappear[ed] to violate Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact provisions.\u201d Brief for Respondents 12.\n   Our analysis begins with this premise: The City\u2019s ac\ntions would violate the disparate-treatment prohibition of\nTitle VII absent some valid defense. All the evidence\ndemonstrates that the City chose not to certify the exami\nnation results because of the statistical disparity based on\nrace\u2014i.e., how minority candidates had performed when\ncompared to white candidates. As the District Court put\nit, the City rejected the test results because \u201ctoo many\nwhites and not enough minorities would be promoted were\nthe lists to be certified.\u201d 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 152; see also\nibid. (respondents\u2019 \u201cown arguments . . . show that the\nCity\u2019s reasons for advocating non-certification were re\nlated to the racial distribution of the results\u201d). Without\nsome other justification, this express, race-based deci\nsionmaking violates Title VII\u2019s command that employers\ncannot take adverse employment actions because of an\nindividual\u2019s race. See \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1).\n   The District Court did not adhere to this principle,\nhowever. It held that respondents\u2019 \u201cmotivation to avoid\nmaking promotions based on a test with a racially dispa\nrate impact . . . does not, as a matter of law, constitute\n20                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 160. And the\nGovernment makes a similar argument in this Court. It\ncontends that the \u201cstructure of Title VII belies any claim\nthat an employer\u2019s intent to comply with Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-impact provisions constitutes prohibited discrimina\ntion on the basis of race.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11. But both of those statements turn\nupon the City\u2019s objective\u2014avoiding disparate-impact\nliability\u2014while ignoring the City\u2019s conduct in the name of\nreaching that objective. Whatever the City\u2019s ultimate\naim\u2014however well intentioned or benevolent it might\nhave seemed\u2014the City made its employment decision\nbecause of race. The City rejected the test results solely\nbecause the higher scoring candidates were white. The\nquestion is not whether that conduct was discriminatory\nbut whether the City had a lawful justification for its race\nbased action.\n   We consider, therefore, whether the purpose to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would\nbe prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination. Courts\noften confront cases in which statutes and principles point\nin different directions. Our task is to provide guidance to\nemployers and courts for situations when these two prohi\nbitions could be in conflict absent a rule to reconcile them.\nIn providing this guidance our decision must be consistent\nwith the important purpose of Title VII\u2014that the work\nplace be an environment free of discrimination, where race\nis not a barrier to opportunity.\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the parties\u2019\nproposed means of reconciling the statutory provisions.\nPetitioners take a strict approach, arguing that under\nTitle VII, it cannot be permissible for an employer to take\nrace-based adverse employment actions in order to avoid\ndisparate-impact liability\u2014even if the employer knows its\npractice violates the disparate-impact provision. See Brief\nfor Petitioners 43. Petitioners would have us hold that,\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder Title VII, avoiding unintentional discrimination\ncannot justify intentional discrimination. That assertion,\nhowever, ignores the fact that, by codifying the disparate\nimpact provision in 1991, Congress has expressly prohib\nited both types of discrimination. We must interpret the\nstatute to give effect to both provisions where possible.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Atlantic Research Corp.,\n551 U. S. 128, 137 (2007) (rejecting an interpretation\nthat would render a statutory provision \u201ca dead letter\u201d).\nWe cannot accept petitioners\u2019 broad and inflexible\nformulation.\n   Petitioners next suggest that an employer in fact must\nbe in violation of the disparate-impact provision before it\ncan use compliance as a defense in a disparate-treatment\nsuit. Again, this is overly simplistic and too restrictive of\nTitle VII\u2019s purpose. The rule petitioners offer would run\ncounter to what we have recognized as Congress\u2019s intent\nthat \u201cvoluntary compliance\u201d be \u201cthe preferred means of\nachieving the objectives of Title VII.\u201d Firefighters v. Cleve\nland, 478 U. S. 501, 515 (1986); see also Wygant v. Jack\nson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 290 (1986) (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). Forbid\nding employers to act unless they know, with certainty,\nthat a practice violates the disparate-impact provision\nwould bring compliance efforts to a near standstill. Even\nin the limited situations when this restricted standard\ncould be met, employers likely would hesitate before tak\ning voluntary action for fear of later being proven wrong in\nthe course of litigation and then held to account for dispa\nrate treatment.\n   At the opposite end of the spectrum, respondents and\nthe Government assert that an employer\u2019s good-faith belief\nthat its actions are necessary to comply with Title VII\u2019s\ndisparate-impact provision should be enough to justify\nrace-conscious conduct. But the original, foundational\nprohibition of Title VII bars employers from taking ad\n22                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nverse action \u201cbecause of . . . race.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). And\nwhen Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in\n1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability\nfor actions taken in a good-faith effort to comply with the\nnew, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k). Allow\ning employers to violate the disparate-treatment prohibi\ntion based on a mere good-faith fear of disparate-impact\nliability would encourage race-based action at the slightest\nhint of disparate impact. A minimal standard could cause\nemployers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial\npromotional examinations even where there is little if any\nevidence of disparate-impact discrimination. That would\namount to a de facto quota system, in which a \u201cfocus on\nstatistics . . . could put undue pressure on employers to\nadopt inappropriate prophylactic measures.\u201d Watson, 487\nU. S., at 992 (plurality opinion). Even worse, an employer\ncould discard test results (or other employment practices)\nwith the intent of obtaining the employer\u2019s preferred racial\nbalance. That operational principle could not be justified,\nfor Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of\nits requirements as calling for outright racial balancing.\n\u00a72000e\u20132(j). The purpose of Title VII \u201cis to promote hiring\non the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis\nof race or color.\u201d Griggs, 401 U. S., at 434.\n    In searching for a standard that strikes a more appro\npriate balance, we note that this Court has considered\ncases similar to this one, albeit in the context of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The\nCourt has held that certain government actions to remedy\npast racial discrimination\u2014actions that are themselves\nbased on race\u2014are constitutional only where there is a\n\u201c \u2018strong basis in evidence\u2019 \u201d that the remedial actions were\nnecessary. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469,\n500 (1989) (quoting Wygant, supra, at 277 (plurality opin\nion)). This suit does not call on us to consider whether the\nstatutory constraints under Title VII must be parallel in\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall respects to those under the Constitution. That does not\nmean the constitutional authorities are irrelevant, how\never. Our cases discussing constitutional principles can\nprovide helpful guidance in this statutory context. See\nWatson, supra, at 993 (plurality opinion).\n   Writing for a plurality in Wygant and announcing the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard, Justice Powell recog\nnized the tension between eliminating segregation and\ndiscrimination on the one hand and doing away with all\ngovernmentally imposed discrimination based on race on\nthe other. 476 U. S., at 277. The plurality stated that\nthose \u201crelated constitutional duties are not always harmo\nnious,\u201d and that \u201creconciling them requires . . . employers\nto act with extraordinary care.\u201d Ibid. The plurality re\nquired a strong basis in evidence because \u201c[e]videntiary\nsupport for the conclusion that remedial action is war\nranted becomes crucial when the remedial program is\nchallenged in court by nonminority employees.\u201d Ibid. The\nCourt applied the same standard in Croson, observing that\n\u201can amorphous claim that there has been past discrimina\ntion . . . cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial\nquota.\u201d 488 U. S., at 499.\n   The same interests are at work in the interplay between\nthe disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions\nof Title VII. Congress has imposed liability on employers\nfor unintentional discrimination in order to rid the work\nplace of \u201cpractices that are fair in form, but discriminatory\nin operation.\u201d Griggs, supra, at 431. But it has also pro\nhibited employers from taking adverse employment ac\ntions \u201cbecause of\u201d race. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). Applying the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard to Title VII gives effect\nto both the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact\nprovisions, allowing violations of one in the name of com\npliance with the other only in certain, narrow circum\nstances. The standard leaves ample room for employers\u2019\nvoluntary compliance efforts, which are essential to the\n24                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatutory scheme and to Congress\u2019s efforts to eradicate\nworkplace discrimination. See Firefighters, supra, at 515.\nAnd the standard appropriately constrains employers\u2019\ndiscretion in making race-based decisions: It limits that\ndiscretion to cases in which there is a strong basis in\nevidence of disparate-impact liability, but it is not so\nrestrictive that it allows employers to act only when there\nis a provable, actual violation.\n   Resolving the statutory conflict in this way allows the\ndisparate-impact prohibition to work in a manner that is\nconsistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the\nprohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores\non the basis of race. See \u00a72000e\u20132(l). Examinations like\nthose administered by the City create legitimate expecta\ntions on the part of those who took the tests. As is the\ncase with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters\nhere invested substantial time, money, and personal\ncommitment in preparing for the tests. Employment tests\ncan be an important part of a neutral selection system\nthat safeguards against the very racial animosities Title\nVII was intended to prevent. Here, however, the firefight\ners saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reli\nance upon race-based statistics.\n   If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candi\ndates\u2019 race, \u00a72000e\u20132(l), then it follows a fortiori that it\nmay not take the greater step of discarding the test alto\ngether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of\npromotion-eligible candidates\u2014absent a strong basis in\nevidence that the test was deficient and that discarding\nthe results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate\nimpact provision. Restricting an employer\u2019s ability to\ndiscard test results (and thereby discriminate against\nqualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in\nkeeping with Title VII\u2019s express protection of bona fide\npromotional examinations. See \u00a72000e\u20132(h) (\u201c[N]or shall\nit be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive and to act upon the results of any professionally\ndeveloped ability test provided that such test, its admini\nstration or action upon the results is not designed, in\ntended or used to discriminate because of race\u201d); cf. AT&T\nCorp. v. Hulteen, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8).\n  For the foregoing reasons, we adopt the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard as a matter of statutory construction to\nresolve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact provisions of Title VII.\n  Our statutory holding does not address the constitution\nality of the measures taken here in purported compliance\nwith Title VII. We also do not hold that meeting the\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard would satisfy the Equal\nProtection Clause in a future case. As we explain below,\nbecause respondents have not met their burden under\nTitle VII, we need not decide whether a legitimate fear of\ndisparate impact is ever sufficient to justify discriminatory\ntreatment under the Constitution.\n  Nor do we question an employer\u2019s affirmative efforts to\nensure that all groups have a fair opportunity to apply for\npromotions and to participate in the process by which\npromotions will be made. But once that process has been\nestablished and employers have made clear their selection\ncriteria, they may not then invalidate the test results,\nthus upsetting an employee\u2019s legitimate expectation not to\nbe judged on the basis of race. Doing so, absent a strong\nbasis in evidence of an impermissible disparate impact,\namounts to the sort of racial preference that Congress has\ndisclaimed, \u00a72000e\u20132(j), and is antithetical to the notion of\na workplace where individuals are guaranteed equal\nopportunity regardless of race.\n  Title VII does not prohibit an employer from consider\ning, before administering a test or practice, how to design\nthat test or practice in order to provide a fair opportunity\nfor all individuals, regardless of their race. And when,\nduring the test-design stage, an employer invites com\n26                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nments to ensure the test is fair, that process can provide a\ncommon ground for open discussions toward that end. We\nhold only that, under Title VII, before an employer can\nengage in intentional discrimination for the asserted\npurpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional dispa\nrate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in\nevidence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact\nliability if it fails to take the race-conscious, discrimina\ntory action.\n                              C\n   The City argues that, even under the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard, its decision to discard the examination\nresults was permissible under Title VII. That is incorrect.\nEven if respondents were motivated as a subjective matter\nby a desire to avoid committing disparate-impact dis\ncrimination, the record makes clear there is no support for\nthe conclusion that respondents had an objective, strong\nbasis in evidence to find the tests inadequate, with some\nconsequent disparate-impact liability in violation of Title\nVII.\n   On this basis, we conclude that petitioners have met\ntheir obligation to demonstrate that there is \u201cno genuine\nissue as to any material fact\u201d and that they are \u201centitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c).\nOn a motion for summary judgment, \u201cfacts must be viewed\nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if\nthere is a \u2018genuine\u2019 dispute as to those facts.\u201d Scott v.\nHarris, 550 U. S. 372, 380 (2007). \u201cWhere the record\ntaken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to\nfind for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for\ntrial.\u201d Matsushita Elec.

In this Court, the City\u2019s only defense is that it\nacted to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provi\nsion. To succeed on their motion, then, petitioners must\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndemonstrate that there can be no genuine dispute that\nthere was no strong basis in evidence for the City to con\nclude it would face disparate-impact liability if it certified\nthe examination results. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU. S. 317, 324 (1986) (where the nonmoving party \u201cwill\nbear the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue,\u201d the\nnonmoving party bears the burden of production under\nRule 56 to \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is\na genuine issue for trial\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n  The racial adverse impact here was significant, and\npetitioners do not dispute that the City was faced with a\nprima facie case of disparate-impact liability. On the\ncaptain exam, the pass rate for white candidates was 64\npercent but was 37.5 percent for both black and Hispanic\ncandidates. On the lieutenant exam, the pass rate for\nwhite candidates was 58.1 percent; for black candidates,\n31.6 percent; and for Hispanic candidates, 20 percent. The\npass rates of minorities, which were approximately one\nhalf the pass rates for white candidates, fall well below the\n80-percent standard set by the EEOC to implement the\ndisparate-impact provision of Title VII. See 29 CFR\n\u00a71607.4(D) (2008) (selection rate that is less than 80 per\ncent \u201cof the rate for the group with the highest rate will\ngenerally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agen\ncies as evidence of adverse impact\u201d); Watson, 487 U. S., at\n995\u2013996, n. 3 (plurality opinion) (EEOC\u2019s 80-percent\nstandard is \u201ca rule of thumb for the courts\u201d). Based on\nhow the passing candidates ranked and an application of\nthe \u201crule of three,\u201d certifying the examinations would have\nmeant that the City could not have considered black can\ndidates for any of the then-vacant lieutenant or captain\npositions.\n  Based on the degree of adverse impact reflected in the\nresults, respondents were compelled to take a hard look at\nthe examinations to determine whether certifying the\n28                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresults would have had an impermissible disparate im\npact. The problem for respondents is that a prima facie\ncase of disparate-impact liability\u2014essentially, a threshold\nshowing of a significant statistical disparity, Connecticut\nv. Teal, 457 U. S. 440, 446 (1982), and nothing more\u2014is\nfar from a strong basis in evidence that the City would\nhave been liable under Title VII had it certified the re\nsults. That is because the City could be liable for dispa\nrate-impact discrimination only if the examinations were\nnot job related and consistent with business necessity, or if\nthere existed an equally valid, less-discriminatory alterna\ntive that served the City\u2019s needs but that the City refused\nto adopt. \u00a72000e\u20132(k)(1)(A), (C). We conclude there is no\nstrong basis in evidence to establish that the test was\ndeficient in either of these respects. We address each of\nthe two points in turn, based on the record developed by\nthe parties through discovery\u2014a record that concentrates\nin substantial part on the statements various witnesses\nmade to the CSB.\n                              1\n  There is no genuine dispute that the examinations were\njob-related and consistent with business necessity. The\nCity\u2019s assertions to the contrary are \u201cblatantly contra\ndicted by the record.\u201d Scott, supra, at 380. The CSB\nheard statements from Chad Legel (the IOS vice presi\ndent) as well as city officials outlining the detailed steps\nIOS took to develop and administer the examinations.\nIOS devised the written examinations, which were the\nfocus of the CSB\u2019s inquiry, after painstaking analyses of\nthe captain and lieutenant positions\u2014analyses in which\nIOS made sure that minorities were overrepresented. And\nIOS drew the questions from source material approved by\nthe Department. Of the outside witnesses who appeared\nbefore the CSB, only one, Vincent Lewis, had reviewed the\nexaminations in any detail, and he was the only one with\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           29\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nany firefighting experience. Lewis stated that the \u201cques\ntions were relevant for both exams.\u201d CA2 App. A1053.\nThe only other witness who had seen any part of the ex\naminations, Christopher Hornick (a competitor of IOS\u2019s),\ncriticized the fact that no one within the Department had\nreviewed the tests\u2014a condition imposed by the City to\nprotect the integrity of the exams in light of past alleged\nsecurity breaches. But Hornick stated that the exams\n\u201cappea[r] to be . . . reasonably good\u201d and recommended that\nthe CSB certify the results. Id., at A1041.\n   Arguing that the examinations were not job-related,\nrespondents note some candidates\u2019 complaints that certain\nexamination questions were contradictory or did not spe\ncifically apply to firefighting practices in New Haven. But\nLegel told the CSB that IOS had addressed those con\ncerns\u2014that it entertained \u201ca handful\u201d of challenges to the\nvalidity of particular examination questions, that it \u201cre\nviewed those challenges and provided feedback [to the\nCity] as to what we thought the best course of action was,\u201d\nand that he could remember at least one question IOS had\nthrown out (\u201coffer[ing] credit to everybody for that particu\nlar question\u201d). Id., at A955\u2013A957. For his part, Hornick\nsaid he \u201csuspect[ed] that some of the criticisms . . . [lev\neled] by candidates\u201d were not valid. Id., at A1035.\n   The City, moreover, turned a blind eye to evidence that\nsupported the exams\u2019 validity. Although the City\u2019s con\ntract with IOS contemplated that IOS would prepare a\ntechnical report consistent with EEOC guidelines for\nexamination-validity studies, the City made no request for\nits report. After the January 2004 meeting between Legel\nand some of the city-official respondents, in which Legel\ndefended the examinations, the City sought no further\ninformation from IOS, save its appearance at a CSB meet\ning to explain how it developed and administered the\nexaminations. IOS stood ready to provide respondents\nwith detailed information to establish the validity of the\n30                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexams, but respondents did not accept that offer.\n                              2\n   Respondents also lacked a strong basis in evidence of an\nequally valid, less-discriminatory testing alternative that\nthe City, by certifying the examination results, would\nnecessarily have refused to adopt. Respondents raise\nthree arguments to the contrary, but each argument fails.\nFirst, respondents refer to testimony before the CSB that\na different composite-score calculation\u2014weighting the\nwritten and oral examination scores 30/70\u2014would have\nallowed the City to consider two black candidates for then\nopen lieutenant positions and one black candidate for\nthen-open captain positions. (The City used a 60/40\nweighting as required by its contract with the New Haven\nfirefighters\u2019 union.) But respondents have produced no\nevidence to show that the 60/40 weighting was indeed\narbitrary. In fact, because that formula was the result of a\nunion-negotiated collective-bargaining agreement, we\npresume the parties negotiated that weighting for a ra\ntional reason. Nor does the record contain any evidence\nthat the 30/70 weighting would be an equally valid way to\ndetermine whether candidates possess the proper mix of\njob knowledge and situational skills to earn promotions.\nChanging the weighting formula, moreover, could well\nhave violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition of altering test scores\non the basis of race. See \u00a72000e\u20132(l). On this record,\nthere is no basis to conclude that a 30/70 weighting was an\nequally valid alternative the City could have adopted.\n   Second, respondents argue that the City could have\nadopted a different interpretation of the \u201crule of three\u201d\nthat would have produced less discriminatory results. The\nrule, in the New Haven city charter, requires the City to\npromote only from \u201cthose applicants with the three high\nest scores\u201d on a promotional examination. New Haven,\nConn., Code of Ordinances, Tit. I, Art. XXX, \u00a7160 (1992).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          31\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nA state court has interpreted the charter to prohibit so\ncalled \u201cbanding\u201d\u2014the City\u2019s previous practice of rounding\nscores to the nearest whole number and considering all\ncandidates with the same whole-number score as being of\none rank. Banding allowed the City to consider three\nranks of candidates (with the possibility of multiple candi\ndates filling each rank) for purposes of the rule of three.\nSee Kelly v. New Haven, No. CV000444614, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">114377</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3 (Conn. Super. Ct., Jan. 9, 2004). Respondents\nclaim that employing banding here would have made four\nblack and one Hispanic candidates eligible for then-open\nlieutenant and captain positions.\n   A state court\u2019s prohibition of banding, as a matter of\nmunicipal law under the charter, may not eliminate band\ning as a valid alternative under Title VII. See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e\u20137. We need not resolve that point, however. Here,\nbanding was not a valid alternative for this reason: Had\nthe City reviewed the exam results and then adopted\nbanding to make the minority test scores appear higher, it\nwould have violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition of adjusting\ntest results on the basis of race. \u00a72000e\u20132(l); see also\nChicago Firefighters Local 2 v. Chicago, 249 F. 3d 649, 656\n(CA7 2001) (Posner, J.) (\u201cWe have no doubt that if banding\nwere adopted in order to make lower black scores seem\nhigher, it would indeed be . . . forbidden\u201d). As a matter of\nlaw, banding was not an alternative available to the City\nwhen it was considering whether to certify the examina\ntion results.\n   Third, and finally, respondents refer to statements by\nHornick in his telephone interview with the CSB regard\ning alternatives to the written examinations. Hornick\nstated his \u201cbelie[f]\u201d that an \u201cassessment center process,\u201d\nwhich would have evaluated candidates\u2019 behavior in typi\ncal job tasks, \u201cwould have demonstrated less adverse\nimpact.\u201d CA2 App. A1039. But Hornick\u2019s brief mention of\nalternative testing methods, standing alone, does not raise\n32                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na genuine issue of material fact that assessment centers\nwere available to the City at the time of the examinations\nand that they would have produced less adverse impact.\nOther statements to the CSB indicated that the Depart\nment could not have used assessment centers for the 2003\nexaminations. Supra, at 14. And although respondents\nlater argued to the CSB that Hornick had pushed the City\nto reject the test results, supra, at 15\u201317, the truth is that\nthe essence of Hornick\u2019s remarks supported its certifying\nthe test results. See Scott, 550 U. S., at 380. Hornick\nstated that adverse impact in standardized testing \u201chas\nbeen in existence since the beginning of testing,\u201d CA2 App.\nA1037, and that the disparity in New Haven\u2019s test results\nwas \u201csomewhat higher but generally in the range that\nwe\u2019ve seen professionally.\u201d Id., at A1030\u2013A1031. He told\nthe CSB he was \u201cnot suggesting\u201d that IOS \u201csomehow\ncreated a test that had adverse impacts that it should not\nhave had.\u201d Id., at A1038. And he suggested that the CSB\nshould \u201ccertify the list as it exists.\u201d Id., at A1041.\n  Especially when it is noted that the strong-basis-in\nevidence standard applies, respondents cannot create a\ngenuine issue of fact based on a few stray (and contradic\ntory) statements in the record. And there is no doubt\nrespondents fall short of the mark by relying entirely on\nisolated statements by Hornick.              Hornick had not\n\u201cstud[ied] the test at length or in detail.\u201d Id., at A1030.\nAnd as he told the CSB, he is a \u201cdirect competitor\u201d of\nIOS\u2019s. Id., at A1029. The remainder of his remarks\nshowed that Hornick\u2019s primary concern\u2014somewhat to the\nfrustration of CSB members\u2014was marketing his services\nfor the future, not commenting on the results of the tests\nthe City had already administered. See, e.g., id., at\nA1026, A1027, A1032, A1036, A1040, A1041. Hornick\u2019s\nhinting had its intended effect: The City has since hired\nhim as a consultant. As for the other outside witnesses\nwho spoke to the CSB, Vincent Lewis (the retired fire\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncaptain) thought the CSB should certify the test results.\nAnd Janet Helms (the Boston College professor) declined\nto review the examinations and told the CSB that, as a\nsociety, \u201cwe need to develop a new way of assessing peo\nple.\u201d Id., at A1073. That task was beyond the reach of the\nCSB, which was concerned with the adequacy of the test\nresults before it.\n                             3\n  On the record before us, there is no genuine dispute that\nthe City lacked a strong basis in evidence to believe it\nwould face disparate-impact liability if it certified the\nexamination results. In other words, there is no evidence\n\u2014let alone the required strong basis in evidence\u2014that the\ntests were flawed because they were not job-related or\nbecause other, equally valid and less discriminatory tests\nwere available to the City. Fear of litigation alone cannot\njustify an employer\u2019s reliance on race to the detriment of\nindividuals who passed the examinations and qualified for\npromotions. The City\u2019s discarding the test results was\nimpermissible under Title VII, and summary judgment is\nappropriate for petitioners on their disparate-treatment\nclaim.\n                          *    *     *\n   The record in this litigation documents a process that, at\nthe outset, had the potential to produce a testing proce\ndure that was true to the promise of Title VII: No individ\nual should face workplace discrimination based on race.\nRespondents thought about promotion qualifications and\nrelevant experience in neutral ways. They were careful to\nensure broad racial participation in the design of the test\nitself and its administration. As we have discussed at\nlength, the process was open and fair.\n   The problem, of course, is that after the tests were\ncompleted, the raw racial results became the predominant\n34                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrationale for the City\u2019s refusal to certify the results. The\ninjury arises in part from the high, and justified, expecta\ntions of the candidates who had participated in the testing\nprocess on the terms the City had established for the\npromotional process. Many of the candidates had studied\nfor months, at considerable personal and financial ex\npense, and thus the injury caused by the City\u2019s reliance on\nraw racial statistics at the end of the process was all the\nmore severe. Confronted with arguments both for and\nagainst certifying the test results\u2014and threats of a law\nsuit either way\u2014the City was required to make a difficult\ninquiry. But its hearings produced no strong evidence of a\ndisparate-impact violation, and the City was not entitled\nto disregard the tests based solely on the racial disparity\nin the results.\n   Our holding today clarifies how Title VII applies to\nresolve competing expectations under the disparate\ntreatment and disparate-impact provisions. If, after it\ncertifies the test results, the City faces a disparate-impact\nsuit, then in light of our holding today it should be clear\nthat the City would avoid disparate-impact liability based\non the strong basis in evidence that, had it not certified\nthe results, it would have been subject to disparate\ntreatment liability.\n   Petitioners are entitled to summary judgment on their\nTitle VII claim, and we therefore need not decide the\nunderlying constitutional question. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

The question is not an easy one. See\ngenerally Primus, Equal Protection and Disparate Impact:\nRound Three, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 493 (2003).\n   The difficulty is this: Whether or not Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-treatment provisions forbid \u201cremedial\u201d race-based\nactions when a disparate-impact violation would not oth\nerwise result\u2014the question resolved by the Court today\u2014\nit is clear that Title VII not only permits but affirmatively\nrequires such actions when a disparate-impact violation\nwould otherwise result. See ante, at 20\u201321. But if the\nFederal Government is prohibited from discriminating on\nthe basis of race, Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 500\n(1954), then surely it is also prohibited from enacting laws\n2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nmandating that third parties\u2014e.g., employers, whether\nprivate, State, or municipal\u2014discriminate on the basis of\nrace. See Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 78\u201382 (1917).\nAs the facts of these cases illustrate, Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact provisions place a racial thumb on the scales, often\nrequiring employers to evaluate the racial outcomes of\ntheir policies, and to make decisions based on (because of)\nthose racial outcomes. That type of racial decisionmaking\nis, as the Court explains, discriminatory. See ante, at 19;\nPersonnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256,\n279 (1979).\n   To be sure, the disparate-impact laws do not mandate\nimposition of quotas, but it is not clear why that should\nprovide a safe harbor. Would a private employer not be\nguilty of unlawful discrimination if he refrained from\nestablishing a racial hiring quota but intentionally de\nsigned his hiring practices to achieve the same end?\nSurely he would. Intentional discrimination is still occur\nring, just one step up the chain. Government compulsion\nof such design would therefore seemingly violate equal\nprotection principles. Nor would it matter that Title VII\nrequires consideration of race on a wholesale, rather than\nretail, level. \u201c[T]he Government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, not as simply components of a racial, reli\ngious, sexual or national class.\u201d Miller v. Johnson, 515\nU. S. 900, 911 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAnd of course the purportedly benign motive for the dispa\nrate-impact provisions cannot save the statute. See Ada\u00ad\nrand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995).\n   It might be possible to defend the law by framing it as\nsimply an evidentiary tool used to identify genuine, inten\ntional discrimination\u2014to \u201csmoke out,\u201d as it were, dispa\nrate treatment. See Primus, supra, at 498\u2013499, 520\u2013521.\nDisparate impact is sometimes (though not always, see\nWatson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U. S. 977, 992\n(1988) (plurality opinion)) a signal of something illicit, so a\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802\u2013803 (1973). But argua\nbly the disparate-impact provisions sweep too broadly to\nbe fairly characterized in such a fashion\u2014since they fail to\nprovide an affirmative defense for good-faith (i.e., nonra\ncially motivated) conduct, or perhaps even for good faith\nplus hiring standards that are entirely reasonable. See\npost, at 15\u201316, and n. 1 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (de\nscribing the demanding nature of the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d\ndefense). This is a question that this Court will have to\nconsider in due course. It is one thing to free plaintiffs\nfrom proving an employer\u2019s illicit intent, but quite another\nto preclude the employer from proving that its motives\nwere pure and its actions reasonable.\n  The Court\u2019s resolution of these cases makes it unneces\nsary to resolve these matters today. But the war between\ndisparate impact and equal protection will be waged\nsooner or later, and it behooves us to begin thinking about\nhow\u2014and on what terms\u2014to make peace between them.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

I write separately only\nbecause the dissent, while claiming that \u201c[t]he Court\u2019s\nrecitation of the facts leaves out important parts of the\nstory,\u201d post, at 2 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.), provides an\nincomplete description of the events that led to New Ha\nven\u2019s decision to reject the results of its exam. The dis\nsent\u2019s omissions are important because, when all of the\nevidence in the record is taken into account, it is clear\nthat, even if the legal analysis in Parts II and III\u2013A of the\ndissent were accepted, affirmance of the decision below is\nuntenable.\n                            I\n  When an employer in a disparate-treatment case under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 claims that an\nemployment decision, such as the refusal to promote, was\nbased on a legitimate reason, two questions\u2014one objective\nand one subjective\u2014must be decided. The first, objective\nquestion is whether the reason given by the employer is\n2                    RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\none that is legitimate under Title VII. See St. Mary\u2019s\nHonor Center v. Hicks, 509 U. S. 502, 506\u2013507 (1993). If\nthe reason provided by the employer is not legitimate on\nits face, the employer is liable. Id., at 509. The second,\nsubjective question concerns the employer\u2019s intent. If an\nemployer offers a facially legitimate reason for its decision\nbut it turns out that this explanation was just a pretext\nfor discrimination, the employer is again liable. See id., at\n510\u2013512.\n   The question on which the opinion of the Court and the\ndissenting opinion disagree concerns the objective compo\nnent of the determination that must be made when an\nemployer justifies an employment decision, like the one\nmade in this litigation, on the ground that a contrary\ndecision would have created a risk of disparate-impact\nliability. The Court holds\u2014and I entirely agree\u2014that\nconcern about disparate-impact liability is a legitimate\nreason for a decision of the type involved here only if there\nwas a \u201csubstantial basis in evidence to find the tests in\nadequate.\u201d Ante, at 26. The Court ably demonstrates that\nin this litigation no reasonable jury could find that the city\nof New Haven (City) possessed such evidence and there\nfore summary judgment for petitioners is required. Be\ncause the Court correctly holds that respondents cannot\nsatisfy this objective component, the Court has no need to\ndiscuss the question of the respondents\u2019 actual intent. As\nthe Court puts it, \u201c[e]ven if respondents were motivated as\na subjective matter by a desire to avoid committing dispa\nrate-impact discrimination, the record makes clear there\nis no support for the conclusion that respondents had an\nobjective, substantial basis in evidence to find the tests\ninadequate.\u201d Ibid.\n   The dissent advocates a different objective component of\nthe governing standard. According to the dissent, the\nobjective component should be whether the evidence pro\nvided \u201cgood cause\u201d for the decision, post, at 19, and the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ndissent argues\u2014incorrectly, in my view\u2014that no reason\nable juror could fail to find that such evidence was present\nhere. But even if the dissent were correct on this point, I\nassume that the dissent would not countenance summary\njudgment for respondents if respondents\u2019 professed con\ncern about disparate-impact litigation was simply a pre\ntext. Therefore, the decision below, which sustained the\nentry of summary judgment for respondents, cannot be\naffirmed unless no reasonable jury could find that the\nCity\u2019s asserted reason for scrapping its test\u2014concern\nabout disparate-impact liability\u2014was a pretext and that\nthe City\u2019s real reason was illegitimate, namely, the desire\nto placate a politically important racial constituency.\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n   As initially described by the dissent, see post, at 2\u201312,\nthe process by which the City reached the decision not to\naccept the test results was open, honest, serious, and\ndeliberative. But even the District Court admitted that \u201ca\njury could rationally infer that city officials worked behind\nthe scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations\nbecause they knew that, were the exams certified, the\nMayor would incur the wrath of [Rev.

In 1996, for example, Mayor DeStefano\ntestified for Rev. Kimber as a character witness when Rev.\nKimber\u2014then the manager of a funeral home\u2014was prose\ncuted and convicted for stealing prepaid funeral expenses\nfrom an elderly woman and then lying about the matter\nunder oath. See id., at 126a, 907a. \u201cReverend Kimber has\nplayed a leadership role in all of Mayor DeStefano\u2019s politi\ncal campaigns, [and] is considered a valuable political\nsupporter and vote-getter.\u201d Id., at 126a. According to the\nMayor\u2019s former campaign manager (who is currently his\nexecutive assistant), Rev. Kimber is an invaluable political\nasset because \u201c[h]e\u2019s very good at organizing people and\nputting together field operations, as a result of his ties to\nlabor, his prominence in the religious community and his\nlong-standing commitment to roots.\u201d Id., at 908a (internal\nquotation marks and alteration omitted).\n  In 2002, the Mayor picked Rev. Kimber to serve as the\nChairman of the New Haven Board of Fire Commissioners\n(BFC), \u201cdespite the fact that he had no experience in the\nprofession, fire administration, [or] municipal manage\nment.\u201d Id., at 127a; see also id., at 928a\u2013929a. In that\ncapacity, Rev.

Id., at 815a\u2013816a. As discussed in further detail\nbelow, Rev. Kimber adamantly opposed certification of the\ntest results\u2014a fact that he or someone in the Mayor\u2019s\noffice eventually conveyed to the Mayor. Id., at 229a.\n                              B\n  On January 12, 2004, Tina Burgett (the director of the\nCity\u2019s Department of Human Resources) sent an e-mail to\nDubois-Walton to coordinate the City\u2019s response to the test\nresults. Burgett wanted to clarify that the City\u2019s executive\nofficials would meet \u201csans the Chief, and that once we had\na better fix on the next steps we would meet with the\nMayor (possibly) and then the two Chiefs.\u201d Id., at 446a.\nThe \u201ctwo Chiefs\u201d are Fire Chief William Grant (who is\nwhite) and Assistant Fire Chief Ronald Dumas (who is\nAfrican-American). Both chiefs believed that the test\nresults should be certified. Id., at 228a, 817a. Petitioners\nallege, and the record suggests, that the Mayor and his\nstaff colluded \u201csans the Chief[s]\u201d because \u201cthe defendants\ndid not want Grant\u2019s or Dumas\u2019 views to be publicly\nknown; accordingly both men were prevented by the\nMayor and his staff from making any statements regard\ning the matter.\u201d Id., at 228a.1\n  The next day, on January 13, 2004, Chad Legel, who\nhad designed the tests, flew from Chicago to New Haven\nto meet with Dubois-Walton, Burgett, and Thomas Ude,\nthe City\u2019s corporate counsel. Id., at 179a. \u201cLegel outlined\nthe merits of the examination and why city officials should\nbe confident in the validity of the results.\u201d Ibid.

Again\naccording to Legel, \u201c[a] theme\u201d of the meeting was \u201cthe\npolitical and racial overtones of what was going on in the\nCity.\u201d Id., at 181a. \u201cLegel came away from the January\n13, 2004 meeting with the impression that defendants\nwere already leaning toward discarding the examination\nresults.\u201d Id., at 180a.\n  On January 22, 2004, the Civil Service Board (CSB or\nBoard) convened its first public meeting. Almost immedi\nately, Rev. Kimber began to exert political pressure on the\nCSB. He began a loud, minutes-long outburst that re\nquired the CSB Chairman to shout him down and hold\nhim out of order three times. See id., at 187a, 467a\u2013468a;\nsee also App. in No. 06\u20134996\u2013cv (CA2), pp. A703\u2013A705.\nReverend Kimber protested the public meeting, arguing\nthat he and the other fire commissioners should first be\nallowed to meet with the CSB in private. App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 07\u20131428, at 188a.\n  Four days after the CSB\u2019s first meeting, Mayor DeSte\nfano\u2019s executive aide sent an e-mail to Dubois-Walton,\nBurgett, and Ude. Id., at 190a. The message clearly\nindicated that the Mayor had made up his mind to oppose\ncertification of the test results (but nevertheless wanted to\nconceal that fact from the public):\n    \u201cI wanted to make sure we are all on the same page\n    for this meeting tomorrow. . . .

But within days of\nmaking that public statement, Ude privately told other\nmembers of the Mayor\u2019s team \u201cthe ONLY way we get to a\ndecision not to certify is\u201d to focus on something other than\n\u201ca big discussion re: adverse impact\u201d law. Id., at 458a\u2013\n459a.\n   As part of its effort to deflect attention from the specifics\nof the test, the City relied heavily on the testimony of Dr.\nChristopher Hornick, who is one of Chad Legel\u2019s competi\ntors in the test-development business. Hornick never\n\u201cstud[ied] the test [that Legel developed] at length or in\ndetail,\u201d id., at 549a; see also id., at 203a, 553a, but Hor\nnick did review and rely upon literature sent to him by\nBurgett to criticize Legel\u2019s test. For example, Hornick\n\u201cnoted in the literature that [Burgett] sent that the test\nwas not customized to the New Haven Fire Department.\u201d\nId., at 551a. The Chairman of the CSB immediately cor\nrected Hornick. Id., at 552a (\u201cActually, it was, Dr. Hor\nnick\u201d). Hornick also relied on newspaper accounts\u2014again,\nsent to him by Burgett\u2014pertaining to the controversy\nsurrounding the certification decision. See id., at 204a,\n557a. Although Hornick again admitted that he had no\nknowledge about the actual test that Legel had developed\nand that the City had administered, see id., at 560a\u2013561a,\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Id., at 819a\u2013820a. Ac\ncordingly, on the evening of March 17th, Dubois-Walton\nsent an e-mail to the Mayor, the Mayor\u2019s executive assis\ntant, Burgett, and attorney Ude, attaching two alternative\npress releases. Id., at 457a. The first would be issued if\nthe CSB voted not to certify the test results; the second\nwould be issued (and would explain the Mayor\u2019s invocation\nof his executive authority) if the CSB voted to certify the\ntest results. Id., at 217a\u2013218a, 590a\u2013591a, 819a\u2013820a.\nHalf an hour after Dubois-Walton circulated the alterna\ntive drafts, Burgett replied: \u201c[W]ell, that seems to say it\nall.

See supra, at 5. While Hornick\nknew little or nothing about the tests he criticized, the two chiefs were\ninvolved \u201cduring the lengthy process that led to the devising of the\nadministration of these exams,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428,\nat 847a, including \u201ccollaborating with City officials on the extensive job\nanalyses that were done,\u201d \u201cselection of the oral panelists,\u201d and selection\nof \u201cthe proper content and subject matter of the exams,\u201d id., at 847a\u2013\n848a.\n10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n  Soon after the CSB voted against certification, Mayor\nDeStefano appeared at a dinner event and \u201ctook credit for\nthe scu[tt]ling of the examination results.\u201d Id., at 230a.\n                              C\n   Taking into account all the evidence in the summary\njudgment record, a reasonable jury could find the follow\ning. Almost as soon as the City disclosed the racial\nmakeup of the list of firefighters who scored the highest on\nthe exam, the City administration was lobbied by an\ninfluential community leader to scrap the test results, and\nthe City administration decided on that course of action\nbefore making any real assessment of the possibility of a\ndisparate-impact violation. To achieve that end, the City\nadministration concealed its internal decision but\nworked\u2014as things turned out, successfully\u2014to persuade\nthe CSB that acceptance of the test results would be ille\ngal and would expose the City to disparate-impact liabil\nity. But in the event that the CSB was not persuaded, the\nMayor, wielding ultimate decisionmaking authority, was\nprepared to overrule the CSB immediately. Taking this\nview of the evidence, a reasonable jury could easily find\nthat the City\u2019s real reason for scrapping the test results\nwas not a concern about violating the disparate-impact\nprovision of Title VII but a simple desire to please a politi\ncally important racial constituency. It is noteworthy that\nthe Solicitor General\u2014whose position on the principal\nlegal issue in this case is largely aligned with the dis\nsent\u2014concludes that \u201c[n]either the district court nor the\ncourt of appeals . . . adequately considered whether, view\ning the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioners,\na genuine issue of material fact remained whether respon\ndents\u2019 claimed purpose to comply with Title VII was a\npretext for intentional racial discrimination . . . .\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 6; see also id., at 32\u2013\n33.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The dissent misrepresents my posi\ntion: I draw no such equation. Of course \u201cthere are many\nways in which a politician can attempt to win over a con\nstituency\u2014including a racial constituency\u2014without en\ngaging in unlawful discrimination.\u201d Post, at 36\u201337. But\u2014\nas I assume the dissent would agree\u2014there are some\nthings that a public official cannot do, and one of those is\nengaging in intentional racial discrimination when mak\ning employment decisions.\n   The second point concerns the dissent\u2019s main argu\nment\u2014that efforts by the Mayor and his staff to scuttle\nthe test results are irrelevant because the ultimate deci\nsion was made by the CSB. According to the dissent,\n\u201c[t]he relevant decision was made by the CSB,\u201d post, at 34,\nand there is \u201cscant cause to suspect\u201d that anything done\nby the opponents of certification, including the Mayor and\nhis staff, \u201cprevented the CSB from evenhandedly assess\ning the reliability of the exams and rendering an inde\npendent, good-faith decision on certification,\u201d post, at 36.\n   Adoption of the dissent\u2019s argument would implicitly\ndecide an important question of Title VII law that this\nCourt has never resolved\u2014the circumstances in which an\nemployer may be held liable based on the discriminatory\nintent of subordinate employees who influence but do not\nmake the ultimate employment decision. There is a large\nbody of court of appeals case law on this issue, and these\ncases disagree about the proper standard. See EEOC v.\nBCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, 450 F. 3d 476,\n484\u2013488 (CA10 2006) (citing cases and describing the\napproaches taken in different Circuits). One standard is\nwhether the subordinate \u201cexerted influenc[e] over the\n12                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\ntitular decisionmaker.\u201d Russell v. McKinney Hosp. Ven\nture, 235 F. 3d 219, 227 (CA5 2000); see also Poland v.\nChertoff, 494 F. 3d 1174, 1182 (CA9 2007) (A subordinate\u2019s\nbias is imputed to the employer where the subordinate\n\u201cinfluenced or was involved in the decision or decision\nmaking process\u201d). Another is whether the discriminatory\ninput \u201ccaused the adverse employment action.\u201d See BCI\nCoca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles, supra, at 487.\n   In the present cases, a reasonable jury could certainly\nfind that these standards were met. The dissent makes\nmuch of the fact that members of the CSB swore under\noath that their votes were based on the good-faith belief\nthat certification of the results would have violated federal\nlaw. See post, at 34. But the good faith of the CSB mem\nbers would not preclude a finding that the presentations\nengineered by the Mayor and his staff influenced or\ncaused the CSB decision.\n   The least employee-friendly standard asks only whether\n\u201cthe actual decisionmaker\u201d acted with discriminatory\nintent, see Hill v. Lockheed Martin Logistics Management,\nInc., 354 F. 3d 277, 291 (CA4 2004) (en banc), and it is\ntelling that, even under this standard, summary judgment\nfor respondents would not be proper. This is so because a\nreasonable jury could certainly find that in New Haven,\nthe Mayor\u2014not the CSB\u2014wielded the final decisionmak\ning power. After all, the Mayor claimed that authority\nand was poised to use it in the event that the CSB decided\nto accept the test results. See supra, at 9. If the Mayor\nhad the authority to overrule a CSB decision accepting the\ntest results, the Mayor also presumably had the authority\nto overrule the CSB\u2019s decision rejecting the test results. In\nlight of the Mayor\u2019s conduct, it would be quite wrong to\nthrow out petitioners\u2019 case on the ground that the CSB\nwas the ultimate decisionmaker.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 327 (2003).\nIn 1972, Congress extended Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 to cover public employment. At that time,\nmunicipal fire departments across the country, including\nNew Haven\u2019s, pervasively discriminated against minori\nties. The extension of Title VII to cover jobs in firefighting\neffected no overnight change. It took decades of persistent\neffort, advanced by Title VII litigation, to open firefighting\nposts to members of racial minorities.\n   The white firefighters who scored high on New Haven\u2019s\npromotional exams understandably attract this Court\u2019s\nsympathy. But they had no vested right to promotion.\nNor have other persons received promotions in preference\nto them. New Haven maintains that it refused to certify\nthe test results because it believed, for good cause, that it\nwould be vulnerable to a Title VII disparate-impact suit if\nit relied on those results. The Court today holds that New\n2                      RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nHaven has not demonstrated \u201ca strong basis in evidence\u201d\nfor its plea. Ante, at 2. In so holding, the Court pretends\nthat \u201c[t]he City rejected the test results solely because the\nhigher scoring candidates were white.\u201d Ante, at 20. That\npretension, essential to the Court\u2019s disposition, ignores\nsubstantial evidence of multiple flaws in the tests New\nHaven used. The Court similarly fails to acknowledge the\nbetter tests used in other cities, which have yielded less\nracially skewed outcomes.1\n   By order of this Court, New Haven, a city in which\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics account for nearly 60\npercent of the population, must today be served\u2014as it was\nin the days of undisguised discrimination\u2014by a fire de\npartment in which members of racial and ethnic minori\nties are rarely seen in command positions. In arriving at\nits order, the Court barely acknowledges the pathmarking\ndecision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971),\nwhich explained the centrality of the disparate-impact\nconcept to effective enforcement of Title VII. The Court\u2019s\norder and opinion, I anticipate, will not have staying\npower.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Court\u2019s recitation of the facts leaves out important\nparts of the story. Firefighting is a profession in which the\nlegacy of racial discrimination casts an especially long\nshadow. In extending Title VII to state and local govern\nment employers in 1972, Congress took note of a U. S.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Never\n          mind the flawed tests New Haven used and the better selec\ntion methods used elsewhere, JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concurring opinion urges.\nOverriding all else, racial politics, fired up by a strident African-\nAmerican pastor, were at work in New Haven. See ante, at 4\u20139. Even\na detached and disinterested observer, however, would have every\nreason to ask: Why did such racially skewed results occur in New\nHaven, when better tests likely would have produced less dispropor\ntionate results?\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

R. Rep. No. 92\u2013\n238, p. 17 (1971). According to the report, overt racism\nwas partly to blame, but so too was a failure on the part of\nmunicipal employers to apply merit-based employment\nprinciples. In making hiring and promotion decisions,\npublic employers often \u201crel[ied] on criteria unrelated to job\nperformance,\u201d including nepotism or political patronage.\n118 Cong. Rec. 1817 (1972). Such flawed selection meth\nods served to entrench preexisting racial hierarchies. The\nUSCCR report singled out police and fire departments for\nhaving \u201c[b]arriers to equal employment . . . greater . . .\nthan in any other area of State or local government,\u201d with\nAfrican-Americans \u201chold[ing] almost no positions in the\nofficer ranks.\u201d Ibid.

In the\nearly 1970\u2019s, African-Americans and Hispanics composed\n30 percent of New Haven\u2019s population, but only 3.6 per\ncent of the City\u2019s 502 firefighters.

New Haven\u2019s population includes a greater pro\nportion of minorities today than it did in the 1970\u2019s:\nNearly 40 percent of the City\u2019s residents are African\n4                   RICCI v.

Among\nentry-level firefighters, minorities are still underrepre\nsented, but not starkly so. As of 2003, African-Americans\nand Hispanics constituted 30 percent and 16 percent of the\nCity\u2019s firefighters, respectively. In supervisory positions,\nhowever, significant disparities remain. Overall, the\nsenior officer ranks (captain and higher) are nine percent\nAfrican-American and nine percent Hispanic. Only one of\nthe Department\u2019s 21 fire captains is African-American.\nSee App. in No. 06\u20134996\u2013cv (CA2), p. A1588 (hereinafter\nCA2 App.). It is against this backdrop of entrenched\ninequality that the promotion process at issue in this\nlitigation should be assessed.\n                             B\n   By order of its charter, New Haven must use competi\ntive examinations to fill vacancies in fire officer and other\ncivil-service positions. Such examinations, the City\u2019s civil\nservice rules specify, \u201cshall be practical in nature, shall\nrelate to matters which fairly measure the relative fitness\nand capacity of the applicants to discharge the duties of\nthe position which they seek, and shall take into account\ncharacter, training, experience, physical and mental fit\nness.\u201d Id., at A331. The City may choose among a variety\nof testing methods, including written and oral exams and\n\u201c[p]erformance tests to demonstrate skill and ability in\nperforming actual work.\u201d Id., at A332.\n   New Haven, the record indicates, did not closely con\nsider what sort of \u201cpractical\u201d examination would \u201cfairly\nmeasure the relative fitness and capacity of the applicants\nto discharge the duties\u201d of a fire officer. Instead, the City\nsimply adhered to the testing regime outlined in its two\ndecades-old contract with the local firefighters\u2019 union: a\nwritten exam, which would account for 60 percent of an\napplicant\u2019s total score, and an oral exam, which would\naccount for the remaining 40 percent.

Chad Legel, a representative of the\nwinning bidder, Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc.\n(IOS), testified during his deposition that the City never\nasked whether alternative methods might better measure\nthe qualities of a successful fire officer, including leader\nship skills and command presence. See id., at A522 (\u201cI\nwas under contract and had responsibility only to create\nthe oral interview and the written exam.\u201d).\n   Pursuant to New Haven\u2019s specifications, IOS developed\nand administered the oral and written exams. The results\nshowed significant racial disparities. On the lieutenant\nexam, the pass rate for African-American candidates was\nabout one-half the rate for Caucasian candidates; the pass\nrate for Hispanic candidates was even lower. On the\ncaptain exam, both African-American and Hispanic candi\ndates passed at about half the rate of their Caucasian\ncounterparts. See App. 225\u2013226. More striking still,\nalthough nearly half of the 77 lieutenant candidates were\nAfrican-American or Hispanic, none would have been\neligible for promotion to the eight positions then vacant.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n13th; the top Hispanic candidate was 26th. As for the\nseven then-vacant captain positions, two Hispanic candi\ndates would have been eligible, but no African-Americans.\nThe highest scoring African-American candidate ranked\n15th. See id., at 218\u2013219.\n   These stark disparities, the Court acknowledges, suf\nficed to state a prima facie case under Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-impact provision. See ante, at 27 (\u201cThe pass rates of\nminorities . . . f[e]ll well below the 80-percent standard set\nby the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC)] to implement the disparate-impact provision of\n6                   RICCI v.

At the first\nmeeting, New Haven\u2019s Corporation Counsel, Thomas Ude,\ndescribed the legal standard governing Title VII disparate\nimpact claims. Statistical imbalances alone, Ude correctly\nrecognized, do not give rise to liability. Instead, presented\nwith a disparity, an employer \u201chas the opportunity and the\nburden of proving that the test is job-related and consis\ntent with business necessity.\u201d CA2 App. A724. A Title VII\nplaintiff may attempt to rebut an employer\u2019s showing of\njob-relatedness and necessity by identifying alternative\nselection methods that would have been at least as valid\nbut with \u201cless of an adverse or disparate or discriminatory\neffect.\u201d Ibid. See also id., at A738. Accordingly, the CSB\nCommissioners understood, their principal task was to\ndecide whether they were confident about the reliability of\nthe exams: Had the exams fairly measured the qualities of\na successful fire officer despite their disparate results?\nMight an alternative examination process have identified\nthe most qualified candidates without creating such sig\nnificant racial imbalances?\n   Seeking a range of input on these questions, the CSB\nheard from test takers, the test designer, subject-matter\nexperts, City officials, union leaders, and community\nmembers. Several candidates for promotion, who did not\nyet know their exam results, spoke at the CSB\u2019s first two\nmeetings. Some candidates favored certification. The\nexams, they emphasized, had closely tracked the assigned\nstudy materials. Having invested substantial time and\nmoney to prepare themselves for the test, they felt it\nwould be unfair to scrap the results. See, e.g., id., at\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nA772\u2013A773, A785\u2013A789.\n   Other firefighters had a different view. A number of the\nexam questions, they pointed out, were not germane to\nNew Haven\u2019s practices and procedures. See, e.g., id., at\nA774\u2013A784. At least two candidates opposed to certifica\ntion noted unequal access to study materials. Some indi\nviduals, they asserted, had the necessary books even\nbefore the syllabus was issued. Others had to invest\nsubstantial sums to purchase the materials and \u201cwait a\nmonth and a half for some of the books because they were\non back-order.\u201d Id., at A858. These disparities, it was\nsuggested, fell at least in part along racial lines. While\nmany Caucasian applicants could obtain materials and\nassistance from relatives in the fire service, the over\nwhelming majority of minority applicants were \u201cfirst\ngeneration firefighters\u201d without such support networks.\nSee id., at A857\u2013A861, A886\u2013A887.\n   A representative of the Northeast Region of the Interna\ntional Association of Black Professional Firefighters,\nDonald Day, also spoke at the second meeting. Statistical\ndisparities, he told the CSB, had been present in the\nDepartment\u2019s previous promotional exams. On earlier\ntests, however, a few minority candidates had fared well\nenough to earn promotions. Id., at A828. See also App.\n218\u2013219. Day contrasted New Haven\u2019s experience with\nthat of nearby Bridgeport, where minority firefighters held\none-third of lieutenant and captain positions. Bridgeport,\nDay observed, had once used a testing process similar to\nNew Haven\u2019s, with a written exam accounting for 70\npercent of an applicant\u2019s score, an oral exam for 25 per\ncent, and seniority for the remaining five percent. CA2\nApp. A830. Bridgeport recognized, however, that the oral\ncomponent, more so than the written component, ad\ndressed the sort of \u201creal-life scenarios\u201d fire officers encoun\nter on the job. Id., at A832. Accordingly, that city\n\u201cchanged the relative weights\u201d to give primacy to the oral\n8                   RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nexam. Ibid. Since that time, Day reported, Bridgeport\nhad seen minorities \u201cfairly represented\u201d in its exam re\nsults. Ibid.\n   The CSB\u2019s third meeting featured IOS representative\nLegel, the leader of the team that had designed and ad\nministered the exams for New Haven. Several City offi\ncials also participated in the discussion. Legel described\nthe exam development process in detail. The City, he\nrecounted, had set the \u201cparameters\u201d for the exams, specifi\ncally, the requirement of written and oral components\nwith a 60/40 weighting. Id., at A923, A974. For security\nreasons, Department officials had not been permitted to\ncheck the content of the questions prior to their admini\nstration. Instead, IOS retained a senior fire officer from\nGeorgia to review the exams \u201cfor content and fidelity to\nthe source material.\u201d Id., at A936. Legel defended the\nexams as \u201cfacially neutral,\u201d and stated that he \u201cwould\nstand by the[ir] validity.\u201d Id., at A962. City officials did\nnot dispute the neutrality of IOS\u2019s work. But, they cau\ntioned, even if individual exam questions had no intrinsic\nbias, the selection process as a whole may nevertheless\nhave been deficient. The officials urged the CSB to consult\nwith experts about the \u201clarger picture.\u201d Id., at A1012.\n   At its fourth meeting, CSB solicited the views of three\nindividuals with testing-related expertise. Dr. Christo\npher Hornick, an industrial/organizational psychology\nconsultant with 25 years\u2019 experience with police and fire\nfighter testing, described the exam results as having\n\u201crelatively high adverse impact.\u201d Id., at A1028. Most of\nthe tests he had developed, Hornick stated, exhibited\n\u201csignificantly and dramatically less adverse impact.\u201d Id.,\nat A1029. Hornick downplayed the notion of \u201cfacial neu\ntrality.\u201d It was more important, he advised the CSB, to\nconsider \u201cthe broader issue of how your procedures and\nyour rules and the types of tests that you are using are\ncontributing to the adverse impact.\u201d Id., at A1038.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n    Specifically, Hornick questioned New Haven\u2019s union\nprompted 60/40 written/oral examination structure, noting\nthe availability of \u201cdifferent types of testing procedures\nthat are much more valid in terms of identifying the best\npotential supervisors in [the] fire department.\u201d Id., at\nA1032. He suggested, for example, \u201can assessment center\nprocess, which is essentially an opportunity for candidates\n. . . to demonstrate how they would address a particular\nproblem as opposed to just verbally saying it or identifying\nthe correct option on a written test.\u201d Id., at A1039\u2013A1040.\nSuch selection processes, Hornick said, better \u201cidentif[y]\nthe best possible people\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate dramatically\nless adverse impacts.\u201d Ibid. Hornick added:\n    \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to at least 10,000, maybe 15,000 fire\n    fighters in group settings in my consulting practice\n    and I have never one time ever had anyone in the fire\n    service say to me, \u2018Well, the person who answers\u2014\n    gets the highest score on a written job knowledge,\n    multiple-guess test makes the best company officer.\u2019\n    We know that it\u2019s not as valid as other procedures\n    that exist.\u201d Id., at A1033.\nSee also id., at A1042\u2013A1043 (\u201cI think a person\u2019s leader\nship skills, their command presence, their interpersonal\nskills, their management skills, their tactical skills could\nhave been identified and evaluated in a much more appro\npriate way.\u201d).\n   Hornick described the written test itself as \u201creasonably\ngood,\u201d id., at A1041, but he criticized the decision not to\nallow Department officials to check the content. According\nto Hornick, this \u201cinevitably\u201d led to \u201ctest[ing] for processes\nand procedures that don\u2019t necessarily match up into the\ndepartment.\u201d Id., at A1034\u2013A1035. He preferred \u201cexperts\nfrom within the department who have signed confidential\nity agreements . . . to make sure that the terminology and\nequipment that\u2019s being identified from standardized read\n10                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ning sources apply to the department.\u201d Id., at A1035.\n   Asked whether he thought the City should certify the\nresults, Hornick hedged: \u201cThere is adverse impact in the\ntest. That will be identified in any proceeding that you\nhave. You will have industrial psychology experts, if it\ngoes to court, on both sides. And it will not be a pretty or\ncomfortable position for anyone to be in.\u201d Id., at A1040\u2013\nA1041. Perhaps, he suggested, New Haven might certify\nthe results but immediately begin exploring \u201calternative\nways to deal with these issues\u201d in the future. Id., at\nA1041.\n   The two other witnesses made relatively brief appear\nances. Vincent Lewis, a specialist with the Department of\nHomeland Security and former fire officer in Michigan,\nbelieved the exams had generally tested relevant material,\nalthough he noted a relatively heavy emphasis on ques\ntions pertaining to being an \u201capparatus driver.\u201d He sug\ngested that this may have disadvantaged test takers \u201cwho\nhad not had the training or had not had an opportunity to\ndrive the apparatus.\u201d Id., at A1051. He also urged the\nCSB to consider whether candidates had, in fact, enjoyed\nequal access to the study materials. Ibid. Cf. supra, at 7.\n   Janet Helms, a professor of counseling psychology at\nBoston College, observed that two-thirds of the incumbent\nfire officers who submitted job analyses to IOS during the\nexam design phase were Caucasian. Members of different\nracial groups, Helms told the CSB, sometimes do their jobs\nin different ways, \u201coften because the experiences that are\nopen to white male firefighters are not open to members of\nthese other under-represented groups.\u201d CA2 App. A1063\u2013\nA1064. The heavy reliance on job analyses from white\nfirefighters, she suggested, may thus have introduced an\nelement of bias. Id., at A1063.\n   The CSB\u2019s fifth and final meeting began with state\nments from City officials recommending against certifica\ntion. Ude, New Haven\u2019s counsel, repeated the applicable\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Where a\n    procedure demonstrates adverse impact, you look to\n    how closely it is related to the job that you\u2019re looking\n    to fill and you also look at whether there are other\n    ways to test for those qualities, those traits, those po\n    sitions that are equally valid with less adverse im\n    pact.\u201d Id., at A1100\u2013A1101.\nNew Haven, Ude and other officials asserted, would be\nvulnerable to Title VII liability under this standard. Even\nif the exams were \u201cfacially neutral,\u201d significant doubts had\nbeen raised about whether they properly assessed the key\nattributes of a successful fire officer. Id., at A1103. See\nalso id., at A1125 (\u201cUpon close reading of the exams, the\nquestions themselves would appear to test a candidate\u2019s\nability to memorize textbooks but not necessarily to iden\ntify solutions to real problems on the fire ground.\u201d). More\nover, City officials reminded the CSB, Hornick and others\nhad identified better, less discriminatory selection meth\nods\u2013such as assessment centers or exams with a more\nheavily weighted oral component. Id., at A1108\u2013A1109,\nA1129\u2013A1130.\n   After giving members of the public a final chance to\nweigh in, the CSB voted on certification, dividing 2 to 2.\nBy rule, the result was noncertification. Voting no, Com\nmissioner Webber stated, \u201cI originally was going to vote to\ncertify. . . . But I\u2019ve heard enough testimony here to give\nme great doubts about the test itself and . . . some of the\nprocedures. And I believe we can do better.\u201d Id., at\nA1157. Commissioner Tirado likewise concluded that the\n\u201cflawed\u201d testing process counseled against certification.\nId., at A1158. Chairman Segaloff and Commissioner\nCaplan voted to certify. According to Segaloff, the testi\nmony had not \u201ccompelled [him] to say this exam was not\n12                  RICCI v.

Both Segalhoff and Caplan, however,\nurged the City to undertake civil service reform. Id., at\nA1150\u2013A1154.\n                                C\n   Following the CSB\u2019s vote, petitioners\u201417 white fire\nfighters and one Hispanic firefighter, all of whom had high\nmarks on the exams\u2014filed suit in the United States Dis\ntrict Court for the District of Connecticut. They named as\ndefendants\u2014respondents here\u2014the City, several City\nofficials, a local political activist, and the two CSB mem\nbers who voted against certifying the results. By opposing\ncertification, petitioners alleged, respondents had dis\ncriminated against them in violation of Title VII\u2019s dispa\nrate-treatment provision and the Fourteenth Amend\nment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. The decision not to\ncertify, respondents answered, was a lawful effort to com\nply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provision and thus\ncould not have run afoul of Title VII\u2019s prohibition of dispa\nrate treatment. Characterizing respondents\u2019 stated ra\ntionale as a mere pretext, petitioners insisted that New\nHaven would have had a solid defense to any disparate\nimpact suit.\n   In a decision summarily affirmed by the Court of Ap\npeals, the District Court granted summary judgment for\nrespondents. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. 2d, at 158.\nHad New Haven gone forward with certification and been\nsued by aggrieved minority test takers, the City would\nhave been forced to defend tests that were presumptively\ninvalid. And, as the CSB testimony of Hornick and others\nindicated, overcoming that presumption would have been\nno easy task. Id., at 153\u2013156. Given Title VII\u2019s preference\nfor voluntary compliance, the court held, New Haven could\nlawfully discard the disputed exams even if the City had\nnot definitively \u201cpinpoint[ed]\u201d the source of the disparity\nand \u201cha[d] not yet formulated a better selection method.\u201d\nId., at 156.\n  Respondents were no doubt conscious of race during\ntheir decisionmaking process, the court acknowledged, but\nthis did not mean they had engaged in racially disparate\ntreatment. The conclusion they had reached and the\naction thereupon taken were race-neutral in this sense:\n\u201c[A]ll the test results were discarded, no one was pro\nmoted, and firefighters of every race will have to partici\npate in another selection process to be considered for\npromotion.\u201d Id., at 158. New Haven\u2019s action, which gave\nno individual a preference, \u201cwas \u2018simply not analogous to a\nquota system or a minority set-aside where candidates, on\nthe basis of their race, are not treated uniformly.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n157 (quoting Hayden, 180 F. 3d, at 50). For these and\nother reasons, the court also rejected petitioners\u2019 equal\nprotection claim.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  Title VII became effective in July 1965.

Congress, the\nlandmark decision recognized, aimed beyond \u201cdisparate\ntreatment\u201d; it targeted \u201cdisparate impact\u201d as well. Title\nVII\u2019s original text, it was plain to the Court, \u201cproscribe[d]\nnot only overt discrimination but also practices that are\nfair in form, but discriminatory in operation.\u201d Id., at 431.2\nOnly by ignoring Griggs could one maintain that inten\ntionally disparate treatment alone was Title VII\u2019s \u201corigi\nnal, foundational prohibition,\u201d and disparate impact a\nmere afterthought.

Cf. ante, at\n20. Standing on an equal footing, these twin pillars of\nTitle VII advance the same objectives: ending workplace\ndiscrimination and promoting genuinely equal opportu\nnity. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S.\n792, 800 (1973).\n   Yet the Court today sets at odds the statute\u2019s core direc\ntives. When an employer changes an employment practice\nin an effort to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact\nprovision, the Court reasons, it acts \u201cbecause of race\u201d\u2014\nsomething Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment provision, see\n\u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1), generally forbids.

Here, Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment\nand disparate-impact proscriptions must be read as\ncomplementary.\n  In codifying the Griggs and Albemarle instructions,\nCongress declared unambiguously that selection criteria\noperating to the disadvantage of minority group members\ncan be retained only if justified by business necessity.5 In\nkeeping with Congress\u2019 design, employers who reject such\ncriteria due to reasonable doubts about their reliability\ncan hardly be held to have engaged in discrimination\n\u201cbecause of\u201d race. A reasonable endeavor to comply with\nthe law and to ensure that qualified candidates of all races\nhave a fair opportunity to compete is simply not what\nCongress meant to interdict. I would therefore hold that\nan employer who jettisons a selection device when its\ndisproportionate racial impact becomes apparent does not\nviolate Title VII\u2019s disparate-treatment bar automatically\nor at all, subject to this key condition: The employer must\nhave good cause to believe the device would not withstand\nexamination for business necessity.

Neither the Court nor the concurring\nopinions attempt to defend the ratio.\n20                  RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nunder Title VII, we have previously accorded the Commis\nsion\u2019s position respectful consideration. See, e.g., Albe\u00ad\nmarle, 422 U. S., at 431; Griggs, 401 U. S., at 434. Yet the\nCourt today does not so much as mention EEOC\u2019s counsel.\n   Our precedents defining the contours of Title VII\u2019s\ndisparate-treatment prohibition further confirm the ab\nsence of any intra-statutory discord. In Johnson v. Trans\u00ad\nportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616 (1987),\nwe upheld a municipal employer\u2019s voluntary affirmative\naction plan against a disparate-treatment challenge.\nPursuant to the plan, the employer selected a woman for a\nroad-dispatcher position, a job category traditionally\nregarded as \u201cmale.\u201d A male applicant who had a slightly\nhigher interview score brought suit under Title VII. This\nCourt rejected his claim and approved the plan, which\nallowed consideration of gender as \u201cone of numerous fac\ntors.\u201d Id., at 638. Such consideration, we said, is \u201cfully\nconsistent with Title VII\u201d because plans of that order can\naid \u201cin eliminating the vestiges of discrimination in the\nworkplace.\u201d Id., at 642.\n   This litigation does not involve affirmative action. But\nif the voluntary affirmative action at issue in Johnson\ndoes not discriminate within the meaning of Title VII,\nneither does an employer\u2019s reasonable effort to comply\nwith Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provision by refrain-\ning from action of doubtful consistency with business\nnecessity.\n                            C\n  To \u201creconcile\u201d the supposed \u201cconflict\u201d between disparate\ntreatment and disparate impact, the Court offers an enig\nmatic standard. Ante, at 20. Employers may attempt to\ncomply with Title VII\u2019s disparate-impact provision, the\nCourt declares, only where there is a \u201cstrong basis in\nevidence\u201d documenting the necessity of their action. Ante,\nat 22. The Court\u2019s standard, drawn from inapposite equal\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nprotection precedents, is not elaborated. One is left to\nwonder what cases would meet the standard and why the\nCourt is so sure this case does not.\n                              1\n   In construing Title VII, I note preliminarily, equal\nprotection doctrine is of limited utility. The Equal Protec\ntion Clause, this Court has held, prohibits only intentional\ndiscrimination; it does not have a disparate-impact com\nponent. See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney,\n442 U. S. 256, 272 (1979); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.\n229, 239 (1976). Title VII, in contrast, aims to eliminate\nall forms of employment discrimination, unintentional as\nwell as deliberate. Until today, cf. ante, at 25; ante, p. 1\n(SCALIA, J., concurring), this Court has never questioned\nthe constitutionality of the disparate-impact component of\nTitle VII, and for good reason. By instructing employers\nto avoid needlessly exclusionary selection processes, Title\nVII\u2019s disparate-impact provision calls for a \u201crace-neutral\nmeans to increase minority . . . participation\u201d\u2014something\nthis Court\u2019s equal protection precedents also encourage.\nSee Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 238\n(1995) (quoting Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.\n469, 507 (1989)). \u201cThe very radicalism of holding dispa\nrate impact doctrine unconstitutional as a matter of equal\nprotection,\u201d moreover, \u201csuggests that only a very uncom\npromising court would issue such a decision.\u201d Primus,\nEqual Protection and Disparate Impact: Round Three, 117\nHarv. L. Rev. 493, 585 (2003).\n   The cases from which the Court draws its strong-basis\nin-evidence standard are particularly inapt; they concern\nthe constitutionality of absolute racial preferences. See\nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277 (1986)\n(plurality opinion) (invalidating a school district\u2019s plan to\nlay off nonminority teachers while retaining minority\nteachers with less seniority); Croson, 488 U. S., at 499\u2013500\n22                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n(rejecting a set-aside program for minority contractors\nthat operated as \u201can unyielding racial quota\u201d). An em\nployer\u2019s effort to avoid Title VII liability by repudiating a\nsuspect selection method scarcely resembles those cases.\nRace was not merely a relevant consideration in Wygant\nand Croson; it was the decisive factor. Observance of Title\nVII\u2019s disparate-impact provision, in contrast, calls for no\nracial preference, absolute or otherwise. The very purpose\nof the provision is to ensure that individuals are hired and\npromoted based on qualifications manifestly necessary to\nsuccessful performance of the job in question, qualifica\ntions that do not screen out members of any race.6\n                             2\n  The Court\u2019s decision in this litigation underplays a\ndominant Title VII theme. This Court has repeatedly\nemphasized that the statute \u201cshould not be read to\nthwart\u201d efforts at voluntary compliance. Johnson, 480\nU. S., at 630. Such compliance, we have explained, is \u201cthe\npreferred means of achieving [Title VII\u2019s] objectives.\u201d\nFirefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 515 (1986). See\nalso Kolstad v. American Dental Assn., 527 U. S. 526, 545\n(1999) (\u201cDissuading employers from [taking voluntary\naction] to prevent discrimination in the workplace is di\nrectly contrary to the purposes underlying Title VII.\u201d); 29\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Even in Title VII cases involving race-conscious (or gender\n\nconscious) affirmative-action plans, the Court has never proposed a\nstrong-basis-in-evidence standard.      In Johnson v. Transportation\nAgency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616 (1987), the Court simply\nexamined the municipal employer\u2019s action for reasonableness: \u201cGiven\nthe obvious imbalance in the Skilled Craft category, and given the\nAgency\u2019s commitment to eliminating such imbalances, it was plainly\nnot unreasonable for the Agency . . . to consider as one factor the sex of\n[applicants] in making its decision.\u201d Id., at 637. See also Firefighters v.\nCleveland, 478 U. S. 501, 516 (1986) (\u201cTitle VII permits employers and\nunions voluntarily to make use of reasonable race-conscious affirmative\naction.\u201d).\n                    Cite as: 557 U.

The strong-basis-in-evidence standard,\nhowever, as barely described in general, and cavalierly\napplied in this case, makes voluntary compliance a haz\nardous venture.\n   As a result of today\u2019s decision, an employer who discards\na dubious selection process can anticipate costly disparate\ntreatment litigation in which its chances for success\u2014even\nfor surviving a summary-judgment motion\u2014are highly\nproblematic. Concern about exposure to disparate-impact\nliability, however well grounded, is insufficient to insulate\nan employer from attack. Instead, the employer must\nmake a \u201cstrong\u201d showing that (1) its selection method was\n\u201cnot job related and consistent with business necessity,\u201d or\n(2) that it refused to adopt \u201can equally valid, less\ndiscriminatory alternative.\u201d Ante, at 28. It is hard to see\nhow these requirements differ from demanding that an\nemployer establish \u201ca provable, actual violation\u201d against\nitself. Cf. ante, at 24. There is indeed a sharp conflict\nhere, but it is not the false one the Court describes be\ntween Title VII\u2019s core provisions. It is, instead, the discor\ndance of the Court\u2019s opinion with the voluntary compli\nance ideal. Cf. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 290 (O\u2019Connor, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cThe\nimposition of a requirement that public employers make\nfindings that they have engaged in illegal discrimina-\ntion before they [act] would severely undermine public\nemployers\u2019 incentive to meet voluntarily their civil rights\nobligations.\u201d).7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Notably,prior decisions applying a strong-basis-in-evidence stan\ndard have not imposed a burden as heavy as the one the Court imposes\ntoday. In Croson, the Court found no strong basis in evidence because\nthe City had offered \u201cnothing approaching a prima facie case.\u201d Rich\u00ad\nmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 500 (1989). The Court did not\nsuggest that anything beyond a prima facie case would have been\nrequired. In the context of race-based electoral districting, the Court\nhas indicated that a \u201cstrong basis\u201d exists when the \u201cthreshold condi\n24                       RICCI v.

This\nrationale puts the cart before the horse. The legitimacy of\nan employee\u2019s expectation depends on the legitimacy of the\nselection method. If an employer reasonably concludes\nthat an exam fails to identify the most qualified individu\nals and needlessly shuts out a segment of the applicant\npool, Title VII surely does not compel the employer to hire\nor promote based on the test, however unreliable it may\nbe. Indeed, the statute\u2019s prime objective is to prevent\nexclusionary practices from \u201coperat[ing] to \u2018freeze\u2019 the\nstatus quo.\u201d Griggs, 401 U. S., at 430.\n  Second, the Court suggests, anything less than a strong\nbasis-in-evidence standard risks creating \u201ca de facto quota\nsystem, in which . . . an employer could discard test re\nsults . . . with the intent of obtaining the employer\u2019s pre\nferred racial balance.\u201d Ante, at 22. Under a reasonable\nness standard, however, an employer could not cast aside\na selection method based on a statistical disparity alone.8\nThe employer must have good cause to believe that the\nmethod screens out qualified applicants and would be\ndifficult to justify as grounded in business necessity.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntions\u201d for liability are present. Bush v. Vera, 517 U.

See also ante, at 20, 27\u201328. But as the part of the story the\nCourt leaves out, see supra, at 2\u201312, so plainly shows\u2014the long history\nof rank discrimination against African-Americans in the firefighting\nprofession, the multiple flaws in New Haven\u2019s test for promotions\u2014\n\u201csole reliance\u201d on statistics certainly is not descriptive of the CSB\u2019s\ndecision.\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

When this Court formulates a\nnew legal rule, the ordinary course is to remand and allow\nthe lower courts to apply the rule in the first instance.\nSee, e.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 515 (2005);\nPullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 291 (1982). I\nsee no good reason why the Court fails to follow that\ncourse in this case. Indeed, the sole basis for the Court\u2019s\nperemptory ruling is the demonstrably false pretension\nthat respondents showed \u201cnothing more\u201d than \u201ca signifi\ncant statistical disparity.\u201d Ante, at 27\u201328; see supra, at\n24, n. 8. 9\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The  Court\u2019s refusal to remand for further proceedings also deprives\nrespondents of an opportunity to invoke 42 U.

Section 2000e\u201312(b) provides:\n\u201cIn any action or proceeding based on any alleged unlawful employment\npractice, no person shall be subject to any liability or punishment for or\non account of (1) the commission by such person of an unlawful em\nployment practice if he pleads and proves that the act or omission\ncomplained of was in good faith, in conformity with, and in reliance on\nany written interpretation or opinion of the [EEOC] . . . .

If \u201caffirmative action\u201d is in order, so\nis the lesser step of discarding a dubious selection device.\n26                       RICCI v.

Judged by that stan\ndard, petitioners have not shown that New Haven\u2019s failure\nto certify the exam results violated Title VII\u2019s disparate\ntreatment provision.10\n   The City, all agree, \u201cwas faced with a prima facie case of\ndisparate-impact liability,\u201d ante, at 27: The pass rate for\nminority candidates was half the rate for nonminority\ncandidates, and virtually no minority candidates would\nhave been eligible for promotion had the exam results\nbeen certified. Alerted to this stark disparity, the CSB\nheard expert and lay testimony, presented at public hear\nings, in an endeavor to ascertain whether the exams were\nfair and consistent with business necessity. Its investiga\ntion revealed grave cause for concern about the exam\nprocess itself and the City\u2019s failure to consider alternative\nselection devices.\n   Chief among the City\u2019s problems was the very nature of\nthe tests for promotion. In choosing to use written and\noral exams with a 60/40 weighting, the City simply ad\nhered to the union\u2019s preference and apparently gave no\nconsideration to whether the weighting was likely to\nidentify the most qualified fire-officer candidates.11 There\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The lower courts focused on respondents\u2019 \u201cintent\u201d rather than on\n\nwhether respondents in fact had good cause to act.

But the Court has seen fit to preclude further\nproceedings. I therefore explain why, if final adjudication by this Court\nis indeed appropriate, New Haven should be the prevailing party.\n   11 This alone would have posed a substantial problem for New Haven\n\nin a disparate-impact suit, particularly in light of the disparate results\nthe City\u2019s scheme had produced in the past.

These qualities are not well measured by written\ntests. Testifying before the CSB, Christopher Hornick, an\nexam-design expert with more than two decades of rele\nvant experience, was emphatic on this point: Leadership\nskills, command presence, and the like \u201ccould have been\nidentified and evaluated in a much more appropriate\nway.\u201d Id., at A1042\u2013A1043.\n   Hornick\u2019s commonsense observation is mirrored in case\nlaw and in Title VII\u2019s administrative guidelines. Courts\nhave long criticized written firefighter promotion exams\nfor being \u201cmore probative of the test-taker\u2019s ability to\nrecall what a particular text stated on a given topic than\nof his firefighting or supervisory knowledge and abilities.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nUniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (Uniform\nGuidelines), employers must conduct \u201can investigation of suitable\nalternative selection procedures.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a71607.3(B).

Although compre\nhensive statistics are scarce, a 1996 study found that\nnearly two-thirds of surveyed municipalities used assess\nment centers (\u201csimulations of the real world of work\u201d) as\npart of their promotion processes. P. Lowry, A Survey of\nthe Assessment Center Process in the Public Sector, 25\nPublic Personnel Management 307, 315 (1996). That\nfigure represented a marked increase over the previous\ndecade, see ibid., so the percentage today may well be even\nhigher. Among municipalities still relying in part on\nwritten exams, the median weight assigned to them was\n30 percent\u2014half the weight given to New Haven\u2019s written\nexam. Id., at 309.\n   Testimony before the CSB indicated that these alterna\ntive methods were both more reliable and notably less\ndiscriminatory in operation. According to Donald Day of\nthe International Association of Black Professional Fire\nfighters, nearby Bridgeport saw less skewed results after\nswitching to a selection process that placed primary\nweight on an oral exam. CA2 App. A830\u2013A832; see supra,\nat 7\u20138. And Hornick described assessment centers as\n\u201cdemonstrat[ing] dramatically less adverse impacts\u201d than\nwritten exams. CA2 App. A1040.14 Considering the\nprevalence of these proven alternatives, New Haven was\npoorly positioned to argue that promotions based on its\noutmoded and exclusionary selection process qualified as a\nbusiness necessity.

See ante, at 28. Perhaps such reasoning would\nhave sufficed under Wards Cove, which permitted exclu\nsionary practices as long as they advanced an employer\u2019s\n\u201clegitimate\u201d goals. 490 U. S., at 659.

See also supra, at 17.\nLike the chess player who tries to win by sweeping the\nopponent\u2019s pieces off the table, the Court simply shuts\nfrom its sight the formidable obstacles New Haven would\nhave faced in defending against a disparate-impact suit.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Finding the evidence concerning these alternatives insufficiently\n\ndeveloped to \u201ccreate a genuine issue of fact,\u201d ante, at 32, the Court\neffectively confirms that an employer cannot prevail under its strong\nbasis-in-evidence standard unless the employer decisively proves a\ndisparate-impact violation against itself. The Court\u2019s specific argu\nments are unavailing.       First, the Court suggests, changing the\noral/written weighting may have violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition on\naltering test scores. Ante, at 31. No one is arguing, however, that the\nresults of the exams given should have been altered. Rather, the\nargument is that the City could have availed itself of a better option\nwhen it initially decided what selection process to use. Second, with\nrespect to assessment centers, the Court identifies \u201cstatements to the\nCSB indicat[ing] that the Department could not have used [them] for\nthe 2003 examinations.\u201d Ante, at 31\u201332. The Court comes up with only\na single statement on this subject\u2014an offhand remark made by peti\ntioner Ricci, who hardly qualifies as an expert in testing methods. See\nante, at 14. Given the large number of municipalities that regularly\nuse assessment centers, it is impossible to fathom why the City, with\nproper planning, could not have done so as well.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Under the City\u2019s ground rules,\nIOS was not allowed to show the exams to anyone in the\nNew Haven Fire Department prior to their administra\ntion.

As a result, some of the exam questions were\nconfusing or irrelevant, and the exams may have over\ntested some subject-matter areas while missing others.\nSee, e.g., id., at A1034\u2013A1035, A1051.

The record does not\nsubstantiate this assertion. As Legel testified during his\ndeposition, the technical report merely summarized \u201cthe\nsteps that [IOS] took methodologically speaking,\u201d and\nwould not have established the exams\u2019 reliability.

See also id., at A462 (the report \u201cdoesn\u2019t say\nanything that other documents that already existed\nwouldn\u2019t say\u201d).\n   In sum, the record solidly establishes that the City had\ngood cause to fear disparate-impact liability. Moreover,\nthe Court supplies no tenable explanation why the evi\ndence of the tests\u2019 multiple deficiencies does not create at\nleast a triable issue under a strong-basis-in-evidence\nstandard.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 The I-O Psychologists Brief identifies still other, more technical\n\nflaws in the exams that may well have precluded the City from prevail\ning in a disparate-impact suit. Notably, the exams were never shown to\nbe suitably precise to allow strict rank ordering of candidates. A\ndifference of one or two points on a multiple-choice exam should not be\ndecisive of an applicant\u2019s promotion chances if that difference bears\nlittle relationship to the applicant\u2019s qualifications for the job. Relat\nedly, it appears that the line between a passing and failing score did\nnot accurately differentiate between qualified and unqualified candi\ndates.

A reasonable jury, he maintains, could\nhave found that respondents were not actually motivated\nby concern about disparate-impact litigation, but instead\nsought only \u201cto placate a politically important [African-\nAmerican] constituency.\u201d Ante, at 3. As earlier noted, I\nwould not oppose a remand for further proceedings fair to\nboth sides. See supra, at 26, n. 10. It is the Court that\nhas chosen to short-circuit this litigation based on its\npretension that the City has shown, and can show, noth\ning more than a statistical disparity. See supra, at 24,\nn. 8, 25. JUSTICE ALITO compounds the Court\u2019s error.\n  Offering a truncated synopsis of the many hours of\ndeliberations undertaken by the CSB, JUSTICE ALITO finds\nevidence suggesting that respondents\u2019 stated desire to\ncomply with Title VII was insincere, a mere \u201cpretext\u201d for\ndiscrimination against white firefighters. Ante, at 2\u20133. In\nsupport of his assertion, JUSTICE ALITO recounts at length\nthe alleged machinations of Rev. Boise Kimber (a local\npolitical activist), Mayor John DeStefano, and certain\nmembers of the mayor\u2019s staff. See ante, at 3\u201310.\n  Most of the allegations JUSTICE ALITO repeats are\ndrawn from petitioners\u2019 statement of facts they deem\nundisputed, a statement displaying an adversarial zeal\nnot uncommonly found in such presentations.17 What\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 Some  of petitioners\u2019 so-called facts find little support in the record,\nand many others can scarcely be deemed material. Petitioners allege,\nfor example, that City officials prevented New Haven\u2019s fire chief and\nassistant chief from sharing their views about the exams with the CSB.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 228a. None of the materials\npetitioners cite, however, \u201csuggests\u201d that this proposition is accurate.\nCf. ante, at 5. In her deposition testimony, City official Karen Dubois-\nWalton specifically denied that she or her colleagues directed the chief\n34                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncannot credibly be denied, however, is that the decision\nagainst certification of the exams was made neither by\nKimber nor by the mayor and his staff. The relevant\ndecision was made by the CSB, an unelected, politically\ninsulated body. It is striking that JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s concur\nrence says hardly a word about the CSB itself, perhaps\nbecause there is scant evidence that its motivation was\nanything other than to comply with Title VII\u2019s disparate\nimpact provision. Notably, petitioners did not even seek to\ntake depositions of the two commissioners who voted\nagainst certification. Both submitted uncontested affida\nvits declaring unequivocally that their votes were \u201cbased\nsolely on [their] good faith belief that certification\u201d would\nhave discriminated against minority candidates in viola\ntion of federal law. CA2 App. A1605, A1611.\n   JUSTICE ALITO discounts these sworn statements, sug\ngesting that the CSB\u2019s deliberations were tainted by the\npreferences of Kimber and City officials, whether or not\nthe CSB itself was aware of the taint. Kimber and City\nofficials, JUSTICE ALITO speculates, decided early on to\noppose certification and then \u201cengineered\u201d a skewed pres\nentation to the CSB to achieve their preferred outcome.\nAnte, at 12.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nand assistant chief not to appear.

Moreover, contrary to the insinuations of petitioners and\nJUSTICE ALITO, the statements made by City officials before the CSB did\nnot emphasize allegations of cheating by test takers. Cf. ante, at 7\u20138.\nIn her deposition, Dubois-Walton acknowledged sharing the cheating\nallegations not with the CSB, but with a different City commission.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 837a. JUSTICE ALITO also\nreports that the City\u2019s attorney advised the mayor\u2019s team that the way\nto convince the CSB not to certify was \u201cto focus on something other\nthan \u2018a big discussion re: adverse impact\u2019 law.\u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131428, p. 458a). This is a misleading abbre\nviation of the attorney\u2019s advice. Focusing on the exams\u2019 defects and on\ndisparate-impact law is precisely what he recommended.

The CSB, the record reveals,\ndesigned and conducted an inclusive decisionmaking\nprocess, in which it heard from numerous individuals on\nboth sides of the certification question. See, e.g., CA2 App.\nA1090. Kimber and others no doubt used strong words to\nurge the CSB not to certify the exam results, but the CSB\nreceived \u201cpressure\u201d from supporters of certification as well\nas opponents. Cf. ante, at 6. Petitioners, for example,\nengaged counsel to speak on their behalf before the CSB.\nTheir counsel did not mince words: \u201c[I]f you discard these\nresults,\u201d she warned, \u201cyou will get sued. You will force the\ntaxpayers of the city of New Haven into protracted litiga\ntion.\u201d CA2 App. A816. See also id., at A788.\n   The local firefighters union\u2014an organization required\nby law to represent all the City\u2019s firefighters\u2014was simi\nlarly outspoken in favor of certification. Discarding the\ntest results, the union\u2019s president told the CSB, would be\n\u201ctotally ridiculous.\u201d Id., at A806. He insisted, inaccu\nrately, that the City was not at risk of disparate-impact\nliability because the exams were administered pursuant to\n\u201ca collective bargaining agreement.\u201d Id., at A1137. Cf.\nsupra, at 26\u201327, n. 11. Never mentioned by JUSTICE\nALITO in his attempt to show testing expert Christopher\nHornick\u2019s alliance with the City, ante, at 8\u20139, the CSB\nsolicited Hornick\u2019s testimony at the union\u2019s suggestion, not\nthe City\u2019s. CA2 App. A1128. Hornick\u2019s cogent testimony\nraised substantial doubts about the exams\u2019 reliability. See\nsupra, at 8\u201310.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 City officials, JUSTICE ALITO reports, sent Hornick newspaper ac\n\ncounts and other material about the exams prior to his testimony.\nAnte, at 8. Some of these materials, JUSTICE ALITO intimates, may have\ngiven Hornick an inaccurate portrait of the exams. But Hornick\u2019s\ntestimony before the CSB, viewed in full, indicates that Hornick had an\naccurate understanding of the exam process. Much of Hornick\u2019s analy\nsis focused on the 60/40 weighting of the written and oral exams,\n36                      RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  There is scant cause to suspect that maneuvering or\noverheated rhetoric, from either side, prevented the CSB\nfrom evenhandedly assessing the reliability of the exams\nand rendering an independent, good-faith decision on\ncertification. JUSTICE ALITO acknowledges that the CSB\nhad little patience for Kimber\u2019s antics. Ante, at 6\u20137.19 As\nto petitioners, Chairman Segaloff\u2014who voted to certify\nthe exam results\u2014dismissed the threats made by their\ncounsel as unhelpful and needlessly \u201cinflammatory.\u201d CA2\nApp. A821. Regarding the views expressed by City offi\ncials, the CSB made clear that they were entitled to no\nspecial weight. Id., at A1080.20\n  In any event, JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s analysis contains a more\nfundamental flaw: It equates political considerations with\nunlawful discrimination. As JUSTICE ALITO sees it, if the\nmayor and his staff were motivated by their desire \u201cto\nplacate a . . . racial constituency,\u201d ante, at 3, then they\nengaged in unlawful discrimination against petitioners.\nBut JUSTICE ALITO fails to ask a vital question: \u201c[P]lacate\u201d\nhow? That political officials would have politics in mind is\nhardly extraordinary, and there are many ways in which a\npolitician can attempt to win over a constituency\u2014\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsomething that neither the Court nor the concurrences even attempt to\ndefend. It is, moreover, entirely misleading to say that the City later\nhired union-proposed Hornick as a \u201crewar[d]\u201d for his testimony. Cf.\nAnte, at 9.\n   19 To be clear, the Board of Fire Commissioners on which Kimber\n\nserved is an entity separate from the CSB. Kimber was not a member\nof the CSB. Kimber, JUSTICE ALITO states, requested a private meeting\nwith the CSB. Ante, at 6. There is not a shred of evidence that a\nprivate meeting with Kimber or anyone else took place.\n   20 JUSTICE ALITO points to evidence that the mayor had decided not to\n\nmake promotions based on the exams even if the CSB voted to certify\nthe results, going so far as to prepare a press release to that effect.\nAnte, at 9. If anything, this evidence reinforces the conclusion that the\nCSB\u2014which made the noncertification decision\u2014remained independ\nent and above the political fray. The mayor and his staff needed a\ncontingency plan precisely because they did not control the CSB.\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            37\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nincluding a racial constituency\u2014without engaging in\nunlawful discrimination.       As courts have recognized,\n\u201c[p]oliticians routinely respond to bad press . . . , but it is\nnot a violation of Title VII to take advantage of a situation\nto gain political favor.\u201d Henry v. Jones, 507 F. 3d 558, 567\n(CA7 2007).\n   The real issue, then, is not whether the mayor and his\nstaff were politically motivated; it is whether their at\ntempt to score political points was legitimate (i.e., nondis\ncriminatory). Were they seeking to exclude white fire\nfighters from promotion (unlikely, as a fair test would\nundoubtedly result in the addition of white firefighters to\nthe officer ranks), or did they realize, at least belatedly,\nthat their tests could be toppled in a disparate-impact\nsuit? In the latter case, there is no disparate-treatment\nviolation. JUSTICE ALITO, I recognize, would disagree. In\nhis view, an employer\u2019s action to avoid Title VII disparate\nimpact liability qualifies as a presumptively improper\nrace-based employment decision. See ante, at 2. I reject\nthat construction of Title VII. See supra, at 18\u201320. As I\nsee it, when employers endeavor to avoid exposure to\ndisparate-impact liability, they do not thereby encounter\nliability for disparate treatment.\n   Applying this understanding of Title VII, supported by\nGriggs and the long line of decisions following Griggs, see\nsupra, at 16\u201317, and nn. 3\u20134, the District Court found no\ngenuine dispute of material fact. That court noted, par\nticularly, the guidance furnished by Second Circuit prece\ndent. See supra, at 12. Petitioners\u2019 allegations that City\nofficials took account of politics, the District Court deter\nmined, simply \u201cd[id] not suffice\u201d to create an inference of\nunlawful discrimination. 554 F. Supp. 2d, at 160, n. 12.\nThe noncertification decision, even if undertaken \u201cin a\npolitical context,\u201d reflected a legitimate \u201cintent not to\nimplement a promotional process based on testing results\nthat had an adverse impact.\u201d Id., at 158, 160. Indeed, the\n38                       RICCI v. DESTEFANO\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court perceived \u201ca total absence of any evidence of\ndiscriminatory animus towards [petitioners].\u201d Id., at 158.\nSee also id., at 162 (\u201cNothing in the record in this case\nsuggests that the City defendants or CSB acted \u2018because\nof\u2019 discriminatory animus toward [petitioners] or other\nnon-minority applicants for promotion.\u201d). Perhaps the\nDistrict Court could have been more expansive in its\ndiscussion of these issues, but its conclusions appear\nentirely consistent with the record before it.21\n   It is indeed regrettable that the City\u2019s noncertification\ndecision would have required all candidates to go through\nanother selection process. But it would have been more\nregrettable to rely on flawed exams to shut out candidates\nwho may well have the command presence and other\nqualities needed to excel as fire officers. Yet that is the\nchoice the Court makes today. It is a choice that breaks\nthe promise of Griggs that groups long denied equal oppor\ntunity would not be held back by tests \u201cfair in form, but\ndiscriminatory in operation.\u201d 401 U. S., at 431.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   21 The District Court, JUSTICE ALITO writes, \u201call but conceded that a\n\njury could find that the City\u2019s asserted justification was pretextual\u201d by\n\u201cadmitt[ing] that \u2018a jury could rationally infer that city officials worked\nbehind the scenes to sabotage the promotional examinations because\nthey knew that, were the exams certified, the Mayor would incur the\nwrath of [Rev. Boise] Kimber and other influential leaders of New\nHaven\u2019s African-American community.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 3, 13 (quoting 554 F.\nSupp. 2d, at 162). The District Court drew the quoted passage from\npetitioners\u2019 lower court brief, and used it in reference to a First Amend\nment claim not before this Court. In any event, it is not apparent why\nthese alleged political maneuvers suggest an intent to discriminate\nagainst petitioners. That City officials may have wanted to please\npolitical supporters is entirely consistent with their stated desire to\navoid a disparate-impact violation. Cf. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S. ___,\n___ (2009) (slip op., at 18) (allegations that senior Government officials\ncondoned the arrest and detention of thousands of Arab Muslim men\nfollowing the September 11 attacks failed to establish even a \u201cplausible\ninference\u201d of unlawful discrimination sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss).\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          39\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                         *     *     *\n  This case presents an unfortunate situation, one New\nHaven might well have avoided had it utilized a better\nselection process in the first place. But what this case\ndoes not present is race-based discrimination in violation\nof Title VII. I dissent from the Court\u2019s judgment, which\nrests on the false premise that respondents showed \u201ca\nsignificant statistical disparity,\u201d but \u201cnothing more.\u201d See\nante, at 27\u201328.\n</pre>",
