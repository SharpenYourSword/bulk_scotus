He sought this information to determine whether the banks had violated the State's fair-lending laws. Spitzer's successor in office, Andrew Cuomo, is the petitioner here. Respondents, the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"Comptroller\" or \"OCC\") and the Clearing House Association, a banking trade group, brought suit to enjoin the information request, claiming that the Comptroller's regulation promulgated under the National Bank Act prohibits that form of state law enforcement against national banks.</p>\n<p>The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an injunction in favor of respondents, prohibiting the attorney general from enforcing state fair-lending laws through demands for records or judicial proceedings. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 510 F.3d 105 (2007). We granted certiorari. 555 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 987, 173 L.Ed.2d 171 (2009). The question presented is whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2715</span> the Comptroller's regulation purporting to pre-empt state law enforcement can be upheld as a reasonable interpretation of the National Bank Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Section 484(a) of Title 12, U.S.C., a provision of the National Bank Act, 13 Stat. 99, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in the courts of justice or such as shall be, or have been exercised or directed by Congress or by either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either House duly authorized.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The Comptroller, charged with administering the National Bank Act, adopted, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the regulation at issue here designed to implement the statutory provision. Its principal provisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"\u00a7 7.4000 Visitorial powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) <i>General rule.</i> (1) Only the OCC or an authorized representative of the OCC may exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. State officials may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks, or prosecuting enforcement actions, except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law. However, production of a bank's records (other than non-public OCC information under 12 CFR part 4, subpart C) may be required under normal judicial procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) For purposes of this section, visitorial powers include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) Examination of a bank;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) Inspection of a bank's books and records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(iii) Regulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(iv) Enforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000 (2009).</blockquote>\n<p>By its clear text, this regulation prohibits the States from \"prosecuting enforcement actions\" except in \"limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\"</p>\n<p>Under the familiar <i>Chevron</i> framework, we defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering. <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). There is necessarily some ambiguity as to the meaning of the statutory term \"visitorial powers,\" especially since we are working in an era when the prerogative writs\u0097through which visitorial powers were traditionally enforced\u0097 are not in vogue. The Comptroller can give authoritative meaning to the statute within the bounds of that uncertainty. But the presence of some uncertainty does not expand <i>Chevron</i> deference to cover virtually any interpretation of the National Bank Act. We can discern the outer limits of the term \"visitorial powers\" even through the clouded lens of history. They do not include, as the Comptroller's expansive regulation would provide, ordinary enforcement of the law. Evidence from the time of the statute's enactment, a long line of our own cases, and application of normal principles of construction to the National Bank Act make that clear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Historically, the sovereign's right of visitation over corporations paralleled the right of the church to supervise its institutions and the right of the founder of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2716</span> charitable institution \"to see that [his] property [was] rightly employed,\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 469 (1765). By extension of this principle, \"[t]he king [was] by law the visitor of all civil corporations,\" <i>ibid.</i> A visitor could inspect and control the visited institution at will.</p>\n<p>When the National Bank Act was enacted in 1864, \"visitation\" was accordingly understood as \"[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation\" by \"the government itself.\" 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 790 (15th ed. 1883). Lower courts understood \"visitation\" to mean \"the act of a superior or superintending officer, who visits a corporation to examine into its manner of conducting business, and enforce an observance of its laws and regulations.\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Youngstown v. Hughes,</i> 6 F. 737, 740 (C.C.N.D.Ohio 1881). A State was the \"visitor\" of all companies incorporated in the State, simply by virtue of the State's role as sovereign: The \"legislature is the visitor of all corporations founded by it.\" <i>Guthrie v. Harkness,</i> 199 U.S. 148, 157, 26 S.Ct. 4, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>This relationship between sovereign and corporation was understood to allow the States to use prerogative writs\u0097such as mandamus and <i>quo warranto</i>\u0097to exercise control \"whenever a corporation [wa]s abusing the power given it, or, . . . or acting adversely to the public, or creating a nuisance.\" H. Wilgus, Private Corporations, in 8 American Law and Procedure \u00a7 157, pp. 224-225 (1910). State visitorial commissions were authorized to \"exercise a general supervision\" over companies in the State. I. Wormser, Private Corporations \u00a7 80, pp. 100, 101, in 4 Modern American Law (1921).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our cases have always understood \"visitation\" as this right to oversee corporate affairs, quite separate from the power to enforce the law. In the famous <i>Dartmouth College</i> case, Justice Story, describing visitation of a charitable corporation, wrote that Dartmouth was \"subject to the controlling authority of its legal visitor, who . . . may amend and repeal its statutes, remove its officers, correct abuses, and generally superintend the management of [its] trusts,\" and who are \"liable to no supervision or control.\" <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> 4 Wheat. 518, 676, 681, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819) (concurring opinion). This power of \"genera[l] superintend[ence]\" stood in contrast to action by the court of chancery, which acted \"not as itself possessing a visitorial power. . . but as possessing a general jurisdiction. . . to redress grievances, and frauds.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 676.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Guthrie, supra,</i> we held that a shareholder acting in his role as a private individual was not exercising a \"visitorial power\" under the National Bank Act when he petitioned a court to force the production of corporate records, <i>id.,</i> at 159, 26 S.Ct. 4. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2717</span> \"[C]ontrol in the courts of justice,\" we said, is not visitorial, and we drew a contrast between the nonvisitorial act of \"su[ing] in the courts of the State\" and the visitorial \"supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency,\" <i>id.,</i> at 159, 157, 26 S.Ct. 4.</p>\n<p>In <i>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri,</i> 263 U.S. 640, 44 S.Ct. 213, 68 L.Ed. 486 (1924), we upheld the right of the Attorney General of Missouri to bring suit to enforce a state anti-bank-branching law against a national bank. We said that only the United States may perform visitorial administrative oversight, such as \"inquir[ing] by <i>quo warranto</i> whether a national bank is acting in excess of its charter powers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213. But if a state statute of general applicability is not substantively pre-empted, then \"the power of enforcement must rest with the [State] and not with\" the National Government, <i>ibid.</i><sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Our most recent decision, <i>Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A.,</i> 550 U.S. 1, 127 S.Ct. 1559, 167 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007), does not, as the dissent contends, <i>post,</i> at 2731, \"suppor[t] OCC's construction of the statute.\" To the contrary, it is fully in accord with the well established distinction between supervision and law enforcement. <i>Watters</i> held that a State may not exercise \"`general supervision and control'\" over a subsidiary of a national bank, 550 U.S., at 8, 127 S.Ct. 1559, because \"multiple audits and surveillance under rival oversight regimes\" would cause uncertainty, <i>id.,</i> at 21, 127 S.Ct. 1559. \"[G]eneral supervision and control\" and \"oversight\" are worlds apart from law enforcement. All parties to the case agreed that Michigan's general oversight regime could not be imposed on national banks; the sole question was whether operating subsidiaries of national banks enjoyed the same immunity from state visitation. The opinion addresses and answers no other question.</p>\n<p>The foregoing cases all involve enforcement of state law. But if the Comptroller's exclusive exercise of visitorial powers precluded law enforcement by the States, it would also preclude law enforcement by federal agencies. Of course it does not. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Sav. Assn. v. Douglas,</i> 105 F.2d 100, 105-106 (CADC 1939) (Securities Exchange Commission investigation of bank fraud is not an exercise of \"visitorial powers\"); <i>Peoples Bank of Danville v. Williams,</i> 449 F.Supp. 254, 260 (W.D.Va.1978) (same).</p>\n<p>In sum, the unmistakable and utterly consistent teaching of our jurisprudence, both before and after enactment of the National Bank Act, is that a sovereign's \"visitorial powers\" and its power to enforce the law are two different things. There is not a credible argument to the contrary. And contrary to what the Comptroller's regulation says, the National Bank Act pre-empts only the former.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The consequences of the regulation also cast doubt upon its validity. No one denies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2718</span> that the National Bank Act leaves in place some state substantive laws affecting banks. See Brief for Federal Respondent 20; Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association, L.L.C. 29; <i>post,</i> at 2730-2731. But the Comptroller's rule says that the State may not <i>enforce</i> its valid, non-pre-empted laws against national banks. <i>Ibid.</i> The bark remains, but the bite does not.</p>\n<p>The dissent admits, with considerable understatement, that such a result is \"unusual,\" <i>ibid.</i> \"Bizarre\" would be more apt. As the Court said in <i>St. Louis:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"To demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law.\" 263 U.S., at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213.</blockquote>\n<p>In sharp contrast to the \"unusual\" reading propounded by the Comptroller's regulation, reading \"visitorial powers\" as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result\u0097the precise result contemplated by our opinion in <i>St. Louis,</i> which said that if a state statute is valid as to national banks, \"the corollary that it is obligatory <i>and enforceable</i> necessarily results.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 659-660, 44 S.Ct. 213 (emphasis added). Channeling state attorneys general into judicial law-enforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to exercise \"visitorial\" oversight) would preserve a regime of exclusive administrative oversight by the Comptroller while honoring in fact rather than merely in theory Congress's decision not to pre-empt substantive state law. This system echoes many other mixed state/federal regimes in which the Federal Government exercises general oversight while leaving state substantive law in place. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Wyeth v. Levine,</i> 555 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009).</p>\n<p>This reading is also suggested by \u00a7 484(a)'s otherwise inexplicable reservation of state powers \"vested in the courts of justice.\" As described earlier, visitation was normally conducted through use of the prerogative writs of mandamus and <i>quo warranto.</i> The exception could not possibly exempt that manner of exercising visitation, or else the exception would swallow the rule. Its only conceivable purpose is to preserve normal civil and criminal lawsuits. To be sure, the reservation of powers \"vested in the courts of justice\" is phrased as an exception from the prohibition of visitorial powers. But as we have just discussed, it cannot possibly be that, and it is explicable only as an attempt to make clear that the courts' ordinary powers of enforcing the law are not affected.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>On a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and law enforcement is clear. If a State chooses to pursue enforcement of its laws in court, then it is not exercising its power of visitation and will be treated like a litigant. An attorney general acting as a civil litigant must file a lawsuit, survive a motion to dismiss, endure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2719</span> the rules of procedure and discovery, and risk sanctions if his claim is frivolous or his discovery tactics abusive. Judges are trusted to prevent \"fishing expeditions\" or an undirected rummaging through bank books and records for evidence of some unknown wrongdoing. In New York, civil discovery is far more limited than the full range of \"visitorial powers\" that may be exercised by a sovereign. Courts may enter protective orders to prevent \"unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice,\" N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 3103(a) (West 2005), and may supervise discovery <i>sua sponte,</i> \u00a7 3104(a). A visitor, by contrast, may inspect books and records at any time for any or no reason.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Comptroller's regulation, therefore, does not comport with the statute. Neither does the Comptroller's <i>interpretation</i> of its regulation, which differs from the text and must be discussed separately.</p>\n<p>Evidently realizing that exclusion of state enforcement of <i>all</i> state laws against national banks is too extreme to be contemplated, the Comptroller sought to limit the sweep of its regulation by the following passage set forth in the agency's statement of basis and purpose in the Federal Register:</p>\n<blockquote>\"What the case law <i>does</i> recognize is that `states retain some power to regulate national banks in areas such as contracts, debt collection, acquisition and transfer of property, and taxation, zoning, criminal, and tort law.' [citing a Ninth Circuit case.] Application of these laws to national banks and their implementation by state authorities typically does not affect the content or extent of the Federally-authorized business of banking . . . but rather establishes the legal infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability of national banks . . . to do business.\" 69 Fed.Reg. 1896 (2004) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>This cannot be reconciled with the regulation's almost categorical prohibition in 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a)(1) of \"prosecuting enforcement actions.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Nor can it be justified by the provision in subsection (a)(2)(iv) which defines visitorial powers to include \"[e]nforcing compliance with any applicable. . . state laws concerning\" \"activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law,\" \u00a7 7.4000(a)(2)(iii). The latter phrase cannot be interpreted to include only distinctively banking activities (leaving the States free to enforce nonbanking state laws), because if it were so interpreted subsection (a)(2)(iii), which uses the same terminology, would limit the Comptroller's exclusive visitorial power of \"regulation and supervision\" to distinctively banking activities\u0097which no one thinks is the case. Anyway, the National Bank Act <i>does</i> specifically authorize and permit activities that fall within what the statement of basis and purpose calls \"the legal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2720</span> infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability of national banks . . . to do business.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 Third (power to make contracts); \u00a7 24 Seventh (\"all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking\"). And of course a distinction between \"implementation\" of \"infrastructure\" and judicial enforcement of other laws can be found nowhere within the text of the statute. This passage in the statement of basis and purpose, resting upon neither the text of the regulation nor the text of the statute, attempts to do what Congress declined to do: exempt national banks from all state banking laws, or at least state enforcement of those laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The dissent fails to persuade us. Its fundamental contention\u0097that the exclusive grant of visitorial powers can be interpreted to preclude state enforcement of state laws\u0097rests upon a logical fallacy. The dissent establishes, <i>post,</i> at 2726, (and we do not at all contest), that in the course of exercising visitation powers the sovereign can compel compliance with the law. But it concludes from that, <i>post,</i> at 2727, that <i>any</i> sovereign attempt to compel compliance with the law can be deemed an exercise of the visitation power. That conclusion obviously does not follow. For example, in the course of exercising its visitation powers, the sovereign can assuredly compel a bank to honor obligations that are in default. Does that mean that the sovereign's taking the same action in executing a civil judgment for payment of those obligations can be considered an exercise of the visitation power? Of course not. Many things can be compelled through the visitation power that can be compelled through the exercise of other sovereign power as well. The critical question is not what is being compelled, but what sovereign power has been invoked to compel it. And the power to enforce the law exists separate and apart from the power of visitation.</p>\n<p>The dissent argues that the Comptroller's expansive reading of \"visitorial powers\" does not intrude upon the, \"`the historic police powers of the States,'\" <i>post,</i> at 2732, (quoting <i>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</i> 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947)), because, like federal maritime law, federal involvement in this field dates to \"`the earliest days of the Republic,'\" <i>post,</i> at 2733 (quoting <i>United States v. Locke,</i> 529 U.S. 89, 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d 69 (2000)). For that reason, the dissent concludes, this case does not raise the sort of federalism concerns that prompt a presumption against pre-emption. We have not invoked the presumption against pre-emption, and think it unnecessary to do so in giving force to the plain terms of the National Bank Act. Neither, however, should the incursion that the Comptroller's regulation makes upon traditional state powers be minimized. Although the sovereign visitorial power of assuring national-bank compliance with <i>all</i> laws inhered in the Federal Government from the time of its creation of national banks, the Comptroller was not given authority to enforce nonpre-empted state laws until 1966. See Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966, Tit. III, 80 Stat. 1046-1055. A power first exercised during the lifetime of every current Justice is hardly involvement \"from the earliest days of the Republic.\"</p>\n<p>States, on the other hand, have always enforced their general laws against national banks\u0097and have enforced their banking-related laws against national banks for at least 85 years, as evidenced by <i>St. Louis,</i> in which we upheld enforcement of a state anti-bank-branching law, 263 U.S., at 656, 44 S.Ct. 213. See also <i>Anderson</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2721</span> <i>Nat. Bank v. Luckett,</i> 321 U.S. 233, 237, 248-249, 64 S.Ct. 599, 88 L.Ed. 692 (1944) (state commissioner of revenue may enforce abandoned-bank-deposit law against national bank through \"judicial proceedings\"); <i>State by </i><i>Lord v. First Nat. Bank of St. Paul,</i> 313 N.W.2d 390, 393 (Minn. 1981) (state treasurer may enforce general unclaimed-property law with \"specific provisions directed toward\" banks against national bank); <i>Clovis Nat. Bank v. Callaway,</i> 69 N.M. 119, 130-132, 364 P.2d 748, 756 (1961) (state treasurer may enforce unclaimed-property law against national bank deposits); <i>State v. First Nat. Bank of Portland,</i> 61 Or. 551, 554-557, 123 P. 712, 714 (1912) (state attorney general may enforce bank-specific escheat law against national bank).<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The dissent seeks to minimize the regulation's incursion upon state powers by claiming that the regulation does not \"declare the pre-emptive scope of the [National Bank Act]\" but merely \"interpret[s] the term `visitorial powers.'\" <i>Post,</i> at 2732. That is much too kind. It is not without reason that the regulation is contained within a subpart of the Comptroller's regulations on Bank Activities and Operations that is entitled \"Preemption.\" The purpose and function of the statutory term \"visitorial powers\" is to define and thereby limit the category of action reserved to the Federal Government and forbidden to the States. Any interpretation of \"visitorial powers\" necessarily \"declares the preemptive scope of the NBA,\" <i>ibid.</i> What is clear from logic is also clear in application: The regulation declares that \"[s]tate officials may not . . . prosecut[e] enforcement actions.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a). If that is not pre-emption, nothing is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Applying the foregoing principles to this case is not difficult. \"Visitorial powers\" in the National Bank Act refers to a sovereign's supervisory powers over corporations. They include any form of administrative oversight that allows a sovereign to inspect books and records on demand, even if the process is mediated by a court through prerogative writs or similar means. The Comptroller reasonably interpreted this statutory term to include \"conducting examinations [and] inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks,\" \u00a7 7.4000, when the State conducts those activities in its capacity as supervisor of corporations.</p>\n<p>When, however, a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer. Such a lawsuit is not an exercise of \"visitorial powers\" and thus the Comptroller erred by extending the definition of \"visitorial powers\" to include \"prosecuting enforcement actions\" in state courts, \u00a7 7.4000.</p>\n<p>The request for information in the present case was stated to be \"in lieu of\" other action; implicit was the threat that if the request was not voluntarily honored, that other action would be taken. All parties have assumed, and we agree, that if the threatened action would have been unlawful the request-cum-threat could be enjoined. Here the threatened action was not the bringing of a civil suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant based on probable cause, but rather the Attorney General's issuance of subpoena on his own authority under New York <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2722</span> Executive Law, which permits such subpoenas in connection with his investigation of \"repeated fraudulent or illegal acts . . . in the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business.\" See N.Y. Exec. Law Ann. \u00a7 63(12) (West 2002). That is not the exercise of the power of law enforcement \"vested in the courts of justice\" which 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a) exempts from the ban on exercise of supervisory power.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the injunction below is affirmed as applied to the threatened issuance of executive subpoenas by the Attorney General for the State of New York, but vacated insofar as it prohibits the Attorney General from bringing judicial enforcement actions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that the term \"visitorial powers\" as used in the National Bank Act (NBA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a), refers only \"to a sovereign's supervisory powers over corporations,\" which are limited to \"administrative oversight\" including \"inspect[ion of] books and records on demand.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2721. Based on this definition, the Court concludes that \u00a7 484(a) does not pre-empt a \"state attorney general['s] . . . suit to enforce state law against a national bank.\" <i>Ibid.</i> I would affirm the Court of Appeals' determinations that the term \"visitorial powers\" is ambiguous and that it was reasonable for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to interpret the term to encompass state efforts to obtain national bank records and to enforce state fair lending laws against national banks. Accordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The NBA provides that \"[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in the courts of justice or such as shall be, or have been exercised or directed by Congress or by either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either House duly authorized.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a). Through notice-and-comment rulemaking, OCC issued a regulation defining \"visitorial powers\" as including: \"(i) Examination of a bank; (ii) Inspection of a bank's books and records; (iii) Regulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law; and (iv) Enforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a)(2) (2005). OCC further concluded that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a)'s \"vested in the courts of justice\" exception pertains only to the \"powers inherent in the judiciary and does not grant state or other governmental authorities any right to inspect, superintend, direct, regulate or compel compliance by a national bank with respect to any law, regarding the content or conduct of activities authorized for national banks under Federal law.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(b)(2). The Court of Appeals upheld OCC's regulation as reasonable. See 510 F.3d 105 (C.A.2 2007).</p>\n<p>This Court's decision in <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), provides the framework for deciding this case. \"In <i>Chevron,</i> this Court held that ambiguities in statutes within an agency's jurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2723</span> agency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.\" <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,</i> 545 U.S. 967, 980, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005). Accordingly, \"[i]f a statute is ambiguous, and if the implementing agency's construction is reasonable, <i>Chevron</i> requires a federal court to accept the agency's construction of the statute, even if the agency's reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>OCC is \"the administrator charged with supervision of the [NBA],\" <i>NationsBank of N.C., N.A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.,</i> 513 U.S. 251, 256, 115 S.Ct. 810, 130 L.Ed.2d 740 (1995), and it acted through notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures in promulgating the regulation at issue in this case, see 69 Fed.Reg. 1895 (2004). As a result, 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000 falls within the heartland of <i>Chevron.</i> See <i>United States v. Mead Corp.,</i> 533 U.S. 218, 229-230, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001); see also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.,</i> 517 U.S. 735, 739, 116 S.Ct. 1730, 135 L.Ed.2d 25 (1996) (deferring to OCC's interpretation of the term \"`interest'\" in the NBA). \"It is our practice to defer to the reasonable judgments of agencies with regard to the meaning of ambiguous terms in statutes that they are charged with administering,\" and \"that practice extends to the judgments of the Comptroller of the Currency with regard to the meaning of the banking laws.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The majority does not disagree. See <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716. As a result, the only disputed question is whether the statutory term \"visitorial powers\" is ambiguous and, if so, whether OCC's construction of it is reasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority concedes that there is \"some ambiguity as to the meaning of the statutory term `visitorial powers.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> Yet it concludes that OCC's interpretation of \u00a7 484(a) is not entitled to deference because the Court \"can discern the outer limits of the term `visitorial powers' even through the clouded lens of history\" and these outer definitional limits \"do not include. . . ordinary enforcement of the law.\" <i>Ibid.</i> I cannot agree. The statutory term \"visitorial powers\" is susceptible to more than one meaning, and the agency's construction is reasonable.</p>\n<p>Because the NBA does not define \"visitorial powers,\" the ordinary meaning of the words chosen by Congress provides the starting point for interpreting the statute. See <i>Dean v. United States,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 1853, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009) (\"We start, as always, with the language of the statute\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer,</i> 513 U.S. 179, 187, 115 S.Ct. 788, 130 L.Ed.2d 682 (1995) (\"When terms used in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary meaning\"). In 1864, when the NBA was enacted, \"visitation\" was generally defined as \"[i]nspection; superintendence; direction; [and] regulation.\" 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 598 (1860); see also 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 633 (1852) (defining \"visitation\" as \"[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation\"). With respect to civil corporations, \"visitation\" was conducted \"by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 634. The Court has previously looked to these definitions in examining the meaning of \"visitorial powers\" for purposes of the NBA. See <i>Guthrie v. Harkness,</i> 199 U.S. 148, 158, 26 S.Ct. 4, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905).</p>\n<p>OCC's interpretation of \"visitorial powers\" to include both \"[r]egulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law\" and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2724</span> \"[e]nforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities,\" 12 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 7.4000(a)(2)(iii), (vi), fits comfortably within this broad dictionary definition of \"visitation.\" And, in turn, petitioner's demand for nonpublic information to force national banks to comply with state fair lending laws under threat of judicial action would appear to qualify as an attempt to \"superinten[d]\" the banks' federally authorized operations \"through the medium of the courts of justice.\" See Burrill, <i>supra,</i> at 598; Bouvier, <i>supra,</i> at 634.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as the majority concludes, \"visitorial powers\" could be limited to conducting examinations of national banks or otherwise interfering with their internal operations. To support this argument, the majority briefly alludes to the common-law history of visitation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716; see also <i>United States v. Shabani,</i> 513 U.S. 10, 13, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994) (\"[A]bsent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms\"). In so doing, the majority fully accepts petitioner's argument that \"Congress invoked a then-familiar common law term of corporate governance\u0097visitation\u0097to clarify that the States, traditionally the supervisors of private corporations doing business within their jurisdictions, had no authority to examine the condition of a national bank, respond to any perceived financial risk, or hold the bank to its charter or the laws of its creation.\" Brief for Petitioner 21-22. Under the majority's view, any construction of \u00a7 484(a) that fails to preserve the right of the States to enforce through judicial action their generally applicable laws against national banks is unreasonable and, therefore, not entitled to deference. See <i>ante,</i> at 2717.</p>\n<p>But contrary to the majority's determination, the common-law tradition does not compel the conclusion that petitioner's definition of visitation is the only permissible interpretation of the term. Indeed, a more thorough examination of \u00a7 484(a)'s common-law ancestry suggests the opposite. As the majority notes, see <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716, the concept of visitation originated in Roman and canon law in which the term was used to describe the church hierarchy's authority over its own institutions, see Pound, Visitatorial Jurisdiction Over Corporations in Equity, 49 Harv. L.Rev. 369, 369-370 (1936). The practice of visitation later expanded to include the supervision of charities, universities, and civil corporations. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to churches, charities, and universities, a visitor's duties were narrow. In the university setting, for example, the \"power of the visitor [was] confined to offences against the <i>private</i> laws of the college; he ha[d] no cognizance of acts of disobedience to the general laws of the land.\" 2 S. Kyd, Law of Corporations 276 (1794) (emphasis in original). The visitor's duties were equally narrow in the governance of ecclesiastical and charitable institutions. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 467-472 (1765); <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> 4 Wheat. 518, 673-677, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819) (Story, J., concurring). If the sweep of a visitor's authority with respect to civil corporations was the same, the majority would have a stronger argument that the \"visitorial powers\" prohibition was similarly limited. See <i>ante,</i> at 2717. However, the common-law tradition instead suggests that visitorial powers were broader with respect to civil corporations, including banks.</p>\n<p>Historically, visitorial authority over civil corporations was exercised only by the sovereign who had broad authority to assure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2725</span> compliance with generally applicable laws. See Blackstone, <i>supra,</i> at 469 (\"The king being thus constituted by law the visitor of all civil corporations, the law has also appointed the place, wherein he shall exercise this jurisdiction: which is the court of king's bench; where, and where only, all misbehaviors of this kind of corporations are enquired into and redressed, and all their controversies decided\"); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 241 (1827) (explaining that \"visitation of civil corporations is by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice\"). \"Civil corporations, whether public, as the corporations of towns and cities; or private, as bank, insurance, manufacturing, and other companies of the like nature, are not subject to [private] visitation. They are subject to the general law of the land, and amenable to the judicial tribunals for the exercise and the abuse of their powers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 244; see also J. Angell &amp; S. Ames, Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 684, p. 680 (4th ed. 1852) (\"Civil corporations, whether public or private, being created for public use and advantage, properly fall under the superintendency of that sovereign power whose duty it is to take care of the public interest; whereas, corporations, whose object is the distribution of a private benefaction, may well find jealous guardians in the zeal or vanity of the founder, his heirs, or appointees\").</p>\n<p>States have traditionally exercised their visitorial powers over civil corporations by invoking the authority of the judiciary to \"compel domestic corporations or their officers to perform specific duties incumbent on them by reason of their charters, <i>or under statutes or ordinances or imposed by the common law.</i>\" Pound, <i>supra,</i> at 375 (emphasis added); see also S. Merrill, Law of Mandamus \u00a7 158, p. 194 (1892) (explaining that \"under the visitorial power of the state, any breach of duty by a private corporation may be corrected by\" the writ of mandamus and that the duty \"may be imposed by [the corporation's] charter, by the general statutes, or by the common law\" (footnotes omitted)). As Merrill explained, such actions were employed to compel common carriers and certain other civil corporations to adhere to \"statutory or common law\" duties, including the duty to \"exten[d] to all without discrimination the use of their services.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 162, at 200; see also J. Grant, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Corporations in General, As Well Aggregate as Sole 262 (1854) (explaining that mandamus was available when corporations \"refuse[d] to perform a duty cast upon them by the law of the land\").<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2726</span> Even before enactment of the NBA, several States enacted laws granting banking commissioners specific authority to investigate compliance with generally applicable laws and to use the courts to ensure observance therewith. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Act of Feb. 23, ch. 14, \u00a7 2, 1838 Mass. Acts p. 303 (authorizing banking commissioners to \"visit\" a bank and \"examine all [its] affairs\" to determine whether it had \"complied with the provisions of law applicable to [its] transactions\"); Act of May 14, ch. 363, \u00a7 12, 1840 N.Y. Laws pp. 307-308 (authorizing banking commissioners to bring judicial actions against banks \"found to have violated any law of this state . . . in the same manner and with the like effect as any incorporated bank may be proceeded against for a violation of its charter\"). Indeed, Congress modeled the NBA after New York's supervisory regime. See J. Knox, A History of Banking in the United States 422 (1903) (reprint 1969).</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, that this understanding of the common law confuses the sovereign's \"enforcement of general laws that apply equally to all actors within a State, like the ban on discrimination found in New York Executive Law \u00a7 296-a\" with \"an exercise of visitorial powers.\" Brief for Petitioner 24; see also <i>ante,</i> at 2717 (concluding that \"a sovereign's `visitorial powers' and its power to enforce the law are two different things\"). But this narrow conception of visitorial powers does not fully capture the common law. In a section entitled \"Visitorial power,\" one treatise explained that \"[a]s a general rule the state has the same control, in this respect, over corporations that it has over individuals.\" C. Elliott, Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 90, p. 80 (rev.3d ed.1900); see also 1 S. Thompson, Commentaries on the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 475, p. 580 (2d ed.1908) (\"In its visitorial capacity the state checks and controls corporate affairs, even for the protection of those who deal with them\"). If the sovereign's power of visitation was limited to oversight of \"corporate affairs,\" visitation would not parallel the sovereign's control over individuals or allow the sovereign to protect through judicial action the rights of individuals who \"deal with\" the corporation. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision in <i>Attorney General v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern R. Co.,</i> 35 Wis. 425 (1874) \u0097 which has been referred to as \"the leading American case for the visitorial jurisdiction of equity,\" Pound, 49 Harv. L.Rev., at 380\u0097 illustrates the point. In that case, the state attorney general sought a writ of injunction to \"restrain the two defendant companies from exacting tolls for the carriage of passengers or freight in excess of the maximum rates established by\" Wisconsin law, 35 Wis., at 432. The attorney general \"appl[ied] for the writ on behalf of the public,\" <i>id.,</i> at 531, in order \"`to correct abuses and save the rights of the people,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 572. The court found that the attorney general's visitorial power included enforcement of generally applicable law against civil corporations through courts of equity. See <i>id.,</i> at 529-530. As the court explained, the common-law understanding of visitorial powers had expanded beyond its ecclesiastical roots to include such authority. See <i>id.,</i> at 530 (\"The grounds on which this jurisdiction rests are ancient; but the extent of its application has grown rapidly of late years, until a comparatively obscure and insignificant jurisdiction has become one of great magnitude and public import\").</p>\n<p>As a result, the majority's conclusion that when \"a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2727</span> bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2721, cannot be reconciled with this leading case or the general common-law understanding on which the decision rests. At common law, all attempts by the sovereign to compel civil corporations to comply with state law\u0097whether through administrative subpoenas or judicial actions\u0097were visitorial in nature. Thus, even if the sovereign's law enforcement and visitorial powers were at one time distinct, by common law, they had merged at least with respect to the enforcement of generally applicable public laws against civil corporations. See Thompson, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 460, at 556 (\"The police power, <i>in its visitorial aspect,</i> as exercised by congress and the several states, extends to the minutest details of the banking business\" (emphasis added)). By construing visitation so narrowly, the majority implicitly rejects the efforts of William Blackstone, James Kent, and Roscoe Pound, see <i>supra,</i> at 2717, in elucidating the historical meaning of this concept. Like OCC, each of these venerable legal scholars understood visitation of civil corporations to include the power to enforce generally applicable laws through judicial actions. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In the end, OCC was presented with a broad dictionary definition of \"visitation\" and a common-law history suggesting that the scope of the visitor's authority varied in accordance with the nature of the organization under supervision. It is possible that the \"visitorial powers\" are narrower than OCC concluded. But a visitor's powers could also be broader. There is support for the proposition that visitation includes enforcement of all generally applicable laws. See <i>supra,</i> at 2716-2719. OCC instead interpreted \"visitorial powers\" to prohibit only enforcement of laws concerning \"activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law.\" 12 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 7.4000(a)(2)(iii) and (iv). States are thus free to enforce applicable laws that do not regulate federally authorized banking activities, see \u00a7 7.4000(a)(3), \"including, for example, criminal, tax, zoning, and labor and employment laws,\" Brief for Federal Respondent 15 (citing 69 Fed. Reg. 1896).</p>\n<p>Thus, although the text and history of visitation do not authoritatively support either party's construction of the statute, OCC's decision to adopt a more modest construction than could have been supported by the common-law and dictionary definition reinforces the reasonableness of its regulation. Put simply, OCC selected a permissible construction of a statutory term that was susceptible to multiple interpretations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Petitioner nonetheless argues that the original structure of the NBA compels us to adopt his reading of \"visitorial powers.\" When enacted in 1864, the \"visitorial powers\" clause was preceded by a statutory provision directing the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint persons \"to make a thorough examination into all the affairs of [every banking] association\" and to \"make a full and detailed report of the condition of the association to the comptroller.\" Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, \u00a7 54, 13 Stat. 116. In addition, the \"visitorial powers\" clause was succeeded by a sentence concerning the compensation due to the examiners. See <i>ibid.</i> Petitioner contends that the placement of the \"visitorial powers\" clause between these two provisions indicates that it originally meant to ban States only from conducting the particular type of \"thorough examination\" of banking affairs described in the neighboring provisions. And, petitioner adds, \u00a7 484 currently resides in the subchapter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2728</span> of the statute entitled \"Bank Examinations,\" which still includes a provision directing the Comptroller to appoint examiners \"to make a thorough examination of all the affairs of the bank and . . . make a full and detailed report of the condition of said bank to the Comptroller of the Currency.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 481.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's argument is undermined, however, by other structural attributes of this subchapter. In \u00a7 484(b), for example, Congress provided that \"[n]otwithstanding\" the statute's visitorial-powers prohibition, \"State auditors and examiners may. . . review [a national bank's] records solely to ensure compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or escheat laws.\" Such review does not fall within petitioner's definition of \"visitorial powers\" because the enforcement of state property laws is in no way associated with national bank examinations or internal operations. Thus, were \u00a7 484(a) to have the meaning petitioner assigns, there would have been no reason for Congress to identify the \u00a7 484(b) authority as an exception to \u00a7 484(a)'s \"visitorial powers\" prohibition, as the authority granted in \u00a7 484(b) would never have been eliminated by \u00a7 484(a).</p>\n<p>Other exceptions in \u00a7 484 also support OCC's construction of the statute. For example, \u00a7 484(a) includes an exception for visitations \"authorized by Federal law.\" One type of visitation authorized by law is described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3305(c), which provides that \"[n]othing contained in [\u00a7 484] shall prevent any State from requiring any national\" bank to provide payroll records and reports for unemployment tax purposes. Similarly, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 62 permits state tax officials to inspect national bank shareholder lists. Both provisions would be unnecessary if \"visitorial powers\" were limited to bank examinations and internal operations</p>\n<p>In sum, the NBA's structure does not compel the construction of \u00a7 484(a)'s text that petitioner advocates. If anything, given the manner in which Congress crafted exceptions to the \"visitorial powers\" ban in the statute, the opposite is true.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>The majority also accepts petitioner's contention that OCC's construction of \"visitorial powers\" is unreasonable because it conflicts with several of this Court's decisions. See <i>ante,</i> at 2716-2717. But petitioner cannot prevail by simply showing that this Court previously adopted a construction of \u00a7 484 that differs from the interpretation later chosen by the agency. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2729</span> \"A court's prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.\" <i>Brand X,</i> 545 U.S., at 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688. These decisions do not construe \u00a7 484 in a manner that trumps OCC's regulation.</p>\n<p>This Court's <i>only</i> decision directly addressing the meaning of \"visitorial powers\" is <i>Guthrie,</i> which held that the NBA did not prohibit a suit brought by a private shareholder seeking to inspect the books of a national bank, 199 U.S., at 157, 26 S.Ct. 4. In so holding, the Court contrasted \"the private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested\" with a visitor's \"public right\" to examine \"the conduct of the corporation with a view to keeping it within its legal powers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 158-159, 26 S.Ct. 4. <i>Guthrie</i> thus draws a line between enforcement of private rights and the public act of visitation that is consistent with the definition of visitation embraced by OCC. See <i>id.,</i> at 158, 26 S.Ct. 4 (\"In no case or authority that we have been able to find has there been a definition of this right, which would include the private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested . . .\"). The agency has never taken the position that the \"visitorial powers\" prohibition extends to private action.</p>\n<p>Nor does this Court's decision in <i>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri,</i> 263 U.S. 640, 44 S.Ct. 213, 68 L.Ed. 486 (1924) <i>(St.Louis),</i> foreclose OCC's construction of the statute. In that case, the State of Missouri brought a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding in state court \"to determine [the national bank's] authority to establish and conduct a branch bank in the City of St. Louis.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 655, 44 S.Ct. 213. The Court first held that federal law did not authorize national banks to engage in branch banking. See <i>id.,</i> at 656-659, 44 S.Ct. 213. \"Having determined that the power sought to be exercised by the bank finds no justification in any law or authority of the United States,\" the Court then concluded that \"the way is open for the enforcement of the state statute.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, see <i>ante,</i> at 2716-2717, and n. 2, that <i>St. Louis</i> stands for the proposition that a State retains the right to enforce any state law that is not substantively preempted with respect to national banks, see 263 U.S., at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213 (\"To demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law. . . . What the state is seeking to do is to vindicate and enforce its own law. . .\"). Under this view, then, because the New York fair lending laws are not substantively pre-empted, he is not exercising \"visitorial powers\" by enforcing them.</p>\n<p>Respondents counter that the holding of <i>St. Louis</i> is not so broad. In their view, the Court held only that a State may enforce its laws against a national bank when federal law grants the bank no authority to engage in the underlying activity at issue. See Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association 33-34. Here, federal law expressly authorizes national banks to make mortgage loans. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a). Thus, unlike in <i>St. Louis</i>\u0097in which the relevant state-law-proscribed conduct in a category that was wholly beyond the powers granted to national banks\u0097petitioner seeks to superintend the manner in which the national banks engage in activity expressly authorized by federal law. According to respondents, then, \u00a7 484(a)'s <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2730</span> ban on unauthorized visitation provides the \"controlling reason\" forbidding state enforcement that was absent from <i>St. Louis,</i> see 263 U.S., at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213.</p>\n<p>There is no need to decide which party has the better argument. The <i>St. Louis</i> decision nowhere references \u00a7 484(a) or addresses \"visitorial powers.\" Thus, as noted above, even if the decision is best read to support petitioner's view of the statute, that conclusion is insufficient to deny <i>Chevron</i> deference to OCC's construction of \u00a7 484(a). \"Since <i>Chevron</i> teaches that a court's opinion as to the best reading of an ambiguous statute an agency is charged with administering is not authoritative, the agency's decision to construe that statute differently from a court does not say that the court's holding was legally wrong. Instead, the agency may, consistent with the court's holding, choose a different construction, since the agency remains the authoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of such statutes.\" <i>Brand X,</i> 545 U.S., at 983, 125 S.Ct. 2688. A judicial decision that fails to directly confront the provision at issue cannot be deemed to have adopted the \"authoritative\" construction of the statute.<sup>[3]</sup> Petitioner's reliance on other decisions of this Court is misplaced for this very same reason. See <i>First Nat. Bank in Plant City v. Dickinson,</i> 396 U.S. 122, 90 S.Ct. 337, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1969); <i>Anderson Nat. Bank v. Luckett,</i> 321 U.S. 233, 64 S.Ct. 599, 88 L.Ed. 692 (1944); <i>First Nat. Bank of Bay City v. Fellows,</i> 244 U.S. 416, 37 S.Ct. 734, 61 L.Ed. 1233 (1917); <i>Easton v. Iowa,</i> 188 U.S. 220, 23 S.Ct. 288, 47 L.Ed. 452 (1903); <i>Waite v. Dowley,</i> 94 U.S. 527, 24 L.Ed. 181 (1877); <i>National Bank v. Commonwealth,</i> 9 Wall. 353, 19 L.Ed. 701 (1870). None of these decisions addressed the meaning of \"visitorial powers\" for purposes of \u00a7 484(a), let alone provided a definitive construction of the statute.</p>\n<p>Finally, this Court's decision in <i>Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A.,</i> 550 U.S. 1, 127 S.Ct. 1559, 167 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007), supports OCC's construction of the statute. <i>Watters</i> addressed whether the NBA preempted the application of certain Michigan laws to the mortgage-lending activities of an operating subsidiary of a national bank. See <i>id.,</i> at 7-8, 127 S.Ct. 1559. In deciding that issue, the Court did not reach the question presented here. But the Court was fully aware that the Michigan statutes granted state banking commissioners the very enforcement authority that petitioner seeks to exert over the national banks in this case. See <i>id.,</i> at 9-10, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (citing Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 445.1661 (West 2002), 493.56b (West Supp.2005)); see also 550 U.S., at 34, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (describing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2731</span> \u00a7\u00a7 445.1661 and 493.56b as \"state visitorial oversight\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>As the Court explained, although \"the Michigan provisions at issue exempt[ed] national banks from coverage . . . [t]his [was] not simply a matter of the Michigan Legislature's grace. For, as the parties recognize, the NBA would have preemptive force, <i>i.e.,</i> it would spare a national bank from state controls of the kind here involved.\" 550 U.S., at 13, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (citations omitted); see <i>ibid.</i> (explaining that \"real estate lending, when conducted by a national bank, is immune from state visitorial control\"). The Court's conclusion in <i>Watters</i> that \u00a7 484(a) deprives the States of inspection and enforcement authority over the mortgage-lending practices of national banks lends weight to the agency's construction of the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Petitioner also argues that three different background principles trigger a clear-statement rule that overcomes any <i>Chevron</i> deference to which OCC's construction of \u00a7 484 otherwise might be entitled. I disagree. None of petitioner's arguments provide a doctrinal basis for refusing to defer to the agency's reasonable construction of this statute.</p>\n<p>First, petitioner contends that OCC's regulation, which interprets \u00a7 484(a) to pre-empt state enforcement of state law but not the substantive state law itself, undermines important federalism principles and therefore triggers a requirement that Congress clearly state its pre-emptive intentions, see <i>Gregory v. Ashcroft,</i> 501 U.S. 452, 460, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991) (\"[I]f Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\" (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)). Petitioner is incorrect because OCC's construction of the statute does not alter the balance of power established by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>National banks are created by federal statute and therefore are subject to full congressional control. The States \"can exercise no control over them, nor in any wise affect their operation, except in so far as Congress may see proper to permit.\" <i>Farmers' and Mechanics' Nat. Bank v. Dearing,</i> 91 U.S. 29, 34, 23 L.Ed. 196 (1875); see also <i>Watters,</i> 550 U.S., at 10, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (\"Nearly 200 years ago, in <i>McCulloch v. Maryland,</i> 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819), this Court held federal law supreme over state law with respect to national banking\"). As a result, the only question presented by this case is whether Congress has seen it \"proper to permit\" the States to enforce state fair lending laws against national banks. OCC's reasonable conclusion that \u00a7 484(a) answers that question in the negative does not alter the federal-state balance; it simply preserves for OCC the oversight responsibilities assigned to it by Congress. See <i>id.,</i> at 22, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (\"Regulation of national <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2732</span> bank operations is a prerogative of Congress under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses. The Tenth Amendment, therefore, is not implicated here\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>Second, petitioner argues that a clear statement is required because \"the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress,\" <i>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</i> 331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947). There should be no presumption against pre-emption because Congress has expressly pre-empted state law in this case. See <i>Altria Group, Inc. v. Good,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 538, 556, 172 L.Ed.2d 398 (2008) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he presumption against pre-emption `dissolves once there is conclusive evidence of intent to pre-empt in the express words of the statute itself'\") (quoting <i>Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,</i> 505 U.S. 504, 545, 112 S.Ct. 2608, 120 L.Ed.2d 407 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)); see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 999, 1003, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008) (construing the express pre-emption provision of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c <i>et seq.,</i> without any reliance on the presumption against pre-emption).</p>\n<p>In any event, this presumption is \"not triggered when the State regulates in an area where there has been a history of significant federal presence.\" <i>United States v. Locke,</i> 529 U.S. 89, 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d 69 (2000). National banking is the paradigmatic example \"In defining the pre-emptive scope of statutes and regulations granting a power to national banks,\" this Court has taken the firm view that \"normally Congress would not want States to forbid, or to impair significantly, the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.\" <i>Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N.A. v. Nelson,</i> 517 U.S. 25, 33, 116 S.Ct. 1103, 134 L.Ed.2d 237 (1996). As a result, federal legislation concerning national banks is \"not normally limited by, but rather ordinarily preempt[s], contrary state law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 32, 116 S.Ct. 1103. As with general maritime law, Congress' \"legislat[ion] in th[is] field from the earliest days of the Republic\" and its creation of an \"extensive federal statutory and regulatory scheme\" means that an \"`assumption' of nonpre-emption is not triggered.\" <i>Locke, supra,</i> at 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135. That the States may also have legislated alongside Congress in this area, see <i>ante,</i> at 2720-2721, does not alter this conclusion, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Franklin Nat. Bank of Franklin Square v. New York,</i> 347 U.S. 373, 74 S.Ct. 550, 98 L.Ed. 767 (1954).</p>\n<p>Last, petitioner argues that <i>Chevron</i> deference is inapplicable because OCC's regulation declares the pre-emptive scope of the NBA. And, the majority flatly asserts that \"[i]f that is not pre-emption, nothing is.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2721. But OCC did not declare the pre-emptive scope of the statute; rather, it interpreted the term \"visitorial powers\" to encompass state enforcement of state fair lending laws. The pre-emption of state enforcement authority to which petitioner objects thus follows from the statute itself\u0097not agency action. See <i>Smiley,</i> 517 U.S., at 744, 116 S.Ct. 1730 (\"This argument confuses the question of the substantive (as opposed to pre-emptive) <i>meaning</i> of a statute with the question of <i>whether</i> a statute is pre-emptive. We may assume (without deciding) that the latter question must always be decided <i>de novo</i> by the courts. That is <i>not</i> the question at issue here; there is no doubt that \u00a7 85 pre-empts state law\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>Here, Congress\u0097not the agency\u0097has decided that \"[n]o national bank shall be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2733</span> subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a). Indeed, the majority agrees that it is the \"statutory term\"\u0097and not OCC's regulation\u0097that \"define[s] and thereby limit[s] the category of action reserved to the Federal Government and forbidden to the States.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2721. As a result, OCC has simply interpreted that term to encompass petitioner's decision to demand national bank records and threaten judicial enforcement of New York fair lending laws as a means of obtaining them. As <i>Smiley</i> showed, a federal agency's construction of an ambiguous statutory term may clarify the pre-emptive scope of enacted federal law, but that fact alone does not mean that it is the agency, rather than Congress, that has effected the pre-emption.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's federalism-based objections to <i>Chevron</i> deference ultimately turn on a single proposition: It is doubtful that Congress pre-empted state enforcement of state laws but not the underlying state laws themselves. But it is not this Court's task to decide whether the statutory scheme established by Congress is unusual or even \"[b]izarre.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 2718. The Court must decide only whether the construction adopted by the agency is unambiguously foreclosed by the statute's text. Here, the text, structure, and history of \"visitorial powers\" support the agency's reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 484. Petitioner has not identified any constitutional principle that would require Congress to take the greater step of pre-empting all enforcement of state lending laws (including private enforcement) even though its central concern was the allocation of the right to exercise public visitation over national bank activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For all these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Justice THOMAS's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part (hereinafter the dissent) attempts to distinguish <i>Dartmouth College</i> on the ground that the college was a charitable corporation, whose visitors (unlike the State as visitor of for-profit corporations) had no law-enforcement power. See <i>post,</i> at 2725-2726, n. 1. We doubt that was so. As Justice Story's opinion in <i>Dartmouth College</i> stated, visitors of charitable corporations had \"power . . . to correct all irregularities and abuses,\" 4 Wheat., at 673, 4 L.Ed. 629, which would surely include operations in violation of law. But whether or not visitors of charitable corporations had law-enforcement powers, the powers that they <i>did</i> possess demonstrate that visitation is different from ordinary law enforcement. Indeed, if those powers did not include the power to assure compliance with law that demonstration would be all the more forceful.</p>\n<p>[2]  The dissent attempts to distinguish <i>St. Louis</i> by invoking the principle that an agency is free to depart from a court's interpretation of the law. <i>Post,</i> at 2730-2731 (citing <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,</i> 545 U.S. 967, 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005)). This again misses the point. <i>St. Louis</i> is relevant to proper interpretation of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a) not because it is authoritative on the question whether States can enforce their banking laws, but because it is one in a long and unbroken line of cases distinguishing visitation from law enforcement. Respondents contend that <i>St. Louis</i> holds only that States can enforce their law when federal law grants the national bank no authority to engage in the activity at issue. Even if that were true it would make no difference. The case would still stand for the proposition that the exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from enforcing their law.</p>\n<p>[3]  We reject respondents' contention that the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, \u00a7 102(f)(1)(B), 108 Stat. 2349, 2350, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(B), establishes that the Comptroller's visitorial power pre-empts state law enforcement. That provision states that some state laws respecting bank branching \"shall be enforced\" by the Comptroller. We need not decide here whether converting the Comptroller's visitorial <i>power</i> to assure compliance with all applicable laws, see <i>infra,</i> at 2720, into an <i>obligation</i> to assure compliance with certain state laws preempts state enforcement of those particular laws. Even if it had that effect it would shed no light on the meaning of \"visitorial powers\" in the National Bank Act, a statute that it does not refer to and that was enacted more than a century earlier.</p>\n<p>[4]  The prohibition is not entirely categorical only because it is subject to the phrase at the end of the sentence (applicable to all of the regulation's enumerated \"visitorial powers\" forbidden to the States): \"except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\" This replicates a similar exception contained in \u00a7 484(a) itself (\"No national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law\"), and certainly does not refer to case law finding state action nonpre-empted. If it meant that, \u00a7 484(a)'s apparent limitation of visitorial powers would be illusory\u0097saying, in effect, that national banks are subject to only those visitorial powers that the courts say they are subject to. Cases that find state action nonpre-empted might perhaps be described as \"permitting\" the state action in question, but hardly as \"authorizing\" it. In both the statutory and regulation context, \"federal law\" obviously means federal statutes.</p>\n<p>[5]  All of these cases were decided before Congress added to \u00a7 484 its current subsection (b), which authorizes \"State auditors and examiners\" to review national-bank records to assure compliance with state unclaimed-property and escheat laws. See 96 Stat. 1521.</p>\n<p>[1]  By looking to Justice Story's concurrence in <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> 4 Wheat. 518, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819), for authoritative guidance, see <i>ante,</i> at 2716-2717, the majority seemingly rejects the distinction between the visitor's role in supervising civil corporations and the visitor's far more limited role in supervising private institutions such as churches, universities, and charitable organizations. See <i>ante,</i> at 2716, n. 1. In <i>Woodward,</i> the Court addressed the scope of the visitor's authority over a private college\u0097not a civil corporation. See 4 Wheat., at 562-563, 4 L.Ed. 629 (\"The corporation in question is not a <i>civil,</i> although it is a <i>lay</i> corporation. It is an <i>eleemosynary</i> corporation. . . . Eleemosynary corporations are for the management of private property, according to the will of the donors. They are private corporations\" (emphasis in original)). Visitors historically did not have \"law enforcement power\" over churches, universities, and charitable organizations. See <i>supra,</i> at 2716-2717. But there is strong evidence that visitors of civil corporations\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> sovereigns\u0097were so empowered. See <i>supra,</i> at 2717-2718. The distinction between these species of visitation is crucial because it yields divergent understandings as to the scope of the visitor's power to enforce generally applicable laws in court. Moreover, the majority's failure to confront this important difference leaves a gap in its historical analysis that, in turn, undermines its conclusion that OCC's interpretation of \u00a7 484(a) was unreasonable.</p>\n<p>[2]  Contrary to the majority's conclusion, see <i>ante,</i> at 2718, n. 3, petitioner's structural argument is also undermined by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal), 108 Stat. 2338, which authorized national banks to operate interstate branches. The statute provides that \"[t]he laws of the host State regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and establishment of intrastate branches shall apply to any branch in the host State of an out-of-State national bank to the same extent as such State laws apply to a branch of a bank chartered by that State\" unless federal law separately preempts their application or the Comptroller determines that application of the state law would have a \"discriminatory effect\" on the national bank branch. See <i>id.,</i> at 2349-2350, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(A). Riegle-Neal further provides that \"[t]he provisions of any State law to which a branch of a national bank is subject under this paragraph shall be enforced, with respect to such branch, by the Comptroller of the Currency.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 2350, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(B). The United States has interpreted the \"shall be enforced\" language to provide OCC with exclusive enforcement authority. See Brief for Federal Respondent 46-48. This construction reinforces OCC's interpretation of \u00a7 484(a). If OCC has exclusive authority to enforce state law with respect to interstate branches of national banks, it would be reasonable to interpret the statute to operate similarly with respect to the national banks themselves.</p>\n<p>[3]  The majority's suggestion that the Court's decision in <i>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri,</i> 263 U.S. 640, 44 S.Ct. 213, 68 L.Ed. 486 (1924), is not \"authoritative\" falls short of the mark. See <i>ante,</i> at 2717, n. 2; see, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 2717-2718 (\"[R]eading `visitorial powers' as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result\u0097the precise result contemplated by our opinion in <i>St. Louis</i>\"). According to the majority, irrespective of which party has the better reading of that case, it \"would still stand for the proposition that the exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from enforcing their law.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2717, n. 2. But that conclusion rests on the assumption that the <i>St. Louis</i> Court shared the majority's conception of law enforcement and visitation as categorically distinct for purposes of \u00a7 484(a). It is impossible to verify that assumption, however, because the bank never raised the \"visitorial powers\" defense in that case. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 6. If the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine is to have any interpretative value, an agency's construction of a statute cannot be foreclosed by a prior judicial decision in which the provision in question was neither raised by the parties nor passed upon by the court.</p>\n<p>[4]  The majority contends that <i>Watters</i> is \"fully in accord with the well established distinction between supervision and law enforcement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2717. But this argument ignores the reach of the statutes that the Court assumed were visitorial in <i>Watters.</i> The Michigan laws at issue in <i>Watters</i> allowed for much more than \"`general supervision and control'\" of the operating subsidiaries of national banks. <i>Ante,</i> at 2717. They also included provisions permitting the state attorney general to \"take any appropriate legal action to enjoin the operation of the business\" and allowing the commissioner \"[t]o bring an action in . . . circuit court in the name and on behalf of this state\" to enjoin \"any unsafe or injurious practice or act in violation of this act or a rule promulgated under this act.\" Mich.

Argued April 28, 2009\u2014Decided June 29, 2009\nTo determine whether various national banks had violated New York\u2019s\n  fair-lending laws, the State\u2019s Attorney General, whose successor in\n  office is the petitioner here, sent them letters in 2005 requesting \u201cin\n  lieu of subpoena\u201d that they provide certain nonpublic information\n  about their lending practices. Respondents, the federal Office of the\n  Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller or OCC) and a banking\n  trade group, brought suit to enjoin the information request, claiming\n  that the Comptroller\u2019s regulation promulgated under the National\n  Bank Act (NBA) prohibits that form of state law enforcement against\n  national banks. The District Court entered an injunction prohibiting\n  the Attorney General from enforcing state fair-lending laws through\n  demands for records or judicial proceedings. The Second Circuit af\n  firmed.\nHeld: The Comptroller\u2019s regulation purporting to pre-empt state law\n enforcement is not a reasonable interpretation of the NBA. Pp. 2\u201315.\n    (a) Evidence from the time of the NBA\u2019s enactment, this Court\u2019s\n cases, and application of normal construction principles make clear\n that the NBA does not prohibit ordinary enforcement of state law.\n Pp. 2\u201311.\n      (i) The NBA provides: \u201cNo national bank shall be subject to any\n visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in the\n courts . . . , or . . . directed by Congress.\u201d 12 U. S. C. \u00a7484(a). Among\n other things, the Comptroller\u2019s regulation implementing \u00a7484(a) for\n bids States to \u201cexercise visitorial powers with respect to national\n banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the\n production of books or records,\u201d or, as here pertinent, \u201cprosecuting\n enforcement actions\u201d \u201cexcept in limited circumstances authorized by\n2            CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    federal law.\u201d 12 CFR \u00a77.4000(a)(1). There is some ambiguity in the\n    NBA\u2019s term \u201cvisitorial powers,\u201d and the Comptroller can give authori\n    tative meaning to the term within the bounds of that uncertainty.\n    Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\n    U. S. 837. However, the presence of some uncertainty does not ex\n    pand Chevron deference to cover virtually any interpretation of the\n    NBA. Pp. 2\u20133.\n         (ii) When the NBA was enacted in 1864, scholars and courts un\n    derstood \u201cvisitation\u201d to refer to the sovereign\u2019s supervisory power\n    over the manner in which corporations conducted business, see, e.g.,\n    Guthrie v. Harkness, 199 U. S. 148, 157. That power allowed the\n    States to use the prerogative writs to exercise control if a corporation\n    abused its lawful power, acted adversely to the public, or created a\n    nuisance. Pp. 3\u20134.\n         (iii) This Court\u2019s consistent teaching, both before and after the\n    NBA\u2019s enactment, is that a sovereign\u2019s \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d and its\n    power to enforce the law are two different things. See, e.g., Trustees\n    of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 676, 681; Guthrie,\n    supra, at 159, 157; First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, 263 U. S.\n    640, 660. Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N. A., 550 U. S. 1, 21, distin\n    guished. And contrary to the Comptroller\u2019s regulation, the NBA pre\n    empts only the former. Pp. 4\u20137.\n         (iv) The regulation\u2019s consequences also cast its validity into\n    doubt: Even the OCC acknowledges that the NBA leaves in place\n    some state substantive laws affecting banks, yet the Comptroller\u2019s\n    rule says that the State may not enforce its valid, non-pre-empted\n    laws against national banks. \u201cTo demonstrate the binding quality of\n    a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made\n    apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is\n    essentially inherent in the very conception of law.\u201d St. Louis, supra,\n    at 660. In contrast, channeling state attorneys general into judicial\n    law-enforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to exercise\n    \u201cvisitorial\u201d oversight) would preserve a regime of exclusive adminis\n    trative oversight by the Comptroller while honoring in fact rather\n    than merely in theory Congress\u2019s decision not to pre-empt substan\n    tive state law. This reading is also suggested by \u00a7484(a)\u2019s otherwise\n    inexplicable reservation of state powers \u201cvested in the courts of jus\n    tice.\u201d And on a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and\n    law enforcement is clear: If a State chooses to pursue enforcement of\n    its laws in court, its targets are protected by discovery and proce\n    dural rules. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (b) The Comptroller\u2019s interpretation of the regulation demonstrates\n    its own flaw: the Comptroller is forced to limit the regulation\u2019s sweep\n    in areas such as contract enforcement and debt collection, but those\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  exceptions rest upon neither the regulation\u2019s nor the NBA\u2019s text. Pp.\n  9\u201311.\n     (c) The dissent\u2019s objections are addressed and rejected. Pp. 11\u201313.\n     (d) Under the foregoing principles, the Comptroller reasonably in\n  terpreted the NBA\u2019s \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d term to include \u201cconducting\n  examinations [and] inspecting or requiring the production of books or\n  records of national banks,\u201d when the State conducts those activities\n  as supervisor of corporations. When, however, a state attorney gen\n  eral brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not\n  acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather sovereign-as\n  law-enforcer. Because such a lawsuit is not an exercise of \u201cvisitorial\n  powers,\u201d the Comptroller erred by extending that term to include\n  \u201cprosecuting enforcement actions\u201d in state courts. In this case, the\n  Attorney General\u2019s threatened action was not the bringing of a civil\n  suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant based on probable\n  cause, but the issuance of subpoena on his own authority if his re\n  quest for information was not voluntarily honored. That is not the\n  exercise of the law enforcement power \u201cvested in the courts of jus\n  tice,\u201d which the NBA exempts from the ban on the exercise of super\n  visory power. Accordingly, the injunction below is affirmed as ap\n  plied to the Attorney General\u2019s threatened issuance of executive\n  subpoenas, but vacated insofar as it prohibits the Attorney General\n  from bringing judicial enforcement actions.

He\nsought this information to determine whether the banks\nhad violated the State\u2019s fair-lending laws. Spitzer\u2019s suc\ncessor in office, Andrew Cuomo, is the petitioner here.\nRespondents, the federal Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (\u201cComptroller\u201d or \u201cOCC\u201d) and the Clearing\nHouse Association, a banking trade group, brought suit to\nenjoin the information request, claiming that the Comp\ntroller\u2019s regulation promulgated under the National Bank\nAct prohibits that form of state law enforcement against\nnational banks.\n   The United States District Court for the Southern Dis\ntrict of New York entered an injunction in favor of respon\ndents, prohibiting the attorney general from enforcing\nstate fair-lending laws through demands for records or\njudicial proceedings. The United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit affirmed. 510 F. 3d 105 (2007). We\ngranted certiorari. 555 U. S. ___ (2009). The question\npresented is whether the Comptroller\u2019s regulation pur\nporting to pre-empt state law enforcement can be upheld\n2        CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nas a reasonable interpretation of the National Bank Act.\n                             I\n Section 484(a) of Title 12, U. S. C., a provision of the\nNational Bank Act, 13 Stat. 99, reads as follows:\n      \u201cNo national bank shall be subject to any visitorial\n    powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in\n    the courts of justice or such as shall be, or have been\n    exercised or directed by Congress or by either House\n    thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either\n    House duly authorized.\u201d\nThe Comptroller, charged with administering the National\nBank Act, adopted, through notice-and-comment rulemak\ning, the regulation at issue here designed to implement\nthe statutory provision. Its principal provisions read as\nfollows:\n    \u201c\u00a77.4000 Visitorial powers.\n       \u201c(a) General rule. (1) Only the OCC or an author\n    ized representative of the OCC may exercise visitorial\n    powers with respect to national banks, except as pro\n    vided in paragraph (b) of this section. State officials\n    may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to na\n    tional banks, such as conducting examinations, in\n    specting or requiring the production of books or re\n    cords of national banks, or prosecuting enforcement\n    actions, except in limited circumstances authorized by\n    federal law. However, production of a bank\u2019s records\n    (other than non-public OCC information under 12\n    CFR part 4, subpart C) may be required under normal\n    judicial procedures.\n       \u201c(2) For purposes of this section, visitorial powers\n    include:\n       \u201c(i) Examination of a bank;\n       \u201c(ii) Inspection of a bank\u2019s books and records;\n       \u201c(iii) Regulation and supervision of activities au\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837\n(1984). There is necessarily some ambiguity as to the\nmeaning of the statutory term \u201cvisitorial powers,\u201d espe\ncially since we are working in an era when the prerogative\nwrits\u2014through which visitorial powers were traditionally\nenforced\u2014are not in vogue. The Comptroller can give\nauthoritative meaning to the statute within the bounds of\nthat uncertainty. But the presence of some uncertainty\ndoes not expand Chevron deference to cover virtually any\ninterpretation of the National Bank Act. We can discern\nthe outer limits of the term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d even\nthrough the clouded lens of history. They do not include,\nas the Comptroller\u2019s expansive regulation would provide,\nordinary enforcement of the law. Evidence from the time\nof the statute\u2019s enactment, a long line of our own cases,\nand application of normal principles of construction to the\nNational Bank Act make that clear.\n                              A\n   Historically, the sovereign\u2019s right of visitation over\ncorporations paralleled the right of the church to supervise\nits institutions and the right of the founder of a charitable\ninstitution \u201cto see that [his] property [was] rightly em\nployed,\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 469 (1765). By extension of this principle, \u201c[t]he\n4         CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nking [was] by law the visitor of all civil corporations,\u201d ibid.\nA visitor could inspect and control the visited institution\nat will.\n   When the National Bank Act was enacted in 1864,\n\u201cvisitation\u201d was accordingly understood as \u201c[t]he act of\nexamining into the affairs of a corporation\u201d by \u201cthe gov\nernment itself.\u201d 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 790 (15th\ned. 1883). Lower courts understood \u201cvisitation\u201d to mean\n\u201cthe act of a superior or superintending officer, who visits\na corporation to examine into its manner of conducting\nbusiness, and enforce an observance of its laws and regu\nlations.\u201d First Nat. Bank of Youngstown v. Hughes, 6 F.\n737, 740 (CC ND Ohio 1881). A State was the \u201cvisitor\u201d of\nall companies incorporated in the State, simply by virtue\nof the State\u2019s role as sovereign: The \u201clegislature is the\nvisitor of all corporations founded by it.\u201d Guthrie v. Hark\nness, 199 U. S. 148, 157 (1905) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   This relationship between sovereign and corporation\nwas understood to allow the States to use prerogative\nwrits\u2014such as mandamus and quo warranto\u2014to exercise\ncontrol \u201cwhenever a corporation [wa]s abusing the power\ngiven it, or, . . . or acting adversely to the public, or creat\ning a nuisance.\u201d H. Wilgus, Private Corporations, in 8\nAmerican Law and Procedure \u00a7157, pp. 224\u2013225 (1910).\nState visitorial commissions were authorized to \u201cexercise\na general supervision\u201d over companies in the State.\nI.

Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518,\n676, 681 (1819) (concurring opinion). This power of \u201cgen\nera[l] superintend[ence]\u201d stood in contrast to action by the\ncourt of chancery, which acted \u201cnot as itself possessing a\nvisitorial power . . . but as possessing a general jurisdic\ntion . . . to redress grievances, and frauds.\u201d Id., at 676.1\n   In Guthrie, supra, we held that a shareholder acting in\nhis role as a private individual was not exercising a \u201cvisi\ntorial power\u201d under the National Bank Act when he peti\ntioned a court to force the production of corporate records,\nid., at 159. \u201c[C]ontrol in the courts of justice,\u201d we said, is\nnot visitorial, and we drew a contrast between the nonvisi\ntorial act of \u201csu[ing] in the courts of the State\u201d and the\nvisitorial \u201csupervision of the Comptroller of the Currency,\u201d\nid., at 159, 157.\n   In First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, 263 U. S.\n640 (1924), we upheld the right of the Attorney General of\nMissouri to bring suit to enforce a state anti-bank\nbranching law against a national bank. We said that only\nthe United States may perform visitorial administrative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part\n\n(hereinafter the dissent) attempts to distinguish Dartmouth College on\nthe ground that the college was a charitable corporation, whose visitors\n(unlike the State as visitor of for-profit corporations) had no law\nenforcement power. See post, at 7, n. 1. We doubt that was so. As\nJustice Story\u2019s opinion in Dartmouth College stated, visitors of charita\nble corporations had \u201cpower . . . to correct all irregularities and abuses,\u201d\n4 Wheat., at 673, which would surely include operations in violation of\nlaw. But whether or not visitors of charitable corporations had law\nenforcement powers, the powers that they did possess demonstrate that\nvisitation is different from ordinary law enforcement. Indeed, if those\npowers did not include the power to assure compliance with law that\ndemonstration would be all the more forceful.\n6           CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\noversight, such as \u201cinquir[ing] by quo warranto whether a\nnational bank is acting in excess of its charter powers.\u201d\nId., at 660. But if a state statute of general applicability is\nnot substantively pre-empted, then \u201cthe power of enforce\nment must rest with the [State] and not with\u201d the Na\ntional Government, ibid.2\n   Our most recent decision, Watters v. Wachovia Bank,\nN. A., 550 U. S. 1 (2007), does not, as the dissent contends,\npost, at 18, \u201csuppor[t] OCC\u2019s construction of the statute.\u201d\nTo the contrary, it is fully in accord with the well estab\nlished distinction between supervision and law enforce\nment. Watters held that a State may not exercise \u201c \u2018gen\neral supervision and control\u2019 \u201d over a subsidiary of a\nnational bank, 550 U. S., at 8, because \u201cmultiple audits\nand surveillance under rival oversight regimes\u201d would\ncause uncertainty, id., at 21. \u201c[G]eneral supervision and\ncontrol\u201d and \u201coversight\u201d are worlds apart from law en\nforcement. All parties to the case agreed that Michigan\u2019s\ngeneral oversight regime could not be imposed on national\nbanks; the sole question was whether operating subsidiar\nies of national banks enjoyed the same immunity from\nstate visitation. The opinion addresses and answers no\nother question.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        dissent attempts to distinguish St. Louis by invoking the prin\nciple that an agency is free to depart from a court\u2019s interpretation of the\nlaw. Post, at 16\u201317 (citing National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.\nv. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982 (2005)). This again\nmisses the point. St. Louis is relevant to proper interpretation of 12\nU. S. C. \u00a7484(a) not because it is authoritative on the question whether\nStates can enforce their banking laws, but because it is one in a long\nand unbroken line of cases distinguishing visitation from law enforce\nment. Respondents contend that St. Louis holds only that States can\nenforce their law when federal law grants the national bank no author\nity to engage in the activity at issue. Even if that were true it would\nmake no difference. The case would still stand for the proposition that\nthe exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from\nenforcing their law.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The foregoing cases all involve enforcement of state law.\nBut if the Comptroller\u2019s exclusive exercise of visitorial\npowers precluded law enforcement by the States, it would\nalso preclude law enforcement by federal agencies. Of\ncourse it does not. See, e.g., Bank of America Nat. Trust &\nSav. Assn. v. Douglas, 105 F. 2d 100, 105\u2013106 (CADC\n1939) (Securities Exchange Commission investigation of\nbank fraud is not an exercise of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d); Peo\nples Bank of Danville v. Williams, 449 F. Supp. 254, 260\n(WD Va. 1978) (same).\n  In sum, the unmistakable and utterly consistent teach\ning of our jurisprudence, both before and after enactment\nof the National Bank Act, is that a sovereign\u2019s \u201cvisitorial\npowers\u201d and its power to enforce the law are two different\nthings. There is not a credible argument to the contrary.\nAnd contrary to what the Comptroller\u2019s regulation says,\nthe National Bank Act pre-empts only the former.\n                            C\n   The consequences of the regulation also cast doubt upon\nits validity. No one denies that the National Bank Act\nleaves in place some state substantive laws affecting\nbanks. See Brief for Federal Respondent 20; Brief for\nRespondent Clearing House Association, L. L. C. 29; post,\nat 16\u201317. But the Comptroller\u2019s rule says that the State\nmay not enforce its valid, non-pre-empted laws against\nnational banks. Ibid. The bark remains, but the bite does\nnot.\n   The dissent admits, with considerable understatement,\nthat such a result is \u201cunusual,\u201d ibid. \u201cBizarre\u201d would be\nmore apt. As the Court said in St. Louis:\n    \u201cTo demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but\n    deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made\n    apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for\n    such power is essentially inherent in the very concep\n    tion of law.\u201d 263 U. S., at 660.\n8          CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nIn sharp contrast to the \u201cunusual\u201d reading propounded by\nthe Comptroller\u2019s regulation, reading \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d as\nlimiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would\nproduce an entirely commonplace result\u2014the precise\nresult contemplated by our opinion in St. Louis, which\nsaid that if a state statute is valid as to national banks,\n\u201cthe corollary that it is obligatory and enforceable neces\nsarily results.\u201d Id., at 659\u2013660 (emphasis added). Chan\nneling state attorneys general into judicial law\nenforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to\nexercise \u201cvisitorial\u201d oversight) would preserve a regime of\nexclusive administrative oversight by the Comptroller\nwhile honoring in fact rather than merely in theory Con\ngress\u2019s decision not to pre-empt substantive state law.\nThis system echoes many other mixed state/federal re\ngimes in which the Federal Government exercises general\noversight while leaving state substantive law in place.\nSee, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n  This reading is also suggested by \u00a7484(a)\u2019s otherwise\ninexplicable reservation of state powers \u201cvested in the\ncourts of justice.\u201d As described earlier, visitation was\nnormally conducted through use of the prerogative writs of\nmandamus and quo warranto. The exception could not\npossibly exempt that manner of exercising visitation, or\nelse the exception would swallow the rule. Its only con\nceivable purpose is to preserve normal civil and criminal\nlawsuits. To be sure, the reservation of powers \u201cvested in\nthe courts of justice\u201d is phrased as an exception from the\nprohibition of visitorial powers. But as we have just dis\ncussed, it cannot possibly be that, and it is explicable only\nas an attempt to make clear that the courts\u2019 ordinary\npowers of enforcing the law are not affected. 3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 We reject respondents\u2019 contention that the Riegle-Neal Interstate\n\nBanking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, \u00a7102(f)(1)(B), 108 Stat.\n2349, 2350, 12 U. S. C. \u00a736(f)(1)(B), establishes that the Comptroller\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   On a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation\nand law enforcement is clear. If a State chooses to pursue\nenforcement of its laws in court, then it is not exercising\nits power of visitation and will be treated like a litigant.\nAn attorney general acting as a civil litigant must file a\nlawsuit, survive a motion to dismiss, endure the rules of\nprocedure and discovery, and risk sanctions if his claim is\nfrivolous or his discovery tactics abusive. Judges are\ntrusted to prevent \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d or an undirected\nrummaging through bank books and records for evidence\nof some unknown wrongdoing. In New York, civil discov\nery is far more limited than the full range of \u201cvisitorial\npowers\u201d that may be exercised by a sovereign. Courts may\nenter protective orders to prevent \u201cunreasonable annoy\nance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other\nprejudice,\u201d N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a73103(a) (West\n2005), and may supervise discovery sua sponte, \u00a73104(a).\nA visitor, by contrast, may inspect books and records at\nany time for any or no reason.\n                              II\n  The Comptroller\u2019s regulation, therefore, does not com\nport with the statute. Neither does the Comptroller\u2019s\ninterpretation of its regulation, which differs from the text\nand must be discussed separately.\n  Evidently realizing that exclusion of state enforcement\nof all state laws against national banks is too extreme to\nbe contemplated, the Comptroller sought to limit the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nvisitorial power pre-empts state law enforcement. That provision\nstates that some state laws respecting bank branching \u201cshall be en\nforced\u201d by the Comptroller. We need not decide here whether convert\ning the Comptroller\u2019s visitorial power to assure compliance with all\napplicable laws, see infra, at 12, into an obligation to assure compliance\nwith certain state laws preempts state enforcement of those particular\nlaws. Even if it had that effect it would shed no light on the meaning of\n\u201cvisitorial powers\u201d in the National Bank Act, a statute that it does not\nrefer to and that was enacted more than a century earlier.\n10          CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsweep of its regulation by the following passage set forth\nin the agency\u2019s statement of basis and purpose in the\nFederal Register:\n     \u201cWhat the case law does recognize is that \u2018states re\n     tain some power to regulate national banks in areas\n     such as contracts, debt collection, acquisition and\n     transfer of property, and taxation, zoning, criminal,\n     and tort law.\u2019 [citing a Ninth Circuit case.] Applica\n     tion of these laws to national banks and their imple\n     mentation by state authorities typically does not af\n     fect the content or extent of the Federally-authorized\n     business of banking . . . but rather establishes the le\n     gal infrastructure that surrounds and supports the\n     ability of national banks . . . to do business.\u201d 69 Fed.\n     Reg. 1896 (2004) (footnote omitted).\n  This cannot be reconciled with the regulation\u2019s almost\ncategorical prohibition in 12 CFR \u00a77.4000(a)(1) of \u201cprose\ncuting enforcement actions.\u201d4 Nor can it be justified by the\nprovision in subsection (a)(2)(iv) which defines visitorial\npowers to include \u201c[e]nforcing compliance with any appli\ncable . . . state laws concerning\u201d \u201cactivities authorized or\npermitted      pursuant    to    federal    banking    law,\u201d\n\u00a77.4000(a)(2)(iii). The latter phrase cannot be interpreted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The prohibition is not entirely categorical only because it is subject\nto the phrase at the end of the sentence (applicable to all of the regula\ntion\u2019s enumerated \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d forbidden to the States): \u201cexcept\nin limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\u201d This replicates a\nsimilar exception contained in \u00a7484(a) itself (\u201cNo national bank shall be\nsubject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law\u201d),\nand certainly does not refer to case law finding state action nonpre\nempted. If it meant that, \u00a7484(a)\u2019s apparent limitation of visitorial\npowers would be illusory\u2014saying, in effect, that national banks are\nsubject to only those visitorial powers that the courts say they are\nsubject to. Cases that find state action nonpre-empted might perhaps\nbe described as \u201cpermitting\u201d the state action in question, but hardly as\n\u201cauthorizing\u201d it. In both the statutory and regulation context, \u201cfederal\nlaw\u201d obviously means federal statutes.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto include only distinctively banking activities (leaving the\nStates free to enforce nonbanking state laws), because if it\nwere so interpreted subsection (a)(2)(iii), which uses the\nsame terminology, would limit the Comptroller\u2019s exclusive\nvisitorial power of \u201cregulation and supervision\u201d to distinc\ntively banking activities\u2014which no one thinks is the case.\nAnyway, the National Bank Act does specifically authorize\nand permit activities that fall within what the statement\nof basis and purpose calls \u201cthe legal infrastructure that\nsurrounds and supports the ability of national banks . . . to\ndo business.\u201d See, e.g., 12 U. S. C. \u00a724 Third (power to\nmake contracts); \u00a724 Seventh (\u201call such incidental powers\nas shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking\u201d).\nAnd of course a distinction between \u201cimplementation\u201d of\n\u201cinfrastructure\u201d and judicial enforcement of other laws can\nbe found nowhere within the text of the statute. This\npassage in the statement of basis and purpose, resting\nupon neither the text of the regulation nor the text of the\nstatute, attempts to do what Congress declined to do:\nexempt national banks from all state banking laws, or at\nleast state enforcement of those laws.\n                             III\n   The dissent fails to persuade us. Its fundamental con\ntention\u2014that the exclusive grant of visitorial powers can\nbe interpreted to preclude state enforcement of state\nlaws\u2014rests upon a logical fallacy. The dissent estab\nlishes, post, at 8\u20139 (and we do not at all contest), that in\nthe course of exercising visitation powers the sovereign\ncan compel compliance with the law. But it concludes\nfrom that, post, at 11, that any sovereign attempt to com\npel compliance with the law can be deemed an exercise of\nthe visitation power. That conclusion obviously does not\nfollow. For example, in the course of exercising its visita\ntion powers, the sovereign can assuredly compel a bank to\nhonor obligations that are in default. Does that mean that\n12        CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sovereign\u2019s taking the same action in executing a civil\njudgment for payment of those obligations can be consid\nered an exercise of the visitation power? Of course not.\nMany things can be compelled through the visitation\npower that can be compelled through the exercise of other\nsovereign power as well. The critical question is not what\nis being compelled, but what sovereign power has been\ninvoked to compel it. And the power to enforce the law\nexists separate and apart from the power of visitation.\n    The dissent argues that the Comptroller\u2019s expansive\nreading of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d does not intrude upon the,\n\u201c \u2018the historic police powers of the States,\u2019 \u201d post, at 20,\n(quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,\n230 (1947)), because, like federal maritime law, federal\ninvolvement in this field dates to \u201c \u2018the earliest days of the\nRepublic,\u2019 \u201d post, at 21 (quoting United States v. Locke, 529\nU. S. 89, 108 (2000). For that reason, the dissent con\ncludes, this case does not raise the sort of federalism\nconcerns that prompt a presumption against pre-emption.\nWe have not invoked the presumption against pre\nemption, and think it unnecessary to do so in giving force\nto the plain terms of the National Bank Act. Neither,\nhowever, should the incursion that the Comptroller\u2019s\nregulation makes upon traditional state powers be mini\nmized. Although the sovereign visitorial power of assur\ning national-bank compliance with all laws inhered in the\nFederal Government from the time of its creation of na\ntional banks, the Comptroller was not given authority to\nenforce nonpre-empted state laws until 1966. See Finan\ncial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966, Tit. III, 80 Stat.\n1046\u20131055. A power first exercised during the lifetime of\nevery current Justice is hardly involvement \u201cfrom the\nearliest days of the Republic.\u201d\n    States, on the other hand, have always enforced their\ngeneral laws against national banks\u2014and have enforced\ntheir banking-related laws against national banks for at\n                   Cite as: 557 U.

That is much too kind. It is not without reason that\nthe regulation is contained within a subpart of the Comp\ntroller\u2019s regulations on Bank Activities and Operations\nthat is entitled \u201cPreemption.\u201d The purpose and function of\nthe statutory term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is to define and\nthereby limit the category of action reserved to the Federal\nGovernment and forbidden to the States. Any interpreta\ntion of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d necessarily \u201cdeclares the pre\nemptive scope of the NBA,\u201d ibid.

If that is not pre-emption,\nnothing is.\n                               IV\n   Applying the foregoing principles to this case is not\ndifficult. \u201cVisitorial powers\u201d in the National Bank Act\nrefers to a sovereign\u2019s supervisory powers over corpora\ntions. They include any form of administrative oversight\nthat allows a sovereign to inspect books and records on\ndemand, even if the process is mediated by a court\nthrough prerogative writs or similar means. The Comp\ntroller reasonably interpreted this statutory term to in\nclude \u201cconducting examinations [and] inspecting or requir\ning the production of books or records of national banks,\u201d\n\u00a77.4000, when the State conducts those activities in its\ncapacity as supervisor of corporations.\n   When, however, a state attorney general brings suit to\nenforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting\nin the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the\nrole of sovereign-as-law-enforcer. Such a lawsuit is not an\nexercise of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d and thus the Comptroller\nerred by extending the definition of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d to\ninclude \u201cprosecuting enforcement actions\u201d in state courts,\n\u00a77.4000.\n   The request for information in the present case was\nstated to be \u201cin lieu of\u201d other action; implicit was the\nthreat that if the request was not voluntarily honored,\nthat other action would be taken. All parties have as\nsumed, and we agree, that if the threatened action would\nhave been unlawful the request-cum-threat could be en\njoined. Here the threatened action was not the bringing of\na civil suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant\nbased on probable cause, but rather the Attorney Gen\neral\u2019s issuance of subpoena on his own authority under\nNew York Executive Law, which permits such subpoenas\nin connection with his investigation of \u201crepeated fraudu\nlent or illegal acts . . . in the carrying on, conducting or\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Based on this definition, the Court concludes\nthat \u00a7484(a) does not pre-empt a \u201cstate attorney gen\neral[\u2019s] . . . suit to enforce state law against a national\nbank.\u201d Ibid. I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 deter\nminations that the term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is ambiguous\nand that it was reasonable for the Office of the Comptrol\nler of the Currency (OCC) to interpret the term to encom\npass state efforts to obtain national bank records and to\nenforce state fair lending laws against national banks.\nAccordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in\npart.\n2         CUOMO v.

OCC further concluded that 12\nU. S.

As a result, 12 CFR \u00a77.4000 falls\nwithin the heartland of Chevron. See United States v.\nMead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229\u2013230 (2001); see also, e.g.,\nSmiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.

S. 735,\n739 (1996) (deferring to OCC\u2019s interpretation of the term\n\u201c \u2018interest\u2019 \u201d in the NBA). \u201cIt is our practice to defer to the\nreasonable judgments of agencies with regard to the\nmeaning of ambiguous terms in statutes that they are\ncharged with administering,\u201d and \u201cthat practice extends to\nthe judgments of the Comptroller of the Currency with\nregard to the meaning of the banking laws.\u201d Ibid. The\nmajority does not disagree. See ante, at 3. As a result, the\nonly disputed question is whether the statutory term\n\u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is ambiguous and, if so, whether OCC\u2019s\nconstruction of it is reasonable.\n                              B\n   The majority concedes that there is \u201csome ambiguity as\nto the meaning of the statutory term \u2018visitorial powers.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. Yet it concludes that OCC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7484(a)\nis not entitled to deference because the Court \u201ccan discern\nthe outer limits of the term \u2018visitorial powers\u2019 even\nthrough the clouded lens of history\u201d and these outer defi\nnitional limits \u201cdo not include . . . ordinary enforcement of\nthe law.\u201d Ibid. I cannot agree. The statutory term \u201cvisi\ntorial powers\u201d is susceptible to more than one meaning,\nand the agency\u2019s construction is reasonable.\n   Because the NBA does not define \u201cvisitorial powers,\u201d the\n4         CUOMO v.

With respect to civil corporations, \u201cvisitation\u201d\nwas conducted \u201cby the government itself, through the\nmedium of the courts of justice.\u201d Id., at 634.

To support this argument, the majority briefly\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nalludes to the common-law history of visitation. See ante,\nat 3\u20134; see also United States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, 13\n(1994) (\u201c[A]bsent contrary indications, Congress intends to\nadopt the common law definition of statutory terms\u201d). In\nso doing, the majority fully accepts petitioner\u2019s argument\nthat \u201cCongress invoked a then-familiar common law term\nof corporate governance\u2014visitation\u2014to clarify that the\nStates, traditionally the supervisors of private corpora\ntions doing business within their jurisdictions, had no\nauthority to examine the condition of a national bank,\nrespond to any perceived financial risk, or hold the bank to\nits charter or the laws of its creation.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n21\u201322. Under the majority\u2019s view, any construction of\n\u00a7484(a) that fails to preserve the right of the States to\nenforce through judicial action their generally applicable\nlaws against national banks is unreasonable and, there\nfore, not entitled to deference. See ante, at 6\u20137.\n   But contrary to the majority\u2019s determination, the com\nmon-law tradition does not compel the conclusion that\npetitioner\u2019s definition of visitation is the only permissible\ninterpretation of the term. Indeed, a more thorough ex\namination of \u00a7484(a)\u2019s common-law ancestry suggests the\nopposite. As the majority notes, see ante, at 3\u20134, the\nconcept of visitation originated in Roman and canon law in\nwhich the term was used to describe the church hierar\nchy\u2019s authority over its own institutions, see Pound, Visi\ntatorial Jurisdiction Over Corporations in Equity, 49\nHarv. L. Rev. 369, 369\u2013370 (1936). The practice of visita\ntion later expanded to include the supervision of charities,\nuniversities, and civil corporations. Ibid.\n   With respect to churches, charities, and universities, a\nvisitor\u2019s duties were narrow. In the university setting, for\nexample, the \u201cpower of the visitor [was] confined to of\nfences against the private laws of the college; he ha[d] no\ncognizance of acts of disobedience to the general laws of\nthe land.\u201d 2 S. Kyd, Law of Corporations 276 (1794) (em\n6         CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nphasis in original). The visitor\u2019s duties were equally nar\nrow in the governance of ecclesiastical and charitable\ninstitutions. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 467\u2013472 (1765); Trustees of Dartmouth\nCollege v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 673\u2013677 (1819)\n(Story, J., concurring). If the sweep of a visitor\u2019s authority\nwith respect to civil corporations was the same, the major\nity would have a stronger argument that the \u201cvisitorial\npowers\u201d prohibition was similarly limited. See ante, at 3\u2013\n4. However, the common-law tradition instead suggests\nthat visitorial powers were broader with respect to civil\ncorporations, including banks.\n   Historically, visitorial authority over civil corporations\nwas exercised only by the sovereign who had broad au\nthority to assure compliance with generally applicable\nlaws. See Blackstone, supra, at 469 (\u201cThe king being thus\nconstituted by law the visitor of all civil corporations, the\nlaw has also appointed the place, wherein he shall exercise\nthis jurisdiction: which is the court of king\u2019s bench; where,\nand where only, all misbehaviors of this kind of corpora\ntions are enquired into and redressed, and all their con\ntroversies decided\u201d); 2 J.

See ante, at 5, n. 1. In\nWoodward, the Court addressed the scope of the visitor\u2019s authority over\na private college\u2014not a civil corporation.

Acts p. 303\n(authorizing banking commissioners to \u201cvisit\u201d a bank and\n\u201cexamine all [its] affairs\u201d to determine whether it had\n\u201ccomplied with the provisions of law applicable to [its]\ntransactions\u201d); Act of May 14, ch. 363, \u00a712, 1840 N.

Indeed,\nCongress modeled the NBA after New York\u2019s supervisory\nregime. See J. Knox, A History of Banking in the United\nStates 422 (1903) (reprint 1969).\n  Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, that this\nunderstanding of the common law confuses the sovereign\u2019s\n\u201cenforcement of general laws that apply equally to all\nactors within a State, like the ban on discrimination found\nin New York Executive Law \u00a7296\u2013a\u201d with \u201can exercise of\nvisitorial powers.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 24; see also ante, at\n7 (concluding that \u201ca sovereign\u2019s \u2018visitorial powers\u2019 and its\npower to enforce the law are two different things\u201d). But\nthis narrow conception of visitorial powers does not fully\ncapture the common law. In a section entitled \u201cVisitorial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhistorically did not have \u201claw enforcement power\u201d over churches,\nuniversities, and charitable organizations. See supra, at 5\u20136. But\nthere is strong evidence that visitors of civil corporations\u2014i.e., sover\neigns\u2014were so empowered. See supra, at 6\u20137. The distinction between\nthese species of visitation is crucial because it yields divergent under\nstandings as to the scope of the visitor\u2019s power to enforce generally\napplicable laws in court. Moreover, the majority\u2019s failure to confront\nthis important difference leaves a gap in its historical analysis that, in\nturn, undermines its conclusion that OCC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7484(a)\nwas unreasonable.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

In that case,\nthe state attorney general sought a writ of injunction to\n\u201crestrain the two defendant companies from exacting tolls\nfor the carriage of passengers or freight in excess of the\nmaximum rates established by\u201d Wisconsin law, 35 Wis., at\n432.

The court found\nthat the attorney general\u2019s visitorial power included en\nforcement of generally applicable law against civil corpo\nrations through courts of equity. See id., at 529\u2013530. As\nthe court explained, the common-law understanding of\nvisitorial powers had expanded beyond its ecclesiastical\nroots to include such authority. See id., at 530 (\u201cThe\ngrounds on which this jurisdiction rests are ancient; but\nthe extent of its application has grown rapidly of late\nyears, until a comparatively obscure and insignificant\njurisdiction has become one of great magnitude and public\nimport\u201d).\n10       CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  As a result, the majority\u2019s conclusion that when \u201ca state\nattorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a\nnational bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as\nsupervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law\nenforcer,\u201d ante, at 14, cannot be reconciled with this lead\ning case or the general common-law understanding on\nwhich the decision rests. At common law, all attempts by\nthe sovereign to compel civil corporations to comply with\nstate law\u2014whether through administrative subpoenas or\njudicial actions\u2014were visitorial in nature. Thus, even if\nthe sovereign\u2019s law enforcement and visitorial powers\nwere at one time distinct, by common law, they had\nmerged at least with respect to the enforcement of gener\nally applicable public laws against civil corporations. See\nThompson, supra, \u00a7460, at 556 (\u201cThe police power, in its\nvisitorial aspect, as exercised by congress and the several\nstates, extends to the minutest details of the banking\nbusiness\u201d (emphasis added)). By construing visitation so\nnarrowly, the majority implicitly rejects the efforts of\nWilliam Blackstone, James Kent, and Roscoe Pound, see\nsupra, at 6\u20137, in elucidating the historical meaning of this\nconcept. Like OCC, each of these venerable legal scholars\nunderstood visitation of civil corporations to include the\npower to enforce generally applicable laws through judicial\nactions. See ibid.\n  In the end, OCC was presented with a broad dictionary\ndefinition of \u201cvisitation\u201d and a common-law history sug\ngesting that the scope of the visitor\u2019s authority varied in\naccordance with the nature of the organization under\nsupervision. It is possible that the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d are\nnarrower than OCC concluded. But a visitor\u2019s powers\ncould also be broader. There is support for the proposition\nthat visitation includes enforcement of all generally appli\ncable laws. See supra, at 5\u201310. OCC instead interpreted\n\u201cvisitorial powers\u201d to prohibit only enforcement of laws\nconcerning \u201cactivities authorized or permitted pursuant to\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Reg. 1896).\n   Thus, although the text and history of visitation do not\nauthoritatively support either party\u2019s construction of the\nstatute, OCC\u2019s decision to adopt a more modest construc\ntion than could have been supported by the common-law\nand dictionary definition reinforces the reasonableness of\nits regulation. Put simply, OCC selected a permissible\nconstruction of a statutory term that was susceptible to\nmultiple interpretations.\n                              C\n   Petitioner nonetheless argues that the original structure\nof the NBA compels us to adopt his reading of \u201cvisitorial\npowers.\u201d When enacted in 1864, the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d\nclause was preceded by a statutory provision directing the\nComptroller of the Currency to appoint persons \u201cto make a\nthorough examination into all the affairs of [every bank\ning] association\u201d and to \u201cmake a full and detailed report of\nthe condition of the association to the comptroller.\u201d Act of\nJune 3, 1864, ch. 106, \u00a754, 13 Stat. 116. In addition, the\n\u201cvisitorial powers\u201d clause was succeeded by a sentence\nconcerning the compensation due to the examiners. See\nibid. Petitioner contends that the placement of the \u201cvisi\ntorial powers\u201d clause between these two provisions indi\ncates that it originally meant to ban States only from\nconducting the particular type of \u201cthorough examination\u201d\nof banking affairs described in the neighboring provisions.\nAnd, petitioner adds, \u00a7484 currently resides in the sub\nchapter of the statute entitled \u201cBank Examinations,\u201d\nwhich still includes a provision directing the Comptroller\nto appoint examiners \u201cto make a thorough examination of\n12        CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nall the affairs of the bank and . . . make a full and detailed\nreport of the condition of said bank to the Comptroller of\nthe Currency.\u201d 12 U. S. C. \u00a7481.\n   Petitioner\u2019s argument is undermined, however, by other\nstructural attributes of this subchapter. In \u00a7484(b), for\nexample, Congress provided that \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the\nstatute\u2019s visitorial-powers prohibition, \u201cState auditors and\nexaminers may . . . review [a national bank\u2019s] records\nsolely to ensure compliance with applicable State un\nclaimed property or escheat laws.\u201d Such review does not\nfall within petitioner\u2019s definition of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d\nbecause the enforcement of state property laws is in no\nway associated with national bank examinations or inter\nnal operations. Thus, were \u00a7484(a) to have the meaning\npetitioner assigns, there would have been no reason for\nCongress to identify the \u00a7484(b) authority as an exception\nto \u00a7484(a)\u2019s \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d prohibition, as the author\nity granted in \u00a7484(b) would never have been eliminated\nby \u00a7484(a).\n   Other exceptions in \u00a7484 also support OCC\u2019s construc\ntion of the statute. For example, \u00a7484(a) includes an\nexception for visitations \u201cauthorized by Federal law.\u201d One\ntype of visitation authorized by law is described in 26\nU. S. C. \u00a73305(c), which provides that \u201c[n]othing contained\nin [\u00a7484] shall prevent any State from requiring any na\ntional\u201d bank to provide payroll records and reports for\nunemployment tax purposes. Similarly, 12 U. S. C. \u00a762\npermits state tax officials to inspect national bank share\nholder lists. Both provisions would be unnecessary if\n\u201cvisitorial powers\u201d were limited to bank examinations and\ninternal operations.\n   In sum, the NBA\u2019s structure does not compel the con\nstruction of \u00a7484(a)\u2019s text that petitioner advocates.

But petitioner cannot prevail by simply\nshowing that this Court previously adopted a construction\nof \u00a7484 that differs from the interpretation later chosen by\nthe agency. \u201cA court\u2019s prior judicial construction of a\nstatute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled\nto Chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds\nthat its construction follows from the unambiguous terms\nof the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discre\ntion.\u201d Brand X, 545 U. S., at 982. These decisions do not\nconstrue \u00a7484 in a manner that trumps OCC\u2019s regulation.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, see ante, at 8\u20139, n. 3, peti\n\ntioner\u2019s structural argument is also undermined by the Riegle-Neal\nInterstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal),\n108 Stat. 2338, which authorized national banks to operate interstate\nbranches. The statute provides that \u201c[t]he laws of the host State\nregarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending,\nand establishment of intrastate branches shall apply to any branch in\nthe host State of an out-of-State national bank to the same extent as\nsuch State laws apply to a branch of a bank chartered by that State\u201d\nunless federal law separately pre-empts their application or the Comp\ntroller determines that application of the state law would have a\n\u201cdiscriminatory effect\u201d on the national bank branch. See id., at 2349\u2013\n2350, 12 U. S. C. \u00a736(f)(1)(A). Riegle-Neal further provides that \u201c[t]he\nprovisions of any State law to which a branch of a national bank is\nsubject under this paragraph shall be enforced, with respect to such\nbranch, by the Comptroller of the Currency.\u201d See id., at 2350, 12\nU. S. C. \u00a736(f)(1)(B). The United States has interpreted the \u201cshall be\nenforced\u201d language to provide OCC with exclusive enforcement author\nity. See Brief for Federal Respondent 46\u201348. This construction rein\nforces OCC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7484(a). If OCC has exclusive authority\nto enforce state law with respect to interstate branches of national\nbanks, it would be reasonable to interpret the statute to operate simi\nlarly with respect to the national banks themselves.\n14       CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   This Court\u2019s only decision directly addressing the mean\ning of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d is Guthrie, which held that the\nNBA did not prohibit a suit brought by a private share\nholder seeking to inspect the books of a national bank, 199\nU. S., at 157. In so holding, the Court contrasted \u201cthe\nprivate right of the shareholder to have an examination of\nthe business in which he is interested\u201d with a visitor\u2019s\n\u201cpublic right\u201d to examine \u201cthe conduct of the corporation\nwith a view to keeping it within its legal powers.\u201d Id., at\n158\u2013159. Guthrie thus draws a line between enforcement\nof private rights and the public act of visitation that is\nconsistent with the definition of visitation embraced by\nOCC. See id., at 158 (\u201cIn no case or authority that we\nhave been able to find has there been a definition of this\nright, which would include the private right of the share\nholder to have an examination of the business in which he\nis interested . . .\u201d). The agency has never taken the posi\ntion that the \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d prohibition extends to\nprivate action.\n   Nor does this Court\u2019s decision in First Nat. Bank in St.\nLouis v. Missouri, 263 U. S. 640 (1924) (St. Louis), fore\nclose OCC\u2019s construction of the statute. In that case, the\nState of Missouri brought a quo warranto proceeding in\nstate court \u201cto determine [the national bank\u2019s] authority to\nestablish and conduct a branch bank in the City of\nSt. Louis.\u201d Id., at 655. The Court first held that federal\nlaw did not authorize national banks to engage in branch\nbanking. See id., at 656\u2013659. \u201cHaving determined that\nthe power sought to be exercised by the bank finds no\njustification in any law or authority of the United States,\u201d\nthe Court then concluded that \u201cthe way is open for the\nenforcement of the state statute.\u201d Id., at 660.\n   Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, see ante,\nat 5\u20136, and n. 2, that St. Louis stands for the proposition\nthat a State retains the right to enforce any state law that\nis not substantively pre-empted with respect to national\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nbanks, see 263 U. S., at 660 (\u201cTo demonstrate the binding\nquality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement\ninvolves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of\nthe proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in\nthe very conception of law. . . . What the state is seeking to\ndo is to vindicate and enforce its own law . . .\u201d). Under this\nview, then, because the New York fair lending laws are\nnot substantively pre-empted, he is not exercising \u201cvisito\nrial powers\u201d by enforcing them.\n   Respondents counter that the holding of St. Louis is not\nso broad. In their view, the Court held only that a State\nmay enforce its laws against a national bank when federal\nlaw grants the bank no authority to engage in the underly\ning activity at issue. See Brief for Respondent Clearing\nHouse Association 33\u201334. Here, federal law expressly\nauthorizes national banks to make mortgage loans. See\n12 U. S. C. \u00a7371(a). Thus, unlike in St. Louis\u2014in which\nthe relevant state-law-proscribed conduct in a category\nthat was wholly beyond the powers granted to national\nbanks\u2014petitioner seeks to superintend the manner in\nwhich the national banks engage in activity expressly\nauthorized by federal law. According to respondents, then,\n\u00a7484(a)\u2019s ban on unauthorized visitation provides the\n\u201ccontrolling reason\u201d forbidding state enforcement that was\nabsent from St. Louis, see 263 U. S., at 660.\n   There is no need to decide which party has the better\nargument. The St. Louis decision nowhere references\n\u00a7484(a) or addresses \u201cvisitorial powers.\u201d Thus, as noted\nabove, even if the decision is best read to support peti\ntioner\u2019s view of the statute, that conclusion is insufficient\nto deny Chevron deference to OCC\u2019s construction of\n\u00a7484(a). \u201cSince Chevron teaches that a court\u2019s opinion as\nto the best reading of an ambiguous statute an agency is\ncharged with administering is not authoritative, the\nagency\u2019s decision to construe that statute differently from\na court does not say that the court\u2019s holding was legally\n16          CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nwrong. Instead, the agency may, consistent with the\ncourt\u2019s holding, choose a different construction, since the\nagency remains the authoritative interpreter (within the\nlimits of reason) of such statutes.\u201d Brand X, 545 U. S., at\n983. A judicial decision that fails to directly confront the\nprovision at issue cannot be deemed to have adopted the\n\u201cauthoritative\u201d construction of the statute.3 Petitioner\u2019s\nreliance on other decisions of this Court is misplaced for\nthis very same reason. See First Nat. Bank in Plant City\nv. Dickinson, 396 U. S. 122 (1969); Anderson Nat. Bank v.\nLuckett, 321 U. S. 233 (1944); First Nat. Bank of Bay City\nv. Fellows, 244 U. S. 416 (1917); Easton v.

None of these\ndecisions addressed the meaning of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d for\npurposes of \u00a7484(a), let alone provided a definitive con\nstruction of the statute.\n   Finally, this Court\u2019s decision in Watters v. Wachovia\nBank, N. A., 550 U. S. 1 (2007), supports OCC\u2019s construc\ntion of the statute. Watters addressed whether the NBA\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  majority\u2019s suggestion that the Court\u2019s decision in First Nat.\nBank in St. Louis v. Missouri, 263 U. S. 640 (1924), is not \u201cauthorita\ntive\u201d falls short of the mark. See ante, at 6, n. 2; see, e.g., ante, at 7\u20138\n(\u201c[R]eading \u2018visitorial powers\u2019 as limiting only sovereign oversight and\nsupervision would produce an entirely commonplace result\u2014the precise\nresult contemplated by our opinion in St. Louis\u201d).

But that conclusion rests on the assumption that the St. Louis\nCourt shared the majority\u2019s conception of law enforcement and visita\ntion as categorically distinct for purposes of \u00a7484(a). It is impossible to\nverify that assumption, however, because the bank never raised the\n\u201cvisitorial powers\u201d defense in that case. See Reply Brief for Petitioner\n6. If the Chevron doctrine is to have any interpretative value, an\nagency\u2019s construction of a statute cannot be foreclosed by a prior\njudicial decision in which the provision in question was neither raised\nby the parties nor passed upon by the court.\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

But\nthe Court was fully aware that the Michigan statutes\ngranted state banking commissioners the very enforce\nment authority that petitioner seeks to exert over the\nnational banks in this case. See id., at 9\u201310 (citing Mich.\nComp. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7445.1661 (West 2002), 493.56b (West\nSupp. 2005)); see also 550 U.

The Court\u2019s con\nclusion in Watters that \u00a7484(a) deprives the States of\ninspection and enforcement authority over the mortgage\nlending practices of national banks lends weight to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority contends that Watters is \u201cfully in accord with the well\n\nestablished distinction between supervision and law enforcement.\u201d\nAnte, at 6.

I disagree. None of\npetitioner\u2019s arguments provide a doctrinal basis for refus\ning to defer to the agency\u2019s reasonable construction of this\nstatute.\n   First, petitioner contends that OCC\u2019s regulation, which\ninterprets \u00a7484(a) to pre-empt state enforcement of state\nlaw but not the substantive state law itself, undermines\nimportant federalism principles and therefore triggers a\nrequirement that Congress clearly state its pre-emptive\nintentions, see Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460\n(1991) (\u201c[I]f Congress intends to alter the usual constitu\ntional balance between the States and the Federal Gov\nernment, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably\nclear in the language of the statute\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted; alteration in original)). Petitioner is incor\nrect because OCC\u2019s construction of the statute does not\nalter the balance of power established by the Constitution.\n   National banks are created by federal statute and there\nfore are subject to full congressional control. The States\n\u201ccan exercise no control over them, nor in any wise affect\ntheir operation, except in so far as Congress may see\nproper to permit.\u201d Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Nat.

Maryland, 4\nWheat. 316 (1819), this Court held federal law supreme\nover state law with respect to national banking\u201d). As a\nresult, the only question presented by this case is whether\nCongress has seen it \u201cproper to permit\u201d the States to\nenforce state fair lending laws against national banks.\nOCC\u2019s reasonable conclusion that \u00a7484(a) answers that\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

See id., at 22 (\u201cRegu\nlation of national bank operations is a prerogative of\nCongress under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper\nClauses. The Tenth Amendment, therefore, is not impli\ncated here\u201d (citation omitted)).\n   Second, petitioner argues that a clear statement is\nrequired because \u201cthe historic police powers of the States\n[are] not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that\nwas the clear and manifest purpose of Congress,\u201d Rice v.\nSanta Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). There\nshould be no presumption against pre-emption because\nCongress has expressly pre-empted state law in this case.\nSee Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9) (\u201c[T]he presump\ntion against pre-emption \u2018dissolves once there is conclusive\nevidence of intent to pre-empt in the express words of the\nstatute itself\u2019 \u201d (quoting Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,\n505 U. S. 504, 545 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\nment in part and dissenting in part)); see, e.g., Riegel v.\nMedtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2)\n(construing the express pre-emption provision of the\nMedical Device Amendments of 1976, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7360c\net seq., without any reliance on the presumption against\npre-emption).\n   In any event, this presumption is \u201cnot triggered when\nthe State regulates in an area where there has been a\nhistory of significant federal presence.\u201d United States v.\nLocke, 529 U. S. 89, 108 (2000). National banking is the\nparadigmatic example \u201cIn defining the pre-emptive scope\nof statutes and regulations granting a power to national\nbanks,\u201d this Court has taken the firm view that \u201cnormally\nCongress would not want States to forbid, or to impair\nsignificantly, the exercise of a power that Congress explic\nitly granted.\u201d Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v. Nel\n20        CUOMO v. CLEARING HOUSE ASSN., L. L. C.\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nson, 517 U. S. 25, 33 (1996). As a result, federal legisla\ntion concerning national banks is \u201cnot normally limited by,\nbut rather ordinarily pre-empt[s], contrary state law.\u201d Id.,\nat 32. As with general maritime law, Congress\u2019 \u201clegis\nlat[ion] in th[is] field from the earliest days of the Repub\nlic\u201d and its creation of an \u201cextensive federal statutory and\nregulatory scheme\u201d means that an \u201c \u2018assumption\u2019 of non\npre-emption is not triggered.\u201d Locke, supra, at 108. That\nthe States may also have legislated alongside Congress in\nthis area, see ante, at 12\u201313, does not alter this conclusion,\nsee, e.g., Franklin Nat. Bank of Franklin Square v. New\nYork, 347 U. S. 373 (1954).\n   Last, petitioner argues that Chevron deference is inap\nplicable because OCC\u2019s regulation declares the pre\nemptive scope of the NBA. And, the majority flatly asserts\nthat \u201c[i]f that is not pre-emption, nothing is.\u201d Ante, at 13.\nBut OCC did not declare the pre-emptive scope of the\nstatute; rather, it interpreted the term \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d\nto encompass state enforcement of state fair lending laws.\nThe pre-emption of state enforcement authority to which\npetitioner objects thus follows from the statute itself\u2014not\nagency action. See Smiley, 517 U. S., at 744 (\u201cThis argu\nment confuses the question of the substantive (as opposed\nto pre-emptive) meaning of a statute with the question of\nwhether a statute is pre-emptive. We may assume (with\nout deciding) that the latter question must always be\ndecided de novo by the courts. That is not the question at\nissue here; there is no doubt that \u00a785 pre-empts state law\u201d\n(emphasis in original)).\n   Here, Congress\u2014not the agency\u2014has decided that \u201c[n]o\nnational bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers\nexcept as authorized by Federal law.\u201d 12 U. S. C. \u00a7484(a).\nIndeed, the majority agrees that it is the \u201cstatutory\nterm\u201d\u2014and not OCC\u2019s regulation\u2014that \u201cdefine[s] and\nthereby limit[s] the category of action reserved to the\nFederal Government and forbidden to the States.\u201d Ante,\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          21\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nat 13. As a result, OCC has simply interpreted that term\nto encompass petitioner\u2019s decision to demand national\nbank records and threaten judicial enforcement of New\nYork fair lending laws as a means of obtaining them. As\nSmiley showed, a federal agency\u2019s construction of an am\nbiguous statutory term may clarify the pre-emptive scope\nof enacted federal law, but that fact alone does not mean\nthat it is the agency, rather than Congress, that has ef\nfected the pre-emption.\n  Petitioner\u2019s federalism-based objections to Chevron\ndeference ultimately turn on a single proposition: It is\ndoubtful that Congress pre-empted state enforcement of\nstate laws but not the underlying state laws themselves.\nBut it is not this Court\u2019s task to decide whether the statu\ntory scheme established by Congress is unusual or even\n\u201c[b]izarre.\u201d See ante, at 7. The Court must decide only\nwhether the construction adopted by the agency is unam\nbiguously foreclosed by the statute\u2019s text. Here, the text,\nstructure, and history of \u201cvisitorial powers\u201d support the\nagency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of \u00a7484. Petitioner has\nnot identified any constitutional principle that would\nrequire Congress to take the greater step of pre-empting\nall enforcement of state lending laws (including private\nenforcement) even though its central concern was the\nallocation of the right to exercise public visitation over\nnational bank activities.\n                        *    *     *\n  For all these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals.\n",

We granted certiorari. 555 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 987, 173 L.Ed.2d 171 (2009). The question presented is whether <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2715</span> the Comptroller's regulation purporting to pre-empt state law enforcement can be upheld as a reasonable interpretation of the National Bank Act.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Section 484(a) of Title 12, U.S.C., a provision of the National Bank Act, 13 Stat. 99, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"No national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in the courts of justice or such as shall be, or have been exercised or directed by Congress or by either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either House duly authorized.\"</blockquote>\n<p>The Comptroller, charged with administering the National Bank Act, adopted, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the regulation at issue here designed to implement the statutory provision. Its principal provisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"\u00a7 7.4000 Visitorial powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(a) <i>General rule.</i> (1) Only the OCC or an authorized representative of the OCC may exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. State officials may not exercise visitorial powers with respect to national banks, such as conducting examinations, inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks, or prosecuting enforcement actions, except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law. However, production of a bank's records (other than non-public OCC information under 12 CFR part 4, subpart C) may be required under normal judicial procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(2) For purposes of this section, visitorial powers include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) Examination of a bank;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) Inspection of a bank's books and records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(iii) Regulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(iv) Enforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000 (2009).</blockquote>\n<p>By its clear text, this regulation prohibits the States from \"prosecuting enforcement actions\" except in \"limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\"</p>\n<p>Under the familiar <i>Chevron</i> framework, we defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering. <i>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-counci/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). There is necessarily some ambiguity as to the meaning of the statutory term \"visitorial powers,\" especially since we are working in an era when the prerogative writs\u0097through which visitorial powers were traditionally enforced\u0097 are not in vogue. The Comptroller can give authoritative meaning to the statute within the bounds of that uncertainty. But the presence of some uncertainty does not expand <i>Chevron</i> deference to cover virtually any interpretation of the National Bank Act. We can discern the outer limits of the term \"visitorial powers\" even through the clouded lens of history. They do not include, as the Comptroller's expansive regulation would provide, ordinary enforcement of the law. Evidence from the time of the statute's enactment, a long line of our own cases, and application of normal principles of construction to the National Bank Act make that clear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Historically, the sovereign's right of visitation over corporations paralleled the right of the church to supervise its institutions and the right of the founder of a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2716</span> charitable institution \"to see that [his] property [was] rightly employed,\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 469 (1765). By extension of this principle, \"[t]he king [was] by law the visitor of all civil corporations,\" <i>ibid.</i> A visitor could inspect and control the visited institution at will.</p>\n<p>When the National Bank Act was enacted in 1864, \"visitation\" was accordingly understood as \"[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation\" by \"the government itself.\" 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 790 (15th ed. 1883). Lower courts understood \"visitation\" to mean \"the act of a superior or superintending officer, who visits a corporation to examine into its manner of conducting business, and enforce an observance of its laws and regulations.\" <i>First Nat. Bank of Youngstown v. Hughes,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></span>, 740 (C.C.N.D.Ohio 1881). A State was the \"visitor\" of all companies incorporated in the State, simply by virtue of the State's role as sovereign: The \"legislature is the visitor of all corporations founded by it.\" <i>Guthrie v. Harkness,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96331\"><a href=\"/opinion/96331/guthrie-v-harkness/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 157, 26 S.Ct. 4, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>This relationship between sovereign and corporation was understood to allow the States to use prerogative writs\u0097such as mandamus and <i>quo warranto</i>\u0097to exercise control \"whenever a corporation [wa]s abusing the power given it, or, . . . or acting adversely to the public, or creating a nuisance.\" H. Wilgus, Private Corporations, in 8 American Law and Procedure \u00a7 157, pp. 224-225 (1910). State visitorial commissions were authorized to \"exercise a general supervision\" over companies in the State. I. Wormser, Private Corporations \u00a7 80, pp. 100, 101, in 4 Modern American Law (1921).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Our cases have always understood \"visitation\" as this right to oversee corporate affairs, quite separate from the power to enforce the law. In the famous <i>Dartmouth College</i> case, Justice Story, describing visitation of a charitable corporation, wrote that Dartmouth was \"subject to the controlling authority of its legal visitor, who . . . may amend and repeal its statutes, remove its officers, correct abuses, and generally superintend the management of [its] trusts,\" and who are \"liable to no supervision or control.\" <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v.

This power of \"genera[l] superintend[ence]\" stood in contrast to action by the court of chancery, which acted \"not as itself possessing a visitorial power. . . but as possessing a general jurisdiction. . . to redress grievances, and frauds.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 676.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Guthrie, supra,</i> we held that a shareholder acting in his role as a private individual was not exercising a \"visitorial power\" under the National Bank Act when he petitioned a court to force the production of corporate records, <i>id.,</i> at 159, 26 S.Ct. 4. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2717</span> \"[C]ontrol in the courts of justice,\" we said, is not visitorial, and we drew a contrast between the nonvisitorial act of \"su[ing] in the courts of the State\" and the visitorial \"supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency,\" <i>id.,</i> at 159, 157, 26 S.Ct. 4.</p>\n<p>In <i>First Nat.

We said that only the United States may perform visitorial administrative oversight, such as \"inquir[ing] by <i>quo warranto</i> whether a national bank is acting in excess of its charter powers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213. But if a state statute of general applicability is not substantively pre-empted, then \"the power of enforcement must rest with the [State] and not with\" the National Government, <i>ibid.</i><sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Our most recent decision, <i>Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145747\"><a href=\"/opinion/145747/watters-v-wachovia-bank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 1559, 167 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007), does not, as the dissent contends, <i>post,</i> at 2731, \"suppor[t] OCC's construction of the statute.\" To the contrary, it is fully in accord with the well established distinction between supervision and law enforcement. <i>Watters</i> held that a State may not exercise \"`general supervision and control'\" over a subsidiary of a national bank, 550 U.S., at 8, 127 S.Ct. 1559, because \"multiple audits and surveillance under rival oversight regimes\" would cause uncertainty, <i>id.,</i> at 21, 127 S.Ct. 1559. \"[G]eneral supervision and control\" and \"oversight\" are worlds apart from law enforcement. All parties to the case agreed that Michigan's general oversight regime could not be imposed on national banks; the sole question was whether operating subsidiaries of national banks enjoyed the same immunity from state visitation. The opinion addresses and answers no other question.</p>\n<p>The foregoing cases all involve enforcement of state law. But if the Comptroller's exclusive exercise of visitorial powers precluded law enforcement by the States, it would also preclude law enforcement by federal agencies. Of course it does not. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Sav. Assn. v. Douglas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1543556\"><a href=\"/opinion/1543556/bank-of-america-nat-trust-sav-assn-v-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 105-106 (CADC 1939) (Securities Exchange Commission investigation of bank fraud is not an exercise of \"visitorial powers\"); <i>Peoples Bank of Danville v. Williams,</i> 449 F.Supp. 254, 260 (W.D.Va.1978) (same).</p>\n<p>In sum, the unmistakable and utterly consistent teaching of our jurisprudence, both before and after enactment of the National Bank Act, is that a sovereign's \"visitorial powers\" and its power to enforce the law are two different things. There is not a credible argument to the contrary. And contrary to what the Comptroller's regulation says, the National Bank Act pre-empts only the former.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The consequences of the regulation also cast doubt upon its validity. No one denies <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2718</span> that the National Bank Act leaves in place some state substantive laws affecting banks. See Brief for Federal Respondent 20; Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association, L.L.C. 29; <i>post,</i> at 2730-2731. But the Comptroller's rule says that the State may not <i>enforce</i> its valid, non-pre-empted laws against national banks. <i>Ibid.</i> The bark remains, but the bite does not.</p>\n<p>The dissent admits, with considerable understatement, that such a result is \"unusual,\" <i>ibid.</i> \"Bizarre\" would be more apt. As the Court said in <i>St. Louis:</i></p>\n<blockquote>\"To demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law.\" 263 U.S., at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213.</blockquote>\n<p>In sharp contrast to the \"unusual\" reading propounded by the Comptroller's regulation, reading \"visitorial powers\" as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result\u0097the precise result contemplated by our opinion in <i>St. Louis,</i> which said that if a state statute is valid as to national banks, \"the corollary that it is obligatory <i>and enforceable</i> necessarily results.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 659-660, 44 S.Ct. 213 (emphasis added). Channeling state attorneys general into judicial law-enforcement proceedings (rather than allowing them to exercise \"visitorial\" oversight) would preserve a regime of exclusive administrative oversight by the Comptroller while honoring in fact rather than merely in theory Congress's decision not to pre-empt substantive state law. This system echoes many other mixed state/federal regimes in which the Federal Government exercises general oversight while leaving state substantive law in place. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Wyeth v. Levine,</i> 555 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009).</p>\n<p>This reading is also suggested by \u00a7 484(a)'s otherwise inexplicable reservation of state powers \"vested in the courts of justice.\" As described earlier, visitation was normally conducted through use of the prerogative writs of mandamus and <i>quo warranto.</i> The exception could not possibly exempt that manner of exercising visitation, or else the exception would swallow the rule. Its only conceivable purpose is to preserve normal civil and criminal lawsuits. To be sure, the reservation of powers \"vested in the courts of justice\" is phrased as an exception from the prohibition of visitorial powers. But as we have just discussed, it cannot possibly be that, and it is explicable only as an attempt to make clear that the courts' ordinary powers of enforcing the law are not affected.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>On a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and law enforcement is clear. If a State chooses to pursue enforcement of its laws in court, then it is not exercising its power of visitation and will be treated like a litigant. An attorney general acting as a civil litigant must file a lawsuit, survive a motion to dismiss, endure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2719</span> the rules of procedure and discovery, and risk sanctions if his claim is frivolous or his discovery tactics abusive. Judges are trusted to prevent \"fishing expeditions\" or an undirected rummaging through bank books and records for evidence of some unknown wrongdoing. In New York, civil discovery is far more limited than the full range of \"visitorial powers\" that may be exercised by a sovereign. Courts may enter protective orders to prevent \"unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice,\" N.Y. Civ. Prac. Law Ann. \u00a7 3103(a) (West 2005), and may supervise discovery <i>sua sponte,</i> \u00a7 3104(a). A visitor, by contrast, may inspect books and records at any time for any or no reason.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Comptroller's regulation, therefore, does not comport with the statute. Neither does the Comptroller's <i>interpretation</i> of its regulation, which differs from the text and must be discussed separately.</p>\n<p>Evidently realizing that exclusion of state enforcement of <i>all</i> state laws against national banks is too extreme to be contemplated, the Comptroller sought to limit the sweep of its regulation by the following passage set forth in the agency's statement of basis and purpose in the Federal Register:</p>\n<blockquote>\"What the case law <i>does</i> recognize is that `states retain some power to regulate national banks in areas such as contracts, debt collection, acquisition and transfer of property, and taxation, zoning, criminal, and tort law.' [citing a Ninth Circuit case.] Application of these laws to national banks and their implementation by state authorities typically does not affect the content or extent of the Federally-authorized business of banking . . . but rather establishes the legal infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability of national banks . . . to do business.\" 69 Fed.Reg. 1896 (2004) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>This cannot be reconciled with the regulation's almost categorical prohibition in 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a)(1) of \"prosecuting enforcement actions.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Nor can it be justified by the provision in subsection (a)(2)(iv) which defines visitorial powers to include \"[e]nforcing compliance with any applicable. . . state laws concerning\" \"activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law,\" \u00a7 7.4000(a)(2)(iii). The latter phrase cannot be interpreted to include only distinctively banking activities (leaving the States free to enforce nonbanking state laws), because if it were so interpreted subsection (a)(2)(iii), which uses the same terminology, would limit the Comptroller's exclusive visitorial power of \"regulation and supervision\" to distinctively banking activities\u0097which no one thinks is the case. Anyway, the National Bank Act <i>does</i> specifically authorize and permit activities that fall within what the statement of basis and purpose calls \"the legal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2720</span> infrastructure that surrounds and supports the ability of national banks . . . to do business.\" See, <i>e.g.,</i> 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 Third (power to make contracts); \u00a7 24 Seventh (\"all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking\"). And of course a distinction between \"implementation\" of \"infrastructure\" and judicial enforcement of other laws can be found nowhere within the text of the statute. This passage in the statement of basis and purpose, resting upon neither the text of the regulation nor the text of the statute, attempts to do what Congress declined to do: exempt national banks from all state banking laws, or at least state enforcement of those laws.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The dissent fails to persuade us. Its fundamental contention\u0097that the exclusive grant of visitorial powers can be interpreted to preclude state enforcement of state laws\u0097rests upon a logical fallacy. The dissent establishes, <i>post,</i> at 2726, (and we do not at all contest), that in the course of exercising visitation powers the sovereign can compel compliance with the law. But it concludes from that, <i>post,</i> at 2727, that <i>any</i> sovereign attempt to compel compliance with the law can be deemed an exercise of the visitation power. That conclusion obviously does not follow. For example, in the course of exercising its visitation powers, the sovereign can assuredly compel a bank to honor obligations that are in default. Does that mean that the sovereign's taking the same action in executing a civil judgment for payment of those obligations can be considered an exercise of the visitation power? Of course not. Many things can be compelled through the visitation power that can be compelled through the exercise of other sovereign power as well. The critical question is not what is being compelled, but what sovereign power has been invoked to compel it. And the power to enforce the law exists separate and apart from the power of visitation.</p>\n<p>The dissent argues that the Comptroller's expansive reading of \"visitorial powers\" does not intrude upon the, \"`the historic police powers of the States,'\" <i>post,</i> at 2732, (quoting <i>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104425\"><a href=\"/opinion/104425/rice-v-santa-fe-elevator-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947)), because, like federal maritime law, federal involvement in this field dates to \"`the earliest days of the Republic,'\" <i>post,</i> at 2733 (quoting <i>United States v. Locke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118346\"><a href=\"/opinion/118346/united-states-v-locke/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 108, 120 S.Ct. 1135, 146 L.Ed.2d 69 (2000)). For that reason, the dissent concludes, this case does not raise the sort of federalism concerns that prompt a presumption against pre-emption. We have not invoked the presumption against pre-emption, and think it unnecessary to do so in giving force to the plain terms of the National Bank Act. Neither, however, should the incursion that the Comptroller's regulation makes upon traditional state powers be minimized. Although the sovereign visitorial power of assuring national-bank compliance with <i>all</i> laws inhered in the Federal Government from the time of its creation of national banks, the Comptroller was not given authority to enforce nonpre-empted state laws until 1966. See Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966, Tit. III, 80 Stat. 1046-1055. A power first exercised during the lifetime of every current Justice is hardly involvement \"from the earliest days of the Republic.\"</p>\n<p>States, on the other hand, have always enforced their general laws against national banks\u0097and have enforced their banking-related laws against national banks for at least 85 years, as evidenced by <i>St. Louis,</i> in which we upheld enforcement of a state anti-bank-branching law, 263 U.S., at 656, 44 S.Ct. 213.

That is much too kind. It is not without reason that the regulation is contained within a subpart of the Comptroller's regulations on Bank Activities and Operations that is entitled \"Preemption.\" The purpose and function of the statutory term \"visitorial powers\" is to define and thereby limit the category of action reserved to the Federal Government and forbidden to the States. Any interpretation of \"visitorial powers\" necessarily \"declares the preemptive scope of the NBA,\" <i>ibid.</i> What is clear from logic is also clear in application: The regulation declares that \"[s]tate officials may not . . . prosecut[e] enforcement actions.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a). If that is not pre-emption, nothing is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>Applying the foregoing principles to this case is not difficult. \"Visitorial powers\" in the National Bank Act refers to a sovereign's supervisory powers over corporations. They include any form of administrative oversight that allows a sovereign to inspect books and records on demand, even if the process is mediated by a court through prerogative writs or similar means. The Comptroller reasonably interpreted this statutory term to include \"conducting examinations [and] inspecting or requiring the production of books or records of national banks,\" \u00a7 7.4000, when the State conducts those activities in its capacity as supervisor of corporations.</p>\n<p>When, however, a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer. Such a lawsuit is not an exercise of \"visitorial powers\" and thus the Comptroller erred by extending the definition of \"visitorial powers\" to include \"prosecuting enforcement actions\" in state courts, \u00a7 7.4000.</p>\n<p>The request for information in the present case was stated to be \"in lieu of\" other action; implicit was the threat that if the request was not voluntarily honored, that other action would be taken. All parties have assumed, and we agree, that if the threatened action would have been unlawful the request-cum-threat could be enjoined. Here the threatened action was not the bringing of a civil suit, or the obtaining of a judicial search warrant based on probable cause, but rather the Attorney General's issuance of subpoena on his own authority under New York <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2722</span> Executive Law, which permits such subpoenas in connection with his investigation of \"repeated fraudulent or illegal acts . . . in the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business.\" See N.Y. Exec. Law Ann. \u00a7 63(12) (West 2002). That is not the exercise of the power of law enforcement \"vested in the courts of justice\" which 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a) exempts from the ban on exercise of supervisory power.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the injunction below is affirmed as applied to the threatened issuance of executive subpoenas by the Attorney General for the State of New York, but vacated insofar as it prohibits the Attorney General from bringing judicial enforcement actions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice THOMAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice ALITO join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The Court holds that the term \"visitorial powers\" as used in the National Bank Act (NBA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a), refers only \"to a sovereign's supervisory powers over corporations,\" which are limited to \"administrative oversight\" including \"inspect[ion of] books and records on demand.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2721. Based on this definition, the Court concludes that \u00a7 484(a) does not pre-empt a \"state attorney general['s] . . . suit to enforce state law against a national bank.\" <i>Ibid.</i> I would affirm the Court of Appeals' determinations that the term \"visitorial powers\" is ambiguous and that it was reasonable for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to interpret the term to encompass state efforts to obtain national bank records and to enforce state fair lending laws against national banks. Accordingly, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The NBA provides that \"[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law, vested in the courts of justice or such as shall be, or have been exercised or directed by Congress or by either House thereof or by any committee of Congress or of either House duly authorized.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a). Through notice-and-comment rulemaking, OCC issued a regulation defining \"visitorial powers\" as including: \"(i) Examination of a bank; (ii) Inspection of a bank's books and records; (iii) Regulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law; and (iv) Enforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(a)(2) (2005). OCC further concluded that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a)'s \"vested in the courts of justice\" exception pertains only to the \"powers inherent in the judiciary and does not grant state or other governmental authorities any right to inspect, superintend, direct, regulate or compel compliance by a national bank with respect to any law, regarding the content or conduct of activities authorized for national banks under Federal law.\" 12 CFR \u00a7 7.4000(b)(2). The Court of Appeals upheld OCC's regulation as reasonable.

See <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716. As a result, the only disputed question is whether the statutory term \"visitorial powers\" is ambiguous and, if so, whether OCC's construction of it is reasonable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority concedes that there is \"some ambiguity as to the meaning of the statutory term `visitorial powers.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> Yet it concludes that OCC's interpretation of \u00a7 484(a) is not entitled to deference because the Court \"can discern the outer limits of the term `visitorial powers' even through the clouded lens of history\" and these outer definitional limits \"do not include. . . ordinary enforcement of the law.\" <i>Ibid.</i> I cannot agree. The statutory term \"visitorial powers\" is susceptible to more than one meaning, and the agency's construction is reasonable.</p>\n<p>Because the NBA does not define \"visitorial powers,\" the ordinary meaning of the words chosen by Congress provides the starting point for interpreting the statute. See <i>Dean v. United States,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 1853, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009) (\"We start, as always, with the language of the statute\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Asgrow Seed Co. v.

In 1864, when the NBA was enacted, \"visitation\" was generally defined as \"[i]nspection; superintendence; direction; [and] regulation.\" 2 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 598 (1860); see also 2 J. Bouvier, A Law Dictionary 633 (1852) (defining \"visitation\" as \"[t]he act of examining into the affairs of a corporation\"). With respect to civil corporations, \"visitation\" was conducted \"by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 634. The Court has previously looked to these definitions in examining the meaning of \"visitorial powers\" for purposes of the NBA. See <i>Guthrie v. Harkness,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96331\"><a href=\"/opinion/96331/guthrie-v-harkness/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 158, 26 S.Ct. 4, 50 L.Ed. 130 (1905).</p>\n<p>OCC's interpretation of \"visitorial powers\" to include both \"[r]egulation and supervision of activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law\" and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2724</span> \"[e]nforcing compliance with any applicable federal or state laws concerning those activities,\" 12 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 7.4000(a)(2)(iii), (vi), fits comfortably within this broad dictionary definition of \"visitation.\" And, in turn, petitioner's demand for nonpublic information to force national banks to comply with state fair lending laws under threat of judicial action would appear to qualify as an attempt to \"superinten[d]\" the banks' federally authorized operations \"through the medium of the courts of justice.\" See Burrill, <i>supra,</i> at 598; Bouvier, <i>supra,</i> at 634.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as the majority concludes, \"visitorial powers\" could be limited to conducting examinations of national banks or otherwise interfering with their internal operations. To support this argument, the majority briefly alludes to the common-law history of visitation. See <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716; see also <i>United States v. Shabani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117878\"><a href=\"/opinion/117878/united-states-v-shabani/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994) (\"[A]bsent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms\"). In so doing, the majority fully accepts petitioner's argument that \"Congress invoked a then-familiar common law term of corporate governance\u0097visitation\u0097to clarify that the States, traditionally the supervisors of private corporations doing business within their jurisdictions, had no authority to examine the condition of a national bank, respond to any perceived financial risk, or hold the bank to its charter or the laws of its creation.\" Brief for Petitioner 21-22. Under the majority's view, any construction of \u00a7 484(a) that fails to preserve the right of the States to enforce through judicial action their generally applicable laws against national banks is unreasonable and, therefore, not entitled to deference. See <i>ante,</i> at 2717.</p>\n<p>But contrary to the majority's determination, the common-law tradition does not compel the conclusion that petitioner's definition of visitation is the only permissible interpretation of the term. Indeed, a more thorough examination of \u00a7 484(a)'s common-law ancestry suggests the opposite. As the majority notes, see <i>ante,</i> at 2715-2716, the concept of visitation originated in Roman and canon law in which the term was used to describe the church hierarchy's authority over its own institutions, see Pound, Visitatorial Jurisdiction Over Corporations in Equity, 49 Harv. L.Rev. 369, 369-370 (1936). The practice of visitation later expanded to include the supervision of charities, universities, and civil corporations. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>With respect to churches, charities, and universities, a visitor's duties were narrow. In the university setting, for example, the \"power of the visitor [was] confined to offences against the <i>private</i> laws of the college; he ha[d] no cognizance of acts of disobedience to the general laws of the land.\" 2 S. Kyd, Law of Corporations 276 (1794) (emphasis in original). The visitor's duties were equally narrow in the governance of ecclesiastical and charitable institutions. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 467-472 (1765); <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85282\"><a href=\"/opinion/85282/dartmouth-college-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 673-677, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819) (Story, J., concurring). If the sweep of a visitor's authority with respect to civil corporations was the same, the majority would have a stronger argument that the \"visitorial powers\" prohibition was similarly limited. See <i>ante,</i> at 2717. However, the common-law tradition instead suggests that visitorial powers were broader with respect to civil corporations, including banks.</p>\n<p>Historically, visitorial authority over civil corporations was exercised only by the sovereign who had broad authority to assure <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2725</span> compliance with generally applicable laws. See Blackstone, <i>supra,</i> at 469 (\"The king being thus constituted by law the visitor of all civil corporations, the law has also appointed the place, wherein he shall exercise this jurisdiction: which is the court of king's bench; where, and where only, all misbehaviors of this kind of corporations are enquired into and redressed, and all their controversies decided\"); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 241 (1827) (explaining that \"visitation of civil corporations is by the government itself, through the medium of the courts of justice\"). \"Civil corporations, whether public, as the corporations of towns and cities; or private, as bank, insurance, manufacturing, and other companies of the like nature, are not subject to [private] visitation. They are subject to the general law of the land, and amenable to the judicial tribunals for the exercise and the abuse of their powers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 244; see also J. Angell &amp; S. Ames, Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 684, p. 680 (4th ed. 1852) (\"Civil corporations, whether public or private, being created for public use and advantage, properly fall under the superintendency of that sovereign power whose duty it is to take care of the public interest; whereas, corporations, whose object is the distribution of a private benefaction, may well find jealous guardians in the zeal or vanity of the founder, his heirs, or appointees\").</p>\n<p>States have traditionally exercised their visitorial powers over civil corporations by invoking the authority of the judiciary to \"compel domestic corporations or their officers to perform specific duties incumbent on them by reason of their charters, <i>or under statutes or ordinances or imposed by the common law.</i>\" Pound, <i>supra,</i> at 375 (emphasis added); see also S. Merrill, Law of Mandamus \u00a7 158, p. 194 (1892) (explaining that \"under the visitorial power of the state, any breach of duty by a private corporation may be corrected by\" the writ of mandamus and that the duty \"may be imposed by [the corporation's] charter, by the general statutes, or by the common law\" (footnotes omitted)). As Merrill explained, such actions were employed to compel common carriers and certain other civil corporations to adhere to \"statutory or common law\" duties, including the duty to \"exten[d] to all without discrimination the use of their services.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00a7 162, at 200; see also J. Grant, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Corporations in General, As Well Aggregate as Sole 262 (1854) (explaining that mandamus was available when corporations \"refuse[d] to perform a duty cast upon them by the law of the land\").<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2726</span> Even before enactment of the NBA, several States enacted laws granting banking commissioners specific authority to investigate compliance with generally applicable laws and to use the courts to ensure observance therewith. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Act of Feb. 23, ch. 14, \u00a7 2, 1838 Mass. Acts p. 303 (authorizing banking commissioners to \"visit\" a bank and \"examine all [its] affairs\" to determine whether it had \"complied with the provisions of law applicable to [its] transactions\"); Act of May 14, ch. 363, \u00a7 12, 1840 N.Y. Laws pp. 307-308 (authorizing banking commissioners to bring judicial actions against banks \"found to have violated any law of this state . . . in the same manner and with the like effect as any incorporated bank may be proceeded against for a violation of its charter\"). Indeed, Congress modeled the NBA after New York's supervisory regime. See J. Knox, A History of Banking in the United States 422 (1903) (reprint 1969).</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, that this understanding of the common law confuses the sovereign's \"enforcement of general laws that apply equally to all actors within a State, like the ban on discrimination found in New York Executive Law \u00a7 296-a\" with \"an exercise of visitorial powers.\" Brief for Petitioner 24; see also <i>ante,</i> at 2717 (concluding that \"a sovereign's `visitorial powers' and its power to enforce the law are two different things\"). But this narrow conception of visitorial powers does not fully capture the common law. In a section entitled \"Visitorial power,\" one treatise explained that \"[a]s a general rule the state has the same control, in this respect, over corporations that it has over individuals.\" C. Elliott, Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 90, p. 80 (rev.3d ed.1900); see also 1 S. Thompson, Commentaries on the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 475, p. 580 (2d ed.1908) (\"In its visitorial capacity the state checks and controls corporate affairs, even for the protection of those who deal with them\"). If the sovereign's power of visitation was limited to oversight of \"corporate affairs,\" visitation would not parallel the sovereign's control over individuals or allow the sovereign to protect through judicial action the rights of individuals who \"deal with\" the corporation. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision in <i>Attorney General v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wis.</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span> (1874) \u0097 which has been referred to as \"the leading American case for the visitorial jurisdiction of equity,\" Pound, 49 Harv. L.Rev., at 380\u0097 illustrates the point. In that case, the state attorney general sought a writ of injunction to \"restrain the two defendant companies from exacting tolls for the carriage of passengers or freight in excess of the maximum rates established by\" Wisconsin law, 35 Wis., at 432. The attorney general \"appl[ied] for the writ on behalf of the public,\" <i>id.,</i> at 531, in order \"`to correct abuses and save the rights of the people,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 572. The court found that the attorney general's visitorial power included enforcement of generally applicable law against civil corporations through courts of equity. See <i>id.,</i> at 529-530. As the court explained, the common-law understanding of visitorial powers had expanded beyond its ecclesiastical roots to include such authority. See <i>id.,</i> at 530 (\"The grounds on which this jurisdiction rests are ancient; but the extent of its application has grown rapidly of late years, until a comparatively obscure and insignificant jurisdiction has become one of great magnitude and public import\").</p>\n<p>As a result, the majority's conclusion that when \"a state attorney general brings suit to enforce state law against a national <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2727</span> bank, he is not acting in the role of sovereign-as-supervisor, but rather in the role of sovereign-as-law-enforcer,\" <i>ante,</i> at 2721, cannot be reconciled with this leading case or the general common-law understanding on which the decision rests. At common law, all attempts by the sovereign to compel civil corporations to comply with state law\u0097whether through administrative subpoenas or judicial actions\u0097were visitorial in nature. Thus, even if the sovereign's law enforcement and visitorial powers were at one time distinct, by common law, they had merged at least with respect to the enforcement of generally applicable public laws against civil corporations. See Thompson, <i>supra,</i> \u00a7 460, at 556 (\"The police power, <i>in its visitorial aspect,</i> as exercised by congress and the several states, extends to the minutest details of the banking business\" (emphasis added)). By construing visitation so narrowly, the majority implicitly rejects the efforts of William Blackstone, James Kent, and Roscoe Pound, see <i>supra,</i> at 2717, in elucidating the historical meaning of this concept. Like OCC, each of these venerable legal scholars understood visitation of civil corporations to include the power to enforce generally applicable laws through judicial actions. See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>In the end, OCC was presented with a broad dictionary definition of \"visitation\" and a common-law history suggesting that the scope of the visitor's authority varied in accordance with the nature of the organization under supervision. It is possible that the \"visitorial powers\" are narrower than OCC concluded. But a visitor's powers could also be broader. There is support for the proposition that visitation includes enforcement of all generally applicable laws. See <i>supra,</i> at 2716-2719. OCC instead interpreted \"visitorial powers\" to prohibit only enforcement of laws concerning \"activities authorized or permitted pursuant to federal banking law.\" 12 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 7.4000(a)(2)(iii) and (iv). States are thus free to enforce applicable laws that do not regulate federally authorized banking activities, see \u00a7 7.4000(a)(3), \"including, for example, criminal, tax, zoning, and labor and employment laws,\" Brief for Federal Respondent 15 (citing 69 Fed. Reg. 1896).</p>\n<p>Thus, although the text and history of visitation do not authoritatively support either party's construction of the statute, OCC's decision to adopt a more modest construction than could have been supported by the common-law and dictionary definition reinforces the reasonableness of its regulation. Put simply, OCC selected a permissible construction of a statutory term that was susceptible to multiple interpretations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Petitioner nonetheless argues that the original structure of the NBA compels us to adopt his reading of \"visitorial powers.\" When enacted in 1864, the \"visitorial powers\" clause was preceded by a statutory provision directing the Comptroller of the Currency to appoint persons \"to make a thorough examination into all the affairs of [every banking] association\" and to \"make a full and detailed report of the condition of the association to the comptroller.\" Act of June 3, 1864, ch. 106, \u00a7 54, 13 Stat. 116. In addition, the \"visitorial powers\" clause was succeeded by a sentence concerning the compensation due to the examiners. See <i>ibid.</i> Petitioner contends that the placement of the \"visitorial powers\" clause between these two provisions indicates that it originally meant to ban States only from conducting the particular type of \"thorough examination\" of banking affairs described in the neighboring provisions. And, petitioner adds, \u00a7 484 currently resides in the subchapter <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2728</span> of the statute entitled \"Bank Examinations,\" which still includes a provision directing the Comptroller to appoint examiners \"to make a thorough examination of all the affairs of the bank and . . . make a full and detailed report of the condition of said bank to the Comptroller of the Currency.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 481.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's argument is undermined, however, by other structural attributes of this subchapter. In \u00a7 484(b), for example, Congress provided that \"[n]otwithstanding\" the statute's visitorial-powers prohibition, \"State auditors and examiners may. . . review [a national bank's] records solely to ensure compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or escheat laws.\" Such review does not fall within petitioner's definition of \"visitorial powers\" because the enforcement of state property laws is in no way associated with national bank examinations or internal operations. Thus, were \u00a7 484(a) to have the meaning petitioner assigns, there would have been no reason for Congress to identify the \u00a7 484(b) authority as an exception to \u00a7 484(a)'s \"visitorial powers\" prohibition, as the authority granted in \u00a7 484(b) would never have been eliminated by \u00a7 484(a).</p>\n<p>Other exceptions in \u00a7 484 also support OCC's construction of the statute. For example, \u00a7 484(a) includes an exception for visitations \"authorized by Federal law.\" One type of visitation authorized by law is described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3305(c), which provides that \"[n]othing contained in [\u00a7 484] shall prevent any State from requiring any national\" bank to provide payroll records and reports for unemployment tax purposes. Similarly, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 62 permits state tax officials to inspect national bank shareholder lists. Both provisions would be unnecessary if \"visitorial powers\" were limited to bank examinations and internal operations</p>\n<p>In sum, the NBA's structure does not compel the construction of \u00a7 484(a)'s text that petitioner advocates. If anything, given the manner in which Congress crafted exceptions to the \"visitorial powers\" ban in the statute, the opposite is true.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>The majority also accepts petitioner's contention that OCC's construction of \"visitorial powers\" is unreasonable because it conflicts with several of this Court's decisions. See <i>ante,</i> at 2716-2717. But petitioner cannot prevail by simply showing that this Court previously adopted a construction of \u00a7 484 that differs from the interpretation later chosen by the agency. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2729</span> \"A court's prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to <i>Chevron</i> deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.\" <i>Brand X,</i> 545 U.S., at 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688. These decisions do not construe \u00a7 484 in a manner that trumps OCC's regulation.</p>\n<p>This Court's <i>only</i> decision directly addressing the meaning of \"visitorial powers\" is <i>Guthrie,</i> which held that the NBA did not prohibit a suit brought by a private shareholder seeking to inspect the books of a national bank, 199 U.S., at 157, 26 S.Ct. 4. In so holding, the Court contrasted \"the private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested\" with a visitor's \"public right\" to examine \"the conduct of the corporation with a view to keeping it within its legal powers.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 158-159, 26 S.Ct. 4. <i>Guthrie</i> thus draws a line between enforcement of private rights and the public act of visitation that is consistent with the definition of visitation embraced by OCC. See <i>id.,</i> at 158, 26 S.Ct. 4 (\"In no case or authority that we have been able to find has there been a definition of this right, which would include the private right of the shareholder to have an examination of the business in which he is interested . . .\"). The agency has never taken the position that the \"visitorial powers\" prohibition extends to private action.</p>\n<p>Nor does this Court's decision in <i>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100337\"><a href=\"/opinion/100337/first-nat-bank-in-st-louis-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 44 S.Ct. 213, 68 L.Ed. 486 (1924) <i>(St.Louis),</i> foreclose OCC's construction of the statute. In that case, the State of Missouri brought a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding in state court \"to determine [the national bank's] authority to establish and conduct a branch bank in the City of St. Louis.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 655, 44 S.Ct. 213. The Court first held that federal law did not authorize national banks to engage in branch banking. See <i>id.,</i> at 656-659, 44 S.Ct. 213. \"Having determined that the power sought to be exercised by the bank finds no justification in any law or authority of the United States,\" the Court then concluded that \"the way is open for the enforcement of the state statute.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213.</p>\n<p>Petitioner contends, and the majority agrees, see <i>ante,</i> at 2716-2717, and n. 2, that <i>St. Louis</i> stands for the proposition that a State retains the right to enforce any state law that is not substantively preempted with respect to national banks, see 263 U.S., at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213 (\"To demonstrate the binding quality of a statute but deny the power of enforcement involves a fallacy made apparent by the mere statement of the proposition, for such power is essentially inherent in the very conception of law. . . . What the state is seeking to do is to vindicate and enforce its own law. . .\"). Under this view, then, because the New York fair lending laws are not substantively pre-empted, he is not exercising \"visitorial powers\" by enforcing them.</p>\n<p>Respondents counter that the holding of <i>St. Louis</i> is not so broad. In their view, the Court held only that a State may enforce its laws against a national bank when federal law grants the bank no authority to engage in the underlying activity at issue. See Brief for Respondent Clearing House Association 33-34. Here, federal law expressly authorizes national banks to make mortgage loans. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a). Thus, unlike in <i>St. Louis</i>\u0097in which the relevant state-law-proscribed conduct in a category that was wholly beyond the powers granted to national banks\u0097petitioner seeks to superintend the manner in which the national banks engage in activity expressly authorized by federal law. According to respondents, then, \u00a7 484(a)'s <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2730</span> ban on unauthorized visitation provides the \"controlling reason\" forbidding state enforcement that was absent from <i>St. Louis,</i> see 263 U.S., at 660, 44 S.Ct. 213.</p>\n<p>There is no need to decide which party has the better argument. The <i>St. Louis</i> decision nowhere references \u00a7 484(a) or addresses \"visitorial powers.\" Thus, as noted above, even if the decision is best read to support petitioner's view of the statute, that conclusion is insufficient to deny <i>Chevron</i> deference to OCC's construction of \u00a7 484(a). \"Since <i>Chevron</i> teaches that a court's opinion as to the best reading of an ambiguous statute an agency is charged with administering is not authoritative, the agency's decision to construe that statute differently from a court does not say that the court's holding was legally wrong. Instead, the agency may, consistent with the court's holding, choose a different construction, since the agency remains the authoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of such statutes.\" <i>Brand X,</i> 545 U.S., at 983, 125 S.Ct. 2688. A judicial decision that fails to directly confront the provision at issue cannot be deemed to have adopted the \"authoritative\" construction of the statute.<sup>[3]</sup> Petitioner's reliance on other decisions of this Court is misplaced for this very same reason.

See <i>id.,</i> at 7-8, 127 S.Ct. 1559. In deciding that issue, the Court did not reach the question presented here. But the Court was fully aware that the Michigan statutes granted state banking commissioners the very enforcement authority that petitioner seeks to exert over the national banks in this case. See <i>id.,</i> at 9-10, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (citing Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 445.1661 (West 2002), 493.56b (West Supp.2005)); see also 550 U.S., at 34, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (describing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2731</span> \u00a7\u00a7 445.1661 and 493.56b as \"state visitorial oversight\").<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>As the Court explained, although \"the Michigan provisions at issue exempt[ed] national banks from coverage . . . [t]his [was] not simply a matter of the Michigan Legislature's grace. For, as the parties recognize, the NBA would have preemptive force, <i>i.e.,</i> it would spare a national bank from state controls of the kind here involved.\" 550 U.S., at 13, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (citations omitted); see <i>ibid.</i> (explaining that \"real estate lending, when conducted by a national bank, is immune from state visitorial control\"). The Court's conclusion in <i>Watters</i> that \u00a7 484(a) deprives the States of inspection and enforcement authority over the mortgage-lending practices of national banks lends weight to the agency's construction of the statute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Petitioner also argues that three different background principles trigger a clear-statement rule that overcomes any <i>Chevron</i> deference to which OCC's construction of \u00a7 484 otherwise might be entitled. I disagree. None of petitioner's arguments provide a doctrinal basis for refusing to defer to the agency's reasonable construction of this statute.</p>\n<p>First, petitioner contends that OCC's regulation, which interprets \u00a7 484(a) to pre-empt state enforcement of state law but not the substantive state law itself, undermines important federalism principles and therefore triggers a requirement that Congress clearly state its pre-emptive intentions, see <i>Gregory v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 460, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991) (\"[I]f Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\" (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)). Petitioner is incorrect because OCC's construction of the statute does not alter the balance of power established by the Constitution.</p>\n<p>National banks are created by federal statute and therefore are subject to full congressional control. The States \"can exercise no control over them, nor in any wise affect their operation, except in so far as Congress may see proper to permit.\" <i>Farmers' and Mechanics' Nat. Bank v.

As a result, the only question presented by this case is whether Congress has seen it \"proper to permit\" the States to enforce state fair lending laws against national banks. OCC's reasonable conclusion that \u00a7 484(a) answers that question in the negative does not alter the federal-state balance; it simply preserves for OCC the oversight responsibilities assigned to it by Congress. See <i>id.,</i> at 22, 127 S.Ct. 1559 (\"Regulation of national <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2732</span> bank operations is a prerogative of Congress under the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses.

That the States may also have legislated alongside Congress in this area, see <i>ante,</i> at 2720-2721, does not alter this conclusion, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Franklin Nat. Bank of Franklin Square v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105212\"><a href=\"/opinion/105212/franklin-nat-bank-of-franklin-square-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, 74 S.Ct. 550, 98 L.Ed. 767 (1954).</p>\n<p>Last, petitioner argues that <i>Chevron</i> deference is inapplicable because OCC's regulation declares the pre-emptive scope of the NBA. And, the majority flatly asserts that \"[i]f that is not pre-emption, nothing is.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2721. But OCC did not declare the pre-emptive scope of the statute; rather, it interpreted the term \"visitorial powers\" to encompass state enforcement of state fair lending laws. The pre-emption of state enforcement authority to which petitioner objects thus follows from the statute itself\u0097not agency action. See <i>Smiley,</i> 517 U.S., at 744, 116 S.Ct. 1730 (\"This argument confuses the question of the substantive (as opposed to pre-emptive) <i>meaning</i> of a statute with the question of <i>whether</i> a statute is pre-emptive. We may assume (without deciding) that the latter question must always be decided <i>de novo</i> by the courts. That is <i>not</i> the question at issue here; there is no doubt that \u00a7 85 pre-empts state law\" (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p>Here, Congress\u0097not the agency\u0097has decided that \"[n]o national bank shall be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2733</span> subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a). Indeed, the majority agrees that it is the \"statutory term\"\u0097and not OCC's regulation\u0097that \"define[s] and thereby limit[s] the category of action reserved to the Federal Government and forbidden to the States.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2721. As a result, OCC has simply interpreted that term to encompass petitioner's decision to demand national bank records and threaten judicial enforcement of New York fair lending laws as a means of obtaining them. As <i>Smiley</i> showed, a federal agency's construction of an ambiguous statutory term may clarify the pre-emptive scope of enacted federal law, but that fact alone does not mean that it is the agency, rather than Congress, that has effected the pre-emption.</p>\n<p>Petitioner's federalism-based objections to <i>Chevron</i> deference ultimately turn on a single proposition: It is doubtful that Congress pre-empted state enforcement of state laws but not the underlying state laws themselves. But it is not this Court's task to decide whether the statutory scheme established by Congress is unusual or even \"[b]izarre.\" See <i>ante,</i> at 2718. The Court must decide only whether the construction adopted by the agency is unambiguously foreclosed by the statute's text. Here, the text, structure, and history of \"visitorial powers\" support the agency's reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 484. Petitioner has not identified any constitutional principle that would require Congress to take the greater step of pre-empting all enforcement of state lending laws (including private enforcement) even though its central concern was the allocation of the right to exercise public visitation over national bank activities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For all these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Justice THOMAS's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part (hereinafter the dissent) attempts to distinguish <i>Dartmouth College</i> on the ground that the college was a charitable corporation, whose visitors (unlike the State as visitor of for-profit corporations) had no law-enforcement power. See <i>post,</i> at 2725-2726, n. 1. We doubt that was so. As Justice Story's opinion in <i>Dartmouth College</i> stated, visitors of charitable corporations had \"power . . . to correct all irregularities and abuses,\" 4 Wheat., at 673, 4 L.Ed. 629, which would surely include operations in violation of law. But whether or not visitors of charitable corporations had law-enforcement powers, the powers that they <i>did</i> possess demonstrate that visitation is different from ordinary law enforcement. Indeed, if those powers did not include the power to assure compliance with law that demonstration would be all the more forceful.</p>\n<p>[2]  The dissent attempts to distinguish <i>St. Louis</i> by invoking the principle that an agency is free to depart from a court's interpretation of the law. <i>Post,</i> at 2730-2731 (citing <i>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799969\"><a href=\"/opinion/799969/national-cable-telecommunications-assn-v-brand-x-i/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 982, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005)). This again misses the point. <i>St. Louis</i> is relevant to proper interpretation of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 484(a) not because it is authoritative on the question whether States can enforce their banking laws, but because it is one in a long and unbroken line of cases distinguishing visitation from law enforcement. Respondents contend that <i>St. Louis</i> holds only that States can enforce their law when federal law grants the national bank no authority to engage in the activity at issue. Even if that were true it would make no difference. The case would still stand for the proposition that the exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from enforcing their law.</p>\n<p>[3]  We reject respondents' contention that the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, \u00a7 102(f)(1)(B), 108 Stat. 2349, 2350, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(B), establishes that the Comptroller's visitorial power pre-empts state law enforcement. That provision states that some state laws respecting bank branching \"shall be enforced\" by the Comptroller. We need not decide here whether converting the Comptroller's visitorial <i>power</i> to assure compliance with all applicable laws, see <i>infra,</i> at 2720, into an <i>obligation</i> to assure compliance with certain state laws preempts state enforcement of those particular laws. Even if it had that effect it would shed no light on the meaning of \"visitorial powers\" in the National Bank Act, a statute that it does not refer to and that was enacted more than a century earlier.</p>\n<p>[4]  The prohibition is not entirely categorical only because it is subject to the phrase at the end of the sentence (applicable to all of the regulation's enumerated \"visitorial powers\" forbidden to the States): \"except in limited circumstances authorized by federal law.\" This replicates a similar exception contained in \u00a7 484(a) itself (\"No national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law\"), and certainly does not refer to case law finding state action nonpre-empted. If it meant that, \u00a7 484(a)'s apparent limitation of visitorial powers would be illusory\u0097saying, in effect, that national banks are subject to only those visitorial powers that the courts say they are subject to. Cases that find state action nonpre-empted might perhaps be described as \"permitting\" the state action in question, but hardly as \"authorizing\" it. In both the statutory and regulation context, \"federal law\" obviously means federal statutes.</p>\n<p>[5]  All of these cases were decided before Congress added to \u00a7 484 its current subsection (b), which authorizes \"State auditors and examiners\" to review national-bank records to assure compliance with state unclaimed-property and escheat laws. See 96 Stat. 1521.</p>\n<p>[1]  By looking to Justice Story's concurrence in <i>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85282\"><a href=\"/opinion/85282/dartmouth-college-v-woodward/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 4 L.Ed. 629 (1819), for authoritative guidance, see <i>ante,</i> at 2716-2717, the majority seemingly rejects the distinction between the visitor's role in supervising civil corporations and the visitor's far more limited role in supervising private institutions such as churches, universities, and charitable organizations. See <i>ante,</i> at 2716, n. 1. In <i>Woodward,</i> the Court addressed the scope of the visitor's authority over a private college\u0097not a civil corporation. See 4 Wheat., at 562-563, 4 L.Ed. 629 (\"The corporation in question is not a <i>civil,</i> although it is a <i>lay</i> corporation. It is an <i>eleemosynary</i> corporation. . . . Eleemosynary corporations are for the management of private property, according to the will of the donors. They are private corporations\" (emphasis in original)). Visitors historically did not have \"law enforcement power\" over churches, universities, and charitable organizations. See <i>supra,</i> at 2716-2717. But there is strong evidence that visitors of civil corporations\u0097<i>i.e.,</i> sovereigns\u0097were so empowered. See <i>supra,</i> at 2717-2718. The distinction between these species of visitation is crucial because it yields divergent understandings as to the scope of the visitor's power to enforce generally applicable laws in court. Moreover, the majority's failure to confront this important difference leaves a gap in its historical analysis that, in turn, undermines its conclusion that OCC's interpretation of \u00a7 484(a) was unreasonable.</p>\n<p>[2]  Contrary to the majority's conclusion, see <i>ante,</i> at 2718, n. 3, petitioner's structural argument is also undermined by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (Riegle-Neal), 108 Stat. 2338, which authorized national banks to operate interstate branches. The statute provides that \"[t]he laws of the host State regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and establishment of intrastate branches shall apply to any branch in the host State of an out-of-State national bank to the same extent as such State laws apply to a branch of a bank chartered by that State\" unless federal law separately preempts their application or the Comptroller determines that application of the state law would have a \"discriminatory effect\" on the national bank branch. See <i>id.,</i> at 2349-2350, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(A). Riegle-Neal further provides that \"[t]he provisions of any State law to which a branch of a national bank is subject under this paragraph shall be enforced, with respect to such branch, by the Comptroller of the Currency.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 2350, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f)(1)(B). The United States has interpreted the \"shall be enforced\" language to provide OCC with exclusive enforcement authority. See Brief for Federal Respondent 46-48. This construction reinforces OCC's interpretation of \u00a7 484(a). If OCC has exclusive authority to enforce state law with respect to interstate branches of national banks, it would be reasonable to interpret the statute to operate similarly with respect to the national banks themselves.</p>\n<p>[3]  The majority's suggestion that the Court's decision in <i>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100337\"><a href=\"/opinion/100337/first-nat-bank-in-st-louis-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 44 S.Ct. 213, 68 L.Ed. 486 (1924), is not \"authoritative\" falls short of the mark. See <i>ante,</i> at 2717, n. 2; see, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 2717-2718 (\"[R]eading `visitorial powers' as limiting only sovereign oversight and supervision would produce an entirely commonplace result\u0097the precise result contemplated by our opinion in <i>St. Louis</i>\"). According to the majority, irrespective of which party has the better reading of that case, it \"would still stand for the proposition that the exclusive federal power of visitation does not prevent States from enforcing their law.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2717, n. 2. But that conclusion rests on the assumption that the <i>St. Louis</i> Court shared the majority's conception of law enforcement and visitation as categorically distinct for purposes of \u00a7 484(a). It is impossible to verify that assumption, however, because the bank never raised the \"visitorial powers\" defense in that case. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 6. If the <i>Chevron</i> doctrine is to have any interpretative value, an agency's construction of a statute cannot be foreclosed by a prior judicial decision in which the provision in question was neither raised by the parties nor passed upon by the court.</p>\n<p>[4]  The majority contends that <i>Watters</i> is \"fully in accord with the well established distinction between supervision and law enforcement.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2717. But this argument ignores the reach of the statutes that the Court assumed were visitorial in <i>Watters.</i> The Michigan laws at issue in <i>Watters</i> allowed for much more than \"`general supervision and control'\" of the operating subsidiaries of national banks. <i>Ante,</i> at 2717. They also included provisions permitting the state attorney general to \"take any appropriate legal action to enjoin the operation of the business\" and allowing the commissioner \"[t]o bring an action in . . . circuit court in the name and on behalf of this state\" to enjoin \"any unsafe or injurious practice or act in violation of this act or a rule promulgated under this act.\" Mich.
