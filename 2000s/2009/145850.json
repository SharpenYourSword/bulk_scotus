FLORES ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u2013289.      Argued April 20, 2009\u2014Decided June 25, 2009*\nA group of English Language-Learner (ELL) students and their parents\n   (plaintiffs) filed a class action, alleging that Arizona, its State Board\n   of Education, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction (defen\n   dants) were providing inadequate ELL instruction in the Nogales\n   Unified School District (Nogales), in violation of the Equal Educa\n   tional Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires States to\n   take \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers\u201d in schools,\n   20 U. S. C. \u00a71703(f). In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a\n   declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because\n   the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of\n   ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not re\n   lated to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. The District\n   Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years fol\n   lowing, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions. The de\n   fendants did not appeal any of the District Court\u2019s orders. In 2006,\n   the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, in\n   creased ELL incremental funding. The incremental funding increase\n   required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state\n   attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill.\n   The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing\n   HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here. The\n   Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of\n   the State Senate (Legislators) intervened and, with the superinten\n   dent (collectively, petitioners), moved to purge the contempt order in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 08\u2013294, Speaker of Arizona House of Representa\ntives et al. v. Flores et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2                          HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    light of HB 2064. In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal\n    Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). The District Court denied their mo\n    tion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule\n    60(b)(5) claim. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an\n    evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted\n    Rule 60(b)(5). On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5)\n    motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding\n    system. Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had\n    not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant re\n    lief.\nHeld:\n    1. The superintendent has standing. To establish Article III stand\n ing, a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized,\n and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s chal\n lenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling. Lujan v. De\n fenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561. Here, the superintendent\n was a named defendant, the declaratory judgment held him in viola\n tion of the EEOA, and the injunction runs against him. Because the\n superintendent has standing, the Court need not consider whether\n the Legislators also have standing. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    2. The lower courts did not engage in the proper analysis under\n Rule 60(b)(5). Pp. 10\u201334.\n       (a) Rule 60(b)(5), which permits a party to seek relief from a\n judgment or order if \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions\n or in law\u201d renders continued enforcement \u201cdetrimental to the public\n interest,\u201d Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 384,\n serves a particularly important function in \u201cinstitutional reform liti\n gation,\u201d id., at 380. Injunctions in institutional reform cases often\n remain in force for many years, during which time changed circum\n stances may warrant reexamination of the original judgment. In\n junctions of this sort may also raise sensitive federalism concerns,\n which are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree\n has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities. Finally, in\n stitutional reform injunctions bind state and local officials to their\n predecessors\u2019 policy preferences and may thereby \u201cimproperly deprive\n future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.\u201d\n Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 441. Because of these features of in\n stitutional reform litigation, federal courts must take a \u201cflexible ap\n proach\u201d to Rule 60(b)(5) motions brought in this context, Rufo, supra,\n at 381, ensuring that \u201cresponsibility for discharging the State\u2019s obli\n gations is returned promptly to the State and its officials\u201d when cir\n cumstances warrant, Frew, supra, at 442. Courts must remain atten\n tive to the fact that \u201cfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if\n they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [fed\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\neral law] or . . . flow from such a violation.\u201d Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU. S. 267, 282. Thus, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry\nis whether the EEOA violation underlying the 2000 order has been\nremedied. If it has, the order\u2019s continued enforcement is unnecessary\nand improper. Pp. 10\u201314.\n     (b) The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5)\nanalysis just described. Pp. 14\u201323.\n        (i) Its Rule 60(b)(5) standard was too strict. The Court of Ap\npeals explained that situations in which changed circumstances war\nrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief are \u201clikely rare,\u201d and that, to succeed, peti\ntioners had to show that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to\n\u201csweep away\u201d the District Court\u2019s incremental funding determina\ntion. The Court of Appeals also incorrectly reasoned that federalism\nconcerns were substantially lessened here because the State and the\nState Board of Education wanted the injunction to remain in place.\nPp. 14\u201315.\n        (ii) The Court of Appeals\u2019 inquiry was also too narrow, focusing\nalmost exclusively on the sufficiency of ELL incremental funding. It\nattributed undue significance to petitioners\u2019 failure to appeal the Dis\ntrict Court\u2019s 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexi\nble changed circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo. The Court of\nAppeals\u2019 inquiry was, effectively, an inquiry into whether the 2000\norder had been satisfied. But satisfaction of an earlier judgment is\nonly one of Rule 60(b)(5)\u2019s enumerated bases for relief. Petitioners\ncould obtain relief on the independent basis that prospective en\nforcement of the order was \u201cno longer equitable.\u201d To determine the\nmerits of this claim, the Court of Appeals should have ascertained\nwhether the 2000 order\u2019s ongoing enforcement was supported by an\nongoing EEOA violation. Although the EEOA requires a State to\ntake \u201cappropriate action,\u201d it entrusts state and local authorities with\nchoosing how to meet this obligation. By focusing solely on ELL in\ncremental funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended this man\ndate. And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate \u201cappropriate ac\ntion\u201d through a particular funding mechanism, it improperly\nsubstituted its own policy judgments for those of the state and local\nofficials entrusted with the decisions. Pp. 15\u201318.\n     (c) The District Court\u2019s opinion reveals similar errors. Rather\nthan determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief\nfrom the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied\nthat order through increased ELL incremental funding. Pp. 18\u201320.\n     (d) Because the Court of Appeals and the District Court misper\nceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the\nRule 60(b)(5) inquiry, this case must be remanded for a proper ex\namination of at least four factual and legal changes that may war\n4                          HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    rant relief. Pp. 23\u201334.\n           (i) After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a \u201cbi\n    lingual education\u201d methodology of ELL instruction to \u201cstructured\n    English immersion\u201d (SEI). Research on ELL instruction and findings\n    by the State Department of Education support the view that SEI is\n    significantly more effective than bilingual education. A proper Rule\n    60(b)(5) analysis should entail further factual findings regarding\n    whether Nogales\u2019 implementation of SEI is a \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d\n    warranting relief. Pp. 23\u201325.\n           (ii) Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001\n    (NCLB), which represents another potentially significant \u201cchanged\n    circumstance.\u201d Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily\n    constitute \u201cappropriate action\u201d under the EEOA, NCLB is relevant to\n    petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted\n    the State to make significant structural and programming changes in\n    its ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for\n    education in general and ELL programming in particular; it provided\n    evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales\u2019 ELL students\n    through its assessment and reporting requirements; and it marked a\n    shift in federal education policy. Pp. 25\u201329.\n           (iii) Nogales\u2019 superintendent instituted significant structural\n    and management reforms which, among other things, reduced class\n    sizes, improved student/teacher ratios, and improved the quality of\n    teachers. Entrenched in the incremental funding framework, the\n    lower courts failed to recognize that these changes may have brought\n    Nogales\u2019 ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even\n    without sufficient incremental funding to satisfy the 2000 order.\n    This was error. Because the EEOA focuses on the quality of educa\n    tional programming and services to students, not the amount of\n    money spent, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners\n    from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant ELL pro\n    gramming in ways other than through increased incremental fund\n    ing. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should\n    ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements,\n    Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL\n    students. Pp. 29\u201332.\n           (iv) There was an overall increase in education funding avail\n    able in Nogales. The Court of Appeals foreclosed the possibility that\n    petitioners could show that this overall increase was sufficient to\n    support EEOA-compliant ELL programming. This was clear legal\n    error. The EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement does not neces\n    sarily require a particular level of funding, and to the extent that\n    funding is relevant, the EEOA does not require that the money come\n    from a particular source. Thus, the District Court should evaluate\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      5\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  whether the State\u2019s general education funding budget, in addition to\n  local revenues, currently supports EEOA-compliant ELL program\n  ming in Nogales. Pp. 32\u201334.\n    3. On remand, if petitioners press their objection to the injunction\n  as it extends beyond Nogales, the lower courts should consider\n  whether the District Court erred in entering statewide relief. The re\n  cord contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district\n  other than Nogales failed to provide equal educational opportunities\n  to ELL students, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA\n  can justify a statewide injunction here. The state attorney general\u2019s\n  concern that a \u201cNogales only\u201d remedy would run afoul of the Arizona\n  Constitution\u2019s equal-funding requirement did not provide a valid ba\n  sis for a statewide federal injunction, for it raises a state-law question\n  to be determined by state authorities. Unless the District Court con\n  cludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA statewide, it should vacate\n  the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales.

S. C. \u00a71703(f), which requires a State \u201cto take\nappropriate action to overcome language barriers that\nimpede equal participation by its students in its instruc\ntional programs.\u201d In 2000, the District Court entered a\ndeclaratory judgment with respect to Nogales, and in\n2001, the court extended the order to apply to the entire\nState. Over the next eight years, petitioners repeatedly\nsought relief from the District Court\u2019s orders, but to no\n2                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\navail. We granted certiorari after the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of petitioners\u2019 mo\ntion for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n60(b)(5), and we now reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.\n   As we explain, the District Court and the Court of Ap\npeals misunderstood both the obligation that the EEOA\nimposes on States and the nature of the inquiry that is\nrequired when parties such as petitioners seek relief\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) on the ground that enforcement of a\njudgment is \u201cno longer equitable.\u201d Both of the lower\ncourts focused excessively on the narrow question of the\nadequacy of the State\u2019s incremental funding for ELL\ninstruction instead of fairly considering the broader ques\ntion whether, as a result of important changes during the\nintervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation\nunder the EEOA by other means. The question at issue in\nthese cases is not whether Arizona must take \u201cappropriate\naction\u201d to overcome the language barriers that impede\nELL students. Of course it must. But petitioners argue\nthat Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by\nnew means that reflect new policy insights and other\nchanged circumstances. Rule 60(b)(5) provides the vehicle\nfor petitioners to bring such an argument.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  In 1992, a group of students enrolled in the ELL pro\ngram in Nogales and their parents (plaintiffs) filed suit in\nthe District Court for the District of Arizona on behalf of\n\u201call minority \u2018at risk\u2019 and limited English proficient chil\ndren . . . now or hereafter, enrolled in the Nogales Unified\nSchool District . . . as well as their parents and guardi\nans.\u201d 172 F.

S. C. \u00a71703 (emphasis\n     added).\nBy simply requiring a State \u201cto take appropriate action to\novercome language barriers\u201d without specifying particular\nactions that a State must take, \u201cCongress intended to\nleave state and local educational authorities a substantial\namount of latitude in choosing the programs and tech\nniques they would use to meet their obligations under the\nEEOA.\u201d Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F. 2d 989, 1009 (CA5\n1981).\n  In August 1999, after seven years of pretrial proceed\nings and after settling various claims regarding the struc\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 We have previously held that Congress may validly abrogate the\n\nStates\u2019 sovereign immunity only by doing so (1) unequivocally and (2)\npursuant to certain valid grants of constitutional authority. See, e.g.,\nKimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73 (2000). With respect\nto the second requirement, we have held that statutes enacted pursu\nant to \u00a75 of the Fourteenth Amendment must provide a remedy that is\n\u201ccongruent and proportional\u201d to the injury that Congress intended to\naddress. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997). Prior\nto City of Boerne, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that\nthe EEOA, which was enacted pursuant to \u00a75 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, see 20 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71702(a)(1), (b), validly abrogates the\nStates\u2019 sovereign immunity. See Los Angeles Branch NAACP v. Los\nAngeles Unified School Dist., 714 F. 2d 946, 950\u2013951 (1983); see also\nFlores v. Arizona, 516 F. 3d, 1140, 1146, n. 2 (CA9 2008) (relying on Los\nAngeles NAACP). That issue is not before us in these cases.\n4                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nture of Nogales\u2019 ELL curriculum, the evaluation and moni\ntoring of Nogales\u2019 students, and the provision of tutoring\nand other compensatory instruction, the parties proceeded\nto trial. In January 2000, the District Court concluded\nthat defendants were violating the EEOA because the\namount of funding the State allocated for the special needs\nof ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary\nand not related to the actual funding needed to cover the\ncosts of ELL instruction in Nogales. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1239. Defendants did not appeal the District Court\u2019s\norder.\n                             B\n   In the years following, the District Court entered a\nseries of additional orders and injunctions. In October\n2000, the court ordered the State to \u201cprepare a cost study\nto establish the proper appropriation to effectively imple\nment\u201d ELL programs. 160 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1047. In\nJune 2001, the court applied the declaratory judgment\norder statewide and granted injunctive relief accordingly.\nNo. CIV. 92\u2013596TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, *2 (June\n25, 2001). The court took this step even though the certi\nfied class included only Nogales students and parents and\neven though the court did not find that any districts other\nthan Nogales were in violation of the EEOA. The court set\na deadline of January 31, 2002, for the State to provide\nfunding that \u201cbear[s] a rational relationship to the actual\nfunding needed.\u201d Ibid.\n   In January 2005, the court gave the State 90 days to\n\u201cappropriately and constitutionally fun[d] the state\u2019s ELL\nprograms taking into account the [Rule\u2019s] previous or\nders.\u201d No. CIV. 92\u2013596\u2013TUC\u2013ACM, p. 5, App. 393. The\nState failed to meet this deadline, and in December 2005,\nthe court held the State in contempt.

Id.,\nat 1120\u20131121.\n                             C\n   The defendants did not appeal any of the District\nCourt\u2019s orders, and the record suggests that some state\nofficials supported their continued enforcement. In June\n2001, the state attorney general acquiesced in the state\nwide extension of the declaratory judgment order, a step\nthat the State has explained by reference to the Arizona\nconstitutional requirement of uniform statewide school\nfunding. See Brief for Appellee State of Arizona et al. in\nNo. 07\u201315603 etc. (CA9), p. 60 (citing Ariz. Const., Art. 11,\n\u00a71(A)). At a hearing in February 2006, a new attorney\ngeneral opposed the superintendent\u2019s request for a stay of\nthe December 2005 order imposing sanctions and fines,\nand filed a proposed distribution of the accrued fines.\n   In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines,\nthe state legislature passed HB 2064, which was designed\nto implement a permanent funding solution to the prob\nlems identified by the District Court in 2000. Among\nother things, HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding\n(with a 2-year per-student limit on such funding) and\ncreated two new funds\u2014a structured English immersion\nfund and a compensatory instruction fund\u2014to cover addi\ntional costs of ELL programming. Moneys in both newly\ncreated funds were to be offset by available federal mon\neys. HB 2064 also instituted several programming and\nstructural changes.\n   The Governor did not approve of HB 2064\u2019s funding\nprovisions, but she allowed the bill to become law without\n6                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nher signature. Because HB 2064\u2019s incremental ELL fund\ning increase required court approval to become effective,\nthe Governor requested the attorney general to move for\naccelerated consideration by the District Court. In doing\nso, she explained that \u201c \u2018[a]fter nine months of meetings\nand three vetoes, it is time to take this matter to a federal\njudge. I am convinced that getting this bill into court now\nis the most expeditious way ultimately to bring the state\ninto compliance with federal law.\u2019 \u201d Flores v. Arizona, 516\nF. 3d 1140, 1153, n. 16 (CA9 2008). The State Board of\nEducation joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064.\nTogether, the State Board of Education, the State of Ari\nzona, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.\n   With the principal defendants in the action siding with\nthe plaintiffs, the Speaker of the State House of Represen\ntatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators)\nfiled a motion to intervene as representatives of their\nrespective legislative bodies. App. 55. In support of their\nmotion, they stated that although the attorney general\nhad a \u201clegal duty\u201d to defend HB 2064, the attorney general\nhad shown \u201clittle enthusiasm\u201d for advancing the legisla\nture\u2019s interests. Id., at 57. Among other things, the Legis\nlators noted that the attorney general \u201cfailed to take an\nappeal of the judgment entered in this case in 2000 and\nhas failed to appeal any of the injunctions and other or\nders issued in aid of the judgment.\u201d Id., at 60. The Dis\ntrict Court granted the Legislators\u2019 motion for permissive\nintervention, and the Legislators and superintendent\n(together, petitioners here) moved to purge the District\nCourt\u2019s contempt order in light of HB 2064. Alternatively,\nthey moved for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances.\n   In April 2006, the District Court denied petitioners\u2019\nmotion, concluding that HB 2064 was fatally flawed in\nthree respects. First, while HB 2064 increased ELL in\ncremental funding by approximately $80 per student, the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt held that this increase was not rationally related to\neffective ELL programming. Second, the court concluded\nthat imposing a 2-year limit on funding for each ELL\nstudent was irrational. Third, according to the court, HB\n2064 violated federal law by using federal funds to \u201csup\nplant\u201d rather than \u201csupplement\u201d state funds. No. CV\u201392\u2013\n596\u2013TUC\u2013RCC, pp. 4\u20138 (Apr. 25, 2006), App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 08\u2013294, pp. 176a, 181a\u2013182a. The court did\nnot address petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) claim that changed\ncircumstances rendered continued enforcement of the\noriginal declaratory judgment order inequitable. Petition\ners appealed.\n   In an unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s April 2006\norder, the sanctions, and the imposition of fines, and\nremanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine\nwhether Rule 60(b)(5) relief was warranted. 204 Fed.\nAppx. 580 (2006).\n   On remand, the District Court denied petitioners\u2019 Rule\n60(b)(5) motion. 480 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1167 (Ariz. 2007).\nHolding that HB 2064 did not establish \u201ca funding system\nthat rationally relates funding available to the actual costs\nof all elements of ELL instruction,\u201d id., at 1165, the court\ngave the State until the end of the legislative session to\ncomply with its orders. The State failed to do so, and the\nDistrict Court again held the State in contempt. No. CV\n92\u2013596 TUC\u2013RCC (Oct. 10, 2007), App. 86. Petitioners\nappealed.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 516 F. 3d 1140. It\nacknowledged that Nogales had \u201cmade significant strides\nsince 2000,\u201d id., at 1156, but concluded that the progress\ndid not warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief. Emphasizing that\nRule 60(b)(5) is not a substitute for a timely appeal, and\ncharacterizing the original declaratory judgment order as\ncentering on the adequacy of ELL incremental funding,\nthe Court of Appeals explained that relief would be appro\n8                     HORNE v.

The Court of Appeals concluded that peti\ntioners had made neither showing, and it rejected peti\ntioners\u2019 other arguments, including the claim that Con\ngress\u2019 enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001\n(NCLB), 115 Stat. 1702, as added, 20 U. S. C. \u00a76842 et\nseq., constituted a changed legal circumstance that war\nranted Rule 60(b)(5) relief.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U.

Here, as in all standing inquiries, the\ncritical question is whether at least one petitioner has\n\u201calleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the con\ntroversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court\njurisdiction.\u201d Summers v.

We need\nnot consider whether respondents\u2019 chain-of-command\nargument has merit because the Governor has, in fact,\ndirected an appeal. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner\nSuperintendent 1 (\u201cI hereby direct [the State attorney\ngeneral] to file a brief at the [Supreme] Court on behalf of\nthe State of Arizona adopting and joining in the positions\ntaken by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the\nSpeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and the\nPresident of the Arizona Senate\u201d).\n   Because the superintendent clearly has standing to\nchallenge the lower courts\u2019 decisions, we need not consider\nwhether the Legislators also have standing to do so.2 See,\ne.g., Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 264, and n. 9 (1977) (\u201c[W]e have\nat least one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated\nstanding . . . .

Had the superintendent sought relief based on satisfaction of the\njudgment, the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion might have been correct.\nBut as discussed infra, at 15\u201316, petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) claim is not\nbased on satisfaction of the judgment. Their claim is that continued\nenforcement of the District Court\u2019s orders would be inequitable. This\nclaim implicates the orders in their entirety, and not solely as they run\nagainst the superintendent.\n10                        HORNE v.

Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail, 502 U. S. 367, 384 (1992). The party seeking relief\nbears the burden of establishing that changed circum\nstances warrant relief, id., at 383, but once a party carries\nthis burden, a court abuses its discretion \u201cwhen it refuses\nto modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such\nchanges.\u201d Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.

Post, at 26\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). For nearly a decade, the orders of a federal\ndistrict court have substantially restricted the ability of the State of\nArizona to make basic decisions regarding educational policy, appro\npriations, and budget priorities. The record strongly suggests that\nsome state officials have welcomed the involvement of the federal court\nas a means of achieving appropriations objectives that could not be\nachieved through the ordinary democratic process. See supra, at 5\u20136.\nBecause of these features, these cases implicate all of the unique\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

For one thing, injunctions issued in\nsuch cases often remain in force for many years, and the\npassage of time frequently brings about changed circum\nstances\u2014changes in the nature of the underlying problem,\nchanges in governing law or its interpretation by the\ncourts, and new policy insights\u2014that warrant reexamina\ntion of the original judgment.\n   Second, institutional reform injunctions often raise\nsensitive federalism concerns. Such litigation commonly\ninvolves areas of core state responsibility, such as public\neducation. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 99\n(1995) (\u201c[O]ur cases recognize that local autonomy of\nschool districts is a vital national tradition, and that a\ndistrict court must strive to restore state and local au\nthorities to the control of a school system operating in\ncompliance with the Constitution\u201d (citations omitted));\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 580 (1995)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Federalism concerns are heightened when, as in these\ncases, a federal court decree has the effect of dictating\nstate or local budget priorities. States and local govern\nments have limited funds. When a federal court orders\nthat money be appropriated for one program, the effect is\noften to take funds away from other important programs.\nSee Jenkins, supra, at 131 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cA\nstructural reform decree eviscerates a State\u2019s discretion\nary authority over its own program and budgets and forces\nstate officials to reallocate state resources and funds\u201d).\n   Finally, the dynamics of institutional reform litigation\ndiffer from those of other cases. Scholars have noted that\npublic officials sometimes consent to, or refrain from\nvigorously opposing, decrees that go well beyond what is\nrequired by federal law. See, e.g., McConnell, Why Hold\nElections?

But in recognition of the features of\ninstitutional reform decrees, we have held that courts\nmust take a \u201cflexible approach\u201d to Rule 60(b)(5) motions\naddressing such decrees. Rufo, 502 U. S., at 381. A flexi\nble approach allows courts to ensure that \u201cresponsibility\nfor discharging the State\u2019s obligations is returned\npromptly to the State and its officials\u201d when the circum\nstances warrant. Frew, supra, at 442. In applying this\nflexible approach, courts must remain attentive to the fact\nthat \u201cfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if\nthey are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not\nviolate [federal law] or does not flow from such a viola\ntion.\u201d Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977). \u201cIf [a\nfederal consent decree is] not limited to reasonable and\nnecessary implementations of federal law,\u201d it may \u201cim\nproperly deprive future officials of their designated legis\nlative and executive powers.\u201d Frew, supra, at 441.\n   For these reasons, a critical question in this Rule\n60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the objective of the District\nCourt\u2019s 2000 declaratory judgment order\u2014i.e., satisfaction\nof the EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d standard\u2014has been\nachieved. See 540 U. S., at 442. If a durable remedy has\nbeen implemented, continued enforcement of the order is\nnot only unnecessary, but improper. See Milliken, supra,\nat 282.

Rather than applying a flexible\nstandard that seeks to return control to state and local\nofficials as soon as a violation of federal law has been\nremedied, the Court of Appeals used a heightened stan\ndard that paid insufficient attention to federalism con\ncerns. And rather than inquiring broadly into whether\nchanged conditions in Nogales provided evidence of an\nELL program that complied with the EEOA, the Court of\nAppeals concerned itself only with determining whether\nincreased ELL funding complied with the original declara\ntory judgment order. The court erred on both counts.\n                                1\n   The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion\nby citing the correct legal standard, see 516 F. 3d, at 1163\n(noting that relief is appropriate upon a showing of \u201c \u2018a\nsignificant change either in factual conditions or in law\u2019 \u201d),\nbut it quickly strayed. It referred to the situations in\nwhich changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief\nas \u201clikely rare,\u201d id., at 1167, and explained that, to succeed\non these grounds, petitioners would have to make a show\ning that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to \u201csweep\naway\u201d the District Court\u2019s incremental funding determina\ntion, id., at 1168.

This statement is flatly incorrect, as\neven respondents acknowledge. Brief for Respondent\nState of Arizona et al. 20\u201321. Precisely because different\nstate actors have taken contrary positions in this litiga\ntion, federalism concerns are elevated. And precisely\nbecause federalism concerns are heightened, a flexible\napproach to Rule 60(b)(5) relief is critical. \u201c[W]hen the\nobjects of the decree have been attained\u201d\u2014namely, when\nEEOA compliance has been achieved\u2014\u201cresponsibility for\ndischarging the State\u2019s obligations [must be] returned\npromptly to the State and its officials.\u201d Frew, 540 U. S., at\n442.\n                              2\n  In addition to applying a Rule 60(b)(5) standard that\nwas too strict, the Court of Appeals framed a Rule 60(b)(5)\ninquiry that was too narrow\u2014one that focused almost\nexclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding. In\nlarge part, this was driven by the significance the Court of\nAppeals attributed to petitioners\u2019 failure to appeal the\nDistrict Court\u2019s original order. The Court of Appeals\nexplained that \u201cthe central idea\u201d of that order was that\nwithout sufficient ELL incremental funds, \u201cELL programs\nwould necessarily be inadequate.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1167\u2013\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nby characterizing our discussion as reading them out of context. Post, \n\nat 40\u201341. But we do read these statements in context\u2014in the context \n\nof the Court of Appeals\u2019 overall treatment of petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5)\n\narguments\u2014and it is apparent that they accurately reflect the Court of\n\nAppeals\u2019 excessively narrow understanding of the role of Rule 60(b)(5).\n\n16                       HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1168. It felt bound by this conclusion, lest it allow peti\ntioners to \u201creopen matters made final when the Declara\ntory Judgment was not appealed.\u201d Id., at 1170. It re\npeated this refrain throughout its opinion, emphasizing\nthat the \u201cinterest in finality must be given great weight,\u201d\nid., at 1163, and explaining that petitioners could not now\nask for relief \u201con grounds that could have been raised on\nappeal from the Declaratory Judgment and from earlier\ninjunctive orders but were not,\u201d id., at 1167. \u201cIf [petition\ners] believed that the district court erred and should have\nlooked at all funding sources differently in its EEOA\ninquiry,\u201d the court wrote, \u201cthey should have appealed the\nDeclaratory Judgment.\u201d Id., at 1171.\n   In attributing such significance to the defendants\u2019 fail\nure to appeal the District Court\u2019s original order, the Court\nof Appeals turned the risks of institutional reform litiga\ntion into reality. By confining the scope of its analysis to\nthat of the original order, it insulated the policies embed\nded in the order\u2014specifically, its incremental funding\nrequirement\u2014from challenge and amendment.5 But those\npolicies were supported by the very officials who could\nhave appealed them\u2014the state defendants\u2014and, as a\nresult, were never subject to true challenge.\n   Instead of focusing on the failure to appeal, the Court of\nAppeals should have conducted the type of Rule 60(b)(5)\ninquiry prescribed in Rufo. This inquiry makes no refer\nence to the presence or absence of a timely appeal. It\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This does not mean, as the dissent misleadingly suggests, see post,\n\nat 22, that we are faulting the Court of Appeals for declining to decide\nwhether the District Court\u2019s original order was correct in the first\nplace. On the contrary, as we state explicitly in the paragraph follow\ning this statement, our criticism is that the Court of Appeals did not\nengage in the changed-circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367 (1992). By focusing\nexcessively on the issue of incremental funding, the Court of Appeals\nwas not true to the Rufo standard.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes the original judgment as a given and asks only\nwhether \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions\nor in law\u201d renders continued enforcement of the judgment\n\u201cdetrimental to the public interest.\u201d Rufo, 502 U. S., at\n384. It allows a court to recognize that the longer an\ninjunction or consent decree stays in place, the greater the\nrisk that it will improperly interfere with a State\u2019s democ\nratic processes.\n   The Court of Appeals purported to engage in a \u201cchanged\ncircumstances\u201d inquiry, but it asked only whether changed\ncircumstances affected ELL funding and, more specifi\ncally, ELL incremental funding. Relief was appropriate,\nin the court\u2019s view, only if petitioners \u201cdemonstrate[d]\neither that there [we]re no longer incremental costs asso\nciated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona\u2019s\n\u2018base plus incremental costs\u2019 educational funding model\nwas so altered that focusing on ELL-specific incremental\ncosts funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.\u201d 516\nF. 3d, at 1169.\n   This was a Rule 60(b)(5) \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in\nquiry in name only. In reality, it was an inquiry into\nwhether the deficiency in ELL incremental funding that\nthe District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied.\nAnd this, effectively, was an inquiry into whether the\noriginal order had been satisfied. Satisfaction of an earlier\njudgment is one of the enumerated bases for Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief\u2014but it is not the only basis for such relief.\n   Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where \u201c[i]\nthe judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged;\n[ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has been re\nversed or vacated; or [iii] applying it prospectively is no\nlonger equitable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Use of the disjunc\ntive \u201cor\u201d makes it clear that each of the provision\u2019s three\ngrounds for relief is independently sufficient and therefore\nthat relief may be warranted even if petitioners have not\n\u201csatisfied\u201d the original order. As petitioners argue, they\n18                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay obtain relief if prospective enforcement of that order\n\u201cis no longer equitable.\u201d\n   To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of\nAppeals needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement\nof the original order was supported by an ongoing violation\nof federal law (here, the EEOA). See Milliken, 433 U. S.,\nat 282. It failed to do so.\n   As previously noted, the EEOA, while requiring a State\nto take \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barri\ners,\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a71703(f), \u201cleave[s] state and local educa\ntional authorities a substantial amount of latitude in\nchoosing\u201d how this obligation is met. Castaneda, 648\nF. 2d, at 1009. Of course, any educational program, in\ncluding the \u201cappropriate action\u201d mandated by the EEOA,\nrequires funding, but funding is simply a means, not the\nend. By focusing so intensively on Arizona\u2019s incremental\nELL funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the\nEEOA\u2019s mandate. And by requiring petitioners to demon\nstrate \u201cappropriate action\u201d through a particular funding\nmechanism, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted\nits own educational and budgetary policy judgments for\nthose of the state and local officials to whom such deci\nsions are properly entrusted. Cf. Jenkins, 515 U. S., at\n131 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cFederal courts do not pos\nsess the capabilities of state and local governments in\naddressing difficult educational problems\u201d).\n                            C\n   The underlying District Court opinion reveals similar\nerrors. In an August 2006 remand order, a different Ninth\nCircuit panel had instructed the District Court to hold an\nevidentiary hearing \u201cregarding whether changed circum\nstances required modification of the original court order or\notherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.\u201d 204\nFed. Appx., at 582. The Ninth Circuit panel observed that\n\u201cfederal courts must be sensitive to the need for modifica\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion [of permanent injunctive relief] when circumstances\nchange.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The District Court failed to follow these instructions.\nInstead of determining whether changed circumstances\nwarranted modification of the original order, the District\nCourt asked only whether petitioners had satisfied the\noriginal declaratory judgment order through increased\nincremental funding. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (ex\nplaining that a showing of \u201cmere amelioration\u201d of the\nspecific deficiencies noted in the District Court\u2019s original\norder was \u201cinadequate\u201d and that \u201ccompliance would re\nquire a funding system that rationally relates funding\navailable to the actual costs of all elements of ELL in\nstruction\u201d (emphasis added)). The District Court stated:\n\u201cIt should be noted that the Court finds the same problems\ntoday that it saw last year, because HB 2064 is the same,\nthe problems themselves are the same.6 Id., at 1161. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In addition to concluding that the law\u2019s increase in incremental\n\nfunding was insufficient and that 2-year cutoff was irrational, both the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals held that HB 2064\u2019s funding\nmechanism violates NCLB, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA State\nshall not take into consideration payments under this chapter . . . in\ndetermining the eligibility of any local educational agency in that State\nfor State aid, or the amount of State aid, with respect to free public\neducation of children.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a77902. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1166\n(HB 2064\u2019s funding mechanism is \u201cabsolutely forbidden\u201d by \u00a77902); 516\nF. 3d, at 1178 (\u201cHB 2064 . . . violates [\u00a77902] on its face\u201d). Whether or\nnot HB 2064 violates \u00a77902, see Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 31\u201332, and n. 8 (suggesting it does), neither court below was\nempowered to decide the issue. As the Court of Appeals itself recog\nnized, NCLB does not provide a private right of action. See 516 F. 3d,\nat 1175. \u201cWithout [statutory intent], a cause of action does not exist\nand courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be\nas a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.\u201d Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286\u2013287 (2001). Thus, NCLB is enforceable\nonly by the agency charged with administering it. See id., at 289\u2013290;\nsee also App. to Brief for Respondent State of Arizona et al. 1\u20134 (letter\nfrom U. S. Department of Education to petitioner superintendent\nconcerning the legality vel non of HB 2064).\n20                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court thus rested its postremand decision on its\npreremand analysis of HB 2064. It disregarded the re\nmand instructions to engage in a broad and flexible Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis as to whether changed circumstances\nwarranted relief. In taking this approach, the District\nCourt abused its discretion.\n                              D\n   The dissent defends the narrow approach of the lower\ncourts with four principal conclusions that it draws from\nthe record. All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect\nand mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts\u2014a\nfixation on the issue of incremental funding and a failure\nto recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry.\n   First, the dissent concludes that \u201cthe Rule 60(b)(5)\n\u2018changes\u2019 upon which the District Court focused\u201d were not\nlimited to changes in funding, and included \u201c \u2018changed\nteaching methods\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018changed administrative sys\ntems.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 12. The District Court did note a range of\nchanged circumstances, concluding that as a result of\nthese changes, Nogales was \u201cdoing substantially better.\u201d\n480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160. But it neither focused on these\nchanges nor made up-to-date factual findings. To the\ncontrary, the District Court explained that \u201cit would be\npremature to make an assessment of some of these\nchanges.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, of the 28 findings of fact that\nthe court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed fund\ning directly and exclusively. See id., at 1161\u20131163. The\nlast eight addressed funding indirectly\u2014discussing reclas\nsification rates because of their relevance to HB 2064\u2019s\nfunding restrictions for ELL and reclassified students.\nSee id., at 1163\u20131165. None of the District Court\u2019s find\nings of fact addressed either \u201c \u2018changed teaching methods\u2019 \u201d\nor \u201c \u2018changed administrative systems.\u2019 \u201d\n   The dissent\u2019s second conclusion is that \u201c \u2018incremental\nfunding\u2019 costs . . . [were] the basic contested issue at the\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court\u2019s find\ning of a statutory violation.\u201d Post, at 12. We fail to see\nthis conclusion\u2019s relevance to this Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\nwhere the question is whether any change in factual or\nlegal circumstances renders continued enforcement of the\noriginal order inequitable. As the dissent itself acknowl\nedges, petitioners \u201cpointed to three sets of changed cir\ncumstances [in their Rule 60(b)(5) motion] which, in their\nview, showed that the judgment and the related orders\nwere no longer necessary.\u201d Post, at 11. In addition to\n\u201cincreases in the amount of funding available to Arizona\nschool districts,\u201d these included \u201cchanges in the method of\nEnglish-learning instruction,\u201d and \u201cchanges in the admini\nstration of the Nogales school district.\u201d Ibid.\n  Third, the dissent concludes that \u201cthe type of issue upon\nwhich the District Court and Court of Appeals focused\u201d\u2014\nthe incremental funding issue\u2014\u201clies at the heart of the\nstatutory demand for equal educational opportunity.\u201d\nPost, at 13. In what we interpret to be a restatement of\nthis point, the dissent also concludes that sufficient fund\ning (\u201cthe \u2018resource\u2019 issue\u201d) and the presence or absence of\nan EEOA violation (\u201cthe statutory subsection (f) issue\u201d) \u201care\none and the same.\u201d Post, at 14 (emphasis in original). \u201cIn\nfocusing upon the one,\u201d the dissent asserts, \u201cthe District\nCourt and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.\u201d\nIbid.\n  Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, these two issues are\ndecidedly not \u201cone and the same.\u201d7 Ibid. Nor is it the case,\nas the dissent suggests, that the EEOC targets States\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The extent to which the dissent repeats the errors of the courts be\n\nlow is evident in its statement that \u201c[t]he question here is whether the\nState has shown that its new funding program amounts to a \u2018change\u2019\nthat satisfies subsection (f)\u2019s requirement.\u201d Post, at 40 (emphasis\nadded). The proper inquiry is not limited to the issue of funding.\nRather, it encompasses the question whether the State has shown any\nfactual or legal changes that establish compliance with the EEOA.\n22                        HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision of resources for ELL programming.8 Post, at 13.\nWhat the statute forbids is a failure to take \u201cappropriate\naction to overcome language barriers.\u201d          20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71703(f). Funding is merely one tool that may be em\nployed to achieve the statutory objective.\n  Fourth, the dissent concludes that the District Court did\nnot order increased ELL incremental funding and did not\ndictate state and local budget priorities. Post, at 15. The\ndissent\u2019s point\u2014and it is a very small one\u2014is that the\nDistrict Court did not set a specific amount that the legis\nlature was required to appropriate. The District Court\ndid, however, hold the State in contempt and impose\nheavy fines because the legislature did not provide suffi\ncient funding. These orders unquestionably imposed\nimportant restrictions on the legislature\u2019s ability to set\nbudget priorities.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The dissent cites two sources for this proposition.        The first\u2014\nCastaneda v. Pickard, 648 F. 2d 989 (CA5 1981)\u2014sets out a three-part\ntest for \u201cappropriate action.\u201d Under that test, a State must (1) formu\nlate a sound English language instruction educational plan, (2) imple\nment that plan, and (3) achieve adequate results. See id., at 1009\u2013\n1010. Whether or not this test provides much concrete guidance\nregarding the meaning of \u201cappropriate action,\u201d the test does not focus\non incremental funding or on the provision of resources more generally.\n   The second source cited by the dissent\u2014curiously\u2014is a speech given\nby President Nixon in which he urged prompt action by Congress on\nlegislation imposing a moratorium on new busing orders and on the\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act of 1972. See post, at 13 (citing\nAddress to the Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8\nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 590, 591 (1972)). In the speech, President\nNixon said that schools in poor neighborhoods should receive the\n\u201cfinancial support . . . that we know can make all the difference.\u201d Id.,\nat 593. It is likely that this statement had nothing to do with the\ninterpretation of EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement and instead\nreferred to his proposal to \u201cdirec[t] over $21\u20442 billion in the next year\nmainly towards improving the education of children from poor fami\nlies.\u201d Id., at 591. But in any event, this general statement, made in a\npresidential speech two years prior to the enactment of the EEOA,\nsurely sheds little light on the proper interpretation of the statute.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)         23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                            E\n  Because the lower courts\u2014like the dissent\u2014\nmisperceived both the nature of the obligation imposed by\nthe EEOA and the breadth of the inquiry called for under\nRule 60(b)(5), these cases must be remanded for a proper\nexamination of at least four important factual and legal\nchanges that may warrant the granting of relief from the\njudgment: the State\u2019s adoption of a new ELL instructional\nmethodology, Congress\u2019 enactment of NCLB, structural\nand management reforms in Nogales, and increased over\nall education funding.\n                             1\n  At the time of the District Court\u2019s original declaratory\njudgment order, ELL instruction in Nogales was based\nprimarily on \u201cbilingual education,\u201d which teaches core\ncontent areas in a student\u2019s native language while provid\ning English instruction in separate language classes. In\nNovember 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203,\nwhich mandated statewide implementation of a \u201cstruc\ntured English immersion\u201d (SEI) approach. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 08\u2013294, p. 369a. Proposition 203\ndefines this methodology as follows:\n    \u201c \u2018Sheltered English immersion\u2019 or \u2018structured English\n    immersion\u2019 means an English language acquisition\n    process for young children in which nearly all class\n    room instruction is in English but with the curriculum\n    and presentation designed for children who are learn\n    ing the language. . . . Although teachers may use a\n    minimal amount of the child\u2019s native language when\n    necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any\n    language other than English, and children in this pro\n    gram learn to read and write solely in English.\u201d Ariz.\n    Rev.

S. C. \u00a76311(b)(2). NCLB conditions the\ncontinued receipt of funds on demonstrations of \u201cadequate\nyearly progress.\u201d Ibid.\n   As relevant here, Title III (the English Language Acqui\nsition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achieve\nment Act) requires States to ensure that ELL students\n\u201cattain English proficiency, develop high levels of aca\ndemic attainment in English, and meet the same challeng\ning State academic content and student academic\nachievement standards as all children are expected to\nmeet.\u201d \u00a76812(1). It requires States to set annual objective\nachievement goals for the number of students who will\nannually progress toward proficiency, achieve proficiency,\nand make \u201cadequate yearly progress\u201d with respect to\nacademic achievement, \u00a76842(a), and it holds local schools\nand agencies accountable for meeting these objectives,\n\u00a76842(b).\n   Petitioners argue that through compliance with NCLB,\nthe State has established compliance with the EEOA.\n26                       HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThey note that when a State adopts a compliance plan\nunder NCLB\u2014as the State of Arizona has\u2014it must pro\nvide adequate assurances that ELL students will receive\nassistance \u201cto achieve at high levels in the core academic\nsubjects so that those children can meet the same . . .\nstandards as all children are expected to meet.\u201d \u00a76812(2).\nThey argue that when the Federal Department of Educa\ntion approves a State\u2019s plan\u2014as it has with respect to\nArizona\u2019s\u2014it offers definitive evidence that the State has\ntaken \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the EEOA. \u00a71703(f).\n   The Court of Appeals concluded, and we agree, that\nbecause of significant differences in the two statutory\nschemes, compliance with NCLB will not necessarily\nconstitute \u201cappropriate action\u201d under the EEOA. 516\nF. 3d, at 1172\u20131176. Approval of a NCLB plan does not\nentail substantive review of a State\u2019s ELL programming or\na determination that the programming results in equal\neducational opportunity for ELL students. See \u00a76823.\nMoreover, NCLB contains a saving clause, which provides\nthat \u201c[n]othing in this part shall be construed in a manner\ninconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil\nright.\u201d \u00a76847.\n   This does not mean, however, that NCLB is not relevant\nto petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion. To the contrary, we\nthink it is probative in four principal ways.12 First, it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Although the dissent contends that the sole argument raised below\nregarding NCLB was that compliance with that Act necessarily consti\ntuted compliance with the EEOA, the Court of Appeals recognized that\nNCLB is a relevant factor that should be considered under Rule\n60(b)(5). It acknowledged that compliance with NCLB is at least\n\u201csomewhat probative\u201d of compliance with the EEOA. 516 F. 3d, at\n1175, n. 46. The United States, in its brief as amicus curiae supporting\nrespondents, similarly observed that, \u201c[e]ven though Title III participa\ntion is not a complete defense under the EEOA, whether a State is\nreaching its own goals under Title III may be relevant in an EEOA\nsuit.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.

These changes should not be discounted in the\nRule 60(b)(5) analysis solely because they do not require or\nresult from increased funding. Second, NCLB signifi\ncantly increased federal funding for education in general\nand ELL programming in particular.14 These funds\nshould not be disregarded just because they are not state\nfunds. Third, through its assessment and reporting re\nquirements, NCLB provides evidence of the progress and\nachievement of Nogales\u2019 ELL students.15 This evidence\ncould provide persuasive evidence of the current effective\nness of Nogales\u2019 ELL programming.16\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCourt noted that, \u201c[b]y increasing the standards of accountability,\n[NCLB] has to some extent significantly changed State educators\napproach to educating students in Arizona.\u201d 480 F.

NCLB\ngrants States \u201cflexibility\u201d to adopt ELL programs they\nbelieve are \u201cmost effective for teaching English.\u201d \u00a76812(9).\nReflecting a growing consensus in education research that\nincreased funding alone does not improve student\nachievement,17 NCLB expressly refrains from dictating\nfunding levels. Instead, it focuses on the demonstrated\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\napparent in the AIMS test results and reclassification test results\u201d); id.,\nat 1169\u20131170 (citing \u201cthe persistent achievement gaps documented in\n[Nogales\u2019] AIMS test data\u201d between ELL students and native speakers).\nWe do not think the District Court made sufficient factual findings to\nsupport its conclusions about the effectiveness of Nogales\u2019 ELL pro\ngramming, and we question the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the\ndata for three reasons. First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the\nabsence of longitudinal data in the record precludes useful compari\nsons. See id., at 1155. Second, the AIMS tests\u2014the statewide\nachievement tests on which the Court of Appeals primarily relied and\nto which the dissent cites in Appendix A of its opinion\u2014are adminis\ntered in English. It is inevitable that ELL students (who, by definition,\nare not yet proficient in English) will underperform as compared to\nnative speakers. Third, the negative data that the Court of Appeals\nhighlights is balanced by positive data. See, e.g., App. 97 (reporting\nthat for the 2005\u20132006 school year, on average, reclassified students\ndid as well as, if not better than, native English speakers on the AIMS\ntests).\n  17 See, e.g., Hanushek, The Failure of Input-Based Schooling Policies,\n\n113 Economic J. F64, F69 (2003) (reviewing U. S. data regarding \u201cinput\npolicies\u201d and concluding that although such policies \u201chave been vigor\nously pursued over a long period of time,\u201d there is \u201cno evidence that the\nadded resources have improved student performance\u201d); A.

This conflict with\nCongress\u2019 determination of federal policy may constitute a\nsignificantly changed circumstance, warranting relief. See\nRailway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 651 (1961)\n(noting that a court decree should be modified when \u201ca\nchange in law brings [the decree] in conflict with statutory\nobjectives\u201d).\n                             3\n  Structural and management reforms in Nogales consti\ntute another relevant change in circumstances. These\nreforms were led by Kelt Cooper, the Nogales superinten\ndent from 2000 to 2005, who \u201cadopted policies that amelio\nrated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies\ndiscussed by the district court.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1156.\nAmong other things, Cooper \u201creduce[d] class sizes,\u201d \u201csig\nnificantly improv[ed] student/teacher ratios,\u201d \u201cimproved\nteacher quality,\u201d \u201cpioneered a uniform system of textbook\nand curriculum planning,\u201d and \u201clargely eliminated what\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 Education literature overwhelmingly supports reliance on account\nability-based reforms as opposed to pure increases in spending. See,\ne.g., Hanushek & Raymond, Does School Accountability Lead to Im\nproved Student Performance? 24 J. Pol\u2019y Analysis & Mgmt. 297, 298\n(2005) (concluding that \u201cthe introduction of accountability systems into\na state tends to lead to larger achievement growth than would have\noccurred without accountability\u201d); U.

FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been a severe shortage of instructional materials.\u201d\nId., at 1156\u20131157. The Court of Appeals recognized that\nby \u201c[u]sing careful financial management and applying for\n\u2018all funds available,\u2019 Cooper was able to achieve his re\nforms with limited resources.\u201d Id., at 1157. But the Court\nof Appeals missed the legal import of this observation\u2014\nthat these reforms might have brought Nogales\u2019 ELL\nprogramming into compliance with the EEOA even with\nout sufficient ELL incremental funding to satisfy the\nDistrict Court\u2019s original order. Instead, the Court of Ap\npeals concluded that to credit Cooper\u2019s reforms would\n\u201cpenaliz[e]\u201d Nogales \u201cfor doing its best to make do, despite\nArizona\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the judg\nment,\u201d and would \u201cabsolve the state from providing ade\nquate ELL incremental funding as required by the judg\nment.\u201d    Id., at 1168.      The District Court similarly\ndiscounted Cooper\u2019s achievements, acknowledging that\nNogales was \u201cdoing substantially better than it was in\n2000,\u201d but concluding that because the progress resulted\nfrom management efforts rather than increased funding,\nits progress was \u201cfleeting at best.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1160.\n   Entrenched in the framework of incremental funding,\nboth courts refused to consider that Nogales could be\ntaking \u201cappropriate action\u201d to address language barriers\neven without having satisfied the original order. This was\nerror. The EEOA seeks to provide \u201cequal educational\nopportunity\u201d to \u201call children enrolled in public schools.\u201d\n\u00a71701(a). Its ultimate focus is on the quality of educa\ntional programming and services provided to students, not\nthe amount of money spent on them. Accordingly, there is\nno statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing\nthat Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant programming\nby means other than increased funding\u2014for example,\nthrough Cooper\u2019s structural, curricular, and accountabil\nity-based reforms. The weight of research suggests that\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   31\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthese types of local reforms, much more than court\nimposed funding mandates, lead to improved educational\nopportunities.19 Cooper even testified that, without the\nstructural changes he imposed, \u201cadditional money\u201d would\nnot \u201chave made any difference to th[e] students\u201d in No\ngales. Addendum to Reply Brief for Petitioner Speaker of\nthe Arizona House of Representatives et al. 15.\n   The Court of Appeals discounted Cooper\u2019s reforms for\nother reasons as well. It explained that while they \u201cdid\nameliorate many of the specific examples of resource\nshortages that the district court identified in 2000,\u201d they\ndid not \u201cresult in such success as to call into serious ques\ntion [Nogales\u2019] need for increased incremental funds.\u201d 516\nF. 3d, at 1169. Among other things, the Court of Appeals\nreferred to \u201cthe persistent achievement gaps documented\nin [Nogales\u2019] AIMS test data\u201d between ELL students and\nnative speakers, id., at 1170, but any such comparison\nmust take into account other variables that may explain\nthe gap. In any event, the EEOA requires \u201cappropriate\naction\u201d to remove language barriers, \u00a71703(f), not the\nequalization of results between native and nonnative\nspeakers on tests administered in English\u2014a worthy goal,\nto be sure, but one that may be exceedingly difficult to\nachieve, especially for older ELL students.\n   The Court of Appeals also referred to the subpar per\nformance of Nogales\u2019 high schools. There is no doubt that\nNogales\u2019 high schools represent an area of weakness, but\nthe District Court made insufficient factual findings to\nsupport a conclusion that the high schools\u2019 problems stem\nfrom a failure to take \u201cappropriate action,\u201d and constitute\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 See, e.g., M.

FLORES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\na violation of the EEOA.20\n   The EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement grants\nStates broad latitude to design, fund, and implement ELL\nprograms that suit local needs and account for local condi\ntions. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this\nand should ask whether, as a result of structural and\nmanagerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal\neducational opportunities to ELL students.\n                             4\n  A fourth potentially important change is an overall\nincrease in the education funding available in Nogales.\nThe original declaratory judgment order noted five sources\nof funding that collectively financed education in the\nState: (1) the State\u2019s \u201cbase level\u201d funding, (2) ELL incre\nmental funding, (3) federal grants, (4) regular district and\ncounty taxes, and (5) special voter-approved district and\ncounty taxes called \u201coverrides.\u201d 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1227.\nAll five sources have notably increased since 2000.21\nNotwithstanding these increases, the Court of Appeals\nrejected petitioners\u2019 claim that overall education funds\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 There are many possible causes for the performance of students in\n\nNogales\u2019 high school ELL programs. These include the difficulty of\nteaching English to older students (many of whom, presumably, were\nnot in English-speaking schools as younger students) and problems,\nsuch as drug use and the prevalence of gangs. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 14\u2013\n15; Reply Brief for Petitioner Superintendent 16\u201317; App. 116\u2013118. We\nnote that no court has made particularized findings as to the effective\nness of ELL programming offered at Nogales\u2019 high schools.\n  21 The Court of Appeals reported, and it is not disputed, that \u201c[o]n an\n\ninflation-adjusted statewide basis, including all sources of funding,\nsupport for education has increased from $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to an\nestimated $3,570 per pupil in 2006. Adding in all county and local\nsources, funding has gone from $5,677 per pupil in 2000 to an esti\nmated $6,412 per pupil in 2006. Finally, federal funding has increased.\nIn 2000, the federal government provided an additional $526 per pupil;\nin 2006, it provided an estimated $953.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1155.\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                33\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwere sufficient to support EEOA-compliant programming\nin Nogales. The court reasoned that diverting base-level\neducation funds would necessarily hurt other state educa\ntional programs, and was not, therefore, an \u201c \u2018appropriate\u2019\nstep.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1171. In so doing, it foreclosed the\npossibility that petitioners could establish changed cir\ncumstances warranting relief through an overall increase\nin education funding available in Nogales.\n   This was clear legal error. As we have noted, the\nEEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement does not neces\nsarily require any particular level of funding, and to the\nextent that funding is relevant, the EEOA certainly does\nnot require that the money come from any particular\nsource. In addition, the EEOA plainly does not give the\nfederal courts the authority to judge whether a State or a\nschool district is providing \u201cappropriate\u201d instruction in\nother subjects. That remains the province of the States\nand the local schools. It is unfortunate if a school, in order\nto fund ELL programs, must divert money from other\nworthwhile programs, but such decisions fall outside the\nscope of the EEOA. Accordingly, the analysis of petition\ners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion should evaluate whether the\nState\u2019s budget for general education funding, in addition\nto any local revenues,22 is currently supporting EEOA\ncompliant ELL programming in Nogales.\n   Because the lower courts engaged in an inadequate Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis, and because the District Court failed to\nmake up-to-date factual findings, the analysis of the lower\ncourts was incomplete and inadequate with respect to all\nof the changed circumstances just noted. These changes\nare critical to a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, however, as\nthey may establish that Nogales is no longer in violation of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  22 Each year since 2000, Nogales voters have passed an override.\n\nRevenues from Nogales\u2019 override have increased from $895,891 in 2001\nto $1,674,407 in 2007.

FLORES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe EEOA and, to the contrary, is taking \u201cappropriate\naction\u201d to remove language barriers in its schools. If this\nis the case, continued enforcement of the District Court\u2019s\noriginal order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule\n60(b)(5), and relief is warranted.\n                              IV\n   We turn, finally, to the District Court\u2019s entry of state\nwide relief.23 The Nogales district, which is situated along\nthe Mexican border, is one of 239 school districts in the\nState of Arizona. Nogales students make up about one\nhalf of one per cent of the entire State\u2019s school popula\ntion.24 The record contains no factual findings or evidence\nthat any school district other than Nogales failed (much\nless continues to fail) to provide equal educational oppor\ntunities to ELL students. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n08\u2013294, pp. 177a\u2013178a. Nor have respondents explained\nhow the EEOA could justify a statewide injunction when\nthe only violation claimed or proven was limited to a\nsingle district. See Jenkins, 515 U. S., at 89\u201390; Milliken,\n433 U. S., at 280. It is not even clear that the District\nCourt had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   23 The dissent contends that this issue was not raised below, but what\n\nis important for present purposes is that, for the reasons explained in\nthe previous parts of this opinion, these cases must be remanded to the\nDistrict Court for a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis. Petitioners made it\nclear at oral argument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63 (\u201cHere the EEOA has been transmogrified to apply state\nwide. That has not been done before. It should not have been done in\nthe first instance but certainly in light of the changed circumstances\u201d);\nsee also id., at 17\u201318, 21, 26. Accordingly, if petitioners raise that\nargument on remand, the District Court must consider whether there is\nany legal or factual basis for denying that relief.\n   24 See Ariz.

We are told that the former attorney general\n\u201caffirmatively urged a statewide remedy because a \u2018No\ngales only\u2019 remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Consti\ntution\u2019s requirement of \u2018a general and uniform public\nschool system.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent Flores et al. 38\n(quoting Ariz. Const., Art. 11, \u00a71(A) (some internal quota\ntion marks omitted)).\n   This concern did not provide a valid basis for a state\nwide federal injunction. If the state attorney general\nbelieved that a federal injunction requiring increased ELL\nspending in one district necessitated, as a matter of state\nlaw, a similar increase in every other district in the State,\nthe attorney general could have taken the matter to the\nstate legislature or the state courts. But the attorney\ngeneral did not do so. Even if she had, it is not clear what\nthe result would have been. It is a question of state law,\nto be determined by state authorities, whether the equal\nfunding provision of the Arizona Constitution would re\nquire a statewide funding increase to match Nogales\u2019 ELL\nfunding, or would leave Nogales as a federally compelled\nexception. By failing to recognize this, and by entering a\nstatewide injunction that intruded deeply into the State\u2019s\nbudgetary processes based solely on the attorney general\u2019s\ninterpretation of state law, the District Court obscured\naccountability for the drastic remedy that it entered.\n   When it is unclear whether an onerous obligation is the\nwork of the Federal or State Government, accountability is\ndiminished. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n169 (1992). Here, the District Court \u201cimproperly pre\nvent[ed] the citizens of the State from addressing the issue\n[of statewide relief] through the processes provided by the\n36                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState\u2019s constitution.\u201d Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Af\nfairs, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 12). Assuming\nthat petitioners, on remand, press their objection to the\nstatewide extension of the remedy, the District Court\nshould vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond\nNogales unless the court concludes that Arizona is violat\ning the EEOA on a statewide basis.\n  There is no question that the goal of the EEOA\u2014\novercoming language barriers\u2014is a vitally important one,\nand our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to\nachieve that goal. If petitioners are ultimately granted\nrelief from the judgment, it will be because they have\nshown that the Nogales School District is doing exactly\nwhat this statute requires\u2014taking \u201cappropriate action\u201d to\nteach English to students who grew up speaking another\nlanguage.\n                       *   *     *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the cases for the District Court to determine\nwhether, in accordance with the standards set out in this\nopinion, petitioners should be granted relief from the\njudgment.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The judgment held that the\nState of Arizona\u2019s plan for funding its English Language\nLearner program was arbitrary, and therefore the State\nhad failed to take \u201cappropriate action to overcome lan\u00ad\nguage barriers that impede equal participation by its\u201d\nSpanish-speaking public school students \u201cin its instruc\u00ad\ntional programs.\u201d 20 U.

The moving parties\n2                     HORNE v.

S. 367, 384 (1992), entitled them to relief. The\nState of Arizona, the Arizona Board of Education, and the\noriginal plaintiffs in the case (representing students from\nNogales, Arizona) opposed the superintendent\u2019s Rule\n60(b)(5) motion. They are respondents here.\n   The District Court, after taking evidence and holding\neight days of hearings, considered all the changed circum\u00ad\nstances that the parties called to its attention. The court\nconcluded that some relevant \u201cchanges\u201d had taken place.\nBut the court ultimately found those changes insufficient\nto warrant setting aside the original judgment. The Court\nof Appeals, in a carefully reasoned 41-page opinion, af\u00ad\nfirmed that district court determination. This Court now\nsets the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision aside. And it does so, it\nsays, because \u201cthe lower courts focused excessively on the\nnarrow question of the adequacy of the State\u2019s incremental\nfunding for [English-learning] instruction instead of fairly\nconsidering the broader question, whether, as a result of\nimportant changes during the intervening years, the State\nwas fulfilling its obligation\u201d under the Act \u201cby other\nmeans.\u201d Ante, at 2 (emphasis added).\n   The Court reaches its ultimate conclusion\u2014that the\nlower courts did not \u201cfairly consider\u201d the changed circum\u00ad\nstances\u2014in a complicated way. It begins by placing this\ncase in a category it calls \u201cinstitutional reform litigation.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. It then sets forth special \u201cinstitutional reform\nlitigation\u201d standards applicable when courts are asked to\nmodify judgments and decrees entered in such cases. It\napplies those standards, and finds that the lower courts\ncommitted error.\n   I disagree with the Court for several reasons. For one\nthing, the \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d label does not easily fit\nthis case. For another, the review standards the Court\nenunciates for \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d cases are incomplete\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand, insofar as the Court applies those standards here,\nthey effectively distort Rule 60(b)(5)\u2019s objectives. Finally,\nmy own review of the record convinces me that the Court\nis wrong regardless. The lower courts did \u201cfairly consider\u201d\nevery change in circumstances that the parties called to\ntheir attention. The record more than adequately supports\nthis conclusion. In a word, I fear that the Court misap\u00ad\nplies an inappropriate procedural framework, reaching a\nresult that neither the record nor the law adequately\nsupports. In doing so, it risks denying schoolchildren the\nEnglish-learning instruction necessary \u201cto overcome lan\u00ad\nguage barriers that impede\u201d their \u201cequal participation.\u201d\n20 U. S. C. \u00a71703(f).\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  To understand my disagreement with the Court, it is\nunfortunately necessary to examine the record at length\nand in detail. I must initially focus upon the Court\u2019s basic\ncriticism of the lower courts\u2019 analysis, namely that the\nlower courts somehow lost sight of the forest for the trees.\nIn the majority\u2019s view, those courts\u2014as well as this dis\u00ad\nsent\u2014wrongly focused upon a subsidiary matter, \u201cincre\u00ad\nmental\u201d English-learning program \u201cfunding,\u201d rather than\nthe basic matter, whether \u201cchanges\u201d had cured, or had\ncome close to curing, the violation of federal law that\nunderlay the original judgment. Ante, at 2. In the Court\u2019s\nview, it is as if a district court, faced with a motion to\ndissolve a school desegregation decree, focused only upon\nthe school district\u2019s failure to purchase 50 decree-required\nschool buses, instead of discussing the basic question,\nwhether the schools had become integrated without need\nfor those 50 buses.\n  Thus the Court writes that the lower courts focused so\nheavily on the original decree\u2019s \u201cincremental funding\u201d\nrequirement that they failed to ask whether \u201cthe State\n4                     HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwas fulfilling its obligation under\u201d federal law \u201cby other\nmeans.\u201d Ibid. And the Court frequently criticizes the\nCourt of Appeals for having \u201cfocused almost exclusively on\nthe sufficiency of incremental funding,\u201d ante, at 15; for\n\u201cconfining the scope of its analysis to\u201d the \u201cincremental\nfunding requirement,\u201d ante, at 16; for having \u201casked only\nwhether changed circumstances affected [English\u00ad\nlearning] funding and, more specifically . . . incremental\nfunding,\u201d ante, at 17; for inquiring only \u201cinto whether the\ndeficiency in . . . incremental funding that the District\nCourt identified in 2000 had been remedied,\u201d ibid.; and (in\ncase the reader has not yet gotten the point) for \u201cfocusing\nso intensively on Arizona\u2019s incremental . . . funding,\u201d ante.,\nat 18. The Court adds that the District Court too was\nwrong to have \u201casked only whether petitioners had satis\u00ad\nfied the original declaratory judgment order through\nincreased incremental funding.\u201d Ante, at 19.\n   The problem with this basic criticism is that the State\u2019s\nprovision of adequate resources to its English-learning\nstudents, i.e., what the Court refers to as \u201cincremental\nfunding,\u201d has always been the basic contested issue in this\ncase. That is why the lower courts continuously focused\nattention directly upon it. In the context of this case they\nlooked directly at the forest, not the trees. To return to\nthe school desegregation example, the court focused upon\nthe heart of the matter, the degree of integration, and not\nupon the number of buses the school district had pur\u00ad\nchased. A description of the statutory context and the\nhistory of this case makes clear that the Court cannot\nsensibly drive a wedge (as it wishes to do) between what it\ncalls the \u201cincremental funding\u201d issue and the uncured\nfailure to comply with the requirements of federal law.\n                              1\n  The lawsuit filed in this case charged a violation of\nsubsection (f) of \u00a7204 of the Equal Educational Opportuni\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

First, the court should\n\u201cascertain\u201d whether the school system, in respect to stu\u00ad\ndents who are not yet proficient in English, \u201cis pursuing\u201d\nan English-learning program that is \u201cinformed by an\neducational theory recognized as sound by some experts in\nthe field or, at least, deemed a legitimate experimental\nstrategy.\u201d Ibid. Second, that court should determine\n\u201cwhether the programs and practices actually used by\n[the] school system are reasonably calculated to imple\u00ad\nment effectively the educational theory adopted by the\nschool,\u201d which is to say that the school system must \u201cfol\u00ad\nlow through with practices, resources and personnel neces\u00ad\nsary to transform\u201d its chosen educational theory \u201cinto\nreality.\u201d Id., at 1010 (emphasis added). Third, if prac\u00ad\ntices, resources, and personnel are adequate, the court\nshould go on to ascertain whether there is some indication\nthat the programs produce \u201cresults,\u201d i.e., that \u201cthe lan\u00ad\nguage barriers confronting students are actually being\novercome.\u201d Ibid.\n   Courts in other Circuits have followed Castaneda\u2019s\napproach.

In 1992, they\nfiled the present lawsuit against the State of Arizona, its\nBoard of Education, and the superintendent, claiming that\nthe State had violated subsection (f), not by failing to\nadopt proper English-learning programs, but by failing \u201cto\nprovide financial and other resources necessary\u201d to make\nthose programs a practical reality for Spanish-speaking\nstudents. App. 7, \u00b620 (emphasis added); see Castaneda,\nsupra, at 1010 (second, i.e., \u201cresource,\u201d requirement). In\nparticular, they said, \u201c[t]he cost\u201d of programs that would\nallow those students to learn effectively, say, to read\nEnglish at a proficient level, \u201cfar exceeds the only financial\nassistance the State theoretically provides.\u201d App. 7,\n\u00b620(a).\n   The students sought a declaration that the State had\n\u201csystematically . . . failed or refused to provide fiscal as\nwell as other resources sufficient to enable\u201d the Nogales\nSchool District and other \u201csimilarly situated [school] dis\u00ad\ntricts\u201d to \u201cestablish and maintain\u201d successful programs for\nEnglish learners. Id., at 10, \u00b628. And they sought an\nappropriate injunction requiring the provision of such\nresources. The state defendants answered the com\u00ad\nplaint. And after resolving disagreements on various\nsubsidiary issues, see id., at 19\u201330, the parties proceeded\nto trial on the remaining disputed issue in the case,\nnamely whether the State and its education authorities\n\u201cadequately fund and oversee\u201d their English-learning\nprogram. 172 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1226 (Ariz. 2000) (empha\u00ad\nsis added).\n   In January 2000, after a three-day bench trial, the\n8                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court made 64 specific factual findings, including\nthe following:\n  (1) The State assumes that its school districts need (and\nwill obtain from local and statewide sources) funding\nequal to a designated \u201cbase level amount\u201d per child\u2014\nreflecting the funding required to educate a \u201ctypical\u201d\nstudent, 516 F. 3d 1140, 1147 (CA9 2008)\u2014along with an\nadditional amount needed to educate each child with\nspecial educational needs, including those children who\nare not yet proficient in English. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1227\u20131228.\n  (2) In the year 2000, the \u201cbase level amount\u201d the State\nassumed necessary to educate a typical child amounted to\nroughly $3,174 (in year 2000 dollars). Id., at 1227.\n  (3) A cost study conducted by the State in 1988 showed\nthat, at that time, English-learning programming cost\nschool districts an additional $424 per English-learning\nchild. Id., at 1228. Adjusted for inflation to the year 2000,\nthe extra cost per student of the State\u2019s English-learning\nprogram was $617 per English-learning child.\n  (4) In the year 2000, the State\u2019s funding formula pro\u00ad\nvided school districts with only $150 to pay for the $617 in\nextra costs per child that the State assumed were needed\nto pay for its English-learning program. Id., at 1229.\n  The record contains no suggestion that Nogales, or any\nother school district, could readily turn anywhere but to\nthe State to find the $467 per-student difference between\nthe amount the State assumed was needed and the\namount that it made available. See id., at 1230. Nor does\nthe record contain any suggestion that Nogales or any\nother school district could have covered additional costs by\nredistributing \u201cbase level,\u201d typical-child funding it re\u00ad\nceived.

Ibid. Hence, the State had failed to take \u201cappro\u00ad\npriate action\u201d to teach English to non-English-speaking\nstudents, in that it had failed (in Castaneda\u2019s words) to\nprovide the \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel\u201d necessary\nto make its chosen educational theory a \u201creality.\u201d Id., at\n1238\u20131239; see also \u00a71703(f); Castaneda, 648 F. 2d, at\n1010.\n   The District Court consequently entered judgment in\nthe students\u2019 favor.

Supp. 2d\n1112, 1120 (Ariz. 2005).\n   In early 2006, the state legislature began to consider HB\n2064, a bill that, among other things, provided for the\ncreation of a \u201cTask Force\u201d charged to develop \u201ccost\u00ad\nefficient\u201d methods for teaching English. The bill would\nalso increase the appropriation for teaching English to\nstudents who needed to learn it (though it prohibited the\nspending of any increase upon any particular student for\nmore than two years). In March 2006, the petitioners here\n(the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, the\nPresident of Arizona\u2019s Senate, and the Speaker of its\nHouse of Representatives) asked the District Court (1) to\nconsider whether HB 2064, as enacted, would satisfy its\njudgment and injunctive orders, (2) to forgive the con\u00ad\ntempt fine liability that the State had accrued, and (3) to\ndissolve the injunctive orders and grant relief from the\n2000 judgment.

In August 2006, the\nCourt of Appeals ordered the District Court to decide that\nmotion, and, in particular, to consider whether changes to\n\u201cthe landscape of educational funding . . . required modifi\u00ad\ncation of the original court order or otherwise had a bear\u00ad\ning on the appropriate remedy.\u201d 204 Fed. Appx. 580, 582\n(CA9 2006) (memorandum).\n   In January 2007, the District Court held a hearing that\nlasted eight days and produced an evidentiary transcript\nof 1,684 pages. The hearing focused on the changes that\nthe petitioners said had occurred and justified setting\naside the original judgment. The petitioners pointed to\nthree sets of changed circumstances\u2014all related to \u201cprac\u00ad\ntices, resources, and personnel\u201d\u2014which, in their view,\nshowed that the judgment and the related orders were no\nlonger necessary. They argued that the changes had\nbrought the State into compliance with the Act\u2019s require\u00ad\nments. The three sets of changes consisted of (1) increases\nin the amount of funding available to Arizona school dis\u00ad\ntricts; (2) changes in the method of English-learning in\u00ad\nstruction; and (3) changes in the administration of the\nNogales school district. These changes, the petitioners\nsaid, had cured the resource-linked deficiencies that were\nnoted in the District Court\u2019s 2000 judgment, 172 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1239, and rendered enforcement of the judgment\nand related orders unnecessary.\n   Based on the hearing and the briefs, the District Court\n12                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nagain found that HB 2064 by itself did not cure the \u201cre-\nsource\u201d problem; it found that all of the changes, resource-\nrelated and otherwise, including the new teaching and\nadministrative methods, taken together, were not suffi-\ncient to warrant setting aside the judgment or the injunc-\ntive orders; and it denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion for\nrelief. 480 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1164\u20131167 (Ariz. 2007). The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusions,\nsetting forth its reasons, as I have said, in a lengthy and\ndetailed opinion. The state superintendent, along with the\nSpeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and the\nPresident of the Arizona Senate, sought certiorari, and we\ngranted the petition.\n                              B\n   Five conclusions follow from the description of the case I\nhave just set forth. First, the Rule 60(b)(5) \u201cchanges\u201d upon\nwhich the District Court focused included the \u201cchanged\nteaching methods\u201d and the \u201cchanged administrative sys-\ntems\u201d that the Court criticizes the District Court for ignor-\ning. Compare ante, at 23\u201325, 29\u201331, with Parts III\u2013A, III\u2013\nC, infra. Those changes were, in the petitioners\u2019 view,\nrelated to the \u201cfunding\u201d issue, for those changes reduced\nthe need for increased funding. See Motion to Purge, p. 7.\nI concede that the majority of the District Court\u2019s factual\nfindings focused on funding, see ante, at 20. But where is\nthe legal error, given that the opinion clearly shows that\nthe District Court considered, \u201c \u2018focus[ed]\u2019 \u201d upon, and\nwrote about all the matters petitioners raised? Ibid.; 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1160\u20131161.\n   Second, the District Court and the Court of Appeals\nfocused more heavily upon \u201cincremental funding\u201d costs,\nsee ante, at 15\u201320, for the reason that the State\u2019s provision\nfor those costs\u2014i.e., its provision of the resources neces-\nsary to run an adequate English-learning program\u2014was\nthe basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

That is, the sole subsec\u00ad\ntion (f) dispute in the case originally was whether the\nState provides the \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary\u201d to implement its English-learning program.\nCastaneda, 648 F. 2d, at 1010. To be sure, as the Court\npoints out, changes other than to the State\u2019s funding\nsystem could demonstrate that Nogales was receiving the\nnecessary resources. See, e.g., ante, at 23\u201325. But given\nthe centrality of \u201cresources\u201d to the case, it is hardly sur\u00ad\nprising that the courts below scrutinized the State\u2019s provi\u00ad\nsion of \u201cincremental funding,\u201d but without ignoring the\nother related changes to which petitioners pointed, such as\nchanges in teaching methods and administration (all of\nwhich the District Court rejected as insufficient). See Part\nIII, infra.\n   Third, the type of issue upon which the District Court\nand Court of Appeals focused lies at the heart of the statu\u00ad\ntory demand for equal educational opportunity. A State\u2019s\nfailure to provide the \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary\u201d to eliminate the educational burden that ac\u00ad\ncompanies a child\u2019s inability to speak English is precisely\nwhat the statute forbids. See Castaneda, supra, at 1010\n(emphasizing the importance of providing \u201cresources\u201d);\nNixon Address 593 (referring to the importance of provid\u00ad\ning \u201cfinancial support\u201d). And no one in this case suggests\nthere is no need for those resources, e.g., that there are no\nextra costs associated with English-learning education\nirrespective of the teaching method used.            English\u00ad\nlearning students, after all, not only require the instruc\u00ad\ntion in \u201cacademic content areas\u201d like math and science\nthat \u201ctypical\u201d students require, but they also need to\nincrease their proficiency in speaking, reading, and writ\u00ad\ning English.

Fin. & Pol\u2019y 90,\n100 (2008) (estimating that English-learning students\nrequire 74% more resources than typical students).

Supp. 2d, at 1161.\n   Fourth, the \u201cresource\u201d issue that the District Court\nfocused upon when it decided the Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\nand the statutory subsection (f) issue that lies at the heart\nof the court\u2019s original judgment (and the plaintiffs\u2019 original\ncomplaint) are not different issues, as the Court claims.\nSee ante, at 21\u201322. Rather in all essential respects they\nare one and the same issue. In focusing upon the one, the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon\nthe other. For all practical purposes, changes that would\nhave proved sufficient to show the statutory violation\ncured would have proved sufficient to warrant setting\naside the original judgment and decrees, and vice versa.\nAnd in context, judges and parties alike were fully aware\nof the modification/violation relationship. See, e.g., Inter\u00ad\nvenor-Defendants\u2019 Closing Argument Memorandum, No.\nCV\u201392\u2013596\u2013TUC\u2013RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt.

S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   To say, as the Court does, that \u201c[f]unding is merely one\ntool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objec\u00ad\ntive,\u201d ante, at 22, while true, is beside the point. Of\ncourse, a State might violate the Act in other ways. But\none way in which a State can violate the Act is to fail to\nprovide necessary \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel.\u201d\nAnd that is the way the District Court found that the\nState had violated the Act here. Thus, whatever might be\ntrue of some other case, in this case the failure to provide\nadequate resources and the underlying subsection (f)\nviolation were one and the same thing.\n   Fifth, the Court is wrong when it suggests that the\nDistrict Court ordered \u201cincreased incremental funding,\u201d\nante, at 19; when it faults the District Court for effectively\n\u201cdictating state or local budget priorities,\u201d ante, at 11;\nwhen it claims that state officials welcomed the result \u201cas\na means of achieving appropriations objectives,\u201d ante, at\n10, n. 3; and when it implies that the District Court\u2019s\norders required the State to provide a \u201cparticular level of\nfunding,\u201d ante, at 33. The District Court ordered the State\nto produce a plan that set forth a \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cra\u00ad\ntional\u201d relationship between the needs of English-learning\nstudents and the resources provided to them. The orders\nexpressed no view about what kind of English-learning\nprogram the State should use. Nor did the orders say\nanything about the amount of \u201cappropriations\u201d that the\nState must provide, ante, at 10, n. 3, or about any \u201cparticu\u00ad\nlar funding mechanism,\u201d ante, at 18, that the State was\nobligated to create. Rather, the District Court left it up to\nthe State \u201cto recommend [to the legislature] the level of\nfunding necessary to support the programs that it deter\u00ad\nmined to be the most effective.\u201d 160 F. Supp. 2d, at 1044.\nIt ordered no more than that the State (whatever kind of\nprogram it decided to use) must see that the chosen pro\u00ad\ngram benefits from a funding system that is not \u201carbitrary\nand capricious,\u201d but instead \u201cbear[s] a rational relation\u00ad\n16                   HORNE v.

Thus\nthe Court\u2019s basic criticism of the lower court decisions is\nwithout foundation. I turn next to the Court\u2019s discussion\nof the standards of review the Court finds applicable to\n\u201cinstitutional reform\u201d litigation.\n   To understand my concern about the Court\u2019s discussion\nof standards, it is important to keep in mind the well\u00ad\nknown standards that ordinarily govern the evaluation of\nRule 60(b)(5) motions. The Rule by its terms permits\nmodification of a judgment or order (1) when \u201cthe judg\u00ad\nment has been satisfied,\u201d (2) \u201creleased,\u201d or (3) \u201cdis\u00ad\ncharged;\u201d when the judgment or order (4) \u201cis based on an\nearlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated;\u201d or (5)\n\u201capplying [the judgment] prospectively is no longer equi\u00ad\ntable.\u201d No one can claim that the second, third, or fourth\ngrounds are applicable here. The relevant judgment and\norders have not been released or discharged; nor is there\nany relevant earlier judgment that has been reversed or\nvacated. Thus the only Rule 60(b)(5) questions are\nwhether the judgment and orders have been satisfied, or,\nif not, whether their continued application is \u201cequitable.\u201d\nAnd, as I have explained, in context these come down to\nthe same question: Is continued enforcement inequitable\nbecause the defendants have satisfied the 2000 declara\u00ad\ntory judgment or at least have come close to doing so, and,\ngiven that degree of satisfaction, would it work unneces\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

See supra,\nat 14.\n  To show sufficient inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief, a party must show that \u201ca significant change either\nin factual conditions or in law\u201d renders continued en\u00ad\nforcement of the judgment or order \u201cdetrimental to the\npublic interest.\u201d Rufo, 502 U. S., at 384. The party can\nclaim that \u201cthe statutory or decisional law has changed to\nmake legal what the decree was designed to prevent.\u201d Id.,\nat 388; see also Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S.\n642, 651 (1961). Or the party can claim that relevant facts\nhave changed to the point where continued enforcement of\nthe judgment, order, or decree as written would work, say,\ndisproportionately serious harm. See Rufo, supra, at 384\n(modification may be appropriate when changed circum\u00ad\nstances make enforcement \u201csubstantially more onerous\u201d or\n\u201cunworkable because of unforeseen obstacles\u201d).\n  The Court acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that Rufo\u2019s \u201cflexible standard\u201d for relief applies.\nThe Court also acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that this \u201cflexible standard\u201d does not itself define\nthe inquiry a court passing on a Rule 60(b)(5) motion must\nmake. To give content to this standard, the Court refers to\nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977), in which\nthis Court said that a decree cannot seek to \u201celiminat[e] a\ncondition that does not violate\u201d federal law or \u201cflow from\nsuch a violation,\u201d ante, at 13, and to Frew v. Hawkins, 540\nU. S. 431, 441 (2004), in which this Court said that a\n\u201cconsent decree\u201d must be \u201climited to reasonable and neces\u00ad\nsary implementations of federal law\u201d (emphasis added;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Ante, at 13.

If not\u2014i.e., if a current\nviolation of federal law cannot be detected\u2014then \u201c \u2018respon\u00ad\nsibility for discharging the State\u2019s obligations [must be]\nreturned promptly to the State.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 15.\n   One problem with the Court\u2019s discussion of its standards\nis that insofar as the considerations it mentions are widely\naccepted, the lower courts fully acknowledged and fol\u00ad\nlowed them. The decisions below, like most Rule 60(b)(5)\ndecisions, reflect the basic factors the Court mentions.\nThe lower court opinions indicate an awareness of the fact\nthat equitable decrees are subject to a \u201cflexible standard\u201d\npermitting modification when circumstances, factual or\nlegal, change significantly.      516 F. 3d, at 1163; 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (citing Rufo, supra, at 383). The\nDistrict Court\u2019s application of Castaneda\u2019s interpretation\nof subsection (f), 648 F. 2d, at 1009, along with its efforts\nto provide state officials wide discretionary authority\n(about the level of funding and the kind of funding plan),\nshow considerable sensitivity to \u201cfederalism concerns.\u201d\nAnd given the many years (at least seven) of state non\u00ad\ncompliance, it is difficult to see how the decree can have\nremained in place too long.\n   Nor is the decree at issue here a \u201cconsent decree\u201d as that\nterm is normally understood in the institutional litigation\ncontext. See ante, at 10\u201313. The State did consent to a\nfew peripheral matters that have nothing to do with the\npresent appeal. App. 19\u201330.

The State pre\u00ad\nsented proofs and evidence to the District Court designed\nto show that no violation of federal law had occurred, and\nit opposed entry of the original judgment and every subse\u00ad\nquent injunctive order, save the relief sought by petition\u00ad\ners here. I can find no evidence, beyond the Court\u2019s specu\u00ad\nlation, showing that some state officials have \u201cwelcomed\u201d\nthe District Court\u2019s decision \u201cas a means of achieving\nappropriations objectives that could not [otherwise] be\nachieved.\u201d Ante, at 10, n. 3. But even were that so, why\nwould such a fact matter here more than in any other case\nin which some state employees believe a litigant who sues\nthe State is right? I concede that the State did not appeal\nthe District Court\u2019s original order or the ensuing injunc\u00ad\ntions. But the fact that litigants refrain from appealing\ndoes not turn a litigated judgment into a \u201cconsent decree.\u201d\nAt least, I have never before heard that term so used.\n   Regardless, the Court\u2019s discussion of standards raises a\nfar more serious problem. In addition to the standards I\nhave discussed, supra, at 16\u201317, our precedents recognize\nother, here outcome-determinative, hornbook principles\nthat apply when a court evaluates a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.\nThe Court omits some of them. It mentions but fails to\napply others. As a result, I am uncertain, and perhaps\nothers will be uncertain, whether the Court has set forth a\ncorrect and workable method for analyzing a Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion.\n   First, a basic principle of law that the Court does not\nmention\u2014a principle applicable in this case as in others\u2014\nis that, in the absence of special circumstances (e.g., plain\nerror), a judge need not consider issues or factors that the\nparties themselves do not raise. That principle of law is\nlongstanding, it is reflected in Blackstone, and it perhaps\ncomes from yet an earlier age. 3 Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 455 (1768) (\u201c[I]t is a practice unknown to\nour law\u201d when examining the decree of an inferior court,\n20                    HORNE v.

As we have recognized, it would be difficult to\noperate an adversary system of justice without applying\nsuch a principle. See Duignan v. United States, 274 U. S.\n195, 200 (1927). But the majority repeatedly considers\nprecisely such claims. See, e.g., ante, at 26\u201329 (consider\u00ad\ning significant matters not raised below); ante, at 34\u201336\n(same).\n   Second, a hornbook Rule 60(b)(5) principle, which the\nCourt mentions, ante, at 10, is that the party seeking\nrelief from a judgment or order \u201cbears the burden of estab\u00ad\nlishing that a significant change in circumstances war\u00ad\nrants\u201d that relief. Rufo, 502 U. S., at 383 (emphasis\nadded); cf. Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools\nv. Dowell, 498 U.

Cf.\nRufo, supra, at 389, n. 12 (emphasizing that \u201cwe do not\nhave before us the question whether the entire decree\nshould be vacated\u201d). Courts normally do the latter only if\nthe \u201cparty\u201d seeking \u201cto have\u201d the \u201cdecree set aside en\u00ad\ntirely\u201d shows \u201cthat the decree has served its purpose, and\nthere is no longer any need for the injunction.\u201d 12 J.\nMoore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a760.47 [2][c] (3d ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Moore). Instead of applying the distinc\u00ad\ntion, the majority says that the Court of Appeals \u201cstrayed\u201d\nwhen it referred to situations in which changes justified\nsetting an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside as \u201c \u2018likely\nrare.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 14.\n   Fourth, the Court says nothing about the well\u00ad\nestablished principle that a party moving under Rule\n60(b)(5) for relief that amounts to having a \u201cdecree set\naside entirely\u201d must show both (1) that the decree\u2019s objects\nhave been \u201cattained,\u201d Frew, 540 U. S., at 442, and (2) that\nit is unlikely, in the absence of the decree, that the unlaw\u00ad\nful acts it prohibited will again occur. This Court so held\nin Dowell, a case in which state defendants sought relief\nfrom a school desegregation decree on the ground that the\ndistrict was presently operating in compliance with the\nEqual Protection Clause. The Court agreed with the\ndefendants that \u201ca finding by the District Court that the\nOklahoma City School District was being operated in\ncompliance with . . . the Equal Protection Clause\u201d was\nindeed relevant to the question whether relief was appro\u00ad\npriate. 498 U. S., at 247. But the Court added that, to\nshow entitlement to relief, the defendants must also show\nthat \u201cit was unlikely that the [school board] would return\nto its former ways.\u201d Ibid. Only then would the \u201cpurposes\nof the desegregation litigation ha[ve] been fully achieved.\u201d\nIbid.

FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich they pointed were sufficient to warrant entirely\nsetting aside the original court judgment.\n   Fifth, the majority mentions, but fails to apply, the basic\nRule 60(b)(5) principle that a party cannot dispute the\nlegal conclusions of the judgment from which relief is\nsought. A party cannot use a Rule 60(b)(5) motion as a\nsubstitute for an appeal, say, by attacking the legal rea\u00ad\nsoning underlying the original judgment or by trying to\nshow that the facts, as they were originally, did not then\njustify the order\u2019s issuance. Browder v. Director, Dept. of\nCorrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978); United\nStates v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 119 (1932) (party\ncannot claim that injunction could not lawfully have been\napplied \u201cto the conditions that existed at its making\u201d).\nNor can a party require a court to retrace old legal ground,\nsay, by re-making or rejustifying its original \u201cconstitu\u00ad\ntional decision every time an effort [is] made to enforce or\nmodify\u201d an order. Rufo, supra, at 389\u2013390 (internal quo\u00ad\ntation marks omitted); see also Frew, supra, at 438 (reject\u00ad\ning argument that federal court lacks power to enforce an\norder \u201cunless the court first identifies, at the enforcement\nstage, a violation of federal law\u201d).\n   Here, the original judgment rested upon a finding that\nthe State had failed to provide Nogales with adequate\nfunding \u201cresources,\u201d Castaneda, 648 F. 2d, at 1010, in\nviolation of subsection (f)\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d require\u00ad\nment. How then can the Court fault the lower courts for\nfirst and foremost seeking to determine whether Arizona\nhad developed a plan that would provide Nogales with\nadequate funding resources?

Railway Employees, 364 U.

See\nBrowder, supra, at 263, n. 7; Railway Employees, supra, at\n648\u2013650. A reviewing court must not substitute its judg\u00ad\nment for that of the district court. See National Hockey\nLeague v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U. S. 639,\n642 (1976) (per curiam); see also Calderon v. Thompson,\n523 U. S. 538, 567\u2013568 (1998) (SOUTER, J., dissenting)\n(\u201c[A] high degree of deference to the court exercising dis\u00ad\ncretionary authority is the hallmark of [abuse of discre\u00ad\ntion] review\u201d). Particularly where, as here, entitlement to\nrelief depends heavily upon fact-related determinations,\nthe power to review the district court\u2019s decision \u201cought\nseldom to be called into action,\u201d namely only in the rare\ninstance where the Rule 60(b) standard \u201cappears to have\nbeen misapprehended or grossly misapplied.\u201d Cf. Univer\u00ad\nsal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 490\u2013491 (1951).\nThe Court\u2019s bare assertion that a court abuses its discre\u00ad\ntion when it fails to order warranted relief, ante, at 10,\nfails to account for the deference due to the District\nCourt\u2019s decision.\n   I have just described Rule 60(b)(5) standards that con\u00ad\ncern (1) the obligation (or lack of obligation) upon a court\nto take account of considerations the parties do not raise;\n24                     HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(2) burdens of proof; (3) the distinction between setting\naside and modifying a judgment; (4) the need to show that\na decree\u2019s basic objectives have been attained; (5) the\nimportance of not requiring relitigation of previously\nlitigated matters; and (6) abuse of discretion review. Does\nthe Court intend to ignore one or more of these standards\nor to apply them differently in cases involving what it calls\n\u201cinstitutional reform litigation\u201d?\n   If so, the Court will find no support for its approach in\nthe cases to which it refers, namely Rufo, Milliken, and\nFrew. Rufo involved a motion to modify a complex court\u00ad\nmonitor-supervised decree designed to prevent overcrowd\u00ad\ning in a local jail. The Court stressed the fact that the\nmodification did not involve setting aside the entire de\u00ad\ncree. 502 U. S., at 389, n. 12. It made clear that the party\nseeking relief from an institutional injunction \u201cbears the\nburden of establishing that a significant change in circum\u00ad\nstances warrants\u201d that relief. Id., at 383. And it rejected\nthe argument that a reviewing court must determine, in\nevery case, whether an ongoing violation of federal law\nexists. Id., at 389, 390, and n. 12 (refusing to require a\nnew \u201c \u2018constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made\nto enforce or modify\u2019 \u201d a judgment or decree (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Frew addressed the question whether the Eleventh\nAmendment permits a federal district court to enforce a\nconsent decree against state officials seeking to bring the\nState into compliance with federal law. 540 U. S., at 434\u2013\n435. The Court unanimously held that it does; and in\ndoing so, the Court rejected the State\u2019s alternative argu\u00ad\nment that a federal court may only enforce such an order\nif it \u201cfirst identifies . . . a violation of federal law\u201d existing\nat the time that enforcement is sought. Id., at 438.\nRather, the Court explained that \u201c \u2018federal courts are not\nreduced to\u2019 \u201d entering judgments or orders \u201c \u2018and hoping for\ncompliance,\u2019 \u201d id., at 440, but rather retain the power to\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

It also emphasized,\nlike Dowell, that relief is warranted only when \u201cthe objects\nof the decree have been attained.\u201d 540 U. S., at 442.\n   What of Milliken? Milliken involved direct review\n(rather than a motion for relief) of a district court\u2019s order\nrequiring the Detroit school system to implement a host of\nremedial programs, including counseling and special\nreading instruction, aimed at schoolchildren previously\nrequired to attend segregated schools. 433 U. S., at 269,\n272. The Court said that a court decree must aim at\n\u201celiminating a condition\u201d that violates federal law or\nwhich \u201cflow[s] from\u201d such a \u201cviolation.\u201d Id., at 282. And it\nunanimously found that the remedy at issue was lawful.\n   These cases confirm the unfortunate fact that the Court\nhas failed fully to apply the six essential principles that I\nhave mentioned. If the Court does not intend any such\nmodifications of these traditional standards, then, as I\nshall show, it must affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\nBut if it does intend to modify them, as stated or in appli\u00ad\ncation, it now applies a new set of new rules that are not\nfaithful to our cases and which will create the dangerous\npossibility that orders, judgments, and decrees long final\nor acquiesced in, will be unwarrantedly subject to perpet\u00ad\nual challenge, offering defendants unjustifiable opportuni\u00ad\nties endlessly to relitigate underlying violations with the\nburden of proof imposed once again upon the plaintiffs.\n   I recognize that the Court\u2019s decision, to a degree, reflects\none side of a scholarly debate about how courts should\nproperly handle decrees in \u201cinstitutional reform litiga\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Compare, in general, R. Sandler & D. Schoenbrod,\nDemocracy by Decree: What Happens When Courts Run\nGovernment (2003), with, e.g., Chayes, The Role of the\nJudge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281,\n1307\u20131309 (1976). But whatever the merits of that de\u00ad\nbate, this case does not involve the kind of \u201cinstitutional\n26                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlitigation\u201d that most commonly lies at its heart. See, e.g.,\nM. Feeley & E. Rubin, Judicial Policy Making and the\nModern State: How the Courts Reformed America\u2019s Pris\u00ad\nons (1998); but see ante, at 10, n. 3.\n   The case does not involve schools, prisons, or mental\nhospitals that have failed to meet basic constitutional\nstandards. See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U. S., at 240\u2013241. It\ndoes not involve a comprehensive judicial decree that\ngoverns the running of a major institution. See, e.g.,\nHutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 683\u2013684 (1978). It does\nnot involve a highly detailed set of orders. See, e.g.,\nRamos v. Lamm, 639 F. 2d 559, 585\u2013586 (CA10 1980). It\ndoes not involve a special master charged with the task of\nsupervising a complex decree that will gradually bring a\nlarge institution into compliance with the law. See, e.g.,\nRuiz v. Estelle, 679 F. 2d 1115, 1160\u20131161 (CA5 1982).\nRather, it involves the more common complaint that a\nstate or local government has failed to meet a federal\nstatutory requirement. See, e.g., Concilio de Salud Inte\u00ad\ngral de Loiza, Inc. v. P\u00e9rez-Perdomo, 551 F. 3d 10, 16 (CA1\n2008); Association of Community Orgs. for Reform Now v.\nEdgar, 56 F. 3d 791, 797\u2013798 (CA7 1995); John B. v.\nMenke, 176 F. Supp. 2d 786, 813\u2013814 (MD Tenn. 2001). It\ninvolves a court imposition of a fine upon the State due to\nits lengthy failure to take steps to comply. See, e.g., Hook\nv. Arizona Dept. of Corrections, 107 F. 3d 1397, 1404 (CA9\n1997); Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F. 3d 1347, 1360 (CA5\n1995). And it involves court orders that leave the State\nfree to pursue the English-learning program of its choice\nwhile insisting only that the State come up with a funding\nplan that is rationally related to the program it chooses.\nThis case is more closely akin to Goldberg v. Kelly, 397\nU. S. 254 (1970) (in effect requiring legislation to fund\nwelfare-related \u201cdue process\u201d hearings); cf. id., at 277\u2013279\n(Black, J., dissenting), than it is to the school busing cases\nthat followed Brown v.

Supp. 2d, at 1165. In\nthe opinions below, I can find no misapplication of the\nlegal standards relevant to this case. To the contrary, the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 opinion is true to the record and fair to\nthe decision of the District Court. And the majority is\nwrong to conclude otherwise.\n                             III\n   If the Court\u2019s criticism of the lower courts cannot rest\nupon what they did do, namely examine directly whether\nArizona had produced a rational funding program, it must\nrest upon what it believes they did not do, namely ade\u00ad\nquately consider the other changes in English-learning\ninstruction, administration, and the like to which petition\u00ad\ners referred. Indeed, the Court must believe this, for it\norders the lower courts, on remand, to conduct a \u201cproper\nexamination\u201d of \u201cfour important factual and legal changes\nthat may warrant the granting of relief from the judg\u00ad\nment:\u201d (1) the \u201cadoption of a new . . . instructional meth\u00ad\nodology\u201d for teaching English; (2) \u201cCongress\u2019 enactment\u201d of\nthe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.

FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfor the view that\u201d structured English immersion \u201cis sig\u00ad\nnificantly more effective than bilingual education.\u201d Ante,\nat 24.\n   It is difficult to see how the majority can substitute its\njudgment for the District Court\u2019s judgment on this ques\u00ad\ntion, however, for that judgment includes a host of sub\u00ad\nsidiary fact-related determinations that warrant defer\u00ad\nence. Railway Employees, 364 U. S., at 647\u2013648 (\u201cWhere\nthere is . . . a balance of imponderables there must be\nwide discretion in the District Court\u201d). And, despite con\u00ad\nsiderable evidence showing improvement, there was also\nconsiderable evidence the other way, evidence that sup\u00ad\nported the District Court\u2019s view that it would be \u201cprema\u00ad\nture\u201d to set aside the judgment of violation.\n   The methodological change was introduced in Arizona in\nlate 2000, and in Nogales it was a work in progress, \u201c[t]o\none degree or another,\u201d as of June 2005. Tr. 10 (Jan. 12,\n2007); ante, at 25. As of 2006, the State\u2019s newest struc\u00ad\ntured English immersion models had not yet taken effect.\nTr. 138 (Jan. 17, 2007) (\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to hopefully\nput down some models for districts to choose from\u201d). The\nState had adopted its new assessment test only the previ\u00ad\nous year. App. 164\u2013165. The testimony about the extent\nto which Nogales had adopted the new teaching system\nwas unclear and conflicting. Compare Tr. 96 (Jan. 9,\n2007) with Tr. 10 (Jan. 12, 2007). And, most importantly,\nthere was evidence that the optimistic improvement in the\nnumber of students completing the English-learning pro\u00ad\ngram was considerably overstated. See Tr. 37 (Jan. 18,\n2007) (stating that the assessment test used in 2005 and\n2006, when dramatic improvements had been reported,\nwas significantly less \u201crigorous\u201d and consequently had\nbeen replaced). The State\u2019s own witnesses were unable\nfirmly to conclude that the new system had so far pro\u00ad\nduced significantly improved results. Tr. 112\u2013113 (Jan.\n11, 2007) (stating that \u201cat some point\u201d it would be possible\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Given the underlying\nfactual disputes (about, e.g., the reliability of the testing\nmethod), how can this Court now hold that the District\nCourt, and the appellate court that affirmed its conclu\u00ad\nsions, were legally wrong?\n                              B\n   The second change that the Court says the lower courts\nshould properly \u201cexamine\u201d is the \u201cenactment\u201d of the No\nChild Left Behind Act. Ante, at 25. The Court concedes,\nhowever, that both courts did address the only argument\nabout that \u201cenactment\u201d that the petitioners made, namely,\nthat \u201ccompliance\u201d with that new law automatically consti\u00ad\ntutes compliance with subsection (f)\u2019s \u201c \u2018appropriate ac\u00ad\ntion\u2019 \u201d requirement. Ante, at 26; see also, e.g., App. 73\n(arguing that the new law \u201cpreempts\u201d subsection (f)). And\nthe Court today agrees (as do I) that the lower courts\nproperly rejected that argument. Ante, at 26.\n   Instead, the Court suggests that the lower courts\nwrongly failed to take account of four other ways in which\nthe new Act is \u201cprobative,\u201d namely (1) its prompting \u201csig\u00ad\nnificant structural and programming\u201d changes, (2) its\nincreases in \u201cfederal funding,\u201d (3) \u201cits assessment and\nreporting requirements,\u201d and (4) its \u201cshift in federal edu\u00ad\ncation policy.\u201d Ante, at 26\u201328. In fact, the lower courts\ndid take account of the changes in structure, program\u00ad\nming, and funding (including federal funding) relevant to\nthe English-learning program in Nogales and elsewhere in\nthe State. See Part III\u2013A, supra; Parts III\u2013C and III\u2013D,\ninfra. But, I agree with the Court that the District Court\ndid not explicitly relate its discussion to the new Act nor\n32                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndid it take account of what the majority calls a \u201cshift in\nfederal education policy.\u201d Ante, at 28.\n  The District Court failed to do what the Court now\ndemands for one simple reason. No one (with the possible\nexception of the legislators, who hint at the matter in their\nreply brief filed in this Court) has ever argued that the\nDistrict Court should take account of any such \u201cchange.\u201d\nBut see ante, at 26, and n. 12.\n  As I have explained, see supra, at 19\u201320, it is well\u00ad\nestablished that a district court rarely commits legal error\nwhen it fails to take account of a \u201cchange\u201d that no one\ncalled to its attention or fails to reply to an argument that\nno one made. See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U. S., at 249 (party\nseeking relief from judgment must make a \u201csufficient\nshowing\u201d). A district court must construe fairly the argu\u00ad\nments made to it; but it is not required to conjure up\nquestions never squarely presented. That the Court of\nAppeals referred to an argument resembling the Court\u2019s\nnew assertion does not change the underlying legal fact.\nThe District Court committed no legal error in failing to\nconsider it. The Court of Appeals could properly reach the\nsame conclusion. And the Government, referring to the\nargument here, does not ask for reversal or remand on\nthat, or on any other, basis.\n  That is not surprising, since the lower courts have con\u00ad\nsistently and explicitly held that \u201cflexibility cannot be\nused to relieve the moving party of its burden to establish\nthat\u201d dissolution is warranted. Thompson v. United States\nDept. of Housing and Urban Development, 220 F. 3d 241,\n248 (CA4 2000); Marshall v. Board of Ed., Bergenfield,\nN. J., 575 F. 2d 417, 423\u2013424 (CA3 1978). There is no\nbasis for treating this case in this respect as somehow\nexceptional, particularly since publicly available docu\u00ad\nments indicate that, in any event, Nogales is not \u201c \u2018reach\u00ad\ning its own goals under Title III\u2019 \u201d of the Act.

Again,\nthe Court cannot mean that the lower courts failed to\n\u201cexamine\u201d these arguments, for the District Court heard\nextensive evidence on the matter. The Court itself refers\nto some (but only some) of the evidence introduced on this\npoint, namely the testimony of Kelt Cooper, the former\nNogales district superintendent, who said that his admin\u00ad\nistrative policies had \u201c \u2018ameliorated or eliminated many of\nthe most glaring inadequacies\u2019 \u201d in Nogales\u2019 program. Ibid.\nThe Court also refers to the District Court\u2019s and Court of\nAppeals\u2019 conclusions about the matter. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1160 (\u201cThe success or failure of the children of\u201d Nogales\n\u201cshould not depend on\u201d \u201cone person\u201d); 516 F. 3d, at 1156\u2013\n1157 (recognizing that Nogales had achieved \u201creforms\nwith limited resources\u201d but also pointing to evidence show\u00ad\ning that \u201cthere are still significant resource constraints,\u201d\nand affirming the District Court\u2019s similar conclusion).\n   Rather the Court claims that the lower courts improp\u00ad\nerly \u201cdiscounted\u201d this evidence. Ante, at 30. But what\ndoes the Court mean by \u201cdiscount\u201d? It cannot mean that\nthe lower courts failed to take account of the possibility\nthat these changes \u201cmight have brought Nogales[\u2019]\u201d pro\u00ad\ngram into \u201ccompliance\u201d with subsection (f). After all, that\nis precisely what the petitioners below argued. Interve\u00ad\nnor-Defendants\u2019 Closing Argument Memorandum, No.\nCV\u201392\u2013596\u2013TUC\u2013RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt.

FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave given significantly more weight to the changes, i.e.,\nthe Court disagrees with the lower courts\u2019 conclusion\nabout the likely effect these changes will have on the\nsuccess of Nogales\u2019 English-learning programs (hence, on\nthe need for the judgment and orders to remain in effect).\n   It is difficult to understand the legal basis for the\nCourt\u2019s disagreement about this fact-related matter. The\nevidence before the District Court was mixed. It consisted\nof some evidence showing administrative reform and\nmanagerial improvement in Nogales. Ante, at 29\u201330. At\nthe same time other evidence, to which the Court does not\nrefer, shows that these reforms did not come close to cur\u00ad\ning the problem. The record shows, for example, that the\ngraduation rate in 2005 for English-learning students\n(59%) was significantly below the average for all students\n(75%). App. 195. It shows poor performance by English\u00ad\nlearning students, compared with English-speaking stu\u00ad\ndents, on Arizona\u2019s content-based standardized tests. See\nAppendix A, infra. This was particularly true at Nogales\u2019\nsole high school\u2014which Arizona ranked 575th out of its\n629 schools on an educational department survey, 516\nF. 3d, at 1159\u2014where only 28% of ELL students passed\nthose standardized tests. Ibid.\n   The record also contains testimony from Guillermo\nZamudio, who in 2005 succeeded Cooper as Nogales\u2019 su\u00ad\nperintendent, and who described numerous relevant \u201cre\u00ad\nsource-related\u201d deficiencies: Lack of funding meant that\nNogales had to rely upon long-term substitute and \u201cemer\u00ad\ngency certified\u201d teachers without necessary training and\nexperience. Tr. 45 (Jan. 18, 2007). Nogales needed addi\u00ad\ntional funding to hire trained teachers\u2019 aides\u2014a \u201cstrong\ncomponent\u201d of its English-learning program, id., at 47.\nAnd Nogales\u2019 funding needs forced it to pay a starting base\nsalary to its teachers about 14% below the state average,\nmaking it difficult to recruit qualified teachers. Id., at 48.\nFinally, Zamudio said that Nogales\u2019 lack of resources\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwould likely lead in the near future to the cancellation of\ncertain programs, including a remedial reading program,\nid., at 56, and would prevent the school district from\nproviding appropriate class sizes and tutoring, which he\ncharacterized as \u201cessential and necessary for us to be able\nto have our students learn English,\u201d id., at 75\u201378.\n   The District Court, faced with all this evidence, found\nthe management and structural \u201cchange\u201d insufficient to\nwarrant dissolution of its decree. How can the Court say\nthat this conclusion is unreasonable? What is the legal\nbasis for concluding that the District Court acted beyond\nthe scope of its lawful authority?\n   In fact, the Court does not even try to claim that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable. Rather it\nenigmatically says that the District Court made \u201cinsuffi\u00ad\ncient factual findings\u201d to support the conclusion that an\nongoing violation of law exists. Ante, at 31\u201332. By \u201cinsuf\u00ad\nficient,\u201d the Court does not mean nonexistent. See 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1163\u20131164. Nor can it mean that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s findings were skimpy or unreasonable.\nThat court simply drew conclusions on the basis of evi\u00ad\ndence it acknowledged was mixed. Id., at 1160\u20131161.\nWhat is wrong with those findings, particularly if viewed\nwith appropriate deference?\n   At one point the Court says that there \u201care many possi\u00ad\nble causes\u201d of Nogales\u2019 difficulties and that the lower\ncourts failed to \u201ctake into account other variables that\nmay explain\u201d the ongoing deficiencies. Ante, at 32 and\nn. 20. But to find a flaw here is to claim that the plaintiffs\nhave failed to negate the possibility that these other\ncauses, not the State\u2019s resource failures, explain Nogales\u2019\npoor performance. To say this is to ignore well-established\nlaw that accords deference to the District Court\u2019s fact\u00ad\nrelated judgments. See supra, at 22\u201323. The Court\u2019s\nstatements reflect the acknowledgment that the evidence\nbelow was mixed. Given that acknowledgment, it is clear\n36                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\nfinding that petitioners had not shown sufficient \u201cchanged\ncircumstances.\u201d And it was petitioners\u2019 job, as the moving\nparty, to show that compliance with federal law has been\nachieved. Where \u201cother variables\u201d make it difficult to\nconclude that a present violation does or does not exist,\nwhat error does the District Court commit if it concludes\nthat the moving party has failed to satisfy that burden?\n                               D\n  The fourth \u201cchange\u201d that the Court suggests the lower\ncourts did not properly \u201cexamine\u201d consists of an \u201coverall\nincrease in the education funding available in Nogales.\u201d\nAnte, at 32. Again, the Court is wrong to suggest that the\nDistrict Court failed fully to examine the matter, for de\u00ad\nspite the Court\u2019s assertions to the contrary, it made a\nnumber of \u201cup-to-date factual findings,\u201d ante, at 33, on the\nmatter, see 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161\u20131164. Those findings\nreflect that the State had developed an educational plan\nthat raised the \u201cbase level amount\u201d for the typical student\nfrom $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to $3,570 in 2006 (in con\u00ad\nstant 2006 dollars), ante, at 32, n. 21; and that plan in\u00ad\ncreased the additional (i.e., \u201cweighted\u201d) amount that would\nbe available per English-learning student from $182 to\n$349 (in 2006 dollars). The State contended that this new\nplan, with its explanation of how the money needed would\nbe forthcoming from federal, as well as from state, sources,\nmet subsection (f)\u2019s requirement for \u201cappropriate action\u201d\n(as related to \u201cresources\u201d) and the District Court\u2019s own\ninsistence upon a mechanism that rationally funded those\nresources. See Appendix B, infra.\n  Once again the Court\u2019s \u201cfactual-finding\u201d criticism seems,\nin context, to indicate its disagreement with the lower\ncourts\u2019 resolution of this argument. That is to say, the\nCourt seems to disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclu\u00ad\nsion that, even with the new funding, the State failed to\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           37\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nshow that adequate resources for English-learning pro\u00ad\ngrams would likely be forthcoming; hence the new plan\nwas not \u201crationally related\u201d to the underlying resource\nproblem.\n   The record, however, adequately supports the District\nCourt\u2019s conclusion. For one thing, the funding plan dem\u00ad\nonstrates that, in 2006, 69% of the available funding was\ntargeted at \u201cbase level\u201d education, see Appendix B, infra,\ni.e., it was funding available to provide students with basic\neducational services like instruction in mathematics,\nscience, and so forth. See Tr. 110 (Jan. 12, 2007). The\nDistrict Court found that this funding likely would not\nbecome available for English-learning programs.\n   How is that conclusion unreasonable? If these funds are\nprovided for the provision of only basic services, how can\nthe majority now decide that a school district\u2014\nparticularly a poor school district like Nogales\u2014would be\nable to cover the additional expenses associated with\nEnglish-learning education while simultaneously manag\u00ad\ning to provide for its students\u2019 basic educational needs?\nIndeed, the idea is particularly impractical when applied\nto a district like Nogales, which has a high percentage of\nstudents who need extra resources. See 516 F. 3d, at 1145\n(approximately 90% of Nogales\u2019 students were, or had\nbeen, enrolled in the English-learning program in 2006).\nWhere the vast majority of students in a district are those\nwho \u201cneed extra help\u201d which \u201ccosts extra money,\u201d it is\ndifficult to imagine where one could find an untapped\nstream of funding that could cover those additional costs.\n   For another thing, the petitioners\u2019 witnesses conceded\nthat the State had not yet determined the likely costs to\nschool districts of teaching English learners using the\nstructured English immersion method. See, e.g., Tr. 199\u2013\n200 (Jan. 17, 2007). The legislators reported that the\nState had recently asked a task force to \u201cdetermine\u201d the\nextra costs associated with implementing the structured\n38                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nEnglish immersion model. Speaker\u2019s Opening Appellate\nBrief in No. 07\u201315603 etc. (CA9), p. 31. But that task\nforce had not yet concluded its work.\n  Further, the District Court doubted that the federal\nportion of the funding identified by the petitioners would\nbe available for English-learning programs. It character\u00ad\nized certain federal grant money, included in the petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 calculus of available funds, as providing only \u201cshort\u00ad\nterm\u201d assistance, 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161. And testimony\nat the evidentiary hearing indicated that some of the\nfunds identified by petitioners might not in fact be avail\u00ad\nable to Nogales\u2019 schools. See Tr. 59\u201361 (Jan. 10, 2007). It\nalso noted that certain funds were restricted, meaning\nthat no particular English-learning child could benefit\nfrom them for more than two years\u2014despite the fact that\nEnglish-learning students in Nogales on average spend\nfour to five years in that program. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1163\u20131164 (Nogales will have to \u201cdilute\u201d the funds pro\u00ad\nvided to cover students who remain English learners for\nmore than two years).\n  Finally, the court pointed to federal law, which imposes\na restriction forbidding the State to use a large portion of\n(what the State\u2019s plan considered to be) available funds in\nthe manner the State proposed, i.e., to \u201csupplant,\u201d or\nsubstitute for, the funds the State would otherwise have\nspent on the program. Id., at 1162; see also 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a76314(a)(2)(B), 6315(b)(3), 6613(f), 6825(g). The District\nCourt concluded that the State\u2019s funding plan was in large\npart unworkable in light of this restriction. In reaching\nthis conclusion, the District Court relied in part upon the\ntestimony of Thomas Fagan, a former United States De\u00ad\npartment of Education employee and an \u201cexpert\u201d on this\ntype of federal funding. Fagan testified that Arizona\u2019s\nplan was a \u201c \u2018blatant violation\u2019 \u201d of the relevant laws, which\ncould result in a loss to the State of over $600 million in\nfederal funds\u2014including those federal funds the State\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           39\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nplan would provide for English learners. 480 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 1163.\n   The Court says that the analysis I have just described,\nand in which the court engaged, amounts to \u201cclear legal\nerror.\u201d Ante, at 33. What error? Where is the error? The\nCourt does say earlier in its opinion that the lower courts\n\u201cshould not\u201d have \u201cdisregarded\u201d the relevant federal (i.e.,\nNo Child Left Behind Act) funds \u201cjust because they are not\nstate funds.\u201d Ante, at 27. But the District Court did not\ndisregard those funds \u201cjust because they are not state\nfunds.\u201d Nor did it \u201cforeclos[e] the possibility that petition\u00ad\ners could\u201d show entitlement to relief by pointing to \u201can\noverall increase in education funding.\u201d Ante, at 33.\nRather, the District Court treated those increased funds\nas potentially unavailable, primarily because their use as\nplanned would violate federal law and would thereby\nthreaten the State with total loss of the stream of federal\nfunding it planned to use. It concluded that the State\u2019s\nplan amounted to \u201c \u2018a blatant violation\u2019 \u201d of federal law, and\nremarked that \u201cthe potential loss of federal funds is sub\u00ad\nstantial.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1163. Is there a better\nreason for \u201cdisregard[ing]\u201d those funds?\n   The Court may have other \u201cerrors\u201d in mind as well. It\ndoes say, earlier in its opinion, that some believe that\n\u201cincreased funding alone does not improve student\nachievement,\u201d ante, at 28 (emphasis added), and it refers\nto nine studies that suggest that increased funding does\nnot always help. See ante, at 28\u201331, nn. 17\u201319; see also\nBrief for Education-Policy Scholars as Amici Curiae 7\u201311\n(discussing such scholarship). I do not know what this has\nto do with the matter. But if it is relevant to today\u2019s deci\u00ad\nsion, the Court should also refer to the many studies that\ncast doubt upon the results of the studies it cites. See,\ne.g., H. Ladd & J.

Hedges & R. Laine, The Effect of\nSchool Resources on Student Achievement, 66 Rev. Educ.\nRes. 361, 362 (1996).\n  Regardless, the relation of a funding plan to improved\nperformance is not an issue for this Court to decide\nthrough footnote references to the writings of one side of a\ncomplex expert debate. The question here is whether the\nState has shown that its new funding program amounts to\na \u201cchange\u201d that satisfies subsection (f)\u2019s requirement. The\nDistrict Court found it did not. Nothing this Court says\ncasts doubt on the legal validity of that conclusion.\n                                IV\n   The Court\u2019s remaining criticisms are not well founded.\nThe Court, for example, criticizes the Court of Appeals for\nhaving referred to the \u201ccircumstances\u201d that \u201cwarrant Rule\n60(b)(5) relief as \u2018likely rare,\u2019 \u201d for having said the petition\u00ad\ners would have to \u201csweep away\u201d the District Court\u2019s \u201cfund\u00ad\ning determination\u201d in order to prevail, for having spoken\nof the \u201clandscape\u201d as not being \u201cso radically changed as to\njustify relief from judgment without compliance,\u201d and for\nhaving somewhat diminished the \u201cclose[ness]\u201d of its re\u00ad\nview for \u201cfederalism concerns\u201d because the State and its\nBoard of Education \u201cwish the injunction to remain in\nplace.\u201d Ante, at 14\u201315 (first, second, and fourth emphases\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court, however, does not explain the context in\nwhich the Court of Appeals\u2019 statements appeared. That\ncourt used its first phrase (\u201clikely rare\u201d) to refer to the\nparticular kind of modification that the State sought,\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            41\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnamely complete relief from the original judgment, even if\nthe judgment\u2019s objective was not yet fully achieved. 516\nF. 3d, at 1167; cf. Moore \u00a760.47 [2][c]. As far as I know it\nis indeed \u201crare\u201d that \u201ca prior judgment is so undermined\nby later circumstances as to render its continued enforce\u00ad\nment inequitable\u201d even though compliance with the judg\u00ad\nment\u2019s legal determination has not occurred. 516 F. 3d, at\n1167. At least, the Court does not point to other instances\nthat make it common. Uses of the word \u201csweeping\u201d and\n\u201cradica[l] change\u201d in context refer to the deference owed to\nthe District Court\u2019s 2000 legal determination. See id., at\n1168 (describing the 2000 order\u2019s \u201cbasic determination\u201d\nthat English-learning \u201cprograms require substantial state\nfunding in addition to that spent on basic educational\nprogramming\u201d). If there is an error (which I doubt, see\nsupra, at 21\u201323) the error is one of tone, not of law.\n   Nor do I see any legal error that could have made a\ndifference when the Court of Appeals said it should down\u00ad\nplay the importance of federalism concerns because some\nelements of Arizona\u2019s state government support the judg\u00ad\nment. I do not know the legal basis for the majority\u2019s\nreference to this recalibration of judicial distance as \u201cflatly\nincorrect,\u201d but, if it is wrong, I still do not see how recali\u00ad\nbrating the recalibration could matter.\n   In sum, the majority\u2019s decision to set aside the lower\ncourt decisions rests upon (1) a mistaken effort to drive a\nwedge between (a) review of funding plan changes and (b)\nreview of changes that would bring the State into compli\u00ad\nance with federal law, Part I, supra; (2) a misguided at\u00ad\ntempt to show that the lower courts applied the wrong\nlegal standards, Part II, supra; (3) a mistaken belief that\nthe lower courts made four specific fact-based errors, Part\nIII, supra; and (4) a handful of minor criticisms, Part IV,\nsupra and this page. By tracing each of these criticisms to\nits source in the record, I have tried to show that each is\nunjustified. Whether taken separately or together, they\n42                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncannot warrant setting aside the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision.\n                             V\n   As a totally separate matter, the Court says it is \u201cun\u00ad\nclear\u201d whether the District Court improperly ordered\nstatewide injunctive relief instead of confining that relief\nto Nogales. And it orders the District Court to vacate the\ninjunction \u201cinsofar as it extends beyond Nogales\u201d unless\nthe court finds that \u201cArizona is violating\u201d subsection (f)\n\u201con a statewide basis.\u201d Ante, at 36.\n   What is the legal support for this part of the majority\u2019s\nopinion? Prior to the appearance of this case in this Court,\nno one asked for that modification. Nothing in the law, as\nfar as I know, makes the relief somehow clearly erroneous.\nIndeed, as the majority recognizes, the reason that the\ninjunction runs statewide is that the State of Arizona, the\ndefendant in the litigation, asked the Court to enter that\nrelief. The State pointed in support to a state constitu\u00ad\ntional provision requiring educational uniformity. See\nante, at 35. There is no indication that anyone disputed\nwhether the injunction should have statewide scope. A\nstatewide program harmed Nogales\u2019 students, App. 13\u201314,\n\u00b6\u00b640, 42; and the State wanted statewide relief. What in\nthe law makes this relief erroneous?\n   The majority says that the District Court must consider\nthis matter because \u201c[p]etitioners made it clear at oral\nargument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated.\u201d\nAnte, at 34, n. 23. I find the matter less clear. I would\ndirect the reader to the oral argument transcript, which\nreads in part:\n     \u201cMr. Starr: What was entered here in this order,\n     which makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire\n     State funding mechanism has been interfered with by\n     the order. This case started out in Nogales.\n         .          .           .          .        .\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          43\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    \u201cJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I\u2014I agree with that. I think it\n    was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that applied\n    only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State at\u00ad\n    torney general wanted that done.\n    \u201cMr. Starr: But we should be able now to\u2014\n    \u201cJUSTICE SCALIA: But that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s water over the\n    dam. That\u2019s not what this suit is about now.\u201d Tr. of\n    Oral Arg. 26.\nRegardless, what is the legal basis for the Court\u2019s order\ntelling the District Court it must reconsider the matter?\nThere is no clear error. No one has asked the District\nCourt for modification. And the scope of relief is primarily\na question for the District Court. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 15 (1971) (\u201cOnce a\nright and a violation have been shown, the scope of a\ndistrict court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is\nbroad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable\nremedies\u201d).\n                             VI\n  As the length of the opinions indicates, this case re\u00ad\nquires us to read a highly detailed record. Members of\nthis Court have reached different conclusions about what\nthat record says. But there is more to the case than that.\n  First, even if one sees this case as simply a technical\nrecord-reading case, the disagreement among us shows\nwhy this Court should ordinarily hesitate to hear cases\nthat require us to do no more than to review a lengthy\nrecord simply to determine whether a lower court\u2019s fact\u00ad\nbased determinations are correct. Cf. Universal Camera,\n340 U. S., at 488 (\u201c[A] court may [not] displace\u201d a \u201cchoice\nbetween two fairly conflicting views, even though the court\nwould justifiably have made a different choice had the\nmatter been before it de novo\u201d); Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.\nLinde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949) (noting\nthe well-settled rule that this court will not \u201cundertake to\nreview concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in\n44                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of\nerror\u201d). In such cases, appellate courts are closer to the\nfray, better able to reach conclusions that are true to the\nrecord, and are more likely to treat trial court determina\u00ad\ntions fairly and with respect\u2014as is clearly so here.\n   Second, insofar as the Court goes beyond the technical\nrecord-based aspects of this case and applies a new review\nframework, it risks problems in future cases. The frame\u00ad\nwork it applies is incomplete and lacks clear legal support\nor explanation. And it will be difficult for lower courts to\nunderstand and to apply that framework, particularly if it\nrests on a distinction between \u201cinstitutional reform litiga\u00ad\ntion\u201d and other forms of litigation. Does the Court mean\nto say, for example, that courts must, on their own, go\nbeyond a party\u2019s own demands and relitigate an underly\u00ad\ning legal violation whenever that party asks for modifica\u00ad\ntion of an injunction? How could such a rule work in\npractice? See supra, at 21\u201323. Does the Court mean to\nsuggest that there are other special, strict pro-defendant\nrules that govern review of district court decisions in\n\u201cinstitutional reform cases\u201d? What precisely are those\nrules? And when is a case an \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d case?\nAfter all, as I have tried to show, see supra, at 18\u201319, the\ncase before us cannot easily be fitted onto the Court\u2019s\nProcrustean \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d bed.\n   Third, the Court may mean its opinion to express an\nattitude, cautioning judges to take care when the enforce\u00ad\nment of federal statutes will impose significant financial\nburdens upon States. An attitude, however, is not a rule\nof law. Nor does any such attitude point towards vacating\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion here. The record makes\nclear that the District Court did take care. See supra, at\n15. And the Court of Appeals too proceeded with care,\nproducing a detailed opinion that is both true to the record\nand fair to the lower court and to the parties\u2019 submissions\nas well. I do not see how this Court can now require lower\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          45\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncourt judges to take yet greater care, to proceed with even\ngreater caution, while at the same time expecting those\ncourts to enforce the statute as Congress intended.\n   Finally, we cannot and should not fail to acknowledge\nthe underlying subject matter of this proceeding. The case\nconcerns the rights of Spanish-speaking students, attend\u00ad\ning public school near the Mexican border, to learn Eng\u00ad\nlish in order to live their lives in a country where English\nis the predominant language. In a Nation where nearly 47\nmillion people (18% of the population) speak a language\nother than English at home, U. S. Dept. of Commerce,\nEconomics and Statistics Admin., Census Bureau, Census\n2000 Brief: Language Use and English-Speaking Ability 2\n(Oct. 2003), it is important to ensure that those children,\nwithout losing the cultural heritage embodied in the lan\u00ad\nguage of their birth, nonetheless receive the English\u00ad\nlanguage tools they need to participate in a society where\nthat second language \u201cserves as the fundamental medium\nof social interaction\u201d and democratic participation.\nRodr\u00edguez, Language and Participation, 94 Cal. L. Rev.\n687, 693 (2006). In that way linguistic diversity can com\u00ad\nplement and support, rather than undermine, our democ\u00ad\nratic institutions. Id., at 688.\n   At least, that is what Congress decided when it set\nfederal standards that state officials must meet. In doing\nso, without denying the importance of the role of state and\nlocal officials, it also created a role for federal judges,\nincluding judges who must see that the States comply\nwith those federal standards. Unfortunately, for reasons I\nhave set forth, see Part II, supra, the Court\u2019s opinion will\nmake it more difficult for federal courts to enforce those\nfederal standards. Three decades ago, Congress put this\nstatutory provision in place to ensure that our Nation\u2019s\nschool systems will help non-English-speaking schoolchil\u00ad\ndren overcome the language barriers that might hinder\ntheir participation in our country\u2019s schools, workplaces,\n46                   HORNE v.

FLORES ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u2013289.      Argued April 20, 2009\u2014Decided June 25, 2009*\nA group of English Language-Learner (ELL) students and their parents\n   (plaintiffs) filed a class action, alleging that Arizona, its State Board\n   of Education, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction (defen\n   dants) were providing inadequate ELL instruction in the Nogales\n   Unified School District (Nogales), in violation of the Equal Educa\n   tional Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires States to\n   take \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers\u201d in schools,\n   20 U. S. C. \u00a71703(f). In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a\n   declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because\n   the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of\n   ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not re\n   lated to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. The District\n   Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years fol\n   lowing, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions. The de\n   fendants did not appeal any of the District Court\u2019s orders. In 2006,\n   the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, in\n   creased ELL incremental funding. The incremental funding increase\n   required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state\n   attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill.\n   The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing\n   HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here. The\n   Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of\n   the State Senate (Legislators) intervened and, with the superinten\n   dent (collectively, petitioners), moved to purge the contempt order in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 08\u2013294, Speaker of Arizona House of Representa\ntives et al. v. Flores et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2                          HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    light of HB 2064. In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal\n    Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). The District Court denied their mo\n    tion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule\n    60(b)(5) claim. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an\n    evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted\n    Rule 60(b)(5). On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5)\n    motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding\n    system. Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had\n    not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant re\n    lief.\nHeld:\n    1. The superintendent has standing. To establish Article III stand\n ing, a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized,\n and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s chal\n lenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling. Lujan v. De\n fenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560\u2013561. Here, the superintendent\n was a named defendant, the declaratory judgment held him in viola\n tion of the EEOA, and the injunction runs against him. Because the\n superintendent has standing, the Court need not consider whether\n the Legislators also have standing. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    2. The lower courts did not engage in the proper analysis under\n Rule 60(b)(5). Pp. 10\u201334.\n       (a) Rule 60(b)(5), which permits a party to seek relief from a\n judgment or order if \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions\n or in law\u201d renders continued enforcement \u201cdetrimental to the public\n interest,\u201d Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 384,\n serves a particularly important function in \u201cinstitutional reform liti\n gation,\u201d id., at 380. Injunctions in institutional reform cases often\n remain in force for many years, during which time changed circum\n stances may warrant reexamination of the original judgment. In\n junctions of this sort may also raise sensitive federalism concerns,\n which are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree\n has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities. Finally, in\n stitutional reform injunctions bind state and local officials to their\n predecessors\u2019 policy preferences and may thereby \u201cimproperly deprive\n future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.\u201d\n Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 441. Because of these features of in\n stitutional reform litigation, federal courts must take a \u201cflexible ap\n proach\u201d to Rule 60(b)(5) motions brought in this context, Rufo, supra,\n at 381, ensuring that \u201cresponsibility for discharging the State\u2019s obli\n gations is returned promptly to the State and its officials\u201d when cir\n cumstances warrant, Frew, supra, at 442. Courts must remain atten\n tive to the fact that \u201cfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if\n they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [fed\n                   Cite as: 557 U.

Thus, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry\nis whether the EEOA violation underlying the 2000 order has been\nremedied. If it has, the order\u2019s continued enforcement is unnecessary\nand improper. Pp. 10\u201314.\n     (b) The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5)\nanalysis just described. Pp. 14\u201323.\n        (i) Its Rule 60(b)(5) standard was too strict. The Court of Ap\npeals explained that situations in which changed circumstances war\nrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief are \u201clikely rare,\u201d and that, to succeed, peti\ntioners had to show that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to\n\u201csweep away\u201d the District Court\u2019s incremental funding determina\ntion. The Court of Appeals also incorrectly reasoned that federalism\nconcerns were substantially lessened here because the State and the\nState Board of Education wanted the injunction to remain in place.\nPp. 14\u201315.\n        (ii) The Court of Appeals\u2019 inquiry was also too narrow, focusing\nalmost exclusively on the sufficiency of ELL incremental funding. It\nattributed undue significance to petitioners\u2019 failure to appeal the Dis\ntrict Court\u2019s 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexi\nble changed circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo. The Court of\nAppeals\u2019 inquiry was, effectively, an inquiry into whether the 2000\norder had been satisfied. But satisfaction of an earlier judgment is\nonly one of Rule 60(b)(5)\u2019s enumerated bases for relief. Petitioners\ncould obtain relief on the independent basis that prospective en\nforcement of the order was \u201cno longer equitable.\u201d To determine the\nmerits of this claim, the Court of Appeals should have ascertained\nwhether the 2000 order\u2019s ongoing enforcement was supported by an\nongoing EEOA violation. Although the EEOA requires a State to\ntake \u201cappropriate action,\u201d it entrusts state and local authorities with\nchoosing how to meet this obligation. By focusing solely on ELL in\ncremental funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended this man\ndate. And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate \u201cappropriate ac\ntion\u201d through a particular funding mechanism, it improperly\nsubstituted its own policy judgments for those of the state and local\nofficials entrusted with the decisions. Pp. 15\u201318.\n     (c) The District Court\u2019s opinion reveals similar errors. Rather\nthan determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief\nfrom the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied\nthat order through increased ELL incremental funding. Pp. 18\u201320.\n     (d) Because the Court of Appeals and the District Court misper\nceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the\nRule 60(b)(5) inquiry, this case must be remanded for a proper ex\namination of at least four factual and legal changes that may war\n4                          HORNE v.

Pp. 23\u201334.\n           (i) After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a \u201cbi\n    lingual education\u201d methodology of ELL instruction to \u201cstructured\n    English immersion\u201d (SEI). Research on ELL instruction and findings\n    by the State Department of Education support the view that SEI is\n    significantly more effective than bilingual education. A proper Rule\n    60(b)(5) analysis should entail further factual findings regarding\n    whether Nogales\u2019 implementation of SEI is a \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d\n    warranting relief. Pp. 23\u201325.\n           (ii) Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001\n    (NCLB), which represents another potentially significant \u201cchanged\n    circumstance.\u201d Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily\n    constitute \u201cappropriate action\u201d under the EEOA, NCLB is relevant to\n    petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted\n    the State to make significant structural and programming changes in\n    its ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for\n    education in general and ELL programming in particular; it provided\n    evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales\u2019 ELL students\n    through its assessment and reporting requirements; and it marked a\n    shift in federal education policy. Pp. 25\u201329.\n           (iii) Nogales\u2019 superintendent instituted significant structural\n    and management reforms which, among other things, reduced class\n    sizes, improved student/teacher ratios, and improved the quality of\n    teachers. Entrenched in the incremental funding framework, the\n    lower courts failed to recognize that these changes may have brought\n    Nogales\u2019 ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even\n    without sufficient incremental funding to satisfy the 2000 order.\n    This was error. Because the EEOA focuses on the quality of educa\n    tional programming and services to students, not the amount of\n    money spent, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners\n    from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant ELL pro\n    gramming in ways other than through increased incremental fund\n    ing. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should\n    ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements,\n    Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL\n    students. Pp. 29\u201332.\n           (iv) There was an overall increase in education funding avail\n    able in Nogales. The Court of Appeals foreclosed the possibility that\n    petitioners could show that this overall increase was sufficient to\n    support EEOA-compliant ELL programming. This was clear legal\n    error. The EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement does not neces\n    sarily require a particular level of funding, and to the extent that\n    funding is relevant, the EEOA does not require that the money come\n    from a particular source. Thus, the District Court should evaluate\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      5\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  whether the State\u2019s general education funding budget, in addition to\n  local revenues, currently supports EEOA-compliant ELL program\n  ming in Nogales. Pp. 32\u201334.\n    3. On remand, if petitioners press their objection to the injunction\n  as it extends beyond Nogales, the lower courts should consider\n  whether the District Court erred in entering statewide relief. The re\n  cord contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district\n  other than Nogales failed to provide equal educational opportunities\n  to ELL students, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA\n  can justify a statewide injunction here. The state attorney general\u2019s\n  concern that a \u201cNogales only\u201d remedy would run afoul of the Arizona\n  Constitution\u2019s equal-funding requirement did not provide a valid ba\n  sis for a statewide federal injunction, for it raises a state-law question\n  to be determined by state authorities. Unless the District Court con\n  cludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA statewide, it should vacate\n  the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales.

S. C. \u00a71703(f), which requires a State \u201cto take\nappropriate action to overcome language barriers that\nimpede equal participation by its students in its instruc\ntional programs.\u201d In 2000, the District Court entered a\ndeclaratory judgment with respect to Nogales, and in\n2001, the court extended the order to apply to the entire\nState. Over the next eight years, petitioners repeatedly\nsought relief from the District Court\u2019s orders, but to no\n2                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\navail. We granted certiorari after the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of petitioners\u2019 mo\ntion for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n60(b)(5), and we now reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.\n   As we explain, the District Court and the Court of Ap\npeals misunderstood both the obligation that the EEOA\nimposes on States and the nature of the inquiry that is\nrequired when parties such as petitioners seek relief\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) on the ground that enforcement of a\njudgment is \u201cno longer equitable.\u201d Both of the lower\ncourts focused excessively on the narrow question of the\nadequacy of the State\u2019s incremental funding for ELL\ninstruction instead of fairly considering the broader ques\ntion whether, as a result of important changes during the\nintervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation\nunder the EEOA by other means. The question at issue in\nthese cases is not whether Arizona must take \u201cappropriate\naction\u201d to overcome the language barriers that impede\nELL students. Of course it must. But petitioners argue\nthat Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by\nnew means that reflect new policy insights and other\nchanged circumstances. Rule 60(b)(5) provides the vehicle\nfor petitioners to bring such an argument.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  In 1992, a group of students enrolled in the ELL pro\ngram in Nogales and their parents (plaintiffs) filed suit in\nthe District Court for the District of Arizona on behalf of\n\u201call minority \u2018at risk\u2019 and limited English proficient chil\ndren . . . now or hereafter, enrolled in the Nogales Unified\nSchool District . . . as well as their parents and guardi\nans.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2309069\"><a href=\"/opinion/2309069/flores-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See, e.g.,\nKimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73 (2000).

At a hearing in February 2006, a new attorney\ngeneral opposed the superintendent\u2019s request for a stay of\nthe December 2005 order imposing sanctions and fines,\nand filed a proposed distribution of the accrued fines.\n   In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines,\nthe state legislature passed HB 2064, which was designed\nto implement a permanent funding solution to the prob\nlems identified by the District Court in 2000. Among\nother things, HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding\n(with a 2-year per-student limit on such funding) and\ncreated two new funds\u2014a structured English immersion\nfund and a compensatory instruction fund\u2014to cover addi\ntional costs of ELL programming. Moneys in both newly\ncreated funds were to be offset by available federal mon\neys. HB 2064 also instituted several programming and\nstructural changes.\n   The Governor did not approve of HB 2064\u2019s funding\nprovisions, but she allowed the bill to become law without\n6                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nher signature. Because HB 2064\u2019s incremental ELL fund\ning increase required court approval to become effective,\nthe Governor requested the attorney general to move for\naccelerated consideration by the District Court. In doing\nso, she explained that \u201c \u2018[a]fter nine months of meetings\nand three vetoes, it is time to take this matter to a federal\njudge. I am convinced that getting this bill into court now\nis the most expeditious way ultimately to bring the state\ninto compliance with federal law.\u2019 \u201d Flores v. Arizona, 516\nF. 3d 1140, 1153, n. 16 (CA9 2008). The State Board of\nEducation joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064.\nTogether, the State Board of Education, the State of Ari\nzona, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.\n   With the principal defendants in the action siding with\nthe plaintiffs, the Speaker of the State House of Represen\ntatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators)\nfiled a motion to intervene as representatives of their\nrespective legislative bodies. App. 55. In support of their\nmotion, they stated that although the attorney general\nhad a \u201clegal duty\u201d to defend HB 2064, the attorney general\nhad shown \u201clittle enthusiasm\u201d for advancing the legisla\nture\u2019s interests. Id., at 57. Among other things, the Legis\nlators noted that the attorney general \u201cfailed to take an\nappeal of the judgment entered in this case in 2000 and\nhas failed to appeal any of the injunctions and other or\nders issued in aid of the judgment.\u201d Id., at 60. The Dis\ntrict Court granted the Legislators\u2019 motion for permissive\nintervention, and the Legislators and superintendent\n(together, petitioners here) moved to purge the District\nCourt\u2019s contempt order in light of HB 2064. Alternatively,\nthey moved for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances.\n   In April 2006, the District Court denied petitioners\u2019\nmotion, concluding that HB 2064 was fatally flawed in\nthree respects. First, while HB 2064 increased ELL in\ncremental funding by approximately $80 per student, the\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt held that this increase was not rationally related to\neffective ELL programming. Second, the court concluded\nthat imposing a 2-year limit on funding for each ELL\nstudent was irrational. Third, according to the court, HB\n2064 violated federal law by using federal funds to \u201csup\nplant\u201d rather than \u201csupplement\u201d state funds.

The court did\nnot address petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) claim that changed\ncircumstances rendered continued enforcement of the\noriginal declaratory judgment order inequitable. Petition\ners appealed.\n   In an unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit vacated the District Court\u2019s April 2006\norder, the sanctions, and the imposition of fines, and\nremanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine\nwhether Rule 60(b)(5) relief was warranted. 204 Fed.\nAppx. 580 (2006).\n   On remand, the District Court denied petitioners\u2019 Rule\n60(b)(5) motion. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We need\nnot consider whether respondents\u2019 chain-of-command\nargument has merit because the Governor has, in fact,\ndirected an appeal. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner\nSuperintendent 1 (\u201cI hereby direct [the State attorney\ngeneral] to file a brief at the [Supreme] Court on behalf of\nthe State of Arizona adopting and joining in the positions\ntaken by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the\nSpeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and the\nPresident of the Arizona Senate\u201d).\n   Because the superintendent clearly has standing to\nchallenge the lower courts\u2019 decisions, we need not consider\nwhether the Legislators also have standing to do so.2 See,\ne.g., Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 264, and n. 9 (1977) (\u201c[W]e have\nat least one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated\nstanding . . . .

Had the superintendent sought relief based on satisfaction of the\njudgment, the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion might have been correct.\nBut as discussed infra, at 15\u201316, petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) claim is not\nbased on satisfaction of the judgment. Their claim is that continued\nenforcement of the District Court\u2019s orders would be inequitable. This\nclaim implicates the orders in their entirety, and not solely as they run\nagainst the superintendent.\n10                        HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nneed not consider whether the other individual and corpo\nrate plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit\u201d). Ac\ncordingly, we proceed to the merits of petitioners\u2019 Rule\n60(b)(5) motion.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) permits a party\nto obtain relief from a judgment or order if, among other\nthings, \u201capplying [the judgment or order] prospectively is\nno longer equitable.\u201d Rule 60(b)(5) may not be used to\nchallenge the legal conclusions on which a prior judgment\nor order rests, but the Rule provides a means by which a\nparty can ask a court to modify or vacate a judgment or\norder if \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions\nor in law\u201d renders continued enforcement \u201cdetrimental to\nthe public interest.\u201d Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail, 502 U. S. 367, 384 (1992). The party seeking relief\nbears the burden of establishing that changed circum\nstances warrant relief, id., at 383, but once a party carries\nthis burden, a court abuses its discretion \u201cwhen it refuses\nto modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such\nchanges.\u201d Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 215 (1997).\n  Rule 60(b)(5) serves a particularly important function in\nwhat we have termed \u201cinstitutional reform litigation.\u201d3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The dissent is quite wrong in contending that these are not institu\n\ntional reform cases because they involve a statutory, rather than a\nconstitutional claim, and because the orders of the District Court do not\nmicromanage the day-to-day operation of the schools. Post, at 26\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). For nearly a decade, the orders of a federal\ndistrict court have substantially restricted the ability of the State of\nArizona to make basic decisions regarding educational policy, appro\npriations, and budget priorities. The record strongly suggests that\nsome state officials have welcomed the involvement of the federal court\nas a means of achieving appropriations objectives that could not be\nachieved through the ordinary democratic process. See supra, at 5\u20136.\nBecause of these features, these cases implicate all of the unique\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)       11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nRufo, supra, at 380. For one thing, injunctions issued in\nsuch cases often remain in force for many years, and the\npassage of time frequently brings about changed circum\nstances\u2014changes in the nature of the underlying problem,\nchanges in governing law or its interpretation by the\ncourts, and new policy insights\u2014that warrant reexamina\ntion of the original judgment.\n   Second, institutional reform injunctions often raise\nsensitive federalism concerns. Such litigation commonly\ninvolves areas of core state responsibility, such as public\neducation. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 99\n(1995) (\u201c[O]ur cases recognize that local autonomy of\nschool districts is a vital national tradition, and that a\ndistrict court must strive to restore state and local au\nthorities to the control of a school system operating in\ncompliance with the Constitution\u201d (citations omitted));\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 580 (1995)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Federalism concerns are heightened when, as in these\ncases, a federal court decree has the effect of dictating\nstate or local budget priorities. States and local govern\nments have limited funds. When a federal court orders\nthat money be appropriated for one program, the effect is\noften to take funds away from other important programs.\nSee Jenkins, supra, at 131 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cA\nstructural reform decree eviscerates a State\u2019s discretion\nary authority over its own program and budgets and forces\nstate officials to reallocate state resources and funds\u201d).\n   Finally, the dynamics of institutional reform litigation\ndiffer from those of other cases. Scholars have noted that\npublic officials sometimes consent to, or refrain from\nvigorously opposing, decrees that go well beyond what is\nrequired by federal law. See, e.g., McConnell, Why Hold\nElections?

But in recognition of the features of\ninstitutional reform decrees, we have held that courts\nmust take a \u201cflexible approach\u201d to Rule 60(b)(5) motions\naddressing such decrees. Rufo, 502 U. S., at 381. A flexi\nble approach allows courts to ensure that \u201cresponsibility\nfor discharging the State\u2019s obligations is returned\npromptly to the State and its officials\u201d when the circum\nstances warrant. Frew, supra, at 442. In applying this\nflexible approach, courts must remain attentive to the fact\nthat \u201cfederal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if\nthey are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not\nviolate [federal law] or does not flow from such a viola\ntion.\u201d Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977). \u201cIf [a\nfederal consent decree is] not limited to reasonable and\nnecessary implementations of federal law,\u201d it may \u201cim\nproperly deprive future officials of their designated legis\nlative and executive powers.\u201d Frew, supra, at 441.\n   For these reasons, a critical question in this Rule\n60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the objective of the District\nCourt\u2019s 2000 declaratory judgment order\u2014i.e., satisfaction\nof the EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d standard\u2014has been\nachieved. See 540 U. S., at 442. If a durable remedy has\nbeen implemented, continued enforcement of the order is\nnot only unnecessary, but improper. See Milliken, supra,\nat 282.

Rather than applying a flexible\nstandard that seeks to return control to state and local\nofficials as soon as a violation of federal law has been\nremedied, the Court of Appeals used a heightened stan\ndard that paid insufficient attention to federalism con\ncerns. And rather than inquiring broadly into whether\nchanged conditions in Nogales provided evidence of an\nELL program that complied with the EEOA, the Court of\nAppeals concerned itself only with determining whether\nincreased ELL funding complied with the original declara\ntory judgment order. The court erred on both counts.\n                                1\n   The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion\nby citing the correct legal standard, see 516 F. 3d, at 1163\n(noting that relief is appropriate upon a showing of \u201c \u2018a\nsignificant change either in factual conditions or in law\u2019 \u201d),\nbut it quickly strayed. It referred to the situations in\nwhich changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief\nas \u201clikely rare,\u201d id., at 1167, and explained that, to succeed\non these grounds, petitioners would have to make a show\ning that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to \u201csweep\naway\u201d the District Court\u2019s incremental funding determina\ntion, id., at 1168. The Court of Appeals concluded that the\nDistrict Court had not erred in determining that \u201cthe\nlandscape was not so radically changed as to justify relief\nfrom judgment without compliance.\u201d Id., at 1172 (empha\nsis added).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The dissent conveniently dismisses the Court of Appeals\u2019 statements\n\nby characterizing any error that exists as \u201cone of tone, not of law,\u201d and\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

This statement is flatly incorrect, as\neven respondents acknowledge. Brief for Respondent\nState of Arizona et al. 20\u201321. Precisely because different\nstate actors have taken contrary positions in this litiga\ntion, federalism concerns are elevated. And precisely\nbecause federalism concerns are heightened, a flexible\napproach to Rule 60(b)(5) relief is critical. \u201c[W]hen the\nobjects of the decree have been attained\u201d\u2014namely, when\nEEOA compliance has been achieved\u2014\u201cresponsibility for\ndischarging the State\u2019s obligations [must be] returned\npromptly to the State and its officials.\u201d Frew, 540 U.

In\nlarge part, this was driven by the significance the Court of\nAppeals attributed to petitioners\u2019 failure to appeal the\nDistrict Court\u2019s original order. The Court of Appeals\nexplained that \u201cthe central idea\u201d of that order was that\nwithout sufficient ELL incremental funds, \u201cELL programs\nwould necessarily be inadequate.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1167\u2013\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nby characterizing our discussion as reading them out of context.

It felt bound by this conclusion, lest it allow peti\ntioners to \u201creopen matters made final when the Declara\ntory Judgment was not appealed.\u201d Id., at 1170. It re\npeated this refrain throughout its opinion, emphasizing\nthat the \u201cinterest in finality must be given great weight,\u201d\nid., at 1163, and explaining that petitioners could not now\nask for relief \u201con grounds that could have been raised on\nappeal from the Declaratory Judgment and from earlier\ninjunctive orders but were not,\u201d id., at 1167. \u201cIf [petition\ners] believed that the district court erred and should have\nlooked at all funding sources differently in its EEOA\ninquiry,\u201d the court wrote, \u201cthey should have appealed the\nDeclaratory Judgment.\u201d Id., at 1171.\n   In attributing such significance to the defendants\u2019 fail\nure to appeal the District Court\u2019s original order, the Court\nof Appeals turned the risks of institutional reform litiga\ntion into reality. By confining the scope of its analysis to\nthat of the original order, it insulated the policies embed\nded in the order\u2014specifically, its incremental funding\nrequirement\u2014from challenge and amendment.5 But those\npolicies were supported by the very officials who could\nhave appealed them\u2014the state defendants\u2014and, as a\nresult, were never subject to true challenge.\n   Instead of focusing on the failure to appeal, the Court of\nAppeals should have conducted the type of Rule 60(b)(5)\ninquiry prescribed in Rufo. This inquiry makes no refer\nence to the presence or absence of a timely appeal. It\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 This does not mean, as the dissent misleadingly suggests, see post,\n\nat 22, that we are faulting the Court of Appeals for declining to decide\nwhether the District Court\u2019s original order was correct in the first\nplace. On the contrary, as we state explicitly in the paragraph follow\ning this statement, our criticism is that the Court of Appeals did not\nengage in the changed-circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367 (1992). By focusing\nexcessively on the issue of incremental funding, the Court of Appeals\nwas not true to the Rufo standard.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes the original judgment as a given and asks only\nwhether \u201ca significant change either in factual conditions\nor in law\u201d renders continued enforcement of the judgment\n\u201cdetrimental to the public interest.\u201d Rufo, 502 U. S., at\n384. It allows a court to recognize that the longer an\ninjunction or consent decree stays in place, the greater the\nrisk that it will improperly interfere with a State\u2019s democ\nratic processes.\n   The Court of Appeals purported to engage in a \u201cchanged\ncircumstances\u201d inquiry, but it asked only whether changed\ncircumstances affected ELL funding and, more specifi\ncally, ELL incremental funding. Relief was appropriate,\nin the court\u2019s view, only if petitioners \u201cdemonstrate[d]\neither that there [we]re no longer incremental costs asso\nciated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona\u2019s\n\u2018base plus incremental costs\u2019 educational funding model\nwas so altered that focusing on ELL-specific incremental\ncosts funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.\u201d 516\nF. 3d, at 1169.\n   This was a Rule 60(b)(5) \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d in\nquiry in name only. In reality, it was an inquiry into\nwhether the deficiency in ELL incremental funding that\nthe District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied.\nAnd this, effectively, was an inquiry into whether the\noriginal order had been satisfied. Satisfaction of an earlier\njudgment is one of the enumerated bases for Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief\u2014but it is not the only basis for such relief.\n   Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where \u201c[i]\nthe judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged;\n[ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has been re\nversed or vacated; or [iii] applying it prospectively is no\nlonger equitable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Use of the disjunc\ntive \u201cor\u201d makes it clear that each of the provision\u2019s three\ngrounds for relief is independently sufficient and therefore\nthat relief may be warranted even if petitioners have not\n\u201csatisfied\u201d the original order. As petitioners argue, they\n18                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay obtain relief if prospective enforcement of that order\n\u201cis no longer equitable.\u201d\n   To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of\nAppeals needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement\nof the original order was supported by an ongoing violation\nof federal law (here, the EEOA). See Milliken, 433 U. S.,\nat 282. It failed to do so.\n   As previously noted, the EEOA, while requiring a State\nto take \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barri\ners,\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a71703(f), \u201cleave[s] state and local educa\ntional authorities a substantial amount of latitude in\nchoosing\u201d how this obligation is met. Castaneda, 648\nF. 2d, at 1009. Of course, any educational program, in\ncluding the \u201cappropriate action\u201d mandated by the EEOA,\nrequires funding, but funding is simply a means, not the\nend. By focusing so intensively on Arizona\u2019s incremental\nELL funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the\nEEOA\u2019s mandate. And by requiring petitioners to demon\nstrate \u201cappropriate action\u201d through a particular funding\nmechanism, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted\nits own educational and budgetary policy judgments for\nthose of the state and local officials to whom such deci\nsions are properly entrusted. Cf. Jenkins, 515 U. S., at\n131 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\u201cFederal courts do not pos\nsess the capabilities of state and local governments in\naddressing difficult educational problems\u201d).\n                            C\n   The underlying District Court opinion reveals similar\nerrors. In an August 2006 remand order, a different Ninth\nCircuit panel had instructed the District Court to hold an\nevidentiary hearing \u201cregarding whether changed circum\nstances required modification of the original court order or\notherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.\u201d 204\nFed. Appx., at 582. The Ninth Circuit panel observed that\n\u201cfederal courts must be sensitive to the need for modifica\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion [of permanent injunctive relief] when circumstances\nchange.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The District Court failed to follow these instructions.\nInstead of determining whether changed circumstances\nwarranted modification of the original order, the District\nCourt asked only whether petitioners had satisfied the\noriginal declaratory judgment order through increased\nincremental funding. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (ex\nplaining that a showing of \u201cmere amelioration\u201d of the\nspecific deficiencies noted in the District Court\u2019s original\norder was \u201cinadequate\u201d and that \u201ccompliance would re\nquire a funding system that rationally relates funding\navailable to the actual costs of all elements of ELL in\nstruction\u201d (emphasis added)). The District Court stated:\n\u201cIt should be noted that the Court finds the same problems\ntoday that it saw last year, because HB 2064 is the same,\nthe problems themselves are the same.6 Id., at 1161. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In addition to concluding that the law\u2019s increase in incremental\n\nfunding was insufficient and that 2-year cutoff was irrational, both the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals held that HB 2064\u2019s funding\nmechanism violates NCLB, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA State\nshall not take into consideration payments under this chapter . . . in\ndetermining the eligibility of any local educational agency in that State\nfor State aid, or the amount of State aid, with respect to free public\neducation of children.\u201d 20 U. S. C. \u00a77902. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1166\n(HB 2064\u2019s funding mechanism is \u201cabsolutely forbidden\u201d by \u00a77902); 516\nF. 3d, at 1178 (\u201cHB 2064 . . . violates [\u00a77902] on its face\u201d). Whether or\nnot HB 2064 violates \u00a77902, see Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 31\u201332, and n. 8 (suggesting it does), neither court below was\nempowered to decide the issue. As the Court of Appeals itself recog\nnized, NCLB does not provide a private right of action. See 516 F. 3d,\nat 1175. \u201cWithout [statutory intent], a cause of action does not exist\nand courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be\nas a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.\u201d Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286\u2013287 (2001). Thus, NCLB is enforceable\nonly by the agency charged with administering it. See id., at 289\u2013290;\nsee also App. to Brief for Respondent State of Arizona et al. 1\u20134 (letter\nfrom U. S. Department of Education to petitioner superintendent\nconcerning the legality vel non of HB 2064).\n20                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court thus rested its postremand decision on its\npreremand analysis of HB 2064. It disregarded the re\nmand instructions to engage in a broad and flexible Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis as to whether changed circumstances\nwarranted relief. In taking this approach, the District\nCourt abused its discretion.\n                              D\n   The dissent defends the narrow approach of the lower\ncourts with four principal conclusions that it draws from\nthe record. All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect\nand mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts\u2014a\nfixation on the issue of incremental funding and a failure\nto recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry.\n   First, the dissent concludes that \u201cthe Rule 60(b)(5)\n\u2018changes\u2019 upon which the District Court focused\u201d were not\nlimited to changes in funding, and included \u201c \u2018changed\nteaching methods\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018changed administrative sys\ntems.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 12. The District Court did note a range of\nchanged circumstances, concluding that as a result of\nthese changes, Nogales was \u201cdoing substantially better.\u201d\n480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160. But it neither focused on these\nchanges nor made up-to-date factual findings. To the\ncontrary, the District Court explained that \u201cit would be\npremature to make an assessment of some of these\nchanges.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, of the 28 findings of fact that\nthe court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed fund\ning directly and exclusively. See id., at 1161\u20131163. The\nlast eight addressed funding indirectly\u2014discussing reclas\nsification rates because of their relevance to HB 2064\u2019s\nfunding restrictions for ELL and reclassified students.\nSee id., at 1163\u20131165. None of the District Court\u2019s find\nings of fact addressed either \u201c \u2018changed teaching methods\u2019 \u201d\nor \u201c \u2018changed administrative systems.\u2019 \u201d\n   The dissent\u2019s second conclusion is that \u201c \u2018incremental\nfunding\u2019 costs . . . [were] the basic contested issue at the\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court\u2019s find\ning of a statutory violation.\u201d Post, at 12. We fail to see\nthis conclusion\u2019s relevance to this Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\nwhere the question is whether any change in factual or\nlegal circumstances renders continued enforcement of the\noriginal order inequitable. As the dissent itself acknowl\nedges, petitioners \u201cpointed to three sets of changed cir\ncumstances [in their Rule 60(b)(5) motion] which, in their\nview, showed that the judgment and the related orders\nwere no longer necessary.\u201d Post, at 11. In addition to\n\u201cincreases in the amount of funding available to Arizona\nschool districts,\u201d these included \u201cchanges in the method of\nEnglish-learning instruction,\u201d and \u201cchanges in the admini\nstration of the Nogales school district.\u201d Ibid.\n  Third, the dissent concludes that \u201cthe type of issue upon\nwhich the District Court and Court of Appeals focused\u201d\u2014\nthe incremental funding issue\u2014\u201clies at the heart of the\nstatutory demand for equal educational opportunity.\u201d\nPost, at 13. In what we interpret to be a restatement of\nthis point, the dissent also concludes that sufficient fund\ning (\u201cthe \u2018resource\u2019 issue\u201d) and the presence or absence of\nan EEOA violation (\u201cthe statutory subsection (f) issue\u201d) \u201care\none and the same.\u201d Post, at 14 (emphasis in original). \u201cIn\nfocusing upon the one,\u201d the dissent asserts, \u201cthe District\nCourt and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.\u201d\nIbid.\n  Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, these two issues are\ndecidedly not \u201cone and the same.\u201d7 Ibid. Nor is it the case,\nas the dissent suggests, that the EEOC targets States\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The extent to which the dissent repeats the errors of the courts be\n\nlow is evident in its statement that \u201c[t]he question here is whether the\nState has shown that its new funding program amounts to a \u2018change\u2019\nthat satisfies subsection (f)\u2019s requirement.\u201d Post, at 40 (emphasis\nadded). The proper inquiry is not limited to the issue of funding.\nRather, it encompasses the question whether the State has shown any\nfactual or legal changes that establish compliance with the EEOA.\n22                        HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision of resources for ELL programming.8 Post, at 13.\nWhat the statute forbids is a failure to take \u201cappropriate\naction to overcome language barriers.\u201d          20 U. S. C.\n\u00a71703(f). Funding is merely one tool that may be em\nployed to achieve the statutory objective.\n  Fourth, the dissent concludes that the District Court did\nnot order increased ELL incremental funding and did not\ndictate state and local budget priorities. Post, at 15. The\ndissent\u2019s point\u2014and it is a very small one\u2014is that the\nDistrict Court did not set a specific amount that the legis\nlature was required to appropriate. The District Court\ndid, however, hold the State in contempt and impose\nheavy fines because the legislature did not provide suffi\ncient funding. These orders unquestionably imposed\nimportant restrictions on the legislature\u2019s ability to set\nbudget priorities.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The dissent cites two sources for this proposition.        The first\u2014\nCastaneda v. Pickard, 648 F. 2d 989 (CA5 1981)\u2014sets out a three-part\ntest for \u201cappropriate action.\u201d Under that test, a State must (1) formu\nlate a sound English language instruction educational plan, (2) imple\nment that plan, and (3) achieve adequate results. See id., at 1009\u2013\n1010. Whether or not this test provides much concrete guidance\nregarding the meaning of \u201cappropriate action,\u201d the test does not focus\non incremental funding or on the provision of resources more generally.\n   The second source cited by the dissent\u2014curiously\u2014is a speech given\nby President Nixon in which he urged prompt action by Congress on\nlegislation imposing a moratorium on new busing orders and on the\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act of 1972. See post, at 13 (citing\nAddress to the Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8\nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 590, 591 (1972)). In the speech, President\nNixon said that schools in poor neighborhoods should receive the\n\u201cfinancial support . . . that we know can make all the difference.\u201d Id.,\nat 593. It is likely that this statement had nothing to do with the\ninterpretation of EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement and instead\nreferred to his proposal to \u201cdirec[t] over $21\u20442 billion in the next year\nmainly towards improving the education of children from poor fami\nlies.\u201d Id., at 591. But in any event, this general statement, made in a\npresidential speech two years prior to the enactment of the EEOA,\nsurely sheds little light on the proper interpretation of the statute.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)         23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                            E\n  Because the lower courts\u2014like the dissent\u2014\nmisperceived both the nature of the obligation imposed by\nthe EEOA and the breadth of the inquiry called for under\nRule 60(b)(5), these cases must be remanded for a proper\nexamination of at least four important factual and legal\nchanges that may warrant the granting of relief from the\njudgment: the State\u2019s adoption of a new ELL instructional\nmethodology, Congress\u2019 enactment of NCLB, structural\nand management reforms in Nogales, and increased over\nall education funding.\n                             1\n  At the time of the District Court\u2019s original declaratory\njudgment order, ELL instruction in Nogales was based\nprimarily on \u201cbilingual education,\u201d which teaches core\ncontent areas in a student\u2019s native language while provid\ning English instruction in separate language classes. In\nNovember 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203,\nwhich mandated statewide implementation of a \u201cstruc\ntured English immersion\u201d (SEI) approach. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 08\u2013294, p. 369a. Proposition 203\ndefines this methodology as follows:\n    \u201c \u2018Sheltered English immersion\u2019 or \u2018structured English\n    immersion\u2019 means an English language acquisition\n    process for young children in which nearly all class\n    room instruction is in English but with the curriculum\n    and presentation designed for children who are learn\n    ing the language. . . . Although teachers may use a\n    minimal amount of the child\u2019s native language when\n    necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any\n    language other than English, and children in this pro\n    gram learn to read and write solely in English.\u201d Ariz.\n    Rev.

It also required the State Board of Education to\ninstitute a uniform and mandatory training program for\nall SEI instructors. \u00a715\u2013756.09.\n  Research on ELL instruction indicates there is docu\nmented, academic support for the view that SEI is signifi\ncantly more effective than bilingual education.10 Findings\nof the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004\nstrongly support this conclusion.11 In light of this, a\nproper analysis of petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion should\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 By focusing on the adequacy of HB 2064\u2019s funding provisions, the\n\ncourts below neglected to address adequately the potential relevance of\nthese programming provisions, which became effective immediately\nupon enactment of the law.\n   10 See Brief for American Unity Legal Defense Fund et al. as Amici\n\nCuriae 10\u201312 (citing sources, including New York City Board of Educa\ntion, Educational Progress of Students in Bilingual and ESL Programs:\na Longitudinal Study, 1990\u20131994 (1994); K.

FLORES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThey note that when a State adopts a compliance plan\nunder NCLB\u2014as the State of Arizona has\u2014it must pro\nvide adequate assurances that ELL students will receive\nassistance \u201cto achieve at high levels in the core academic\nsubjects so that those children can meet the same . . .\nstandards as all children are expected to meet.\u201d \u00a76812(2).\nThey argue that when the Federal Department of Educa\ntion approves a State\u2019s plan\u2014as it has with respect to\nArizona\u2019s\u2014it offers definitive evidence that the State has\ntaken \u201cappropriate action to overcome language barriers\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the EEOA. \u00a71703(f).\n   The Court of Appeals concluded, and we agree, that\nbecause of significant differences in the two statutory\nschemes, compliance with NCLB will not necessarily\nconstitute \u201cappropriate action\u201d under the EEOA. 516\nF. 3d, at 1172\u20131176. Approval of a NCLB plan does not\nentail substantive review of a State\u2019s ELL programming or\na determination that the programming results in equal\neducational opportunity for ELL students. See \u00a76823.\nMoreover, NCLB contains a saving clause, which provides\nthat \u201c[n]othing in this part shall be construed in a manner\ninconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil\nright.\u201d \u00a76847.\n   This does not mean, however, that NCLB is not relevant\nto petitioners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion. To the contrary, we\nthink it is probative in four principal ways.12 First, it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Although the dissent contends that the sole argument raised below\nregarding NCLB was that compliance with that Act necessarily consti\ntuted compliance with the EEOA, the Court of Appeals recognized that\nNCLB is a relevant factor that should be considered under Rule\n60(b)(5). It acknowledged that compliance with NCLB is at least\n\u201csomewhat probative\u201d of compliance with the EEOA. 516 F. 3d, at\n1175, n. 46. The United States, in its brief as amicus curiae supporting\nrespondents, similarly observed that, \u201c[e]ven though Title III participa\ntion is not a complete defense under the EEOA, whether a State is\nreaching its own goals under Title III may be relevant in an EEOA\nsuit.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.

These changes should not be discounted in the\nRule 60(b)(5) analysis solely because they do not require or\nresult from increased funding. Second, NCLB signifi\ncantly increased federal funding for education in general\nand ELL programming in particular.14 These funds\nshould not be disregarded just because they are not state\nfunds. Third, through its assessment and reporting re\nquirements, NCLB provides evidence of the progress and\nachievement of Nogales\u2019 ELL students.15 This evidence\ncould provide persuasive evidence of the current effective\nness of Nogales\u2019 ELL programming.16\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCourt noted that, \u201c[b]y increasing the standards of accountability,\n[NCLB] has to some extent significantly changed State educators\napproach to educating students in Arizona.\u201d 480 F.

NCLB\ngrants States \u201cflexibility\u201d to adopt ELL programs they\nbelieve are \u201cmost effective for teaching English.\u201d \u00a76812(9).\nReflecting a growing consensus in education research that\nincreased funding alone does not improve student\nachievement,17 NCLB expressly refrains from dictating\nfunding levels. Instead, it focuses on the demonstrated\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\napparent in the AIMS test results and reclassification test results\u201d); id.,\nat 1169\u20131170 (citing \u201cthe persistent achievement gaps documented in\n[Nogales\u2019] AIMS test data\u201d between ELL students and native speakers).\nWe do not think the District Court made sufficient factual findings to\nsupport its conclusions about the effectiveness of Nogales\u2019 ELL pro\ngramming, and we question the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the\ndata for three reasons. First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the\nabsence of longitudinal data in the record precludes useful compari\nsons. See id., at 1155. Second, the AIMS tests\u2014the statewide\nachievement tests on which the Court of Appeals primarily relied and\nto which the dissent cites in Appendix A of its opinion\u2014are adminis\ntered in English. It is inevitable that ELL students (who, by definition,\nare not yet proficient in English) will underperform as compared to\nnative speakers. Third, the negative data that the Court of Appeals\nhighlights is balanced by positive data. See, e.g., App. 97 (reporting\nthat for the 2005\u20132006 school year, on average, reclassified students\ndid as well as, if not better than, native English speakers on the AIMS\ntests).\n  17 See, e.g., Hanushek, The Failure of Input-Based Schooling Policies,\n\n113 Economic J. F64, F69 (2003) (reviewing U. S. data regarding \u201cinput\npolicies\u201d and concluding that although such policies \u201chave been vigor\nously pursued over a long period of time,\u201d there is \u201cno evidence that the\nadded resources have improved student performance\u201d); A.

This conflict with\nCongress\u2019 determination of federal policy may constitute a\nsignificantly changed circumstance, warranting relief. See\nRailway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 651 (1961)\n(noting that a court decree should be modified when \u201ca\nchange in law brings [the decree] in conflict with statutory\nobjectives\u201d).\n                             3\n  Structural and management reforms in Nogales consti\ntute another relevant change in circumstances. These\nreforms were led by Kelt Cooper, the Nogales superinten\ndent from 2000 to 2005, who \u201cadopted policies that amelio\nrated or eliminated many of the most glaring inadequacies\ndiscussed by the district court.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1156.\nAmong other things, Cooper \u201creduce[d] class sizes,\u201d \u201csig\nnificantly improv[ed] student/teacher ratios,\u201d \u201cimproved\nteacher quality,\u201d \u201cpioneered a uniform system of textbook\nand curriculum planning,\u201d and \u201clargely eliminated what\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 Education literature overwhelmingly supports reliance on account\nability-based reforms as opposed to pure increases in spending. See,\ne.g., Hanushek & Raymond, Does School Accountability Lead to Im\nproved Student Performance? 24 J. Pol\u2019y Analysis & Mgmt. 297, 298\n(2005) (concluding that \u201cthe introduction of accountability systems into\na state tends to lead to larger achievement growth than would have\noccurred without accountability\u201d); U.

FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been a severe shortage of instructional materials.\u201d\nId., at 1156\u20131157. The Court of Appeals recognized that\nby \u201c[u]sing careful financial management and applying for\n\u2018all funds available,\u2019 Cooper was able to achieve his re\nforms with limited resources.\u201d Id., at 1157. But the Court\nof Appeals missed the legal import of this observation\u2014\nthat these reforms might have brought Nogales\u2019 ELL\nprogramming into compliance with the EEOA even with\nout sufficient ELL incremental funding to satisfy the\nDistrict Court\u2019s original order. Instead, the Court of Ap\npeals concluded that to credit Cooper\u2019s reforms would\n\u201cpenaliz[e]\u201d Nogales \u201cfor doing its best to make do, despite\nArizona\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the judg\nment,\u201d and would \u201cabsolve the state from providing ade\nquate ELL incremental funding as required by the judg\nment.\u201d    Id., at 1168.      The District Court similarly\ndiscounted Cooper\u2019s achievements, acknowledging that\nNogales was \u201cdoing substantially better than it was in\n2000,\u201d but concluding that because the progress resulted\nfrom management efforts rather than increased funding,\nits progress was \u201cfleeting at best.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1160.\n   Entrenched in the framework of incremental funding,\nboth courts refused to consider that Nogales could be\ntaking \u201cappropriate action\u201d to address language barriers\neven without having satisfied the original order. This was\nerror. The EEOA seeks to provide \u201cequal educational\nopportunity\u201d to \u201call children enrolled in public schools.\u201d\n\u00a71701(a). Its ultimate focus is on the quality of educa\ntional programming and services provided to students, not\nthe amount of money spent on them. Accordingly, there is\nno statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing\nthat Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant programming\nby means other than increased funding\u2014for example,\nthrough Cooper\u2019s structural, curricular, and accountabil\nity-based reforms. The weight of research suggests that\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   31\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthese types of local reforms, much more than court\nimposed funding mandates, lead to improved educational\nopportunities.19 Cooper even testified that, without the\nstructural changes he imposed, \u201cadditional money\u201d would\nnot \u201chave made any difference to th[e] students\u201d in No\ngales. Addendum to Reply Brief for Petitioner Speaker of\nthe Arizona House of Representatives et al. 15.\n   The Court of Appeals discounted Cooper\u2019s reforms for\nother reasons as well. It explained that while they \u201cdid\nameliorate many of the specific examples of resource\nshortages that the district court identified in 2000,\u201d they\ndid not \u201cresult in such success as to call into serious ques\ntion [Nogales\u2019] need for increased incremental funds.\u201d 516\nF. 3d, at 1169. Among other things, the Court of Appeals\nreferred to \u201cthe persistent achievement gaps documented\nin [Nogales\u2019] AIMS test data\u201d between ELL students and\nnative speakers, id., at 1170, but any such comparison\nmust take into account other variables that may explain\nthe gap. In any event, the EEOA requires \u201cappropriate\naction\u201d to remove language barriers, \u00a71703(f), not the\nequalization of results between native and nonnative\nspeakers on tests administered in English\u2014a worthy goal,\nto be sure, but one that may be exceedingly difficult to\nachieve, especially for older ELL students.\n   The Court of Appeals also referred to the subpar per\nformance of Nogales\u2019 high schools. There is no doubt that\nNogales\u2019 high schools represent an area of weakness, but\nthe District Court made insufficient factual findings to\nsupport a conclusion that the high schools\u2019 problems stem\nfrom a failure to take \u201cappropriate action,\u201d and constitute\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 See, e.g., M.

FLORES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\na violation of the EEOA.20\n   The EEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement grants\nStates broad latitude to design, fund, and implement ELL\nprograms that suit local needs and account for local condi\ntions. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this\nand should ask whether, as a result of structural and\nmanagerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal\neducational opportunities to ELL students.\n                             4\n  A fourth potentially important change is an overall\nincrease in the education funding available in Nogales.\nThe original declaratory judgment order noted five sources\nof funding that collectively financed education in the\nState: (1) the State\u2019s \u201cbase level\u201d funding, (2) ELL incre\nmental funding, (3) federal grants, (4) regular district and\ncounty taxes, and (5) special voter-approved district and\ncounty taxes called \u201coverrides.\u201d 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1227.\nAll five sources have notably increased since 2000.21\nNotwithstanding these increases, the Court of Appeals\nrejected petitioners\u2019 claim that overall education funds\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  20 There are many possible causes for the performance of students in\n\nNogales\u2019 high school ELL programs. These include the difficulty of\nteaching English to older students (many of whom, presumably, were\nnot in English-speaking schools as younger students) and problems,\nsuch as drug use and the prevalence of gangs. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 14\u2013\n15; Reply Brief for Petitioner Superintendent 16\u201317; App. 116\u2013118. We\nnote that no court has made particularized findings as to the effective\nness of ELL programming offered at Nogales\u2019 high schools.\n  21 The Court of Appeals reported, and it is not disputed, that \u201c[o]n an\n\ninflation-adjusted statewide basis, including all sources of funding,\nsupport for education has increased from $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to an\nestimated $3,570 per pupil in 2006. Adding in all county and local\nsources, funding has gone from $5,677 per pupil in 2000 to an esti\nmated $6,412 per pupil in 2006. Finally, federal funding has increased.\nIn 2000, the federal government provided an additional $526 per pupil;\nin 2006, it provided an estimated $953.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1155.\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                33\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwere sufficient to support EEOA-compliant programming\nin Nogales. The court reasoned that diverting base-level\neducation funds would necessarily hurt other state educa\ntional programs, and was not, therefore, an \u201c \u2018appropriate\u2019\nstep.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at 1171. In so doing, it foreclosed the\npossibility that petitioners could establish changed cir\ncumstances warranting relief through an overall increase\nin education funding available in Nogales.\n   This was clear legal error. As we have noted, the\nEEOA\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d requirement does not neces\nsarily require any particular level of funding, and to the\nextent that funding is relevant, the EEOA certainly does\nnot require that the money come from any particular\nsource. In addition, the EEOA plainly does not give the\nfederal courts the authority to judge whether a State or a\nschool district is providing \u201cappropriate\u201d instruction in\nother subjects. That remains the province of the States\nand the local schools. It is unfortunate if a school, in order\nto fund ELL programs, must divert money from other\nworthwhile programs, but such decisions fall outside the\nscope of the EEOA. Accordingly, the analysis of petition\ners\u2019 Rule 60(b)(5) motion should evaluate whether the\nState\u2019s budget for general education funding, in addition\nto any local revenues,22 is currently supporting EEOA\ncompliant ELL programming in Nogales.\n   Because the lower courts engaged in an inadequate Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis, and because the District Court failed to\nmake up-to-date factual findings, the analysis of the lower\ncourts was incomplete and inadequate with respect to all\nof the changed circumstances just noted. These changes\nare critical to a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, however, as\nthey may establish that Nogales is no longer in violation of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  22 Each year since 2000, Nogales voters have passed an override.\n\nRevenues from Nogales\u2019 override have increased from $895,891 in 2001\nto $1,674,407 in 2007.

FLORES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe EEOA and, to the contrary, is taking \u201cappropriate\naction\u201d to remove language barriers in its schools. If this\nis the case, continued enforcement of the District Court\u2019s\noriginal order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule\n60(b)(5), and relief is warranted.\n                              IV\n   We turn, finally, to the District Court\u2019s entry of state\nwide relief.23 The Nogales district, which is situated along\nthe Mexican border, is one of 239 school districts in the\nState of Arizona. Nogales students make up about one\nhalf of one per cent of the entire State\u2019s school popula\ntion.24 The record contains no factual findings or evidence\nthat any school district other than Nogales failed (much\nless continues to fail) to provide equal educational oppor\ntunities to ELL students. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n08\u2013294, pp. 177a\u2013178a. Nor have respondents explained\nhow the EEOA could justify a statewide injunction when\nthe only violation claimed or proven was limited to a\nsingle district. See Jenkins, 515 U. S., at 89\u201390; Milliken,\n433 U. S., at 280. It is not even clear that the District\nCourt had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   23 The dissent contends that this issue was not raised below, but what\n\nis important for present purposes is that, for the reasons explained in\nthe previous parts of this opinion, these cases must be remanded to the\nDistrict Court for a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis. Petitioners made it\nclear at oral argument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63 (\u201cHere the EEOA has been transmogrified to apply state\nwide. That has not been done before. It should not have been done in\nthe first instance but certainly in light of the changed circumstances\u201d);\nsee also id., at 17\u201318, 21, 26. Accordingly, if petitioners raise that\nargument on remand, the District Court must consider whether there is\nany legal or factual basis for denying that relief.\n   24 See Ariz.

If the state attorney general\nbelieved that a federal injunction requiring increased ELL\nspending in one district necessitated, as a matter of state\nlaw, a similar increase in every other district in the State,\nthe attorney general could have taken the matter to the\nstate legislature or the state courts. But the attorney\ngeneral did not do so. Even if she had, it is not clear what\nthe result would have been. It is a question of state law,\nto be determined by state authorities, whether the equal\nfunding provision of the Arizona Constitution would re\nquire a statewide funding increase to match Nogales\u2019 ELL\nfunding, or would leave Nogales as a federally compelled\nexception. By failing to recognize this, and by entering a\nstatewide injunction that intruded deeply into the State\u2019s\nbudgetary processes based solely on the attorney general\u2019s\ninterpretation of state law, the District Court obscured\naccountability for the drastic remedy that it entered.\n   When it is unclear whether an onerous obligation is the\nwork of the Federal or State Government, accountability is\ndiminished. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n169 (1992). Here, the District Court \u201cimproperly pre\nvent[ed] the citizens of the State from addressing the issue\n[of statewide relief] through the processes provided by the\n36                   HORNE v.

Assuming\nthat petitioners, on remand, press their objection to the\nstatewide extension of the remedy, the District Court\nshould vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond\nNogales unless the court concludes that Arizona is violat\ning the EEOA on a statewide basis.\n  There is no question that the goal of the EEOA\u2014\novercoming language barriers\u2014is a vitally important one,\nand our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to\nachieve that goal.

S. 367, 384 (1992), entitled them to relief. The\nState of Arizona, the Arizona Board of Education, and the\noriginal plaintiffs in the case (representing students from\nNogales, Arizona) opposed the superintendent\u2019s Rule\n60(b)(5) motion. They are respondents here.\n   The District Court, after taking evidence and holding\neight days of hearings, considered all the changed circum\u00ad\nstances that the parties called to its attention. The court\nconcluded that some relevant \u201cchanges\u201d had taken place.\nBut the court ultimately found those changes insufficient\nto warrant setting aside the original judgment. The Court\nof Appeals, in a carefully reasoned 41-page opinion, af\u00ad\nfirmed that district court determination. This Court now\nsets the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision aside. And it does so, it\nsays, because \u201cthe lower courts focused excessively on the\nnarrow question of the adequacy of the State\u2019s incremental\nfunding for [English-learning] instruction instead of fairly\nconsidering the broader question, whether, as a result of\nimportant changes during the intervening years, the State\nwas fulfilling its obligation\u201d under the Act \u201cby other\nmeans.\u201d Ante, at 2 (emphasis added).\n   The Court reaches its ultimate conclusion\u2014that the\nlower courts did not \u201cfairly consider\u201d the changed circum\u00ad\nstances\u2014in a complicated way. It begins by placing this\ncase in a category it calls \u201cinstitutional reform litigation.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. It then sets forth special \u201cinstitutional reform\nlitigation\u201d standards applicable when courts are asked to\nmodify judgments and decrees entered in such cases. It\napplies those standards, and finds that the lower courts\ncommitted error.\n   I disagree with the Court for several reasons. For one\nthing, the \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d label does not easily fit\nthis case. For another, the review standards the Court\nenunciates for \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d cases are incomplete\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand, insofar as the Court applies those standards here,\nthey effectively distort Rule 60(b)(5)\u2019s objectives. Finally,\nmy own review of the record convinces me that the Court\nis wrong regardless. The lower courts did \u201cfairly consider\u201d\nevery change in circumstances that the parties called to\ntheir attention. The record more than adequately supports\nthis conclusion. In a word, I fear that the Court misap\u00ad\nplies an inappropriate procedural framework, reaching a\nresult that neither the record nor the law adequately\nsupports. In doing so, it risks denying schoolchildren the\nEnglish-learning instruction necessary \u201cto overcome lan\u00ad\nguage barriers that impede\u201d their \u201cequal participation.\u201d\n20 U. S. C. \u00a71703(f).\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  To understand my disagreement with the Court, it is\nunfortunately necessary to examine the record at length\nand in detail. I must initially focus upon the Court\u2019s basic\ncriticism of the lower courts\u2019 analysis, namely that the\nlower courts somehow lost sight of the forest for the trees.\nIn the majority\u2019s view, those courts\u2014as well as this dis\u00ad\nsent\u2014wrongly focused upon a subsidiary matter, \u201cincre\u00ad\nmental\u201d English-learning program \u201cfunding,\u201d rather than\nthe basic matter, whether \u201cchanges\u201d had cured, or had\ncome close to curing, the violation of federal law that\nunderlay the original judgment. Ante, at 2. In the Court\u2019s\nview, it is as if a district court, faced with a motion to\ndissolve a school desegregation decree, focused only upon\nthe school district\u2019s failure to purchase 50 decree-required\nschool buses, instead of discussing the basic question,\nwhether the schools had become integrated without need\nfor those 50 buses.\n  Thus the Court writes that the lower courts focused so\nheavily on the original decree\u2019s \u201cincremental funding\u201d\nrequirement that they failed to ask whether \u201cthe State\n4                     HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwas fulfilling its obligation under\u201d federal law \u201cby other\nmeans.\u201d Ibid. And the Court frequently criticizes the\nCourt of Appeals for having \u201cfocused almost exclusively on\nthe sufficiency of incremental funding,\u201d ante, at 15; for\n\u201cconfining the scope of its analysis to\u201d the \u201cincremental\nfunding requirement,\u201d ante, at 16; for having \u201casked only\nwhether changed circumstances affected [English\u00ad\nlearning] funding and, more specifically . . . incremental\nfunding,\u201d ante, at 17; for inquiring only \u201cinto whether the\ndeficiency in . . . incremental funding that the District\nCourt identified in 2000 had been remedied,\u201d ibid.; and (in\ncase the reader has not yet gotten the point) for \u201cfocusing\nso intensively on Arizona\u2019s incremental . . . funding,\u201d ante.,\nat 18. The Court adds that the District Court too was\nwrong to have \u201casked only whether petitioners had satis\u00ad\nfied the original declaratory judgment order through\nincreased incremental funding.\u201d Ante, at 19.\n   The problem with this basic criticism is that the State\u2019s\nprovision of adequate resources to its English-learning\nstudents, i.e., what the Court refers to as \u201cincremental\nfunding,\u201d has always been the basic contested issue in this\ncase. That is why the lower courts continuously focused\nattention directly upon it. In the context of this case they\nlooked directly at the forest, not the trees. To return to\nthe school desegregation example, the court focused upon\nthe heart of the matter, the degree of integration, and not\nupon the number of buses the school district had pur\u00ad\nchased. A description of the statutory context and the\nhistory of this case makes clear that the Court cannot\nsensibly drive a wedge (as it wishes to do) between what it\ncalls the \u201cincremental funding\u201d issue and the uncured\nfailure to comply with the requirements of federal law.\n                              1\n  The lawsuit filed in this case charged a violation of\nsubsection (f) of \u00a7204 of the Equal Educational Opportuni\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Second, that court should determine\n\u201cwhether the programs and practices actually used by\n[the] school system are reasonably calculated to imple\u00ad\nment effectively the educational theory adopted by the\nschool,\u201d which is to say that the school system must \u201cfol\u00ad\nlow through with practices, resources and personnel neces\u00ad\nsary to transform\u201d its chosen educational theory \u201cinto\nreality.\u201d Id., at 1010 (emphasis added).

In 1992, they\nfiled the present lawsuit against the State of Arizona, its\nBoard of Education, and the superintendent, claiming that\nthe State had violated subsection (f), not by failing to\nadopt proper English-learning programs, but by failing \u201cto\nprovide financial and other resources necessary\u201d to make\nthose programs a practical reality for Spanish-speaking\nstudents. App. 7, \u00b620 (emphasis added); see Castaneda,\nsupra, at 1010 (second, i.e., \u201cresource,\u201d requirement).

Supp. 2d, at\n1227\u20131228.\n  (2) In the year 2000, the \u201cbase level amount\u201d the State\nassumed necessary to educate a typical child amounted to\nroughly $3,174 (in year 2000 dollars). Id., at 1227.\n  (3) A cost study conducted by the State in 1988 showed\nthat, at that time, English-learning programming cost\nschool districts an additional $424 per English-learning\nchild. Id., at 1228. Adjusted for inflation to the year 2000,\nthe extra cost per student of the State\u2019s English-learning\nprogram was $617 per English-learning child.\n  (4) In the year 2000, the State\u2019s funding formula pro\u00ad\nvided school districts with only $150 to pay for the $617 in\nextra costs per child that the State assumed were needed\nto pay for its English-learning program.

The bill would\nalso increase the appropriation for teaching English to\nstudents who needed to learn it (though it prohibited the\nspending of any increase upon any particular student for\nmore than two years). In March 2006, the petitioners here\n(the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, the\nPresident of Arizona\u2019s Senate, and the Speaker of its\nHouse of Representatives) asked the District Court (1) to\nconsider whether HB 2064, as enacted, would satisfy its\njudgment and injunctive orders, (2) to forgive the con\u00ad\ntempt fine liability that the State had accrued, and (3) to\ndissolve the injunctive orders and grant relief from the\n2000 judgment.

The \u201csig\u00ad\nnificant changed circumstances\u201d identified amounted to\nchanges in the very circumstances that underlay the initial\nfinding of violation, namely Arizona\u2019s funding-based fail\u00ad\nure to provide adequate English-learning educational\nresources. The moving parties asserted that \u201cArizona has\npoured money\u201d into Nogales as a result of various funding\nchanges, id., at 5.

In August 2006, the\nCourt of Appeals ordered the District Court to decide that\nmotion, and, in particular, to consider whether changes to\n\u201cthe landscape of educational funding . . . required modifi\u00ad\ncation of the original court order or otherwise had a bear\u00ad\ning on the appropriate remedy.\u201d 204 Fed. Appx. 580, 582\n(CA9 2006) (memorandum).\n   In January 2007, the District Court held a hearing that\nlasted eight days and produced an evidentiary transcript\nof 1,684 pages. The hearing focused on the changes that\nthe petitioners said had occurred and justified setting\naside the original judgment. The petitioners pointed to\nthree sets of changed circumstances\u2014all related to \u201cprac\u00ad\ntices, resources, and personnel\u201d\u2014which, in their view,\nshowed that the judgment and the related orders were no\nlonger necessary. They argued that the changes had\nbrought the State into compliance with the Act\u2019s require\u00ad\nments. The three sets of changes consisted of (1) increases\nin the amount of funding available to Arizona school dis\u00ad\ntricts; (2) changes in the method of English-learning in\u00ad\nstruction; and (3) changes in the administration of the\nNogales school district. These changes, the petitioners\nsaid, had cured the resource-linked deficiencies that were\nnoted in the District Court\u2019s 2000 judgment, 172 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1239, and rendered enforcement of the judgment\nand related orders unnecessary.\n   Based on the hearing and the briefs, the District Court\n12                   HORNE v.

The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusions,\nsetting forth its reasons, as I have said, in a lengthy and\ndetailed opinion. The state superintendent, along with the\nSpeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and the\nPresident of the Arizona Senate, sought certiorari, and we\ngranted the petition.\n                              B\n   Five conclusions follow from the description of the case I\nhave just set forth. First, the Rule 60(b)(5) \u201cchanges\u201d upon\nwhich the District Court focused included the \u201cchanged\nteaching methods\u201d and the \u201cchanged administrative sys-\ntems\u201d that the Court criticizes the District Court for ignor-\ning. Compare ante, at 23\u201325, 29\u201331, with Parts III\u2013A, III\u2013\nC, infra. Those changes were, in the petitioners\u2019 view,\nrelated to the \u201cfunding\u201d issue, for those changes reduced\nthe need for increased funding. See Motion to Purge, p. 7.\nI concede that the majority of the District Court\u2019s factual\nfindings focused on funding, see ante, at 20. But where is\nthe legal error, given that the opinion clearly shows that\nthe District Court considered, \u201c \u2018focus[ed]\u2019 \u201d upon, and\nwrote about all the matters petitioners raised? Ibid.; 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1160\u20131161.\n   Second, the District Court and the Court of Appeals\nfocused more heavily upon \u201cincremental funding\u201d costs,\nsee ante, at 15\u201320, for the reason that the State\u2019s provision\nfor those costs\u2014i.e., its provision of the resources neces-\nsary to run an adequate English-learning program\u2014was\nthe basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

That is, the sole subsec\u00ad\ntion (f) dispute in the case originally was whether the\nState provides the \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary\u201d to implement its English-learning program.\nCastaneda, 648 F. 2d, at 1010. To be sure, as the Court\npoints out, changes other than to the State\u2019s funding\nsystem could demonstrate that Nogales was receiving the\nnecessary resources. See, e.g., ante, at 23\u201325. But given\nthe centrality of \u201cresources\u201d to the case, it is hardly sur\u00ad\nprising that the courts below scrutinized the State\u2019s provi\u00ad\nsion of \u201cincremental funding,\u201d but without ignoring the\nother related changes to which petitioners pointed, such as\nchanges in teaching methods and administration (all of\nwhich the District Court rejected as insufficient). See Part\nIII, infra.\n   Third, the type of issue upon which the District Court\nand Court of Appeals focused lies at the heart of the statu\u00ad\ntory demand for equal educational opportunity. A State\u2019s\nfailure to provide the \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary\u201d to eliminate the educational burden that ac\u00ad\ncompanies a child\u2019s inability to speak English is precisely\nwhat the statute forbids. See Castaneda, supra, at 1010\n(emphasizing the importance of providing \u201cresources\u201d);\nNixon Address 593 (referring to the importance of provid\u00ad\ning \u201cfinancial support\u201d). And no one in this case suggests\nthere is no need for those resources, e.g., that there are no\nextra costs associated with English-learning education\nirrespective of the teaching method used.            English\u00ad\nlearning students, after all, not only require the instruc\u00ad\ntion in \u201cacademic content areas\u201d like math and science\nthat \u201ctypical\u201d students require, but they also need to\nincrease their proficiency in speaking, reading, and writ\u00ad\ning English.

Fin. & Pol\u2019y 90,\n100 (2008) (estimating that English-learning students\nrequire 74% more resources than typical students).

Supp. 2d, at 1161.\n   Fourth, the \u201cresource\u201d issue that the District Court\nfocused upon when it decided the Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\nand the statutory subsection (f) issue that lies at the heart\nof the court\u2019s original judgment (and the plaintiffs\u2019 original\ncomplaint) are not different issues, as the Court claims.\nSee ante, at 21\u201322. Rather in all essential respects they\nare one and the same issue. In focusing upon the one, the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon\nthe other. For all practical purposes, changes that would\nhave proved sufficient to show the statutory violation\ncured would have proved sufficient to warrant setting\naside the original judgment and decrees, and vice versa.\nAnd in context, judges and parties alike were fully aware\nof the modification/violation relationship. See, e.g., Inter\u00ad\nvenor-Defendants\u2019 Closing Argument Memorandum, No.\nCV\u201392\u2013596\u2013TUC\u2013RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt.

Of\ncourse, a State might violate the Act in other ways. But\none way in which a State can violate the Act is to fail to\nprovide necessary \u201cpractices, resources, and personnel.\u201d\nAnd that is the way the District Court found that the\nState had violated the Act here. Thus, whatever might be\ntrue of some other case, in this case the failure to provide\nadequate resources and the underlying subsection (f)\nviolation were one and the same thing.\n   Fifth, the Court is wrong when it suggests that the\nDistrict Court ordered \u201cincreased incremental funding,\u201d\nante, at 19; when it faults the District Court for effectively\n\u201cdictating state or local budget priorities,\u201d ante, at 11;\nwhen it claims that state officials welcomed the result \u201cas\na means of achieving appropriations objectives,\u201d ante, at\n10, n. 3; and when it implies that the District Court\u2019s\norders required the State to provide a \u201cparticular level of\nfunding,\u201d ante, at 33. The District Court ordered the State\nto produce a plan that set forth a \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cra\u00ad\ntional\u201d relationship between the needs of English-learning\nstudents and the resources provided to them. The orders\nexpressed no view about what kind of English-learning\nprogram the State should use. Nor did the orders say\nanything about the amount of \u201cappropriations\u201d that the\nState must provide, ante, at 10, n. 3, or about any \u201cparticu\u00ad\nlar funding mechanism,\u201d ante, at 18, that the State was\nobligated to create. Rather, the District Court left it up to\nthe State \u201cto recommend [to the legislature] the level of\nfunding necessary to support the programs that it deter\u00ad\nmined to be the most effective.\u201d 160 F. Supp. 2d, at 1044.\nIt ordered no more than that the State (whatever kind of\nprogram it decided to use) must see that the chosen pro\u00ad\ngram benefits from a funding system that is not \u201carbitrary\nand capricious,\u201d but instead \u201cbear[s] a rational relation\u00ad\n16                   HORNE v.

Thus\nthe Court\u2019s basic criticism of the lower court decisions is\nwithout foundation. I turn next to the Court\u2019s discussion\nof the standards of review the Court finds applicable to\n\u201cinstitutional reform\u201d litigation.\n   To understand my concern about the Court\u2019s discussion\nof standards, it is important to keep in mind the well\u00ad\nknown standards that ordinarily govern the evaluation of\nRule 60(b)(5) motions. The Rule by its terms permits\nmodification of a judgment or order (1) when \u201cthe judg\u00ad\nment has been satisfied,\u201d (2) \u201creleased,\u201d or (3) \u201cdis\u00ad\ncharged;\u201d when the judgment or order (4) \u201cis based on an\nearlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated;\u201d or (5)\n\u201capplying [the judgment] prospectively is no longer equi\u00ad\ntable.\u201d No one can claim that the second, third, or fourth\ngrounds are applicable here. The relevant judgment and\norders have not been released or discharged; nor is there\nany relevant earlier judgment that has been reversed or\nvacated. Thus the only Rule 60(b)(5) questions are\nwhether the judgment and orders have been satisfied, or,\nif not, whether their continued application is \u201cequitable.\u201d\nAnd, as I have explained, in context these come down to\nthe same question: Is continued enforcement inequitable\nbecause the defendants have satisfied the 2000 declara\u00ad\ntory judgment or at least have come close to doing so, and,\ngiven that degree of satisfaction, would it work unneces\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

See supra,\nat 14.\n  To show sufficient inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief, a party must show that \u201ca significant change either\nin factual conditions or in law\u201d renders continued en\u00ad\nforcement of the judgment or order \u201cdetrimental to the\npublic interest.\u201d Rufo, 502 U. S., at 384. The party can\nclaim that \u201cthe statutory or decisional law has changed to\nmake legal what the decree was designed to prevent.\u201d Id.,\nat 388; see also Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S.\n642, 651 (1961). Or the party can claim that relevant facts\nhave changed to the point where continued enforcement of\nthe judgment, order, or decree as written would work, say,\ndisproportionately serious harm. See Rufo, supra, at 384\n(modification may be appropriate when changed circum\u00ad\nstances make enforcement \u201csubstantially more onerous\u201d or\n\u201cunworkable because of unforeseen obstacles\u201d).\n  The Court acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that Rufo\u2019s \u201cflexible standard\u201d for relief applies.\nThe Court also acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that this \u201cflexible standard\u201d does not itself define\nthe inquiry a court passing on a Rule 60(b)(5) motion must\nmake. To give content to this standard, the Court refers to\nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977), in which\nthis Court said that a decree cannot seek to \u201celiminat[e] a\ncondition that does not violate\u201d federal law or \u201cflow from\nsuch a violation,\u201d ante, at 13, and to Frew v. Hawkins, 540\nU. S. 431, 441 (2004), in which this Court said that a\n\u201cconsent decree\u201d must be \u201climited to reasonable and neces\u00ad\nsary implementations of federal law\u201d (emphasis added;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Ante, at 13.

If not\u2014i.e., if a current\nviolation of federal law cannot be detected\u2014then \u201c \u2018respon\u00ad\nsibility for discharging the State\u2019s obligations [must be]\nreturned promptly to the State.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 15.\n   One problem with the Court\u2019s discussion of its standards\nis that insofar as the considerations it mentions are widely\naccepted, the lower courts fully acknowledged and fol\u00ad\nlowed them. The decisions below, like most Rule 60(b)(5)\ndecisions, reflect the basic factors the Court mentions.\nThe lower court opinions indicate an awareness of the fact\nthat equitable decrees are subject to a \u201cflexible standard\u201d\npermitting modification when circumstances, factual or\nlegal, change significantly.      516 F. 3d, at 1163; 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (citing Rufo, supra, at 383). The\nDistrict Court\u2019s application of Castaneda\u2019s interpretation\nof subsection (f), 648 F. 2d, at 1009, along with its efforts\nto provide state officials wide discretionary authority\n(about the level of funding and the kind of funding plan),\nshow considerable sensitivity to \u201cfederalism concerns.\u201d\nAnd given the many years (at least seven) of state non\u00ad\ncompliance, it is difficult to see how the decree can have\nremained in place too long.\n   Nor is the decree at issue here a \u201cconsent decree\u201d as that\nterm is normally understood in the institutional litigation\ncontext. See ante, at 10\u201313. The State did consent to a\nfew peripheral matters that have nothing to do with the\npresent appeal. App. 19\u201330. But the State vigorously\ncontested the plaintiffs\u2019 basic original claim, namely, that\nthe State failed to take resource-related \u201cappropriate\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The State pre\u00ad\nsented proofs and evidence to the District Court designed\nto show that no violation of federal law had occurred, and\nit opposed entry of the original judgment and every subse\u00ad\nquent injunctive order, save the relief sought by petition\u00ad\ners here. I can find no evidence, beyond the Court\u2019s specu\u00ad\nlation, showing that some state officials have \u201cwelcomed\u201d\nthe District Court\u2019s decision \u201cas a means of achieving\nappropriations objectives that could not [otherwise] be\nachieved.\u201d Ante, at 10, n. 3. But even were that so, why\nwould such a fact matter here more than in any other case\nin which some state employees believe a litigant who sues\nthe State is right? I concede that the State did not appeal\nthe District Court\u2019s original order or the ensuing injunc\u00ad\ntions. But the fact that litigants refrain from appealing\ndoes not turn a litigated judgment into a \u201cconsent decree.\u201d\nAt least, I have never before heard that term so used.\n   Regardless, the Court\u2019s discussion of standards raises a\nfar more serious problem. In addition to the standards I\nhave discussed, supra, at 16\u201317, our precedents recognize\nother, here outcome-determinative, hornbook principles\nthat apply when a court evaluates a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.\nThe Court omits some of them. It mentions but fails to\napply others. As a result, I am uncertain, and perhaps\nothers will be uncertain, whether the Court has set forth a\ncorrect and workable method for analyzing a Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion.\n   First, a basic principle of law that the Court does not\nmention\u2014a principle applicable in this case as in others\u2014\nis that, in the absence of special circumstances (e.g., plain\nerror), a judge need not consider issues or factors that the\nparties themselves do not raise. That principle of law is\nlongstanding, it is reflected in Blackstone, and it perhaps\ncomes from yet an earlier age. 3 Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 455 (1768) (\u201c[I]t is a practice unknown to\nour law\u201d when examining the decree of an inferior court,\n20                    HORNE v.

S. 418, 425 (1876) (\u201cMatters not assigned for error will\nnot be examined\u201d); see also Savage v. United States, 92\nU. S. 382, 388 (1876) (where a party with the \u201cburden . . .\nto establish\u201d a \u201ccharge . . . fails to introduce any . . . evi\u00ad\ndence to support it, the presumption is that the charge is\nwithout any foundation\u201d); McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of\nTechnology, 950 F. 2d 13, 22 (CA1 1991) (\u201cIt is hornbook\nlaw that theories not raised squarely in the district court\ncannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal\u201d for\n\u201c[o]verburdened trial judges cannot be expected to be mind\nreaders\u201d). As we have recognized, it would be difficult to\noperate an adversary system of justice without applying\nsuch a principle. See Duignan v. United States, 274 U. S.\n195, 200 (1927). But the majority repeatedly considers\nprecisely such claims. See, e.g., ante, at 26\u201329 (consider\u00ad\ning significant matters not raised below); ante, at 34\u201336\n(same).\n   Second, a hornbook Rule 60(b)(5) principle, which the\nCourt mentions, ante, at 10, is that the party seeking\nrelief from a judgment or order \u201cbears the burden of estab\u00ad\nlishing that a significant change in circumstances war\u00ad\nrants\u201d that relief. Rufo, 502 U. S., at 383 (emphasis\nadded); cf. Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools\nv. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 249 (1991) (party moving for\nrelief from judgment must make a \u201csufficient showing\u201d of\nchange in circumstances). But the Court does not apply\nthat principle. See, e.g., ante, at 30\u201331, and n. 22 (holding\nthat movants potentially win because of failure of record\nto show that English-learning problems do not stem from\ncauses other than funding); see also ante, at 26\u201327 (criti\u00ad\ncizing lower courts for failing to consider argument not\nmade).\n   Third, the Court ignores the well-established distinction\nbetween a Rule 60(b)(5) request to modify an order and a\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequest to set an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside\u2014a\ndistinction that this Court has previously emphasized. Cf.\nRufo, supra, at 389, n. 12 (emphasizing that \u201cwe do not\nhave before us the question whether the entire decree\nshould be vacated\u201d). Courts normally do the latter only if\nthe \u201cparty\u201d seeking \u201cto have\u201d the \u201cdecree set aside en\u00ad\ntirely\u201d shows \u201cthat the decree has served its purpose, and\nthere is no longer any need for the injunction.\u201d 12 J.\nMoore et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a760.47 [2][c] (3d ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Moore). Instead of applying the distinc\u00ad\ntion, the majority says that the Court of Appeals \u201cstrayed\u201d\nwhen it referred to situations in which changes justified\nsetting an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside as \u201c \u2018likely\nrare.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 14.\n   Fourth, the Court says nothing about the well\u00ad\nestablished principle that a party moving under Rule\n60(b)(5) for relief that amounts to having a \u201cdecree set\naside entirely\u201d must show both (1) that the decree\u2019s objects\nhave been \u201cattained,\u201d Frew, 540 U. S., at 442, and (2) that\nit is unlikely, in the absence of the decree, that the unlaw\u00ad\nful acts it prohibited will again occur. This Court so held\nin Dowell, a case in which state defendants sought relief\nfrom a school desegregation decree on the ground that the\ndistrict was presently operating in compliance with the\nEqual Protection Clause. The Court agreed with the\ndefendants that \u201ca finding by the District Court that the\nOklahoma City School District was being operated in\ncompliance with . . . the Equal Protection Clause\u201d was\nindeed relevant to the question whether relief was appro\u00ad\npriate. 498 U. S., at 247. But the Court added that, to\nshow entitlement to relief, the defendants must also show\nthat \u201cit was unlikely that the [school board] would return\nto its former ways.\u201d Ibid. Only then would the \u201cpurposes\nof the desegregation litigation ha[ve] been fully achieved.\u201d\nIbid. The principle, as applicable here, simply under\u00ad\nscores petitioners\u2019 failure to show that the \u201cchanges\u201d to\n22                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich they pointed were sufficient to warrant entirely\nsetting aside the original court judgment.\n   Fifth, the majority mentions, but fails to apply, the basic\nRule 60(b)(5) principle that a party cannot dispute the\nlegal conclusions of the judgment from which relief is\nsought. A party cannot use a Rule 60(b)(5) motion as a\nsubstitute for an appeal, say, by attacking the legal rea\u00ad\nsoning underlying the original judgment or by trying to\nshow that the facts, as they were originally, did not then\njustify the order\u2019s issuance. Browder v. Director, Dept. of\nCorrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978); United\nStates v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 119 (1932) (party\ncannot claim that injunction could not lawfully have been\napplied \u201cto the conditions that existed at its making\u201d).\nNor can a party require a court to retrace old legal ground,\nsay, by re-making or rejustifying its original \u201cconstitu\u00ad\ntional decision every time an effort [is] made to enforce or\nmodify\u201d an order. Rufo, supra, at 389\u2013390 (internal quo\u00ad\ntation marks omitted); see also Frew, supra, at 438 (reject\u00ad\ning argument that federal court lacks power to enforce an\norder \u201cunless the court first identifies, at the enforcement\nstage, a violation of federal law\u201d).\n   Here, the original judgment rested upon a finding that\nthe State had failed to provide Nogales with adequate\nfunding \u201cresources,\u201d Castaneda, 648 F. 2d, at 1010, in\nviolation of subsection (f)\u2019s \u201cappropriate action\u201d require\u00ad\nment. How then can the Court fault the lower courts for\nfirst and foremost seeking to determine whether Arizona\nhad developed a plan that would provide Nogales with\nadequate funding resources? How can it criticize the\nlower courts for having \u201cinsulated the policies embedded\nin the order . . . from challenge and amendment,\u201d ante, at\n16, for having failed to appreciate that \u201cfunding is simply\na means, not the end\u201d of the statutory requirement, ante,\nat 18, and for having misperceived \u201cthe nature of the\nobligation imposed by the\u201d Act, ante, at 23?

Railway Employees, 364 U. S., at 647.\n   Sixth, the Court mentions, but fails to apply, the well\u00ad\nsettled legal principle that appellate courts, including this\nCourt, review district court denials of Rule 60(b) motions\n(of the kind before us) for abuse of discretion. See\nBrowder, supra, at 263, n. 7; Railway Employees, supra, at\n648\u2013650. A reviewing court must not substitute its judg\u00ad\nment for that of the district court. See National Hockey\nLeague v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U. S. 639,\n642 (1976) (per curiam); see also Calderon v. Thompson,\n523 U. S. 538, 567\u2013568 (1998) (SOUTER, J., dissenting)\n(\u201c[A] high degree of deference to the court exercising dis\u00ad\ncretionary authority is the hallmark of [abuse of discre\u00ad\ntion] review\u201d). Particularly where, as here, entitlement to\nrelief depends heavily upon fact-related determinations,\nthe power to review the district court\u2019s decision \u201cought\nseldom to be called into action,\u201d namely only in the rare\ninstance where the Rule 60(b) standard \u201cappears to have\nbeen misapprehended or grossly misapplied.\u201d Cf. Univer\u00ad\nsal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 490\u2013491 (1951).\nThe Court\u2019s bare assertion that a court abuses its discre\u00ad\ntion when it fails to order warranted relief, ante, at 10,\nfails to account for the deference due to the District\nCourt\u2019s decision.\n   I have just described Rule 60(b)(5) standards that con\u00ad\ncern (1) the obligation (or lack of obligation) upon a court\nto take account of considerations the parties do not raise;\n24                     HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(2) burdens of proof; (3) the distinction between setting\naside and modifying a judgment; (4) the need to show that\na decree\u2019s basic objectives have been attained; (5) the\nimportance of not requiring relitigation of previously\nlitigated matters; and (6) abuse of discretion review. Does\nthe Court intend to ignore one or more of these standards\nor to apply them differently in cases involving what it calls\n\u201cinstitutional reform litigation\u201d?\n   If so, the Court will find no support for its approach in\nthe cases to which it refers, namely Rufo, Milliken, and\nFrew. Rufo involved a motion to modify a complex court\u00ad\nmonitor-supervised decree designed to prevent overcrowd\u00ad\ning in a local jail. The Court stressed the fact that the\nmodification did not involve setting aside the entire de\u00ad\ncree. 502 U. S., at 389, n. 12. It made clear that the party\nseeking relief from an institutional injunction \u201cbears the\nburden of establishing that a significant change in circum\u00ad\nstances warrants\u201d that relief. Id., at 383. And it rejected\nthe argument that a reviewing court must determine, in\nevery case, whether an ongoing violation of federal law\nexists. Id., at 389, 390, and n. 12 (refusing to require a\nnew \u201c \u2018constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made\nto enforce or modify\u2019 \u201d a judgment or decree (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Frew addressed the question whether the Eleventh\nAmendment permits a federal district court to enforce a\nconsent decree against state officials seeking to bring the\nState into compliance with federal law. 540 U. S., at 434\u2013\n435. The Court unanimously held that it does; and in\ndoing so, the Court rejected the State\u2019s alternative argu\u00ad\nment that a federal court may only enforce such an order\nif it \u201cfirst identifies . . . a violation of federal law\u201d existing\nat the time that enforcement is sought. Id., at 438.\nRather, the Court explained that \u201c \u2018federal courts are not\nreduced to\u2019 \u201d entering judgments or orders \u201c \u2018and hoping for\ncompliance,\u2019 \u201d id., at 440, but rather retain the power to\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nenforce judgments in order \u201cto ensure that . . . the objects\u201d\nof the court order are met, id., at 442. It also emphasized,\nlike Dowell, that relief is warranted only when \u201cthe objects\nof the decree have been attained.\u201d 540 U. S., at 442.\n   What of Milliken? Milliken involved direct review\n(rather than a motion for relief) of a district court\u2019s order\nrequiring the Detroit school system to implement a host of\nremedial programs, including counseling and special\nreading instruction, aimed at schoolchildren previously\nrequired to attend segregated schools. 433 U. S., at 269,\n272. The Court said that a court decree must aim at\n\u201celiminating a condition\u201d that violates federal law or\nwhich \u201cflow[s] from\u201d such a \u201cviolation.\u201d Id., at 282. And it\nunanimously found that the remedy at issue was lawful.\n   These cases confirm the unfortunate fact that the Court\nhas failed fully to apply the six essential principles that I\nhave mentioned. If the Court does not intend any such\nmodifications of these traditional standards, then, as I\nshall show, it must affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\nBut if it does intend to modify them, as stated or in appli\u00ad\ncation, it now applies a new set of new rules that are not\nfaithful to our cases and which will create the dangerous\npossibility that orders, judgments, and decrees long final\nor acquiesced in, will be unwarrantedly subject to perpet\u00ad\nual challenge, offering defendants unjustifiable opportuni\u00ad\nties endlessly to relitigate underlying violations with the\nburden of proof imposed once again upon the plaintiffs.\n   I recognize that the Court\u2019s decision, to a degree, reflects\none side of a scholarly debate about how courts should\nproperly handle decrees in \u201cinstitutional reform litiga\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Compare, in general, R. Sandler & D. Schoenbrod,\nDemocracy by Decree: What Happens When Courts Run\nGovernment (2003), with, e.g., Chayes, The Role of the\nJudge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281,\n1307\u20131309 (1976). But whatever the merits of that de\u00ad\nbate, this case does not involve the kind of \u201cinstitutional\n26                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlitigation\u201d that most commonly lies at its heart. See, e.g.,\nM. Feeley & E. Rubin, Judicial Policy Making and the\nModern State: How the Courts Reformed America\u2019s Pris\u00ad\nons (1998); but see ante, at 10, n. 3.\n   The case does not involve schools, prisons, or mental\nhospitals that have failed to meet basic constitutional\nstandards. See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U. S., at 240\u2013241. It\ndoes not involve a comprehensive judicial decree that\ngoverns the running of a major institution. See, e.g.,\nHutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 683\u2013684 (1978). It does\nnot involve a highly detailed set of orders. See, e.g.,\nRamos v. Lamm, 639 F. 2d 559, 585\u2013586 (CA10 1980). It\ndoes not involve a special master charged with the task of\nsupervising a complex decree that will gradually bring a\nlarge institution into compliance with the law. See, e.g.,\nRuiz v. Estelle, 679 F. 2d 1115, 1160\u20131161 (CA5 1982).\nRather, it involves the more common complaint that a\nstate or local government has failed to meet a federal\nstatutory requirement. See, e.g., Concilio de Salud Inte\u00ad\ngral de Loiza, Inc. v. P\u00e9rez-Perdomo, 551 F. 3d 10, 16 (CA1\n2008); Association of Community Orgs. for Reform Now v.\nEdgar, 56 F. 3d 791, 797\u2013798 (CA7 1995); John B. v.\nMenke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2475088\"><a href=\"/opinion/2475088/john-b-v-menke/\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It\ninvolves a court imposition of a fine upon the State due to\nits lengthy failure to take steps to comply. See, e.g., Hook\nv. Arizona Dept. of Corrections, 107 F. 3d 1397, 1404 (CA9\n1997); Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F. 3d 1347, 1360 (CA5\n1995). And it involves court orders that leave the State\nfree to pursue the English-learning program of its choice\nwhile insisting only that the State come up with a funding\nplan that is rationally related to the program it chooses.\nThis case is more closely akin to Goldberg v. Kelly, 397\nU. S. 254 (1970) (in effect requiring legislation to fund\nwelfare-related \u201cdue process\u201d hearings); cf. id., at 277\u2013279\n(Black, J., dissenting), than it is to the school busing cases\nthat followed Brown v.

Supp. 2d, at 1165. In\nthe opinions below, I can find no misapplication of the\nlegal standards relevant to this case. To the contrary, the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 opinion is true to the record and fair to\nthe decision of the District Court. And the majority is\nwrong to conclude otherwise.\n                             III\n   If the Court\u2019s criticism of the lower courts cannot rest\nupon what they did do, namely examine directly whether\nArizona had produced a rational funding program, it must\nrest upon what it believes they did not do, namely ade\u00ad\nquately consider the other changes in English-learning\ninstruction, administration, and the like to which petition\u00ad\ners referred. Indeed, the Court must believe this, for it\norders the lower courts, on remand, to conduct a \u201cproper\nexamination\u201d of \u201cfour important factual and legal changes\nthat may warrant the granting of relief from the judg\u00ad\nment:\u201d (1) the \u201cadoption of a new . . . instructional meth\u00ad\nodology\u201d for teaching English; (2) \u201cCongress\u2019 enactment\u201d of\nthe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.

The\nCourt of Appeals, too, in its opinion acknowledged that the\ndispute \u201cmay finally be nearing resolution.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at\n1180.\n   But, at the same time, the District Court noted that\n\u201cmany of the new standards are still evolving.\u201d 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1160. It found that \u201cit would be premature\nto make an assessment of some of these changes.\u201d Ibid.\nAnd it held that, all in all, the changes were not yet suffi\u00ad\ncient to warrant relief. Id., at 1167. The Court of Appeals\nupheld the findings and conclusions as within the discre\u00ad\ntionary powers of the District Court, adding that the\nevidence showing that significantly more students were\ncompleting the program was \u201cnot reliable.\u201d 516 F. 3d, at\n1157. What \u201cfurther factual findings,\u201d ante, at 25, are\nneeded? As I have explained, the District Court was not\nobligated to relitigate the case. See supra, at 21\u201322. And\nit did find that \u201cthe State has changed its primary model\u201d\nof English-learning instruction \u201cto structured English\nimmersion.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161. How can the ma\u00ad\njority conclude that \u201cfurther factual findings\u201d are neces\u00ad\nsary?\n   Perhaps the majority does not mean to suggest that the\nlower courts failed properly to examine these changes in\nteaching methods. Perhaps it means to express its belief\nthat the lower courts reached the wrong conclusion. After\nall, the Court refers to a \u201cdocumented, academic support\n30                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfor the view that\u201d structured English immersion \u201cis sig\u00ad\nnificantly more effective than bilingual education.\u201d Ante,\nat 24.\n   It is difficult to see how the majority can substitute its\njudgment for the District Court\u2019s judgment on this ques\u00ad\ntion, however, for that judgment includes a host of sub\u00ad\nsidiary fact-related determinations that warrant defer\u00ad\nence. Railway Employees, 364 U. S., at 647\u2013648 (\u201cWhere\nthere is . . . a balance of imponderables there must be\nwide discretion in the District Court\u201d). And, despite con\u00ad\nsiderable evidence showing improvement, there was also\nconsiderable evidence the other way, evidence that sup\u00ad\nported the District Court\u2019s view that it would be \u201cprema\u00ad\nture\u201d to set aside the judgment of violation.\n   The methodological change was introduced in Arizona in\nlate 2000, and in Nogales it was a work in progress, \u201c[t]o\none degree or another,\u201d as of June 2005. Tr. 10 (Jan. 12,\n2007); ante, at 25. As of 2006, the State\u2019s newest struc\u00ad\ntured English immersion models had not yet taken effect.\nTr. 138 (Jan. 17, 2007) (\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to hopefully\nput down some models for districts to choose from\u201d). The\nState had adopted its new assessment test only the previ\u00ad\nous year. App. 164\u2013165. The testimony about the extent\nto which Nogales had adopted the new teaching system\nwas unclear and conflicting. Compare Tr. 96 (Jan. 9,\n2007) with Tr. 10 (Jan. 12, 2007). And, most importantly,\nthere was evidence that the optimistic improvement in the\nnumber of students completing the English-learning pro\u00ad\ngram was considerably overstated. See Tr. 37 (Jan. 18,\n2007) (stating that the assessment test used in 2005 and\n2006, when dramatic improvements had been reported,\nwas significantly less \u201crigorous\u201d and consequently had\nbeen replaced). The State\u2019s own witnesses were unable\nfirmly to conclude that the new system had so far pro\u00ad\nduced significantly improved results. Tr. 112\u2013113 (Jan.\n11, 2007) (stating that \u201cat some point\u201d it would be possible\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Given the underlying\nfactual disputes (about, e.g., the reliability of the testing\nmethod), how can this Court now hold that the District\nCourt, and the appellate court that affirmed its conclu\u00ad\nsions, were legally wrong?\n                              B\n   The second change that the Court says the lower courts\nshould properly \u201cexamine\u201d is the \u201cenactment\u201d of the No\nChild Left Behind Act. Ante, at 25. The Court concedes,\nhowever, that both courts did address the only argument\nabout that \u201cenactment\u201d that the petitioners made, namely,\nthat \u201ccompliance\u201d with that new law automatically consti\u00ad\ntutes compliance with subsection (f)\u2019s \u201c \u2018appropriate ac\u00ad\ntion\u2019 \u201d requirement. Ante, at 26; see also, e.g., App. 73\n(arguing that the new law \u201cpreempts\u201d subsection (f)). And\nthe Court today agrees (as do I) that the lower courts\nproperly rejected that argument. Ante, at 26.\n   Instead, the Court suggests that the lower courts\nwrongly failed to take account of four other ways in which\nthe new Act is \u201cprobative,\u201d namely (1) its prompting \u201csig\u00ad\nnificant structural and programming\u201d changes, (2) its\nincreases in \u201cfederal funding,\u201d (3) \u201cits assessment and\nreporting requirements,\u201d and (4) its \u201cshift in federal edu\u00ad\ncation policy.\u201d Ante, at 26\u201328. In fact, the lower courts\ndid take account of the changes in structure, program\u00ad\nming, and funding (including federal funding) relevant to\nthe English-learning program in Nogales and elsewhere in\nthe State. See Part III\u2013A, supra; Parts III\u2013C and III\u2013D,\ninfra. But, I agree with the Court that the District Court\ndid not explicitly relate its discussion to the new Act nor\n32                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndid it take account of what the majority calls a \u201cshift in\nfederal education policy.\u201d Ante, at 28.\n  The District Court failed to do what the Court now\ndemands for one simple reason. No one (with the possible\nexception of the legislators, who hint at the matter in their\nreply brief filed in this Court) has ever argued that the\nDistrict Court should take account of any such \u201cchange.\u201d\nBut see ante, at 26, and n. 12.\n  As I have explained, see supra, at 19\u201320, it is well\u00ad\nestablished that a district court rarely commits legal error\nwhen it fails to take account of a \u201cchange\u201d that no one\ncalled to its attention or fails to reply to an argument that\nno one made. See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U. S., at 249 (party\nseeking relief from judgment must make a \u201csufficient\nshowing\u201d). A district court must construe fairly the argu\u00ad\nments made to it; but it is not required to conjure up\nquestions never squarely presented. That the Court of\nAppeals referred to an argument resembling the Court\u2019s\nnew assertion does not change the underlying legal fact.\nThe District Court committed no legal error in failing to\nconsider it. The Court of Appeals could properly reach the\nsame conclusion. And the Government, referring to the\nargument here, does not ask for reversal or remand on\nthat, or on any other, basis.\n  That is not surprising, since the lower courts have con\u00ad\nsistently and explicitly held that \u201cflexibility cannot be\nused to relieve the moving party of its burden to establish\nthat\u201d dissolution is warranted. Thompson v. United States\nDept. of Housing and Urban Development, 220 F. 3d 241,\n248 (CA4 2000); Marshall v. Board of Ed., Bergenfield,\nN. J., 575 F. 2d 417, 423\u2013424 (CA3 1978). There is no\nbasis for treating this case in this respect as somehow\nexceptional, particularly since publicly available docu\u00ad\nments indicate that, in any event, Nogales is not \u201c \u2018reach\u00ad\ning its own goals under Title III\u2019 \u201d of the Act.

Again,\nthe Court cannot mean that the lower courts failed to\n\u201cexamine\u201d these arguments, for the District Court heard\nextensive evidence on the matter. The Court itself refers\nto some (but only some) of the evidence introduced on this\npoint, namely the testimony of Kelt Cooper, the former\nNogales district superintendent, who said that his admin\u00ad\nistrative policies had \u201c \u2018ameliorated or eliminated many of\nthe most glaring inadequacies\u2019 \u201d in Nogales\u2019 program. Ibid.\nThe Court also refers to the District Court\u2019s and Court of\nAppeals\u2019 conclusions about the matter. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1160 (\u201cThe success or failure of the children of\u201d Nogales\n\u201cshould not depend on\u201d \u201cone person\u201d); 516 F. 3d, at 1156\u2013\n1157 (recognizing that Nogales had achieved \u201creforms\nwith limited resources\u201d but also pointing to evidence show\u00ad\ning that \u201cthere are still significant resource constraints,\u201d\nand affirming the District Court\u2019s similar conclusion).\n   Rather the Court claims that the lower courts improp\u00ad\nerly \u201cdiscounted\u201d this evidence. Ante, at 30. But what\ndoes the Court mean by \u201cdiscount\u201d? It cannot mean that\nthe lower courts failed to take account of the possibility\nthat these changes \u201cmight have brought Nogales[\u2019]\u201d pro\u00ad\ngram into \u201ccompliance\u201d with subsection (f).

FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave given significantly more weight to the changes, i.e.,\nthe Court disagrees with the lower courts\u2019 conclusion\nabout the likely effect these changes will have on the\nsuccess of Nogales\u2019 English-learning programs (hence, on\nthe need for the judgment and orders to remain in effect).\n   It is difficult to understand the legal basis for the\nCourt\u2019s disagreement about this fact-related matter. The\nevidence before the District Court was mixed. It consisted\nof some evidence showing administrative reform and\nmanagerial improvement in Nogales. Ante, at 29\u201330. At\nthe same time other evidence, to which the Court does not\nrefer, shows that these reforms did not come close to cur\u00ad\ning the problem. The record shows, for example, that the\ngraduation rate in 2005 for English-learning students\n(59%) was significantly below the average for all students\n(75%). App. 195. It shows poor performance by English\u00ad\nlearning students, compared with English-speaking stu\u00ad\ndents, on Arizona\u2019s content-based standardized tests. See\nAppendix A, infra. This was particularly true at Nogales\u2019\nsole high school\u2014which Arizona ranked 575th out of its\n629 schools on an educational department survey, 516\nF. 3d, at 1159\u2014where only 28% of ELL students passed\nthose standardized tests. Ibid.\n   The record also contains testimony from Guillermo\nZamudio, who in 2005 succeeded Cooper as Nogales\u2019 su\u00ad\nperintendent, and who described numerous relevant \u201cre\u00ad\nsource-related\u201d deficiencies: Lack of funding meant that\nNogales had to rely upon long-term substitute and \u201cemer\u00ad\ngency certified\u201d teachers without necessary training and\nexperience. Tr. 45 (Jan. 18, 2007). Nogales needed addi\u00ad\ntional funding to hire trained teachers\u2019 aides\u2014a \u201cstrong\ncomponent\u201d of its English-learning program, id., at 47.\nAnd Nogales\u2019 funding needs forced it to pay a starting base\nsalary to its teachers about 14% below the state average,\nmaking it difficult to recruit qualified teachers. Id., at 48.\nFinally, Zamudio said that Nogales\u2019 lack of resources\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwould likely lead in the near future to the cancellation of\ncertain programs, including a remedial reading program,\nid., at 56, and would prevent the school district from\nproviding appropriate class sizes and tutoring, which he\ncharacterized as \u201cessential and necessary for us to be able\nto have our students learn English,\u201d id., at 75\u201378.\n   The District Court, faced with all this evidence, found\nthe management and structural \u201cchange\u201d insufficient to\nwarrant dissolution of its decree. How can the Court say\nthat this conclusion is unreasonable? What is the legal\nbasis for concluding that the District Court acted beyond\nthe scope of its lawful authority?\n   In fact, the Court does not even try to claim that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable. Rather it\nenigmatically says that the District Court made \u201cinsuffi\u00ad\ncient factual findings\u201d to support the conclusion that an\nongoing violation of law exists. Ante, at 31\u201332. By \u201cinsuf\u00ad\nficient,\u201d the Court does not mean nonexistent. See 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1163\u20131164. Nor can it mean that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s findings were skimpy or unreasonable.\nThat court simply drew conclusions on the basis of evi\u00ad\ndence it acknowledged was mixed. Id., at 1160\u20131161.\nWhat is wrong with those findings, particularly if viewed\nwith appropriate deference?\n   At one point the Court says that there \u201care many possi\u00ad\nble causes\u201d of Nogales\u2019 difficulties and that the lower\ncourts failed to \u201ctake into account other variables that\nmay explain\u201d the ongoing deficiencies. Ante, at 32 and\nn. 20. But to find a flaw here is to claim that the plaintiffs\nhave failed to negate the possibility that these other\ncauses, not the State\u2019s resource failures, explain Nogales\u2019\npoor performance. To say this is to ignore well-established\nlaw that accords deference to the District Court\u2019s fact\u00ad\nrelated judgments. See supra, at 22\u201323. The Court\u2019s\nstatements reflect the acknowledgment that the evidence\nbelow was mixed. Given that acknowledgment, it is clear\n36                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\nfinding that petitioners had not shown sufficient \u201cchanged\ncircumstances.\u201d And it was petitioners\u2019 job, as the moving\nparty, to show that compliance with federal law has been\nachieved. Where \u201cother variables\u201d make it difficult to\nconclude that a present violation does or does not exist,\nwhat error does the District Court commit if it concludes\nthat the moving party has failed to satisfy that burden?\n                               D\n  The fourth \u201cchange\u201d that the Court suggests the lower\ncourts did not properly \u201cexamine\u201d consists of an \u201coverall\nincrease in the education funding available in Nogales.\u201d\nAnte, at 32. Again, the Court is wrong to suggest that the\nDistrict Court failed fully to examine the matter, for de\u00ad\nspite the Court\u2019s assertions to the contrary, it made a\nnumber of \u201cup-to-date factual findings,\u201d ante, at 33, on the\nmatter, see 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161\u20131164. Those findings\nreflect that the State had developed an educational plan\nthat raised the \u201cbase level amount\u201d for the typical student\nfrom $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to $3,570 in 2006 (in con\u00ad\nstant 2006 dollars), ante, at 32, n. 21; and that plan in\u00ad\ncreased the additional (i.e., \u201cweighted\u201d) amount that would\nbe available per English-learning student from $182 to\n$349 (in 2006 dollars). The State contended that this new\nplan, with its explanation of how the money needed would\nbe forthcoming from federal, as well as from state, sources,\nmet subsection (f)\u2019s requirement for \u201cappropriate action\u201d\n(as related to \u201cresources\u201d) and the District Court\u2019s own\ninsistence upon a mechanism that rationally funded those\nresources. See Appendix B, infra.\n  Once again the Court\u2019s \u201cfactual-finding\u201d criticism seems,\nin context, to indicate its disagreement with the lower\ncourts\u2019 resolution of this argument. That is to say, the\nCourt seems to disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclu\u00ad\nsion that, even with the new funding, the State failed to\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           37\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nshow that adequate resources for English-learning pro\u00ad\ngrams would likely be forthcoming; hence the new plan\nwas not \u201crationally related\u201d to the underlying resource\nproblem.\n   The record, however, adequately supports the District\nCourt\u2019s conclusion. For one thing, the funding plan dem\u00ad\nonstrates that, in 2006, 69% of the available funding was\ntargeted at \u201cbase level\u201d education, see Appendix B, infra,\ni.e., it was funding available to provide students with basic\neducational services like instruction in mathematics,\nscience, and so forth. See Tr. 110 (Jan. 12, 2007). The\nDistrict Court found that this funding likely would not\nbecome available for English-learning programs.\n   How is that conclusion unreasonable? If these funds are\nprovided for the provision of only basic services, how can\nthe majority now decide that a school district\u2014\nparticularly a poor school district like Nogales\u2014would be\nable to cover the additional expenses associated with\nEnglish-learning education while simultaneously manag\u00ad\ning to provide for its students\u2019 basic educational needs?\nIndeed, the idea is particularly impractical when applied\nto a district like Nogales, which has a high percentage of\nstudents who need extra resources. See 516 F. 3d, at 1145\n(approximately 90% of Nogales\u2019 students were, or had\nbeen, enrolled in the English-learning program in 2006).\nWhere the vast majority of students in a district are those\nwho \u201cneed extra help\u201d which \u201ccosts extra money,\u201d it is\ndifficult to imagine where one could find an untapped\nstream of funding that could cover those additional costs.\n   For another thing, the petitioners\u2019 witnesses conceded\nthat the State had not yet determined the likely costs to\nschool districts of teaching English learners using the\nstructured English immersion method. See, e.g., Tr. 199\u2013\n200 (Jan. 17, 2007). The legislators reported that the\nState had recently asked a task force to \u201cdetermine\u201d the\nextra costs associated with implementing the structured\n38                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nEnglish immersion model. Speaker\u2019s Opening Appellate\nBrief in No. 07\u201315603 etc. (CA9), p. 31. But that task\nforce had not yet concluded its work.\n  Further, the District Court doubted that the federal\nportion of the funding identified by the petitioners would\nbe available for English-learning programs. It character\u00ad\nized certain federal grant money, included in the petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 calculus of available funds, as providing only \u201cshort\u00ad\nterm\u201d assistance, 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161. And testimony\nat the evidentiary hearing indicated that some of the\nfunds identified by petitioners might not in fact be avail\u00ad\nable to Nogales\u2019 schools. See Tr. 59\u201361 (Jan. 10, 2007). It\nalso noted that certain funds were restricted, meaning\nthat no particular English-learning child could benefit\nfrom them for more than two years\u2014despite the fact that\nEnglish-learning students in Nogales on average spend\nfour to five years in that program. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1163\u20131164 (Nogales will have to \u201cdilute\u201d the funds pro\u00ad\nvided to cover students who remain English learners for\nmore than two years).\n  Finally, the court pointed to federal law, which imposes\na restriction forbidding the State to use a large portion of\n(what the State\u2019s plan considered to be) available funds in\nthe manner the State proposed, i.e., to \u201csupplant,\u201d or\nsubstitute for, the funds the State would otherwise have\nspent on the program. Id., at 1162; see also 20 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a76314(a)(2)(B), 6315(b)(3), 6613(f), 6825(g). The District\nCourt concluded that the State\u2019s funding plan was in large\npart unworkable in light of this restriction. In reaching\nthis conclusion, the District Court relied in part upon the\ntestimony of Thomas Fagan, a former United States De\u00ad\npartment of Education employee and an \u201cexpert\u201d on this\ntype of federal funding. Fagan testified that Arizona\u2019s\nplan was a \u201c \u2018blatant violation\u2019 \u201d of the relevant laws, which\ncould result in a loss to the State of over $600 million in\nfederal funds\u2014including those federal funds the State\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Supp. 2d,\nat 1163.\n   The Court says that the analysis I have just described,\nand in which the court engaged, amounts to \u201cclear legal\nerror.\u201d Ante, at 33. What error? Where is the error? The\nCourt does say earlier in its opinion that the lower courts\n\u201cshould not\u201d have \u201cdisregarded\u201d the relevant federal (i.e.,\nNo Child Left Behind Act) funds \u201cjust because they are not\nstate funds.\u201d Ante, at 27. But the District Court did not\ndisregard those funds \u201cjust because they are not state\nfunds.\u201d Nor did it \u201cforeclos[e] the possibility that petition\u00ad\ners could\u201d show entitlement to relief by pointing to \u201can\noverall increase in education funding.\u201d Ante, at 33.\nRather, the District Court treated those increased funds\nas potentially unavailable, primarily because their use as\nplanned would violate federal law and would thereby\nthreaten the State with total loss of the stream of federal\nfunding it planned to use. It concluded that the State\u2019s\nplan amounted to \u201c \u2018a blatant violation\u2019 \u201d of federal law, and\nremarked that \u201cthe potential loss of federal funds is sub\u00ad\nstantial.\u201d 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1163. Is there a better\nreason for \u201cdisregard[ing]\u201d those funds?\n   The Court may have other \u201cerrors\u201d in mind as well. It\ndoes say, earlier in its opinion, that some believe that\n\u201cincreased funding alone does not improve student\nachievement,\u201d ante, at 28 (emphasis added), and it refers\nto nine studies that suggest that increased funding does\nnot always help. See ante, at 28\u201331, nn. 17\u201319; see also\nBrief for Education-Policy Scholars as Amici Curiae 7\u201311\n(discussing such scholarship). I do not know what this has\nto do with the matter. But if it is relevant to today\u2019s deci\u00ad\nsion, the Court should also refer to the many studies that\ncast doubt upon the results of the studies it cites. See,\ne.g., H. Ladd & J. Hansen, Making Money Matter: Financ\u00ad\ning America\u2019s Schools 140\u2013147 (1999); Hess, Understand\u00ad\ning Achievement (and Other) Changes Under Chicago\n40                     HORNE v.

Educ.\nRes. 361, 362 (1996).\n  Regardless, the relation of a funding plan to improved\nperformance is not an issue for this Court to decide\nthrough footnote references to the writings of one side of a\ncomplex expert debate. The question here is whether the\nState has shown that its new funding program amounts to\na \u201cchange\u201d that satisfies subsection (f)\u2019s requirement. The\nDistrict Court found it did not. Nothing this Court says\ncasts doubt on the legal validity of that conclusion.\n                                IV\n   The Court\u2019s remaining criticisms are not well founded.\nThe Court, for example, criticizes the Court of Appeals for\nhaving referred to the \u201ccircumstances\u201d that \u201cwarrant Rule\n60(b)(5) relief as \u2018likely rare,\u2019 \u201d for having said the petition\u00ad\ners would have to \u201csweep away\u201d the District Court\u2019s \u201cfund\u00ad\ning determination\u201d in order to prevail, for having spoken\nof the \u201clandscape\u201d as not being \u201cso radically changed as to\njustify relief from judgment without compliance,\u201d and for\nhaving somewhat diminished the \u201cclose[ness]\u201d of its re\u00ad\nview for \u201cfederalism concerns\u201d because the State and its\nBoard of Education \u201cwish the injunction to remain in\nplace.\u201d Ante, at 14\u201315 (first, second, and fourth emphases\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court, however, does not explain the context in\nwhich the Court of Appeals\u2019 statements appeared. That\ncourt used its first phrase (\u201clikely rare\u201d) to refer to the\nparticular kind of modification that the State sought,\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            41\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnamely complete relief from the original judgment, even if\nthe judgment\u2019s objective was not yet fully achieved. 516\nF. 3d, at 1167; cf. Moore \u00a760.47 [2][c]. As far as I know it\nis indeed \u201crare\u201d that \u201ca prior judgment is so undermined\nby later circumstances as to render its continued enforce\u00ad\nment inequitable\u201d even though compliance with the judg\u00ad\nment\u2019s legal determination has not occurred. 516 F. 3d, at\n1167. At least, the Court does not point to other instances\nthat make it common. Uses of the word \u201csweeping\u201d and\n\u201cradica[l] change\u201d in context refer to the deference owed to\nthe District Court\u2019s 2000 legal determination. See id., at\n1168 (describing the 2000 order\u2019s \u201cbasic determination\u201d\nthat English-learning \u201cprograms require substantial state\nfunding in addition to that spent on basic educational\nprogramming\u201d). If there is an error (which I doubt, see\nsupra, at 21\u201323) the error is one of tone, not of law.\n   Nor do I see any legal error that could have made a\ndifference when the Court of Appeals said it should down\u00ad\nplay the importance of federalism concerns because some\nelements of Arizona\u2019s state government support the judg\u00ad\nment. I do not know the legal basis for the majority\u2019s\nreference to this recalibration of judicial distance as \u201cflatly\nincorrect,\u201d but, if it is wrong, I still do not see how recali\u00ad\nbrating the recalibration could matter.\n   In sum, the majority\u2019s decision to set aside the lower\ncourt decisions rests upon (1) a mistaken effort to drive a\nwedge between (a) review of funding plan changes and (b)\nreview of changes that would bring the State into compli\u00ad\nance with federal law, Part I, supra; (2) a misguided at\u00ad\ntempt to show that the lower courts applied the wrong\nlegal standards, Part II, supra; (3) a mistaken belief that\nthe lower courts made four specific fact-based errors, Part\nIII, supra; and (4) a handful of minor criticisms, Part IV,\nsupra and this page. By tracing each of these criticisms to\nits source in the record, I have tried to show that each is\nunjustified. Whether taken separately or together, they\n42                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncannot warrant setting aside the Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision.\n                             V\n   As a totally separate matter, the Court says it is \u201cun\u00ad\nclear\u201d whether the District Court improperly ordered\nstatewide injunctive relief instead of confining that relief\nto Nogales. And it orders the District Court to vacate the\ninjunction \u201cinsofar as it extends beyond Nogales\u201d unless\nthe court finds that \u201cArizona is violating\u201d subsection (f)\n\u201con a statewide basis.\u201d Ante, at 36.\n   What is the legal support for this part of the majority\u2019s\nopinion? Prior to the appearance of this case in this Court,\nno one asked for that modification. Nothing in the law, as\nfar as I know, makes the relief somehow clearly erroneous.\nIndeed, as the majority recognizes, the reason that the\ninjunction runs statewide is that the State of Arizona, the\ndefendant in the litigation, asked the Court to enter that\nrelief. The State pointed in support to a state constitu\u00ad\ntional provision requiring educational uniformity. See\nante, at 35. There is no indication that anyone disputed\nwhether the injunction should have statewide scope. A\nstatewide program harmed Nogales\u2019 students, App. 13\u201314,\n\u00b6\u00b640, 42; and the State wanted statewide relief. What in\nthe law makes this relief erroneous?\n   The majority says that the District Court must consider\nthis matter because \u201c[p]etitioners made it clear at oral\nargument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated.\u201d\nAnte, at 34, n. 23. I find the matter less clear. I would\ndirect the reader to the oral argument transcript, which\nreads in part:\n     \u201cMr. Starr: What was entered here in this order,\n     which makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire\n     State funding mechanism has been interfered with by\n     the order. This case started out in Nogales.\n         .          .           .          .        .\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

I think it\n    was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that applied\n    only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State at\u00ad\n    torney general wanted that done.\n    \u201cMr. Starr: But we should be able now to\u2014\n    \u201cJUSTICE SCALIA: But that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s water over the\n    dam. That\u2019s not what this suit is about now.\u201d Tr. of\n    Oral Arg. 26.\nRegardless, what is the legal basis for the Court\u2019s order\ntelling the District Court it must reconsider the matter?\nThere is no clear error. No one has asked the District\nCourt for modification. And the scope of relief is primarily\na question for the District Court. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 15 (1971) (\u201cOnce a\nright and a violation have been shown, the scope of a\ndistrict court\u2019s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is\nbroad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable\nremedies\u201d).\n                             VI\n  As the length of the opinions indicates, this case re\u00ad\nquires us to read a highly detailed record. Members of\nthis Court have reached different conclusions about what\nthat record says. But there is more to the case than that.\n  First, even if one sees this case as simply a technical\nrecord-reading case, the disagreement among us shows\nwhy this Court should ordinarily hesitate to hear cases\nthat require us to do no more than to review a lengthy\nrecord simply to determine whether a lower court\u2019s fact\u00ad\nbased determinations are correct. Cf. Universal Camera,\n340 U. S., at 488 (\u201c[A] court may [not] displace\u201d a \u201cchoice\nbetween two fairly conflicting views, even though the court\nwould justifiably have made a different choice had the\nmatter been before it de novo\u201d); Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.\nLinde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949) (noting\nthe well-settled rule that this court will not \u201cundertake to\nreview concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in\n44                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of\nerror\u201d). In such cases, appellate courts are closer to the\nfray, better able to reach conclusions that are true to the\nrecord, and are more likely to treat trial court determina\u00ad\ntions fairly and with respect\u2014as is clearly so here.\n   Second, insofar as the Court goes beyond the technical\nrecord-based aspects of this case and applies a new review\nframework, it risks problems in future cases. The frame\u00ad\nwork it applies is incomplete and lacks clear legal support\nor explanation. And it will be difficult for lower courts to\nunderstand and to apply that framework, particularly if it\nrests on a distinction between \u201cinstitutional reform litiga\u00ad\ntion\u201d and other forms of litigation. Does the Court mean\nto say, for example, that courts must, on their own, go\nbeyond a party\u2019s own demands and relitigate an underly\u00ad\ning legal violation whenever that party asks for modifica\u00ad\ntion of an injunction? How could such a rule work in\npractice? See supra, at 21\u201323. Does the Court mean to\nsuggest that there are other special, strict pro-defendant\nrules that govern review of district court decisions in\n\u201cinstitutional reform cases\u201d? What precisely are those\nrules? And when is a case an \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d case?\nAfter all, as I have tried to show, see supra, at 18\u201319, the\ncase before us cannot easily be fitted onto the Court\u2019s\nProcrustean \u201cinstitutional reform\u201d bed.\n   Third, the Court may mean its opinion to express an\nattitude, cautioning judges to take care when the enforce\u00ad\nment of federal statutes will impose significant financial\nburdens upon States. An attitude, however, is not a rule\nof law. Nor does any such attitude point towards vacating\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion here. The record makes\nclear that the District Court did take care. See supra, at\n15. And the Court of Appeals too proceeded with care,\nproducing a detailed opinion that is both true to the record\nand fair to the lower court and to the parties\u2019 submissions\nas well. I do not see how this Court can now require lower\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The case\nconcerns the rights of Spanish-speaking students, attend\u00ad\ning public school near the Mexican border, to learn Eng\u00ad\nlish in order to live their lives in a country where English\nis the predominant language. In a Nation where nearly 47\nmillion people (18% of the population) speak a language\nother than English at home, U. S. Dept. of Commerce,\nEconomics and Statistics Admin., Census Bureau, Census\n2000 Brief: Language Use and English-Speaking Ability 2\n(Oct. 2003), it is important to ensure that those children,\nwithout losing the cultural heritage embodied in the lan\u00ad\nguage of their birth, nonetheless receive the English\u00ad\nlanguage tools they need to participate in a society where\nthat second language \u201cserves as the fundamental medium\nof social interaction\u201d and democratic participation.\nRodr\u00edguez, Language and Participation, 94 Cal. L. Rev.\n687, 693 (2006). In that way linguistic diversity can com\u00ad\nplement and support, rather than undermine, our democ\u00ad\nratic institutions. Id., at 688.\n   At least, that is what Congress decided when it set\nfederal standards that state officials must meet. In doing\nso, without denying the importance of the role of state and\nlocal officials, it also created a role for federal judges,\nincluding judges who must see that the States comply\nwith those federal standards. Unfortunately, for reasons I\nhave set forth, see Part II, supra, the Court\u2019s opinion will\nmake it more difficult for federal courts to enforce those\nfederal standards. Three decades ago, Congress put this\nstatutory provision in place to ensure that our Nation\u2019s\nschool systems will help non-English-speaking schoolchil\u00ad\ndren overcome the language barriers that might hinder\ntheir participation in our country\u2019s schools, workplaces,\n46                   HORNE v.
