Argued April 21, 2009\u2014Decided June 25, 2009\nAfter escorting 13-year-old Savana Redding from her middle school\n  classroom to his office, Assistant Principal Wilson showed her a day\n  planner containing knives and other contraband. She admitted own\n  ing the planner, but said that she had lent it to her friend Marissa\n  and that the contraband was not hers. He then produced four pre\n  scription-strength, and one over-the-counter, pain relief pills, all of\n  which are banned under school rules without advance permission.\n  She denied knowledge of them, but Wilson said that he had a report\n  that she was giving pills to fellow students. She denied it and agreed\n  to let him search her belongings. He and Helen Romero, an adminis\n  trative assistant, searched Savana\u2019s backpack, finding nothing. Wil\n  son then had Romero take Savana to the school nurse\u2019s office to\n  search her clothes for pills. After Romero and the nurse, Peggy\n  Schwallier, had Savana remove her outer clothing, they told her to\n  pull her bra out and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her un\n  derpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.\n  No pills were found. Savana\u2019s mother filed suit against petitioner\n  school district (Safford), Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier, alleging\n  that the strip search violated Savana\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\n  Claiming qualified immunity, the individuals (hereinafter petition\n  ers) moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the\n  motion, finding that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and\n  the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed. Following the protocol for evalu\n  ating qualified immunity claims, see Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194,\n  200, the court held that the strip search was unjustified under the\n  Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set\n  out in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325. It then applied the test\n2         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    for qualified immunity. Finding that Savana\u2019s right was clearly es\n    tablished at the time of the search, it reversed the summary judg\n    ment as to Wilson, but affirmed as to Schwallier and Romero because\n    they were not independent decisionmakers.\nHeld:\n    1. The search of Savana\u2019s underwear violated the Fourth Amend\n ment. Pp. 3\u201311.\n       (a) For school searches, \u201cthe public interest is best served by a\n Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of\n probable cause.\u201d T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 341. Under the resulting rea\n sonable suspicion standard, a school search \u201cwill be permissible . . .\n when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives\n of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex\n of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d Id., at 342. The re\n quired knowledge component of reasonable suspicion for a school ad\n ministrator\u2019s evidence search is that it raise a moderate chance of\n finding evidence of wrongdoing. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Wilson had sufficient suspicion to justify searching Savana\u2019s\n backpack and outer clothing. A week earlier, a student, Jordan, had\n told the principal and Wilson that students were bringing drugs and\n weapons to school and that he had gotten sick from some pills. On\n the day of the search, Jordan gave Wilson a pill that he said came\n from Marissa. Learning that the pill was prescription strength, Wil\n son called Marissa out of class and was handed the day planner.\n Once in his office, Wilson, with Romero present, had Marissa turn\n out her pockets and open her wallet, producing, inter alia, an over\n the-counter pill that Marissa claimed was Savana\u2019s. She also denied\n knowing about the day planner\u2019s contents. Wilson did not ask her\n when she received the pills from Savana or where Savana might be\n hiding them. After a search of Marissa\u2019s underwear by Romero and\n Schwallier revealed no additional pills, Wilson called Savana into his\n office. He showed her the day planner and confirmed her relation\n ship with Marissa. He knew that the girls had been identified as\n part of an unusually rowdy group at a school dance, during which al\n cohol and cigarettes were found in the girls\u2019 bathroom. He had other\n reasons to connect them with this contraband, for Jordan had told\n the principal that before the dance, he had attended a party at Sa\n vana\u2019s house where alcohol was served. Thus, Marissa\u2019s statement\n that the pills came from Savana was sufficiently plausible to warrant\n suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution. A student\n who is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills is rea\n sonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in her back\n pack. Looking into Savana\u2019s bag, in her presence and in the relative\n privacy of Wilson\u2019s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthan Romero\u2019s subsequent search of her outer clothing. Pp. 5\u20138.\n      (c) Because the suspected facts pointing to Savana did not indi\ncate that the drugs presented a danger to students or were concealed\nin her underwear, Wilson did not have sufficient suspicion to warrant\nextending the search to the point of making Savana pull out her un\nderwear. Romero and Schwallier said that they did not see anything\nwhen Savana pulled out her underwear, but a strip search and its\nFourth Amendment consequences are not defined by who was looking\nand how much was seen. Savana\u2019s actions in their presence neces\nsarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both\nsubjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy\nsupport the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, re\nquiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authori\nties for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings. Sa\nvana\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy is inherent in her account of\nit as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating. The reasonable\nness of her expectation is indicated by the common reaction of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability in\ntensifies the exposure\u2019s patent intrusiveness. Its indignity does not\noutlaw the search, but it does implicate the rule that \u201cthe search [be]\n\u2018reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d T. L. O., supra, at 341. Here, the\ncontent of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion. Be\ncause Wilson knew that the pills were common pain relievers, he\nmust have known of their nature and limited threat and had no rea\nson to suspect that large amounts were being passed around or that\nindividual students had great quantities. Nor could he have sus\npected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear.\nWhen suspected facts must support the categorically extreme intru\nsiveness of a search down to an adolescent\u2019s body, petitioners\u2019 general\nbelief that students hide contraband in their clothing falls short; a\nreasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will suc\nceed. Nondangerous school contraband does not conjure up the spec\nter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence of such be\nhavior at the school; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested that\nSavana was doing that, and the search of Marissa yielded nothing.\nWilson also never determined when Marissa had received the pills\nfrom Savana; had it been a few days before, that would weigh heavily\nagainst any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the\npills on her person, much less in her underwear. Pp. 8\u201311.\n   2. Although the strip search violated Savana\u2019s Fourth Amendment\nrights, petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are protected from\nliability by qualified immunity because \u201cclearly established law [did]\nnot show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Pearson\n4         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

O., be seen as justifiably related to the cir\n    cumstances, but lower court cases viewing school strip searches dif\n    ferently are numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dis\n    senting opinions, to counsel doubt about the clarity with which the\n    right was previously stated.

APRIL REDDING\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 25, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The issue here is whether a 13-year-old student\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment right was violated when she was subjected to\na search of her bra and underpants by school officials\nacting on reasonable suspicion that she had brought for\nbidden prescription and over-the-counter drugs to school.\nBecause there were no reasons to suspect the drugs pre\nsented a danger or were concealed in her underwear, we\nhold that the search did violate the Constitution, but\nbecause there is reason to question the clarity with which\nthe right was established, the official who ordered the\nunconstitutional search is entitled to qualified immunity\nfrom liability.\n                             I\n  The events immediately prior to the search in question\nbegan in 13-year-old Savana Redding\u2019s math class at\nSafford Middle School one October day in 2003. The assis\ntant principal of the school, Kerry Wilson, came into the\nroom and asked Savana to go to his office. There, he\nshowed her a day planner, unzipped and open flat on his\ndesk, in which there were several knives, lighters, a per\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanent marker, and a cigarette. Wilson asked Savana\nwhether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that a\nfew days before she had lent it to her friend, Marissa\nGlines. Savana stated that none of the items in the plan\nner belonged to her.\n  Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription\nstrength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter\nblue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflam\nmation but banned under school rules without advance\npermission. He asked Savana if she knew anything about\nthe pills. Savana answered that she did not. Wilson then\ntold Savana that he had received a report that she was\ngiving these pills to fellow students; Savana denied it and\nagreed to let Wilson search her belongings. Helen Ro\nmero, an administrative assistant, came into the office,\nand together with Wilson they searched Savana\u2019s back\npack, finding nothing.\n  At that point, Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana\nto the school nurse\u2019s office to search her clothes for pills.\nRomero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, asked Savana to\nremove her jacket, socks, and shoes, leaving her in stretch\npants and a T-shirt (both without pockets), which she was\nthen asked to remove. Finally, Savana was told to pull\nher bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out\nthe elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts\nand pelvic area to some degree. No pills were found.\n  Savana\u2019s mother filed suit against Safford Unified\nSchool District #1, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for\nconducting a strip search in violation of Savana\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment rights. The individuals (hereinafter petition\ners) moved for summary judgment, raising a defense of\nqualified immunity. The District Court for the District of\nArizona granted the motion on the ground that there was\nno Fourth Amendment violation, and a panel of the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. 504 F. 3d 828 (2007).\n  A closely divided Circuit sitting en banc, however, re\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nversed. Following the two-step protocol for evaluating\nclaims of qualified immunity, see Saucier v. Katz, 533\nU. S. 194, 200 (2001), the Ninth Circuit held that the strip\nsearch was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test\nfor searches of children by school officials set out in New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985). 531 F. 3d 1071,\n1081\u20131087 (2008). The Circuit then applied the test for\nqualified immunity, and found that Savana\u2019s right was\nclearly established at the time of the search: \u201c \u2018[t]hese\nnotions of personal privacy are \u201cclearly established\u201d in\nthat they inhere in all of us, particularly middle school\nteenagers, and are inherent in the privacy component of\nthe Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription against unreason\nable searches.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1088\u20131089 (quoting Brannum v.\nOverton Cty. School Bd., 516 F. 3d 489, 499 (CA6 2008)).\nThe upshot was reversal of summary judgment as to\nWilson, while affirming the judgments in favor of Schwal\nlier, the school nurse, and Romero, the administrative\nassistant, since they had not acted as independent deci\nsionmakers. 531 F. 3d, at 1089.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), and now\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment \u201cright of the people to be secure\nin their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and\nseizures\u201d generally requires a law enforcement officer to\nhave probable cause for conducting a search. \u201cProbable\ncause exists where \u2018the facts and circumstances within [an\nofficer\u2019s] knowledge and of which [he] had reasonably\ntrustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an\noffense has been or is being committed,\u201d Brinegar v.\nUnited States, 338 U. S. 160, 175\u2013176 (1949) (quoting\nCarroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)), and\nthat evidence bearing on that offense will be found in the\n4      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nplace to be searched.\n  In T. L. O., we recognized that the school setting \u201cre\nquires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit\nactivity needed to justify a search,\u201d 469 U. S., at 340, and\nheld that for searches by school officials \u201ca careful balanc\ning of governmental and private interests suggests that\nthe public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment\nstandard of reasonableness that stops short of probable\ncause,\u201d id., at 341. We have thus applied a standard of\nreasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school\nadministrator\u2019s search of a student, id., at 342, 345, and\nhave held that a school search \u201cwill be permissible in its\nscope when the measures adopted are reasonably related\nto the objectives of the search and not excessively intru\nsive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction,\u201d id., at 342.\n  A number of our cases on probable cause have an im\nplicit bearing on the reliable knowledge element of rea\nsonable suspicion, as we have attempted to flesh out the\nknowledge component by looking to the degree to which\nknown facts imply prohibited conduct, see, e.g., Adams v.\nWilliams, 407 U. S. 143, 148 (1972); id., at 160, n. 9 (Mar\nshall, J., dissenting), the specificity of the information\nreceived, see, e.g., Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410,\n416\u2013417 (1969), and the reliability of its source, see, e.g.,\nAguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, 114 (1964). At the end of\nthe day, however, we have realized that these factors\ncannot rigidly control, Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 230\n(1983), and we have come back to saying that the stan\ndards are \u201cfluid concepts that take their substantive con\ntent from the particular contexts\u201d in which they are being\nassessed. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696\n(1996).\n  Perhaps the best that can be said generally about the\nrequired knowledge component of probable cause for a law\nenforcement officer\u2019s evidence search is that it raise a \u201cfair\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprobability,\u201d Gates, 462 U. S., at 238, or a \u201csubstantial\nchance,\u201d id., at 244, n. 13, of discovering evidence of crimi\nnal activity. The lesser standard for school searches could\nas readily be described as a moderate chance of finding\nevidence of wrongdoing.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  In this case, the school\u2019s policies strictly prohibit the\nnonmedical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school\ngrounds, including \u201c \u2018[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter\ndrug, except those for which permission to use in school\nhas been granted pursuant to Board policy.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 128a.1 A week before Savana was searched,\nanother student, Jordan Romero (no relation of the\nschool\u2019s administrative assistant), told the principal and\nAssistant Principal Wilson that \u201ccertain students were\nbringing drugs and weapons on campus,\u201d and that he had\nbeen sick after taking some pills that \u201che got from a\nclassmate.\u201d App. 8a. On the morning of October 8, the\nsame boy handed Wilson a white pill that he said Marissa\nGlines had given him. He told Wilson that students were\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 When the object of a school search is the enforcement of a school\n\nrule, a valid search assumes, of course, the rule\u2019s legitimacy. But the\nlegitimacy of the rule usually goes without saying as it does here. The\nCourt said plainly in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 342, n. 9\n(1985), that standards of conduct for schools are for school administra\ntors to determine without second-guessing by courts lacking the experi\nence to appreciate what may be needed. Except in patently arbitrary\ninstances, Fourth Amendment analysis takes the rule as a given, as it\nobviously should do in this case. There is no need here either to explain\nthe imperative of keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons\nfor the school\u2019s rule banning all drugs, no matter how benign, without\nadvance permission. Teachers are not pharmacologists trained to\nidentify pills and powders, and an effective drug ban has to be enforce\nable fast. The plenary ban makes sense, and there is no basis to claim\nthat the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming\nof the rule it was aimed at enforcing.\n6       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nplanning to take the pills at lunch.\n  Wilson learned from Peggy Schwallier, the school nurse,\nthat the pill was Ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by\nprescription. Wilson then called Marissa out of class.\nOutside the classroom, Marissa\u2019s teacher handed Wilson\nthe day planner, found within Marissa\u2019s reach, containing\nvarious contraband items. Wilson escorted Marissa back\nto his office.\n  In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested\nMarissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet.\nMarissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a\nrazor blade. Wilson asked where the blue pill came from,\nand Marissa answered, \u201c \u2018I guess it slipped in when she\ngave me the IBU 400s.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 13a. When Wilson asked\nwhom she meant, Marissa replied, \u201c \u2018Savana Redding.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. Wilson then enquired about the day planner and its\ncontents; Marissa denied knowing anything about them.\nWilson did not ask Marissa any followup questions to\ndetermine whether there was any likelihood that Savana\npresently had pills: neither asking when Marissa received\nthe pills from Savana nor where Savana might be hiding\nthem.\n  Schwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill,\nbut information provided through a poison control hotline2\nindicated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an anti\ninflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available\nover the counter.

Their conver\nsation established that Savana and Marissa were on\nfriendly terms: while she denied knowledge of the contra\nband, Savana admitted that the day planner was hers and\nthat she had lent it to Marissa. Wilson had other reports\nof their friendship from staff members, who had identified\nSavana and Marissa as part of an unusually rowdy group\nat the school\u2019s opening dance in August, during which\nalcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls\u2019 bathroom.\nWilson had reason to connect the girls with this contra\nband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero had told the\nprincipal that before the dance, he had been at a party at\nSavana\u2019s house where alcohol was served. Marissa\u2019s\nstatement that the pills came from Savana was thus suffi\nciently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was\ninvolved in pill distribution.\n   This suspicion of Wilson\u2019s was enough to justify a search\nof Savana\u2019s backpack and outer clothing.3 If a student is\nreasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is\nreasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and\nin the carryall that has become an item of student uniform\nin most places today. If Wilson\u2019s reasonable suspicion of\npill distribution were not understood to support searches\nof outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any\nsearch worth making. And the look into Savana\u2019s bag, in\nher presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson\u2019s office,\nwas not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero\u2019s\nsubsequent search of her outer clothing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 There is no question here that justification for the school officials\u2019\n\nsearch was required in accordance with the T. L. O. standard of reason\nable suspicion, for it is common ground that Savana had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy covering the personal things she chose to carry in\nher backpack, cf. 469 U. S., at 339, and that Wilson\u2019s decision to look\nthrough it was a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amend\nment.\n8      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana\u2019s\nclaim that extending the search at Wilson\u2019s behest to the\npoint of making her pull out her underwear was constitu\ntionally unreasonable. The exact label for this final step\nin the intrusion is not important, though strip search is a\nfair way to speak of it. Romero and Schwallier directed\nSavana to remove her clothes down to her underwear, and\nthen \u201cpull out\u201d her bra and the elastic band on her under\npants. Id., at 23a. Although Romero and Schwallier\nstated that they did not see anything when Savana fol\nlowed their instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, we\nwould not define strip search and its Fourth Amendment\nconsequences in a way that would guarantee litigation\nabout who was looking and how much was seen. The very\nfact of Savana\u2019s pulling her underwear away from her\nbody in the presence of the two officials who were able to\nsee her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to\nsome degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal\nexpectations of personal privacy support the treatment of\nsuch a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct\nelements of justification on the part of school authorities\nfor going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.\n   Savana\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy against such\na search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing,\nfrightening, and humiliating. The reasonableness of her\nexpectation (required by the Fourth Amendment stan\ndard) is indicated by the consistent experiences of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulner\nability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure.\nSee Brief for National Association of Social Workers et al.\nas Amici Curiae 6\u201314; Hyman & Perone, The Other Side of\nSchool Violence: Educator Policies and Practices that may\nContribute to Student Misbehavior, 36 J.

Wilson knew beforehand that the pills\nwere prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter\nnaproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil,\nor one Aleve.4 He must have been aware of the nature and\nlimited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for,\nand while just about anything can be taken in quantities\nthat will do real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 AnAdvil tablet, caplet, or gel caplet, contains 200 mg of ibuprofen.\nSee Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, Dietary\nSupplements, and Herbs 674 (28th ed. 2006). An Aleve caplet contains\n200 mg naproxen and 20 mg sodium. See id., at 675.\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat large amounts of the drugs were being passed around,\nor that individual students were receiving great numbers\nof pills.\n   Nor could Wilson have suspected that Savana was\nhiding common painkillers in her underwear. Petitioners\nsuggest, as a truth universally acknowledged, that \u201cstu\ndents . . . hid[e] contraband in or under their clothing,\u201d\nReply Brief for Petitioners 8, and cite a smattering of\ncases of students with contraband in their underwear, id.,\nat 8\u20139. But when the categorically extreme intrusiveness\nof a search down to the body of an adolescent requires\nsome justification in suspected facts, general background\npossibilities fall short; a reasonable search that extensive\ncalls for suspicion that it will pay off. But nondangerous\nschool contraband does not raise the specter of stashes in\nintimate places, and there is no evidence in the record of\nany general practice among Safford Middle School stu\ndents of hiding that sort of thing in underwear; neither\nJordan nor Marissa suggested to Wilson that Savana was\ndoing that, and the preceding search of Marissa that\nWilson ordered yielded nothing. Wilson never even de\ntermined when Marissa had received the pills from Sa\nvana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh\nheavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana\npresently had the pills on her person, much less in her\nunderwear.\n   In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that\npointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the\nstudents from the power of the drugs or their quantity,\nand any reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills\nin her underwear. We think that the combination of these\ndeficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.\n   In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the\nassistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his\nmotive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school\nand protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough. Parents are known to overreact to protect their\nchildren from danger, and a school official with responsi\nbility for safety may tend to do the same. The difference is\nthat the Fourth Amendment places limits on the official,\neven with the high degree of deference that courts must\npay to the educator\u2019s professional judgment.\n   We do mean, though, to make it clear that the T. L. O.\nconcern to limit a school search to reasonable scope re\nquires the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of\nresort to underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing\nbefore a search can reasonably make the quantum leap\nfrom outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate\nparts. The meaning of such a search, and the degradation\nits subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intru\nsive in a category of its own demanding its own specific\nsuspicions.\n                               IV\n   A school official searching a student is \u201centitled to quali\nfied immunity where clearly established law does not show\nthat the search violated the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pearson\nv.

S., at 342, and as\n12     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have just said at some length, the intrusiveness of the\nstrip search here cannot be seen as justifiably related to\nthe circumstances. But we realize that the lower courts\nhave reached divergent conclusions regarding how the\nT. L. O. standard applies to such searches.\n  A number of judges have read T. L. O. as the en banc\nminority of the Ninth Circuit did here. The Sixth Circuit\nupheld a strip search of a high school student for a drug,\nwithout any suspicion that drugs were hidden next to her\nbody. Williams v. Ellington, 936 F. 2d 881, 882\u2013883, 887\n(1991). And other courts considering qualified immunity\nfor strip searches have read T. L. O. as \u201ca series of ab\nstractions, on the one hand, and a declaration of seeming\ndeference to the judgments of school officials, on the\nother,\u201d Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Ed., 115 F. 3d 821,\n828 (CA11 1997) (en banc), which made it impossible \u201cto\nestablish clearly the contours of a Fourth Amendment\nright . . . [in] the wide variety of possible school settings\ndifferent from those involved in T. L. O.\u201d itself. Ibid. See\nalso Thomas v. Roberts, 323 F. 3d 950 (CA11 2003) (grant\ning qualified immunity to a teacher and police officer who\nconducted a group strip search of a fifth grade class when\nlooking for a missing $26).\n  We think these differences of opinion from our own are\nsubstantial enough to require immunity for the school\nofficials in this case. We would not suggest that entitle\nment to qualified immunity is the guaranteed product of\ndisuniform views of the law in the other federal, or state,\ncourts, and the fact that a single judge, or even a group of\njudges, disagrees about the contours of a right does not\nautomatically render the law unclear if we have been\nclear. That said, however, the cases viewing school strip\nsearches differently from the way we see them are numer\nous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting\nopinions, to counsel doubt that we were sufficiently clear\nin the prior statement of law.

The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore\naffirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is\nremanded for consideration of the Monell claim.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985), the\nCourt established a two-step inquiry for determining the\nreasonableness of a school official\u2019s decision to search a\nstudent. First, the Court explained, the search must be\n\u201c \u2018justified at its inception\u2019 \u201d by the presence of \u201creasonable\ngrounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evi\ndence that the student has violated or is violating either\nthe law or the rules of the school.\u201d Id., at 342. Second, the\nsearch must be \u201cpermissible in its scope,\u201d which is\nachieved \u201cwhen the measures adopted are reasonably\nrelated to the objectives of the search and not excessively\nintrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n    Nothing the Court decides today alters this basic\nframework. It simply applies T. L. O. to declare unconsti\ntutional a strip search of a 13-year-old honors student that\nwas based on a groundless suspicion that she might be\nhiding medicine in her underwear. This is, in essence, a\ncase in which clearly established law meets clearly outra\ngeous conduct. I have long believed that \u201c \u2018[i]t does not\nrequire a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude\nsearch of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitu\ntional rights of some magnitude.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 382, n. 25\n2       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(quoting Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F. 2d 91, 92\u201393 (CA7 1980)).\nThe strip search of Savana Redding in this case was both\nmore intrusive and less justified than the search of the\nstudent\u2019s purse in T. L. O. Therefore, while I join Parts I\u2013\nIII of the Court\u2019s opinion, I disagree with its decision to\nextend qualified immunity to the school official who au\nthorized this unconstitutional search.\n   The Court reaches a contrary conclusion about qualified\nimmunity based on the fact that various Courts of Appeals\nhave adopted seemingly divergent views about T. L. O.\u2019s\napplication to strip searches. Ante, at 12. But the clarity\nof a well-established right should not depend on whether\njurists have misread our precedents. And while our cases\nhave previously noted the \u201cdivergence of views\u201d among\ncourts in deciding whether to extend qualified immunity,\ne.g., Pearson v. Callahan, (2009) 555 U. S., ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 20) (noting the unsettled constitutionality of the so\ncalled \u201cconsent-once-removed\u201d doctrine); Wilson v. Layne,\n526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999) (considering conflicting views on\nthe constitutionality of law enforcement\u2019s practice of al\nlowing the media to enter a private home to observe and\nfilm attempted arrests), we have relied on that considera\ntion only to spare officials from having \u201c \u2018to predict the\nfuture course of constitutional law,\u2019 \u201d Id., at 617 (quoting\nProcunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 562 (1978); empha\nsis added). In this case, by contrast, we chart no new\nconstitutional path. We merely decide whether the deci\nsion to strip search Savana Redding, on these facts, was\nprohibited under T. L. O.

But I\nalso agree with JUSTICE STEVENS, ante, at 1\u20132, that our\nopinion in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985),\n\u201cclearly established\u201d the law governing this case.\n   Fellow student Marissa Glines, caught with pills in her\npocket, accused Redding of supplying them. App. 13a.\nAsked where the blue pill among several white pills in\nGlines\u2019s pocket came from, Glines answered: \u201cI guess it\nslipped in when she gave me the IBU 400s.\u201d Ibid. Asked\nnext \u201cwho is she?\u201d, Glines responded: \u201cSavana Redding.\u201d\nIbid. As the Court observes, ante, at 6, 10, no followup\nquestions were asked. Wilson did not test Glines\u2019s accusa\ntion for veracity by asking Glines when did Redding give\nher the pills, where, for what purpose. Any reasonable\nsearch for the pills would have ended when inspection of\nRedding\u2019s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing.\nWilson had no cause to suspect, based on prior experience\nat the school or clues in this case, that Redding had hid\nden pills\u2014containing the equivalent of two Advils or one\nAleve\u2014in her underwear or body. To make matters\nworse, Wilson did not release Redding, to return to class\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nor to go home, after the search. Instead, he made her sit\non a chair outside his office for over two hours. At no\npoint did he attempt to call her parent. Abuse of authority\nof that order should not be shielded by official immunity.\n   In contrast to T. L. O., where a teacher discovered a\nstudent smoking in the lavatory, and where the search\nwas confined to the student\u2019s purse, the search of Redding\ninvolved her body and rested on the bare accusation of\nanother student whose reliability the Assistant Principal\nhad no reason to trust. The Court\u2019s opinion in T. L. O.\nplainly stated the controlling Fourth Amendment law: A\nsearch ordered by a school official, even if \u201cjustified at its\ninception,\u201d crosses the constitutional boundary if it be\ncomes \u201cexcessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of\nthe student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d 469 U. S., at\n342 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Here, \u201cthe nature of the [supposed] infraction,\u201d the slim\nbasis for suspecting Savana Redding, and her \u201cage and\nsex,\u201d ibid., establish beyond doubt that Assistant Principal\nWilson\u2019s order cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s\nopinion in T. L. O. Wilson\u2019s treatment of Redding was\nabusive and it was not reasonable for him to believe that\nthe law permitted it.

This deep\nintrusion into the administration of public schools exem\nplifies why the Court should return to the common-law\ndoctrine of in loco parentis under which \u201cthe judiciary was\nreluctant to interfere in the routine business of school\nadministration, allowing schools and teachers to set and\nenforce rules and to maintain order.\u201d Morse v.

REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nofficials are \u201centitled to make an assessment of the situa\ntion in light of [this] specialized training and familiarity\nwith the customs of the [school].\u201d See Arvizu, supra, at\n276.\n   Here, petitioners had reasonable grounds to suspect\nthat Redding was in possession of prescription and non\nprescription drugs in violation of the school\u2019s prohibition of\nthe \u201cnon-medical use, possession, or sale of a drug\u201d on\nschool property or at school events. 531 F. 3d 1071, 1076\n(CA9 2008) (en banc); see also id., at 1107 (Hawkins, J.,\ndissenting) (explaining that the school policy defined\n\u201cdrugs\u201d to include \u201c \u2018[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter\ndrug, except those for which permission to use in school\nhas been granted\u2019 \u201d). As an initial matter, school officials\nwere aware that a few years earlier, a student had become\n\u201cseriously ill\u201d and \u201cspent several days in intensive care\u201d\nafter ingesting prescription medication obtained from a\nclassmate. App. 10a. Fourth Amendment searches do not\noccur in a vacuum; rather, context must inform the judi\ncial inquiry. See Cortez, supra, at 417\u2013418. In this in\nstance, the suspicion of drug possession arose at a middle\nschool that had \u201ca history of problems with students using\nand distributing prohibited and illegal substances on\ncampus.\u201d App. 7a, 10a.\n   The school\u2019s substance-abuse problems had not abated\nby the 2003\u20132004 school year, which is when the chal\nlenged search of Redding took place. School officials had\nfound alcohol and cigarettes in the girls\u2019 bathroom during\nthe first school dance of the year and noticed that a group\nof students including Redding and Marissa Glines smelled\nof alcohol. Ibid. Several weeks later, another student,\nJordan Romero, reported that Redding had hosted a party\nbefore the dance where she served whiskey, vodka, and\ntequila. Id., at 8a, 11a.

At that meeting,\nRomero admitted that \u201ccertain students were bringing\ndrugs and weapons on campus.\u201d Id., at 8a, 11a. One week\nlater, Romero handed the assistant principal a white pill\nthat he said he had received from Glines. Id., at 11a. He\nreported \u201cthat a group of students [were] planning on\ntaking the pills at lunch.\u201d Ibid.\n   School officials justifiably took quick action in light of\nthe lunchtime deadline. The assistant principal took the\npill to the school nurse who identified it as prescription\nstrength 400-mg Ibuprofen. Id., at 12a. A subsequent\nsearch of Glines and her belongings produced a razor\nblade, a Naproxen 200-mg pill, and several Ibuprofen 400\nmg pills. Id., at 13a. When asked, Glines claimed that\nshe had received the pills from Redding. Ibid. A search of\nRedding\u2019s planner, which Glines had borrowed, then un\ncovered \u201cseveral knives, several lighters, a cigarette, and a\npermanent marker.\u201d Id., at 12a, 14a, 22a. Thus, as the\nmajority acknowledges, ante, at 7, the totality of relevant\ncircumstances justified a search of Redding for pills.1\n                            B\n  The remaining question is whether the search was\nreasonable in scope. Under T. L.

App. 14a. But her denial alone does not negate the\nreasonable suspicion held by school officials. See New Jersey v.\nT. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 345 (1985) (finding search reasonable even\nthough \u201cT. L.

The majority concludes that the school officials\u2019\nsearch of Redding\u2019s underwear was not \u201c \u2018reasonably re\nlated in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place,\u2019 \u201d see ante, at 8\u201311, notwith\nstanding the officials\u2019 reasonable suspicion that Redding\n\u201cwas involved in pill distribution,\u201d ante, at 7. According to\nthe majority, to be reasonable, this school search required\na showing of \u201cdanger to the students from the power of the\ndrugs or their quantity\u201d or a \u201creason to suppose that [Red\nding] was carrying pills in her underwear.\u201d Ante, at 10.\nEach of these additional requirements is an unjustifiable\ndeparture from bedrock Fourth Amendment law in the\nschool setting, where this Court has heretofore read the\nFourth Amendment to grant considerable leeway to school\nofficials. Because the school officials searched in a loca\ntion where the pills could have been hidden, the search\nwas reasonable in scope under T. L. O.\n                                     1\n  The majority finds that \u201csubjective and reasonable\nsocietal expectations of personal privacy support . . .\ntreat[ing]\u201d this type of search, which it labels a \u201cstrip\nsearch,\u201d as \u201ccategorically distinct, requiring distinct ele\nments of justification on the part of school authorities for\ngoing beyond a search of clothing and belongings.\u201d Ante,\nat 8.2 Thus, in the majority\u2019s view, although the school\nofficials had reasonable suspicion to believe that Redding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Like the dissent below, \u201cI would reserve the term \u2018strip search\u2019 for a\n\nsearch that required its subject to fully disrobe in view of officials.\u201d 531\nF. 3d 1071, 1091, n. 1 (CA9 2008) (opinion of Hawkins, J.). The distinc\ntion between a strip search and the search at issue in this case may be\nslight, but it is a distinction that the law has drawn. See, e.g., Sandin\nv. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 475 (1995) (\u201cThe officer subjected Conner to a\nstrip search, complete with inspection of the rectal area\u201d); Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.

See, e.g., Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295,\n307 (1999) (Police officers \u201cmay inspect passengers\u2019 be\nlongings found in the car that are capable of concealing\nthe object of the search\u201d); Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.

S.\n478, 487 (1985) (search reasonable because \u201cthere is no\nplausible argument that the object of the search could not\nhave been concealed in the packages\u201d); United States v.\nRoss, 456 U. S. 798, 820 (1982) (\u201cA lawful search . . . gen\nerally extends to the entire area in which the object of the\nsearch may be found\u201d).3\n   In keeping with this longstanding rule, the \u201cnature of\nthe infraction\u201d referenced in T. L. O. delineates the proper\nscope of a search of students in a way that is identical to\nthat permitted for searches outside the school\u2014i.e., the\nsearch must be limited to the areas where the object of\nthat infraction could be concealed. See Horton v. Califor\nnia, 496 U. S. 128, 141 (1990) (\u201cPolice with a warrant for a\nrifle may search only places where rifles might be\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)); Ross, supra, at 824\n(\u201c[P]robable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are\nbeing transported in a van will not justify a warrantless\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court has adopted a different standard for searches involving\n\nan \u201cintrusio[n] into the human body.\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384\nU. S. 757, 770 (1966). The search here does not implicate the Court\u2019s\ncases governing bodily intrusions, however, because it did not involve a\n\u201cphysical intrusion, penetrating beneath the skin,\u201d Skinner v. Railway\nLabor Executives\u2019 Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 616 (1989).\n8      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nsearch of a suitcase\u201d). A search of a student therefore is\npermissible in scope under T. L. O. so long as it is objec\ntively reasonable to believe that the area searched could\nconceal the contraband. The dissenting opinion below\ncorrectly captured this Fourth Amendment standard,\nnoting that \u201cif a student brought a baseball bat on campus\nin violation of school policy, a search of that student\u2019s shirt\npocket would be patently unjustified.\u201d 531 F. 3d, at 1104\n(opinion of Hawkins, J.).\n   The analysis of whether the scope of the search here was\npermissible under that standard is straightforward.\nIndeed, the majority does not dispute that \u201cgeneral back\nground possibilities\u201d establish that students conceal \u201ccon\ntraband in their underwear.\u201d Ante, at 10. It acknowledges\nthat school officials had reasonable suspicion to look in\nRedding\u2019s backpack and outer clothing because if \u201cWilson\u2019s\nreasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not under\nstood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it\nwould not justify any search worth making.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nThe majority nevertheless concludes that proceeding any\nfurther with the search was unreasonable. See ante, at 8\u2013\n10; see also ante, at 1 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (\u201cAny reasonable search for the\npills would have ended when inspection of Redding\u2019s\nbackpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing\u201d). But there\nis no support for this conclusion. The reasonable suspicion\nthat Redding possessed the pills for distribution purposes\ndid not dissipate simply because the search of her back\npack turned up nothing. It was eminently reasonable to\nconclude that the backpack was empty because Redding\nwas secreting the pills in a place she thought no one would\nlook. See Ross, supra, at 820 (\u201cContraband goods rarely\nare strewn\u201d about in plain view; \u201cby their very nature such\ngoods must be withheld from public view\u201d).\n   Redding would not have been the first person to conceal\npills in her undergarments.

L. O. test as a license to\nlimit searches based on a judge\u2019s assessment of a particu\nlar school policy. According to the majority, the scope of\nthe search was impermissible because the school official\n\u201cmust have been aware of the nature and limited threat of\nthe specific drugs he was searching for\u201d and because he\n\u201chad no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs\nwere being passed around, or that individual students\nwere receiving great numbers of pills.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310.\nThus, in order to locate a rationale for finding a Fourth\nAmendment violation in this case, the majority retreats\nfrom its observation that the school\u2019s firm no-drug policy\n\u201cmakes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the\nsearch was unreasonable owing to some defect or short\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

This approach directly conflicts\nwith T. L. O. in which the Court was \u201cunwilling to adopt a\nstandard under which the legality of a search is dependent\nupon a judge\u2019s evaluation of the relative importance of\nschool rules.\u201d 469 U. S., at 342, n. 9. Indeed, the Court in\nT. L. O. expressly rejected the proposition that the major\nity seemingly endorses\u2014that \u201csome rules regarding stu\ndent conduct are by nature too \u2018trivial\u2019 to justify a search\nbased upon reasonable suspicion.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at\n343, n. 9 (\u201cThe promulgation of a rule forbidding specified\nconduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of\nschool officials that such conduct is destructive of school\norder or of a proper educational environment.

Had the suspected infraction involved a\nstreet drug, the majority implies that it would have ap\nproved the scope of the search. See ante, at 9 (relying on\nthe \u201climited threat of the specific drugs he was searching\nfor\u201d); ante, at 10 (relying on the limited \u201cpower of the\ndrugs\u201d involved). In effect, then, the majority has replaced\na school rule that draws no distinction among drugs with a\nnew one that does. As a result, a full search of a student\u2019s\nperson for prohibited drugs will be permitted only if the\nCourt agrees that the drug in question was sufficiently\ndangerous. Such a test is unworkable and unsound.\nSchool officials cannot be expected to halt searches based\non the possibility that a court might later find that the\nparticular infraction at issue is not severe enough to war\nrant an intrusive investigation.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 JUSTICE  GINSBURG suggests that requiring Redding to \u201csit on a chair\noutside [the assistant principal\u2019s] office for over two hours\u201d and failing\nto call her parents before conducting the search constitutes an \u201c[a]buse\nof authority\u201d that \u201cshould not be shielded by official immunity.\u201d See\nante, at 1\u20132. But the school was under no constitutional obligation to\ncall Redding\u2019s parents before conducting the search: \u201c[R]easonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least\nintrusive means, because the logic of such elaborate less-restrictive\nalternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise\nof virtually all search-and-seizure powers.\u201d Board of Ed. of Independ\nent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 837\n(2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).

So empowered, schoolteachers and administrators\nhad almost complete discretion to establish and enforce\nthe rules they believed were necessary to maintain control\nover their classrooms. See 2 J.

Argued April 21, 2009\u2014Decided June 25, 2009\nAfter escorting 13-year-old Savana Redding from her middle school\n  classroom to his office, Assistant Principal Wilson showed her a day\n  planner containing knives and other contraband. She admitted own\n  ing the planner, but said that she had lent it to her friend Marissa\n  and that the contraband was not hers. He then produced four pre\n  scription-strength, and one over-the-counter, pain relief pills, all of\n  which are banned under school rules without advance permission.\n  She denied knowledge of them, but Wilson said that he had a report\n  that she was giving pills to fellow students. She denied it and agreed\n  to let him search her belongings. He and Helen Romero, an adminis\n  trative assistant, searched Savana\u2019s backpack, finding nothing. Wil\n  son then had Romero take Savana to the school nurse\u2019s office to\n  search her clothes for pills. After Romero and the nurse, Peggy\n  Schwallier, had Savana remove her outer clothing, they told her to\n  pull her bra out and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her un\n  derpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.\n  No pills were found. Savana\u2019s mother filed suit against petitioner\n  school district (Safford), Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier, alleging\n  that the strip search violated Savana\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\n  Claiming qualified immunity, the individuals (hereinafter petition\n  ers) moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the\n  motion, finding that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and\n  the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed. Following the protocol for evalu\n  ating qualified immunity claims, see Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194,\n  200, the court held that the strip search was unjustified under the\n  Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set\n  out in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325. It then applied the test\n2         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    for qualified immunity. Finding that Savana\u2019s right was clearly es\n    tablished at the time of the search, it reversed the summary judg\n    ment as to Wilson, but affirmed as to Schwallier and Romero because\n    they were not independent decisionmakers.\nHeld:\n    1. The search of Savana\u2019s underwear violated the Fourth Amend\n ment. Pp. 3\u201311.\n       (a) For school searches, \u201cthe public interest is best served by a\n Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of\n probable cause.\u201d T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 341. Under the resulting rea\n sonable suspicion standard, a school search \u201cwill be permissible . . .\n when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives\n of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex\n of the student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d Id., at 342. The re\n quired knowledge component of reasonable suspicion for a school ad\n ministrator\u2019s evidence search is that it raise a moderate chance of\n finding evidence of wrongdoing. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Wilson had sufficient suspicion to justify searching Savana\u2019s\n backpack and outer clothing. A week earlier, a student, Jordan, had\n told the principal and Wilson that students were bringing drugs and\n weapons to school and that he had gotten sick from some pills. On\n the day of the search, Jordan gave Wilson a pill that he said came\n from Marissa. Learning that the pill was prescription strength, Wil\n son called Marissa out of class and was handed the day planner.\n Once in his office, Wilson, with Romero present, had Marissa turn\n out her pockets and open her wallet, producing, inter alia, an over\n the-counter pill that Marissa claimed was Savana\u2019s. She also denied\n knowing about the day planner\u2019s contents. Wilson did not ask her\n when she received the pills from Savana or where Savana might be\n hiding them. After a search of Marissa\u2019s underwear by Romero and\n Schwallier revealed no additional pills, Wilson called Savana into his\n office. He showed her the day planner and confirmed her relation\n ship with Marissa. He knew that the girls had been identified as\n part of an unusually rowdy group at a school dance, during which al\n cohol and cigarettes were found in the girls\u2019 bathroom. He had other\n reasons to connect them with this contraband, for Jordan had told\n the principal that before the dance, he had attended a party at Sa\n vana\u2019s house where alcohol was served. Thus, Marissa\u2019s statement\n that the pills came from Savana was sufficiently plausible to warrant\n suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution. A student\n who is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills is rea\n sonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in her back\n pack. Looking into Savana\u2019s bag, in her presence and in the relative\n privacy of Wilson\u2019s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthan Romero\u2019s subsequent search of her outer clothing. Pp. 5\u20138.\n      (c) Because the suspected facts pointing to Savana did not indi\ncate that the drugs presented a danger to students or were concealed\nin her underwear, Wilson did not have sufficient suspicion to warrant\nextending the search to the point of making Savana pull out her un\nderwear. Romero and Schwallier said that they did not see anything\nwhen Savana pulled out her underwear, but a strip search and its\nFourth Amendment consequences are not defined by who was looking\nand how much was seen. Savana\u2019s actions in their presence neces\nsarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both\nsubjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy\nsupport the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, re\nquiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authori\nties for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings. Sa\nvana\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy is inherent in her account of\nit as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating. The reasonable\nness of her expectation is indicated by the common reaction of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability in\ntensifies the exposure\u2019s patent intrusiveness. Its indignity does not\noutlaw the search, but it does implicate the rule that \u201cthe search [be]\n\u2018reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d T. L. O., supra, at 341. Here, the\ncontent of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion. Be\ncause Wilson knew that the pills were common pain relievers, he\nmust have known of their nature and limited threat and had no rea\nson to suspect that large amounts were being passed around or that\nindividual students had great quantities. Nor could he have sus\npected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear.\nWhen suspected facts must support the categorically extreme intru\nsiveness of a search down to an adolescent\u2019s body, petitioners\u2019 general\nbelief that students hide contraband in their clothing falls short; a\nreasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will suc\nceed. Nondangerous school contraband does not conjure up the spec\nter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence of such be\nhavior at the school; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested that\nSavana was doing that, and the search of Marissa yielded nothing.\nWilson also never determined when Marissa had received the pills\nfrom Savana; had it been a few days before, that would weigh heavily\nagainst any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the\npills on her person, much less in her underwear. Pp. 8\u201311.\n   2. Although the strip search violated Savana\u2019s Fourth Amendment\nrights, petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are protected from\nliability by qualified immunity because \u201cclearly established law [did]\nnot show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Pearson\n4         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

APRIL REDDING\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 25, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The issue here is whether a 13-year-old student\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment right was violated when she was subjected to\na search of her bra and underpants by school officials\nacting on reasonable suspicion that she had brought for\nbidden prescription and over-the-counter drugs to school.\nBecause there were no reasons to suspect the drugs pre\nsented a danger or were concealed in her underwear, we\nhold that the search did violate the Constitution, but\nbecause there is reason to question the clarity with which\nthe right was established, the official who ordered the\nunconstitutional search is entitled to qualified immunity\nfrom liability.\n                             I\n  The events immediately prior to the search in question\nbegan in 13-year-old Savana Redding\u2019s math class at\nSafford Middle School one October day in 2003. The assis\ntant principal of the school, Kerry Wilson, came into the\nroom and asked Savana to go to his office. There, he\nshowed her a day planner, unzipped and open flat on his\ndesk, in which there were several knives, lighters, a per\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanent marker, and a cigarette. Wilson asked Savana\nwhether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that a\nfew days before she had lent it to her friend, Marissa\nGlines. Savana stated that none of the items in the plan\nner belonged to her.\n  Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription\nstrength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter\nblue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflam\nmation but banned under school rules without advance\npermission. He asked Savana if she knew anything about\nthe pills. Savana answered that she did not. Wilson then\ntold Savana that he had received a report that she was\ngiving these pills to fellow students; Savana denied it and\nagreed to let Wilson search her belongings. Helen Ro\nmero, an administrative assistant, came into the office,\nand together with Wilson they searched Savana\u2019s back\npack, finding nothing.\n  At that point, Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana\nto the school nurse\u2019s office to search her clothes for pills.\nRomero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, asked Savana to\nremove her jacket, socks, and shoes, leaving her in stretch\npants and a T-shirt (both without pockets), which she was\nthen asked to remove. Finally, Savana was told to pull\nher bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out\nthe elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts\nand pelvic area to some degree. No pills were found.\n  Savana\u2019s mother filed suit against Safford Unified\nSchool District #1, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for\nconducting a strip search in violation of Savana\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment rights. The individuals (hereinafter petition\ners) moved for summary judgment, raising a defense of\nqualified immunity. The District Court for the District of\nArizona granted the motion on the ground that there was\nno Fourth Amendment violation, and a panel of the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. 504 F. 3d 828 (2007).\n  A closely divided Circuit sitting en banc, however, re\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nversed. Following the two-step protocol for evaluating\nclaims of qualified immunity, see Saucier v. Katz, 533\nU. S. 194, 200 (2001), the Ninth Circuit held that the strip\nsearch was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test\nfor searches of children by school officials set out in New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985). 531 F. 3d 1071,\n1081\u20131087 (2008). The Circuit then applied the test for\nqualified immunity, and found that Savana\u2019s right was\nclearly established at the time of the search: \u201c \u2018[t]hese\nnotions of personal privacy are \u201cclearly established\u201d in\nthat they inhere in all of us, particularly middle school\nteenagers, and are inherent in the privacy component of\nthe Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription against unreason\nable searches.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1088\u20131089 (quoting Brannum v.\nOverton Cty. School Bd., 516 F. 3d 489, 499 (CA6 2008)).\nThe upshot was reversal of summary judgment as to\nWilson, while affirming the judgments in favor of Schwal\nlier, the school nurse, and Romero, the administrative\nassistant, since they had not acted as independent deci\nsionmakers. 531 F. 3d, at 1089.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), and now\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment \u201cright of the people to be secure\nin their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and\nseizures\u201d generally requires a law enforcement officer to\nhave probable cause for conducting a search. \u201cProbable\ncause exists where \u2018the facts and circumstances within [an\nofficer\u2019s] knowledge and of which [he] had reasonably\ntrustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u2019 an\noffense has been or is being committed,\u201d Brinegar v.\nUnited States, 338 U. S. 160, 175\u2013176 (1949) (quoting\nCarroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)), and\nthat evidence bearing on that offense will be found in the\n4      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nplace to be searched.\n  In T. L. O., we recognized that the school setting \u201cre\nquires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit\nactivity needed to justify a search,\u201d 469 U. S., at 340, and\nheld that for searches by school officials \u201ca careful balanc\ning of governmental and private interests suggests that\nthe public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment\nstandard of reasonableness that stops short of probable\ncause,\u201d id., at 341. We have thus applied a standard of\nreasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school\nadministrator\u2019s search of a student, id., at 342, 345, and\nhave held that a school search \u201cwill be permissible in its\nscope when the measures adopted are reasonably related\nto the objectives of the search and not excessively intru\nsive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction,\u201d id., at 342.\n  A number of our cases on probable cause have an im\nplicit bearing on the reliable knowledge element of rea\nsonable suspicion, as we have attempted to flesh out the\nknowledge component by looking to the degree to which\nknown facts imply prohibited conduct, see, e.g., Adams v.\nWilliams, 407 U. S. 143, 148 (1972); id., at 160, n. 9 (Mar\nshall, J., dissenting), the specificity of the information\nreceived, see, e.g., Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410,\n416\u2013417 (1969), and the reliability of its source, see, e.g.,\nAguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, 114 (1964). At the end of\nthe day, however, we have realized that these factors\ncannot rigidly control, Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 230\n(1983), and we have come back to saying that the stan\ndards are \u201cfluid concepts that take their substantive con\ntent from the particular contexts\u201d in which they are being\nassessed. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696\n(1996).\n  Perhaps the best that can be said generally about the\nrequired knowledge component of probable cause for a law\nenforcement officer\u2019s evidence search is that it raise a \u201cfair\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

S., at 238, or a \u201csubstantial\nchance,\u201d id., at 244, n. 13, of discovering evidence of crimi\nnal activity. The lesser standard for school searches could\nas readily be described as a moderate chance of finding\nevidence of wrongdoing.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  In this case, the school\u2019s policies strictly prohibit the\nnonmedical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school\ngrounds, including \u201c \u2018[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter\ndrug, except those for which permission to use in school\nhas been granted pursuant to Board policy.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 128a.1 A week before Savana was searched,\nanother student, Jordan Romero (no relation of the\nschool\u2019s administrative assistant), told the principal and\nAssistant Principal Wilson that \u201ccertain students were\nbringing drugs and weapons on campus,\u201d and that he had\nbeen sick after taking some pills that \u201che got from a\nclassmate.\u201d App. 8a. On the morning of October 8, the\nsame boy handed Wilson a white pill that he said Marissa\nGlines had given him. He told Wilson that students were\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 When the object of a school search is the enforcement of a school\n\nrule, a valid search assumes, of course, the rule\u2019s legitimacy. But the\nlegitimacy of the rule usually goes without saying as it does here. The\nCourt said plainly in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 342, n. 9\n(1985), that standards of conduct for schools are for school administra\ntors to determine without second-guessing by courts lacking the experi\nence to appreciate what may be needed. Except in patently arbitrary\ninstances, Fourth Amendment analysis takes the rule as a given, as it\nobviously should do in this case. There is no need here either to explain\nthe imperative of keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons\nfor the school\u2019s rule banning all drugs, no matter how benign, without\nadvance permission. Teachers are not pharmacologists trained to\nidentify pills and powders, and an effective drug ban has to be enforce\nable fast. The plenary ban makes sense, and there is no basis to claim\nthat the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming\nof the rule it was aimed at enforcing.\n6       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nplanning to take the pills at lunch.\n  Wilson learned from Peggy Schwallier, the school nurse,\nthat the pill was Ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by\nprescription. Wilson then called Marissa out of class.\nOutside the classroom, Marissa\u2019s teacher handed Wilson\nthe day planner, found within Marissa\u2019s reach, containing\nvarious contraband items. Wilson escorted Marissa back\nto his office.\n  In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested\nMarissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet.\nMarissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a\nrazor blade. Wilson asked where the blue pill came from,\nand Marissa answered, \u201c \u2018I guess it slipped in when she\ngave me the IBU 400s.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 13a. When Wilson asked\nwhom she meant, Marissa replied, \u201c \u2018Savana Redding.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. Wilson then enquired about the day planner and its\ncontents; Marissa denied knowing anything about them.\nWilson did not ask Marissa any followup questions to\ndetermine whether there was any likelihood that Savana\npresently had pills: neither asking when Marissa received\nthe pills from Savana nor where Savana might be hiding\nthem.\n  Schwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill,\nbut information provided through a poison control hotline2\nindicated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an anti\ninflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available\nover the counter. At Wilson\u2019s direction, Marissa was then\nsubjected to a search of her bra and underpants by Ro\nmero and Schwallier, as Savana was later on. The search\nrevealed no additional pills.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Poison control centers across the country maintain 24-hour help\n\nhotlines to provide \u201cimmediate access to poison exposure management\ninstructions and information on potential poisons.\u201d American Associa\ntion of Poison Control Centers, online at http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/\nAbout/tabid/74/Default.aspx (all Internet materials as visited June 19,\n2009, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Wilson had other reports\nof their friendship from staff members, who had identified\nSavana and Marissa as part of an unusually rowdy group\nat the school\u2019s opening dance in August, during which\nalcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls\u2019 bathroom.\nWilson had reason to connect the girls with this contra\nband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero had told the\nprincipal that before the dance, he had been at a party at\nSavana\u2019s house where alcohol was served. Marissa\u2019s\nstatement that the pills came from Savana was thus suffi\nciently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was\ninvolved in pill distribution.\n   This suspicion of Wilson\u2019s was enough to justify a search\nof Savana\u2019s backpack and outer clothing.3 If a student is\nreasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is\nreasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and\nin the carryall that has become an item of student uniform\nin most places today. If Wilson\u2019s reasonable suspicion of\npill distribution were not understood to support searches\nof outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any\nsearch worth making. And the look into Savana\u2019s bag, in\nher presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson\u2019s office,\nwas not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero\u2019s\nsubsequent search of her outer clothing.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 There is no question here that justification for the school officials\u2019\n\nsearch was required in accordance with the T. L. O. standard of reason\nable suspicion, for it is common ground that Savana had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy covering the personal things she chose to carry in\nher backpack, cf. 469 U. S., at 339, and that Wilson\u2019s decision to look\nthrough it was a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amend\nment.\n8      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana\u2019s\nclaim that extending the search at Wilson\u2019s behest to the\npoint of making her pull out her underwear was constitu\ntionally unreasonable. The exact label for this final step\nin the intrusion is not important, though strip search is a\nfair way to speak of it. Romero and Schwallier directed\nSavana to remove her clothes down to her underwear, and\nthen \u201cpull out\u201d her bra and the elastic band on her under\npants. Id., at 23a. Although Romero and Schwallier\nstated that they did not see anything when Savana fol\nlowed their instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, we\nwould not define strip search and its Fourth Amendment\nconsequences in a way that would guarantee litigation\nabout who was looking and how much was seen. The very\nfact of Savana\u2019s pulling her underwear away from her\nbody in the presence of the two officials who were able to\nsee her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to\nsome degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal\nexpectations of personal privacy support the treatment of\nsuch a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct\nelements of justification on the part of school authorities\nfor going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.\n   Savana\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy against such\na search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing,\nfrightening, and humiliating. The reasonableness of her\nexpectation (required by the Fourth Amendment stan\ndard) is indicated by the consistent experiences of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulner\nability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure.\nSee Brief for National Association of Social Workers et al.\nas Amici Curiae 6\u201314; Hyman & Perone, The Other Side of\nSchool Violence: Educator Policies and Practices that may\nContribute to Student Misbehavior, 36 J.

The scope will be\npermissible, that is, when it is \u201cnot excessively intrusive in\nlight of the age and sex of the student and the nature of\nthe infraction.\u201d Id., at 342.\n   Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the\ndegree of intrusion. Wilson knew beforehand that the pills\nwere prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter\nnaproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil,\nor one Aleve.4 He must have been aware of the nature and\nlimited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for,\nand while just about anything can be taken in quantities\nthat will do real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 AnAdvil tablet, caplet, or gel caplet, contains 200 mg of ibuprofen.\nSee Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, Dietary\nSupplements, and Herbs 674 (28th ed. 2006). An Aleve caplet contains\n200 mg naproxen and 20 mg sodium. See id., at 675.\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat large amounts of the drugs were being passed around,\nor that individual students were receiving great numbers\nof pills.\n   Nor could Wilson have suspected that Savana was\nhiding common painkillers in her underwear. Petitioners\nsuggest, as a truth universally acknowledged, that \u201cstu\ndents . . . hid[e] contraband in or under their clothing,\u201d\nReply Brief for Petitioners 8, and cite a smattering of\ncases of students with contraband in their underwear, id.,\nat 8\u20139. But when the categorically extreme intrusiveness\nof a search down to the body of an adolescent requires\nsome justification in suspected facts, general background\npossibilities fall short; a reasonable search that extensive\ncalls for suspicion that it will pay off. But nondangerous\nschool contraband does not raise the specter of stashes in\nintimate places, and there is no evidence in the record of\nany general practice among Safford Middle School stu\ndents of hiding that sort of thing in underwear; neither\nJordan nor Marissa suggested to Wilson that Savana was\ndoing that, and the preceding search of Marissa that\nWilson ordered yielded nothing. Wilson never even de\ntermined when Marissa had received the pills from Sa\nvana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh\nheavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana\npresently had the pills on her person, much less in her\nunderwear.\n   In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that\npointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the\nstudents from the power of the drugs or their quantity,\nand any reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills\nin her underwear. We think that the combination of these\ndeficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.\n   In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the\nassistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his\nmotive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school\nand protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough. Parents are known to overreact to protect their\nchildren from danger, and a school official with responsi\nbility for safety may tend to do the same. The difference is\nthat the Fourth Amendment places limits on the official,\neven with the high degree of deference that courts must\npay to the educator\u2019s professional judgment.\n   We do mean, though, to make it clear that the T. L. O.\nconcern to limit a school search to reasonable scope re\nquires the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of\nresort to underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing\nbefore a search can reasonably make the quantum leap\nfrom outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate\nparts. The meaning of such a search, and the degradation\nits subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intru\nsive in a category of its own demanding its own specific\nsuspicions.\n                               IV\n   A school official searching a student is \u201centitled to quali\nfied immunity where clearly established law does not show\nthat the search violated the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pearson\nv. Callahan, 555 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op., at 18). To be\nestablished clearly, however, there is no need that \u201cthe\nvery action in question [have] previously been held unlaw\nful.\u201d Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999).

But even as to\naction less than an outrage, \u201cofficials can still be on notice\nthat their conduct violates established law . . . in novel\nfactual circumstances.\u201d Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 741\n(2002).\n   T. L. O. directed school officials to limit the intrusive\nness of a search, \u201cin light of the age and sex of the student\nand the nature of the infraction,\u201d 469 U. S., at 342, and as\n12     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have just said at some length, the intrusiveness of the\nstrip search here cannot be seen as justifiably related to\nthe circumstances. But we realize that the lower courts\nhave reached divergent conclusions regarding how the\nT. L. O. standard applies to such searches.\n  A number of judges have read T. L. O. as the en banc\nminority of the Ninth Circuit did here. The Sixth Circuit\nupheld a strip search of a high school student for a drug,\nwithout any suspicion that drugs were hidden next to her\nbody. Williams v. Ellington, 936 F. 2d 881, 882\u2013883, 887\n(1991). And other courts considering qualified immunity\nfor strip searches have read T. L. O. as \u201ca series of ab\nstractions, on the one hand, and a declaration of seeming\ndeference to the judgments of school officials, on the\nother,\u201d Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Ed., 115 F. 3d 821,\n828 (CA11 1997) (en banc), which made it impossible \u201cto\nestablish clearly the contours of a Fourth Amendment\nright . . . [in] the wide variety of possible school settings\ndifferent from those involved in T. L. O.\u201d itself. Ibid. See\nalso Thomas v. Roberts, 323 F. 3d 950 (CA11 2003) (grant\ning qualified immunity to a teacher and police officer who\nconducted a group strip search of a fifth grade class when\nlooking for a missing $26).\n  We think these differences of opinion from our own are\nsubstantial enough to require immunity for the school\nofficials in this case. We would not suggest that entitle\nment to qualified immunity is the guaranteed product of\ndisuniform views of the law in the other federal, or state,\ncourts, and the fact that a single judge, or even a group of\njudges, disagrees about the contours of a right does not\nautomatically render the law unclear if we have been\nclear. That said, however, the cases viewing school strip\nsearches differently from the way we see them are numer\nous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting\nopinions, to counsel doubt that we were sufficiently clear\nin the prior statement of law.

S. 658, 694 (1978), a claim the Ninth Circuit did not\naddress. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore\naffirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is\nremanded for consideration of the Monell claim.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985), the\nCourt established a two-step inquiry for determining the\nreasonableness of a school official\u2019s decision to search a\nstudent. First, the Court explained, the search must be\n\u201c \u2018justified at its inception\u2019 \u201d by the presence of \u201creasonable\ngrounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evi\ndence that the student has violated or is violating either\nthe law or the rules of the school.\u201d Id., at 342. Second, the\nsearch must be \u201cpermissible in its scope,\u201d which is\nachieved \u201cwhen the measures adopted are reasonably\nrelated to the objectives of the search and not excessively\nintrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n    Nothing the Court decides today alters this basic\nframework. It simply applies T. L. O. to declare unconsti\ntutional a strip search of a 13-year-old honors student that\nwas based on a groundless suspicion that she might be\nhiding medicine in her underwear. This is, in essence, a\ncase in which clearly established law meets clearly outra\ngeous conduct. I have long believed that \u201c \u2018[i]t does not\nrequire a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude\nsearch of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitu\ntional rights of some magnitude.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 382, n. 25\n2       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(quoting Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F. 2d 91, 92\u201393 (CA7 1980)).\nThe strip search of Savana Redding in this case was both\nmore intrusive and less justified than the search of the\nstudent\u2019s purse in T. L. O. Therefore, while I join Parts I\u2013\nIII of the Court\u2019s opinion, I disagree with its decision to\nextend qualified immunity to the school official who au\nthorized this unconstitutional search.\n   The Court reaches a contrary conclusion about qualified\nimmunity based on the fact that various Courts of Appeals\nhave adopted seemingly divergent views about T. L. O.\u2019s\napplication to strip searches. Ante, at 12. But the clarity\nof a well-established right should not depend on whether\njurists have misread our precedents. And while our cases\nhave previously noted the \u201cdivergence of views\u201d among\ncourts in deciding whether to extend qualified immunity,\ne.g., Pearson v. Callahan, (2009) 555 U. S., ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 20) (noting the unsettled constitutionality of the so\ncalled \u201cconsent-once-removed\u201d doctrine); Wilson v. Layne,\n526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999) (considering conflicting views on\nthe constitutionality of law enforcement\u2019s practice of al\nlowing the media to enter a private home to observe and\nfilm attempted arrests), we have relied on that considera\ntion only to spare officials from having \u201c \u2018to predict the\nfuture course of constitutional law,\u2019 \u201d Id., at 617 (quoting\nProcunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 562 (1978); empha\nsis added). In this case, by contrast, we chart no new\nconstitutional path. We merely decide whether the deci\nsion to strip search Savana Redding, on these facts, was\nprohibited under T. L. O.

But I\nalso agree with JUSTICE STEVENS, ante, at 1\u20132, that our\nopinion in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985),\n\u201cclearly established\u201d the law governing this case.\n   Fellow student Marissa Glines, caught with pills in her\npocket, accused Redding of supplying them. App. 13a.\nAsked where the blue pill among several white pills in\nGlines\u2019s pocket came from, Glines answered: \u201cI guess it\nslipped in when she gave me the IBU 400s.\u201d Ibid. Asked\nnext \u201cwho is she?\u201d, Glines responded: \u201cSavana Redding.\u201d\nIbid. As the Court observes, ante, at 6, 10, no followup\nquestions were asked. Wilson did not test Glines\u2019s accusa\ntion for veracity by asking Glines when did Redding give\nher the pills, where, for what purpose. Any reasonable\nsearch for the pills would have ended when inspection of\nRedding\u2019s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing.\nWilson had no cause to suspect, based on prior experience\nat the school or clues in this case, that Redding had hid\nden pills\u2014containing the equivalent of two Advils or one\nAleve\u2014in her underwear or body. To make matters\nworse, Wilson did not release Redding, to return to class\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

At no\npoint did he attempt to call her parent. Abuse of authority\nof that order should not be shielded by official immunity.\n   In contrast to T. L. O., where a teacher discovered a\nstudent smoking in the lavatory, and where the search\nwas confined to the student\u2019s purse, the search of Redding\ninvolved her body and rested on the bare accusation of\nanother student whose reliability the Assistant Principal\nhad no reason to trust. The Court\u2019s opinion in T. L. O.\nplainly stated the controlling Fourth Amendment law: A\nsearch ordered by a school official, even if \u201cjustified at its\ninception,\u201d crosses the constitutional boundary if it be\ncomes \u201cexcessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of\nthe student and the nature of the infraction.\u201d 469 U. S., at\n342 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Here, \u201cthe nature of the [supposed] infraction,\u201d the slim\nbasis for suspecting Savana Redding, and her \u201cage and\nsex,\u201d ibid., establish beyond doubt that Assistant Principal\nWilson\u2019s order cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s\nopinion in T. L. O. Wilson\u2019s treatment of Redding was\nabusive and it was not reasonable for him to believe that\nthe law permitted it.

As an initial matter, school officials\nwere aware that a few years earlier, a student had become\n\u201cseriously ill\u201d and \u201cspent several days in intensive care\u201d\nafter ingesting prescription medication obtained from a\nclassmate. App. 10a. Fourth Amendment searches do not\noccur in a vacuum; rather, context must inform the judi\ncial inquiry. See Cortez, supra, at 417\u2013418. In this in\nstance, the suspicion of drug possession arose at a middle\nschool that had \u201ca history of problems with students using\nand distributing prohibited and illegal substances on\ncampus.\u201d App. 7a, 10a.\n   The school\u2019s substance-abuse problems had not abated\nby the 2003\u20132004 school year, which is when the chal\nlenged search of Redding took place. School officials had\nfound alcohol and cigarettes in the girls\u2019 bathroom during\nthe first school dance of the year and noticed that a group\nof students including Redding and Marissa Glines smelled\nof alcohol.

At that meeting,\nRomero admitted that \u201ccertain students were bringing\ndrugs and weapons on campus.\u201d Id., at 8a, 11a. One week\nlater, Romero handed the assistant principal a white pill\nthat he said he had received from Glines. Id., at 11a. He\nreported \u201cthat a group of students [were] planning on\ntaking the pills at lunch.\u201d Ibid.\n   School officials justifiably took quick action in light of\nthe lunchtime deadline. The assistant principal took the\npill to the school nurse who identified it as prescription\nstrength 400-mg Ibuprofen. Id., at 12a. A subsequent\nsearch of Glines and her belongings produced a razor\nblade, a Naproxen 200-mg pill, and several Ibuprofen 400\nmg pills. Id., at 13a. When asked, Glines claimed that\nshe had received the pills from Redding. Ibid.

Thus, as the\nmajority acknowledges, ante, at 7, the totality of relevant\ncircumstances justified a search of Redding for pills.1\n                            B\n  The remaining question is whether the search was\nreasonable in scope.

The majority concludes that the school officials\u2019\nsearch of Redding\u2019s underwear was not \u201c \u2018reasonably re\nlated in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place,\u2019 \u201d see ante, at 8\u201311, notwith\nstanding the officials\u2019 reasonable suspicion that Redding\n\u201cwas involved in pill distribution,\u201d ante, at 7. According to\nthe majority, to be reasonable, this school search required\na showing of \u201cdanger to the students from the power of the\ndrugs or their quantity\u201d or a \u201creason to suppose that [Red\nding] was carrying pills in her underwear.\u201d Ante, at 10.\nEach of these additional requirements is an unjustifiable\ndeparture from bedrock Fourth Amendment law in the\nschool setting, where this Court has heretofore read the\nFourth Amendment to grant considerable leeway to school\nofficials. Because the school officials searched in a loca\ntion where the pills could have been hidden, the search\nwas reasonable in scope under T. L. O.\n                                     1\n  The majority finds that \u201csubjective and reasonable\nsocietal expectations of personal privacy support . . .\ntreat[ing]\u201d this type of search, which it labels a \u201cstrip\nsearch,\u201d as \u201ccategorically distinct, requiring distinct ele\nments of justification on the part of school authorities for\ngoing beyond a search of clothing and belongings.\u201d Ante,\nat 8.2 Thus, in the majority\u2019s view, although the school\nofficials had reasonable suspicion to believe that Redding\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Like the dissent below, \u201cI would reserve the term \u2018strip search\u2019 for a\n\nsearch that required its subject to fully disrobe in view of officials.\u201d 531\nF. 3d 1071, 1091, n. 1 (CA9 2008) (opinion of Hawkins, J.). The distinc\ntion between a strip search and the search at issue in this case may be\nslight, but it is a distinction that the law has drawn. See, e.g., Sandin\nv. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 475 (1995) (\u201cThe officer subjected Conner to a\nstrip search, complete with inspection of the rectal area\u201d); Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.

See, e.g., Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295,\n307 (1999) (Police officers \u201cmay inspect passengers\u2019 be\nlongings found in the car that are capable of concealing\nthe object of the search\u201d); Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.

S.\n478, 487 (1985) (search reasonable because \u201cthere is no\nplausible argument that the object of the search could not\nhave been concealed in the packages\u201d); United States v.\nRoss, 456 U. S. 798, 820 (1982) (\u201cA lawful search . . . gen\nerally extends to the entire area in which the object of the\nsearch may be found\u201d).3\n   In keeping with this longstanding rule, the \u201cnature of\nthe infraction\u201d referenced in T. L. O. delineates the proper\nscope of a search of students in a way that is identical to\nthat permitted for searches outside the school\u2014i.e., the\nsearch must be limited to the areas where the object of\nthat infraction could be concealed. See Horton v. Califor\nnia, 496 U. S. 128, 141 (1990) (\u201cPolice with a warrant for a\nrifle may search only places where rifles might be\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)); Ross, supra, at 824\n(\u201c[P]robable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are\nbeing transported in a van will not justify a warrantless\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court has adopted a different standard for searches involving\n\nan \u201cintrusio[n] into the human body.\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384\nU. S. 757, 770 (1966). The search here does not implicate the Court\u2019s\ncases governing bodily intrusions, however, because it did not involve a\n\u201cphysical intrusion, penetrating beneath the skin,\u201d Skinner v. Railway\nLabor Executives\u2019 Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 616 (1989).\n8      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nsearch of a suitcase\u201d). A search of a student therefore is\npermissible in scope under T. L. O. so long as it is objec\ntively reasonable to believe that the area searched could\nconceal the contraband. The dissenting opinion below\ncorrectly captured this Fourth Amendment standard,\nnoting that \u201cif a student brought a baseball bat on campus\nin violation of school policy, a search of that student\u2019s shirt\npocket would be patently unjustified.\u201d 531 F. 3d, at 1104\n(opinion of Hawkins, J.).\n   The analysis of whether the scope of the search here was\npermissible under that standard is straightforward.\nIndeed, the majority does not dispute that \u201cgeneral back\nground possibilities\u201d establish that students conceal \u201ccon\ntraband in their underwear.\u201d Ante, at 10. It acknowledges\nthat school officials had reasonable suspicion to look in\nRedding\u2019s backpack and outer clothing because if \u201cWilson\u2019s\nreasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not under\nstood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it\nwould not justify any search worth making.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nThe majority nevertheless concludes that proceeding any\nfurther with the search was unreasonable. See ante, at 8\u2013\n10; see also ante, at 1 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (\u201cAny reasonable search for the\npills would have ended when inspection of Redding\u2019s\nbackpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing\u201d). But there\nis no support for this conclusion. The reasonable suspicion\nthat Redding possessed the pills for distribution purposes\ndid not dissipate simply because the search of her back\npack turned up nothing. It was eminently reasonable to\nconclude that the backpack was empty because Redding\nwas secreting the pills in a place she thought no one would\nlook. See Ross, supra, at 820 (\u201cContraband goods rarely\nare strewn\u201d about in plain view; \u201cby their very nature such\ngoods must be withheld from public view\u201d).\n   Redding would not have been the first person to conceal\npills in her undergarments.

L. O. test as a license to\nlimit searches based on a judge\u2019s assessment of a particu\nlar school policy. According to the majority, the scope of\nthe search was impermissible because the school official\n\u201cmust have been aware of the nature and limited threat of\nthe specific drugs he was searching for\u201d and because he\n\u201chad no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs\nwere being passed around, or that individual students\nwere receiving great numbers of pills.\u201d Ante, at 9\u201310.\nThus, in order to locate a rationale for finding a Fourth\nAmendment violation in this case, the majority retreats\nfrom its observation that the school\u2019s firm no-drug policy\n\u201cmakes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the\nsearch was unreasonable owing to some defect or short\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

This approach directly conflicts\nwith T. L. O. in which the Court was \u201cunwilling to adopt a\nstandard under which the legality of a search is dependent\nupon a judge\u2019s evaluation of the relative importance of\nschool rules.\u201d 469 U. S., at 342, n. 9. Indeed, the Court in\nT. L. O. expressly rejected the proposition that the major\nity seemingly endorses\u2014that \u201csome rules regarding stu\ndent conduct are by nature too \u2018trivial\u2019 to justify a search\nbased upon reasonable suspicion.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at\n343, n. 9 (\u201cThe promulgation of a rule forbidding specified\nconduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of\nschool officials that such conduct is destructive of school\norder or of a proper educational environment.

Had the suspected infraction involved a\nstreet drug, the majority implies that it would have ap\nproved the scope of the search. See ante, at 9 (relying on\nthe \u201climited threat of the specific drugs he was searching\nfor\u201d); ante, at 10 (relying on the limited \u201cpower of the\ndrugs\u201d involved). In effect, then, the majority has replaced\na school rule that draws no distinction among drugs with a\nnew one that does. As a result, a full search of a student\u2019s\nperson for prohibited drugs will be permitted only if the\nCourt agrees that the drug in question was sufficiently\ndangerous. Such a test is unworkable and unsound.\nSchool officials cannot be expected to halt searches based\non the possibility that a court might later find that the\nparticular infraction at issue is not severe enough to war\nrant an intrusive investigation.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 JUSTICE  GINSBURG suggests that requiring Redding to \u201csit on a chair\noutside [the assistant principal\u2019s] office for over two hours\u201d and failing\nto call her parents before conducting the search constitutes an \u201c[a]buse\nof authority\u201d that \u201cshould not be shielded by official immunity.\u201d See\nante, at 1\u20132. But the school was under no constitutional obligation to\ncall Redding\u2019s parents before conducting the search: \u201c[R]easonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least\nintrusive means, because the logic of such elaborate less-restrictive\nalternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise\nof virtually all search-and-seizure powers.\u201d Board of Ed. of Independ\nent School Dist.

Teachers,\nadministrators, and the local school board are called upon\nboth to \u201cprotect the . . . safety of students and school per\nsonnel\u201d and \u201cmaintain an environment conducive to learn\ning.\u201d Id., at 353 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).\nThey are tasked with \u201cwatch[ing] over a large number of\nstudents\u201d who \u201care inclined to test the outer boundaries of\nacceptable conduct and to imitate the misbehavior of a\npeer if that misbehavior is not dealt with quickly.\u201d Id., at\n352. In such an environment, something as simple as a\n\u201cwater pistol or peashooter can wreak [havoc] until it is\ntaken away.\u201d Ibid. The danger posed by unchecked dis\ntribution and consumption of prescription pills by students\ncertainly needs no elaboration.\n   Judges are not qualified to second-guess the best man\nner for maintaining quiet and order in the school envi\nronment. Such institutional judgments, like those con\ncerning the selection of the best methods for \u201crestrain[ing\nstudents] from assaulting one another, abusing drugs and\nalcohol, and committing other crimes,\u201d id., at 342, n. 9,\n\u201cinvolve a host of policy choices that must be made by\nlocally elected representatives, rather than by federal\njudges interpreting the basic charter of Government for\nthe entire country.\u201d Collins v.

It is a mistake for judges to assume the\nresponsibility for deciding which school rules are impor\ntant enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules\nare not.\n                               3\n   Even if this Court were authorized to second-guess the\nimportance of school rules, the Court\u2019s assessment of the\nimportance of this district\u2019s policy is flawed. It is a crime\nto possess or use prescription-strength Ibuprofen without\na prescription. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u20133406(A)(1)\n(West Supp. 2008) (\u201cA person shall not knowingly . . .\n[p]ossess or use a prescription-only drug unless the person\nobtains the prescription-only drug pursuant to a valid\nprescription of a prescriber who is licensed pursuant to\n[state law]\u201d).5 By prohibiting unauthorized prescription\ndrugs on school grounds\u2014and conducting a search to\nensure students abide by that prohibition\u2014the school rule\nhere was consistent with a routine provision of the state\ncriminal code. It hardly seems unreasonable for school\nofficials to enforce a rule that, in effect, proscribes conduct\n\nthat amounts to a crime. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n   5 Arizona\u2019s law is not idiosyncratic; many States have separately\n\ncriminalized the unauthorized possession of prescription drugs. See,\ne.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7577.628(1) (Supp. 2008) (\u201cNo person less than\ntwenty-one years of age shall possess upon the real property comprising\na public or private elementary or secondary school or school bus pre\nscription medication without a valid prescription for such medication\u201d);\nOkla.

At least some of these injuries and\ndeaths are likely due to the fact that \u201c[m]ost controlled\nprescription drug abusers are poly-substance abusers,\u201d id.,\nat 3, a habit that is especially likely to result in deadly\ndrug combinations.

As nonster\noidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they pose a risk of\ndeath from overdose. The Pill Book 821, 827 (H. Silverman,\ned., 13th ed. 2008) (observing that Ibuprofen and Naproxen\nare NSAIDs and \u201c[p]eople have died from NSAID over\ndoses\u201d). Moreover, the side-effects caused by the use of\nNSAIDs can be magnified if they are taken in combination\nwith other drugs. See, e.g., Reactions Weekly, p. 18 (Issue\nno. 1235, Jan. 17, 2009) (\u201cA 17-year-old girl developed\nallergic interstitial nephritis and renal failure while re\nceiving escitalopram and ibuprofen\u201d); id., at 26 (Issue no.\n1232, Dec. 13, 2008) (\u201cA 16-month-old boy developed iron\ndeficiency anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia during treat\nment with naproxen\u201d); id., at 15 (Issue no. 1220, Sept. 20,\n2008) (18-year-old \u201cwas diagnosed with pill-induced oeso\nphageal perforation\u201d after taking ibuprofen \u201cand was\nadmitted to the [intensive care unit]\u201d); id., at 20 (Issue no.\n1170, Sept. 22, 2007) (\u201cA 12-year-old boy developed ana\nphylaxis following ingestion of ibuprofen\u201d).\n  If a student with a previously unknown intolerance to\nIbuprofen or Naproxen were to take either drug and be\ncome ill, the public outrage would likely be directed to\nward the school for failing to take steps to prevent the\nunmonitored use of the drug. In light of the risks in\nvolved, a school\u2019s decision to establish and enforce a school\nprohibition on the possession of any unauthorized drug is\nthus a reasonable judgment.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Schools have a significant interest in protecting all students from\n\nprescription drug abuse; young female students are no exception.

So empowered, schoolteachers and administrators\nhad almost complete discretion to establish and enforce\nthe rules they believed were necessary to maintain control\nover their classrooms. See 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on\nAmerican Law 205 (1873) (\u201cSo the power allowed by law to\nthe parent over the person of the child may be delegated to\na tutor or instructor, the better to accomplish the purpose\nof education\u201d); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 441 (1765) (\u201cHe may also delegate part of\nhis parental authority, during his life, to the tutor or\nschoolmaster of his child; who is then in loco parentis, and\nhas such a portion of the parent committed to his charge,\nviz. that of restraint and correction, as may be necessary\nto answer the purposes for which he is employed\u201d).7 The\nperils of judicial policymaking inherent in applying Fourth\nAmendment protections to public schools counsel in favor\nof a return to the understanding that existed in this Na\ntion\u2019s first public schools, which gave teachers discretion\nto craft the rules needed to carry out the disciplinary\nresponsibilities delegated to them by parents.\n   If the common-law view that parents delegate to teach\ners their authority to discipline and maintain order were\nto be applied in this case, the search of Redding would\nstand. There can be no doubt that a parent would have\nhad the authority to conduct the search at issue in this\ncase.

Geor\ngia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 114 (2006). In light of this\nrelationship, the Court has indicated that a parent can\nauthorize a third-party search of a child by consenting to\nsuch a search, even if the child denies his consent. See\nibid.; see also 4 W.

Even more troubling, it has done so in a\ncase in which the underlying response by school adminis\ntrators was reasonable and justified. I cannot join this\nregrettable decision. I, therefore, respectfully dissent from\nthe Court\u2019s determination that this search violated the\nFourth Amendment.\n</pre>",
