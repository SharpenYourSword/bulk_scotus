Argued April 21, 2009—Decided June 25, 2009\nAfter escorting 13-year-old Savana Redding from her middle school\n  classroom to his office, Assistant Principal Wilson showed her a day\n  planner containing knives and other contraband. She admitted own\n  ing the planner, but said that she had lent it to her friend Marissa\n  and that the contraband was not hers. He then produced four pre\n  scription-strength, and one over-the-counter, pain relief pills, all of\n  which are banned under school rules without advance permission.\n  She denied knowledge of them, but Wilson said that he had a report\n  that she was giving pills to fellow students. She denied it and agreed\n  to let him search her belongings. He and Helen Romero, an adminis\n  trative assistant, searched Savana’s backpack, finding nothing. Wil\n  son then had Romero take Savana to the school nurse’s office to\n  search her clothes for pills. After Romero and the nurse, Peggy\n  Schwallier, had Savana remove her outer clothing, they told her to\n  pull her bra out and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her un\n  derpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.\n  No pills were found. Savana’s mother filed suit against petitioner\n  school district (Safford), Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier, alleging\n  that the strip search violated Savana’s Fourth Amendment rights.\n  Claiming qualified immunity, the individuals (hereinafter petition\n  ers) moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the\n  motion, finding that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and\n  the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed. Following the protocol for evalu\n  ating qualified immunity claims, see Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194,\n  200, the court held that the strip search was unjustified under the\n  Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set\n  out in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325. It then applied the test\n2         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    for qualified immunity. Finding that Savana’s right was clearly es\n    tablished at the time of the search, it reversed the summary judg\n    ment as to Wilson, but affirmed as to Schwallier and Romero because\n    they were not independent decisionmakers.\nHeld:\n    1. The search of Savana’s underwear violated the Fourth Amend\n ment. Pp. 3–11.\n       (a) For school searches, “the public interest is best served by a\n Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of\n probable cause.” T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 341. Under the resulting rea\n sonable suspicion standard, a school search “will be permissible . . .\n when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives\n of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex\n of the student and the nature of the infraction.” Id., at 342. The re\n quired knowledge component of reasonable suspicion for a school ad\n ministrator’s evidence search is that it raise a moderate chance of\n finding evidence of wrongdoing. Pp. 3–5.\n       (b) Wilson had sufficient suspicion to justify searching Savana’s\n backpack and outer clothing. A week earlier, a student, Jordan, had\n told the principal and Wilson that students were bringing drugs and\n weapons to school and that he had gotten sick from some pills. On\n the day of the search, Jordan gave Wilson a pill that he said came\n from Marissa. Learning that the pill was prescription strength, Wil\n son called Marissa out of class and was handed the day planner.\n Once in his office, Wilson, with Romero present, had Marissa turn\n out her pockets and open her wallet, producing, inter alia, an over\n the-counter pill that Marissa claimed was Savana’s. She also denied\n knowing about the day planner’s contents. Wilson did not ask her\n when she received the pills from Savana or where Savana might be\n hiding them. After a search of Marissa’s underwear by Romero and\n Schwallier revealed no additional pills, Wilson called Savana into his\n office. He showed her the day planner and confirmed her relation\n ship with Marissa. He knew that the girls had been identified as\n part of an unusually rowdy group at a school dance, during which al\n cohol and cigarettes were found in the girls’ bathroom. He had other\n reasons to connect them with this contraband, for Jordan had told\n the principal that before the dance, he had attended a party at Sa\n vana’s house where alcohol was served. Thus, Marissa’s statement\n that the pills came from Savana was sufficiently plausible to warrant\n suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution. A student\n who is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills is rea\n sonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in her back\n pack. Looking into Savana’s bag, in her presence and in the relative\n privacy of Wilson’s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthan Romero’s subsequent search of her outer clothing. Pp. 5–8.\n      (c) Because the suspected facts pointing to Savana did not indi\ncate that the drugs presented a danger to students or were concealed\nin her underwear, Wilson did not have sufficient suspicion to warrant\nextending the search to the point of making Savana pull out her un\nderwear. Romero and Schwallier said that they did not see anything\nwhen Savana pulled out her underwear, but a strip search and its\nFourth Amendment consequences are not defined by who was looking\nand how much was seen. Savana’s actions in their presence neces\nsarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both\nsubjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy\nsupport the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, re\nquiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authori\nties for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings. Sa\nvana’s subjective expectation of privacy is inherent in her account of\nit as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating. The reasonable\nness of her expectation is indicated by the common reaction of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability in\ntensifies the exposure’s patent intrusiveness. Its indignity does not\noutlaw the search, but it does implicate the rule that “the search [be]\n‘reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place.’ ” T. L. O., supra, at 341. Here, the\ncontent of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion. Be\ncause Wilson knew that the pills were common pain relievers, he\nmust have known of their nature and limited threat and had no rea\nson to suspect that large amounts were being passed around or that\nindividual students had great quantities. Nor could he have sus\npected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear.\nWhen suspected facts must support the categorically extreme intru\nsiveness of a search down to an adolescent’s body, petitioners’ general\nbelief that students hide contraband in their clothing falls short; a\nreasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will suc\nceed. Nondangerous school contraband does not conjure up the spec\nter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence of such be\nhavior at the school; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested that\nSavana was doing that, and the search of Marissa yielded nothing.\nWilson also never determined when Marissa had received the pills\nfrom Savana; had it been a few days before, that would weigh heavily\nagainst any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the\npills on her person, much less in her underwear. Pp. 8–11.\n   2. Although the strip search violated Savana’s Fourth Amendment\nrights, petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are protected from\nliability by qualified immunity because “clearly established law [did]\nnot show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment,” Pearson\n4         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___. The intrusiveness of the strip search\n    here cannot, under T. L. O., be seen as justifiably related to the cir\n    cumstances, but lower court cases viewing school strip searches dif\n    ferently are numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dis\n    senting opinions, to counsel doubt about the clarity with which the\n    right was previously stated.

APRIL REDDING\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 25, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The issue here is whether a 13-year-old student’s Fourth\nAmendment right was violated when she was subjected to\na search of her bra and underpants by school officials\nacting on reasonable suspicion that she had brought for\nbidden prescription and over-the-counter drugs to school.\nBecause there were no reasons to suspect the drugs pre\nsented a danger or were concealed in her underwear, we\nhold that the search did violate the Constitution, but\nbecause there is reason to question the clarity with which\nthe right was established, the official who ordered the\nunconstitutional search is entitled to qualified immunity\nfrom liability.\n                             I\n  The events immediately prior to the search in question\nbegan in 13-year-old Savana Redding’s math class at\nSafford Middle School one October day in 2003. The assis\ntant principal of the school, Kerry Wilson, came into the\nroom and asked Savana to go to his office. There, he\nshowed her a day planner, unzipped and open flat on his\ndesk, in which there were several knives, lighters, a per\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanent marker, and a cigarette. Wilson asked Savana\nwhether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that a\nfew days before she had lent it to her friend, Marissa\nGlines. Savana stated that none of the items in the plan\nner belonged to her.\n  Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription\nstrength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter\nblue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflam\nmation but banned under school rules without advance\npermission. He asked Savana if she knew anything about\nthe pills. Savana answered that she did not. Wilson then\ntold Savana that he had received a report that she was\ngiving these pills to fellow students; Savana denied it and\nagreed to let Wilson search her belongings. Helen Ro\nmero, an administrative assistant, came into the office,\nand together with Wilson they searched Savana’s back\npack, finding nothing.\n  At that point, Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana\nto the school nurse’s office to search her clothes for pills.\nRomero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, asked Savana to\nremove her jacket, socks, and shoes, leaving her in stretch\npants and a T-shirt (both without pockets), which she was\nthen asked to remove. Finally, Savana was told to pull\nher bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out\nthe elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts\nand pelvic area to some degree. No pills were found.\n  Savana’s mother filed suit against Safford Unified\nSchool District #1, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for\nconducting a strip search in violation of Savana’s Fourth\nAmendment rights. The individuals (hereinafter petition\ners) moved for summary judgment, raising a defense of\nqualified immunity. The District Court for the District of\nArizona granted the motion on the ground that there was\nno Fourth Amendment violation, and a panel of the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. 504 F. 3d 828 (2007).\n  A closely divided Circuit sitting en banc, however, re\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nversed. Following the two-step protocol for evaluating\nclaims of qualified immunity, see Saucier v. Katz, 533\nU. S. 194, 200 (2001), the Ninth Circuit held that the strip\nsearch was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test\nfor searches of children by school officials set out in New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985). 531 F. 3d 1071,\n1081–1087 (2008). The Circuit then applied the test for\nqualified immunity, and found that Savana’s right was\nclearly established at the time of the search: “ ‘[t]hese\nnotions of personal privacy are “clearly established” in\nthat they inhere in all of us, particularly middle school\nteenagers, and are inherent in the privacy component of\nthe Fourth Amendment’s proscription against unreason\nable searches.’ ” Id., at 1088–1089 (quoting Brannum v.\nOverton Cty. School Bd., 516 F. 3d 489, 499 (CA6 2008)).\nThe upshot was reversal of summary judgment as to\nWilson, while affirming the judgments in favor of Schwal\nlier, the school nurse, and Romero, the administrative\nassistant, since they had not acted as independent deci\nsionmakers. 531 F. 3d, at 1089.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), and now\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment “right of the people to be secure\nin their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and\nseizures” generally requires a law enforcement officer to\nhave probable cause for conducting a search. “Probable\ncause exists where ‘the facts and circumstances within [an\nofficer’s] knowledge and of which [he] had reasonably\ntrustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that’ an\noffense has been or is being committed,” Brinegar v.\nUnited States, 338 U. S. 160, 175–176 (1949) (quoting\nCarroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)), and\nthat evidence bearing on that offense will be found in the\n4      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nplace to be searched.\n  In T. L. O., we recognized that the school setting “re\nquires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit\nactivity needed to justify a search,” 469 U. S., at 340, and\nheld that for searches by school officials “a careful balanc\ning of governmental and private interests suggests that\nthe public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment\nstandard of reasonableness that stops short of probable\ncause,” id., at 341. We have thus applied a standard of\nreasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school\nadministrator’s search of a student, id., at 342, 345, and\nhave held that a school search “will be permissible in its\nscope when the measures adopted are reasonably related\nto the objectives of the search and not excessively intru\nsive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction,” id., at 342.\n  A number of our cases on probable cause have an im\nplicit bearing on the reliable knowledge element of rea\nsonable suspicion, as we have attempted to flesh out the\nknowledge component by looking to the degree to which\nknown facts imply prohibited conduct, see, e.g., Adams v.\nWilliams, 407 U. S. 143, 148 (1972); id., at 160, n. 9 (Mar\nshall, J., dissenting), the specificity of the information\nreceived, see, e.g., Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410,\n416–417 (1969), and the reliability of its source, see, e.g.,\nAguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, 114 (1964). At the end of\nthe day, however, we have realized that these factors\ncannot rigidly control, Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 230\n(1983), and we have come back to saying that the stan\ndards are “fluid concepts that take their substantive con\ntent from the particular contexts” in which they are being\nassessed. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696\n(1996).\n  Perhaps the best that can be said generally about the\nrequired knowledge component of probable cause for a law\nenforcement officer’s evidence search is that it raise a “fair\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprobability,” Gates, 462 U. S., at 238, or a “substantial\nchance,” id., at 244, n. 13, of discovering evidence of crimi\nnal activity. The lesser standard for school searches could\nas readily be described as a moderate chance of finding\nevidence of wrongdoing.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  In this case, the school’s policies strictly prohibit the\nnonmedical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school\ngrounds, including “ ‘[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter\ndrug, except those for which permission to use in school\nhas been granted pursuant to Board policy.’ ” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 128a.1 A week before Savana was searched,\nanother student, Jordan Romero (no relation of the\nschool’s administrative assistant), told the principal and\nAssistant Principal Wilson that “certain students were\nbringing drugs and weapons on campus,” and that he had\nbeen sick after taking some pills that “he got from a\nclassmate.” App. 8a. On the morning of October 8, the\nsame boy handed Wilson a white pill that he said Marissa\nGlines had given him. He told Wilson that students were\n——————\n   1 When the object of a school search is the enforcement of a school\n\nrule, a valid search assumes, of course, the rule’s legitimacy. But the\nlegitimacy of the rule usually goes without saying as it does here. The\nCourt said plainly in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 342, n. 9\n(1985), that standards of conduct for schools are for school administra\ntors to determine without second-guessing by courts lacking the experi\nence to appreciate what may be needed. Except in patently arbitrary\ninstances, Fourth Amendment analysis takes the rule as a given, as it\nobviously should do in this case. There is no need here either to explain\nthe imperative of keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons\nfor the school’s rule banning all drugs, no matter how benign, without\nadvance permission. Teachers are not pharmacologists trained to\nidentify pills and powders, and an effective drug ban has to be enforce\nable fast. The plenary ban makes sense, and there is no basis to claim\nthat the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming\nof the rule it was aimed at enforcing.\n6       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nplanning to take the pills at lunch.\n  Wilson learned from Peggy Schwallier, the school nurse,\nthat the pill was Ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by\nprescription. Wilson then called Marissa out of class.\nOutside the classroom, Marissa’s teacher handed Wilson\nthe day planner, found within Marissa’s reach, containing\nvarious contraband items. Wilson escorted Marissa back\nto his office.\n  In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested\nMarissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet.\nMarissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a\nrazor blade. Wilson asked where the blue pill came from,\nand Marissa answered, “ ‘I guess it slipped in when she\ngave me the IBU 400s.’ ” Id., at 13a. When Wilson asked\nwhom she meant, Marissa replied, “ ‘Savana Redding.’ ”\nIbid. Wilson then enquired about the day planner and its\ncontents; Marissa denied knowing anything about them.\nWilson did not ask Marissa any followup questions to\ndetermine whether there was any likelihood that Savana\npresently had pills: neither asking when Marissa received\nthe pills from Savana nor where Savana might be hiding\nthem.\n  Schwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill,\nbut information provided through a poison control hotline2\nindicated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an anti\ninflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available\nover the counter. At Wilson’s direction, Marissa was then\nsubjected to a search of her bra and underpants by Ro\nmero and Schwallier, as Savana was later on. The search\nrevealed no additional pills.\n——————\n   2 Poison control centers across the country maintain 24-hour help\n\nhotlines to provide “immediate access to poison exposure management\ninstructions and information on potential poisons.” American Associa\ntion of Poison Control Centers, online at http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/\nAbout/tabid/74/Default.aspx (all Internet materials as visited June 19,\n2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   It was at this juncture that Wilson called Savana into\nhis office and showed her the day planner. Their conver\nsation established that Savana and Marissa were on\nfriendly terms: while she denied knowledge of the contra\nband, Savana admitted that the day planner was hers and\nthat she had lent it to Marissa. Wilson had other reports\nof their friendship from staff members, who had identified\nSavana and Marissa as part of an unusually rowdy group\nat the school’s opening dance in August, during which\nalcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls’ bathroom.\nWilson had reason to connect the girls with this contra\nband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero had told the\nprincipal that before the dance, he had been at a party at\nSavana’s house where alcohol was served. Marissa’s\nstatement that the pills came from Savana was thus suffi\nciently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was\ninvolved in pill distribution.\n   This suspicion of Wilson’s was enough to justify a search\nof Savana’s backpack and outer clothing.3 If a student is\nreasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is\nreasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and\nin the carryall that has become an item of student uniform\nin most places today. If Wilson’s reasonable suspicion of\npill distribution were not understood to support searches\nof outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any\nsearch worth making. And the look into Savana’s bag, in\nher presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson’s office,\nwas not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero’s\nsubsequent search of her outer clothing.\n——————\n  3 There is no question here that justification for the school officials’\n\nsearch was required in accordance with the T. L. O. standard of reason\nable suspicion, for it is common ground that Savana had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy covering the personal things she chose to carry in\nher backpack, cf. 469 U.

REDDING\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana’s\nclaim that extending the search at Wilson’s behest to the\npoint of making her pull out her underwear was constitu\ntionally unreasonable. The exact label for this final step\nin the intrusion is not important, though strip search is a\nfair way to speak of it. Romero and Schwallier directed\nSavana to remove her clothes down to her underwear, and\nthen “pull out” her bra and the elastic band on her under\npants. Id., at 23a. Although Romero and Schwallier\nstated that they did not see anything when Savana fol\nlowed their instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, we\nwould not define strip search and its Fourth Amendment\nconsequences in a way that would guarantee litigation\nabout who was looking and how much was seen. The very\nfact of Savana’s pulling her underwear away from her\nbody in the presence of the two officials who were able to\nsee her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to\nsome degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal\nexpectations of personal privacy support the treatment of\nsuch a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct\nelements of justification on the part of school authorities\nfor going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.\n   Savana’s subjective expectation of privacy against such\na search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing,\nfrightening, and humiliating. The reasonableness of her\nexpectation (required by the Fourth Amendment stan\ndard) is indicated by the consistent experiences of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulner\nability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure.\nSee Brief for National Association of Social Workers et al.\nas Amici Curiae 6–14; Hyman & Perone, The Other Side of\nSchool Violence: Educator Policies and Practices that may\nContribute to Student Misbehavior, 36 J.

No.\nA–432, p. 2 (2005), online at http://docs.nycenet.edu/\ndocushare/dsweb/Get/Document-21/A-432.pdf (“Under no\ncircumstances shall a strip-search of a student be\nconducted”).\n   The indignity of the search does not, of course, outlaw it,\nbut it does implicate the rule of reasonableness as stated\nin T. L. O., that “the search as actually conducted [be]\nreasonably related in scope to the circumstances which\njustified the interference in the first place.” 469 U. S., at\n341 (internal quotation marks omitted). The scope will be\npermissible, that is, when it is “not excessively intrusive in\nlight of the age and sex of the student and the nature of\nthe infraction.” Id., at 342.\n   Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the\ndegree of intrusion. Wilson knew beforehand that the pills\nwere prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter\nnaproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil,\nor one Aleve.4 He must have been aware of the nature and\nlimited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for,\nand while just about anything can be taken in quantities\nthat will do real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect\n\n——————\n  4 AnAdvil tablet, caplet, or gel caplet, contains 200 mg of ibuprofen.\nSee Physicians’ Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, Dietary\nSupplements, and Herbs 674 (28th ed. 2006). An Aleve caplet contains\n200 mg naproxen and 20 mg sodium. See id., at 675.\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat large amounts of the drugs were being passed around,\nor that individual students were receiving great numbers\nof pills.\n   Nor could Wilson have suspected that Savana was\nhiding common painkillers in her underwear. Petitioners\nsuggest, as a truth universally acknowledged, that “stu\ndents . . . hid[e] contraband in or under their clothing,”\nReply Brief for Petitioners 8, and cite a smattering of\ncases of students with contraband in their underwear, id.,\nat 8–9. But when the categorically extreme intrusiveness\nof a search down to the body of an adolescent requires\nsome justification in suspected facts, general background\npossibilities fall short; a reasonable search that extensive\ncalls for suspicion that it will pay off. But nondangerous\nschool contraband does not raise the specter of stashes in\nintimate places, and there is no evidence in the record of\nany general practice among Safford Middle School stu\ndents of hiding that sort of thing in underwear; neither\nJordan nor Marissa suggested to Wilson that Savana was\ndoing that, and the preceding search of Marissa that\nWilson ordered yielded nothing. Wilson never even de\ntermined when Marissa had received the pills from Sa\nvana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh\nheavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana\npresently had the pills on her person, much less in her\nunderwear.\n   In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that\npointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the\nstudents from the power of the drugs or their quantity,\nand any reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills\nin her underwear. We think that the combination of these\ndeficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.\n   In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the\nassistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his\nmotive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school\nand protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough. Parents are known to overreact to protect their\nchildren from danger, and a school official with responsi\nbility for safety may tend to do the same. The difference is\nthat the Fourth Amendment places limits on the official,\neven with the high degree of deference that courts must\npay to the educator’s professional judgment.\n   We do mean, though, to make it clear that the T. L. O.\nconcern to limit a school search to reasonable scope re\nquires the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of\nresort to underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing\nbefore a search can reasonably make the quantum leap\nfrom outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate\nparts. The meaning of such a search, and the degradation\nits subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intru\nsive in a category of its own demanding its own specific\nsuspicions.\n                               IV\n   A school official searching a student is “entitled to quali\nfied immunity where clearly established law does not show\nthat the search violated the Fourth Amendment.” Pearson\nv. Callahan, 555 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op., at 18). To be\nestablished clearly, however, there is no need that “the\nvery action in question [have] previously been held unlaw\nful.” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999). The\nunconstitutionality of outrageous conduct obviously will be\nunconstitutional, this being the reason, as Judge Posner\nhas said, that “[t]he easiest cases don’t even arise.” K. H.\nv. Morgan, 914 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA7 1990). But even as to\naction less than an outrage, “officials can still be on notice\nthat their conduct violates established law . . . in novel\nfactual circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 741\n(2002).\n   T. L. O. directed school officials to limit the intrusive\nness of a search, “in light of the age and sex of the student\nand the nature of the infraction,” 469 U. S., at 342, and as\n12     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have just said at some length, the intrusiveness of the\nstrip search here cannot be seen as justifiably related to\nthe circumstances. But we realize that the lower courts\nhave reached divergent conclusions regarding how the\nT. L. O. standard applies to such searches.\n  A number of judges have read T. L. O. as the en banc\nminority of the Ninth Circuit did here. The Sixth Circuit\nupheld a strip search of a high school student for a drug,\nwithout any suspicion that drugs were hidden next to her\nbody. Williams v. Ellington, 936 F. 2d 881, 882–883, 887\n(1991). And other courts considering qualified immunity\nfor strip searches have read T. L. O. as “a series of ab\nstractions, on the one hand, and a declaration of seeming\ndeference to the judgments of school officials, on the\nother,” Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Ed., 115 F. 3d 821,\n828 (CA11 1997) (en banc), which made it impossible “to\nestablish clearly the contours of a Fourth Amendment\nright . . . [in] the wide variety of possible school settings\ndifferent from those involved in T. L. O.” itself. Ibid. See\nalso Thomas v. Roberts, 323 F. 3d 950 (CA11 2003) (grant\ning qualified immunity to a teacher and police officer who\nconducted a group strip search of a fifth grade class when\nlooking for a missing $26).\n  We think these differences of opinion from our own are\nsubstantial enough to require immunity for the school\nofficials in this case. We would not suggest that entitle\nment to qualified immunity is the guaranteed product of\ndisuniform views of the law in the other federal, or state,\ncourts, and the fact that a single judge, or even a group of\njudges, disagrees about the contours of a right does not\nautomatically render the law unclear if we have been\nclear. That said, however, the cases viewing school strip\nsearches differently from the way we see them are numer\nous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting\nopinions, to counsel doubt that we were sufficiently clear\nin the prior statement of law. We conclude that qualified\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Our\nconclusions here do not resolve, however, the question of\nthe liability of petitioner Safford Unified School District #1\nunder Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436\nU. S. 658, 694 (1978), a claim the Ninth Circuit did not\naddress. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore\naffirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is\nremanded for consideration of the Monell claim.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985), the\nCourt established a two-step inquiry for determining the\nreasonableness of a school official’s decision to search a\nstudent. First, the Court explained, the search must be\n“ ‘justified at its inception’ ” by the presence of “reasonable\ngrounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evi\ndence that the student has violated or is violating either\nthe law or the rules of the school.” Id., at 342. Second, the\nsearch must be “permissible in its scope,” which is\nachieved “when the measures adopted are reasonably\nrelated to the objectives of the search and not excessively\nintrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n    Nothing the Court decides today alters this basic\nframework. It simply applies T. L. O. to declare unconsti\ntutional a strip search of a 13-year-old honors student that\nwas based on a groundless suspicion that she might be\nhiding medicine in her underwear. This is, in essence, a\ncase in which clearly established law meets clearly outra\ngeous conduct. I have long believed that “ ‘[i]t does not\nrequire a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude\nsearch of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitu\ntional rights of some magnitude.’ ” Id., at 382, n. 25\n2       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(quoting Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F. 2d 91, 92–93 (CA7 1980)).\nThe strip search of Savana Redding in this case was both\nmore intrusive and less justified than the search of the\nstudent’s purse in T. L. O. Therefore, while I join Parts I–\nIII of the Court’s opinion, I disagree with its decision to\nextend qualified immunity to the school official who au\nthorized this unconstitutional search.\n   The Court reaches a contrary conclusion about qualified\nimmunity based on the fact that various Courts of Appeals\nhave adopted seemingly divergent views about T. L. O.’s\napplication to strip searches. Ante, at 12. But the clarity\nof a well-established right should not depend on whether\njurists have misread our precedents. And while our cases\nhave previously noted the “divergence of views” among\ncourts in deciding whether to extend qualified immunity,\ne.g., Pearson v. Callahan, (2009) 555 U. S., ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 20) (noting the unsettled constitutionality of the so\ncalled “consent-once-removed” doctrine); Wilson v. Layne,\n526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999) (considering conflicting views on\nthe constitutionality of law enforcement’s practice of al\nlowing the media to enter a private home to observe and\nfilm attempted arrests), we have relied on that considera\ntion only to spare officials from having “ ‘to predict the\nfuture course of constitutional law,’ ” Id., at 617 (quoting\nProcunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 562 (1978); empha\nsis added). In this case, by contrast, we chart no new\nconstitutional path. We merely decide whether the deci\nsion to strip search Savana Redding, on these facts, was\nprohibited under T. L. O. Our conclusion leaves the\nboundaries of the law undisturbed.*\n——————\n  * In fact, in T. L. O. we cited with approval a Ninth Circuit case, Bil\nbrey v. Brown, 738 F. 2d 1462 (1984), which held that a strip search\nperformed under similar circumstances violated the Constitution. New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.

But I\nalso agree with JUSTICE STEVENS, ante, at 1–2, that our\nopinion in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985),\n“clearly established” the law governing this case.\n   Fellow student Marissa Glines, caught with pills in her\npocket, accused Redding of supplying them. App. 13a.\nAsked where the blue pill among several white pills in\nGlines’s pocket came from, Glines answered: “I guess it\nslipped in when she gave me the IBU 400s.” Ibid. Asked\nnext “who is she?”, Glines responded: “Savana Redding.”\nIbid. As the Court observes, ante, at 6, 10, no followup\nquestions were asked. Wilson did not test Glines’s accusa\ntion for veracity by asking Glines when did Redding give\nher the pills, where, for what purpose. Any reasonable\nsearch for the pills would have ended when inspection of\nRedding’s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing.\nWilson had no cause to suspect, based on prior experience\nat the school or clues in this case, that Redding had hid\nden pills—containing the equivalent of two Advils or one\nAleve—in her underwear or body. To make matters\nworse, Wilson did not release Redding, to return to class\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nor to go home, after the search. Instead, he made her sit\non a chair outside his office for over two hours. At no\npoint did he attempt to call her parent. Abuse of authority\nof that order should not be shielded by official immunity.\n   In contrast to T. L. O., where a teacher discovered a\nstudent smoking in the lavatory, and where the search\nwas confined to the student’s purse, the search of Redding\ninvolved her body and rested on the bare accusation of\nanother student whose reliability the Assistant Principal\nhad no reason to trust. The Court’s opinion in T. L. O.\nplainly stated the controlling Fourth Amendment law: A\nsearch ordered by a school official, even if “justified at its\ninception,” crosses the constitutional boundary if it be\ncomes “excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of\nthe student and the nature of the infraction.” 469 U. S., at\n342 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Here, “the nature of the [supposed] infraction,” the slim\nbasis for suspecting Savana Redding, and her “age and\nsex,” ibid., establish beyond doubt that Assistant Principal\nWilson’s order cannot be reconciled with this Court’s\nopinion in T. L. O. Wilson’s treatment of Redding was\nabusive and it was not reasonable for him to believe that\nthe law permitted it.

See ante, at 11–13. Unlike the majority,\nhowever, I would hold that the search of Savana Redding\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment. The majority\nimposes a vague and amorphous standard on school ad\nministrators. It also grants judges sweeping authority to\nsecond-guess the measures that these officials take to\nmaintain discipline in their schools and ensure the health\nand safety of the students in their charge. This deep\nintrusion into the administration of public schools exem\nplifies why the Court should return to the common-law\ndoctrine of in loco parentis under which “the judiciary was\nreluctant to interfere in the routine business of school\nadministration, allowing schools and teachers to set and\nenforce rules and to maintain order.” Morse v. Frederick,\n551 U. S. 393, 414 (2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring). But\neven under the prevailing Fourth Amendment test estab\nlished by New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985), all\npetitioners, including the school district, are entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law in their favor.\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

Thus, although\npublic school students retain Fourth Amendment rights\nunder this Court’s precedent, see id., at 333–337, those\nrights “are different . . . than elsewhere; the ‘reasonable\nness’ inquiry cannot disregard the schools’ custodial and\ntutelary responsibility for children,” Vernonia School Dist.\n47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 656 (1995); see also T. L. O.,\n469 U. S., at 339 (identifying “the substantial interest of\nteachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in\nthe classroom and on school grounds”). For nearly 25\nyears this Court has understood that “[m]aintaining order\nin the classroom has never been easy, but in more recent\nyears, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly\nforms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have\nbecome major social problems.” Ibid. In schools, “[e]vents\ncalling for discipline are frequent occurrences and some\ntimes require immediate, effective action.” Goss v. Lopez,\n419 U. S. 565, 580 (1975); see also T. L. O., 469 U. S., at\n340 (explaining that schools have a “legitimate need to\nmaintain an environment in which learning can take\nplace”).\n  For this reason, school officials retain broad authority\nto protect students and preserve “order and a proper\neducational environment” under the Fourth Amendment.\nId., at 339. This authority requires that school officials be\nable to engage in the “close supervision of schoolchildren,\nas well as . . . enforc[e] rules against conduct that would\nbe perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.” Ibid.\nSeeking to reconcile the Fourth Amendment with this\nunique public school setting, the Court in T. L. O. held\nthat a school search is “reasonable” if it is “ ‘justified at its\ninception’ ” and “ ‘reasonably related in scope to the cir\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

S.\n1, 20 (1968)). The search under review easily meets this\nstandard.\n                                A\n  A “search of a student by a teacher or other school offi\ncial will be ‘justified at its inception’ when there are rea\nsonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn\nup evidence that the student has violated or is violating\neither the law or the rules of the school.” T. L. O., supra,\nat 341–342 (footnote omitted). As the majority rightly\nconcedes, this search was justified at its inception because\nthere were reasonable grounds to suspect that Redding\npossessed medication that violated school rules. See ante,\nat 7. A finding of reasonable suspicion “does not deal with\nhard certainties, but with probabilities.” United States v.\nCortez, 449 U. S. 411, 418 (1981); see also T. L. O., supra,\nat 346 (“[T]he requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a\nrequirement of absolute certainty”). To satisfy this stan\ndard, more than a mere “hunch” of wrongdoing is required,\nbut “considerably” less suspicion is needed than would be\nrequired to “satisf[y] a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard.” United States v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 274\n(2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  Furthermore, in evaluating whether there is a reason\nable “particularized and objective” basis for conducting a\nsearch based on suspected wrongdoing, government offi\ncials must consider the “totality of the circumstances.” Id.,\nat 273 (internal quotation marks omitted). School officials\nhave a specialized understanding of the school environ\nment, the habits of the students, and the concerns of the\ncommunity, which enables them to “ ‘formulat[e] certain\ncommon-sense conclusions about human behavior.’ ”\nUnited States v.

As an initial matter, school officials\nwere aware that a few years earlier, a student had become\n“seriously ill” and “spent several days in intensive care”\nafter ingesting prescription medication obtained from a\nclassmate. App. 10a. Fourth Amendment searches do not\noccur in a vacuum; rather, context must inform the judi\ncial inquiry. See Cortez, supra, at 417–418. In this in\nstance, the suspicion of drug possession arose at a middle\nschool that had “a history of problems with students using\nand distributing prohibited and illegal substances on\ncampus.” App. 7a, 10a.\n   The school’s substance-abuse problems had not abated\nby the 2003–2004 school year, which is when the chal\nlenged search of Redding took place. School officials had\nfound alcohol and cigarettes in the girls’ bathroom during\nthe first school dance of the year and noticed that a group\nof students including Redding and Marissa Glines smelled\nof alcohol. Ibid. Several weeks later, another student,\nJordan Romero, reported that Redding had hosted a party\nbefore the dance where she served whiskey, vodka, and\ntequila. Id., at 8a, 11a. Romero had provided this report\nto school officials as a result of a meeting his mother\nscheduled with the officials after Romero “bec[a]me vio\n                    Cite as: 557 U.

At that meeting,\nRomero admitted that “certain students were bringing\ndrugs and weapons on campus.” Id., at 8a, 11a. One week\nlater, Romero handed the assistant principal a white pill\nthat he said he had received from Glines. Id., at 11a. He\nreported “that a group of students [were] planning on\ntaking the pills at lunch.” Ibid.\n   School officials justifiably took quick action in light of\nthe lunchtime deadline. The assistant principal took the\npill to the school nurse who identified it as prescription\nstrength 400-mg Ibuprofen. Id., at 12a. A subsequent\nsearch of Glines and her belongings produced a razor\nblade, a Naproxen 200-mg pill, and several Ibuprofen 400\nmg pills. Id., at 13a. When asked, Glines claimed that\nshe had received the pills from Redding. Ibid. A search of\nRedding’s planner, which Glines had borrowed, then un\ncovered “several knives, several lighters, a cigarette, and a\npermanent marker.” Id., at 12a, 14a, 22a. Thus, as the\nmajority acknowledges, ante, at 7, the totality of relevant\ncircumstances justified a search of Redding for pills.1\n                            B\n  The remaining question is whether the search was\nreasonable in scope. Under T. L. O., “a search will be\npermissible in its scope when the measures adopted are\nreasonably related to the objectives of the search and not\nexcessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the\n\n——————\n  1 To be sure, Redding denied knowledge of the pills and the materials\n\nin her planner. App. 14a. But her denial alone does not negate the\nreasonable suspicion held by school officials. See New Jersey v.\nT. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 345 (1985) (finding search reasonable even\nthough “T. L. O. had been accused of smoking, and had denied the\naccusation in the strongest possible terms when she stated that she did\nnot smoke at all”).\n6        SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nstudent and the nature of the infraction.” 469 U. S., at\n342. The majority concludes that the school officials’\nsearch of Redding’s underwear was not “ ‘reasonably re\nlated in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place,’ ” see ante, at 8–11, notwith\nstanding the officials’ reasonable suspicion that Redding\n“was involved in pill distribution,” ante, at 7. According to\nthe majority, to be reasonable, this school search required\na showing of “danger to the students from the power of the\ndrugs or their quantity” or a “reason to suppose that [Red\nding] was carrying pills in her underwear.” Ante, at 10.\nEach of these additional requirements is an unjustifiable\ndeparture from bedrock Fourth Amendment law in the\nschool setting, where this Court has heretofore read the\nFourth Amendment to grant considerable leeway to school\nofficials. Because the school officials searched in a loca\ntion where the pills could have been hidden, the search\nwas reasonable in scope under T. L. O.\n                                     1\n  The majority finds that “subjective and reasonable\nsocietal expectations of personal privacy support . . .\ntreat[ing]” this type of search, which it labels a “strip\nsearch,” as “categorically distinct, requiring distinct ele\nments of justification on the part of school authorities for\ngoing beyond a search of clothing and belongings.” Ante,\nat 8.2 Thus, in the majority’s view, although the school\nofficials had reasonable suspicion to believe that Redding\n——————\n   2 Like the dissent below, “I would reserve the term ‘strip search’ for a\n\nsearch that required its subject to fully disrobe in view of officials.” 531\nF. 3d 1071, 1091, n. 1 (CA9 2008) (opinion of Hawkins, J.). The distinc\ntion between a strip search and the search at issue in this case may be\nslight, but it is a distinction that the law has drawn. See, e.g., Sandin\nv. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 475 (1995) (“The officer subjected Conner to a\nstrip search, complete with inspection of the rectal area”); Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558, and n. 39 (1979) (describing visual inspec\ntion of body cavities as “part of a strip search”).\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

See, e.g., Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295,\n307 (1999) (Police officers “may inspect passengers’ be\nlongings found in the car that are capable of concealing\nthe object of the search”); Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U. S. 248,\n251 (1991) (“The scope of a search is generally defined by\nits expressed object”); United States v. Johns, 469 U. S.\n478, 487 (1985) (search reasonable because “there is no\nplausible argument that the object of the search could not\nhave been concealed in the packages”); United States v.\nRoss, 456 U. S. 798, 820 (1982) (“A lawful search . . . gen\nerally extends to the entire area in which the object of the\nsearch may be found”).3\n   In keeping with this longstanding rule, the “nature of\nthe infraction” referenced in T. L. O. delineates the proper\nscope of a search of students in a way that is identical to\nthat permitted for searches outside the school—i.e., the\nsearch must be limited to the areas where the object of\nthat infraction could be concealed. See Horton v. Califor\nnia, 496 U. S. 128, 141 (1990) (“Police with a warrant for a\nrifle may search only places where rifles might be” (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)); Ross, supra, at 824\n(“[P]robable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are\nbeing transported in a van will not justify a warrantless\n——————\n  3 The Court has adopted a different standard for searches involving\n\nan “intrusio[n] into the human body.” Schmerber v. California, 384\nU. S. 757, 770 (1966). The search here does not implicate the Court’s\ncases governing bodily intrusions, however, because it did not involve a\n“physical intrusion, penetrating beneath the skin,” Skinner v. Railway\nLabor Executives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 616 (1989).\n8      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nsearch of a suitcase”). A search of a student therefore is\npermissible in scope under T. L. O. so long as it is objec\ntively reasonable to believe that the area searched could\nconceal the contraband. The dissenting opinion below\ncorrectly captured this Fourth Amendment standard,\nnoting that “if a student brought a baseball bat on campus\nin violation of school policy, a search of that student’s shirt\npocket would be patently unjustified.” 531 F. 3d, at 1104\n(opinion of Hawkins, J.).\n   The analysis of whether the scope of the search here was\npermissible under that standard is straightforward.\nIndeed, the majority does not dispute that “general back\nground possibilities” establish that students conceal “con\ntraband in their underwear.” Ante, at 10. It acknowledges\nthat school officials had reasonable suspicion to look in\nRedding’s backpack and outer clothing because if “Wilson’s\nreasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not under\nstood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it\nwould not justify any search worth making.” Ante, at 7.\nThe majority nevertheless concludes that proceeding any\nfurther with the search was unreasonable. See ante, at 8–\n10; see also ante, at 1 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (“Any reasonable search for the\npills would have ended when inspection of Redding’s\nbackpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing”). But there\nis no support for this conclusion. The reasonable suspicion\nthat Redding possessed the pills for distribution purposes\ndid not dissipate simply because the search of her back\npack turned up nothing. It was eminently reasonable to\nconclude that the backpack was empty because Redding\nwas secreting the pills in a place she thought no one would\nlook. See Ross, supra, at 820 (“Contraband goods rarely\nare strewn” about in plain view; “by their very nature such\ngoods must be withheld from public view”).\n   Redding would not have been the first person to conceal\npills in her undergarments.

Nor will she be the last after today’s\ndecision, which announces the safest place to secrete\ncontraband in school.\n                              2\n  The majority compounds its error by reading the “nature\nof the infraction” aspect of the T. L. O. test as a license to\nlimit searches based on a judge’s assessment of a particu\nlar school policy. According to the majority, the scope of\nthe search was impermissible because the school official\n“must have been aware of the nature and limited threat of\nthe specific drugs he was searching for” and because he\n“had no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs\nwere being passed around, or that individual students\nwere receiving great numbers of pills.” Ante, at 9–10.\nThus, in order to locate a rationale for finding a Fourth\nAmendment violation in this case, the majority retreats\nfrom its observation that the school’s firm no-drug policy\n“makes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the\nsearch was unreasonable owing to some defect or short\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ncoming of the rule it was aimed at enforcing.” Ante, at 5,\nn. 1.\n   Even accepting the majority’s assurances that it is not\nattacking the rule’s reasonableness, it certainly is attack\ning the rule’s importance. This approach directly conflicts\nwith T. L. O. in which the Court was “unwilling to adopt a\nstandard under which the legality of a search is dependent\nupon a judge’s evaluation of the relative importance of\nschool rules.” 469 U. S., at 342, n. 9. Indeed, the Court in\nT. L. O. expressly rejected the proposition that the major\nity seemingly endorses—that “some rules regarding stu\ndent conduct are by nature too ‘trivial’ to justify a search\nbased upon reasonable suspicion.” Ibid.; see also id., at\n343, n. 9 (“The promulgation of a rule forbidding specified\nconduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of\nschool officials that such conduct is destructive of school\norder or of a proper educational environment. Absent any\nsuggestion that the rule violates some substantive consti\ntutional guarantee, the courts should as a general matter,\ndefer to that judgment”).\n   The majority’s decision in this regard also departs from\nanother basic principle of the Fourth Amendment: that\nlaw enforcement officials can enforce with the same vigor\nall rules and regulations irrespective of the perceived\nimportance of any of those rules. “In a long line of cases,\nwe have said that when an officer has probable cause to\nbelieve a person committed even a minor crime in his\npresence, the balancing of private and public interests is\nnot in doubt. The arrest is constitutionally reasonable.”\nVirginia v. Moore, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6).\nThe Fourth Amendment rule for searches is the same:\nPolice officers are entitled to search regardless of the\nperceived triviality of the underlying law. As we have\nexplained, requiring police to make “sensitive, case-by\ncase determinations of government need,” Atwater v. Lago\nVista, 532 U.

Had the suspected infraction involved a\nstreet drug, the majority implies that it would have ap\nproved the scope of the search. See ante, at 9 (relying on\nthe “limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching\nfor”); ante, at 10 (relying on the limited “power of the\ndrugs” involved). In effect, then, the majority has replaced\na school rule that draws no distinction among drugs with a\nnew one that does. As a result, a full search of a student’s\nperson for prohibited drugs will be permitted only if the\nCourt agrees that the drug in question was sufficiently\ndangerous. Such a test is unworkable and unsound.\nSchool officials cannot be expected to halt searches based\non the possibility that a court might later find that the\nparticular infraction at issue is not severe enough to war\nrant an intrusive investigation.4\n——————\n  4 JUSTICE  GINSBURG suggests that requiring Redding to “sit on a chair\noutside [the assistant principal’s] office for over two hours” and failing\nto call her parents before conducting the search constitutes an “[a]buse\nof authority” that “should not be shielded by official immunity.” See\nante, at 1–2. But the school was under no constitutional obligation to\ncall Redding’s parents before conducting the search: “[R]easonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least\nintrusive means, because the logic of such elaborate less-restrictive\nalternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise\nof virtually all search-and-seizure powers.” Board of Ed. of Independ\nent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 837\n(2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). For the same\nreason, the Constitution did not require school officials to ask “followup\nquestions” after they had already developed reasonable suspicion that\nRedding possessed drugs. See ante, at 6, 10 (majority opinion); ante, at\n1 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In any event, the suggestion that requiring\nRedding to sit in a chair for two hours amounted to a deprivation of her\nconstitutional rights, or that school officials are required to engage in\n12      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                        Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   A rule promulgated by a school board represents the\njudgment of school officials that the rule is needed to\nmaintain “school order” and “a proper educational envi\nronment.” T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 343, n. 9. Teachers,\nadministrators, and the local school board are called upon\nboth to “protect the . . . safety of students and school per\nsonnel” and “maintain an environment conducive to learn\ning.” Id., at 353 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).\nThey are tasked with “watch[ing] over a large number of\nstudents” who “are inclined to test the outer boundaries of\nacceptable conduct and to imitate the misbehavior of a\npeer if that misbehavior is not dealt with quickly.” Id., at\n352. In such an environment, something as simple as a\n“water pistol or peashooter can wreak [havoc] until it is\ntaken away.” Ibid. The danger posed by unchecked dis\ntribution and consumption of prescription pills by students\ncertainly needs no elaboration.\n   Judges are not qualified to second-guess the best man\nner for maintaining quiet and order in the school envi\nronment. Such institutional judgments, like those con\ncerning the selection of the best methods for “restrain[ing\nstudents] from assaulting one another, abusing drugs and\nalcohol, and committing other crimes,” id., at 342, n. 9,\n“involve a host of policy choices that must be made by\nlocally elected representatives, rather than by federal\njudges interpreting the basic charter of Government for\nthe entire country.” Collins v.

It is a crime\nto possess or use prescription-strength Ibuprofen without\na prescription. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–3406(A)(1)\n(West Supp. 2008) (“A person shall not knowingly . . .\n[p]ossess or use a prescription-only drug unless the person\nobtains the prescription-only drug pursuant to a valid\nprescription of a prescriber who is licensed pursuant to\n[state law]”).5 By prohibiting unauthorized prescription\ndrugs on school grounds—and conducting a search to\nensure students abide by that prohibition—the school rule\nhere was consistent with a routine provision of the state\ncriminal code. It hardly seems unreasonable for school\nofficials to enforce a rule that, in effect, proscribes conduct\n\nthat amounts to a crime. \n\n—————— \n\n   5 Arizona’s law is not idiosyncratic; many States have separately\n\ncriminalized the unauthorized possession of prescription drugs. See,\ne.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. §577.628(1) (Supp. 2008) (“No person less than\ntwenty-one years of age shall possess upon the real property comprising\na public or private elementary or secondary school or school bus pre\nscription medication without a valid prescription for such medication”);\nOkla.

REDDING\n\n                        Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nDanger 3 (“Pain relievers like Vicodin and OxyContin are\nthe prescription drugs most commonly abused by teens”).\nBut they are not without their own dangers. As nonster\noidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they pose a risk of\ndeath from overdose. The Pill Book 821, 827 (H. Silverman,\ned., 13th ed. 2008) (observing that Ibuprofen and Naproxen\nare NSAIDs and “[p]eople have died from NSAID over\ndoses”). Moreover, the side-effects caused by the use of\nNSAIDs can be magnified if they are taken in combination\nwith other drugs. See, e.g., Reactions Weekly, p. 18 (Issue\nno. 1235, Jan. 17, 2009) (“A 17-year-old girl developed\nallergic interstitial nephritis and renal failure while re\nceiving escitalopram and ibuprofen”); id., at 26 (Issue no.\n1232, Dec. 13, 2008) (“A 16-month-old boy developed iron\ndeficiency anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia during treat\nment with naproxen”); id., at 15 (Issue no. 1220, Sept. 20,\n2008) (18-year-old “was diagnosed with pill-induced oeso\nphageal perforation” after taking ibuprofen “and was\nadmitted to the [intensive care unit]”); id., at 20 (Issue no.\n1170, Sept. 22, 2007) (“A 12-year-old boy developed ana\nphylaxis following ingestion of ibuprofen”).\n  If a student with a previously unknown intolerance to\nIbuprofen or Naproxen were to take either drug and be\ncome ill, the public outrage would likely be directed to\nward the school for failing to take steps to prevent the\nunmonitored use of the drug. In light of the risks in\nvolved, a school’s decision to establish and enforce a school\nprohibition on the possession of any unauthorized drug is\nthus a reasonable judgment.6\n——————\n  6 Schools have a significant interest in protecting all students from\n\nprescription drug abuse; young female students are no exception. See\nTeens and Prescription Drugs 2 (“Prescription drugs are the most\ncommonly abused drug among 12–13-year-olds”). In fact, among 12- to\n17-year-olds, females are “more likely than boys to have abused pre\nscription drugs” and have “higher rates of dependence or abuse involv\ning prescription drugs.” Id., at 5.

Safford prohibited\nits possession on school property. Reasonable suspicion\nthat Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of\nthese policies, therefore, justified a search extending to\nany area where small pills could be concealed. The search\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n                              II\n   By declaring the search unreasonable in this case, the\nmajority has “ ‘surrender[ed] control of the American\npublic school system to public school students’ ” by invali\ndating school policies that treat all drugs equally and by\nsecond-guessing swift disciplinary decisions made by\nschool officials. See Morse, 551 U. S., at 421 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (quoting Tinker v. Des Moines Independent\nCommunity School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 526 (1969) (Black,\nJ., dissenting)). The Court’s interference in these matters\nof great concern to teachers, parents, and students illus\ntrates why the most constitutionally sound approach to\nthe question of applying the Fourth Amendment in local\npublic schools would in fact be the complete restoration of\nthe common-law doctrine of in loco parentis.\n   “[I]n the early years of public schooling,” courts applied\nthe doctrine of in loco parentis to transfer to teachers the\nauthority of a parent to “ ‘command obedience, to control\nstubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad\nhabits.’ ” Morse, supra, at 413–414 (THOMAS, J., concur\n\n—————— \n\nrelevant governmental interest here, Redding’s age and sex, if any\n\nthing, increased the need for a search to prevent the reasonably sus\n\npected use of prescription drugs. \n\n18        SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nring) (quoting State v. Pendergrass, 19 N. C. 365, 365–366\n(1837)). So empowered, schoolteachers and administrators\nhad almost complete discretion to establish and enforce\nthe rules they believed were necessary to maintain control\nover their classrooms. See 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on\nAmerican Law 205 (1873) (“So the power allowed by law to\nthe parent over the person of the child may be delegated to\na tutor or instructor, the better to accomplish the purpose\nof education”); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 441 (1765) (“He may also delegate part of\nhis parental authority, during his life, to the tutor or\nschoolmaster of his child; who is then in loco parentis, and\nhas such a portion of the parent committed to his charge,\nviz. that of restraint and correction, as may be necessary\nto answer the purposes for which he is employed”).7 The\nperils of judicial policymaking inherent in applying Fourth\nAmendment protections to public schools counsel in favor\nof a return to the understanding that existed in this Na\ntion’s first public schools, which gave teachers discretion\nto craft the rules needed to carry out the disciplinary\nresponsibilities delegated to them by parents.\n   If the common-law view that parents delegate to teach\ners their authority to discipline and maintain order were\nto be applied in this case, the search of Redding would\nstand. There can be no doubt that a parent would have\nhad the authority to conduct the search at issue in this\ncase. Parents have “immunity from the strictures of the\nFourth Amendment” when it comes to searches of a child\n——————\n  7 The one aspect of school discipline with respect to which the judici\nary at times became involved was the “imposition of excessive physical\npunishment.” Morse, 551 U. S., at 416 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Some\nearly courts found corporal punishment proper “as long as the teacher\ndid not act with legal malice or cause permanent injury;” while other\ncourts intervened only if the punishment was “clearly excessive.” Ibid.\n(emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted) (collecting\ndecisions).\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

S. 868, 876 (1987) (“[P]arental custodial authority”\ndoes not require “judicial approval for [a] search of a minor\nchild’s room”).\n    As acknowledged by this Court, this principle is based\non the “societal understanding of superior and inferior”\nwith respect to the “parent and child” relationship. Geor\ngia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 114 (2006). In light of this\nrelationship, the Court has indicated that a parent can\nauthorize a third-party search of a child by consenting to\nsuch a search, even if the child denies his consent. See\nibid.; see also 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §8.3(d), p.\n160 (4th ed. 2004) (“[A] father, as the head of the house\nhold with the responsibility and the authority for the\ndiscipline, training and control of his children, has a supe\nrior interest in the family residence to that of his minor\nson, so that the father’s consent to search would be effec\ntive notwithstanding the son’s contemporaneous on-the\nscene objection” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nCertainly, a search by the parent himself is no different,\nregardless of whether or not a child would prefer to be left\nalone. See id., §8.4(b), at 202 (“[E]ven [if] a minor child\n. . . may think of a room as ‘his,’ the overall dominance will\nbe in his parents” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n    Restoring the common-law doctrine of in loco parentis\nwould not, however, leave public schools entirely free to\nimpose any rule they choose. “If parents do not like the\nrules imposed by those schools, they can seek redress in\nschool boards or legislatures; they can send their children\nto private schools or home school them; or they can simply\nmove.” See Morse, 551 U. S., at 419 (THOMAS, J., concur\nring).

Argued April 21, 2009—Decided June 25, 2009\nAfter escorting 13-year-old Savana Redding from her middle school\n  classroom to his office, Assistant Principal Wilson showed her a day\n  planner containing knives and other contraband. She admitted own\n  ing the planner, but said that she had lent it to her friend Marissa\n  and that the contraband was not hers. He then produced four pre\n  scription-strength, and one over-the-counter, pain relief pills, all of\n  which are banned under school rules without advance permission.\n  She denied knowledge of them, but Wilson said that he had a report\n  that she was giving pills to fellow students. She denied it and agreed\n  to let him search her belongings. He and Helen Romero, an adminis\n  trative assistant, searched Savana’s backpack, finding nothing. Wil\n  son then had Romero take Savana to the school nurse’s office to\n  search her clothes for pills. After Romero and the nurse, Peggy\n  Schwallier, had Savana remove her outer clothing, they told her to\n  pull her bra out and shake it, and to pull out the elastic on her un\n  derpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.\n  No pills were found. Savana’s mother filed suit against petitioner\n  school district (Safford), Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier, alleging\n  that the strip search violated Savana’s Fourth Amendment rights.\n  Claiming qualified immunity, the individuals (hereinafter petition\n  ers) moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the\n  motion, finding that there was no Fourth Amendment violation, and\n  the en banc Ninth Circuit reversed. Following the protocol for evalu\n  ating qualified immunity claims, see Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194,\n  200, the court held that the strip search was unjustified under the\n  Fourth Amendment test for searches of children by school officials set\n  out in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325. It then applied the test\n2         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    for qualified immunity. Finding that Savana’s right was clearly es\n    tablished at the time of the search, it reversed the summary judg\n    ment as to Wilson, but affirmed as to Schwallier and Romero because\n    they were not independent decisionmakers.\nHeld:\n    1. The search of Savana’s underwear violated the Fourth Amend\n ment. Pp. 3–11.\n       (a) For school searches, “the public interest is best served by a\n Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of\n probable cause.” T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 341. Under the resulting rea\n sonable suspicion standard, a school search “will be permissible . . .\n when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives\n of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex\n of the student and the nature of the infraction.” Id., at 342. The re\n quired knowledge component of reasonable suspicion for a school ad\n ministrator’s evidence search is that it raise a moderate chance of\n finding evidence of wrongdoing. Pp. 3–5.\n       (b) Wilson had sufficient suspicion to justify searching Savana’s\n backpack and outer clothing. A week earlier, a student, Jordan, had\n told the principal and Wilson that students were bringing drugs and\n weapons to school and that he had gotten sick from some pills. On\n the day of the search, Jordan gave Wilson a pill that he said came\n from Marissa. Learning that the pill was prescription strength, Wil\n son called Marissa out of class and was handed the day planner.\n Once in his office, Wilson, with Romero present, had Marissa turn\n out her pockets and open her wallet, producing, inter alia, an over\n the-counter pill that Marissa claimed was Savana’s. She also denied\n knowing about the day planner’s contents. Wilson did not ask her\n when she received the pills from Savana or where Savana might be\n hiding them. After a search of Marissa’s underwear by Romero and\n Schwallier revealed no additional pills, Wilson called Savana into his\n office. He showed her the day planner and confirmed her relation\n ship with Marissa. He knew that the girls had been identified as\n part of an unusually rowdy group at a school dance, during which al\n cohol and cigarettes were found in the girls’ bathroom. He had other\n reasons to connect them with this contraband, for Jordan had told\n the principal that before the dance, he had attended a party at Sa\n vana’s house where alcohol was served. Thus, Marissa’s statement\n that the pills came from Savana was sufficiently plausible to warrant\n suspicion that Savana was involved in pill distribution. A student\n who is reasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills is rea\n sonably suspected of carrying them on her person and in her back\n pack. Looking into Savana’s bag, in her presence and in the relative\n privacy of Wilson’s office, was not excessively intrusive, any more\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthan Romero’s subsequent search of her outer clothing. Pp. 5–8.\n      (c) Because the suspected facts pointing to Savana did not indi\ncate that the drugs presented a danger to students or were concealed\nin her underwear, Wilson did not have sufficient suspicion to warrant\nextending the search to the point of making Savana pull out her un\nderwear. Romero and Schwallier said that they did not see anything\nwhen Savana pulled out her underwear, but a strip search and its\nFourth Amendment consequences are not defined by who was looking\nand how much was seen. Savana’s actions in their presence neces\nsarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both\nsubjective and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy\nsupport the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, re\nquiring distinct elements of justification on the part of school authori\nties for going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings. Sa\nvana’s subjective expectation of privacy is inherent in her account of\nit as embarrassing, frightening, and humiliating. The reasonable\nness of her expectation is indicated by the common reaction of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulnerability in\ntensifies the exposure’s patent intrusiveness. Its indignity does not\noutlaw the search, but it does implicate the rule that “the search [be]\n‘reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place.’ ” T. L. O., supra, at 341. Here, the\ncontent of the suspicion failed to match the degree of intrusion. Be\ncause Wilson knew that the pills were common pain relievers, he\nmust have known of their nature and limited threat and had no rea\nson to suspect that large amounts were being passed around or that\nindividual students had great quantities. Nor could he have sus\npected that Savana was hiding common painkillers in her underwear.\nWhen suspected facts must support the categorically extreme intru\nsiveness of a search down to an adolescent’s body, petitioners’ general\nbelief that students hide contraband in their clothing falls short; a\nreasonable search that extensive calls for suspicion that it will suc\nceed. Nondangerous school contraband does not conjure up the spec\nter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no evidence of such be\nhavior at the school; neither Jordan nor Marissa suggested that\nSavana was doing that, and the search of Marissa yielded nothing.\nWilson also never determined when Marissa had received the pills\nfrom Savana; had it been a few days before, that would weigh heavily\nagainst any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had the\npills on her person, much less in her underwear. Pp. 8–11.\n   2. Although the strip search violated Savana’s Fourth Amendment\nrights, petitioners Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier are protected from\nliability by qualified immunity because “clearly established law [did]\nnot show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment,” Pearson\n4         SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

There, he\nshowed her a day planner, unzipped and open flat on his\ndesk, in which there were several knives, lighters, a per\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanent marker, and a cigarette. Wilson asked Savana\nwhether the planner was hers; she said it was, but that a\nfew days before she had lent it to her friend, Marissa\nGlines. Savana stated that none of the items in the plan\nner belonged to her.\n  Wilson then showed Savana four white prescription\nstrength ibuprofen 400-mg pills, and one over-the-counter\nblue naproxen 200-mg pill, all used for pain and inflam\nmation but banned under school rules without advance\npermission. He asked Savana if she knew anything about\nthe pills. Savana answered that she did not. Wilson then\ntold Savana that he had received a report that she was\ngiving these pills to fellow students; Savana denied it and\nagreed to let Wilson search her belongings. Helen Ro\nmero, an administrative assistant, came into the office,\nand together with Wilson they searched Savana’s back\npack, finding nothing.\n  At that point, Wilson instructed Romero to take Savana\nto the school nurse’s office to search her clothes for pills.\nRomero and the nurse, Peggy Schwallier, asked Savana to\nremove her jacket, socks, and shoes, leaving her in stretch\npants and a T-shirt (both without pockets), which she was\nthen asked to remove. Finally, Savana was told to pull\nher bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out\nthe elastic on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts\nand pelvic area to some degree. No pills were found.\n  Savana’s mother filed suit against Safford Unified\nSchool District #1, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for\nconducting a strip search in violation of Savana’s Fourth\nAmendment rights. The individuals (hereinafter petition\ners) moved for summary judgment, raising a defense of\nqualified immunity. The District Court for the District of\nArizona granted the motion on the ground that there was\nno Fourth Amendment violation, and a panel of the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed. 504 F. 3d 828 (2007).\n  A closely divided Circuit sitting en banc, however, re\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nversed. Following the two-step protocol for evaluating\nclaims of qualified immunity, see Saucier v. Katz, 533\nU. S. 194, 200 (2001), the Ninth Circuit held that the strip\nsearch was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test\nfor searches of children by school officials set out in New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985). 531 F. 3d 1071,\n1081–1087 (2008). The Circuit then applied the test for\nqualified immunity, and found that Savana’s right was\nclearly established at the time of the search: “ ‘[t]hese\nnotions of personal privacy are “clearly established” in\nthat they inhere in all of us, particularly middle school\nteenagers, and are inherent in the privacy component of\nthe Fourth Amendment’s proscription against unreason\nable searches.’ ” Id., at 1088–1089 (quoting Brannum v.\nOverton Cty. School Bd., 516 F. 3d 489, 499 (CA6 2008)).\nThe upshot was reversal of summary judgment as to\nWilson, while affirming the judgments in favor of Schwal\nlier, the school nurse, and Romero, the administrative\nassistant, since they had not acted as independent deci\nsionmakers. 531 F. 3d, at 1089.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), and now\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment “right of the people to be secure\nin their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and\nseizures” generally requires a law enforcement officer to\nhave probable cause for conducting a search. “Probable\ncause exists where ‘the facts and circumstances within [an\nofficer’s] knowledge and of which [he] had reasonably\ntrustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to\nwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that’ an\noffense has been or is being committed,” Brinegar v.\nUnited States, 338 U. S. 160, 175–176 (1949) (quoting\nCarroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)), and\nthat evidence bearing on that offense will be found in the\n4      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nplace to be searched.\n  In T. L. O., we recognized that the school setting “re\nquires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit\nactivity needed to justify a search,” 469 U. S., at 340, and\nheld that for searches by school officials “a careful balanc\ning of governmental and private interests suggests that\nthe public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment\nstandard of reasonableness that stops short of probable\ncause,” id., at 341. We have thus applied a standard of\nreasonable suspicion to determine the legality of a school\nadministrator’s search of a student, id., at 342, 345, and\nhave held that a school search “will be permissible in its\nscope when the measures adopted are reasonably related\nto the objectives of the search and not excessively intru\nsive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction,” id., at 342.\n  A number of our cases on probable cause have an im\nplicit bearing on the reliable knowledge element of rea\nsonable suspicion, as we have attempted to flesh out the\nknowledge component by looking to the degree to which\nknown facts imply prohibited conduct, see, e.g., Adams v.\nWilliams, 407 U. S. 143, 148 (1972); id., at 160, n. 9 (Mar\nshall, J., dissenting), the specificity of the information\nreceived, see, e.g., Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410,\n416–417 (1969), and the reliability of its source, see, e.g.,\nAguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108, 114 (1964). At the end of\nthe day, however, we have realized that these factors\ncannot rigidly control, Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 230\n(1983), and we have come back to saying that the stan\ndards are “fluid concepts that take their substantive con\ntent from the particular contexts” in which they are being\nassessed. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696\n(1996).\n  Perhaps the best that can be said generally about the\nrequired knowledge component of probable cause for a law\nenforcement officer’s evidence search is that it raise a “fair\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprobability,” Gates, 462 U. S., at 238, or a “substantial\nchance,” id., at 244, n. 13, of discovering evidence of crimi\nnal activity. The lesser standard for school searches could\nas readily be described as a moderate chance of finding\nevidence of wrongdoing.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  In this case, the school’s policies strictly prohibit the\nnonmedical use, possession, or sale of any drug on school\ngrounds, including “ ‘[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter\ndrug, except those for which permission to use in school\nhas been granted pursuant to Board policy.’ ” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 128a.1 A week before Savana was searched,\nanother student, Jordan Romero (no relation of the\nschool’s administrative assistant), told the principal and\nAssistant Principal Wilson that “certain students were\nbringing drugs and weapons on campus,” and that he had\nbeen sick after taking some pills that “he got from a\nclassmate.” App. 8a. On the morning of October 8, the\nsame boy handed Wilson a white pill that he said Marissa\nGlines had given him. He told Wilson that students were\n——————\n   1 When the object of a school search is the enforcement of a school\n\nrule, a valid search assumes, of course, the rule’s legitimacy. But the\nlegitimacy of the rule usually goes without saying as it does here. The\nCourt said plainly in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 342, n. 9\n(1985), that standards of conduct for schools are for school administra\ntors to determine without second-guessing by courts lacking the experi\nence to appreciate what may be needed. Except in patently arbitrary\ninstances, Fourth Amendment analysis takes the rule as a given, as it\nobviously should do in this case. There is no need here either to explain\nthe imperative of keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons\nfor the school’s rule banning all drugs, no matter how benign, without\nadvance permission. Teachers are not pharmacologists trained to\nidentify pills and powders, and an effective drug ban has to be enforce\nable fast. The plenary ban makes sense, and there is no basis to claim\nthat the search was unreasonable owing to some defect or shortcoming\nof the rule it was aimed at enforcing.\n6       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nplanning to take the pills at lunch.\n  Wilson learned from Peggy Schwallier, the school nurse,\nthat the pill was Ibuprofen 400 mg, available only by\nprescription. Wilson then called Marissa out of class.\nOutside the classroom, Marissa’s teacher handed Wilson\nthe day planner, found within Marissa’s reach, containing\nvarious contraband items. Wilson escorted Marissa back\nto his office.\n  In the presence of Helen Romero, Wilson requested\nMarissa to turn out her pockets and open her wallet.\nMarissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a\nrazor blade. Wilson asked where the blue pill came from,\nand Marissa answered, “ ‘I guess it slipped in when she\ngave me the IBU 400s.’ ” Id., at 13a. When Wilson asked\nwhom she meant, Marissa replied, “ ‘Savana Redding.’ ”\nIbid. Wilson then enquired about the day planner and its\ncontents; Marissa denied knowing anything about them.\nWilson did not ask Marissa any followup questions to\ndetermine whether there was any likelihood that Savana\npresently had pills: neither asking when Marissa received\nthe pills from Savana nor where Savana might be hiding\nthem.\n  Schwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill,\nbut information provided through a poison control hotline2\nindicated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an anti\ninflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available\nover the counter. At Wilson’s direction, Marissa was then\nsubjected to a search of her bra and underpants by Ro\nmero and Schwallier, as Savana was later on. The search\nrevealed no additional pills.\n——————\n   2 Poison control centers across the country maintain 24-hour help\n\nhotlines to provide “immediate access to poison exposure management\ninstructions and information on potential poisons.” American Associa\ntion of Poison Control Centers, online at http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/\nAbout/tabid/74/Default.aspx (all Internet materials as visited June 19,\n2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   It was at this juncture that Wilson called Savana into\nhis office and showed her the day planner. Their conver\nsation established that Savana and Marissa were on\nfriendly terms: while she denied knowledge of the contra\nband, Savana admitted that the day planner was hers and\nthat she had lent it to Marissa. Wilson had other reports\nof their friendship from staff members, who had identified\nSavana and Marissa as part of an unusually rowdy group\nat the school’s opening dance in August, during which\nalcohol and cigarettes were found in the girls’ bathroom.\nWilson had reason to connect the girls with this contra\nband, for Wilson knew that Jordan Romero had told the\nprincipal that before the dance, he had been at a party at\nSavana’s house where alcohol was served. Marissa’s\nstatement that the pills came from Savana was thus suffi\nciently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was\ninvolved in pill distribution.\n   This suspicion of Wilson’s was enough to justify a search\nof Savana’s backpack and outer clothing.3 If a student is\nreasonably suspected of giving out contraband pills, she is\nreasonably suspected of carrying them on her person and\nin the carryall that has become an item of student uniform\nin most places today. If Wilson’s reasonable suspicion of\npill distribution were not understood to support searches\nof outer clothes and backpack, it would not justify any\nsearch worth making. And the look into Savana’s bag, in\nher presence and in the relative privacy of Wilson’s office,\nwas not excessively intrusive, any more than Romero’s\nsubsequent search of her outer clothing.\n——————\n  3 There is no question here that justification for the school officials’\n\nsearch was required in accordance with the T. L. O. standard of reason\nable suspicion, for it is common ground that Savana had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy covering the personal things she chose to carry in\nher backpack, cf. 469 U. S., at 339, and that Wilson’s decision to look\nthrough it was a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amend\nment.\n8      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   Here it is that the parties part company, with Savana’s\nclaim that extending the search at Wilson’s behest to the\npoint of making her pull out her underwear was constitu\ntionally unreasonable. The exact label for this final step\nin the intrusion is not important, though strip search is a\nfair way to speak of it. Romero and Schwallier directed\nSavana to remove her clothes down to her underwear, and\nthen “pull out” her bra and the elastic band on her under\npants. Id., at 23a. Although Romero and Schwallier\nstated that they did not see anything when Savana fol\nlowed their instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, we\nwould not define strip search and its Fourth Amendment\nconsequences in a way that would guarantee litigation\nabout who was looking and how much was seen. The very\nfact of Savana’s pulling her underwear away from her\nbody in the presence of the two officials who were able to\nsee her necessarily exposed her breasts and pelvic area to\nsome degree, and both subjective and reasonable societal\nexpectations of personal privacy support the treatment of\nsuch a search as categorically distinct, requiring distinct\nelements of justification on the part of school authorities\nfor going beyond a search of outer clothing and belongings.\n   Savana’s subjective expectation of privacy against such\na search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing,\nfrightening, and humiliating. The reasonableness of her\nexpectation (required by the Fourth Amendment stan\ndard) is indicated by the consistent experiences of other\nyoung people similarly searched, whose adolescent vulner\nability intensifies the patent intrusiveness of the exposure.\nSee Brief for National Association of Social Workers et al.\nas Amici Curiae 6–14; Hyman & Perone, The Other Side of\nSchool Violence: Educator Policies and Practices that may\nContribute to Student Misbehavior, 36 J.

No.\nA–432, p. 2 (2005), online at http://docs.nycenet.edu/\ndocushare/dsweb/Get/Document-21/A-432.pdf (“Under no\ncircumstances shall a strip-search of a student be\nconducted”).\n   The indignity of the search does not, of course, outlaw it,\nbut it does implicate the rule of reasonableness as stated\nin T. L. O., that “the search as actually conducted [be]\nreasonably related in scope to the circumstances which\njustified the interference in the first place.” 469 U. S., at\n341 (internal quotation marks omitted). The scope will be\npermissible, that is, when it is “not excessively intrusive in\nlight of the age and sex of the student and the nature of\nthe infraction.” Id., at 342.\n   Here, the content of the suspicion failed to match the\ndegree of intrusion. Wilson knew beforehand that the pills\nwere prescription-strength ibuprofen and over-the-counter\nnaproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil,\nor one Aleve.4 He must have been aware of the nature and\nlimited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for,\nand while just about anything can be taken in quantities\nthat will do real harm, Wilson had no reason to suspect\n\n——————\n  4 AnAdvil tablet, caplet, or gel caplet, contains 200 mg of ibuprofen.\nSee Physicians’ Desk Reference for Nonprescription Drugs, Dietary\nSupplements, and Herbs 674 (28th ed. 2006). An Aleve caplet contains\n200 mg naproxen and 20 mg sodium. See id., at 675.\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat large amounts of the drugs were being passed around,\nor that individual students were receiving great numbers\nof pills.\n   Nor could Wilson have suspected that Savana was\nhiding common painkillers in her underwear. Petitioners\nsuggest, as a truth universally acknowledged, that “stu\ndents . . . hid[e] contraband in or under their clothing,”\nReply Brief for Petitioners 8, and cite a smattering of\ncases of students with contraband in their underwear, id.,\nat 8–9. But when the categorically extreme intrusiveness\nof a search down to the body of an adolescent requires\nsome justification in suspected facts, general background\npossibilities fall short; a reasonable search that extensive\ncalls for suspicion that it will pay off. But nondangerous\nschool contraband does not raise the specter of stashes in\nintimate places, and there is no evidence in the record of\nany general practice among Safford Middle School stu\ndents of hiding that sort of thing in underwear; neither\nJordan nor Marissa suggested to Wilson that Savana was\ndoing that, and the preceding search of Marissa that\nWilson ordered yielded nothing. Wilson never even de\ntermined when Marissa had received the pills from Sa\nvana; if it had been a few days before, that would weigh\nheavily against any reasonable conclusion that Savana\npresently had the pills on her person, much less in her\nunderwear.\n   In sum, what was missing from the suspected facts that\npointed to Savana was any indication of danger to the\nstudents from the power of the drugs or their quantity,\nand any reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills\nin her underwear. We think that the combination of these\ndeficiencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable.\n   In so holding, we mean to cast no ill reflection on the\nassistant principal, for the record raises no doubt that his\nmotive throughout was to eliminate drugs from his school\nand protect students from what Jordan Romero had gone\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough. Parents are known to overreact to protect their\nchildren from danger, and a school official with responsi\nbility for safety may tend to do the same. The difference is\nthat the Fourth Amendment places limits on the official,\neven with the high degree of deference that courts must\npay to the educator’s professional judgment.\n   We do mean, though, to make it clear that the T. L. O.\nconcern to limit a school search to reasonable scope re\nquires the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of\nresort to underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing\nbefore a search can reasonably make the quantum leap\nfrom outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate\nparts. The meaning of such a search, and the degradation\nits subject may reasonably feel, place a search that intru\nsive in a category of its own demanding its own specific\nsuspicions.\n                               IV\n   A school official searching a student is “entitled to quali\nfied immunity where clearly established law does not show\nthat the search violated the Fourth Amendment.” Pearson\nv. Callahan, 555 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op., at 18). To be\nestablished clearly, however, there is no need that “the\nvery action in question [have] previously been held unlaw\nful.” Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999). The\nunconstitutionality of outrageous conduct obviously will be\nunconstitutional, this being the reason, as Judge Posner\nhas said, that “[t]he easiest cases don’t even arise.” K. H.\nv. Morgan, 914 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA7 1990). But even as to\naction less than an outrage, “officials can still be on notice\nthat their conduct violates established law . . . in novel\nfactual circumstances.” Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 741\n(2002).\n   T. L. O. directed school officials to limit the intrusive\nness of a search, “in light of the age and sex of the student\nand the nature of the infraction,” 469 U. S., at 342, and as\n12     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwe have just said at some length, the intrusiveness of the\nstrip search here cannot be seen as justifiably related to\nthe circumstances. But we realize that the lower courts\nhave reached divergent conclusions regarding how the\nT. L. O. standard applies to such searches.\n  A number of judges have read T. L. O. as the en banc\nminority of the Ninth Circuit did here. The Sixth Circuit\nupheld a strip search of a high school student for a drug,\nwithout any suspicion that drugs were hidden next to her\nbody. Williams v. Ellington, 936 F. 2d 881, 882–883, 887\n(1991). And other courts considering qualified immunity\nfor strip searches have read T. L. O. as “a series of ab\nstractions, on the one hand, and a declaration of seeming\ndeference to the judgments of school officials, on the\nother,” Jenkins v. Talladega City Bd. of Ed., 115 F. 3d 821,\n828 (CA11 1997) (en banc), which made it impossible “to\nestablish clearly the contours of a Fourth Amendment\nright . . . [in] the wide variety of possible school settings\ndifferent from those involved in T. L. O.” itself. Ibid. See\nalso Thomas v. Roberts, 323 F. 3d 950 (CA11 2003) (grant\ning qualified immunity to a teacher and police officer who\nconducted a group strip search of a fifth grade class when\nlooking for a missing $26).\n  We think these differences of opinion from our own are\nsubstantial enough to require immunity for the school\nofficials in this case. We would not suggest that entitle\nment to qualified immunity is the guaranteed product of\ndisuniform views of the law in the other federal, or state,\ncourts, and the fact that a single judge, or even a group of\njudges, disagrees about the contours of a right does not\nautomatically render the law unclear if we have been\nclear. That said, however, the cases viewing school strip\nsearches differently from the way we see them are numer\nous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting\nopinions, to counsel doubt that we were sufficiently clear\nin the prior statement of law. We conclude that qualified\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

Our\nconclusions here do not resolve, however, the question of\nthe liability of petitioner Safford Unified School District #1\nunder Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436\nU. S. 658, 694 (1978), a claim the Ninth Circuit did not\naddress. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is therefore\naffirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is\nremanded for consideration of the Monell claim.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

First, the Court explained, the search must be\n“ ‘justified at its inception’ ” by the presence of “reasonable\ngrounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evi\ndence that the student has violated or is violating either\nthe law or the rules of the school.” Id., at 342. Second, the\nsearch must be “permissible in its scope,” which is\nachieved “when the measures adopted are reasonably\nrelated to the objectives of the search and not excessively\nintrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the\nnature of the infraction.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n    Nothing the Court decides today alters this basic\nframework. It simply applies T. L. O. to declare unconsti\ntutional a strip search of a 13-year-old honors student that\nwas based on a groundless suspicion that she might be\nhiding medicine in her underwear. This is, in essence, a\ncase in which clearly established law meets clearly outra\ngeous conduct. I have long believed that “ ‘[i]t does not\nrequire a constitutional scholar to conclude that a nude\nsearch of a 13-year-old child is an invasion of constitu\ntional rights of some magnitude.’ ” Id., at 382, n. 25\n2       SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(quoting Doe v. Renfrow, 631 F. 2d 91, 92–93 (CA7 1980)).\nThe strip search of Savana Redding in this case was both\nmore intrusive and less justified than the search of the\nstudent’s purse in T. L. O. Therefore, while I join Parts I–\nIII of the Court’s opinion, I disagree with its decision to\nextend qualified immunity to the school official who au\nthorized this unconstitutional search.\n   The Court reaches a contrary conclusion about qualified\nimmunity based on the fact that various Courts of Appeals\nhave adopted seemingly divergent views about T. L. O.’s\napplication to strip searches. Ante, at 12. But the clarity\nof a well-established right should not depend on whether\njurists have misread our precedents. And while our cases\nhave previously noted the “divergence of views” among\ncourts in deciding whether to extend qualified immunity,\ne.g., Pearson v. Callahan, (2009) 555 U. S., ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 20) (noting the unsettled constitutionality of the so\ncalled “consent-once-removed” doctrine); Wilson v. Layne,\n526 U. S. 603, 618 (1999) (considering conflicting views on\nthe constitutionality of law enforcement’s practice of al\nlowing the media to enter a private home to observe and\nfilm attempted arrests), we have relied on that considera\ntion only to spare officials from having “ ‘to predict the\nfuture course of constitutional law,’ ” Id., at 617 (quoting\nProcunier v. Navarette, 434 U. S. 555, 562 (1978); empha\nsis added). In this case, by contrast, we chart no new\nconstitutional path. We merely decide whether the deci\nsion to strip search Savana Redding, on these facts, was\nprohibited under T. L. O. Our conclusion leaves the\nboundaries of the law undisturbed.*\n——————\n  * In fact, in T. L. O. we cited with approval a Ninth Circuit case, Bil\nbrey v. Brown, 738 F. 2d 1462 (1984), which held that a strip search\nperformed under similar circumstances violated the Constitution. New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.

But I\nalso agree with JUSTICE STEVENS, ante, at 1–2, that our\nopinion in New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985),\n“clearly established” the law governing this case.\n   Fellow student Marissa Glines, caught with pills in her\npocket, accused Redding of supplying them. App. 13a.\nAsked where the blue pill among several white pills in\nGlines’s pocket came from, Glines answered: “I guess it\nslipped in when she gave me the IBU 400s.” Ibid. Asked\nnext “who is she?”, Glines responded: “Savana Redding.”\nIbid. As the Court observes, ante, at 6, 10, no followup\nquestions were asked. Wilson did not test Glines’s accusa\ntion for veracity by asking Glines when did Redding give\nher the pills, where, for what purpose. Any reasonable\nsearch for the pills would have ended when inspection of\nRedding’s backpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing.\nWilson had no cause to suspect, based on prior experience\nat the school or clues in this case, that Redding had hid\nden pills—containing the equivalent of two Advils or one\nAleve—in her underwear or body. To make matters\nworse, Wilson did not release Redding, to return to class\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                    Opinion of GINSBURG, J.\n\nor to go home, after the search. Instead, he made her sit\non a chair outside his office for over two hours. At no\npoint did he attempt to call her parent. Abuse of authority\nof that order should not be shielded by official immunity.\n   In contrast to T. L. O., where a teacher discovered a\nstudent smoking in the lavatory, and where the search\nwas confined to the student’s purse, the search of Redding\ninvolved her body and rested on the bare accusation of\nanother student whose reliability the Assistant Principal\nhad no reason to trust. The Court’s opinion in T. L. O.\nplainly stated the controlling Fourth Amendment law: A\nsearch ordered by a school official, even if “justified at its\ninception,” crosses the constitutional boundary if it be\ncomes “excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of\nthe student and the nature of the infraction.” 469 U. S., at\n342 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Here, “the nature of the [supposed] infraction,” the slim\nbasis for suspecting Savana Redding, and her “age and\nsex,” ibid., establish beyond doubt that Assistant Principal\nWilson’s order cannot be reconciled with this Court’s\nopinion in T. L. O. Wilson’s treatment of Redding was\nabusive and it was not reasonable for him to believe that\nthe law permitted it.

See ante, at 11–13. Unlike the majority,\nhowever, I would hold that the search of Savana Redding\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment. The majority\nimposes a vague and amorphous standard on school ad\nministrators. It also grants judges sweeping authority to\nsecond-guess the measures that these officials take to\nmaintain discipline in their schools and ensure the health\nand safety of the students in their charge. This deep\nintrusion into the administration of public schools exem\nplifies why the Court should return to the common-law\ndoctrine of in loco parentis under which “the judiciary was\nreluctant to interfere in the routine business of school\nadministration, allowing schools and teachers to set and\nenforce rules and to maintain order.” Morse v. Frederick,\n551 U. S. 393, 414 (2007) (THOMAS, J., concurring). But\neven under the prevailing Fourth Amendment test estab\nlished by New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325 (1985), all\npetitioners, including the school district, are entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law in their favor.\n2      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n                               I\n  “Although the underlying command of the Fourth\nAmendment is always that searches and seizures be rea\nsonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within\nwhich a search takes place.” Id., at 337. Thus, although\npublic school students retain Fourth Amendment rights\nunder this Court’s precedent, see id., at 333–337, those\nrights “are different . . . than elsewhere; the ‘reasonable\nness’ inquiry cannot disregard the schools’ custodial and\ntutelary responsibility for children,” Vernonia School Dist.\n47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 656 (1995); see also T. L. O.,\n469 U. S., at 339 (identifying “the substantial interest of\nteachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in\nthe classroom and on school grounds”). For nearly 25\nyears this Court has understood that “[m]aintaining order\nin the classroom has never been easy, but in more recent\nyears, school disorder has often taken particularly ugly\nforms: drug use and violent crime in the schools have\nbecome major social problems.” Ibid. In schools, “[e]vents\ncalling for discipline are frequent occurrences and some\ntimes require immediate, effective action.” Goss v. Lopez,\n419 U. S. 565, 580 (1975); see also T. L. O., 469 U. S., at\n340 (explaining that schools have a “legitimate need to\nmaintain an environment in which learning can take\nplace”).\n  For this reason, school officials retain broad authority\nto protect students and preserve “order and a proper\neducational environment” under the Fourth Amendment.\nId., at 339. This authority requires that school officials be\nable to engage in the “close supervision of schoolchildren,\nas well as . . . enforc[e] rules against conduct that would\nbe perfectly permissible if undertaken by an adult.” Ibid.\nSeeking to reconcile the Fourth Amendment with this\nunique public school setting, the Court in T. L. O. held\nthat a school search is “reasonable” if it is “ ‘justified at its\ninception’ ” and “ ‘reasonably related in scope to the cir\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ncumstances which justified the interference in the first\nplace.’ ” Id., at 341–342 (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S.\n1, 20 (1968)). The search under review easily meets this\nstandard.\n                                A\n  A “search of a student by a teacher or other school offi\ncial will be ‘justified at its inception’ when there are rea\nsonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn\nup evidence that the student has violated or is violating\neither the law or the rules of the school.” T. L. O., supra,\nat 341–342 (footnote omitted). As the majority rightly\nconcedes, this search was justified at its inception because\nthere were reasonable grounds to suspect that Redding\npossessed medication that violated school rules. See ante,\nat 7. A finding of reasonable suspicion “does not deal with\nhard certainties, but with probabilities.” United States v.\nCortez, 449 U. S. 411, 418 (1981); see also T. L. O., supra,\nat 346 (“[T]he requirement of reasonable suspicion is not a\nrequirement of absolute certainty”). To satisfy this stan\ndard, more than a mere “hunch” of wrongdoing is required,\nbut “considerably” less suspicion is needed than would be\nrequired to “satisf[y] a preponderance of the evidence\nstandard.” United States v. Arvizu, 534 U. S. 266, 274\n(2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  Furthermore, in evaluating whether there is a reason\nable “particularized and objective” basis for conducting a\nsearch based on suspected wrongdoing, government offi\ncials must consider the “totality of the circumstances.” Id.,\nat 273 (internal quotation marks omitted). School officials\nhave a specialized understanding of the school environ\nment, the habits of the students, and the concerns of the\ncommunity, which enables them to “ ‘formulat[e] certain\ncommon-sense conclusions about human behavior.’ ”\nUnited States v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 8 (1989) (quoting\nCortez, supra, at 418). And like police officers, school\n4      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nofficials are “entitled to make an assessment of the situa\ntion in light of [this] specialized training and familiarity\nwith the customs of the [school].” See Arvizu, supra, at\n276.\n   Here, petitioners had reasonable grounds to suspect\nthat Redding was in possession of prescription and non\nprescription drugs in violation of the school’s prohibition of\nthe “non-medical use, possession, or sale of a drug” on\nschool property or at school events. 531 F. 3d 1071, 1076\n(CA9 2008) (en banc); see also id., at 1107 (Hawkins, J.,\ndissenting) (explaining that the school policy defined\n“drugs” to include “ ‘[a]ny prescription or over-the-counter\ndrug, except those for which permission to use in school\nhas been granted’ ”). As an initial matter, school officials\nwere aware that a few years earlier, a student had become\n“seriously ill” and “spent several days in intensive care”\nafter ingesting prescription medication obtained from a\nclassmate. App. 10a. Fourth Amendment searches do not\noccur in a vacuum; rather, context must inform the judi\ncial inquiry. See Cortez, supra, at 417–418. In this in\nstance, the suspicion of drug possession arose at a middle\nschool that had “a history of problems with students using\nand distributing prohibited and illegal substances on\ncampus.” App. 7a, 10a.\n   The school’s substance-abuse problems had not abated\nby the 2003–2004 school year, which is when the chal\nlenged search of Redding took place. School officials had\nfound alcohol and cigarettes in the girls’ bathroom during\nthe first school dance of the year and noticed that a group\nof students including Redding and Marissa Glines smelled\nof alcohol. Ibid. Several weeks later, another student,\nJordan Romero, reported that Redding had hosted a party\nbefore the dance where she served whiskey, vodka, and\ntequila. Id., at 8a, 11a. Romero had provided this report\nto school officials as a result of a meeting his mother\nscheduled with the officials after Romero “bec[a]me vio\n                    Cite as: 557 U.

At that meeting,\nRomero admitted that “certain students were bringing\ndrugs and weapons on campus.” Id., at 8a, 11a. One week\nlater, Romero handed the assistant principal a white pill\nthat he said he had received from Glines. Id., at 11a. He\nreported “that a group of students [were] planning on\ntaking the pills at lunch.” Ibid.\n   School officials justifiably took quick action in light of\nthe lunchtime deadline. The assistant principal took the\npill to the school nurse who identified it as prescription\nstrength 400-mg Ibuprofen. Id., at 12a. A subsequent\nsearch of Glines and her belongings produced a razor\nblade, a Naproxen 200-mg pill, and several Ibuprofen 400\nmg pills. Id., at 13a. When asked, Glines claimed that\nshe had received the pills from Redding. Ibid. A search of\nRedding’s planner, which Glines had borrowed, then un\ncovered “several knives, several lighters, a cigarette, and a\npermanent marker.” Id., at 12a, 14a, 22a. Thus, as the\nmajority acknowledges, ante, at 7, the totality of relevant\ncircumstances justified a search of Redding for pills.1\n                            B\n  The remaining question is whether the search was\nreasonable in scope. Under T. L. O., “a search will be\npermissible in its scope when the measures adopted are\nreasonably related to the objectives of the search and not\nexcessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the\n\n——————\n  1 To be sure, Redding denied knowledge of the pills and the materials\n\nin her planner. App. 14a. But her denial alone does not negate the\nreasonable suspicion held by school officials. See New Jersey v.\nT. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 345 (1985) (finding search reasonable even\nthough “T. L. O. had been accused of smoking, and had denied the\naccusation in the strongest possible terms when she stated that she did\nnot smoke at all”).\n6        SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nstudent and the nature of the infraction.” 469 U. S., at\n342. The majority concludes that the school officials’\nsearch of Redding’s underwear was not “ ‘reasonably re\nlated in scope to the circumstances which justified the\ninterference in the first place,’ ” see ante, at 8–11, notwith\nstanding the officials’ reasonable suspicion that Redding\n“was involved in pill distribution,” ante, at 7. According to\nthe majority, to be reasonable, this school search required\na showing of “danger to the students from the power of the\ndrugs or their quantity” or a “reason to suppose that [Red\nding] was carrying pills in her underwear.” Ante, at 10.\nEach of these additional requirements is an unjustifiable\ndeparture from bedrock Fourth Amendment law in the\nschool setting, where this Court has heretofore read the\nFourth Amendment to grant considerable leeway to school\nofficials. Because the school officials searched in a loca\ntion where the pills could have been hidden, the search\nwas reasonable in scope under T. L. O.\n                                     1\n  The majority finds that “subjective and reasonable\nsocietal expectations of personal privacy support . . .\ntreat[ing]” this type of search, which it labels a “strip\nsearch,” as “categorically distinct, requiring distinct ele\nments of justification on the part of school authorities for\ngoing beyond a search of clothing and belongings.” Ante,\nat 8.2 Thus, in the majority’s view, although the school\nofficials had reasonable suspicion to believe that Redding\n——————\n   2 Like the dissent below, “I would reserve the term ‘strip search’ for a\n\nsearch that required its subject to fully disrobe in view of officials.” 531\nF. 3d 1071, 1091, n. 1 (CA9 2008) (opinion of Hawkins, J.). The distinc\ntion between a strip search and the search at issue in this case may be\nslight, but it is a distinction that the law has drawn. See, e.g., Sandin\nv. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 475 (1995) (“The officer subjected Conner to a\nstrip search, complete with inspection of the rectal area”); Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558, and n. 39 (1979) (describing visual inspec\ntion of body cavities as “part of a strip search”).\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

See, e.g., Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295,\n307 (1999) (Police officers “may inspect passengers’ be\nlongings found in the car that are capable of concealing\nthe object of the search”); Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U. S. 248,\n251 (1991) (“The scope of a search is generally defined by\nits expressed object”); United States v. Johns, 469 U. S.\n478, 487 (1985) (search reasonable because “there is no\nplausible argument that the object of the search could not\nhave been concealed in the packages”); United States v.\nRoss, 456 U. S. 798, 820 (1982) (“A lawful search . . . gen\nerally extends to the entire area in which the object of the\nsearch may be found”).3\n   In keeping with this longstanding rule, the “nature of\nthe infraction” referenced in T. L. O. delineates the proper\nscope of a search of students in a way that is identical to\nthat permitted for searches outside the school—i.e., the\nsearch must be limited to the areas where the object of\nthat infraction could be concealed. See Horton v. Califor\nnia, 496 U. S. 128, 141 (1990) (“Police with a warrant for a\nrifle may search only places where rifles might be” (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)); Ross, supra, at 824\n(“[P]robable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are\nbeing transported in a van will not justify a warrantless\n——————\n  3 The Court has adopted a different standard for searches involving\n\nan “intrusio[n] into the human body.” Schmerber v. California, 384\nU. S. 757, 770 (1966). The search here does not implicate the Court’s\ncases governing bodily intrusions, however, because it did not involve a\n“physical intrusion, penetrating beneath the skin,” Skinner v. Railway\nLabor Executives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 616 (1989).\n8      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nsearch of a suitcase”). A search of a student therefore is\npermissible in scope under T. L. O. so long as it is objec\ntively reasonable to believe that the area searched could\nconceal the contraband. The dissenting opinion below\ncorrectly captured this Fourth Amendment standard,\nnoting that “if a student brought a baseball bat on campus\nin violation of school policy, a search of that student’s shirt\npocket would be patently unjustified.” 531 F. 3d, at 1104\n(opinion of Hawkins, J.).\n   The analysis of whether the scope of the search here was\npermissible under that standard is straightforward.\nIndeed, the majority does not dispute that “general back\nground possibilities” establish that students conceal “con\ntraband in their underwear.” Ante, at 10. It acknowledges\nthat school officials had reasonable suspicion to look in\nRedding’s backpack and outer clothing because if “Wilson’s\nreasonable suspicion of pill distribution were not under\nstood to support searches of outer clothes and backpack, it\nwould not justify any search worth making.” Ante, at 7.\nThe majority nevertheless concludes that proceeding any\nfurther with the search was unreasonable. See ante, at 8–\n10; see also ante, at 1 (GINSBURG, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part) (“Any reasonable search for the\npills would have ended when inspection of Redding’s\nbackpack and jacket pockets yielded nothing”). But there\nis no support for this conclusion. The reasonable suspicion\nthat Redding possessed the pills for distribution purposes\ndid not dissipate simply because the search of her back\npack turned up nothing. It was eminently reasonable to\nconclude that the backpack was empty because Redding\nwas secreting the pills in a place she thought no one would\nlook. See Ross, supra, at 820 (“Contraband goods rarely\nare strewn” about in plain view; “by their very nature such\ngoods must be withheld from public view”).\n   Redding would not have been the first person to conceal\npills in her undergarments.

According to the majority, the scope of\nthe search was impermissible because the school official\n“must have been aware of the nature and limited threat of\nthe specific drugs he was searching for” and because he\n“had no reason to suspect that large amounts of the drugs\nwere being passed around, or that individual students\nwere receiving great numbers of pills.” Ante, at 9–10.\nThus, in order to locate a rationale for finding a Fourth\nAmendment violation in this case, the majority retreats\nfrom its observation that the school’s firm no-drug policy\n“makes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the\nsearch was unreasonable owing to some defect or short\n10     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ncoming of the rule it was aimed at enforcing.” Ante, at 5,\nn. 1.\n   Even accepting the majority’s assurances that it is not\nattacking the rule’s reasonableness, it certainly is attack\ning the rule’s importance. This approach directly conflicts\nwith T. L. O. in which the Court was “unwilling to adopt a\nstandard under which the legality of a search is dependent\nupon a judge’s evaluation of the relative importance of\nschool rules.” 469 U. S., at 342, n. 9. Indeed, the Court in\nT. L. O. expressly rejected the proposition that the major\nity seemingly endorses—that “some rules regarding stu\ndent conduct are by nature too ‘trivial’ to justify a search\nbased upon reasonable suspicion.” Ibid.; see also id., at\n343, n. 9 (“The promulgation of a rule forbidding specified\nconduct presumably reflects a judgment on the part of\nschool officials that such conduct is destructive of school\norder or of a proper educational environment. Absent any\nsuggestion that the rule violates some substantive consti\ntutional guarantee, the courts should as a general matter,\ndefer to that judgment”).\n   The majority’s decision in this regard also departs from\nanother basic principle of the Fourth Amendment: that\nlaw enforcement officials can enforce with the same vigor\nall rules and regulations irrespective of the perceived\nimportance of any of those rules. “In a long line of cases,\nwe have said that when an officer has probable cause to\nbelieve a person committed even a minor crime in his\npresence, the balancing of private and public interests is\nnot in doubt. The arrest is constitutionally reasonable.”\nVirginia v. Moore, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6).\nThe Fourth Amendment rule for searches is the same:\nPolice officers are entitled to search regardless of the\nperceived triviality of the underlying law. As we have\nexplained, requiring police to make “sensitive, case-by\ncase determinations of government need,” Atwater v. Lago\nVista, 532 U.

Had the suspected infraction involved a\nstreet drug, the majority implies that it would have ap\nproved the scope of the search. See ante, at 9 (relying on\nthe “limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching\nfor”); ante, at 10 (relying on the limited “power of the\ndrugs” involved). In effect, then, the majority has replaced\na school rule that draws no distinction among drugs with a\nnew one that does. As a result, a full search of a student’s\nperson for prohibited drugs will be permitted only if the\nCourt agrees that the drug in question was sufficiently\ndangerous. Such a test is unworkable and unsound.\nSchool officials cannot be expected to halt searches based\non the possibility that a court might later find that the\nparticular infraction at issue is not severe enough to war\nrant an intrusive investigation.4\n——————\n  4 JUSTICE  GINSBURG suggests that requiring Redding to “sit on a chair\noutside [the assistant principal’s] office for over two hours” and failing\nto call her parents before conducting the search constitutes an “[a]buse\nof authority” that “should not be shielded by official immunity.” See\nante, at 1–2. But the school was under no constitutional obligation to\ncall Redding’s parents before conducting the search: “[R]easonableness\nunder the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least\nintrusive means, because the logic of such elaborate less-restrictive\nalternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise\nof virtually all search-and-seizure powers.” Board of Ed. of Independ\nent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 837\n(2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). For the same\nreason, the Constitution did not require school officials to ask “followup\nquestions” after they had already developed reasonable suspicion that\nRedding possessed drugs. See ante, at 6, 10 (majority opinion); ante, at\n1 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). In any event, the suggestion that requiring\nRedding to sit in a chair for two hours amounted to a deprivation of her\nconstitutional rights, or that school officials are required to engage in\n12      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                        Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   A rule promulgated by a school board represents the\njudgment of school officials that the rule is needed to\nmaintain “school order” and “a proper educational envi\nronment.” T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 343, n. 9. Teachers,\nadministrators, and the local school board are called upon\nboth to “protect the . . . safety of students and school per\nsonnel” and “maintain an environment conducive to learn\ning.” Id., at 353 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).\nThey are tasked with “watch[ing] over a large number of\nstudents” who “are inclined to test the outer boundaries of\nacceptable conduct and to imitate the misbehavior of a\npeer if that misbehavior is not dealt with quickly.” Id., at\n352. In such an environment, something as simple as a\n“water pistol or peashooter can wreak [havoc] until it is\ntaken away.” Ibid. The danger posed by unchecked dis\ntribution and consumption of prescription pills by students\ncertainly needs no elaboration.\n   Judges are not qualified to second-guess the best man\nner for maintaining quiet and order in the school envi\nronment. Such institutional judgments, like those con\ncerning the selection of the best methods for “restrain[ing\nstudents] from assaulting one another, abusing drugs and\nalcohol, and committing other crimes,” id., at 342, n. 9,\n“involve a host of policy choices that must be made by\nlocally elected representatives, rather than by federal\njudges interpreting the basic charter of Government for\nthe entire country.” Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S.\n115, 129 (1992); cf. Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474\nU.

It is a mistake for judges to assume the\nresponsibility for deciding which school rules are impor\ntant enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules\nare not.\n                               3\n   Even if this Court were authorized to second-guess the\nimportance of school rules, the Court’s assessment of the\nimportance of this district’s policy is flawed. It is a crime\nto possess or use prescription-strength Ibuprofen without\na prescription. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–3406(A)(1)\n(West Supp. 2008) (“A person shall not knowingly . . .\n[p]ossess or use a prescription-only drug unless the person\nobtains the prescription-only drug pursuant to a valid\nprescription of a prescriber who is licensed pursuant to\n[state law]”).5 By prohibiting unauthorized prescription\ndrugs on school grounds—and conducting a search to\nensure students abide by that prohibition—the school rule\nhere was consistent with a routine provision of the state\ncriminal code. It hardly seems unreasonable for school\nofficials to enforce a rule that, in effect, proscribes conduct\n\nthat amounts to a crime. \n\n—————— \n\n   5 Arizona’s law is not idiosyncratic; many States have separately\n\ncriminalized the unauthorized possession of prescription drugs. See,\ne.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. §577.628(1) (Supp. 2008) (“No person less than\ntwenty-one years of age shall possess upon the real property comprising\na public or private elementary or secondary school or school bus pre\nscription medication without a valid prescription for such medication”);\nOkla.

REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   Moreover, school districts have valid reasons for punish\ning the unauthorized possession of prescription drugs on\nschool property as severely as the possession of street\ndrugs; “[t]eenage abuse of over-the-counter and prescrip\ntion drugs poses an increasingly alarming national crisis.”\nGet Teens Off Drugs, The Education Digest 75 (Dec. 2006).\nAs one study noted, “more young people ages 12–17 abuse\nprescription drugs than any illicit drug except mari\njuana—more than cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine\ncombined.” Executive Office of the President, Office of\nNational Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Prescription for\nDanger 1 (Jan. 2008) (hereinafter Prescription for Dan\nger). And according to a 2005 survey of teens, “nearly one\nin five (19 percent or 4.5 million) admit abusing prescrip\ntion drugs in their lifetime.” Columbia University, The\nNational Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse\n(CASA), “You’ve Got Drugs!” V: Prescription Drug Pushers\non the Internet 2 (July 2008); see also Dept. of Health and\nHuman Services, National Institute on Drug Abuse, High\nSchool and Youth Trends 2 (Dec. 2008) (“In 2008, 15.4\npercent of 12th-graders reported using a prescription drug\nnonmedically within the past year”).\n   School administrators can reasonably conclude that this\nhigh rate of drug abuse is being fueled, at least in part, by\nthe increasing presence of prescription drugs on school\ncampuses. See, e.g., Gibson, Grand Forks Schools See Rise\nIn Prescription Drug Abuse, Grand Forks Herald, Nov. 16,\n2008, p. 1 (explaining that “prescription drug abuse is\ngrowing into a larger problem” as students “bring them to\nschool and sell them or just give them to their friends”).\nIn a 2008 survey, “44 percent of teens sa[id] drugs are\nused, kept or sold on the grounds of their schools.” CASA,\nNational Survey of American Attitudes on Substance\nAbuse XIII: Teens and Parents 19 (Aug. 2008) (hereinafter\nNational Survey).

But since 1999,\nthere has “been a dramatic increase in the number of\npoisonings and even deaths associated with the abuse of\nprescription drugs.” Prescription for Danger 4; see also\nDept. of Health and Human Services, The NSDUH Report:\nTrends in Nonmedical Use of Prescription Pain Relievers:\n2002 to 2007, p. 1 (Feb. 5, 2009) (“[A]pproximately 324,000\nemergency department visits in 2006 involved the non\nmedical use of pain relievers”); CASA, Under the Counter:\nThe Diversion and Abuse of Controlled Prescription Drugs\nin the U.

At least some of these injuries and\ndeaths are likely due to the fact that “[m]ost controlled\nprescription drug abusers are poly-substance abusers,” id.,\nat 3, a habit that is especially likely to result in deadly\ndrug combinations. Furthermore, even if a child is not\nimmediately harmed by the abuse of prescription drugs,\nresearch suggests that prescription drugs have become\n“gateway drugs to other substances of abuse.” Id., at 4;\nHealy, Skipping the Street, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 15,\n2008, p. F1 (“Boomers made marijuana their ‘gateway’ . . .\nbut a younger generation finds prescription drugs an\neasier score”); see also National Survey 17 (noting that\nteens report “that prescription drugs are easier to buy\nthan beer”).\n  Admittedly, the Ibuprofen and Naproxen at issue in this\ncase are not the prescription painkillers at the forefront of\nthe prescription-drug-abuse problem. See Prescription for\n16      SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                        Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nDanger 3 (“Pain relievers like Vicodin and OxyContin are\nthe prescription drugs most commonly abused by teens”).\nBut they are not without their own dangers. As nonster\noidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they pose a risk of\ndeath from overdose. The Pill Book 821, 827 (H. Silverman,\ned., 13th ed. 2008) (observing that Ibuprofen and Naproxen\nare NSAIDs and “[p]eople have died from NSAID over\ndoses”). Moreover, the side-effects caused by the use of\nNSAIDs can be magnified if they are taken in combination\nwith other drugs. See, e.g., Reactions Weekly, p. 18 (Issue\nno. 1235, Jan. 17, 2009) (“A 17-year-old girl developed\nallergic interstitial nephritis and renal failure while re\nceiving escitalopram and ibuprofen”); id., at 26 (Issue no.\n1232, Dec. 13, 2008) (“A 16-month-old boy developed iron\ndeficiency anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia during treat\nment with naproxen”); id., at 15 (Issue no. 1220, Sept. 20,\n2008) (18-year-old “was diagnosed with pill-induced oeso\nphageal perforation” after taking ibuprofen “and was\nadmitted to the [intensive care unit]”); id., at 20 (Issue no.\n1170, Sept. 22, 2007) (“A 12-year-old boy developed ana\nphylaxis following ingestion of ibuprofen”).\n  If a student with a previously unknown intolerance to\nIbuprofen or Naproxen were to take either drug and be\ncome ill, the public outrage would likely be directed to\nward the school for failing to take steps to prevent the\nunmonitored use of the drug. In light of the risks in\nvolved, a school’s decision to establish and enforce a school\nprohibition on the possession of any unauthorized drug is\nthus a reasonable judgment.6\n——————\n  6 Schools have a significant interest in protecting all students from\n\nprescription drug abuse; young female students are no exception. See\nTeens and Prescription Drugs 2 (“Prescription drugs are the most\ncommonly abused drug among 12–13-year-olds”).

Reasonable suspicion\nthat Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of\nthese policies, therefore, justified a search extending to\nany area where small pills could be concealed. The search\ndid not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n                              II\n   By declaring the search unreasonable in this case, the\nmajority has “ ‘surrender[ed] control of the American\npublic school system to public school students’ ” by invali\ndating school policies that treat all drugs equally and by\nsecond-guessing swift disciplinary decisions made by\nschool officials. See Morse, 551 U. S., at 421 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring) (quoting Tinker v. Des Moines Independent\nCommunity School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 526 (1969) (Black,\nJ., dissenting)). The Court’s interference in these matters\nof great concern to teachers, parents, and students illus\ntrates why the most constitutionally sound approach to\nthe question of applying the Fourth Amendment in local\npublic schools would in fact be the complete restoration of\nthe common-law doctrine of in loco parentis.\n   “[I]n the early years of public schooling,” courts applied\nthe doctrine of in loco parentis to transfer to teachers the\nauthority of a parent to “ ‘command obedience, to control\nstubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad\nhabits.’ ” Morse, supra, at 413–414 (THOMAS, J., concur\n\n—————— \n\nrelevant governmental interest here, Redding’s age and sex, if any\n\nthing, increased the need for a search to prevent the reasonably sus\n\npected use of prescription drugs. \n\n18        SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v.

So empowered, schoolteachers and administrators\nhad almost complete discretion to establish and enforce\nthe rules they believed were necessary to maintain control\nover their classrooms. See 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on\nAmerican Law 205 (1873) (“So the power allowed by law to\nthe parent over the person of the child may be delegated to\na tutor or instructor, the better to accomplish the purpose\nof education”); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 441 (1765) (“He may also delegate part of\nhis parental authority, during his life, to the tutor or\nschoolmaster of his child; who is then in loco parentis, and\nhas such a portion of the parent committed to his charge,\nviz. that of restraint and correction, as may be necessary\nto answer the purposes for which he is employed”).7 The\nperils of judicial policymaking inherent in applying Fourth\nAmendment protections to public schools counsel in favor\nof a return to the understanding that existed in this Na\ntion’s first public schools, which gave teachers discretion\nto craft the rules needed to carry out the disciplinary\nresponsibilities delegated to them by parents.\n   If the common-law view that parents delegate to teach\ners their authority to discipline and maintain order were\nto be applied in this case, the search of Redding would\nstand. There can be no doubt that a parent would have\nhad the authority to conduct the search at issue in this\ncase. Parents have “immunity from the strictures of the\nFourth Amendment” when it comes to searches of a child\n——————\n  7 The one aspect of school discipline with respect to which the judici\nary at times became involved was the “imposition of excessive physical\npunishment.” Morse, 551 U.

Geor\ngia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 114 (2006). In light of this\nrelationship, the Court has indicated that a parent can\nauthorize a third-party search of a child by consenting to\nsuch a search, even if the child denies his consent. See\nibid.; see also 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §8.3(d), p.\n160 (4th ed. 2004) (“[A] father, as the head of the house\nhold with the responsibility and the authority for the\ndiscipline, training and control of his children, has a supe\nrior interest in the family residence to that of his minor\nson, so that the father’s consent to search would be effec\ntive notwithstanding the son’s contemporaneous on-the\nscene objection” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nCertainly, a search by the parent himself is no different,\nregardless of whether or not a child would prefer to be left\nalone. See id., §8.4(b), at 202 (“[E]ven [if] a minor child\n. . . may think of a room as ‘his,’ the overall dominance will\nbe in his parents” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n    Restoring the common-law doctrine of in loco parentis\nwould not, however, leave public schools entirely free to\nimpose any rule they choose. “If parents do not like the\nrules imposed by those schools, they can seek redress in\nschool boards or legislatures; they can send their children\nto private schools or home school them; or they can simply\nmove.” See Morse, 551 U.

No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v.\nEarls, 536 U. S. 822, 834 (2002). And yet the Court has\nlimited the authority of school officials to conduct searches\nfor the drugs that the officials believe pose a serious safety\nrisk to their students. By doing so, the majority has con\nfirmed that a return to the doctrine of in loco parentis is\n22     SAFFORD UNIFIED SCHOOL DIST. #1 v. REDDING\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nrequired to keep the judiciary from essentially seizing\ncontrol of public schools. Only then will teachers again be\nable to “ ‘govern the[ir] pupils, quicken the slothful, spur\nthe indolent, restrain the impetuous, and control the\nstubborn’ ” by making “ ‘rules, giv[ing] commands, and\npunish[ing] disobedience’ ” without interference from\njudges. See Morse, supra, at 414. By deciding that it is\nbetter equipped to decide what behavior should be permit\nted in schools, the Court has undercut student safety and\nundermined the authority of school administrators and\nlocal officials. Even more troubling, it has done so in a\ncase in which the underlying response by school adminis\ntrators was reasonable and justified. I cannot join this\nregrettable decision. I, therefore, respectfully dissent from\nthe Court’s determination that this search violated the\nFourth Amendment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145852/", "sha1": "ec57188a9d455f387b4e9a63f23de9faad2d90b0", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-079", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:34"}
