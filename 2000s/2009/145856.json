HOLDER, \n\n             ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL. \n\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE\n               DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n       No. 08\u2013322.      Argued April 29, 2009\u2014Decided June 22, 2009\nThe appellant is a small utility district with an elected board. Because\n  it is located in Texas, it is required by \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of\n  1965 (Act) to seek federal preclearance before it can change anything\n  about its elections, even though there is no evidence it has ever dis\n  criminated on the basis of race in those elections. The district filed\n  suit seeking relief under the \u201cbailout\u201d provision in \u00a74(a) of the Act,\n  which allows a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d to be released from the pre\n  clearance requirements if certain conditions are met. The district ar\n  gued in the alternative that, if \u00a75 were interpreted to render it ineli\n  gible for bailout, \u00a75 was unconstitutional. The Federal District Court\n  rejected both claims. It concluded that bailout under \u00a74(a) is avail\n  able only to counties, parishes, and subunits that register voters, not\n  to an entity like the district that does not register its own voters. It\n  also concluded that a 2006 amendment extending \u00a75 for 25 years was\n  constitutional.\nHeld:\n    1. The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are unde\n niable, but the Act now raises serious constitutional concerns. The\n preclearance requirement represents an intrusion into areas of state\n and local responsibility that is otherwise unfamiliar to our federal\n system. Some of the conditions that the Court relied upon in uphold\n ing this statutory scheme in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S.\n 301, and City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, have unques\n tionably improved. Those improvements are no doubt due in signifi\n cant part to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a monument to\n2           NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                     NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    its success, but the Act imposes current burdens and must be justi\n    fied by current needs. The Act also differentiates between the States\n    in ways that may no longer be justified.\n       At the same time, the Court recognizes that judging the constitu\n    tionality of an Act of Congress is \u201cthe gravest and most delicate duty\n    that this Court is called upon to perform.\u201d Blodgett v. Holden, 275\n    U. S. 142, 147\u2013148 (Holmes, J., concurring). Here the District Court\n    found that the sizable record compiled by Congress to support exten\n    sion of \u00a75 documented continuing racial discrimination and that \u00a75\n    deterred discriminatory changes.\n       The Court will not shrink from its duty \u201cas the bulwark of a limited\n    Constitution against legislative encroachments,\u201d The Federalist No.\n    78, but \u201c[i]t is . . . well established. . . that normally the Court will not\n    decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon\n    which to dispose of the case,\u201d Escambia County v. McMillan, 466\n    U. S. 48, 51. Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is\n    eligible to bail out under \u00a7\u00a74 and 5, and that claim is sufficient to re\n    solve the appeal. Pp. 6\u201311.\n       2. The Act must be interpreted to permit all political subdivisions,\n    including the district, to seek to bail out from the preclearance re\n    quirements. It is undisputed that the district is a \u201cpolitical subdivi\n    sion\u201d in the ordinary sense, but the Act also provides a narrower\n    definition in \u00a714(c)(2): \u201c \u2018[P]olitical subdivision\u2019 shall mean any county\n    or parish, except that where registration for voting is not conducted\n    under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall include\n    any other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for vot\n    ing.\u201d The court below concluded that the district did not qualify for\n    \u00a74(a) bailout under this definition, but specific precedent, the Act\u2019s\n    structure, and underlying constitutional concerns compel a broader\n    reading.\n       This Court has already established that \u00a714(c)(2)\u2019s definition does\n    not apply to the term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in \u00a75\u2019s preclearance pro\n    vision. See, e.g., United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 435 U. S.\n    110. Rather, the \u201cdefinition was intended to operate only for pur\n    poses of determining which political units in nondesignated States\n    may be separately designated for coverage under \u00a74(b).\u201d Id., at 128\u2013\n    129. \u201d[O]nce a State has been [so] designated . . . , [the] definition . . .\n    has no operative significance in determining [\u00a75\u2019s] reach.\u201d Dougherty\n    County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 44. In light of these deci\n    sions, \u00a714(c)(2)\u2019s definition should not constrict the availability of\n    bailout either.\n       The Government responds that any such argument is foreclosed by\n    City of Rome. In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated City\n    of Rome. Thus, City of Rome\u2019s logic is no longer applicable. The Gov\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  ernment\u2019s contention that the district is subject to \u00a75 under Sheffield\n  not because it is a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d but because it is a \u201cState\u201d is\n  counterintuitive and similarly untenable after the 1982 amendments.\n  The Government\u2019s contrary interpretation has helped to render the\n  bailout provision all but a nullity. Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions\u2014\n  out of the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisions\u2014have suc\n  cessfully bailed out of the Act. It is unlikely that Congress intended\n  the provision to have such limited effect. Pp. 11\u201317.\n573 F. Supp. 2d 221, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

ERIC H.\n\n     HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL. \n\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR\n             THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n                                 [June 22, 2009]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   The plaintiff in this case is a small utility district rais\ning a big question\u2014the constitutionality of \u00a75 of the Vot\ning Rights Act. The district has an elected board, and is\nrequired by \u00a75 to seek preclearance from federal authori\nties in Washington, D. C., before it can change anything\nabout those elections. This is required even though there\nhas never been any evidence of racial discrimination in\nvoting in the district.\n   The district filed suit seeking relief from these preclear\nance obligations under the \u201cbailout\u201d provision of the Voting\nRights Act. That provision allows the release of a \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision\u201d from the preclearance requirements if certain\nrigorous conditions are met. The court below denied relief,\nconcluding that bailout was unavailable to a political\nsubdivision like the utility district that did not register its\nown voters. The district appealed, arguing that the Act\nimposes no such limitation on bailout, and that if it does,\nthe preclearance requirements are unconstitutional.\n2       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  That constitutional question has attracted ardent briefs\nfrom dozens of interested parties, but the importance of\nthe question does not justify our rushing to decide it.\nQuite the contrary: Our usual practice is to avoid the\nunnecessary resolution of constitutional questions. We\nagree that the district is eligible under the Act to seek\nbailout. We therefore reverse, and do not reach the consti\ntutionality of \u00a75.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Fifteenth Amendment promises that the \u201cright of\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged . . . on account of race, color, or previous condi\ntion of servitude.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, \u00a71. In addition\nto that self-executing right, the Amendment also gives\nCongress the \u201cpower to enforce this article by appropriate\nlegislation.\u201d \u00a72. The first century of congressional en\nforcement of the Amendment, however, can only be re\ngarded as a failure. Early enforcement Acts were incon\nsistently applied and repealed with the rise of Jim Crow.\nSouth Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 310 (1966);\nA. Keyssar, The Right to Vote 105\u2013111 (2000). Another\nseries of enforcement statutes in the 1950s and 1960s\ndepended on individual lawsuits filed by the Department\nof Justice. But litigation is slow and expensive, and the\nStates were creative in \u201ccontriving new rules\u201d to continue\nviolating the Fifteenth Amendment \u201cin the face of adverse\nfederal court decrees.\u201d Katzenbach, supra, at 335; Riley v.\nKennedy, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2).\n   Congress responded with the Voting Rights Act. Section\n2 of the Act operates nationwide; as it exists today, that\nprovision forbids any \u201cstandard, practice, or procedure\u201d\nthat \u201cresults in a denial or abridgment of the right of any\ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a). Section 2 is not at issue in\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis case.\n   The remainder of the Act constitutes a \u201cscheme of strin\ngent remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination\nhas been most flagrant.\u201d Katzenbach, supra, at 315.\nRather than continuing to depend on case-by-case litiga\ntion, the Act directly pre-empted the most powerful tools\nof black disenfranchisement in the covered areas. All\nliteracy tests and similar voting qualifications were abol\nished by \u00a74 of the Act. Voting Rights Act of 1965, \u00a7\u00a74(a)\u2013\n(d), 79 Stat. 438\u2013439. Although such tests may have been\nfacially neutral, they were easily manipulated to keep\nblacks from voting. The Act also empowered federal exam\niners to override state determinations about who was\neligible to vote. \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 9, 13, id., at 439\u2013442, 444\u2013445.\n   These two remedies were bolstered by \u00a75, which sus\npended all changes in state election procedure until they\nwere submitted to and approved by a three-judge Federal\nDistrict Court in Washington, D. C., or the Attorney Gen\neral. Id., at 439, codified as amended at 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71973c(a). Such preclearance is granted only if the change\nneither \u201chas the purpose nor will have the effect of deny\ning or abridging the right to vote on account of race or\ncolor.\u201d Ibid. We have interpreted the requirements of \u00a75\nto apply not only to the ballot-access rights guaranteed by\n\u00a74, but to drawing district lines as well. Allen v. State Bd.\nof Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 564\u2013565 (1969).\n   To confine these remedies to areas of flagrant disenfran\nchisement, the Act applied them only to States that had\nused a forbidden test or device in November 1964, and had\nless than 50% voter registration or turnout in the 1964\nPresidential election. \u00a74(b), 79 Stat. 438. Congress recog\nnized that the coverage formula it had adopted \u201cmight\nbring within its sweep governmental units not guilty of\nany unlawful discriminatory voting practices.\u201d Briscoe v.\nBell, 432 U. S. 404, 411 (1977). It therefore \u201cafforded such\njurisdictions immediately available protection in the form\n4       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nof . . . [a] \u2018bailout\u2019 suit.\u201d Ibid.\n   To bail out under the current provision, a jurisdiction\nmust seek a declaratory judgment from a three-judge\nDistrict Court in Washington, D. C.            42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1), 1973c(a). It must show that for the previ\nous 10 years it has not used any forbidden voting test, has\nnot been subject to any valid objection under \u00a75, and has\nnot been found liable for other voting rights violations; it\nmust also show that it has \u201cengaged in constructive efforts\nto eliminate intimidation and harassment\u201d of voters, and\nsimilar measures. \u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)(A)\u2013(F). The Attorney\nGeneral can consent to entry of judgment in favor of bail\nout if the evidence warrants it, though other interested\nparties are allowed to intervene in the declaratory judg\nment action. \u00a71973b(a)(9). There are other restrictions:\nTo bail out, a covered jurisdiction must show that every\njurisdiction in its territory has complied with all of these\nrequirements. \u00a71973b(a)(3). The District Court also\nretains continuing jurisdiction over a successful bailout\nsuit for 10 years, and may reinstate coverage if any viola\ntion is found. \u00a71973b(a)(5).\n   As enacted, \u00a7\u00a74 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act were\ntemporary provisions. They were expected to be in effect\nfor only five years. \u00a74(a), 79 Stat. 438. We upheld the\ntemporary Voting Rights Act of 1965 as an appropriate\nexercise of congressional power in Katzenbach, explaining\nthat \u201c[t]he constitutional propriety of the Voting Rights\nAct of 1965 must be judged with reference to the historical\nexperience which it reflects.\u201d 383 U. S., at 308. We con\ncluded that the problems Congress faced when it passed\nthe Act were so dire that \u201cexceptional conditions [could]\njustify legislative measures not otherwise appropriate.\u201d\nId., at 334\u2013335 (citing Home Building & Loan Assn. v.\nBlaisdell, 290 U. S. 398 (1934), and Wilson v. New, 243\nU. S. 332 (1917)).\n   Congress reauthorized the Act in 1970 (for 5 years),\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

The coverage\nformula remained the same, based on the use of voting\neligibility tests and the rate of registration and turnout\namong all voters, but the pertinent dates for assessing\nthese criteria moved from 1964 to include 1968 and even\ntually 1972. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(b). We upheld each of\nthese reauthorizations against constitutional challenges,\nfinding that circumstances continued to justify the provi\nsions. Georgia v. United States, 411 U. S. 526 (1973); City\nof Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156 (1980); Lopez v.\nMonterey County, 525 U. S. 266 (1999). Most recently, in\n2006, Congress extended \u00a75 for yet another 25 years.\nFannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King\nVoting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act\nof 2006, 120 Stat. 577. The 2006 Act retained 1972 as the\nlast baseline year for triggering coverage under \u00a75. It is\nthat latest extension that is now before us.\n                               B\n   Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number\nOne was created in 1987 to deliver city services to resi\ndents of a portion of Travis County, Texas. It is governed\nby a board of five members, elected to staggered terms of\nfour years. The district does not register voters but is\nresponsible for its own elections; for administrative rea\nsons, those elections are run by Travis County. Because\nthe district is located in Texas, it is subject to the obliga\ntions of \u00a75, although there is no evidence that it has ever\ndiscriminated on the basis of race.\n   The district filed suit in the District Court for the Dis\ntrict of Columbia, seeking relief under the statute\u2019s bailout\nprovisions and arguing in the alternative that, if inter\npreted to render the district ineligible for bailout, \u00a75 was\nunconstitutional. The three-judge District Court rejected\nboth claims. Under the statute, only a \u201cState or political\nsubdivision\u201d is permitted to seek bailout, 42 U. S.

Dist. No. One v. Mu\nkasey, 573 F. Supp. 2d 221, 232 (2008). Turning to the\ndistrict\u2019s constitutional challenge, the court concluded that\nthe 25-year extension of \u00a75 was constitutional both be\ncause \u201cCongress . . . rationally concluded that extending\n[\u00a7]5 was necessary to protect minorities from continued\nracial discrimination in voting\u201d and because \u201cthe 2006\nAmendment qualifies as a congruent and proportional\nresponse to the continuing problem of racial discrimina\ntion in voting.\u201d Id., at 283.

S. 110, 117\u2013118 (1978).\n   Some of the conditions that we relied upon in upholding\nthis statutory scheme in Katzenbach and City of Rome\nhave unquestionably improved. Things have changed in\nthe South. Voter turnout and registration rates now\napproach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of\nfederal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold\noffice at unprecedented levels. See generally H. R. Rep.\nNo. 109\u2013478, at 12\u201318.\n   These improvements are no doubt due in significant\npart to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a monu\nment to its success. Past success alone, however, is not\nadequate justification to retain the preclearance require\nments. See Issacharoff, Is Section 5 of the Voting Rights\n8       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

It may be that these improvements are insuffi\ncient and that conditions continue to warrant preclearance\nunder the Act. But the Act imposes current burdens and\nmust be justified by current needs.\n   The Act also differentiates between the States, despite\nour historic tradition that all the States enjoy \u201cequal\nsovereignty.\u201d United States v. Louisiana, 363 U. S. 1, 16\n(1960) (citing Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 223\n(1845)); see also Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725\u2013726\n(1869). Distinctions can be justified in some cases. \u201cThe\ndoctrine of the equality of States . . . does not bar . . .\nremedies for local evils which have subsequently ap\npeared.\u201d     Katzenbach, supra, at 328\u2013329 (emphasis\nadded). But a departure from the fundamental principle\nof equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute\u2019s\ndisparate geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the\nproblem that it targets.\n   These federalism concerns are underscored by the ar\ngument that the preclearance requirements in one State\nwould be unconstitutional in another. See Georgia v.\nAshcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 491\u2013492 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cRace cannot be the predominant factor in\nredistricting under our decision in Miller v. Johnson, 515\nU.

Additional\nconstitutional concerns are raised in saying that this\ntension between \u00a7\u00a72 and 5 must persist in covered juris\ndictions and not elsewhere.\n   The evil that \u00a75 is meant to address may no longer be\nconcentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclear\nance. The statute\u2019s coverage formula is based on data that\nis now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable\nevidence that it fails to account for current political condi\ntions.

That\nquestion has been extensively briefed in this case, but we\nneed not resolve it.

Here, the district also raises a statu\ntory claim that it is eligible to bail out under \u00a7\u00a74 and 5.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS argues that the principle of constitu\ntional avoidance has no pertinence here.

The district\u2019s\ncounsel confirmed this at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 14 (\u201c[Question:] [D]o you acknowledge that if we find\nin your favor on the bailout point we need not reach the\nconstitutional point? [Answer:] I do acknowledge that\u201d).\nWe therefore turn to the district\u2019s statutory argument.\n                                III\n   Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act authorizes a bail\nout suit by a \u201cState or political subdivision.\u201d 42 U.

See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1197\n(8th ed. 2004) (\u201cA division of a state that exists primarily\nto discharge some function of local government\u201d). The\ndistrict was created under Texas law with \u201cpowers of\ngovernment\u201d relating to local utilities and natural re\nsources. Tex. Const., Art. XVI, \u00a759(b); Tex. Water Code\nAnn. \u00a754.011 (West 2002); see also Bennett v. Brown Cty.\nWater Improvement Dist. No. 1, 272 S.

S. C.\n\u00a71973l(c)(2). The District Court concluded that this defini\ntion applied to the bailout provision in \u00a74(a), and that the\ndistrict did not qualify, since it is not a county or parish\n12      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

But this is an unusual\ncase.\u201d Lawson v. Suwannee Fruit & S. S. Co., 336 U. S.\n198, 201 (1949); see also Farmers Reservoir & Irrigation Co.\nv. McComb, 337 U. S. 755, 764 (1949); Philko Aviation, Inc.\nv. Shacket, 462 U. S. 406, 412 (1983). Were the scope of\n\u00a74(a) considered in isolation from the rest of the statute and\nour prior cases, the District Court\u2019s approach might well be\ncorrect. But here specific precedent, the structure of the\nVoting Rights Act, and underlying constitutional concerns\ncompel a broader reading of the bailout provision.\n   Importantly, we do not write on a blank slate. Our\ndecisions have already established that the statutory\ndefinition in \u00a714(c)(2) does not apply to every use of the\nterm \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in the Act. We have, for ex\nample, concluded that the definition does not apply to the\npreclearance obligation of \u00a75. According to its text, \u00a75\napplies only \u201c[w]henever a [covered] State or political\nsubdivision\u201d enacts or administers a new voting practice.\nYet in Sheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 435 U. S. 110, we rejected\nthe argument by a Texas city that it was neither a State\nnor a political subdivision as defined in the Act, and there\nfore did not need to seek preclearance of a voting change.\nThe dissent agreed with the city, pointing out that the city\ndid not meet the statutory definition of \u201cpolitical subdivi\nsion\u201d and therefore could not be covered. Id., at 141\u2013144\n(opinion of STEVENS, J.). The majority, however, relying\non the purpose and structure of the Act, concluded that\nthe \u201cdefinition was intended to operate only for purposes\nof determining which political units in nondesignated\nStates may be separately designated for coverage under\n\u00a74(b).\u201d Id., at 128\u2013129; see also id., at 130, n. 18 (\u201cCon\ngress\u2019s exclusive objective in \u00a714(c)(2) was to limit the\njurisdictions which may be separately designated for\ncoverage under \u00a74(b)\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  We reaffirmed this restricted scope of the statutory\ndefinition the next Term in Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v.\nWhite, 439 U. S. 32 (1978). There, a school board argued\nthat because \u201cit d[id] not meet the definition\u201d of political\nsubdivision in \u00a714(c)(2), it \u201cd[id] not come within the pur\nview of \u00a75.\u201d Id., at 43, 44. We responded:\n       \u201cThis contention is squarely foreclosed by our deci\n    sion last Term in [Sheffield]. There, we expressly re\n    jected the suggestion that the city of Sheffield was be\n    yond the ambit of \u00a75 because it did not itself register\n    voters and hence was not a political subdivision as the\n    term is defined in \u00a714(c)(2) of the Act. . . . [O]nce a\n    State has been designated for coverage, \u00a714(c)(2)\u2019s\n    definition of political subdivision has no operative sig\n    nificance in determining the reach of \u00a75.\u201d Id., at 44\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   According to these decisions, then, the statutory defini\ntion of \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in \u00a714(c)(2) does not apply to\nevery use of the term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in the Act.\nEven the intervenors who oppose the district\u2019s bailout\nconcede, for example, that the definition should not apply\nto \u00a72, which bans racial discrimination in voting by \u201cany\nState or political subdivision,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a). See\nBrief for Intervenor-Appellee Texas State Conference of\nNAACP Branches et al. 17 (citing Smith v.

In light of our\nholdings that the statutory definition does not constrict\nthe scope of preclearance required by \u00a75, the district ar\n14       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

HOLDER \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngues, it only stands to reason that the definition should\nnot constrict the availability of bailout from those pre\nclearance requirements either.\n   The Government responds that any such argument is\nforeclosed by our interpretation of the statute in City of\nRome, 446 U. S. 156. There, it argues, we made clear that\nthe discussion of political subdivisions in Sheffield was\ndictum, and \u201cspecifically held that a \u2018city is not a \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision\u201d for purposes of \u00a74(a) bailout.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Fed\neral Appellee 14 (quoting City of Rome, supra, at 168).\n   Even if that is what City of Rome held, the premises of\nits statutory holding did not survive later changes in the\nlaw. In City of Rome we rejected the city\u2019s attempt to bail\nout from coverage under \u00a75, concluding that \u201cpolitical\nunits of a covered jurisdiction cannot independently bring\na \u00a74(a) bailout action.\u201d 446 U. S., at 167. We concluded\nthat the statute as then written authorized a bailout suit\nonly by a \u201cState\u201d subject to the coverage formula, or a\n\u201cpolitical subdivision with respect to which [coverage]\ndeterminations have been made as a separate unit,\u201d id., at\n164, n. 2 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a) (1976 ed.)); see\nalso 446 U. S., at 163\u2013169. Political subdivisions covered\nbecause they were part of a covered State, rather than\nbecause of separate coverage determinations, could not\nseparately bail out. As JUSTICE STEVENS put it, \u201c[t]he\npolitical subdivisions of a covered State\u201d were \u201cnot entitled\nto bail out in a piecemeal fashion.\u201d Id., at 192 (concurring\nopinion).\n   In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated City of\nRome and instead embraced \u201cpiecemeal\u201d bailout. As part\nof an overhaul of the bailout provision, Congress amended\nthe Voting Rights Act to expressly provide that bailout\nwas also available to \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d in a covered\nState, \u201cthough [coverage] determinations were not made\nwith respect to such subdivision as a separate unit.\u201d\nVoting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, 96 Stat. 131,\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncodified at 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a)(1) (emphasis added). In\nother words, Congress decided that a jurisdiction covered\nbecause it was within a covered State need not remain\ncovered for as long as the State did. If the subdivision met\nthe bailout requirements, it could bail out, even if the\nState could not. In light of these amendments, our logic\nfor denying bailout in City of Rome is no longer applicable\nto the Voting Rights Act\u2014if anything, that logic compels\nthe opposite conclusion.\n   Bailout and preclearance under \u00a75 are now governed by a\nprinciple of symmetry. \u201cGiven the Court\u2019s decision in Shef\nfield that all political units in a covered State are to be\ntreated for \u00a75 purposes as though they were \u2018political sub\ndivisions\u2019 of that State, it follows that they should also be\ntreated as such for purposes of \u00a74(a)\u2019s bailout provisions.\u201d\nCity of Rome, supra, at 192 (STEVENS, J., concurring).\n   The Government contends that this reading of Sheffield\nis mistaken, and that the district is subject to \u00a75 under our\ndecision in Sheffield not because it is a \u201cpolitical subdivi\nsion\u201d but because it is a \u201cState.\u201d That would mean it could\nbail out only if the whole State could bail out.\n   The assertion that the district is a State is at least\ncounterintuitive. We acknowledge, however, that there\nhas been much confusion over why Sheffield held the city\nin that case to be covered by the text of \u00a75. See City of\nRome, 446 U. S., at 168\u2013169; id., at 192 (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring); see also Uvalde Consol. Independent School\nDist. v. United States, 451 U.

If the district is considered the\nState, and therefore necessarily subject to preclearance so\nlong as Texas is covered, then the same must be true of all\nother subdivisions of the State, including counties. That\n16      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwould render even counties unable to seek bailout so long\nas their State was covered. But that is the very restriction\nthe 1982 amendments overturned. Nobody denies that\ncounties in a covered State can seek bailout, as several of\nthem have. See Voting Rights Act: Section 5 of the Act\u2014\nHistory, Scope, and Purpose: Hearing Before the Subcom\nmittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., 2599\u20132834 (2005) (de\ntailing bailouts). Because such piecemeal bailout is now\npermitted, it cannot be true that \u00a75 treats every govern\nmental unit as the State itself.\n   The Government\u2019s contrary interpretation has helped to\nrender the bailout provision all but a nullity. Since 1982,\nonly 17 jurisdictions\u2014out of the more than 12,000 covered\npolitical subdivisions\u2014have successfully bailed out of the\nAct.

See United States v. Hayes, 555 U.

ERIC H.\n\n    HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL. \n\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR\n             THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n                        [June 22, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in the judgment in part\nand dissenting in part.\n   This appeal presents two questions: first, whether ap\u00ad\npellant is entitled to bail out from coverage under the\nVoting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA); and second, whether the\npreclearance requirement of \u00a75 of the VRA is unconstitu\u00ad\ntional. Because the Court\u2019s statutory decision does not\nprovide appellant with full relief, I conclude that it is\ninappropriate to apply the constitutional avoidance doc\u00ad\ntrine in this case. I would therefore decide the constitu\u00ad\ntional issue presented and hold that \u00a75 exceeds Congress\u2019\npower to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment.\n                              I\n  The doctrine of constitutional avoidance factors heavily\nin the Court\u2019s conclusion that appellant is eligible for\nbailout as a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d under \u00a74(a) of the VRA.\nSee ante, at 11. Regardless of the Court\u2019s resolution of the\nstatutory question, I am in full agreement that this case\nraises serious questions concerning the constitutionality of\n\u00a75 of the VRA. But, unlike the Court, I do not believe that\nthe doctrine of constitutional avoidance is applicable here.\nThe ultimate relief sought in this case is not bailout eligi\u00ad\n2        NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST.\n                  NO. ONE v. HOLDER\n                  Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nbility\u2014it is bailout itself. See First Amended Complaint\nin No. 06\u20131384 (DDC), p. 8, Record, Doc. 83 (\u201cPlaintiff\nrequests the Court to declare that the district has met the\nbail-out requirements of \u00a74 of the [VRA] and that the\npreclearance requirements of \u00a75 . . . no longer apply to the\ndistrict; or, in the alternative, that \u00a75 of the Act as applied\nto the district is an unconstitutional overextension of\nCongress\u2019s enforcement power to remedy past violations of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment\u201d).\n   Eligibility for bailout turns on the statutory question\naddressed by the Court\u2014the proper definition of \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision\u201d in the bailout clauses of \u00a74(a) of the VRA.\nEntitlement to bailout, however, requires a covered \u201cpo\u00ad\nlitical subdivision\u201d to submit substantial evidence indicat\u00ad\ning that it is not engaging in \u201cdiscrimination in voting on\naccount of race,\u201d see 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a)(3). The Court\nproperly declines to give appellant bailout because appel\u00ad\nlant has not yet proved its compliance with the statutory\nrequirements for such relief. See \u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)\u2013(3). In\nfact, the record below shows that appellant\u2019s factual enti\u00ad\ntlement to bailout is a vigorously contested issue. See,\ne.g., NAACP\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in\nNo. 06\u20131384 (DDC), pp. 490\u2013492, Record, Doc. 100; Attor\u00ad\nney General\u2019s Statement of Uncontested Material Facts in\nNo. 06\u20131384 (DDC), \u00b6\u00b619, 59, Record, Doc. 98. Given its\nresolution of the statutory question, the Court has thus\ncorrectly remanded the case for resolution of appellant\u2019s\nfactual entitlement to bailout. See ante, at 16.\n   But because the Court is not in a position to award\nappellant bailout, adjudication of the constitutionality of\n\u00a75, in my view, cannot be avoided. \u201cTraditionally, the\navoidance canon was not a doctrine under which courts\nread statutes to avoid mere constitutional doubts. In\u00ad\nstead, it commanded courts, when faced with two plausible\nconstructions of a statute\u2014one constitutional and the\nother unconstitutional\u2014to choose the constitutional read\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 557 U.

To the extent that constitutional\navoidance is a worthwhile tool of statutory construction, it\nis because it allows a court to dispose of an entire case on\ngrounds that do not require the court to pass on a statute\u2019s\nconstitutionality. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288,\n347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Court will not\npass upon a constitutional question although properly\npresented by the record, if there is also some other ground\nupon which the case may be disposed of\u201d); see also, e.g.,\nMayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality League,\n415 U. S. 605, 629 (1974). The doctrine \u201cavoids decision of\nconstitutional questions where possible, and it permits one\nlawsuit, rather than two, to resolve the entire contro\u00ad\nversy.\u201d C. Wright, The Law of Federal Courts \u00a719, p. 104\n(4th ed. 1983). Absent a determination that appellant is\nnot just eligible for bailout, but is entitled to it, this case\nwill not have been entirely disposed of on a nonconstitu\u00ad\ntional ground. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\u201c[I]f the Court were\nto give us bailout . . . the Court might choose on its own\nnot to reach the constitutional issues because we would\nreceive relief\u201d). Invocation of the doctrine of constitutional\navoidance is therefore inappropriate in this case.\n   The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is also unavail\u00ad\nable here because an interpretation of \u00a74(a) that merely\nmakes more political subdivisions eligible for bailout does\nnot render \u00a75 constitutional and the Court notably does\nnot suggest otherwise. See Clark, supra, at 396 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting). Bailout eligibility is a distant prospect for\nmost covered jurisdictions. To obtain bailout a covered\njurisdiction must satisfy numerous objective criteria. It\nmust show that during the previous 10 years: (A) no \u201ctest\nor device has been used within such State or political\nsubdivision for the purpose or with the effect of denying or\nabridging the right to vote on account of race or color\u201d; (B)\n\u201cno final judgment of any court of the United States . . .\n4       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

The\njurisdiction also has the burden of presenting \u201cevidence of\nminority participation, including evidence of the levels of\nminority group registration and voting, changes in such\nlevels over time, and disparities between minority-group\nand non-minority-group participation.\u201d \u00a71973b(a)(2).\n  These extensive requirements may be difficult to satisfy,\nsee Brief for Georgia Governor Sonny Purdue as Amicus\nCuriae 20\u201326, but at least they are objective. The covered\njurisdiction seeking bailout must also meet subjective\ncriteria: it must \u201c(i) have eliminated voting procedures and\nmethods of election which inhibit or dilute equal access to\nthe electoral process; (ii) have engaged in constructive\nefforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of per\u00ad\nsons exercising rights protected [under the Act]; and (iii)\nhave engaged in other constructive efforts, such as ex\u00ad\npanded opportunity for convenient registration and voting\nfor every person of voting age and the appointment of\nminority persons as election officials throughout the juris\u00ad\ndiction and at all stages of the election and registration\nprocess.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)(F)(i)\u2013(iii).\n  As a result, a covered jurisdiction meeting each of the\nobjective conditions could nonetheless be denied bailout\nbecause it has not, in the subjective view of the United\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia, engaged\nin sufficiently \u201cconstructive efforts\u201d to expand voting\nopportunities, \u00a71973b(a)(1)(F)(iii).

As the\nCourt notes, only a handful \u201cof the more than 12,000\ncovered political subdivisions . . . have successfully bailed\nout of the Act.\u201d Ante, at 16;1 see Williamson, The 1982\nAmendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Statutory Analy\u00ad\nsis of the Revised Bailout Provisions, 62 Wash. U. L. Q. 1,\n42 (1984) (explaining that \u201cthe conditions for termination\nof coverage have been made so restrictive that bailout will\ncontinue to be impossible for most jurisdictions\u201d). Accord\u00ad\ningly, bailout eligibility does not eliminate the issue of \u00a75\u2019s\nconstitutionality.\n                             II\n  The Court quite properly alerts Congress that \u00a75 tests\nthe outer boundaries of its Fifteenth Amendment en\u00ad\nforcement authority and may not be constitutional. See\nante, at 7\u20139. And, although I respect the Court\u2019s careful\napproach to this weighty issue, I nevertheless believe it is\nnecessary to definitively resolve that important question.\nFor the reasons set forth below, I conclude that the lack of\ncurrent evidence of intentional discrimination with respect\nto voting renders \u00a75 unconstitutional. The provision can\nno longer be justified as an appropriate mechanism for\nenforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.\n                          A\n  \u201cThe government of the United States is one of dele\u00ad\ngated powers alone.

Henderson ed. 2007). Whatever the reason for this\nanomaly, it only underscores how little relationship there is between\nthe existence of bailout and the constitutionality of \u00a75.\n6       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

Thornton, 514 U. S. 779,\n848 (1995) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). In the specific area of\nvoting rights, this Court has consistently recognized that\nthe Constitution gives the States primary authority over\nthe structuring of electoral systems. See, e.g., White v.\nWeiser, 412 U. S. 783, 795 (1973); Burns v. Richardson,\n384 U. S. 73, 84\u201385 (1966). \u201cNo function is more essential\nto the separate and independent existence of the States\nand their governments than the power to determine\nwithin the limits of the Constitution the qualifications of\ntheir own voters for state, county, and municipal offices\nand the nature of their own machinery for filling local\npublic offices.\u201d Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112, 125\n(1970) (opinion of Black, J.).\n   State autonomy with respect to the machinery of self\u00ad\ngovernment defines the States as sovereign entities rather\nthan mere provincial outposts subject to every dictate of a\ncentral governing authority. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 10\n(\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re\u00ad\nserved to the States respectively, or to the people\u201d); see\nalso Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 713 (1999).

The Fifteenth Amendment thus ren\u00ad\nders unconstitutional any federal or state law that would\nlimit a citizen\u2019s access to the ballot on one of the three\nbases enumerated in the Amendment. See Mobile v.\nBolden, 446 U.

Nonetheless, because States still retain\nsovereign authority over their election systems, any meas\u00ad\nure enacted in furtherance of the Fifteenth Amendment\nmust be closely examined to ensure that its encroachment\non state authority in this area is limited to the appropriate\nenforcement of this ban on discrimination.\n   There is certainly no question that the VRA initially\n\u201cwas passed pursuant to Congress\u2019 authority under the\nFifteenth Amendment.\u201d Lopez v. Monterey County, 525\nU. S. 266, 282 (1999). For example, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4(a) seek to\nimplement the Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive com\u00ad\nmand by creating a private cause of action to enforce \u00a71 of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment, see \u00a71973(a), and by banning\ndiscriminatory tests and devices in covered jurisdictions,\nsee \u00a71973b(a); see also City of Lockhart v.

And only such a punitive measure [as \u00a75]\nhad any hope of forcing the South to let blacks vote\u201d (em\u00ad\nphasis in original)).\n   It was against this backdrop of \u201chistorical experience\u201d\nthat \u00a75 was first enacted and upheld against a constitu\u00ad\ntional challenge. See Katzenbach, supra, at 308. As the\nKatzenbach Court explained, \u00a75, which applied to those\nStates and political subdivisions that had employed dis\u00ad\ncriminatory tests and devices in the previous Presidential\nelection, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(b), directly targeted the\n\u201cinsidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated\nin certain parts of our country through unremitting and\ningenious defiance of the Constitution.\u201d 383 U.

According to the Court, it was\nappropriate to radically interfere with control over local\nelections only in those jurisdictions with a history of dis\u00ad\ncriminatory disenfranchisement as those were \u201cthe geo\u00ad\ngraphic areas where immediate action seemed necessary.\u201d\nId., at 328.

In reaching its decision,\nthe Court thus refused to simply accept Congress\u2019 repre\u00ad\nsentation that the extreme measure was necessary to\nenforce the Fifteenth Amendment; rather, it closely re\u00ad\nviewed the record compiled by Congress to ensure that \u00a75\nwas \u201c \u2018appropriate\u2019 \u201d antievasion legislation. See id., at\n308. In so doing, the Court highlighted evidence showing\nthat black voter registration rates ran approximately 50\npercentage points lower than white voter registration in\nseveral States. See id., at 313. It also noted that the\nregistration rate for blacks in Alabama \u201crose only from\n14.2% to 19.4% between 1958 and 1964; in Louisiana it\nbarely inched ahead from 31.7% to 31.8% between 1956\nand 1965; and in Mississippi it increased only from 4.4%\nto 6.4% between 1954 and 1964.\u201d Ibid. The Court further\nobserved that voter turnout levels in covered jurisdictions\nhad been at least 12% below the national average in the\n1964 Presidential election. See id., at 329\u2013330.\n  The statistical evidence confirmed Congress\u2019 judgment\nthat \u201cthe extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules\nof various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuating vot\u00ad\ning discrimination in the face of adverse federal court\ndecrees\u201d was working and could not be defeated through\ncase-by-case enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.\nId., at 335. This record also clearly supported Congress\u2019\npredictive judgment that such \u201cStates might try similar\nmaneuvers in the future in order to evade the remedies for\nvoting discrimination contained in the Act itself.\u201d Ibid.\nThese stark statistics\u2014in conjunction with the unrelent\u00ad\ning use of discriminatory tests and practices that denied\nblacks the right to vote\u2014constituted sufficient proof of\n\u201cactual voting discrimination\u201d to uphold the preclearance\nrequirement imposed by \u00a75 on the covered jurisdictions as\nan appropriate exercise of congressional power under the\nFifteenth Amendment.

First, \u00a75 prohibits more\nstate voting practices than those necessarily encompassed\nby the explicit prohibition on intentional discrimination\nfound in the text of the Fifteenth Amendment. The ex\u00ad\nplicit command of the Fifteenth Amendment is a prohibi\u00ad\ntion on state practices that in fact deny individuals the\nright to vote \u201con account of\u201d race, color, or previous servi\u00ad\ntude. In contrast, \u00a75 is the quintessential prophylaxis; it\n\u201cgoes beyond the prohibition of the Fifteenth Amendment\nby suspending all changes to state election law\u2014however\ninnocuous\u2014until they have been precleared by federal\nauthorities in Washington, D. C.\u201d Ante, at 7. The Court\nhas freely acknowledged that such legislation is preventa\u00ad\ntive, upholding it based on the view that the Reconstruc\u00ad\ntion Amendments give Congress the power \u201cboth to rem\u00ad\nedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder\nby prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct,\nincluding that which is not itself forbidden by the\nAmendment\u2019s text.\u201d Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528\nU. S. 62, 81 (2000) (emphasis added).\n   Second, because it sweeps more broadly than the sub\u00ad\nstantive command of the Fifteenth Amendment, \u00a75 pushes\nthe outer boundaries of Congress\u2019 Fifteenth Amendment\nenforcement authority. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S.\n900, 926 (1995) (detailing the \u201cfederalism costs exacted by\n\u00a75\u201d); Presley v. Etowah County Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 491,\n500\u2013501 (1992) (describing \u00a75 as \u201can extraordinary depar\u00ad\nture from the traditional course of relations between the\nStates and the Federal Government\u201d); City of Rome v.\nUnited States, 446 U. S. 156, 200 (1980) (Powell, J., dis\u00ad\n14      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                 Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\nsenting) (\u201cThe preclearance requirement both intrudes on\nthe prerogatives of state and local governments and\nabridges the voting rights of all citizens in States covered\nunder the Act\u201d); Lopez, 525 U. S., at 293 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cSection 5 is a unique requirement that exacts\nsignificant federalism costs\u201d); ante, at 7 (\u201c[Section] 5,\nwhich authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of\nstate and local policymaking, imposes substantial federal\u00ad\nism costs \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Indeed, \u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement is \u201cone of the\nmost extraordinary remedial provisions in an Act noted for\nits broad remedies. Even the Department of Justice has\ndescribed it as a \u2018substantial departure . . . from ordinary\nconcepts of our federal system\u2019; its encroachment on state\nsovereignty is significant and undeniable.\u201d United States\nv. Sheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 435 U. S. 110, 141 (1978)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted). This \u201cen\u00ad\ncroachment is especially troubling because it destroys\nlocal control of the means of self-government, one of the\ncentral values of our polity.\u201d City of Rome, supra, at 201\n(Powell, J., dissenting). More than 40 years after its\nenactment, this intrusion has become increasingly difficult\nto justify.\n   Third, to accommodate the tension between the consti\u00ad\ntutional imperatives of the Fifteenth and Tenth Amend\u00ad\nments\u2014a balance between allowing the Federal Govern\u00ad\nment to patrol state voting practices for discrimination\nand preserving the States\u2019 significant interest in self\u00ad\ndetermination\u2014the constitutionality of \u00a75 has always\ndepended on the proven existence of intentional discrimi\u00ad\nnation so extensive that elimination of it through case-by\u00ad\ncase enforcement would be impossible. See Katzenbach,\n383 U. S., at 308 (\u201cBefore enacting the measure, Congress\nexplored with great care the problem of racial discrimina\u00ad\ntion in voting\u201d); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 667\n(1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cCongress made a detailed\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Essential to our holdings in\n[South Carolina v.] Katzenbach and City of Rome was our\nconclusion that Congress was remedying the effects of\nprior intentional racial discrimination. In both cases, we\nrequired Congress to have some evidence that the jurisdic\u00ad\ntion burdened with preclearance obligations had actually\nengaged in such intentional discrimination.\u201d         Lopez,\nsupra, at 294\u2013295 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n   The Court has never deviated from this understanding.\nWe have explained that prophylactic legislation designed\nto enforce the Reconstruction Amendments must \u201cidentify\nconduct transgressing the . . . substantive provisions\u201d it\nseeks to enforce and be tailored \u201cto remedying or prevent\u00ad\ning such conduct.\u201d Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed.\nExpense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639\n(1999). Congress must establish a \u201chistory and pattern\u201d of\nconstitutional violations to establish the need for \u00a75 by\njustifying a remedy that pushes the limits of its constitu\u00ad\ntional authority. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v.\nGarrett, 531 U. S. 356, 368 (2001). As a result, for \u00a75 to\nwithstand renewed constitutional scrutiny, there must be\na demonstrated connection between the \u201cremedial meas\u00ad\nures\u201d chosen and the \u201cevil presented\u201d in the record made\nby Congress when it renewed the Act. City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U.

Covered jurisdictions are\nnot now engaged in a systematic campaign to deny black\n16      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                 Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\ncitizens access to the ballot through intimidation and\nviolence. And the days of \u201cgrandfather clauses, property\nqualifications, \u2018good character\u2019 tests, and the requirement\nthat registrants \u2018understand\u2019 or \u2018interpret\u2019 certain matter,\u201d\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 311, are gone. There is thus\ncurrently no concerted effort in these jurisdictions to\nengage in the \u201cunremitting and ingenious defiance of the\nConstitution,\u201d id., at 309, that served as the constitutional\nbasis for upholding the \u201cuncommon exercise of congres\u00ad\nsional power\u201d embodied in \u00a75, id., at 334.\n   The lack of sufficient evidence that the covered jurisdic\u00ad\ntions currently engage in the type of discrimination that\nunderlay the enactment of \u00a75 undermines any basis for\nretaining it. Punishment for long past sins is not a legiti\u00ad\nmate basis for imposing a forward-looking preventative\nmeasure that has already served its purpose. Those sup\u00ad\nporting \u00a75\u2019s reenactment argue that without it these\njurisdictions would return to the racially discriminatory\npractices of 30 and 40 years ago. But there is no evidence\nthat public officials stand ready, if given the chance, to\nagain engage in concerted acts of violence, terror, and\nsubterfuge in order to keep minorities from voting. With\u00ad\nout such evidence, the charge can only be premised on\noutdated assumptions about racial attitudes in the covered\njurisdictions. Admitting that a prophylactic law as broad\nas \u00a75 is no longer constitutionally justified based on cur\u00ad\nrent evidence of discrimination is not a sign of defeat. It is\nan acknowledgment of victory.\n   The current statistical evidence confirms that the emer\u00ad\ngency that prompted the enactment of \u00a75 has long since\npassed. By 2006, the voter registration rates for blacks in\nAlabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi had jumped to\n71.8%, 66.9%, and 72.2%, respectively. See App. to Brief\nfor Southeastern Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6a\u2013\n7a (hereinafter SLF Brief). Therefore, in contrast to the\nKatzenbach Court\u2019s finding that the \u201cregistration of vot\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ning-age whites ran roughly 50 percentage points or more\nahead of Negro registration\u201d in these States in 1964, see\n383 U. S., at 313, since that time this disparity has nearly\nvanished. In 2006, the disparity was only 3 percentage\npoints in Alabama, 8 percentage points in Louisiana, and\nin Mississippi, black voter registration actually exceeded\nwhite voter registration by 1.5 percentage points. See\nApp. to SLF Brief 6a\u20137a. In addition, blacks in these\nthree covered States also have higher registration num\u00ad\nbers than the registration rate for whites in noncovered\nstates. See E. Blum & L. Campbell, Assessment of Voting\nRights Progress in Jurisdictions Covered Under Section\nFive of the Voting Rights Act 3\u20136 (American Enterprise\nInstitute, 2006); see also S. Rep. No. 109\u2013295, p. 11 (2006)\n(noting that \u201cpresently in seven of the covered States,\nAfrican-Americans are registered at a rate higher than the\nnational average\u201d; in two more, black registration in the\n2004 election was \u201cidentical to the national average\u201d; and\nin \u201cCalifornia, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and\nTexas, black registration and turnout in the 2004 election\n. . . was higher than that for whites\u201d).\n    Indeed, when reenacting \u00a75 in 2006, Congress evidently\nunderstood that the emergency conditions which prompted\n\u00a75\u2019s original enactment no longer exist. See H. R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013478, p. 12 (2006) (\u201cThe record reveals that many of\nthe first generation barriers to minority voter registration\nand voter turnout that were in place prior to the VRA\nhave been eliminated\u201d). Instead of relying on the kind of\nevidence that the Katzenbach Court had found so persua\u00ad\nsive, Congress instead based reenactment on evidence of\nwhat it termed \u201csecond generation barriers constructed to\nprevent minority voters from fully participating in the\nelectoral process.\u201d \u00a72(b)(2), 120 Stat. 577. But such evi\u00ad\ndence is not probative of the type of purposeful discrimina\u00ad\ntion that prompted Congress to enact \u00a75 in 1965. For\nexample, Congress relied upon evidence of racially polar\u00ad\n18      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST.\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER\n                 Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nized voting within the covered jurisdictions. But racially\npolarized voting is not evidence of unconstitutional dis\u00ad\ncrimination, see Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, is not state action,\nsee James v. Bowman, 190 U. S. 127, 136 (1903), and is\nnot a problem unique to the South, see Katz, Aisenbrey,\nBaldwin, Cheuse, & Weisbrodt, Documenting Discrimina\u00ad\ntion in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of The\nVoting Rights Act Since 1982, 39 U. Mich. J. L. Reform\n643, 665 (2006). The other evidence relied on by Congress,\nsuch as \u00a75 enforcement actions, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4 lawsuits, and\nfederal examiner and observer coverage, also bears no\nresemblance to the record initially supporting \u00a75, and is\nplainly insufficient to sustain such an extraordinary rem\u00ad\nedy. See SLF Brief 18\u201335. In sum, evidence of \u201csecond\ngeneration barriers\u201d cannot compare to the prevalent and\npervasive voting discrimination of the 1960\u2019s.\n   This is not to say that voter discrimination is extinct.\nIndeed, the District Court singled out a handful of exam\u00ad\nples of allegedly discriminatory voting practices from the\nrecord made by Congress. See, e.g., Northwest Austin\nMunicipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Mukasey, 573 F. Supp. 2d.\n221, 252\u2013254, 256\u2013262 (DDC 2008). But the existence of\ndiscrete and isolated incidents of interference with the\nright to vote has never been sufficient justification for the\nimposition of \u00a75\u2019s extraordinary requirements. From its\ninception, the statute was promoted as a measure needed\nto neutralize a coordinated and unrelenting campaign to\ndeny an entire race access to the ballot. See City of\nBoerne, 521 U. S., at 526 (concluding that Katzenbach\nconfronted a \u201cwidespread and persisting deprivation of\nconstitutional rights resulting from this country\u2019s history\nof racial discrimination\u201d). Perfect compliance with the\nFifteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive command is not\nnow\u2014nor has it ever been\u2014the yardstick for determining\nwhether Congress has the power to employ broad prophy\u00ad\nlactic legislation to enforce that Amendment.

Argued April 29, 2009\u2014Decided June 22, 2009\nThe appellant is a small utility district with an elected board. Because\n  it is located in Texas, it is required by \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of\n  1965 (Act) to seek federal preclearance before it can change anything\n  about its elections, even though there is no evidence it has ever dis\n  criminated on the basis of race in those elections. The district filed\n  suit seeking relief under the \u201cbailout\u201d provision in \u00a74(a) of the Act,\n  which allows a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d to be released from the pre\n  clearance requirements if certain conditions are met. The district ar\n  gued in the alternative that, if \u00a75 were interpreted to render it ineli\n  gible for bailout, \u00a75 was unconstitutional. The Federal District Court\n  rejected both claims. It concluded that bailout under \u00a74(a) is avail\n  able only to counties, parishes, and subunits that register voters, not\n  to an entity like the district that does not register its own voters. It\n  also concluded that a 2006 amendment extending \u00a75 for 25 years was\n  constitutional.\nHeld:\n    1. The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are unde\n niable, but the Act now raises serious constitutional concerns. The\n preclearance requirement represents an intrusion into areas of state\n and local responsibility that is otherwise unfamiliar to our federal\n system. Some of the conditions that the Court relied upon in uphold\n ing this statutory scheme in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S.\n 301, and City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.

Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is\n    eligible to bail out under \u00a7\u00a74 and 5, and that claim is sufficient to re\n    solve the appeal. Pp. 6\u201311.\n       2. The Act must be interpreted to permit all political subdivisions,\n    including the district, to seek to bail out from the preclearance re\n    quirements. It is undisputed that the district is a \u201cpolitical subdivi\n    sion\u201d in the ordinary sense, but the Act also provides a narrower\n    definition in \u00a714(c)(2): \u201c \u2018[P]olitical subdivision\u2019 shall mean any county\n    or parish, except that where registration for voting is not conducted\n    under the supervision of a county or parish, the term shall include\n    any other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for vot\n    ing.\u201d The court below concluded that the district did not qualify for\n    \u00a74(a) bailout under this definition, but specific precedent, the Act\u2019s\n    structure, and underlying constitutional concerns compel a broader\n    reading.\n       This Court has already established that \u00a714(c)(2)\u2019s definition does\n    not apply to the term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in \u00a75\u2019s preclearance pro\n    vision. See, e.g., United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 435 U. S.\n    110. Rather, the \u201cdefinition was intended to operate only for pur\n    poses of determining which political units in nondesignated States\n    may be separately designated for coverage under \u00a74(b).\u201d Id., at 128\u2013\n    129. \u201d[O]nce a State has been [so] designated . . . , [the] definition . . .\n    has no operative significance in determining [\u00a75\u2019s] reach.\u201d Dougherty\n    County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 44. In light of these deci\n    sions, \u00a714(c)(2)\u2019s definition should not constrict the availability of\n    bailout either.\n       The Government responds that any such argument is foreclosed by\n    City of Rome. In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated City\n    of Rome. Thus, City of Rome\u2019s logic is no longer applicable. The Gov\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions\u2014\n  out of the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisions\u2014have suc\n  cessfully bailed out of the Act. It is unlikely that Congress intended\n  the provision to have such limited effect.

The district has an elected board, and is\nrequired by \u00a75 to seek preclearance from federal authori\nties in Washington, D. C., before it can change anything\nabout those elections. This is required even though there\nhas never been any evidence of racial discrimination in\nvoting in the district.\n   The district filed suit seeking relief from these preclear\nance obligations under the \u201cbailout\u201d provision of the Voting\nRights Act. That provision allows the release of a \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision\u201d from the preclearance requirements if certain\nrigorous conditions are met. The court below denied relief,\nconcluding that bailout was unavailable to a political\nsubdivision like the utility district that did not register its\nown voters. The district appealed, arguing that the Act\nimposes no such limitation on bailout, and that if it does,\nthe preclearance requirements are unconstitutional.\n2       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\n  That constitutional question has attracted ardent briefs\nfrom dozens of interested parties, but the importance of\nthe question does not justify our rushing to decide it.\nQuite the contrary: Our usual practice is to avoid the\nunnecessary resolution of constitutional questions. We\nagree that the district is eligible under the Act to seek\nbailout. We therefore reverse, and do not reach the consti\ntutionality of \u00a75.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The Fifteenth Amendment promises that the \u201cright of\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged . . . on account of race, color, or previous condi\ntion of servitude.\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, \u00a71. In addition\nto that self-executing right, the Amendment also gives\nCongress the \u201cpower to enforce this article by appropriate\nlegislation.\u201d \u00a72. The first century of congressional en\nforcement of the Amendment, however, can only be re\ngarded as a failure. Early enforcement Acts were incon\nsistently applied and repealed with the rise of Jim Crow.\nSouth Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 310 (1966);\nA. Keyssar, The Right to Vote 105\u2013111 (2000). Another\nseries of enforcement statutes in the 1950s and 1960s\ndepended on individual lawsuits filed by the Department\nof Justice. But litigation is slow and expensive, and the\nStates were creative in \u201ccontriving new rules\u201d to continue\nviolating the Fifteenth Amendment \u201cin the face of adverse\nfederal court decrees.\u201d Katzenbach, supra, at 335; Riley v.\nKennedy, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2).\n   Congress responded with the Voting Rights Act. Section\n2 of the Act operates nationwide; as it exists today, that\nprovision forbids any \u201cstandard, practice, or procedure\u201d\nthat \u201cresults in a denial or abridgment of the right of any\ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or\ncolor.\u201d 42 U.

All\nliteracy tests and similar voting qualifications were abol\nished by \u00a74 of the Act. Voting Rights Act of 1965, \u00a7\u00a74(a)\u2013\n(d), 79 Stat. 438\u2013439. Although such tests may have been\nfacially neutral, they were easily manipulated to keep\nblacks from voting. The Act also empowered federal exam\niners to override state determinations about who was\neligible to vote. \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 9, 13, id., at 439\u2013442, 444\u2013445.\n   These two remedies were bolstered by \u00a75, which sus\npended all changes in state election procedure until they\nwere submitted to and approved by a three-judge Federal\nDistrict Court in Washington, D. C., or the Attorney Gen\neral. Id., at 439, codified as amended at 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71973c(a). Such preclearance is granted only if the change\nneither \u201chas the purpose nor will have the effect of deny\ning or abridging the right to vote on account of race or\ncolor.\u201d Ibid. We have interpreted the requirements of \u00a75\nto apply not only to the ballot-access rights guaranteed by\n\u00a74, but to drawing district lines as well. Allen v. State Bd.\nof Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 564\u2013565 (1969).\n   To confine these remedies to areas of flagrant disenfran\nchisement, the Act applied them only to States that had\nused a forbidden test or device in November 1964, and had\nless than 50% voter registration or turnout in the 1964\nPresidential election. \u00a74(b), 79 Stat. 438.

[a] \u2018bailout\u2019 suit.\u201d Ibid.\n   To bail out under the current provision, a jurisdiction\nmust seek a declaratory judgment from a three-judge\nDistrict Court in Washington, D. C.            42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1), 1973c(a). It must show that for the previ\nous 10 years it has not used any forbidden voting test, has\nnot been subject to any valid objection under \u00a75, and has\nnot been found liable for other voting rights violations; it\nmust also show that it has \u201cengaged in constructive efforts\nto eliminate intimidation and harassment\u201d of voters, and\nsimilar measures. \u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)(A)\u2013(F). The Attorney\nGeneral can consent to entry of judgment in favor of bail\nout if the evidence warrants it, though other interested\nparties are allowed to intervene in the declaratory judg\nment action. \u00a71973b(a)(9). There are other restrictions:\nTo bail out, a covered jurisdiction must show that every\njurisdiction in its territory has complied with all of these\nrequirements. \u00a71973b(a)(3). The District Court also\nretains continuing jurisdiction over a successful bailout\nsuit for 10 years, and may reinstate coverage if any viola\ntion is found. \u00a71973b(a)(5).\n   As enacted, \u00a7\u00a74 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act were\ntemporary provisions. They were expected to be in effect\nfor only five years. \u00a74(a), 79 Stat. 438. We upheld the\ntemporary Voting Rights Act of 1965 as an appropriate\nexercise of congressional power in Katzenbach, explaining\nthat \u201c[t]he constitutional propriety of the Voting Rights\nAct of 1965 must be judged with reference to the historical\nexperience which it reflects.\u201d 383 U.

The coverage\nformula remained the same, based on the use of voting\neligibility tests and the rate of registration and turnout\namong all voters, but the pertinent dates for assessing\nthese criteria moved from 1964 to include 1968 and even\ntually 1972. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(b). We upheld each of\nthese reauthorizations against constitutional challenges,\nfinding that circumstances continued to justify the provi\nsions. Georgia v. United States, 411 U.

The 2006 Act retained 1972 as the\nlast baseline year for triggering coverage under \u00a75. It is\nthat latest extension that is now before us.\n                               B\n   Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number\nOne was created in 1987 to deliver city services to resi\ndents of a portion of Travis County, Texas. It is governed\nby a board of five members, elected to staggered terms of\nfour years. The district does not register voters but is\nresponsible for its own elections; for administrative rea\nsons, those elections are run by Travis County. Because\nthe district is located in Texas, it is subject to the obliga\ntions of \u00a75, although there is no evidence that it has ever\ndiscriminated on the basis of race.\n   The district filed suit in the District Court for the Dis\ntrict of Columbia, seeking relief under the statute\u2019s bailout\nprovisions and arguing in the alternative that, if inter\npreted to render the district ineligible for bailout, \u00a75 was\nunconstitutional. The three-judge District Court rejected\nboth claims. Under the statute, only a \u201cState or political\nsubdivision\u201d is permitted to seek bailout, 42 U. S.

Turning to the\ndistrict\u2019s constitutional challenge, the court concluded that\nthe 25-year extension of \u00a75 was constitutional both be\ncause \u201cCongress . . . rationally concluded that extending\n[\u00a7]5 was necessary to protect minorities from continued\nracial discrimination in voting\u201d and because \u201cthe 2006\nAmendment qualifies as a congruent and proportional\nresponse to the continuing problem of racial discrimina\ntion in voting.\u201d Id., at 283.

C. The preclear\nance requirement applies broadly, NAACP v. Hampton\nCounty Election Comm\u2019n, 470 U. S. 166, 175\u2013176 (1985),\nand in particular to every political subdivision in a covered\nState, no matter how small, United States v. Sheffield Bd.\nof Comm\u2019rs, 435 U. S. 110, 117\u2013118 (1978).\n   Some of the conditions that we relied upon in upholding\nthis statutory scheme in Katzenbach and City of Rome\nhave unquestionably improved. Things have changed in\nthe South. Voter turnout and registration rates now\napproach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of\nfederal decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold\noffice at unprecedented levels. See generally H. R. Rep.\nNo. 109\u2013478, at 12\u201318.\n   These improvements are no doubt due in significant\npart to the Voting Rights Act itself, and stand as a monu\nment to its success. Past success alone, however, is not\nadequate justification to retain the preclearance require\nments. See Issacharoff, Is Section 5 of the Voting Rights\n8       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

It may be that these improvements are insuffi\ncient and that conditions continue to warrant preclearance\nunder the Act. But the Act imposes current burdens and\nmust be justified by current needs.\n   The Act also differentiates between the States, despite\nour historic tradition that all the States enjoy \u201cequal\nsovereignty.\u201d United States v.

Distinctions can be justified in some cases. \u201cThe\ndoctrine of the equality of States . . . does not bar . . .\nremedies for local evils which have subsequently ap\npeared.\u201d     Katzenbach, supra, at 328\u2013329 (emphasis\nadded). But a departure from the fundamental principle\nof equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute\u2019s\ndisparate geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the\nproblem that it targets.\n   These federalism concerns are underscored by the ar\ngument that the preclearance requirements in one State\nwould be unconstitutional in another. See Georgia v.\nAshcroft, 539 U. S. 461, 491\u2013492 (2003) (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cRace cannot be the predominant factor in\nredistricting under our decision in Miller v. Johnson, 515\nU. S. 900 (1995). Yet considerations of race that would\ndoom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth Amend\nment or \u00a72 seem to be what save it under \u00a75\u201d). Additional\nconstitutional concerns are raised in saying that this\ntension between \u00a7\u00a72 and 5 must persist in covered juris\ndictions and not elsewhere.\n   The evil that \u00a75 is meant to address may no longer be\nconcentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclear\nance. The statute\u2019s coverage formula is based on data that\nis now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable\nevidence that it fails to account for current political condi\ntions.

The district\u2019s\ncounsel confirmed this at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 14 (\u201c[Question:] [D]o you acknowledge that if we find\nin your favor on the bailout point we need not reach the\nconstitutional point?

See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1197\n(8th ed. 2004) (\u201cA division of a state that exists primarily\nto discharge some function of local government\u201d). The\ndistrict was created under Texas law with \u201cpowers of\ngovernment\u201d relating to local utilities and natural re\nsources. Tex. Const., Art. XVI, \u00a759(b); Tex.

S. C.\n\u00a71973l(c)(2). The District Court concluded that this defini\ntion applied to the bailout provision in \u00a74(a), and that the\ndistrict did not qualify, since it is not a county or parish\n12      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

But this is an unusual\ncase.\u201d Lawson v. Suwannee Fruit & S. S. Co., 336 U. S.\n198, 201 (1949); see also Farmers Reservoir & Irrigation Co.\nv. McComb, 337 U. S. 755, 764 (1949); Philko Aviation, Inc.\nv. Shacket, 462 U. S. 406, 412 (1983). Were the scope of\n\u00a74(a) considered in isolation from the rest of the statute and\nour prior cases, the District Court\u2019s approach might well be\ncorrect. But here specific precedent, the structure of the\nVoting Rights Act, and underlying constitutional concerns\ncompel a broader reading of the bailout provision.\n   Importantly, we do not write on a blank slate. Our\ndecisions have already established that the statutory\ndefinition in \u00a714(c)(2) does not apply to every use of the\nterm \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in the Act. We have, for ex\nample, concluded that the definition does not apply to the\npreclearance obligation of \u00a75. According to its text, \u00a75\napplies only \u201c[w]henever a [covered] State or political\nsubdivision\u201d enacts or administers a new voting practice.\nYet in Sheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 435 U. S. 110, we rejected\nthe argument by a Texas city that it was neither a State\nnor a political subdivision as defined in the Act, and there\nfore did not need to seek preclearance of a voting change.\nThe dissent agreed with the city, pointing out that the city\ndid not meet the statutory definition of \u201cpolitical subdivi\nsion\u201d and therefore could not be covered. Id., at 141\u2013144\n(opinion of STEVENS, J.). The majority, however, relying\non the purpose and structure of the Act, concluded that\nthe \u201cdefinition was intended to operate only for purposes\nof determining which political units in nondesignated\nStates may be separately designated for coverage under\n\u00a74(b).\u201d Id., at 128\u2013129; see also id., at 130, n. 18 (\u201cCon\ngress\u2019s exclusive objective in \u00a714(c)(2) was to limit the\njurisdictions which may be separately designated for\ncoverage under \u00a74(b)\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  We reaffirmed this restricted scope of the statutory\ndefinition the next Term in Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v.\nWhite, 439 U. S. 32 (1978). There, a school board argued\nthat because \u201cit d[id] not meet the definition\u201d of political\nsubdivision in \u00a714(c)(2), it \u201cd[id] not come within the pur\nview of \u00a75.\u201d Id., at 43, 44. We responded:\n       \u201cThis contention is squarely foreclosed by our deci\n    sion last Term in [Sheffield]. There, we expressly re\n    jected the suggestion that the city of Sheffield was be\n    yond the ambit of \u00a75 because it did not itself register\n    voters and hence was not a political subdivision as the\n    term is defined in \u00a714(c)(2) of the Act. . . . [O]nce a\n    State has been designated for coverage, \u00a714(c)(2)\u2019s\n    definition of political subdivision has no operative sig\n    nificance in determining the reach of \u00a75.\u201d Id., at 44\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   According to these decisions, then, the statutory defini\ntion of \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in \u00a714(c)(2) does not apply to\nevery use of the term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d in the Act.\nEven the intervenors who oppose the district\u2019s bailout\nconcede, for example, that the definition should not apply\nto \u00a72, which bans racial discrimination in voting by \u201cany\nState or political subdivision,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a). See\nBrief for Intervenor-Appellee Texas State Conference of\nNAACP Branches et al. 17 (citing Smith v.

In light of our\nholdings that the statutory definition does not constrict\nthe scope of preclearance required by \u00a75, the district ar\n14       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

HOLDER \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngues, it only stands to reason that the definition should\nnot constrict the availability of bailout from those pre\nclearance requirements either.\n   The Government responds that any such argument is\nforeclosed by our interpretation of the statute in City of\nRome, 446 U. S. 156. There, it argues, we made clear that\nthe discussion of political subdivisions in Sheffield was\ndictum, and \u201cspecifically held that a \u2018city is not a \u201cpolitical\nsubdivision\u201d for purposes of \u00a74(a) bailout.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Fed\neral Appellee 14 (quoting City of Rome, supra, at 168).\n   Even if that is what City of Rome held, the premises of\nits statutory holding did not survive later changes in the\nlaw. In City of Rome we rejected the city\u2019s attempt to bail\nout from coverage under \u00a75, concluding that \u201cpolitical\nunits of a covered jurisdiction cannot independently bring\na \u00a74(a) bailout action.\u201d 446 U. S., at 167. We concluded\nthat the statute as then written authorized a bailout suit\nonly by a \u201cState\u201d subject to the coverage formula, or a\n\u201cpolitical subdivision with respect to which [coverage]\ndeterminations have been made as a separate unit,\u201d id., at\n164, n. 2 (quoting 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a) (1976 ed.)); see\nalso 446 U. S., at 163\u2013169. Political subdivisions covered\nbecause they were part of a covered State, rather than\nbecause of separate coverage determinations, could not\nseparately bail out. As JUSTICE STEVENS put it, \u201c[t]he\npolitical subdivisions of a covered State\u201d were \u201cnot entitled\nto bail out in a piecemeal fashion.\u201d Id., at 192 (concurring\nopinion).\n   In 1982, however, Congress expressly repudiated City of\nRome and instead embraced \u201cpiecemeal\u201d bailout. As part\nof an overhaul of the bailout provision, Congress amended\nthe Voting Rights Act to expressly provide that bailout\nwas also available to \u201cpolitical subdivisions\u201d in a covered\nState, \u201cthough [coverage] determinations were not made\nwith respect to such subdivision as a separate unit.\u201d\nVoting Rights Act Amendments of 1982, 96 Stat. 131,\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncodified at 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a)(1) (emphasis added). In\nother words, Congress decided that a jurisdiction covered\nbecause it was within a covered State need not remain\ncovered for as long as the State did. If the subdivision met\nthe bailout requirements, it could bail out, even if the\nState could not. In light of these amendments, our logic\nfor denying bailout in City of Rome is no longer applicable\nto the Voting Rights Act\u2014if anything, that logic compels\nthe opposite conclusion.\n   Bailout and preclearance under \u00a75 are now governed by a\nprinciple of symmetry. \u201cGiven the Court\u2019s decision in Shef\nfield that all political units in a covered State are to be\ntreated for \u00a75 purposes as though they were \u2018political sub\ndivisions\u2019 of that State, it follows that they should also be\ntreated as such for purposes of \u00a74(a)\u2019s bailout provisions.\u201d\nCity of Rome, supra, at 192 (STEVENS, J., concurring).\n   The Government contends that this reading of Sheffield\nis mistaken, and that the district is subject to \u00a75 under our\ndecision in Sheffield not because it is a \u201cpolitical subdivi\nsion\u201d but because it is a \u201cState.\u201d That would mean it could\nbail out only if the whole State could bail out.\n   The assertion that the district is a State is at least\ncounterintuitive. We acknowledge, however, that there\nhas been much confusion over why Sheffield held the city\nin that case to be covered by the text of \u00a75. See City of\nRome, 446 U. S., at 168\u2013169; id., at 192 (STEVENS, J.,\nconcurring); see also Uvalde Consol. Independent School\nDist. v. United States, 451 U. S. 1002, 1004, n. 4 (1981)\n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\u201c[T]his\nCourt has not yet settled on the proper construction of the\nterm \u2018political subdivision\u2019 \u201d).\n   But after the 1982 amendments, the Government\u2019s\nposition is untenable. If the district is considered the\nState, and therefore necessarily subject to preclearance so\nlong as Texas is covered, then the same must be true of all\nother subdivisions of the State, including counties. That\n16      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nwould render even counties unable to seek bailout so long\nas their State was covered. But that is the very restriction\nthe 1982 amendments overturned. Nobody denies that\ncounties in a covered State can seek bailout, as several of\nthem have. See Voting Rights Act: Section 5 of the Act\u2014\nHistory, Scope, and Purpose: Hearing Before the Subcom\nmittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the\nJudiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., 2599\u20132834 (2005) (de\ntailing bailouts). Because such piecemeal bailout is now\npermitted, it cannot be true that \u00a75 treats every govern\nmental unit as the State itself.\n   The Government\u2019s contrary interpretation has helped to\nrender the bailout provision all but a nullity. Since 1982,\nonly 17 jurisdictions\u2014out of the more than 12,000 covered\npolitical subdivisions\u2014have successfully bailed out of the\nAct.

See United States v. Hayes, 555 U.

Because the Court\u2019s statutory decision does not\nprovide appellant with full relief, I conclude that it is\ninappropriate to apply the constitutional avoidance doc\u00ad\ntrine in this case.

Regardless of the Court\u2019s resolution of the\nstatutory question, I am in full agreement that this case\nraises serious questions concerning the constitutionality of\n\u00a75 of the VRA.

See \u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)\u2013(3). In\nfact, the record below shows that appellant\u2019s factual enti\u00ad\ntlement to bailout is a vigorously contested issue.

To the extent that constitutional\navoidance is a worthwhile tool of statutory construction, it\nis because it allows a court to dispose of an entire case on\ngrounds that do not require the court to pass on a statute\u2019s\nconstitutionality. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288,\n347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Court will not\npass upon a constitutional question although properly\npresented by the record, if there is also some other ground\nupon which the case may be disposed of\u201d); see also, e.g.,\nMayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality League,\n415 U. S. 605, 629 (1974). The doctrine \u201cavoids decision of\nconstitutional questions where possible, and it permits one\nlawsuit, rather than two, to resolve the entire contro\u00ad\nversy.\u201d C. Wright, The Law of Federal Courts \u00a719, p. 104\n(4th ed. 1983). Absent a determination that appellant is\nnot just eligible for bailout, but is entitled to it, this case\nwill not have been entirely disposed of on a nonconstitu\u00ad\ntional ground. Cf. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\u201c[I]f the Court were\nto give us bailout . . . the Court might choose on its own\nnot to reach the constitutional issues because we would\nreceive relief\u201d). Invocation of the doctrine of constitutional\navoidance is therefore inappropriate in this case.\n   The doctrine of constitutional avoidance is also unavail\u00ad\nable here because an interpretation of \u00a74(a) that merely\nmakes more political subdivisions eligible for bailout does\nnot render \u00a75 constitutional and the Court notably does\nnot suggest otherwise. See Clark, supra, at 396 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting). Bailout eligibility is a distant prospect for\nmost covered jurisdictions. To obtain bailout a covered\njurisdiction must satisfy numerous objective criteria. It\nmust show that during the previous 10 years: (A) no \u201ctest\nor device has been used within such State or political\nsubdivision for the purpose or with the effect of denying or\nabridging the right to vote on account of race or color\u201d; (B)\n\u201cno final judgment of any court of the United States . . .\n4       NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL.

The\njurisdiction also has the burden of presenting \u201cevidence of\nminority participation, including evidence of the levels of\nminority group registration and voting, changes in such\nlevels over time, and disparities between minority-group\nand non-minority-group participation.\u201d \u00a71973b(a)(2).\n  These extensive requirements may be difficult to satisfy,\nsee Brief for Georgia Governor Sonny Purdue as Amicus\nCuriae 20\u201326, but at least they are objective. The covered\njurisdiction seeking bailout must also meet subjective\ncriteria: it must \u201c(i) have eliminated voting procedures and\nmethods of election which inhibit or dilute equal access to\nthe electoral process; (ii) have engaged in constructive\nefforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of per\u00ad\nsons exercising rights protected [under the Act]; and (iii)\nhave engaged in other constructive efforts, such as ex\u00ad\npanded opportunity for convenient registration and voting\nfor every person of voting age and the appointment of\nminority persons as election officials throughout the juris\u00ad\ndiction and at all stages of the election and registration\nprocess.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71973b(a)(1)(F)(i)\u2013(iii).\n  As a result, a covered jurisdiction meeting each of the\nobjective conditions could nonetheless be denied bailout\nbecause it has not, in the subjective view of the United\nStates District Court for the District of Columbia, engaged\nin sufficiently \u201cconstructive efforts\u201d to expand voting\nopportunities, \u00a71973b(a)(1)(F)(iii).

As the\nCourt notes, only a handful \u201cof the more than 12,000\ncovered political subdivisions . . . have successfully bailed\nout of the Act.\u201d Ante, at 16;1 see Williamson, The 1982\nAmendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Statutory Analy\u00ad\nsis of the Revised Bailout Provisions, 62 Wash. U. L. Q. 1,\n42 (1984) (explaining that \u201cthe conditions for termination\nof coverage have been made so restrictive that bailout will\ncontinue to be impossible for most jurisdictions\u201d). Accord\u00ad\ningly, bailout eligibility does not eliminate the issue of \u00a75\u2019s\nconstitutionality.\n                             II\n  The Court quite properly alerts Congress that \u00a75 tests\nthe outer boundaries of its Fifteenth Amendment en\u00ad\nforcement authority and may not be constitutional. See\nante, at 7\u20139. And, although I respect the Court\u2019s careful\napproach to this weighty issue, I nevertheless believe it is\nnecessary to definitively resolve that important question.\nFor the reasons set forth below, I conclude that the lack of\ncurrent evidence of intentional discrimination with respect\nto voting renders \u00a75 unconstitutional. The provision can\nno longer be justified as an appropriate mechanism for\nenforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.\n                          A\n  \u201cThe government of the United States is one of dele\u00ad\ngated powers alone.

The Fifteenth Amendment thus ren\u00ad\nders unconstitutional any federal or state law that would\nlimit a citizen\u2019s access to the ballot on one of the three\nbases enumerated in the Amendment. See Mobile v.\nBolden, 446 U.

Nonetheless, because States still retain\nsovereign authority over their election systems, any meas\u00ad\nure enacted in furtherance of the Fifteenth Amendment\nmust be closely examined to ensure that its encroachment\non state authority in this area is limited to the appropriate\nenforcement of this ban on discrimination.\n   There is certainly no question that the VRA initially\n\u201cwas passed pursuant to Congress\u2019 authority under the\nFifteenth Amendment.\u201d Lopez v.

For example, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4(a) seek to\nimplement the Fifteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive com\u00ad\nmand by creating a private cause of action to enforce \u00a71 of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment, see \u00a71973(a), and by banning\ndiscriminatory tests and devices in covered jurisdictions,\nsee \u00a71973b(a); see also City of Lockhart v.

First, \u00a75 prohibits more\nstate voting practices than those necessarily encompassed\nby the explicit prohibition on intentional discrimination\nfound in the text of the Fifteenth Amendment. The ex\u00ad\nplicit command of the Fifteenth Amendment is a prohibi\u00ad\ntion on state practices that in fact deny individuals the\nright to vote \u201con account of\u201d race, color, or previous servi\u00ad\ntude. In contrast, \u00a75 is the quintessential prophylaxis; it\n\u201cgoes beyond the prohibition of the Fifteenth Amendment\nby suspending all changes to state election law\u2014however\ninnocuous\u2014until they have been precleared by federal\nauthorities in Washington, D. C.\u201d Ante, at 7. The Court\nhas freely acknowledged that such legislation is preventa\u00ad\ntive, upholding it based on the view that the Reconstruc\u00ad\ntion Amendments give Congress the power \u201cboth to rem\u00ad\nedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder\nby prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct,\nincluding that which is not itself forbidden by the\nAmendment\u2019s text.\u201d Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528\nU. S. 62, 81 (2000) (emphasis added).\n   Second, because it sweeps more broadly than the sub\u00ad\nstantive command of the Fifteenth Amendment, \u00a75 pushes\nthe outer boundaries of Congress\u2019 Fifteenth Amendment\nenforcement authority. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S.\n900, 926 (1995) (detailing the \u201cfederalism costs exacted by\n\u00a75\u201d); Presley v. Etowah County Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 491,\n500\u2013501 (1992) (describing \u00a75 as \u201can extraordinary depar\u00ad\nture from the traditional course of relations between the\nStates and the Federal Government\u201d); City of Rome v.\nUnited States, 446 U. S. 156, 200 (1980) (Powell, J., dis\u00ad\n14      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                 Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\nsenting) (\u201cThe preclearance requirement both intrudes on\nthe prerogatives of state and local governments and\nabridges the voting rights of all citizens in States covered\nunder the Act\u201d); Lopez, 525 U. S., at 293 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cSection 5 is a unique requirement that exacts\nsignificant federalism costs\u201d); ante, at 7 (\u201c[Section] 5,\nwhich authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of\nstate and local policymaking, imposes substantial federal\u00ad\nism costs \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Indeed, \u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement is \u201cone of the\nmost extraordinary remedial provisions in an Act noted for\nits broad remedies. Even the Department of Justice has\ndescribed it as a \u2018substantial departure . . . from ordinary\nconcepts of our federal system\u2019; its encroachment on state\nsovereignty is significant and undeniable.\u201d United States\nv. Sheffield Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 435 U. S. 110, 141 (1978)\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted). This \u201cen\u00ad\ncroachment is especially troubling because it destroys\nlocal control of the means of self-government, one of the\ncentral values of our polity.\u201d City of Rome, supra, at 201\n(Powell, J., dissenting). More than 40 years after its\nenactment, this intrusion has become increasingly difficult\nto justify.\n   Third, to accommodate the tension between the consti\u00ad\ntutional imperatives of the Fifteenth and Tenth Amend\u00ad\nments\u2014a balance between allowing the Federal Govern\u00ad\nment to patrol state voting practices for discrimination\nand preserving the States\u2019 significant interest in self\u00ad\ndetermination\u2014the constitutionality of \u00a75 has always\ndepended on the proven existence of intentional discrimi\u00ad\nnation so extensive that elimination of it through case-by\u00ad\ncase enforcement would be impossible. See Katzenbach,\n383 U. S., at 308 (\u201cBefore enacting the measure, Congress\nexplored with great care the problem of racial discrimina\u00ad\ntion in voting\u201d); Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 667\n(1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cCongress made a detailed\n                 Cite as: 557 U.

Essential to our holdings in\n[South Carolina v.] Katzenbach and City of Rome was our\nconclusion that Congress was remedying the effects of\nprior intentional racial discrimination. In both cases, we\nrequired Congress to have some evidence that the jurisdic\u00ad\ntion burdened with preclearance obligations had actually\nengaged in such intentional discrimination.\u201d         Lopez,\nsupra, at 294\u2013295 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (emphasis in\noriginal).\n   The Court has never deviated from this understanding.\nWe have explained that prophylactic legislation designed\nto enforce the Reconstruction Amendments must \u201cidentify\nconduct transgressing the . . . substantive provisions\u201d it\nseeks to enforce and be tailored \u201cto remedying or prevent\u00ad\ning such conduct.\u201d Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed.\nExpense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639\n(1999). Congress must establish a \u201chistory and pattern\u201d of\nconstitutional violations to establish the need for \u00a75 by\njustifying a remedy that pushes the limits of its constitu\u00ad\ntional authority. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v.\nGarrett, 531 U. S. 356, 368 (2001). As a result, for \u00a75 to\nwithstand renewed constitutional scrutiny, there must be\na demonstrated connection between the \u201cremedial meas\u00ad\nures\u201d chosen and the \u201cevil presented\u201d in the record made\nby Congress when it renewed the Act. City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U. S. 507, 530 (1997). \u201cStrong measures ap\u00ad\npropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted\nresponse to another, lesser one.\u201d Ibid.\n                           C\n  The extensive pattern of discrimination that led the\nCourt to previously uphold \u00a75 as enforcing the Fifteenth\nAmendment no longer exists. Covered jurisdictions are\nnot now engaged in a systematic campaign to deny black\n16      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST. \n\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER \n\n                 Opinion of THOMAS, J. \n\n\ncitizens access to the ballot through intimidation and\nviolence. And the days of \u201cgrandfather clauses, property\nqualifications, \u2018good character\u2019 tests, and the requirement\nthat registrants \u2018understand\u2019 or \u2018interpret\u2019 certain matter,\u201d\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 311, are gone. There is thus\ncurrently no concerted effort in these jurisdictions to\nengage in the \u201cunremitting and ingenious defiance of the\nConstitution,\u201d id., at 309, that served as the constitutional\nbasis for upholding the \u201cuncommon exercise of congres\u00ad\nsional power\u201d embodied in \u00a75, id., at 334.\n   The lack of sufficient evidence that the covered jurisdic\u00ad\ntions currently engage in the type of discrimination that\nunderlay the enactment of \u00a75 undermines any basis for\nretaining it. Punishment for long past sins is not a legiti\u00ad\nmate basis for imposing a forward-looking preventative\nmeasure that has already served its purpose. Those sup\u00ad\nporting \u00a75\u2019s reenactment argue that without it these\njurisdictions would return to the racially discriminatory\npractices of 30 and 40 years ago. But there is no evidence\nthat public officials stand ready, if given the chance, to\nagain engage in concerted acts of violence, terror, and\nsubterfuge in order to keep minorities from voting. With\u00ad\nout such evidence, the charge can only be premised on\noutdated assumptions about racial attitudes in the covered\njurisdictions. Admitting that a prophylactic law as broad\nas \u00a75 is no longer constitutionally justified based on cur\u00ad\nrent evidence of discrimination is not a sign of defeat. It is\nan acknowledgment of victory.\n   The current statistical evidence confirms that the emer\u00ad\ngency that prompted the enactment of \u00a75 has long since\npassed. By 2006, the voter registration rates for blacks in\nAlabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi had jumped to\n71.8%, 66.9%, and 72.2%, respectively. See App. to Brief\nfor Southeastern Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6a\u2013\n7a (hereinafter SLF Brief). Therefore, in contrast to the\nKatzenbach Court\u2019s finding that the \u201cregistration of vot\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ning-age whites ran roughly 50 percentage points or more\nahead of Negro registration\u201d in these States in 1964, see\n383 U. S., at 313, since that time this disparity has nearly\nvanished. In 2006, the disparity was only 3 percentage\npoints in Alabama, 8 percentage points in Louisiana, and\nin Mississippi, black voter registration actually exceeded\nwhite voter registration by 1.5 percentage points. See\nApp. to SLF Brief 6a\u20137a. In addition, blacks in these\nthree covered States also have higher registration num\u00ad\nbers than the registration rate for whites in noncovered\nstates. See E. Blum & L. Campbell, Assessment of Voting\nRights Progress in Jurisdictions Covered Under Section\nFive of the Voting Rights Act 3\u20136 (American Enterprise\nInstitute, 2006); see also S. Rep. No. 109\u2013295, p. 11 (2006)\n(noting that \u201cpresently in seven of the covered States,\nAfrican-Americans are registered at a rate higher than the\nnational average\u201d; in two more, black registration in the\n2004 election was \u201cidentical to the national average\u201d; and\nin \u201cCalifornia, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and\nTexas, black registration and turnout in the 2004 election\n. . . was higher than that for whites\u201d).\n    Indeed, when reenacting \u00a75 in 2006, Congress evidently\nunderstood that the emergency conditions which prompted\n\u00a75\u2019s original enactment no longer exist. See H. R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013478, p. 12 (2006) (\u201cThe record reveals that many of\nthe first generation barriers to minority voter registration\nand voter turnout that were in place prior to the VRA\nhave been eliminated\u201d). Instead of relying on the kind of\nevidence that the Katzenbach Court had found so persua\u00ad\nsive, Congress instead based reenactment on evidence of\nwhat it termed \u201csecond generation barriers constructed to\nprevent minority voters from fully participating in the\nelectoral process.\u201d \u00a72(b)(2), 120 Stat. 577. But such evi\u00ad\ndence is not probative of the type of purposeful discrimina\u00ad\ntion that prompted Congress to enact \u00a75 in 1965. For\nexample, Congress relied upon evidence of racially polar\u00ad\n18      NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTIL. DIST.\n                 NO. ONE v. HOLDER\n                 Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nized voting within the covered jurisdictions. But racially\npolarized voting is not evidence of unconstitutional dis\u00ad\ncrimination, see Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, is not state action,\nsee James v. Bowman, 190 U. S. 127, 136 (1903), and is\nnot a problem unique to the South, see Katz, Aisenbrey,\nBaldwin, Cheuse, & Weisbrodt, Documenting Discrimina\u00ad\ntion in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of The\nVoting Rights Act Since 1982, 39 U. Mich. J. L. Reform\n643, 665 (2006). The other evidence relied on by Congress,\nsuch as \u00a75 enforcement actions, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4 lawsuits, and\nfederal examiner and observer coverage, also bears no\nresemblance to the record initially supporting \u00a75, and is\nplainly insufficient to sustain such an extraordinary rem\u00ad\nedy. See SLF Brief 18\u201335. In sum, evidence of \u201csecond\ngeneration barriers\u201d cannot compare to the prevalent and\npervasive voting discrimination of the 1960\u2019s.\n   This is not to say that voter discrimination is extinct.\nIndeed, the District Court singled out a handful of exam\u00ad\nples of allegedly discriminatory voting practices from the\nrecord made by Congress. See, e.g., Northwest Austin\nMunicipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Mukasey, 573 F. Supp. 2d.\n221, 252\u2013254, 256\u2013262 (DDC 2008). But the existence of\ndiscrete and isolated incidents of interference with the\nright to vote has never been sufficient justification for the\nimposition of \u00a75\u2019s extraordinary requirements. From its\ninception, the statute was promoted as a measure needed\nto neutralize a coordinated and unrelenting campaign to\ndeny an entire race access to the ballot. See City of\nBoerne, 521 U. S., at 526 (concluding that Katzenbach\nconfronted a \u201cwidespread and persisting deprivation of\nconstitutional rights resulting from this country\u2019s history\nof racial discrimination\u201d). Perfect compliance with the\nFifteenth Amendment\u2019s substantive command is not\nnow\u2014nor has it ever been\u2014the yardstick for determining\nwhether Congress has the power to employ broad prophy\u00ad\nlactic legislation to enforce that Amendment.

S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nremains with Congress to prove that the extreme circum\u00ad\nstances warranting \u00a75\u2019s enactment persist today. A record\nof scattered infringement of the right to vote is not a con\u00ad\nstitutionally acceptable substitute.\n                        *    *    *\n   In 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in order\nto guarantee that no citizen would be denied the right to\nvote based on race, color, or previous condition of servi\u00ad\ntude.

But\nnow\u2014more than 40 years later\u2013\u2013the violence, intimida\u00ad\ntion, and subterfuge that led Congress to pass \u00a75 and this\nCourt to uphold it no longer remains. An acknowledgment\nof \u00a75\u2019s unconstitutionality represents a fulfillment of the\nFifteenth Amendment\u2019s promise of full enfranchisement\nand honors the success achieved by the VRA.\n</pre>",
