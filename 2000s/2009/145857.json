(FBL), in 1971. As of 2001, Gross held the position of claims administration director. But in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to the position of claims project coordinator. At that same time, FBL transferred many of Gross' job responsibilities to a newly created position  claims administration manager. That position was given to Lisa Kneeskern, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2347</span> who had previously been supervised by Gross and who was then in her early forties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion). Although Gross (in his new position) and Kneeskern received the same compensation, Gross considered the reassignment a demotion because of FBL's reallocation of his former job responsibilities to Kneeskern.</p>\n<p>In April 2004, Gross filed suit in District Court, alleging that his reassignment to the position of claims project coordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee \"because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a). The case proceeded to trial, where Gross introduced evidence suggesting that his reassignment was based at least in part on his age. FBL defended its decision on the grounds that Gross' reassignment was part of a corporate restructuring and that Gross' new position was better suited to his skills. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion).</p>\n<p>At the close of trial, and over FBL's objections, the District Court instructed the jury that it must return a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that FBL \"demoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator\" and that his \"age was a motivating factor\" in FBL's decision to demote him. App. 9-10. The jury was further instructed that Gross' age would qualify as a \"`motivating factor,' if [it] played a part or a role in [FBL]'s decision to demote [him].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 10. The jury was also instructed regarding FBL's burden of proof. According to the District Court, the \"verdict must be for [FBL] ... if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that [FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him $46,945 in lost compensation. <i>Id.,</i> at 8.</p>\n<p>FBL challenged the jury instructions on appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard established in <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</i> 490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989). See 526 F.3d 356, 358 (2008). In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> this Court addressed the proper allocation of the burden of persuasion in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible considerations  <i>i.e.,</i> a \"mixed-motives\" case. 490 U.S., at 232, 244-247, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion). The <i>Price Waterhouse</i> decision was splintered. Four Justices joined a plurality opinion, see <i>id.,</i> at 231-258, 109 S.Ct. 1775, Justices White and O'Connor separately concurred in the judgment, see <i>id.,</i> at 258-261, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 261-279, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), and three Justices dissented, see <i>id.,</i> at 279-295, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Six Justices ultimately agreed that if a Title VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a \"motivating\" or a \"`substantial'\" factor in the employer's action, the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the same action regardless of that impermissible consideration. See <i>id.,</i> at 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 259-260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). Justice O'Connor further found that to shift the burden of persuasion to the employer, the employee must present \"direct evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment] decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2348</span> In accordance with Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals identified Justice O'Connor's opinion as controlling. See 526 F.3d, at 359 (citing <i>Erickson v. Farmland Industries, Inc.,</i> 271 F.3d 718, 724 (C.A.8 2001)). Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals found that Gross needed to present \"[d]irect evidence ... sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.\" 526 F.3d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Court of Appeals' view, \"direct evidence\" is only that evidence that \"show[s] a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Only upon a presentation of such evidence, the Court of Appeals held, should the burden shift to the employer \"`to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than not that the decision would have been the same absent consideration of the illegitimate factor.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Price Waterhouse, supra,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.)).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the District Court's jury instructions were flawed because they allowed the burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a preponderance of <i>any</i> category of evidence showing that age was a motivating factor  not just \"direct evidence\" related to FBL's alleged consideration of age. See 526 F.3d, at 360. Because Gross conceded that he had not presented direct evidence of discrimination, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should not have given the mixed-motives instruction. <i>Ibid.</i> Rather, Gross should have been held to the burden of persuasion applicable to typical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus should have been instructed only to determine whether Gross had carried his burden of \"prov[ing] that age was the determining factor in FBL's employment action.\" See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 555 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 680, 172 L.Ed.2d 649 (2008), and now vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The parties have asked us to decide whether a plaintiff must \"present direct evidence of discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction in a non-Title VII discrimination case.\" Pet. for Cert. i. Before reaching this question, however, we must first determine whether the burden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an alleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under the ADEA.<sup>[1]</sup> We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner relies on this Court's decisions construing Title VII for his interpretation of the ADEA. Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not control our construction of the ADEA.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2349</span> In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> a plurality of the Court and two Justices concurring in the judgment determined that once a \"plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that [the plaintiff's membership in a protected class] played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [that factor] into account.\" 490 U.S., at 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775; see also <i>id.,</i> at 259-260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). But as we explained in <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> 539 U.S. 90, 94-95, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003), Congress has since amended Title VII by explicitly authorizing discrimination claims in which an improper consideration was \"a motivating factor\" for an adverse employment decision. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m) (providing that \"an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was <i>a motivating factor</i> for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\" (emphasis added)); § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to plaintiffs proving violations of § 2000e-2(m)).</p>\n<p>This Court has never held that this burden-shifting framework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline to do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we \"must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.\" <i>Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 1147, 1153, 170 L.Ed.2d 10 (2008). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA's text does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title VII to add §§ 2000e-2(m) and 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways, see Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 115, 105 Stat. 1079; <i>id.,</i> § 302, at 1088.</p>\n<p>We cannot ignore Congress' decision to amend Title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally. See <i>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</i> 499 U.S. 244, 256, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991). Furthermore, as the Court has explained, \"negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\" when the provisions were \"considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\" <i>Lindh v. Murphy,</i> 521 U.S. 320, 330, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). As a result, the Court's interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as <i>Desert Palace</i> and <i>Price Waterhouse.</i><sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2350</span> B</h2>\n<p>Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the ADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does not. \"Statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\" <i>Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,</i> 541 U.S. 246, 252, 124 S.Ct. 1756, 158 L.Ed.2d 529 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ADEA provides, in relevant part, that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of</i> such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The words \"because of\" mean \"by reason of: on account of.\" 1 Webster's Third New International Dictionary 194 (1966); see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746 (1933) (defining \"because of\" to mean \"By reason <i>of,</i> on account <i>of</i>\" (italics in original)); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 132 (1966) (defining \"because\" to mean \"by reason; on account\"). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the ADEA's requirement that an employer took adverse action \"because of\" age is that age was the \"reason\" that the employer decided to act. See <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> 507 U.S. 604, 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993) (explaining that the claim \"cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in [the employer's decisionmaking] process <i>and had a determinative influence on the outcome</i>\" (emphasis added)). To establish a disparate-treatment claim under the plain language of the ADEA, therefore, a plaintiff must prove that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the employer's adverse decision. See <i>Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co.,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 2141-2142, 170 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2008) (recognizing that the phrase, \"by reason of,\" requires at least a showing of \"but for\" causation (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr,</i> 551 U.S. 47, 63-64, and n. 14, 127 S.Ct. 2201, 167 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2007) (observing that \"[i]n common talk, the phrase `based on' indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition\" and that the statutory phrase, \"based on,\" has the same meaning as the phrase, \"because of\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 265 (5th ed. 1984) (\"An act or omission is not regarded as a cause of an event if the particular event would have occurred without it\").<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2351</span> It follows, then, that under § 623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the employer's adverse action. Indeed, we have previously held that the burden is allocated in this manner in ADEA cases. See <i>Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___-___, ___-___, 128 S.Ct. 2361, 2363-2366, 2369-2371, 171 L.Ed.2d 322 (2008); <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 141, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). And nothing in the statute's text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases. Where the statutory text is \"silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,\" we \"begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.\" <i>Schaffer v. Weast,</i> 546 U.S. 49, 56, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005); see also <i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2395, 2400-2401, 171 L.Ed.2d 283 (2008) (\"Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, ... we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from the general rule in this setting.</p>\n<p>Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to establish employer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct or circumstantial), that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the challenged employer decision. See <i>Reeves, supra,</i> at 141-143, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reject petitioner's contention that our interpretation of the ADEA is controlled by <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> which initially established that the burden of persuasion shifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII claims.<sup>[5]</sup> In any event, it is far <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2352</span> from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today in the first instance. Cf. <i>14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1456, 1472, 173 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009) (declining to \"introduc[e] a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text\"); <i>Meacham, supra,</i> at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2406 (explaining that the ADEA must be \"read ... the way Congress wrote it\").</p>\n<p>Whatever the deficiencies of <i>Price Waterhouse</i> in retrospect, it has become evident in the years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply. For example, in cases tried to a jury, courts have found it particularly difficult to craft an instruction to explain its burden-shifting framework. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,</i> 958 F.2d 1176, 1179 (C.A.2 1992) (referring to \"the murky water of shifting burdens in discrimination cases\"); <i>Visser v. Packer Engineering Associates, Inc.,</i> 924 F.2d 655, 661 (C.A.7 1991) (en banc) (Flaum, J., dissenting) (\"The difficulty judges have in formulating [burden-shifting] instructions and jurors have in applying them can be seen in the fact that jury verdicts in ADEA cases are supplanted by judgments notwithstanding the verdict or reversed on appeal more frequently than jury verdicts generally\"). Thus, even if <i>Price Waterhouse</i> was doctrinally sound, the problems associated with its application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims. Cf. <i>Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.,</i> 433 U.S. 36, 47, 97 S.Ct. 2549, 53 L.Ed.2d 568 (1977) (reevaluating precedent that was subject to criticism and \"continuing controversy and confusion\"); <i>Payne v. Tennessee,</i> 501 U.S. 808, 839-844, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991) (SOUTER, J., concurring).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>We hold that a plaintiff bringing a disparate-treatment claim pursuant to the ADEA must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the challenged adverse employment action. The burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621 <i>et</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2353</span> seq., <i>makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee \"because of\" that individual's age, § 623(a). The most natural reading of this statutory text prohibits adverse employment actions motivated in whole or in part by the age of the employee. The \"but-for\" causation standard endorsed by the Court today was advanced in Justice KENNEDY's dissenting opinion in</i> Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, <i>490 U.S. 228, 279, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989),</i><i> a case construing identical language in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Not only did the Court reject the but-for standard in that case, but so too did Congress when it amended Title VII in 1991. Given this unambiguous history, it is particularly inappropriate for the Court, on its own initiative, to adopt an interpretation of the causation requirement in the ADEA that differs from the established reading of Title VII. I disagree not only with the Court's interpretation of the statute, but also with its decision to engage in unnecessary lawmaking. I would simply answer the question presented by the certiorari petition and hold that a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Court asks whether a mixed-motives instruction is ever appropriate in an ADEA case. As it acknowledges, this was not the question we granted certiorari to decide.<sup>[1]</sup> Instead, the question arose for the first time in respondent's brief, which asked us to \"overrule <i>Price Waterhouse</i> with respect to its application to the ADEA.\" Brief for Respondent 26 (boldface type deleted). In the usual course, this Court would not entertain such a request raised only in a merits brief: \"`We would normally expect notice of an intent to make so far-reaching an argument in the respondent's opposition to a petition for certiorari, cf. this Court's Rule 15.2, thereby assuring adequate preparation time for those likely affected and wishing to participate.'\" <i>Alabama v. Shelton,</i> 535 U.S. 654, 660, n. 3, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002) (quoting <i>South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama,</i> 526 U.S. 160, 171, 119 S.Ct. 1180, 143 L.Ed.2d 258 (1999)). Yet the Court is unconcerned that the question it chooses to answer has not been briefed by the parties or interested <i>amici curiae.</i> Its failure to consider the views of the United States, which represents the agency charged with administering the ADEA, is especially irresponsible.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the majority's inattention to prudential Court practices is matched by its utter disregard of our precedent and Congress' intent. The ADEA provides that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of</i> such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). As we recognized in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> when we construed the identical \"because of\" language of Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (making it unlawful for an employer \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual ... with respect to his compensation, terms, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2354</span> conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of</i> such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\" (emphasis added)), the most natural reading of the text proscribes adverse employment actions motivated in whole or in part by the age of the employee.</p>\n<p>In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> we concluded that the words \"`because of' such individual's... sex ... mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions.\" 490 U.S., at 240, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion); see also <i>id.,</i> at 260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (White, J., concurring in judgment). To establish a violation of Title VII, we therefore held, a plaintiff had to prove that her sex was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision.<sup>[3]</sup> We recognized that the employer had an affirmative defense: It could avoid a finding of liability by proving that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff's sex into account. <i>Id.,</i> at 244-245, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion). But this affirmative defense did not alter the meaning of \"because of.\" As we made clear, when \"an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision, that decision was `because of' sex.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 241, 109 S.Ct. 1775; see also <i>id.,</i> at 260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (White, J., concurring in judgment). We readily rejected the dissent's contrary assertion. \"To construe the words `because of' as colloquial shorthand for `but-for' causation,\" we said, \"is to misunderstand them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 240, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Today, however, the Court interprets the words \"because of\" in the ADEA \"as colloquial shorthand for `but-for' causation.\" <i>Ibid.</i> That the Court is construing the ADEA rather than Title VII does not justify this departure from precedent. The relevant language in the two statutes is identical, and we have long recognized that our interpretations of Title VII's language apply \"with equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA `were derived <i>in haec verba</i> from Title VII.'\" <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</i> 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (quoting <i>Lorillard v. Pons,</i> 434 U.S. 575, 584, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978)). See generally <i>Northcross v. Board of Ed. of Memphis City Schools,</i> 412 U.S. 427, 428, 93 S.Ct. 2201, 37 L.Ed.2d 48 (1973) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> For this reason, Justice KENNEDY's dissent in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> assumed the plurality's mixed-motives framework extended to the ADEA, see 490 U.S., at 292, 109 S.Ct. 1775, and the Courts of Appeals to have <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2355</span> considered the issue unanimously have applied <i>Price Waterhouse</i>to ADEA claims.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The Court nonetheless suggests that applying <i>Price Waterhouse</i> would be inconsistent with our ADEA precedents. In particular, the Court relies on our statement in <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> 507 U.S. 604, 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993), that \"[a disparate-treatment] claim `cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in [the employer's decisionmaking] process <i>and had a determinative influence on the outcome.</i>'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2350. The italicized phrase is at best inconclusive as to the meaning of the ADEA's \"because of\" language, however, as other passages in <i>Hazen Paper Co.</i> demonstrate. We also stated, for instance, that the ADEA \"requires the employer to <i>ignore</i> an employee's age,\" <i>id.,</i> at 612, 113 S.Ct. 1701 (emphasis added), and noted that \"[w]hen the employer's decision is <i>wholly motivated</i> by factors other than age,\" there is no violation, <i>id.,</i> at 611 (emphasis altered). So too, we indicated the \"possibility of dual liability under ERISA and the ADEA where the decision to fire the employee was motivated both by the employee's age and by his pension status,\" <i>id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701  a classic mixed-motives scenario.</p>\n<p>Moreover, both <i>Hazen Paper Co.</i> and <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), on which the majority also relies, support the conclusion that the ADEA should be interpreted consistently with Title VII. In those non-mixed-motives ADEA cases, the Court followed the standards set forth in non-mixed-motives Title VII cases including <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <i>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S., at 141-143, 120 S.Ct. 2097; <i>Hazen Paper Co.,</i> 507 U.S., at 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701. This by no means indicates, as the majority reasons, that <i>mixed-motives</i> ADEA cases should follow those standards. Rather, it underscores that ADEA standards are generally understood to conform to Title VII standards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The conclusion that \"because of\" an individual's age means that age was a motivating factor in an employment decision is bolstered by Congress' reaction to <i>Price Waterhouse</i> in the 1991 Civil Rights Act. As part of its response to \"a number of recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court that sharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness of [civil rights] laws,\" H.R.Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 2, p. 2 (1991), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1991, p. 694 (hereinafter H.R. Rep.), Congress eliminated the affirmative defense to liability that <i>Price Waterhouse</i> had furnished employers and provided instead that an employer's same-decision showing would limit only a plaintiff's remedies. See § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Importantly, however, Congress ratified <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s interpretation of the plaintiff's burden of proof, rejecting the dissent's suggestion in that case that but-for causation was the proper standard. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2356</span> § 2000e-2(m) (\"[A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\").</p>\n<p>Because the 1991 Act amended only Title VII and not the ADEA with respect to mixed-motives claims, the Court reasonably declines to apply the amended provisions to the ADEA.<sup>[6]</sup> But it proceeds to ignore the conclusion compelled by this interpretation of the Act: <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s construction of \"because of\" remains the governing law for ADEA claims.</p>\n<p>Our recent decision in <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S. 228, 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), is precisely on point, as we considered in that case the effect of Congress' failure to amend the disparate-impact provisions of the ADEA when it amended the corresponding Title VII provisions in the 1991 Act. Noting that \"the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII[but] did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination,\" we held that \"<i>Wards Cove</i>'s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII's identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.\" 544 U.S., at 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (discussing <i>Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</i> 490 U.S. 642, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989)); see also <i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2395, 2405-2406, 171 L.Ed.2d 283 (2008). If the <i>Wards Cove</i> disparate-impact framework that Congress flatly repudiated in the Title VII context continues to apply to ADEA claims, the mixed-motives framework that Congress substantially endorsed surely applies.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion, relying on Congress' partial ratification of <i>Price Waterhouse</i> to argue against that case's precedential value. It reasons that if the 1991 amendments do not apply to the ADEA, <i>Price Waterhouse</i> likewise must not apply because Congress effectively codified <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s holding in the amendments. <i>Ante,</i> at 2348-2349. This does not follow. To the contrary, the fact that Congress endorsed this Court's interpretation of the \"because of\" language in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> (even as it rejected the employer's affirmative defense to liability) provides all the more reason to adhere to that decision's motivating-factor test. Indeed, Congress emphasized in passing the 1991 Act that the motivating-factor test was consistent with its original intent in enacting Title VII. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R. Rep., pt. 2, at 17 (\"When enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress made clear that it intended to prohibit all invidious consideration of sex, race, color, religion, or national origin in employment decisions\"); <i>id.,</i> at 2 (stating that the Act \"reaffirm[ed] that any reliance on prejudice in making employment decisions is illegal\"); see also H.R. Rep., pt. 1, at 45; S.Rep. No. 101-315, pp. 6, 22 (1990).</p>\n<p>The 1991 amendments to Title VII also provide the answer to the majority's argument that the mixed-motives approach has proved unworkable. <i>Ante,</i> at 2351-2352. Because Congress has codified a mixed-motives <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2357</span> framework for Title VII cases  the vast majority of antidiscrimination lawsuits  the Court's concerns about that framework are of no moment. Were the Court truly worried about difficulties faced by trial courts and juries, moreover, it would not reach today's decision, which will further complicate every case in which a plaintiff raises both ADEA and Title VII claims.</p>\n<p>The Court's resurrection of the but-for causation standard is unwarranted. <i>Price Waterhouse</i> repudiated that standard 20 years ago, and Congress' response to our decision further militates against the crabbed interpretation the Court adopts today. The answer to the question the Court has elected to take up  whether a mixed-motives jury instruction is ever proper in an ADEA case  is plainly yes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although the Court declines to address the question we granted certiorari to decide, I would answer that question by following our unanimous opinion in <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> 539 U.S. 90, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003). I would accordingly hold that a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n<p>The source of the direct-evidence debate is Justice O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment in <i>Price Waterhouse.</i> Writing only for herself, Justice O'Connor argued that a plaintiff should be required to introduce \"direct evidence\" that her sex motivated the decision before the plurality's mixed-motives framework would apply. 490 U.S., at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775.<sup>[7]</sup> Many courts have treated Justice O'Connor's opinion in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> as controlling for both Title VII and ADEA mixed-motives cases in light of our statement in <i>Marks v. United States,</i> 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977), that \"[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, `the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.'\" Unlike the cases <i>Marks</i> addressed, however, <i>Price Waterhouse</i> garnered five votes for a single rationale: Justice White agreed with the plurality as to the motivating-factor test, see <i>supra,</i> at 2354, n. 3; he disagreed only as to the type of evidence an employer was required to submit to prove that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation. Taking the plurality to demand objective evidence, he wrote separately to express his view that an employer's credible testimony could suffice. 490 U.S., at 261, 109 S.Ct. 1775. Because Justice White provided a fifth vote for the \"rationale explaining the result\" of the <i>Price Waterhouse</i> decision, <i>Marks,</i> 430 U.S., at 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, his concurrence is properly understood as controlling, and he, like the plurality, did not require the introduction of direct evidence.</p>\n<p>Any questions raised by <i>Price Waterhouse</i> as to a direct evidence requirement were settled by this Court's unanimous decision in <i>Desert Palace,</i> in which we held that a plaintiff need not introduce direct evidence to meet her burden in a mixed-motives case under Title VII, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. In construing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2358</span> the language of § 2000e-2(m), we reasoned that the statute did not mention, much less require, a heightened showing through direct evidence and that \"Congress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements.\" 539 U.S., at 99, 123 S.Ct. 2148. The statute's silence with respect to direct evidence, we held, meant that \"we should not depart from the `[c]onventional rul[e] of civil litigation... [that] requires a plaintiff to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence', ... using `direct or circumstantial evidence.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S., at 253, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion), and <i>Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</i> 460 U.S. 711, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)). We also recognized the Court's consistent acknowledgment of the utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases.</p>\n<p>Our analysis in <i>Desert Palace</i> applies with equal force to the ADEA. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2351-2352, n. 4. As with the 1991 amendments to Title VII, no language in the ADEA imposes a heightened direct evidence requirement, and we have specifically recognized the utility of circumstantial evidence in ADEA cases. See <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S., at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (cited by <i>Desert Palace,</i> 539 U.S., at 99-100, 123 S.Ct. 2148). Moreover, in <i>Hazen Paper Co.,</i> we held that an award of liquidated damages for a \"willful\" violation of the ADEA did not require proof of the employer's motivation through direct evidence, 507 U.S., at 615, 113 S.Ct. 1701, and we have similarly rejected the imposition of special evidentiary rules in other ADEA cases. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); <i>O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.,</i> 517 U.S. 308, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996). <i>Desert Palace</i> thus confirms the answer provided by the plurality and Justice White in <i>Price Waterhouse:</i> An ADEA plaintiff need not present direct evidence of discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Court's endorsement of a different construction of the same critical language in the ADEA and Title VII is both unwise and inconsistent with settled law. The but-for standard the Court adopts was rejected by this Court in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> and by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Yet today the Court resurrects the standard in an unabashed display of judicial lawmaking. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice SOUTER and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice STEVENS that mixed-motive instructions are appropriate in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act context. And I join his opinion. The Court rejects this conclusion on the ground that the words \"because of\" require a plaintiff to prove that age was the \"but-for\" cause of his employer's adverse employment action. <i>Ante,</i> at 2350. But the majority does not explain why this is so. The words \"because of\" do not inherently require a showing of \"but-for\" causation, and I see no reason to read them to require such a showing.</p>\n<p>It is one thing to require a typical tort plaintiff to show \"but-for\" causation. In that context, reasonably objective scientific or commonsense theories of physical causation make the concept of \"but-for\" causation comparatively easy to understand and relatively easy to apply. But it is an entirely different matter to determine a \"but-for\" relation when we consider, not physical forces, but the mind-related characterizations that constitute motive. Sometimes we speak of <i>determining</i> or <i>discovering</i> motives, but more often we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2359</span> <i>ascribe</i> motives, after an event, to an individual in light of the individual's thoughts and other circumstances present at the time of decision. In a case where we characterize an employer's actions as having been taken out of multiple motives, say, both because the employee was old and because he wore loud clothing, to apply \"but-for\" causation is to engage in a hypothetical inquiry about what would have happened if the employer's thoughts and other circumstances had been different. The answer to this hypothetical inquiry will often be far from obvious, and, since the employee likely knows less than does the employer about what the employer was thinking at the time, the employer will often be in a stronger position than the employee to provide the answer.</p>\n<p>All that a plaintiff can know for certain in such a context is that the forbidden motive did play a role in the employer's decision. And the fact that a jury has found that age did play a role in the decision justifies the use of the word \"because,\" <i>i.e.,</i> the employer dismissed the employee because of his age (and other things). See <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</i> 490 U.S. 228, 239-242, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion). I therefore would see nothing wrong in concluding that the plaintiff has established a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p>But the law need not automatically assess liability in these circumstances. In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> the plurality recognized an affirmative defense where the defendant could show that the employee would have been dismissed regardless. The law permits the employer this defense, not because the forbidden motive, age, had no role in the <i>actual</i> decision, but because the employer can show that he would have dismissed the employee anyway in the <i>hypothetical</i> circumstance in which his age-related motive was absent. And it makes sense that this would be an affirmative defense, rather than part of the showing of a violation, precisely because the defendant is in a better position than the plaintiff to establish how he would have acted in this hypothetical situation. See <i>id.,</i> at 242, 109 S.Ct. 1775; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2356 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (describing the Title VII framework). I can see nothing unfair or impractical about allocating the burdens of proof in this way.</p>\n<p>The instruction that the District Court gave seems appropriate and lawful. It says, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Your verdict must be for plaintiff if all the following elements have been proved by the preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[The] plaintiff's age was a motivating factor in defendant's decision to demote plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"However, your verdict must be for defendant ... if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that defendant would have demoted plaintiff regardless of his age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"As used in these instructions, plaintiff's age was `a motivating factor,' if plaintiff's age played a part or a role in the defendant's decision to demote plaintiff. However, plaintiff's age need not have been the only reason for defendant's decision to demote plaintiff.\" App. 9-10.</blockquote>\n<p>For these reasons as well as for those set forth by Justice STEVENS, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although the parties did not specifically frame the question to include this threshold inquiry, \"[t]he statement of any question presented is deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein.\" This Court's Rule 14.1; see also <i>City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.,</i> 544 U.S. 197, 214, n. 8, 125 S.Ct. 1478, 161 L.Ed.2d 386 (2005) (\"`Questions not explicitly mentioned but essential to the analysis of the decisions below or to the correct disposition of the other issues have been treated as subsidiary issues fairly comprised by the question presented'\" (quoting R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, &amp; K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice 414 (8th ed.2002))); <i>Ballard v. Commissioner,</i> 544 U.S. 40, 46-47, and n. 2, 125 S.Ct. 1270, 161 L.Ed.2d 227 (2005) (evaluating \"a question anterior\" to the \"questions the parties raised\").</p>\n<p>[2]  Justice STEVENS argues that the Court must incorporate its past interpretations of Title VII into the ADEA because \"the substantive provisions of the ADEA were derived <i>in haec verba</i> from Title VII,\" <i>post,</i> at 2354 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), and because the Court has frequently applied its interpretations of Title VII to the ADEA, see <i>post,</i> at 2354-2356. But the Court's approach to interpreting the ADEA in light of Title VII has not been uniform. In <i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> 540 U.S. 581, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004), for example, the Court declined to interpret the phrase \"because of ... age\" in 29 U.S.C. § 623(a) to bar discrimination against people of all ages, even though the Court had previously interpreted \"because of... race [or] sex\" in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all races and both sexes, see 540 U.S., at 584, 592, n. 5, 124 S.Ct. 1236. And the Court has not definitively decided whether the evidentiary framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), utilized in Title VII cases is appropriate in the ADEA context. See <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <i>O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.,</i> 517 U.S. 308, 311, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996). In this instance, it is the textual differences between Title VII and the ADEA that prevent us from applying <i>Price Waterhouse</i> and <i>Desert Palace</i> to federal age discrimination claims.</p>\n<p>[3]  Justice BREYER contends that there is \"nothing unfair or impractical\" about hinging liability on whether \"forbidden motive ... play[ed] a role in the employer's decision.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2359 (dissenting opinion). But that is a decision for Congress to make. See <i>Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2326, 2338-2339, 171 L.Ed.2d 203 (2008). Congress amended Title VII to allow for employer liability when discrimination \"was <i>a motivating factor</i> for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m) (emphasis added), but did not similarly amend the ADEA, see <i>supra,</i> at 2348-2349. We must give effect to Congress' choice. See <i>14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1456, 1472, 173 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009).</p>\n<p>[4]  Because we hold that ADEA plaintiffs retain the burden of persuasion to prove all disparate-treatment claims, we do not need to address whether plaintiffs must present direct, rather than circumstantial, evidence to obtain a burden-shifting instruction. There is no heightened evidentiary requirement for ADEA plaintiffs to satisfy their burden of persuasion that age was the \"but-for\" cause of their employer's adverse action, see 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), and we will imply none. \"Congress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements\" in other statutory contexts, including in other subsections within Title 29, when it has seen fit. See <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> 539 U.S. 90, 99, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003); see also, <i>e.g.,</i> 25 U.S.C. § 2504(b)(2)(B) (imposing \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard); 29 U.S.C. § 722(a)(2)(A) (same).</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice STEVENS also contends that we must apply <i>Price Waterhouse</i> under the reasoning of <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> 544 U.S. 228, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005). See <i>post,</i> at 2356. In <i>Smith,</i> the Court applied to the ADEA its pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII with respect to disparate-impact claims despite Congress' 1991 amendment adding disparate-impact claims to Title VII but not the ADEA. 544 U.S., at 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536. But the amendments made by Congress in this same legislation, which added the \"motivating factor\" language to Title VII, undermine Justice STEVENS' argument. Congress not only explicitly added \"motivating factor\" liability to Title VII, see <i>supra,</i> at 2348-2349, but it also partially abrogated <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s holding by eliminating an employer's complete affirmative defense to \"motivating factor\" claims, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). If such \"motivating factor\" claims were already part of Title VII, the addition of § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) alone would have been sufficient. Congress' careful tailoring of the \"motivating factor\" claim in Title VII, as well as the absence of a provision parallel to § 2000e-2(m) in the ADEA, confirms that we cannot transfer the <i>Price Waterhouse</i> burden-shifting framework into the ADEA.</p>\n<p>[6]  Gross points out that the Court has also applied a burden-shifting framework to certain claims brought in contexts other than pursuant to Title VII. See Brief for Petitioner 54-55 (citing, <i>inter alia, </i><i>NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.,</i> 462 U.S. 393, 401-403, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983) (claims brought under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)); <i>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) (constitutional claims)). These cases, however, do not require the Court to adopt his contra statutory position. The case involving the NLRA did not require the Court to decide in the first instance whether burden shifting should apply as the Court instead deferred to the National Labor Relation Board's determination that such a framework was appropriate. See <i>NLRB, supra,</i> at 400-403, 103 S.Ct. 2469. And the constitutional cases such as <i>Mt. Healthy</i> have no bearing on the correct interpretation of ADEA claims, which are governed by statutory text.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"The question presented by the petitioner in this case is whether a plaintiff must present direct evidence of age discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motives jury instruction in a suit brought under the [ADEA].\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2346.</p>\n<p>[2]  The United States filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> brief supporting petitioner on the question presented. At oral argument, the Government urged that the Court should not reach the issue it takes up today. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21, 28-29.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although Justice White stated that the plaintiff had to show that her sex was a \"substantial\" factor, while the plurality used the term \"motivating\" factor, these standards are interchangeable, as evidenced by Justice White's quotation of <i>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977): \"`[T]he burden was properly placed upon [the plaintiff to show that the illegitimate criterion] was a \"substantial factor\"  or, <i>to put it in other words,</i> that it was a \"motivating factor\"'\" in the adverse decision. <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S., at 259, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (emphasis added); see also <i>id.,</i> at 249, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion) (using \"substantial\" and \"motivating\" interchangeably).</p>\n<p>[4]  We were no doubt aware that dictionaries define \"because of\" as \"by reason of\" or \"on account of.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2350. Contrary to the majority's bald assertion, however, this does not establish that the term denotes but-for causation. The dictionaries the Court cites do not, for instance, define \"because of\" as \"<i>solely</i> by reason of\" or \"<i>exclusively</i> on account of.\" In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> we recognized that the words \"because of\" do not mean \"<i>solely</i> because of,\" and we held that the inquiry \"commanded by the words\" of the statute was whether gender was a motivating factor in the employment decision. 490 U.S., at 241, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>[5]  See <i>Febres v.

Rep., pt. 2, at 4 (noting that a \"number of other laws banning discrimination, including ... the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621, et seq., are modeled after and have been interpreted in a manner consistent with Title VII,\" and that \"these other laws modeled after Title VII [should] be interpreted consistently in a manner consistent with Title VII as amended by this Act,\" including the mixed-motives provisions).</p>\n<p>[7]  While Justice O'Connor did not define precisely what she meant by \"direct evidence,\" we contrasted such evidence with circumstantial evidence in <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v.

(FBL), in 1971. As of 2001, Gross held the position of claims administration director. But in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to the position of claims project coordinator. At that same time, FBL transferred many of Gross' job responsibilities to a newly created position  claims administration manager. That position was given to Lisa Kneeskern, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2347</span> who had previously been supervised by Gross and who was then in her early forties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion). Although Gross (in his new position) and Kneeskern received the same compensation, Gross considered the reassignment a demotion because of FBL's reallocation of his former job responsibilities to Kneeskern.</p>\n<p>In April 2004, Gross filed suit in District Court, alleging that his reassignment to the position of claims project coordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee \"because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a). The case proceeded to trial, where Gross introduced evidence suggesting that his reassignment was based at least in part on his age. FBL defended its decision on the grounds that Gross' reassignment was part of a corporate restructuring and that Gross' new position was better suited to his skills. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion).</p>\n<p>At the close of trial, and over FBL's objections, the District Court instructed the jury that it must return a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that FBL \"demoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator\" and that his \"age was a motivating factor\" in FBL's decision to demote him. App. 9-10. The jury was further instructed that Gross' age would qualify as a \"`motivating factor,' if [it] played a part or a role in [FBL]'s decision to demote [him].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 10. The jury was also instructed regarding FBL's burden of proof. According to the District Court, the \"verdict must be for [FBL] ... if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that [FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him $46,945 in lost compensation. <i>Id.,</i> at 8.</p>\n<p>FBL challenged the jury instructions on appeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard established in <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989).

In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> this Court addressed the proper allocation of the burden of persuasion in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of both permissible and impermissible considerations  <i>i.e.,</i> a \"mixed-motives\" case. 490 U.S., at 232, 244-247, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion). The <i>Price Waterhouse</i> decision was splintered. Four Justices joined a plurality opinion, see <i>id.,</i> at 231-258, 109 S.Ct. 1775, Justices White and O'Connor separately concurred in the judgment, see <i>id.,</i> at 258-261, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 261-279, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), and three Justices dissented, see <i>id.,</i> at 279-295, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Six Justices ultimately agreed that if a Title VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a \"motivating\" or a \"`substantial'\" factor in the employer's action, the burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the same action regardless of that impermissible consideration. See <i>id.,</i> at 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 259-260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). Justice O'Connor further found that to shift the burden of persuasion to the employer, the employee must present \"direct evidence that an illegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment] decision.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2348</span> In accordance with Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals identified Justice O'Connor's opinion as controlling. See 526 F.3d, at 359 (citing <i>Erickson v. Farmland Industries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775579\"><a href=\"/opinion/775579/robert-e-erickson-v-farmland-industries-inc-a-miss/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span>, 724 (C.A.8 2001)). Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals found that Gross needed to present \"[d]irect evidence ... sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.\" 526 F.3d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Court of Appeals' view, \"direct evidence\" is only that evidence that \"show[s] a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted). Only upon a presentation of such evidence, the Court of Appeals held, should the burden shift to the employer \"`to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than not that the decision would have been the same absent consideration of the illegitimate factor.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Price Waterhouse, supra,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.)).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the District Court's jury instructions were flawed because they allowed the burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a preponderance of <i>any</i> category of evidence showing that age was a motivating factor  not just \"direct evidence\" related to FBL's alleged consideration of age. See 526 F.3d, at 360. Because Gross conceded that he had not presented direct evidence of discrimination, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court should not have given the mixed-motives instruction. <i>Ibid.</i> Rather, Gross should have been held to the burden of persuasion applicable to typical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus should have been instructed only to determine whether Gross had carried his burden of \"prov[ing] that age was the determining factor in FBL's employment action.\" See <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 555 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 680, 172 L.Ed.2d 649 (2008), and now vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The parties have asked us to decide whether a plaintiff must \"present direct evidence of discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction in a non-Title VII discrimination case.\" Pet. for Cert. i. Before reaching this question, however, we must first determine whether the burden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an alleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under the ADEA.<sup>[1]</sup> We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Petitioner relies on this Court's decisions construing Title VII for his interpretation of the ADEA. Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the relevant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not control our construction of the ADEA.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2349</span> In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> a plurality of the Court and two Justices concurring in the judgment determined that once a \"plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that [the plaintiff's membership in a protected class] played a motivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken [that factor] into account.\" 490 U.S., at 258, 109 S.Ct. 1775; see also <i>id.,</i> at 259-260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of White, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). But as we explained in <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 94-95, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003), Congress has since amended Title VII by explicitly authorizing discrimination claims in which an improper consideration was \"a motivating factor\" for an adverse employment decision. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m) (providing that \"an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was <i>a motivating factor</i> for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\" (emphasis added)); § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to plaintiffs proving violations of § 2000e-2(m)).</p>\n<p>This Court has never held that this burden-shifting framework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline to do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we \"must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.\" <i>Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki,</i> 552 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 1147, 1153, 170 L.Ed.2d 10 (2008). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA's text does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title VII to add §§ 2000e-2(m) and 2000e-5(g)(2)(B), even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways, see Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 115, 105 Stat. 1079; <i>id.,</i> § 302, at 1088.</p>\n<p>We cannot ignore Congress' decision to amend Title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the ADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally. See <i>EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112565\"><a href=\"/opinion/112565/eeoc-v-arabian-american-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 256, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991). Furthermore, as the Court has explained, \"negative implications raised by disparate provisions are strongest\" when the provisions were \"considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.\" <i>Lindh v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118135\"><a href=\"/opinion/118135/lindh-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span>, 330, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). As a result, the Court's interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as <i>Desert Palace</i> and <i>Price Waterhouse.</i><sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*2350</span> B</h2>\n<p>Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the ADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does not. \"Statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.\" <i>Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134734\"><a href=\"/opinion/134734/engine-mfrs-assn-v-south-coast-air-quality-managem/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></a></span>, 252, 124 S.Ct. 1756, 158 L.Ed.2d 529 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ADEA provides, in relevant part, that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of</i> such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The words \"because of\" mean \"by reason of: on account of.\" 1 Webster's Third New International Dictionary 194 (1966); see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746 (1933) (defining \"because of\" to mean \"By reason <i>of,</i> on account <i>of</i>\" (italics in original)); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 132 (1966) (defining \"because\" to mean \"by reason; on account\"). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the ADEA's requirement that an employer took adverse action \"because of\" age is that age was the \"reason\" that the employer decided to act. See <i>Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112844\"><a href=\"/opinion/112844/hazen-paper-co-v-biggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span>, 610, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993) (explaining that the claim \"cannot succeed unless the employee's protected trait actually played a role in [the employer's decisionmaking] process <i>and had a determinative influence on the outcome</i>\" (emphasis added)). To establish a disparate-treatment claim under the plain language of the ADEA, therefore, a plaintiff must prove that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the employer's adverse decision. See <i>Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co.,</i> 553 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 2141-2142, 170 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2008) (recognizing that the phrase, \"by reason of,\" requires at least a showing of \"but for\" causation (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Safeco Ins.

Burr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145725\"><a href=\"/opinion/145725/safeco-ins-co-of-america-v-burr/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 63-64, and n. 14, 127 S.Ct. 2201, 167 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2007) (observing that \"[i]n common talk, the phrase `based on' indicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a necessary logical condition\" and that the statutory phrase, \"based on,\" has the same meaning as the phrase, \"because of\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 265 (5th ed. 1984) (\"An act or omission is not regarded as a cause of an event if the particular event would have occurred without it\").<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*2351</span> It follows, then, that under § 623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the employer's adverse action. Indeed, we have previously held that the burden is allocated in this manner in ADEA cases. See <i>Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___-___, ___-___, 128 S.Ct. 2361, 2363-2366, 2369-2371, 171 L.Ed.2d 322 (2008); <i>Reeves v.

And nothing in the statute's text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases. Where the statutory text is \"silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,\" we \"begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.\" <i>Schaffer v. Weast,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1993216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1993216/schaffer-v-weast/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 56, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005); see also <i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2395, 2400-2401, 171 L.Ed.2d 283 (2008) (\"Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, ... we will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from the general rule in this setting.</p>\n<p>Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to establish employer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct or circumstantial), that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the challenged employer decision. See <i>Reeves, supra,</i> at 141-143, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Finally, we reject petitioner's contention that our interpretation of the ADEA is controlled by <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> which initially established that the burden of persuasion shifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII claims.<sup>[5]</sup> In any event, it is far <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2352</span> from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today in the first instance. Cf. <i>14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1456, 1472, 173 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009) (declining to \"introduc[e] a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text\"); <i>Meacham, supra,</i> at ___, 128 S.Ct., at 2406 (explaining that the ADEA must be \"read ... the way Congress wrote it\").</p>\n<p>Whatever the deficiencies of <i>Price Waterhouse</i> in retrospect, it has become evident in the years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult to apply. For example, in cases tried to a jury, courts have found it particularly difficult to craft an instruction to explain its burden-shifting framework. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Tyler v.

Thus, even if <i>Price Waterhouse</i> was doctrinally sound, the problems associated with its application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims.

The burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice SOUTER, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621 <i>et</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2353</span> seq., <i>makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any employee \"because of\" that individual's age, § 623(a).

Hopkins, <i><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 279, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989),</i><i> a case construing identical language in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Not only did the Court reject the but-for standard in that case, but so too did Congress when it amended Title VII in 1991. Given this unambiguous history, it is particularly inappropriate for the Court, on its own initiative, to adopt an interpretation of the causation requirement in the ADEA that differs from the established reading of Title VII. I disagree not only with the Court's interpretation of the statute, but also with its decision to engage in unnecessary lawmaking. I would simply answer the question presented by the certiorari petition and hold that a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Court asks whether a mixed-motives instruction is ever appropriate in an ADEA case. As it acknowledges, this was not the question we granted certiorari to decide.<sup>[1]</sup> Instead, the question arose for the first time in respondent's brief, which asked us to \"overrule <i>Price Waterhouse</i> with respect to its application to the ADEA.\" Brief for Respondent 26 (boldface type deleted). In the usual course, this Court would not entertain such a request raised only in a merits brief: \"`We would normally expect notice of an intent to make so far-reaching an argument in the respondent's opposition to a petition for certiorari, cf. this Court's Rule 15.2, thereby assuring adequate preparation time for those likely affected and wishing to participate.'\" <i>Alabama v.

Yet the Court is unconcerned that the question it chooses to answer has not been briefed by the parties or interested <i>amici curiae.</i> Its failure to consider the views of the United States, which represents the agency charged with administering the ADEA, is especially irresponsible.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the majority's inattention to prudential Court practices is matched by its utter disregard of our precedent and Congress' intent. The ADEA provides that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of</i> such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). As we recognized in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> when we construed the identical \"because of\" language of Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (making it unlawful for an employer \"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual ... with respect to his compensation, terms, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2354</span> conditions, or privileges of employment, <i>because of</i> such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\" (emphasis added)), the most natural reading of the text proscribes adverse employment actions motivated in whole or in part by the age of the employee.</p>\n<p>In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> we concluded that the words \"`because of' such individual's... sex ... mean that gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions.\" 490 U.S., at 240, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion); see also <i>id.,</i> at 260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (White, J., concurring in judgment). To establish a violation of Title VII, we therefore held, a plaintiff had to prove that her sex was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision.<sup>[3]</sup> We recognized that the employer had an affirmative defense: It could avoid a finding of liability by proving that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the plaintiff's sex into account. <i>Id.,</i> at 244-245, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion). But this affirmative defense did not alter the meaning of \"because of.\" As we made clear, when \"an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision, that decision was `because of' sex.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 241, 109 S.Ct. 1775; see also <i>id.,</i> at 260, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (White, J., concurring in judgment). We readily rejected the dissent's contrary assertion. \"To construe the words `because of' as colloquial shorthand for `but-for' causation,\" we said, \"is to misunderstand them.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 240, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>Today, however, the Court interprets the words \"because of\" in the ADEA \"as colloquial shorthand for `but-for' causation.\" <i>Ibid.</i> That the Court is construing the ADEA rather than Title VII does not justify this departure from precedent. The relevant language in the two statutes is identical, and we have long recognized that our interpretations of Title VII's language apply \"with equal force in the context of age discrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA `were derived <i>in haec verba</i> from Title VII.'\" <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.

The italicized phrase is at best inconclusive as to the meaning of the ADEA's \"because of\" language, however, as other passages in <i>Hazen Paper Co.</i> demonstrate. We also stated, for instance, that the ADEA \"requires the employer to <i>ignore</i> an employee's age,\" <i>id.,</i> at 612, 113 S.Ct. 1701 (emphasis added), and noted that \"[w]hen the employer's decision is <i>wholly motivated</i> by factors other than age,\" there is no violation, <i>id.,</i> at 611 (emphasis altered). So too, we indicated the \"possibility of dual liability under ERISA and the ADEA where the decision to fire the employee was motivated both by the employee's age and by his pension status,\" <i>id.,</i> at 613, 113 S.Ct. 1701  a classic mixed-motives scenario.</p>\n<p>Moreover, both <i>Hazen Paper Co.</i> and <i>Reeves v.

In those non-mixed-motives ADEA cases, the Court followed the standards set forth in non-mixed-motives Title VII cases including <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <i>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.

This by no means indicates, as the majority reasons, that <i>mixed-motives</i> ADEA cases should follow those standards. Rather, it underscores that ADEA standards are generally understood to conform to Title VII standards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The conclusion that \"because of\" an individual's age means that age was a motivating factor in an employment decision is bolstered by Congress' reaction to <i>Price Waterhouse</i> in the 1991 Civil Rights Act. As part of its response to \"a number of recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court that sharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness of [civil rights] laws,\" H.R.Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 2, p. 2 (1991), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1991, p. 694 (hereinafter H.R. Rep.), Congress eliminated the affirmative defense to liability that <i>Price Waterhouse</i> had furnished employers and provided instead that an employer's same-decision showing would limit only a plaintiff's remedies. See § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). Importantly, however, Congress ratified <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s interpretation of the plaintiff's burden of proof, rejecting the dissent's suggestion in that case that but-for causation was the proper standard. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2356</span> § 2000e-2(m) (\"[A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice\").</p>\n<p>Because the 1991 Act amended only Title VII and not the ADEA with respect to mixed-motives claims, the Court reasonably declines to apply the amended provisions to the ADEA.<sup>[6]</sup> But it proceeds to ignore the conclusion compelled by this interpretation of the Act: <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s construction of \"because of\" remains the governing law for ADEA claims.</p>\n<p>Our recent decision in <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005), is precisely on point, as we considered in that case the effect of Congress' failure to amend the disparate-impact provisions of the ADEA when it amended the corresponding Title VII provisions in the 1991 Act. Noting that \"the relevant 1991 amendments expanded the coverage of Title VII[but] did not amend the ADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination,\" we held that \"<i>Wards Cove</i>'s pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII's identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.\" 544 U.S., at 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536 (discussing <i>Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112270\"><a href=\"/opinion/112270/wards-cove-packing-co-v-atonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989)); see also <i>Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2395, 2405-2406, 171 L.Ed.2d 283 (2008). If the <i>Wards Cove</i> disparate-impact framework that Congress flatly repudiated in the Title VII context continues to apply to ADEA claims, the mixed-motives framework that Congress substantially endorsed surely applies.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion, relying on Congress' partial ratification of <i>Price Waterhouse</i> to argue against that case's precedential value. It reasons that if the 1991 amendments do not apply to the ADEA, <i>Price Waterhouse</i> likewise must not apply because Congress effectively codified <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s holding in the amendments. <i>Ante,</i> at 2348-2349. This does not follow. To the contrary, the fact that Congress endorsed this Court's interpretation of the \"because of\" language in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> (even as it rejected the employer's affirmative defense to liability) provides all the more reason to adhere to that decision's motivating-factor test. Indeed, Congress emphasized in passing the 1991 Act that the motivating-factor test was consistent with its original intent in enacting Title VII. See, <i>e.g.,</i> H.R. Rep., pt. 2, at 17 (\"When enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress made clear that it intended to prohibit all invidious consideration of sex, race, color, religion, or national origin in employment decisions\"); <i>id.,</i> at 2 (stating that the Act \"reaffirm[ed] that any reliance on prejudice in making employment decisions is illegal\"); see also H.R. Rep., pt. 1, at 45; S.Rep. No. 101-315, pp. 6, 22 (1990).</p>\n<p>The 1991 amendments to Title VII also provide the answer to the majority's argument that the mixed-motives approach has proved unworkable. <i>Ante,</i> at 2351-2352. Because Congress has codified a mixed-motives <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2357</span> framework for Title VII cases  the vast majority of antidiscrimination lawsuits  the Court's concerns about that framework are of no moment. Were the Court truly worried about difficulties faced by trial courts and juries, moreover, it would not reach today's decision, which will further complicate every case in which a plaintiff raises both ADEA and Title VII claims.</p>\n<p>The Court's resurrection of the but-for causation standard is unwarranted. <i>Price Waterhouse</i> repudiated that standard 20 years ago, and Congress' response to our decision further militates against the crabbed interpretation the Court adopts today. The answer to the question the Court has elected to take up  whether a mixed-motives jury instruction is ever proper in an ADEA case  is plainly yes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Although the Court declines to address the question we granted certiorari to decide, I would answer that question by following our unanimous opinion in <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003). I would accordingly hold that a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n<p>The source of the direct-evidence debate is Justice O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment in <i>Price Waterhouse.</i> Writing only for herself, Justice O'Connor argued that a plaintiff should be required to introduce \"direct evidence\" that her sex motivated the decision before the plurality's mixed-motives framework would apply. 490 U.S., at 276, 109 S.Ct. 1775.<sup>[7]</sup> Many courts have treated Justice O'Connor's opinion in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> as controlling for both Title VII and ADEA mixed-motives cases in light of our statement in <i>Marks v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977), that \"[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, `the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.'\" Unlike the cases <i>Marks</i> addressed, however, <i>Price Waterhouse</i> garnered five votes for a single rationale: Justice White agreed with the plurality as to the motivating-factor test, see <i>supra,</i> at 2354, n. 3; he disagreed only as to the type of evidence an employer was required to submit to prove that the same result would have occurred absent the unlawful motivation. Taking the plurality to demand objective evidence, he wrote separately to express his view that an employer's credible testimony could suffice. 490 U.S., at 261, 109 S.Ct. 1775. Because Justice White provided a fifth vote for the \"rationale explaining the result\" of the <i>Price Waterhouse</i> decision, <i>Marks,</i> 430 U.S., at 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, his concurrence is properly understood as controlling, and he, like the plurality, did not require the introduction of direct evidence.</p>\n<p>Any questions raised by <i>Price Waterhouse</i> as to a direct evidence requirement were settled by this Court's unanimous decision in <i>Desert Palace,</i> in which we held that a plaintiff need not introduce direct evidence to meet her burden in a mixed-motives case under Title VII, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. In construing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2358</span> the language of § 2000e-2(m), we reasoned that the statute did not mention, much less require, a heightened showing through direct evidence and that \"Congress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements.\" 539 U.S., at 99, 123 S.Ct. 2148. The statute's silence with respect to direct evidence, we held, meant that \"we should not depart from the `[c]onventional rul[e] of civil litigation... [that] requires a plaintiff to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence', ... using `direct or circumstantial evidence.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S., at 253, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion), and <i>Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110899\"><a href=\"/opinion/110899/postal-service-bd-of-governors-v-aikens/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983)). We also recognized the Court's consistent acknowledgment of the utility of circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases.</p>\n<p>Our analysis in <i>Desert Palace</i> applies with equal force to the ADEA. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2351-2352, n. 4. As with the 1991 amendments to Title VII, no language in the ADEA imposes a heightened direct evidence requirement, and we have specifically recognized the utility of circumstantial evidence in ADEA cases. See <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S., at 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (cited by <i>Desert Palace,</i> 539 U.S., at 99-100, 123 S.Ct. 2148). Moreover, in <i>Hazen Paper Co.,</i> we held that an award of liquidated damages for a \"willful\" violation of the ADEA did not require proof of the employer's motivation through direct evidence, 507 U.S., at 615, 113 S.Ct. 1701, and we have similarly rejected the imposition of special evidentiary rules in other ADEA cases. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118482\"><a href=\"/opinion/118482/swierkiewicz-v-sorema-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002); <i>O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118014\"><a href=\"/opinion/118014/oconnor-v-consolidated-coin-caterers-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996). <i>Desert Palace</i> thus confirms the answer provided by the plurality and Justice White in <i>Price Waterhouse:</i> An ADEA plaintiff need not present direct evidence of discrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The Court's endorsement of a different construction of the same critical language in the ADEA and Title VII is both unwise and inconsistent with settled law. The but-for standard the Court adopts was rejected by this Court in <i>Price Waterhouse</i> and by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Yet today the Court resurrects the standard in an unabashed display of judicial lawmaking. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, with whom Justice SOUTER and Justice GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice STEVENS that mixed-motive instructions are appropriate in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act context. And I join his opinion. The Court rejects this conclusion on the ground that the words \"because of\" require a plaintiff to prove that age was the \"but-for\" cause of his employer's adverse employment action. <i>Ante,</i> at 2350. But the majority does not explain why this is so. The words \"because of\" do not inherently require a showing of \"but-for\" causation, and I see no reason to read them to require such a showing.</p>\n<p>It is one thing to require a typical tort plaintiff to show \"but-for\" causation. In that context, reasonably objective scientific or commonsense theories of physical causation make the concept of \"but-for\" causation comparatively easy to understand and relatively easy to apply. But it is an entirely different matter to determine a \"but-for\" relation when we consider, not physical forces, but the mind-related characterizations that constitute motive. Sometimes we speak of <i>determining</i> or <i>discovering</i> motives, but more often we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2359</span> <i>ascribe</i> motives, after an event, to an individual in light of the individual's thoughts and other circumstances present at the time of decision. In a case where we characterize an employer's actions as having been taken out of multiple motives, say, both because the employee was old and because he wore loud clothing, to apply \"but-for\" causation is to engage in a hypothetical inquiry about what would have happened if the employer's thoughts and other circumstances had been different. The answer to this hypothetical inquiry will often be far from obvious, and, since the employee likely knows less than does the employer about what the employer was thinking at the time, the employer will often be in a stronger position than the employee to provide the answer.</p>\n<p>All that a plaintiff can know for certain in such a context is that the forbidden motive did play a role in the employer's decision. And the fact that a jury has found that age did play a role in the decision justifies the use of the word \"because,\" <i>i.e.,</i> the employer dismissed the employee because of his age (and other things). See <i>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 239-242, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion). I therefore would see nothing wrong in concluding that the plaintiff has established a violation of the statute.</p>\n<p>But the law need not automatically assess liability in these circumstances. In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> the plurality recognized an affirmative defense where the defendant could show that the employee would have been dismissed regardless. The law permits the employer this defense, not because the forbidden motive, age, had no role in the <i>actual</i> decision, but because the employer can show that he would have dismissed the employee anyway in the <i>hypothetical</i> circumstance in which his age-related motive was absent. And it makes sense that this would be an affirmative defense, rather than part of the showing of a violation, precisely because the defendant is in a better position than the plaintiff to establish how he would have acted in this hypothetical situation. See <i>id.,</i> at 242, 109 S.Ct. 1775; cf. <i>ante,</i> at 2356 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (describing the Title VII framework). I can see nothing unfair or impractical about allocating the burdens of proof in this way.</p>\n<p>The instruction that the District Court gave seems appropriate and lawful. It says, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Your verdict must be for plaintiff if all the following elements have been proved by the preponderance of the evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"[The] plaintiff's age was a motivating factor in defendant's decision to demote plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"However, your verdict must be for defendant ... if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that defendant would have demoted plaintiff regardless of his age.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>. . . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"As used in these instructions, plaintiff's age was `a motivating factor,' if plaintiff's age played a part or a role in the defendant's decision to demote plaintiff. However, plaintiff's age need not have been the only reason for defendant's decision to demote plaintiff.\" App. 9-10.</blockquote>\n<p>For these reasons as well as for those set forth by Justice STEVENS, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Although the parties did not specifically frame the question to include this threshold inquiry, \"[t]he statement of any question presented is deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included therein.\" This Court's Rule 14.1; see also <i>City of Sherrill v.

But the Court's approach to interpreting the ADEA in light of Title VII has not been uniform. In <i>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131162\"><a href=\"/opinion/131162/general-dynamics-land-systems-inc-v-cline/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 157 L.Ed.2d 1094 (2004), for example, the Court declined to interpret the phrase \"because of ... age\" in 29 U.S.C. § 623(a) to bar discrimination against people of all ages, even though the Court had previously interpreted \"because of... race [or] sex\" in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all races and both sexes, see 540 U.S., at 584, 592, n. 5, 124 S.Ct. 1236. And the Court has not definitively decided whether the evidentiary framework of <i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), utilized in Title VII cases is appropriate in the ADEA context. See <i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 142, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000); <i>O'Connor v.

In this instance, it is the textual differences between Title VII and the ADEA that prevent us from applying <i>Price Waterhouse</i> and <i>Desert Palace</i> to federal age discrimination claims.</p>\n<p>[3]  Justice BREYER contends that there is \"nothing unfair or impractical\" about hinging liability on whether \"forbidden motive ... play[ed] a role in the employer's decision.\" <i>Post,</i> at 2359 (dissenting opinion). But that is a decision for Congress to make. See <i>Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc.,</i> 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 2326, 2338-2339, 171 L.Ed.2d 203 (2008). Congress amended Title VII to allow for employer liability when discrimination \"was <i>a motivating factor</i> for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice,\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m) (emphasis added), but did not similarly amend the ADEA, see <i>supra,</i> at 2348-2349. We must give effect to Congress' choice. See <i>14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett,</i> 556 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1456, 1472, 173 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009).</p>\n<p>[4]  Because we hold that ADEA plaintiffs retain the burden of persuasion to prove all disparate-treatment claims, we do not need to address whether plaintiffs must present direct, rather than circumstantial, evidence to obtain a burden-shifting instruction. There is no heightened evidentiary requirement for ADEA plaintiffs to satisfy their burden of persuasion that age was the \"but-for\" cause of their employer's adverse action, see 29 U.S.C. § 623(a), and we will imply none. \"Congress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements\" in other statutory contexts, including in other subsections within Title 29, when it has seen fit. See <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 99, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003); see also, <i>e.g.,</i> 25 U.S.C. § 2504(b)(2)(B) (imposing \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard); 29 U.S.C. § 722(a)(2)(A) (same).</p>\n<p>[5]  Justice STEVENS also contends that we must apply <i>Price Waterhouse</i> under the reasoning of <i>Smith v. City of Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 125 S.Ct. 1536, 161 L.Ed.2d 410 (2005). See <i>post,</i> at 2356. In <i>Smith,</i> the Court applied to the ADEA its pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII with respect to disparate-impact claims despite Congress' 1991 amendment adding disparate-impact claims to Title VII but not the ADEA. 544 U.S., at 240, 125 S.Ct. 1536. But the amendments made by Congress in this same legislation, which added the \"motivating factor\" language to Title VII, undermine Justice STEVENS' argument. Congress not only explicitly added \"motivating factor\" liability to Title VII, see <i>supra,</i> at 2348-2349, but it also partially abrogated <i>Price Waterhouse</i>'s holding by eliminating an employer's complete affirmative defense to \"motivating factor\" claims, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B). If such \"motivating factor\" claims were already part of Title VII, the addition of § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B) alone would have been sufficient. Congress' careful tailoring of the \"motivating factor\" claim in Title VII, as well as the absence of a provision parallel to § 2000e-2(m) in the ADEA, confirms that we cannot transfer the <i>Price Waterhouse</i> burden-shifting framework into the ADEA.</p>\n<p>[6]  Gross points out that the Court has also applied a burden-shifting framework to certain claims brought in contexts other than pursuant to Title VII. See Brief for Petitioner 54-55 (citing, <i>inter alia, </i><i>NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110966\"><a href=\"/opinion/110966/nlrb-v-transportation-management-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 401-403, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983) (claims brought under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)); <i>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.

These cases, however, do not require the Court to adopt his contra statutory position. The case involving the NLRA did not require the Court to decide in the first instance whether burden shifting should apply as the Court instead deferred to the National Labor Relation Board's determination that such a framework was appropriate. See <i>NLRB, supra,</i> at 400-403, 103 S.Ct. 2469. And the constitutional cases such as <i>Mt. Healthy</i> have no bearing on the correct interpretation of ADEA claims, which are governed by statutory text.</p>\n<p>[1]  \"The question presented by the petitioner in this case is whether a plaintiff must present direct evidence of age discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motives jury instruction in a suit brought under the [ADEA].\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2346.</p>\n<p>[2]  The United States filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> brief supporting petitioner on the question presented. At oral argument, the Government urged that the Court should not reach the issue it takes up today. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21, 28-29.</p>\n<p>[3]  Although Justice White stated that the plaintiff had to show that her sex was a \"substantial\" factor, while the plurality used the term \"motivating\" factor, these standards are interchangeable, as evidenced by Justice White's quotation of <i>Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109574\"><a href=\"/opinion/109574/mt-healthy-city-bd-of-ed-v-doyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977): \"`[T]he burden was properly placed upon [the plaintiff to show that the illegitimate criterion] was a \"substantial factor\"  or, <i>to put it in other words,</i> that it was a \"motivating factor\"'\" in the adverse decision. <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> 490 U.S., at 259, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (emphasis added); see also <i>id.,</i> at 249, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion) (using \"substantial\" and \"motivating\" interchangeably).</p>\n<p>[4]  We were no doubt aware that dictionaries define \"because of\" as \"by reason of\" or \"on account of.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 2350. Contrary to the majority's bald assertion, however, this does not establish that the term denotes but-for causation. The dictionaries the Court cites do not, for instance, define \"because of\" as \"<i>solely</i> by reason of\" or \"<i>exclusively</i> on account of.\" In <i>Price Waterhouse,</i> we recognized that the words \"because of\" do not mean \"<i>solely</i> because of,\" and we held that the inquiry \"commanded by the words\" of the statute was whether gender was a motivating factor in the employment decision. 490 U.S., at 241, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>[5]  See <i>Febres v.

See H.R. Rep., pt. 2, at 4 (noting that a \"number of other laws banning discrimination, including ... the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. § 621, et seq., are modeled after and have been interpreted in a manner consistent with Title VII,\" and that \"these other laws modeled after Title VII [should] be interpreted consistently in a manner consistent with Title VII as amended by this Act,\" including the mixed-motives provisions).</p>\n<p>[7]  While Justice O'Connor did not define precisely what she meant by \"direct evidence,\" we contrasted such evidence with circumstantial evidence in <i>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003). That Justice O'Connor might have intended a different definition does not affect my conclusion, as I do not believe a plaintiff is required to introduce any special type of evidence to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.</p>\n\n</div>", "id": 145857, "judges": "Thomas", "local_path": "pdf/2009/06/18/Gross_v._FBL_Financial_Services_Inc..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 31, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009\nPetitioner Gross filed suit, alleging that respondent (FBL) demoted him\n  in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967\n  (ADEA), which makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse ac\n  tion against an employee “because of such individual’s age,” 29\n  U. S. C. §623(a). At the close of trial, and over FBL’s objections, the\n  District Court instructed the jury to enter a verdict for Gross if he\n  proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was demoted and\n  his age was a motivating factor in the demotion decision, and told the\n  jury that age was a motivating factor if it played a part in the demo\n  tion. It also instructed the jury to return a verdict for FBL if it\n  proved that it would have demoted Gross regardless of age. The jury\n  returned a verdict for Gross. The Eighth Circuit reversed and re\n  manded for a new trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly in\n  structed under the standard established in Price Waterhouse v. Hop\n  kins, 490 U. S. 228, for cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n  1964 when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse employ\n  ment action because of both permissible and impermissible consid\n  erations—i.e., a “mixed-motives” case.\nHeld: A plaintiff bringing an ADEA disparate-treatment claim must\n prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the “but-for”\n cause of the challenged adverse employment action. The burden of\n persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have\n taken the action regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has pro\n duced some evidence that age was one motivating factor in that deci\n sion. Pp. 4–12.\n    (a) Because Title VII is materially different with respect to the\n relevant burden of persuasion, this Court’s interpretation of the\n ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as Price Water\n2             GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    house and Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90, 94–95. This\n    Court has never applied Title VII’s burden-shifting framework to\n    ADEA claims and declines to do so now. When conducting statutory\n    interpretation, the Court “must be careful not to apply rules applica\n    ble under one statute to a different statute without careful and criti\n    cal examination.” Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U. S. ___,\n    ___. Unlike Title VII, which has been amended to explicitly author\n    ize discrimination claims where an improper consideration was “a\n    motivating factor” for the adverse action, see 42 U. S. C. §§2000e–\n    2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B), the ADEA does not provide that a plaintiff\n    may establish discrimination by showing that age was simply a moti\n    vating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to add such a provision\n    to the ADEA when it added §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B) to Ti\n    tle VII, even though it contemporaneously amended the ADEA in\n    several ways. When Congress amends one statutory provision but\n    not another, it is presumed to have acted intentionally, see EEOC v.\n    Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 256, and “negative implica\n    tions raised by disparate provisions are strongest” where the provi\n    sions were “considered simultaneously when the language raising the\n    implication was inserted,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 330.\n    Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) The ADEA’s text does not authorize an alleged mixed-motives\n    age discrimination claim. The ordinary meaning of the ADEA’s re\n    quirement that an employer took adverse action “because of” age is\n    that age was the “reason” that the employer decided to act. See\n    Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610. To establish a dispa\n    rate-treatment claim under this plain language, a plaintiff must\n    prove that age was the “but-for” cause of the employer’s adverse deci\n    sion. See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___,\n    ___. It follows that under §623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden\n    of persuasion to establish that “but-for” cause. This Court has previ\n    ously held this to be the burden’s proper allocation in ADEA cases,\n    see, e.g., Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC, 554 U. S. ___, ___–\n    ___, ___–___, and nothing in the statute’s text indicates that Congress\n    has carved out an exception for a subset of ADEA cases. Where a\n    statute is “silent on the allocation of the burden of persuasion,” “the\n    ordinary default rule [is] that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to\n    prove their claims.” Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56. Hence, the\n    burden of persuasion is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as in\n    any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. Pp. 7–9.\n       (c) This Court rejects petitioner’s contention that the proper inter\n    pretation of the ADEA is nonetheless controlled by Price Waterhouse,\n    which initially established that the burden of persuasion shifted in\n    alleged mixed-motives Title VII claims. It is far from clear that the\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

The\n  problems associated with its application have eliminated any per\n  ceivable benefit to extending its framework to ADEA claims. Cf. Con\n  tinental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.

(FBL), in 1971. As of 2001,\nGross held the position of claims administration director.\nBut in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reas\nsigned to the position of claims project coordinator. At\nthat same time, FBL transferred many of Gross’ job re\nsponsibilities to a newly created position—claims admini\nstration manager.      That position was given to Lisa\nKneeskern, who had previously been supervised by Gross\nand who was then in her early forties. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 23a (District Court opinion). Although Gross (in his\n2          GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nnew position) and Kneeskern received the same compensa\ntion, Gross considered the reassignment a demotion be\ncause of FBL’s reallocation of his former job responsibili\nties to Kneeskern.\n   In April 2004, Gross filed suit in District Court, alleging\nthat his reassignment to the position of claims project\ncoordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it unlawful\nfor an employer to take adverse action against an em\nployee “because of such individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C.\n§623(a). The case proceeded to trial, where Gross intro\nduced evidence suggesting that his reassignment was\nbased at least in part on his age. FBL defended its deci\nsion on the grounds that Gross’ reassignment was part of\na corporate restructuring and that Gross’ new position was\nbetter suited to his skills. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\n(District Court opinion).\n   At the close of trial, and over FBL’s objections, the\nDistrict Court instructed the jury that it must return a\nverdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that FBL “demoted [him] to claims projec[t]\ncoordinator” and that his “age was a motivating factor” in\nFBL’s decision to demote him. App. 9–10. The jury was\nfurther instructed that Gross’ age would qualify as a\n“ ‘motivating factor,’ if [it] played a part or a role in [FBL]’s\ndecision to demote [him].” Id., at 10. The jury was also\ninstructed regarding FBL’s burden of proof. According to\nthe District Court, the “verdict must be for [FBL] . . . if it\nhas been proved by the preponderance of the evidence that\n[FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.”\nIbid. The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him\n$46,945 in lost compensation. Id., at 8.\n   FBL challenged the jury instructions on appeal. The\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nreversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the\njury had been incorrectly instructed under the standard\nestablished in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(1989). See 526 F. 3d 356, 358 (2008). In Price Water\nhouse, this Court addressed the proper allocation of the\nburden of persuasion in cases brought under Title VII of\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42\nU. S. C. §2000e et seq., when an employee alleges that he\nsuffered an adverse employment action because of both\npermissible and impermissible considerations—i.e., a\n“mixed-motives” case. 490 U. S., at 232, 244–247 (plural\nity opinion). The Price Waterhouse decision was splin\ntered. Four Justices joined a plurality opinion, see id., at\n231–258, Justices White and O’Connor separately con\ncurred in the judgment, see id., at 258–261 (opinion of\nWhite, J.); id., at 261–279 (opinion of O’Connor, J.), and\nthree Justices dissented, see id., at 279–295 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). Six Justices ultimately agreed that if a\nTitle VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a “moti\nvating” or a “ ‘substantial’ ” factor in the employer’s action,\nthe burden of persuasion should shift to the employer to\nshow that it would have taken the same action regardless\nof that impermissible consideration. See id., at 258 (plu\nrality opinion); id., at 259–260 (opinion of White, J.); id.,\nat 276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). Justice O’Connor further\nfound that to shift the burden of persuasion to the em\nployer, the employee must present “direct evidence that an\nillegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [em\nployment] decision.” Id., at 276.\n   In accordance with Circuit precedent, the Court of Ap\npeals identified Justice O’Connor’s opinion as controlling.\nSee 526 F. 3d, at 359 (citing Erickson v. Farmland Indus\ntries, Inc., 271 F. 3d 718, 724 (CA8 2001)). Applying that\nstandard, the Court of Appeals found that Gross needed to\npresent “[d]irect evidence . . . sufficient to support a find\ning by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate crite\nrion actually motivated the adverse employment action.”\n526 F. 3d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nthe Court of Appeals’ view, “direct evidence” is only that\n4         GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence that “show[s] a specific link between the alleged\ndiscriminatory animus and the challenged decision.” Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Only upon a presen\ntation of such evidence, the Court of Appeals held, should\nthe burden shift to the employer “ ‘to convince the trier of\nfact that it is more likely than not that the decision would\nhave been the same absent consideration of the illegiti\nmate factor.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Price Waterhouse, supra, at\n276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.)).\n   The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the District\nCourt’s jury instructions were flawed because they allowed\nthe burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a pre\nponderance of any category of evidence showing that age\nwas a motivating factor—not just “direct evidence” related\nto FBL’s alleged consideration of age. See 526 F. 3d, at\n360. Because Gross conceded that he had not presented\ndirect evidence of discrimination, the Court of Appeals\nheld that the District Court should not have given the\nmixed-motives instruction. Ibid. Rather, Gross should\nhave been held to the burden of persuasion applicable to\ntypical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus should\nhave been instructed only to determine whether Gross had\ncarried his burden of “prov[ing] that age was the deter\nmining factor in FBL’s employment action.” See ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\nvacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n                            II\n  The parties have asked us to decide whether a plaintiff\nmust “present direct evidence of discrimination in order to\nobtain a mixed-motive instruction in a non-Title VII dis\ncrimination case.” Pet. for Cert. i. Before reaching this\nquestion, however, we must first determine whether the\nburden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an\nalleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ADEA.1 We hold that it does not.\n                              A\n   Petitioner relies on this Court’s decisions construing\nTitle VII for his interpretation of the ADEA. Because\nTitle VII is materially different with respect to the rele\nvant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not\ncontrol our construction of the ADEA.\n   In Price Waterhouse, a plurality of the Court and two\nJustices concurring in the judgment determined that once\na “plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that [the plaintiff’s\nmembership in a protected class] played a motivating part\nin an employment decision, the defendant may avoid a\nfinding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that it would have made the same decision\neven if it had not taken [that factor] into account.” 490\nU. S., at 258; see also id., at 259–260 (opinion of White,\nJ.); id., at 276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). But as we ex\nplained in Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90, 94–95\n(2003), Congress has since amended Title VII by explicitly\nauthorizing discrimination claims in which an improper\nconsideration was “a motivating factor” for an adverse\nemployment decision. See 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(m) (pro\nviding that “an unlawful employment practice is estab\nlished when the complaining party demonstrates that\n——————\n  1 Although the parties did not specifically frame the question to in\n\nclude this threshold inquiry, “[t]he statement of any question presented\nis deemed to comprise every subsidiary question fairly included\ntherein.” This Court’s Rule 14.1; see also City of Sherrill v. Oneida\nIndian Nation of N. Y., 544 U. S. 197, 214, n. 8 (2005) (“ ‘Questions not\nexplicitly mentioned but essential to the analysis of the decisions below\nor to the correct disposition of the other issues have been treated as\nsubsidiary issues fairly comprised by the question presented’ ” (quoting\nR. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice\n414 (8th ed. 2002))); Ballard v. Commissioner, 544 U. S. 40, 46–47, and\nn. 2 (2005) (evaluating “a question anterior” to the “questions the\nparties raised”).\n6          GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivat\ning factor for any employment practice, even though other\nfactors also motivated the practice” (emphasis added));\n§2000e–5(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to\nplaintiffs proving violations of §2000e–2(m)).\n   This Court has never held that this burden-shifting\nframework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline to do\nso now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we\n“must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one\nstatute to a different statute without careful and critical\nexamination.” Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2). Unlike Title VII, the\nADEA’s text does not provide that a plaintiff may estab\nlish discrimination by showing that age was simply a\nmotivating factor. Moreover, Congress neglected to add\nsuch a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title VII\nto add §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B), even though it\ncontemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways,\nsee Civil Rights Act of 1991, §115, 105 Stat. 1079; id.,\n§302, at 1088.\n   We cannot ignore Congress’ decision to amend Title\nVII’s relevant provisions but not make similar changes to\nthe ADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provi\nsion but not another, it is presumed to have acted inten\ntionally. See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499\nU. S. 244, 256 (1991). Furthermore, as the Court has\nexplained, “negative implications raised by disparate\nprovisions are strongest” when the provisions were “con\nsidered simultaneously when the language raising the\nimplication was inserted.” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.\n320, 330 (1997). As a result, the Court’s interpretation of\nthe ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as\nDesert Palace and Price Waterhouse.2\n——————\n  2 JUSTICE STEVENS argues that the Court must incorporate its past\n\ninterpretations of Title VII into the ADEA because “the substantive\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the\nADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives\nage discrimination claim. It does not. “Statutory con\nstruction must begin with the language employed by\nCongress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning\nof that language accurately expresses the legislative pur\npose.” Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality\nManagement Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 252 (2004) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The ADEA provides, in rele\nvant part, that “[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer . . .\nto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or\notherwise discriminate against any individual with re\nspect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment, because of such individual’s age.” 29\nU. S. C. §623(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n   The words “because of” mean “by reason of: on account\nof.” 1 Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 194\n(1966); see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746 (1933)\n——————\nprovisions of the ADEA were derived in haec verba from Title VII,” post,\nat 4 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\nbecause the Court has frequently applied its interpretations of Title VII\nto the ADEA, see post, at 4–6. But the Court’s approach to interpreting\nthe ADEA in light of Title VII has not been uniform. In General Dy\nnamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 (2004), for example,\nthe Court declined to interpret the phrase “because of . . . age” in 29\nU. S. C. §623(a) to bar discrimination against people of all ages, even\nthough the Court had previously interpreted “because of . . . race [or]\nsex” in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all races and\nboth sexes, see 540 U. S., at 584, 592, n. 5. And the Court has not\ndefinitively decided whether the evidentiary framework of McDonnell\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), utilized in Title VII cases\nis appropriate in the ADEA context. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing\nProducts, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 142 (2000); O’Connor v. Consolidated Coin\nCaterers Corp., 517 U. S. 308, 311 (1996). In this instance, it is the\ntextual differences between Title VII and the ADEA that prevent us\nfrom applying Price Waterhouse and Desert Palace to federal age\ndiscrimination claims.\n8            GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n(defining “because of” to mean “By reason of, on account\nof” (italics in original)); The Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 132 (1966) (defining “because” to\nmean “by reason; on account”). Thus, the ordinary mean\ning of the ADEA’s requirement that an employer took\nadverse action “because of” age is that age was the “rea\nson” that the employer decided to act. See Hazen Paper\nCo. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993) (explaining that\nthe claim “cannot succeed unless the employee’s protected\ntrait actually played a role in [the employer’s decisionmak\ning] process and had a determinative influence on the\noutcome” (emphasis added)). To establish a disparate\ntreatment claim under the plain language of the ADEA,\ntherefore, a plaintiff must prove that age was the “but-for”\ncause of the employer’s adverse decision. See Bridge v.\nPhoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(slip op., at 14) (recognizing that the phrase, “by reason\nof,” requires at least a showing of “but for” causation\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Safeco Ins.

S. 47, 63–64, and n. 14 (2007)\n(observing that “[i]n common talk, the phrase ‘based on’\nindicates a but-for causal relationship and thus a neces\nsary logical condition” and that the statutory phrase,\n“based on,” has the same meaning as the phrase, “because\nof” (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts 265 (5th ed. 1984) (“An act or omission is not\nregarded as a cause of an event if the particular event\nwould have occurred without it”).3\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE BREYER contends that there is “nothing unfair or impracti\n\ncal” about hinging liability on whether “forbidden motive . . . play[ed] a\nrole in the employer’s decision.” Post, at 2–3 (dissenting opinion). But\nthat is a decision for Congress to make. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v.\nPiccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 18).\nCongress amended Title VII to allow for employer liability when\ndiscrimination “was a motivating factor for any employment practice,\n                    Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   It follows, then, that under §623(a)(1), the plaintiff\nretains the burden of persuasion to establish that age was\nthe “but-for” cause of the employer’s adverse action. In\ndeed, we have previously held that the burden is allocated\nin this manner in ADEA cases. See Kentucky Retirement\nSystems v. EEOC, 554 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___–___ (2008)\n(slip op., at 2–4, 11–13); Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing\nProducts, Inc., 530 U. S. 133, 141, 143 (2000). And noth\ning in the statute’s text indicates that Congress has carved\nout an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases.\nWhere the statutory text is “silent on the allocation of the\nburden of persuasion,” we “begin with the ordinary default\nrule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their\nclaims.” Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56 (2005); see\nalso Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, 554\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6) (“Absent some reason\nto believe that Congress intended otherwise, . . . we will\nconclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usu\nally falls, upon the party seeking relief” (internal quota\ntion marks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from\nthe general rule in this setting.\n   Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to establish\nemployer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives\ncases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A\nplaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n(which may be direct or circumstantial), that age was the\n“but-for” cause of the challenged employer decision. See\nReeves, supra, at 141–143, 147.4\n——————\neven though other factors also motivated the practice,” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–2(m) (emphasis added), but did not similarly amend the ADEA,\nsee supra, at 5–6. We must give effect to Congress’ choice. See 14 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21).\n  4 Because we hold that ADEA plaintiffs retain the burden of persua\n\nsion to prove all disparate-treatment claims, we do not need to address\nwhether plaintiffs must present direct, rather than circumstantial,\nevidence to obtain a burden-shifting instruction. There is no height\n10           GROSS v.

Cf. 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21) (declining to “intro\nduc[e] a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in\nits text”); Meacham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (explain\ning that the ADEA must be “read . . . the way Congress\nwrote it”).\n——————\nened evidentiary requirement for ADEA plaintiffs to satisfy their\nburden of persuasion that age was the “but-for” cause of their em\nployer’s adverse action, see 29 U. S. C. §623(a), and we will imply none.\n“Congress has been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof\nrequirements” in other statutory contexts, including in other subsec\ntions within Title 29, when it has seen fit. See Desert Palace, Inc. v.\nCosta, 539 U. S. 90, 99 (2003); see also, e.g., 25 U. S. C. §2504(b)(2)(B)\n(imposing “clear and convincing evidence” standard); 29 U. S. C.\n§722(a)(2)(A) (same).\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS also contends that we must apply Price Water\n\nhouse under the reasoning of Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228\n(2005). See post, at 7. In Smith, the Court applied to the ADEA its\npre-1991 interpretation of Title VII with respect to disparate-impact\nclaims despite Congress’ 1991 amendment adding disparate-impact\nclaims to Title VII but not the ADEA. 544 U. S., at 240. But the\namendments made by Congress in this same legislation, which added\nthe “motivating factor” language to Title VII, undermine JUSTICE\nSTEVENS’ argument. Congress not only explicitly added “motivating\nfactor” liability to Title VII, see supra, at 5–6, but it also partially\nabrogated Price Waterhouse’s holding by eliminating an employer’s\ncomplete affirmative defense to “motivating factor” claims, see 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–5(g)(2)(B). If such “motivating factor” claims were\nalready part of Title VII, the addition of §2000e–5(g)(2)(B) alone would\nhave been sufficient. Congress’ careful tailoring of the “motivating\nfactor” claim in Title VII, as well as the absence of a provision parallel\nto §2000e–2(m) in the ADEA, confirms that we cannot transfer the\nPrice Waterhouse burden-shifting framework into the ADEA.\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Whatever the deficiencies of Price Waterhouse in retro\nspect, it has become evident in the years since that case\nwas decided that its burden-shifting framework is difficult\nto apply. For example, in cases tried to a jury, courts have\nfound it particularly difficult to craft an instruction to\nexplain its burden-shifting framework. See, e.g., Tyler v.\nBethlehem Steel Corp., 958 F. 2d 1176, 1179 (CA2 1992)\n(referring to “the murky water of shifting burdens in\ndiscrimination cases”); Visser v. Packer Engineering Asso\nciates, Inc., 924 F. 2d 655, 661 (CA7 1991) (en banc)\n(Flaum, J., dissenting) (“The difficulty judges have in\nformulating [burden-shifting] instructions and jurors have\nin applying them can be seen in the fact that jury verdicts\nin ADEA cases are supplanted by judgments notwith\nstanding the verdict or reversed on appeal more frequently\nthan jury verdicts generally”). Thus, even if Price Water\nhouse was doctrinally sound, the problems associated with\nits application have eliminated any perceivable benefit to\nextending its framework to ADEA claims. Cf. Continental\nT. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47 (1977)\n(reevaluating precedent that was subject to criticism\nand “continuing controversy and confusion”); Payne v.\nTennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 839–844 (1991) (SOUTER, J.,\nconcurring).6\n——————\n   6 Gross points out that the Court has also applied a burden-shifting\n\nframework to certain claims brought in contexts other than pursuant to\nTitle VII. See Brief for Petitioner 54–55 (citing, inter alia, NLRB v.\nTransportation Management Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 401–403 (1983)\n(claims brought under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)); Mt.\nHealthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 287 (1977) (constitu\ntional claims)). These cases, however, do not require the Court to adopt\nhis contra statutory position. The case involving the NLRA did not\nrequire the Court to decide in the first instance whether burden shift\ning should apply as the Court instead deferred to the National Labor\nRelation Board’s determination that such a framework was appropri\nate. See NLRB, supra, at 400–403. And the constitutional cases such\nas Mt. Healthy have no bearing on the correct interpretation of ADEA\n12          GROSS v.

S. C. §621 et seq., makes it unlawful for an\nemployer to discriminate against any employee “because\nof” that individual’s age, §623(a). The most natural read\ning of this statutory text prohibits adverse employment\nactions motivated in whole or in part by the age of the\nemployee. The “but-for” causation standard endorsed by\nthe Court today was advanced in JUSTICE KENNEDY’s\ndissenting opinion in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490\nU. S. 228, 279 (1989), a case construing identical language\nin Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–2(a)(1). Not only did the Court reject the but-for\nstandard in that case, but so too did Congress when it\namended Title VII in 1991. Given this unambiguous his\ntory, it is particularly inappropriate for the Court, on its\nown initiative, to adopt an interpretation of the causation\nrequirement in the ADEA that differs from the established\nreading of Title VII. I disagree not only with the Court’s\ninterpretation of the statute, but also with its decision to\nengage in unnecessary lawmaking. I would simply answer\nthe question presented by the certiorari petition and hold\nthat a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age\ndiscrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.\n2            GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                              I\n   The Court asks whether a mixed-motives instruction is\never appropriate in an ADEA case. As it acknowledges,\nthis was not the question we granted certiorari to decide.1\nInstead, the question arose for the first time in respon\ndent’s brief, which asked us to “overrule Price Waterhouse\nwith respect to its application to the ADEA.” Brief for\nRespondent 26 (boldface type deleted). In the usual\ncourse, this Court would not entertain such a request\nraised only in a merits brief: “ ‘We would normally expect\nnotice of an intent to make so far-reaching an argument in\nthe respondent’s opposition to a petition for certiorari, cf.\nthis Court’s Rule 15.2, thereby assuring adequate prepa\nration time for those likely affected and wishing to partici\npate.’ ” Alabama v. Shelton, 535 U. S. 654, 660, n. 3 (2002)\n(quoting South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama,\n526 U. S. 160, 171 (1999)). Yet the Court is unconcerned\nthat the question it chooses to answer has not been briefed\nby the parties or interested amici curiae. Its failure to\nconsider the views of the United States, which represents\nthe agency charged with administering the ADEA, is\nespecially irresponsible.2\n   Unfortunately, the majority’s inattention to prudential\nCourt practices is matched by its utter disregard of our\nprecedent and Congress’ intent. The ADEA provides that\n“[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer . . . to fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise dis\ncriminate against any individual with respect to his com\n——————\n    1 “Thequestion presented by the petitioner in this case is whether a\nplaintiff must present direct evidence of age discrimination in order to\nobtain a mixed-motives jury instruction in a suit brought under the\n[ADEA].” Ante, at 1.\n  2 The United States filed an amicus curiae brief supporting petitioner\n\non the question presented.

C. §623(a)(1)\n(emphasis added). As we recognized in Price Waterhouse\nwhen we construed the identical “because of” language of\nTitle VII, see 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1) (making it unlaw\nful for an employer “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\nany individual . . . with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin” (emphasis added)), the most natural reading of the\ntext proscribes adverse employment actions motivated in\nwhole or in part by the age of the employee.\n   In Price Waterhouse, we concluded that the words “ ‘be\ncause of’ such individual’s . . . sex . . . mean that gender\nmust be irrelevant to employment decisions.” 490 U. S., at\n240 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 260 (White, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). To establish a violation of Title\nVII, we therefore held, a plaintiff had to prove that her sex\nwas a motivating factor in an adverse employment deci\nsion.3 We recognized that the employer had an affirmative\ndefense: It could avoid a finding of liability by proving that\nit would have made the same decision even if it had not\ntaken the plaintiff’s sex into account. Id., at 244–245\n(plurality opinion). But this affirmative defense did not\nalter the meaning of “because of.” As we made clear, when\n“an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors\nat the time of making a decision, that decision was ‘be\n——————\n  3 Although Justice White stated that the plaintiff had to show that\n\nher sex was a “substantial” factor, while the plurality used the term\n“motivating” factor, these standards are interchangeable, as evidenced\nby Justice White’s quotation of Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429\nU. S. 274, 287 (1977): “ ‘[T]he burden was properly placed upon [the\nplaintiff to show that the illegitimate criterion] was a “substantial\nfactor”—or, to put it in other words, that it was a “motivating factor” ’ ”\nin the adverse decision. Price Waterhouse, 490 U. S., at 259 (emphasis\nadded); see also id., at 249 (plurality opinion) (using “substantial” and\n“motivating” interchangeably).\n4            GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncause of’ sex.” Id., at 241; see also id., at 260 (White, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). We readily rejected the dissent’s\ncontrary assertion. “To construe the words ‘because of ’ as\ncolloquial shorthand for ‘but-for’ causation,” we said, “is to\nmisunderstand them.” Id., at 240 (plurality opinion).4\n   Today, however, the Court interprets the words “be\ncause of” in the ADEA “as colloquial shorthand for ‘but-for’\ncausation.” Ibid. That the Court is construing the ADEA\nrather than Title VII does not justify this departure from\nprecedent. The relevant language in the two statutes is\nidentical, and we have long recognized that our interpreta\ntions of Title VII’s language apply “with equal force in the\ncontext of age discrimination, for the substantive provi\nsions of the ADEA ‘were derived in haec verba from Title\nVII.’ ” Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S.\n111, 121 (1985) (quoting Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575,\n584 (1978)). See generally Northcross v. Board of Ed. of\nMemphis City Schools, 412 U. S. 427, 428 (1973) (per\ncuriam). For this reason, JUSTICE KENNEDY’s dissent in\nPrice Waterhouse assumed the plurality’s mixed-motives\nframework extended to the ADEA, see 490 U. S., at 292,\nand the Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue\nunanimously have applied Price Waterhouse to ADEA\nclaims.5\n——————\n   4 We were no doubt aware that dictionaries define “because of” as “by\n\nreason of” or “on account of.” Ante, at 7–8. Contrary to the majority’s\nbald assertion, however, this does not establish that the term denotes\nbut-for causation. The dictionaries the Court cites do not, for instance,\ndefine “because of” as “solely by reason of” or “exclusively on account of.”\nIn Price Waterhouse, we recognized that the words “because of” do not\nmean “solely because of,” and we held that the inquiry “commanded by\nthe words” of the statute was whether gender was a motivating factor\nin the employment decision. 490 U.

In particular, the Court relies on our statement in\nHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993), that\n“[a disparate-treatment] claim ‘cannot succeed unless the\nemployee’s protected trait actually played a role in [the\nemployer’s decisionmaking] process and had a determina\ntive influence on the outcome.’ ” Ante, at 8. The italicized\nphrase is at best inconclusive as to the meaning of the\nADEA’s “because of” language, however, as other passages\nin Hazen Paper Co. demonstrate. We also stated, for\ninstance, that the ADEA “requires the employer to ignore\nan employee’s age,” id., at 612 (emphasis added), and\nnoted that “[w]hen the employer’s decision is wholly moti\nvated by factors other than age,” there is no violation, id.,\nat 611 (emphasis altered). So too, we indicated the “possi\nbility of dual liability under ERISA and the ADEA where\nthe decision to fire the employee was motivated both by\nthe employee’s age and by his pension status,” id., at\n613—a classic mixed-motives scenario.\n   Moreover, both Hazen Paper Co. and Reeves v. Sander\nson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U. S. 133 (2000), on\nwhich the majority also relies, support the conclusion that\nthe ADEA should be interpreted consistently with Title\nVII. In those non-mixed-motives ADEA cases, the Court\nfollowed the standards set forth in non-mixed-motives\nTitle VII cases including McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nGreen, 411 U. S. 792 (1973), and Texas Dept. of Commu\nnity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248 (1981). See, e.g.,\nReeves, 530 U. S., at 141–143; Hazen Paper Co., 507 U. S.,\n——————\nIn The Box, Inc., 376 F. 3d 305 (CA5 2004); Wexler v. White’s Fine\nFurniture, Inc., 317 F. 3d 564 (CA6 2003); Visser v. Packer Eng. Assocs.,\nInc., 924 F. 2d 655 (CA7 1991) (en banc); Hutson v. McDonnell Douglas\nCorp., 63 F. 3d 771 (CA8 1995); Lewis v. YMCA, 208 F. 3d 1303 (CA11\n2000) (per curiam); see also Gonzagowski v.

This by no means indicates, as the majority rea\nsons, that mixed-motives ADEA cases should follow those\nstandards. Rather, it underscores that ADEA standards\nare generally understood to conform to Title VII standards.\n                               II\n   The conclusion that “because of” an individual’s age\nmeans that age was a motivating factor in an employment\ndecision is bolstered by Congress’ reaction to Price Water\nhouse in the 1991 Civil Rights Act. As part of its response\nto “a number of recent decisions by the United States\nSupreme Court that sharply cut back on the scope and\neffectiveness of [civil rights] laws,” H. R. Rep. No. 102–40,\npt. 2, p. 2 (1991) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.), Congress elimi\nnated the affirmative defense to liability that Price Water\nhouse had furnished employers and provided instead that\nan employer’s same-decision showing would limit only a\nplaintiff’s remedies. See §2000e–5(g)(2)(B). Importantly,\nhowever, Congress ratified Price Waterhouse’s interpreta\ntion of the plaintiff’s burden of proof, rejecting the dis\nsent’s suggestion in that case that but-for causation was\nthe proper standard. See §2000e–2(m) (“[A]n unlawful\nemployment practice is established when the complaining\nparty demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or na\ntional origin was a motivating factor for any employment\npractice, even though other factors also motivated the\npractice”).\n   Because the 1991 Act amended only Title VII and not\nthe ADEA with respect to mixed-motives claims, the Court\nreasonably declines to apply the amended provisions to\nthe ADEA.6 But it proceeds to ignore the conclusion com\n——————\n  6 There is, however, some evidence that Congress intended the 1991\n\nmixed-motives amendments to apply to the ADEA as well. See H. R.\nRep., pt. 2, at 4 (noting that a “number of other laws banning discrimi\nnation, including . . . the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n(ADEA), 29 U. S.

City of Jackson, 544\nU. S. 228, 240 (2005), is precisely on point, as we consid\nered in that case the effect of Congress’ failure to amend\nthe disparate-impact provisions of the ADEA when it\namended the corresponding Title VII provisions in the\n1991 Act. Noting that “the relevant 1991 amendments\nexpanded the coverage of Title VII [but] did not amend the\nADEA or speak to the subject of age discrimination,” we\nheld that “Wards Cove’s pre-1991 interpretation of Title\nVII’s identical language remains applicable to the ADEA.”\n544 U. S., at 240 (discussing Wards Cove Packing Co. v.\nAtonio, 490 U. S. 642 (1989)); see also Meacham v. Knolls\nAtomic Power Laboratory, 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip\nop., at 15). If the Wards Cove disparate-impact framework\nthat Congress flatly repudiated in the Title VII context\ncontinues to apply to ADEA claims, the mixed-motives\nframework that Congress substantially endorsed surely\napplies.\n  Curiously, the Court reaches the opposite conclusion,\nrelying on Congress’ partial ratification of Price Water\nhouse to argue against that case’s precedential value. It\nreasons that if the 1991 amendments do not apply to the\nADEA, Price Waterhouse likewise must not apply because\nCongress effectively codified Price Waterhouse’s holding in\nthe amendments. Ante, at 5–6. This does not follow. To\nthe contrary, the fact that Congress endorsed this Court’s\ninterpretation of the “because of” language in Price Water\nhouse (even as it rejected the employer’s affirmative de\n\n——————\ninterpreted in a manner consistent with Title VII,” and that “these\nother laws modeled after Title VII [should] be interpreted consistently\nin a manner consistent with Title VII as amended by this Act,” includ\ning the mixed-motives provisions).\n8          GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfense to liability) provides all the more reason to adhere to\nthat decision’s motivating-factor test. Indeed, Congress\nemphasized in passing the 1991 Act that the motivating\nfactor test was consistent with its original intent in enact\ning Title VII. See, e.g., H. R. Rep., pt. 2, at 17 (“When\nenacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress made clear\nthat it intended to prohibit all invidious consideration of\nsex, race, color, religion, or national origin in employment\ndecisions”); id., at 2 (stating that the Act “reaffirm[ed] that\nany reliance on prejudice in making employment decisions\nis illegal”); see also H. R. Rep., pt. 1, at 45; S. Rep. No.\n101–315, pp. 6, 22 (1990).\n   The 1991 amendments to Title VII also provide the\nanswer to the majority’s argument that the mixed-motives\napproach has proved unworkable. Ante, at 10–11. Be\ncause Congress has codified a mixed-motives framework\nfor Title VII cases—the vast majority of antidiscrimination\nlawsuits—the Court’s concerns about that framework are\nof no moment. Were the Court truly worried about diffi\nculties faced by trial courts and juries, moreover, it would\nnot reach today’s decision, which will further complicate\nevery case in which a plaintiff raises both ADEA and Title\nVII claims.\n   The Court’s resurrection of the but-for causation stan\ndard is unwarranted. Price Waterhouse repudiated that\nstandard 20 years ago, and Congress’ response to our\ndecision further militates against the crabbed interpreta\ntion the Court adopts today. The answer to the question\nthe Court has elected to take up—whether a mixed\nmotives jury instruction is ever proper in an ADEA case—\nis plainly yes.\n                             III\n  Although the Court declines to address the question we\ngranted certiorari to decide, I would answer that question\nby following our unanimous opinion in Desert Palace, Inc.\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nv. Costa, 539 U. S. 90 (2003). I would accordingly hold\nthat a plaintiff need not present direct evidence of age\ndiscrimination to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.\n   The source of the direct-evidence debate is Justice\nO’Connor’s opinion concurring in the judgment in Price\nWaterhouse. Writing only for herself, Justice O’Connor\nargued that a plaintiff should be required to introduce\n“direct evidence” that her sex motivated the decision\nbefore the plurality’s mixed-motives framework would\napply. 490 U. S., at 276.7 Many courts have treated Jus\ntice O’Connor’s opinion in Price Waterhouse as controlling\nfor both Title VII and ADEA mixed-motives cases in light\nof our statement in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188,\n193 (1977), that “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a\ncase and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may\nbe viewed as that position taken by those Members who\nconcurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.’ ”\nUnlike the cases Marks addressed, however, Price Water\nhouse garnered five votes for a single rationale: Justice\nWhite agreed with the plurality as to the motivating-factor\ntest, see supra, at 3, n. 3; he disagreed only as to the type\nof evidence an employer was required to submit to prove\nthat the same result would have occurred absent the\nunlawful motivation. Taking the plurality to demand\nobjective evidence, he wrote separately to express his view\nthat an employer’s credible testimony could suffice. 490\nU. S., at 261. Because Justice White provided a fifth vote\nfor the “rationale explaining the result” of the Price\nWaterhouse decision, Marks, 430 U. S., at 193, his concur\n——————\n  7 While Justice O’Connor did not define precisely what she meant by\n\n“direct evidence,” we contrasted such evidence with circumstantial\nevidence in Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90 (2003). That\nJustice O’Connor might have intended a different definition does not\naffect my conclusion, as I do not believe a plaintiff is required to intro\nduce any special type of evidence to obtain a mixed-motives instruction.\n10        GROSS v. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrence is properly understood as controlling, and he, like\nthe plurality, did not require the introduction of direct\nevidence.\n    Any questions raised by Price Waterhouse as to a direct\nevidence requirement were settled by this Court’s unani\nmous decision in Desert Palace, in which we held that a\nplaintiff need not introduce direct evidence to meet her\nburden in a mixed-motives case under Title VII, as\namended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. In construing\nthe language of §2000e–2(m), we reasoned that the statute\ndid not mention, much less require, a heightened showing\nthrough direct evidence and that “Congress has been\nunequivocal when imposing heightened proof require\nments.” 539 U. S., at 99. The statute’s silence with re\nspect to direct evidence, we held, meant that “we should\nnot depart from the ‘[c]onventional rul[e] of civil litigation\n. . . [that] requires a plaintiff to prove his case by a pre\nponderance of the evidence’, . . . using ‘direct or circum\nstantial evidence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Price Waterhouse, 490\nU. S., at 253 (plurality opinion), and Postal Service Bd. of\nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711 (1983)). We also recog\nnized the Court’s consistent acknowledgment of the utility\nof circumstantial evidence in discrimination cases.\n    Our analysis in Desert Palace applies with equal force to\nthe ADEA. Cf. ante, at 9–10, n. 4. As with the 1991\namendments to Title VII, no language in the ADEA im\nposes a heightened direct evidence requirement, and we\nhave specifically recognized the utility of circumstantial\nevidence in ADEA cases. See Reeves, 530 U. S., at 147\n(cited by Desert Palace, 539 U. S., at 99–100). Moreover,\nin Hazen Paper Co., we held that an award of liquidated\ndamages for a “willful” violation of the ADEA did not\nrequire proof of the employer’s motivation through direct\nevidence, 507 U. S., at 615, and we have similarly rejected\nthe imposition of special evidentiary rules in other ADEA\ncases. See, e.g., Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U. S.\n                Cite as: 557 U.

But the majority does not explain why\nthis is so. The words “because of” do not inherently re\nquire a showing of “but-for” causation, and I see no reason\nto read them to require such a showing.\n   It is one thing to require a typical tort plaintiff to show\n“but-for” causation. In that context, reasonably objective\nscientific or commonsense theories of physical causation\nmake the concept of “but-for” causation comparatively\neasy to understand and relatively easy to apply. But it is\nan entirely different matter to determine a “but-for” rela\ntion when we consider, not physical forces, but the mind\nrelated characterizations that constitute motive. Some\ntimes we speak of determining or discovering motives, but\nmore often we ascribe motives, after an event, to an indi\nvidual in light of the individual’s thoughts and other\ncircumstances present at the time of decision.

FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbeen taken out of multiple motives, say, both because the\nemployee was old and because he wore loud clothing, to\napply “but-for” causation is to engage in a hypothetical\ninquiry about what would have happened if the employer’s\nthoughts and other circumstances had been different. The\nanswer to this hypothetical inquiry will often be far from\nobvious, and, since the employee likely knows less than\ndoes the employer about what the employer was thinking\nat the time, the employer will often be in a stronger posi\ntion than the employee to provide the answer.\n   All that a plaintiff can know for certain in such a con\ntext is that the forbidden motive did play a role in the\nemployer’s decision. And the fact that a jury has found\nthat age did play a role in the decision justifies the use of\nthe word “because,” i.e., the employer dismissed the em\nployee because of his age (and other things). See Price\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 239–242 (1989)\n(plurality opinion). I therefore would see nothing wrong in\nconcluding that the plaintiff has established a violation of\nthe statute.\n   But the law need not automatically assess liability in\nthese circumstances. In Price Waterhouse, the plurality\nrecognized an affirmative defense where the defendant\ncould show that the employee would have been dismissed\nregardless. The law permits the employer this defense,\nnot because the forbidden motive, age, had no role in the\nactual decision, but because the employer can show that\nhe would have dismissed the employee anyway in the\nhypothetical circumstance in which his age-related motive\nwas absent. And it makes sense that this would be an\naffirmative defense, rather than part of the showing of a\nviolation, precisely because the defendant is in a better\nposition than the plaintiff to establish how he would have\nacted in this hypothetical situation. See id., at 242; cf.\nante, at 6 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (describing the Title\nVII framework). I can see nothing unfair or impractical\n                Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nabout allocating the burdens of proof in this way.\n  The instruction that the District Court gave seems\nappropriate and lawful. It says, in pertinent part:\n      “Your verdict must be for plaintiff if all the follow\n   ing elements have been proved by the preponderance\n   of the evidence:\n        .           .          .            .          .\n   “[The] plaintiff’s age was a motivating factor in defen\n   dant’s decision to demote plaintiff.\n      “However, your verdict must be for defendant . . . if\n   it has been proved by the preponderance of the evi\n   dence that defendant would have demoted plaintiff\n   regardless of his age.\n        .           .          .            .          .\n      “As used in these instructions, plaintiff’s age was ‘a\n   motivating factor,’ if plaintiff’s age played a part or a\n   role in the defendant’s decision to demote plaintiff.\n   However, plaintiff’s age need not have been the only\n   reason for defendant’s decision to demote plaintiff.”\n   App. 9–10.\n  For these reasons as well as for those set forth by\nJUSTICE STEVENS, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145857/", "sha1": "f7a48c1e3b32fcf60eb5dbca111a079a550423aa", "source": "LC", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-074", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:36"}
