BAILEY ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08–295.      Argued March 30, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009*\nAs part of the 1986 reorganization plan of the Johns-Manville Corpora\n  tion (Manville), an asbestos supplier and manufacturer of asbestos\n  containing products, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement\n  providing that Manville’s insurers, including The Travelers Indem\n  nity Company and related companies (Travelers), would contribute to\n  the corpus of the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Trust),\n  and releasing those insurers from any “Policy Claims,” which were\n  channeled to the Trust. “Policy Claims” include, as relevant here,\n  “claims” and “allegations” against the insurers “based upon, arising\n  out of or relating to” the Manville insurance policies. The settlement\n  agreement and reorganization plan were approved by the Bankruptcy\n  Court (1986 Orders) and were affirmed by the District Court and the\n  Second Circuit. Over a decade later plaintiffs began filing asbestos\n  actions against Travelers in state courts (Direct Actions), often seek\n  ing to recover from Travelers not for Manville’s wrongdoing but for\n  Travelers’ own alleged violations of state consumer-protection stat\n  utes or of common law duties. Invoking the 1986 Orders, Travelers\n  asked the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin 26 Direct Actions. Ultimately,\n  a settlement was reached, in which Travelers agreed to make pay\n  ments to compensate the Direct Action claimants, contingent on the\n  court’s order clarifying that the Direct Actions were, and remained,\n  prohibited by the 1986 Orders. The court made extensive factual\n  findings, uncontested here, concluding that Travelers derived its\n  knowledge of asbestos from its insurance relationship with Manville\n  and that the Direct Actions are based on acts or omissions by Travel\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–307, Common Law Settlement Counsel v.

BAILEY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ers arising from or related to the insurance policies. It then approved\n    the settlement and entered an order (Clarifying Order), which pro\n    vided that the 1986 Orders barred the pending Direct Actions and\n    various other claims. Objectors to the settlement (respondents here)\n    appealed. The District Court affirmed, but the Second Circuit re\n    versed. Agreeing that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to in\n    terpret and enforce the 1986 Orders, the Circuit nevertheless held\n    that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the Direct Ac\n    tions because those actions sought not to recover based on Manville’s\n    conduct, but to recover directly from Travelers for its own conduct.\nHeld: The terms of the injunction bar the Direct Actions against Trav\n elers, and the finality of the Bankruptcy Court’s 1986 Orders gener\n ally stands in the way of challenging their enforceability. Pp. 9–18.\n    (a) The Direct Actions are “Policy Claims” enjoined as against\n Travelers by the 1986 Orders, which covered, inter alia, “claims” and\n “allegations” “relating to” Travelers’ insurance coverage of Manville.\n In a statute, “[t]he phrase ‘in relation to’ is expansive,” Smith v.\n United States, 508 U. S. 223, 237, and so is its reach here. While it\n would be possible to suggest that a “claim” only relates to Travelers’\n insurance coverage if it seeks recovery based upon Travelers’ specific\n contractual obligation to Manville, “allegations” is not amenable to\n such a narrow construction and clearly reaches factual assertions\n that relate in a more comprehensive way to Travelers’ dealings with\n Manville. The Bankruptcy Court’s detailed factual findings place the\n Direct Actions within the terms of the 1986 Orders. Contrary to re\n spondents’ argument, the 1986 Orders contain no language limiting\n “Policy Claims” to claims derivative of Manville’s liability. Even if,\n before the entry of the 1986 Orders, Travelers understood the pro\n posed injunction to bar only such derivative claims, where a court or\n der’s plain terms unambiguously apply, as they do here, they are en\n titled to their effect. If it is black-letter law that an unambiguous\n private contract’s terms must be enforced irrespective of the parties’\n subjective intent, it is also clear that a court, such as the Bankruptcy\n Court here, should enforce a court order, a public governmental act,\n according to its unambiguous terms. Pp. 10–13.\n    (b) Because the 1986 Orders became final on direct review over two\n decades ago, whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction and au\n thority to enter the injunction in 1986 was not properly before the\n Second Circuit in 2008 and is not properly before this Court. The\n Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its\n own prior orders, see Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 239, and\n it explicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce its injunctions when it is\n sued the 1986 Orders. The Second Circuit erred in holding the 1986\n Orders unenforceable according to their terms on the ground that the\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in 1986. On direct\n  appeal of the 1986 Orders, any objector was free to argue that the\n  Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, and the District\n  Court or Court of Appeals could have raised such concerns sua\n  sponte. But once those orders became final on direct review, they be\n  came res judicata to the “ ‘parties and those in privity with them.’ ”\n  Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S. 110, 130. So long as respondents\n  or those in privity with them were parties to Manville’s bankruptcy\n  proceeding, and were given a fair chance to challenge the Bankruptcy\n  Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, they cannot challenge it now by\n  resisting enforcement of the 1986 Orders. The Second Circuit’s will\n  ingness to entertain this collateral attack cannot be squared with res\n  judicata and the practical necessity served by that rule. Almost a\n  quarter-century after the 1986 Orders were entered, the time to\n  prune them is over. Pp. 13–16.\n    (c) This holding in narrow. The Court neither resolves whether a\n  bankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin claims\n  against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative of the debtor’s\n  wrongdoing, nor decides whether any particular respondent is bound\n  by the 1986 Orders, which is a question that the Second Circuit did\n  not consider.

The question is whether the injunc\ntion bars state-law actions against Travelers based on\nallegations either of its own wrongdoing while acting as\nManville’s insurer or of its misuse of information obtained\nfrom Manville as its insurer. We hold that the terms of\nthe injunction bar the actions and that the finality of the\nBankruptcy Court’s orders following the conclusion of\ndirect review generally stands in the way of challenging\n2           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe enforceability of the injunction.\n                                I\n   From the 1920s to the 1970s, Manville was, by most\naccounts, the largest supplier of raw asbestos and manu\nfacturer of asbestos-containing products in the United\nStates, In re Johns-Manville Corp., 517 F. 3d 52, 55–56\n(CA2 2008), and for much of that time Travelers was\nManville’s primary liability insurer. In re Johns-Manville\nCorp., No. 82 B 11656 etc. (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 2004), App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–295, pp. 111a–112a (hereinafter\nBkrtcy. Ct. Op.). As studies began to link asbestos expo\nsure to respiratory disease and thousands of lawsuits were\nfiled against Manville, Travelers, as the insurer, worked\nclosely with Manville to learn what its insured knew and\nto assess the dangers of asbestos exposure; it evaluated\nManville’s potential liability and defenses, and paid Man\nville’s litigation costs. Id., at 114a–117a, 121a–122a. In\n1982, the prospect of overwhelming liability led Manville\nto file for bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of\nNew York.\n   It thus became incumbent on the Bankruptcy Court to\ndevise “a plan of reorganization for [Manville] which\nwould provide for payment to holders of present or known\nasbestos health related claims . . . and [to] those persons\nwho had not yet manifested an injury but who would\nmanifest symptoms of asbestos-related illnesses at some\nfuture time.” In re Johns-Manville Corp., 97 B. R. 174,\n176 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1989). The ensuing reorganization\nplan created the Manville Personal Injury Settlement\nTrust (Trust) to pay all asbestos claims against Manville,\nwhich would be channeled to the Trust. See Kane v.\nJohns-Manville Corp., 843 F. 2d 636, 640–641 (CA2 1988);\nIn re Johns-Manville Corp., 340 B. R. 49, 54 (SDNY 2006).\nThe Trust has since paid out more than $3.2 billion to over\n600,000 claimants. Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 136a–137a.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the period leading up to the reorganization, Manville\nand its insurers litigated over the scope and limits of\nliability coverage, and Travelers faced suits by third par\nties, such as Manville factory workers and vendors of\nManville products, seeking compensation under the insur\nance policies. There was also litigation among the insur\ners themselves, who brought various indemnity claims,\ncontribution claims, and cross-claims. Id., at 132a–134a.\nIn a settlement described as the “cornerstone” of the Man\nville reorganization, the insurers agreed to provide most of\nthe initial corpus of the Trust, with a payment of $770\nmillion to the bankruptcy estate, $80 million of it from\nTravelers. MacArthur Co. v. Johns-Manville Corp., 837\nF. 2d 89, 90 (CA2 1988); Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 134a; In re Johns-\nManville Corp., 68 B. R. 618, 621 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY\n1986).\n   There would have been no such payment without the\ninjunction at the heart of the present dispute. The De\ncember 18, 1986, order of the Bankruptcy Court approving\nthe insurance settlement agreements (Insurance Settle\nment Order) provides that, upon the insurers’ payment of\nthe settlement funds to the Trust, “all Persons are perma\nnently restrained and enjoined from commencing and/or\ncontinuing any suit, arbitration or other proceeding of any\ntype or nature for Policy Claims against any or all mem\nbers of the Settling Insurer Group.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 08–295, at 446a. The Insurance Settlement Order\ngoes on to provide that the insurers are “released from any\nand all Policy Claims,” which are to be channeled to the\nTrust. Ibid. The order defines “Policy Claims” as “any\nand all claims, demands, allegations, duties, liabilities and\nobligations (whether or not presently known) which have\nbeen, or could have been, or might be, asserted by any\nPerson against . . . any or all members of the Settling\nInsurer Group based upon, arising out of or relating to any\nor all of the Policies.” Id., at 439a. The insurers were\n4            TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled “to terminate the settlements if the injunctive\norders [were] not issued or if they [were] set aside on\nappeal.” MacArthur, supra, at 90.\n  The Insurance Settlement Order was incorporated by\nreference in the Bankruptcy Court’s December 22, 1986,\norder confirming Manville’s Second Amended and Re\nstated Plan of Reorganization (Confirmation Order).1 App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–295, at 271a–272a. Both the\nConfirmation Order and the Insurance Settlement Order\n(collectively, 1986 Orders) were affirmed by the District\nCourt, see In re Johns-Manville Corp., 78 B. R. 407 (SDNY\n1987), and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see\nMacArthur, supra; Kane, supra.\n  Nonetheless, over a decade later plaintiffs started filing\nasbestos actions against Travelers in various state courts,\ncases that have been spoken of in this litigation as Direct\nActions. They are of two sorts. The Statutory Direct\nActions are brought under state consumer-protection\nstatutes, and allege that Travelers conspired with other\ninsurers and with asbestos manufacturers to hide the\ndangers of asbestos and to raise a fraudulent “state of the\nart” (or “no duty to warn”) defense to personal injury\nclaims. Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 140a–143a. The Common Law\nDirect Actions claim that Travelers violated common law\nduties by failing to warn the public about the dangers of\nasbestos or by acting to keep its knowledge of those dan\ngers from the public. Id., at 143a–147a. It is undisputed\nthat many of the plaintiffs seek to recover from Travelers,\nnot indirectly for Manville’s wrongdoing, but for Travelers’\nown alleged violations of state law. See 517 F. 3d, at 63.2\n——————\n  1 The Confirmation Order itself contains an additional injunction\n\nbarring certain claims against the settling insurance companies.\nBkrtcy. Ct. Op. 286a–288a. That injunction does not bear on our\ndecision, and we do not consider it.\n  2 A true “direct action” suit is “[a] lawsuit by a person claiming\n\nagainst an insured but suing the insurer directly instead of pursuing\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 2002, Travelers invoked the terms of the 1986 Orders\nin moving the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin 26 Direct Ac\ntions pending in state courts. Id., at 58. The court issued\na temporary restraining order, repeatedly extended, and\nreferred the parties to mediation, which led to settlements\nbetween Travelers and three sets of plaintiffs in both\nStatutory and Common Law Direct Actions. Bkrtcy. Ct.\nOp. 103a–104a. Under the settlement terms Travelers\nwould pay more than $400 million to settlement funds to\ncompensate Direct Action claimants, contingent upon the\nentry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court clarifying that\nthe Direct Actions were, and remained, prohibited by the\n1986 Orders. Id., at 150a–152a. The settlement requires\nclaimants seeking payment from the settlement funds to\ngrant Travelers a release from further liability, separate\nand apart from Travelers’ protection under the 1986 Or\nders. Id., at 151a–152a.\n   After notice of the settlement was given to potential\nclaimants, the Bankruptcy Court (the same judge who had\nissued the 1986 Orders) held an evidentiary hearing and\nmade extensive factual findings that are not challenged\nhere. The court determined that “Travelers[’] knowledge\nof the hazards of asbestos was derived from its nearly\nthree decade insurance relationship with Manville and the\nperformance by Travelers of its obligations under the\nPolicies, including through the underwriting, loss control\nactivities, defense obligations and generally through its\nlengthy and confidential insurance relationship under the\n——————\ncompensation indirectly through the insured.” Black’s Law Dictionary\n491 (8th ed. 2004). Because many of the suits at issue seek to hold\nTravelers liable for independent wrongdoing rather than for a legal\nwrong by Manville, they are not direct actions in the terms of strict\nusage. Nonetheless, because the suits are referred to as “direct actions”\nin the decisions of the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court, and the\nCourt of Appeals, we call them that as well, in the interest of simplicity.\nSee 517 F. 3d, at 55, n. 4.\n6           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npolicies.” Id., at 128a–129a. In sum, the Bankruptcy\nCourt found that “Travelers learned virtually everything it\nknew about asbestos from its relationship with Manville.”\nId., at 131a.\n    As for the Direct Actions, the court saw “[t]he gravamen\nof the Statutory Direct Action Lawsuits” as “center[ing] on\nTravelers[’] defense of Manville in asbestos-related\nclaims.” Id., at 142a. The court read the “alleged factual\npredicate” of the Common Law Direct Actions as being\n“essentially identical to the statutory actions: Travelers\n. . . influence[d] Manville’s purported failure to disclose\nknowledge about asbestos hazards; Travelers defended\nManville; Travelers advanced the state of the art defense;\nand Travelers coordinated Manville’s national defense\neffort.” Id., at 147a (citations omitted). The court under\nstood “the direct action claims against Travelers [to be]\ninextricably intertwined with Travelers[’] long relation\nship as Manville’s insurer,” id., at 169a, and found that\n“[a]fter the Court preliminarily enjoined prosecution of\nDirect Action Claims against Travelers pending final\nruling on the merits, certain plaintiffs’ lawyers violated\nthe letter and the spirit of this Court’s rulings by simply\ndeleting the term ‘Manville’ from their complaints—but\nleaving the substance unchanged,” id., at 147a.\n    Hence, the court’s conclusion that “[t]he evidence in this\nproceeding establishes that the gravamen of Direct Action\nClaims were acts or omissions by Travelers arising from or\nrelating to Travelers[’] insurance relationship with Man\nville.” Id., at 173a. Finding that the “claims against\nTravelers based on such actions or omissions necessarily\n‘arise out of’ and [are] ‘related to’ ” the insurance policies,\nibid., which compelled Travelers to defend Manville\nagainst asbestos-related claims, id., at 173a–176a, the\nBankruptcy Court held that the Direct Actions “are—and\nalways have been—permanently barred” by the 1986\nOrders, id., at 170a.\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)               7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n  The settlement was accordingly approved and an order\ndated August 17, 2004 (Clarifying Order), was entered,\nproviding that the 1986 Orders barred the pending Direct\nActions and “[t]he commencement or prosecution of all\nactions and proceedings against Travelers that directly or\nindirectly are based upon, arise out of or relate to Travel\ners[’] insurance relationship with Manville or Travelers[’]\nknowledge or alleged knowledge concerning the hazards of\nasbestos,” including claims for contribution or indemnifi\ncation. Id., at 95a. The Clarifying Order does not, how\never, block “the commencement and prosecution of claims\nagainst Travelers by policyholders other than Manville . . .\nfor insurance proceeds or other obligations arising under\nany policy of insurance provided by Travelers to a policy\nholder other than Manville.” Id., at 96a. The Clarifying\nOrder also separately disclaims that it enjoins bringing\n    “claims arising from contractual obligations by Trav\n    elers to policyholders other than Manville, as long as\n    Travelers[’] alleged liability or the proof required to\n    establish Travelers[’] alleged liability is unrelated to\n    any knowledge Travelers gained from its insurance\n    relationship with Manville or acts, errors, omissions\n    or evidence related to Travelers[’] insurance relation\n    ship with Manville.” Ibid.\n  Some individual claimants and Chubb Indemnity Insur\nance Company (Chubb), respondents before this Court,\nobjected to the settlement and subsequently appealed.3 So\nfar as it matters here, the District Court affirmed, but the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. In\npresenting the case to the Second Circuit the objectors\nargued that the Direct Actions fall outside the scope of the\n——————\n 3 Chubb   is a codefendant with Travelers in certain Common Law\nDirect Actions, and the Clarifying Order prevents it from bringing\ncontribution and indemnity claims against Travelers under certain\ncircumstances. See Brief for Respondent Chubb 16.\n8           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1986 Orders and that the Clarifying Order erroneously\nexpands those orders to bar actions beyond the Bank\nruptcy Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction and statutory\nauthority. Travelers and the settling claimants responded\nthat the Clarifying Order is consistent with the terms of\nthe 1986 Orders, that this reading of the 1986 Orders does\nnot generate any jurisdictional or other statutory con\ncerns, and that the Second Circuit’s prior rejection of a\nchallenge to the Insurance Settlement Order in MacAr­\nthur, 837 F. 2d 89, is controlling.\n   In its opinion explaining the judgment under review\nhere, the Second Circuit recognized that “[i]t is undisputed\nthat the bankruptcy court had continuing jurisdiction to\ninterpret and enforce its own 1986 orders,” and that “there\nis no doubt that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to\nclarify its prior orders.” 517 F. 3d, at 60–61. It also had\n“little doubt that, in a literal sense, the instant claims\nagainst Travelers ‘arise out of’ its provision of insurance\ncoverage to Manville,” id., at 67, and the court emphasized\nthat “[t]he bankruptcy court’s extensive factual findings\nregarding Manville’s all-encompassing presence in the\nasbestos industry and its extensive relationship with\nTravelers support this notion” that the subjects of the\nClarifying Order fall within the scope of the 1986 Orders,\nibid. The Circuit nevertheless held that the Bankruptcy\nCourt could not, in enforcing the 1986 Orders, “enjoin\nclaims over which it had no jurisdiction,” id., at 61, and\nthat “[t]he ancillary jurisdiction courts possess to enforce\ntheir own orders is itself limited by the jurisdictional\nlimits of the order sought to be enforced,” id., at 65, n. 22\n(internal quotation marks omitted). See also id., at 65\n(“The fact that our case involves a clarification of the\nbankruptcy court’s prior order does not alter the jurisdic\ntional predicate necessary to enjoin third-party non-debtor\nclaims”).\n   The Court of Appeals found that “the jurisdictional\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nanalysis by the lower courts falls short,” id., at 62, in\nfailing to recognize the significance of the fact that the\nDirect Actions “do not seek to collect on the basis of Man\nville’s conduct,” but rather “seek to recover directly from\nTravelers, a non-debtor insurer, for its own alleged mis\nconduct,” id., at 63. The Court of Appeals held that the\nBankruptcy Court mistook its jurisdiction when it en\njoined “claims brought against a third-party non-debtor\nsolely on the basis of that third-party’s financial contribu\ntion to a debtor’s estate,” because “a bankruptcy court only\nhas jurisdiction to enjoin third-party non-debtor claims\nthat directly affect the res of the bankruptcy estate.” Id.,\nat 66.\n   In reaching this result, the court explained that its prior\ndecision in MacArthur was not controlling, as there a\nManville asbestos distributor had challenged the authority\nof the Bankruptcy Court to bar it from collecting out of\nManville’s own insurance coverage. 517 F. 3d, at 62.\nHere, by contrast, “Travelers candidly admits that both\nthe statutory and common law claims seek damages from\nTravelers that are unrelated to the policy proceeds.” Id.,\nat 63. The Court of Appeals also considered the 1994\nenactment of 11 U. S. C. §524(g), which provides explicit\nstatutory authority for a bankruptcy court to order the\nchanneling of claims against a debtor’s insurers to the\nbankruptcy estate, but the court understood §524(g) to be\n“limited to situations where a third party has derivative\nliability for the claims against the debtor” and “was not\nintended to reach non-derivative claims.” 517 F. 3d, at 68\n(ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted).\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009) and now\nreverse.\n                             II\n  The Bankruptcy Court correctly understood that the\nDirect Actions fall within the scope of the 1986 Orders, as\n10          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuits of this sort always have. The Court of Appeals,\nhowever, believed it was free to look beyond the terms of\nthe 1986 Orders and so treated the action as one “con\ncern[ing] the outer reaches of a bankruptcy court’s juris\ndiction.” 517 F. 3d, at 55. This, we think, was error. If\nthis were a direct review of the 1986 Orders, the Court of\nAppeals would indeed have been duty bound to consider\nwhether the Bankruptcy Court had acted beyond its sub\nject-matter jurisdiction. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006); Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v.\nSwan, 111 U. S. 379, 382 (1884). But the 1986 Orders\nbecame final on direct review over two decades ago, and\nTravelers’ response to the Circuit’s jurisdictional ruling is\ncorrect: whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction\nand authority to enter the injunction in 1986 was not\nproperly before the Court of Appeals in 2008 and is not\nproperly before us.\n                               A\n   We begin at our point of agreement with the Second\nCircuit, that the Direct Actions are “Policy Claims” en\njoined as against Travelers by the language of the 1986\nOrders, which covered “claims, demands, allegations,\nduties, liabilities and obligations” against Travelers,\nknown or unknown at the time, “based upon, arising out of\nor relating to” Travelers’ insurance coverage of Manville.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–295, at 439a. In a statute,\n“[t]he phrase ‘in relation to’ is expansive,” Smith v. United\nStates, 508 U. S. 223, 237 (1993), and so is its reach here,\nwhere “Policy Claims” covers not only “claims,” but even\n“allegations” relating to the insurance coverage. Although\nit would be possible (albeit quite a stretch) to suggest that\na “claim” only relates to Travelers’ insurance coverage if it\nseeks recovery based upon Travelers’ specific contractual\nobligation to Manville, “allegations” is not even remotely\namenable to such a narrow construction and clearly\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreaches factual assertions that relate in a more compre\nhensive way to Travelers’ dealings with Manville.\n   The Bankruptcy Court’s uncontested factual findings\ndrive the point home. In substance, the Bankruptcy Court\nfound that the Direct Actions seek to recover against\nTravelers either for supposed wrongdoing in its capacity\nas Manville’s insurer or for improper use of information\nthat Travelers obtained from Manville as its insurer.\nThese actions so clearly involve “claims” (and, all the more\nso, “allegations”) “based upon, arising out of or relating to”\nTravelers’ insurance coverage of Manville, that we have no\nneed here to stake out the ultimate bounds of the injunc\ntion. There is, of course, a cutoff at some point, where the\nconnection between the insurer’s action complained of and\nthe insurance coverage would be thin to the point of ab\nsurd. See California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement\nv. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316, 335\n(1997) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“[A]pplying the ‘relate to’\nprovision according to its terms was a project doomed to\nfailure, since, as many a curbstone philosopher has ob\nserved, everything is related to everything else”); New\nYork State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans\nv. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655 (1995). But the\ndetailed findings of the Bankruptcy Court place the Direct\nActions within the terms of the 1986 Orders without\npushing the limits.\n   Respondents argue that this is just revisionism perpe\ntrated by the Clarifying Order, which they say improperly\nexpanded the scope of the 1986 Orders to enjoin the Direct\nActions. Their position appears to be that the 1986 Orders\nonly bar actions against insurers seeking to recover de\nrivatively for Manville’s wrongdoing, but not actions to\nrecover for Travelers’ own misconduct, no matter what its\nrelationship to Travelers’ coverage of Manville. But this\nsimply is not what the 1986 Orders say. The definition of\n“Policy Claims” contains nothing limiting it to derivative\n12          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nactions, and there is language in the 1986 Orders directly\nto the contrary: The 1986 Orders not only enjoin bringing\nexpansively defined “Policy Claims” against the settling\ninsurers, but they go on to provide that the injunction has\nno application to a claim previously brought against a\nsettling insurer “seeking any and all damages (other than\nor in addition to policy proceeds) for bad faith or other\ninsurer misconduct alleged in connection with the han\ndling or disposition of claims.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n08–295, at 446a. There is no doubt about the implication,\nthat this same sort of claim brought after the 1986 Orders\nbecome final will be barred. There would have been no\nneed for this exception if “Policy Claims” were limited to\nclaims against Travelers for Manville’s wrongdoing.\n   Respondents seek further refuge in evidence that before\nentry of the 1986 Orders some parties to the Manville\nbankruptcy (including Travelers) understood the proposed\ninjunction to bar only claims derivative of Manville’s\nliability. They may well be right about that: we are in no\nposition to engage in factfinding on this point, but there\ncertainly are statements in the record that seem to sup\nport respondents’ contention. See App. for Respondent\nChubb 1a–3a, 5a, 13a–14a. But be that as it may, where\nthe plain terms of a court order unambiguously apply, as\nthey do here, they are entitled to their effect. See, e.g.,\nNegrón-Almeda v. Santiago, 528 F. 3d 15, 23 (CA1 2008)\n(“[A] court must carry out and enforce an order that is\nclear and unambiguous on its face”); United States v.\nSpallone, 399 F. 3d 415, 421 (CA2 2005) (“[I]f a judgment\nis clear and unambiguous, a court must adopt, and give\neffect to, the plain meaning of the judgment” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). If it is black-letter law that\nthe terms of an unambiguous private contract must be\nenforced irrespective of the parties’ subjective intent, see\n11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:4 (4th ed. 1999), it\nis all the clearer that a court should enforce a court order,\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

The answer here is easy: as the Second Circuit\nrecognized, and respondents do not dispute, the Bank\nruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and\nenforce its own prior orders. See Local Loan Co. v. Hunt,\n292 U. S. 234, 239 (1934). What is more, when the Bank\nruptcy Court issued the 1986 Orders it explicitly retained\njurisdiction to enforce its injunctions. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 08–295, at 284a–286a.\n  The Court of Appeals, however, went on to a different\njurisdictional enquiry. It held that the 1986 Orders could\nnot be enforced according to their terms because, as the\npanel saw it, the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its\njurisdiction when it issued the orders in 1986. We think,\nthough, that it was error for the Court of Appeals to re\nevaluate the Bankruptcy Court’s exercise of jurisdiction in\n——————\n   4 Even if we found the 1986 Orders to be ambiguous as applied to the\n\nDirect Actions, and even if we concluded that it would be proper to look\nto the parties’ communications to resolve that ambiguity, it is far from\nclear that respondents would be entitled to upset the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s interpretation of the 1986 Orders. Numerous Courts of Appeals\nhave held that a bankruptcy court’s interpretation of its own confirma\ntion order is entitled to substantial deference. See In re Shenango\nGroup Inc., 501 F. 3d 338, 346 (CA3 2007); In re Dow Corning Corp.,\n456 F. 3d 668, 675 (CA6 2006); In re Optical Technologies, Inc., 425\nF. 3d 1294, 1300 (CA11 2005); In re Dial Business Forms, Inc., 341\nF. 3d 738, 744 (CA8 2003); In re National Gypsum Co., 219 F. 3d 478,\n484 (CA5 2000); In re Casse, 198 F. 3d 327, 333 (CA2 1999); In re\nTomlin, 105 F. 3d 933, 941 (CA4 1997); Monarch Life Ins.

Because the 1986 Orders clearly cover the Direct Actions,\nwe need not determine the proper standard of review.\n14            TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1986.\n   On direct appeal of the 1986 Orders, anyone who ob\njected was free to argue that the Bankruptcy Court had\nexceeded its jurisdiction, and the District Court or Court\nof Appeals could have raised such concerns sua sponte. In\nfact, one objector argued just that. In MacArthur, a dis\ntributor of Manville asbestos claimed to be a coinsured\nunder certain Manville insurance policies and argued that\nthe 1986 Orders exceeded the Bankruptcy Court’s jurisdic\ntion by preventing the distributor from recovering under\nthe policies; the Second Circuit disagreed, concluding that\nthe Bankruptcy Court had not stepped outside its jurisdic\ntion or statutory authority.5 See 837 F. 2d, at 91–94. But\nonce the 1986 Orders became final on direct review\n(whether or not proper exercises of bankruptcy court\njurisdiction and power), they became res judicata to the\n“ ‘parties and those in privity with them, not only as to\nevery matter which was offered and received to sustain or\ndefeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible\nmatter which might have been offered for that purpose.’ ”\nNevada v. United States, 463 U. S. 110, 130 (1983) (quot\ning Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351, 352 (1877)).\n   Those orders are not any the less preclusive because the\nattack is on the Bankruptcy Court’s conformity with its\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, for “[e]ven subject-matter\njurisdiction . . . may not be attacked collaterally.” Kon­\n——————\n  5 We  agree with the Court of Appeals that MacArthur only resolved\nthe narrow question whether the Bankruptcy Court could enjoin\nderivative claims against the insurers and did not address whether the\n1986 Orders, in their entirety, were proper. We note MacArthur merely\nto illustrate the obvious: the 1986 Orders were subject to challenge, on\njurisdictional grounds or otherwise, on direct review. The dissent\nsuggests that MacArthur limited the scope of the 1986 Orders to\nderivative claims, see post, at 1, 7–9, but it did not. The question\nwhether the Bankruptcy Court had enjoined or could properly enjoin\nnonderivative claims was not at issue in MacArthur and the court did\nnot answer it.\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 455, n. 9 (2004). See also\nChicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, 308\nU.

Their determina\ntions of such questions, while open to direct review, may\nnot be assailed collaterally”). So long as respondents or\nthose in privity with them were parties to the Manville\nbankruptcy proceeding, and were given a fair chance to\nchallenge the Bankruptcy Court’s subject-matter jurisdic\ntion, they cannot challenge it now by resisting enforce\nment of the 1986 Orders. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland\nv. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U. S. 694, 702,\nn. 9 (1982) (“A party that has had an opportunity to liti\ngate the question of subject-matter jurisdiction may not\n. . . reopen that question in a collateral attack upon an\nadverse judgment”); Chicot County, supra, at 375 (“[T]hese\nbondholders, having the opportunity to raise the question\nof invalidity, were not the less bound by the decree be\ncause they failed to raise it”).6\n——————\n  6 The  rule is not absolute, and we have recognized rare situations in\nwhich subject-matter jurisdiction is subject to collateral attack. See,\ne.g., United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S.\n506, 514 (1940) (a collateral attack on subject-matter jurisdiction is\npermissible “where the issue is the waiver of [sovereign] immunity”);\nKalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U. S. 433, 439–440, 444 (1940) (where debtor’s\npetition for relief was pending in bankruptcy court and federal statute\naffirmatively divested other courts of jurisdiction to continue foreclo\nsure proceedings, state-court foreclosure judgment was subject to\ncollateral attack). More broadly, the Restatement (Second) of Judg\nments §12, p. 115 (1980), describes three exceptional circumstances in\nwhich a collateral attack on subject-matter jurisdiction is permitted:\n   “(1) The subject matter of the action was so plainly beyond the court’s\njurisdiction that its entertaining the action was a manifest abuse of\n16            TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The willingness of the Court of Appeals to entertain this\nsort of collateral attack cannot be squared with res judi\ncata and the practical necessity served by that rule. “It is\njust as important that there should be a place to end as\nthat there should be a place to begin litigation,” Stoll v.\nGottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172 (1938), and the need for final\nity forbids a court called upon to enforce a final order to\n“tunnel back . . . for the purpose of reassessing prior juris\ndiction de novo,” In re Optical Technologies, Inc., 425 F. 3d\n1294, 1308 (CA11 2005). If the law were otherwise, and\n“courts could evaluate the jurisdiction that they may or\nmay not have had to issue a final judgment, the rules of\nres judicata . . . would be entirely short-circuited.” Id., at\n1307; see Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503 U. S. 131, 137 (1992)\n(“[T]he practical concern with providing an end to litiga\ntion justifies a rule preventing collateral attack on subject\nmatter jurisdiction”). Almost a quarter-century after the\n1986 Orders were entered, the time to prune them is over.7\n——————\nauthority; or\n  “(2) Allowing the judgment to stand would substantially infringe the\nauthority of another tribunal or agency of government; or\n  “(3) The judgment was rendered by a court lacking capability to make\nan adequately informed determination of a question concerning its own\njurisdiction and as a matter of procedural fairness the party seeking to\navoid the judgment should have opportunity belatedly to attack the\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction.”\nThis is no occasion to address whether we adopt all of these exceptions.\nRespondents do not claim any of them, and we do not see how any\nwould apply here. This is not a situation, for example, in which a\nbankruptcy court decided to conduct a criminal trial, or to resolve a\ncustody dispute, matters “so plainly beyond the court’s jurisdiction”\nthat a different result might be called for.\n  7 Respondents point out that it is Travelers, not they, who moved the\n\nBankruptcy Court to enforce the 1986 Orders. But who began the\npresent proceedings has no bearing on the application of res judicata; to\nthe extent respondents argue that the 1986 Orders should not be\nenforced according to their terms because of a jurisdictional flaw in\n1986, this argument is an impermissible collateral attack. And to the\nextent respondents disclaim any initial intent to mount such an attack,\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

We do not resolve whether a\nbankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin\nclaims against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative\nof the debtor’s wrongdoing. As the Court of Appeals noted,\nin 1994 Congress explicitly authorized bankruptcy courts,\nin some circumstances, to enjoin actions against a non\ndebtor “alleged to be directly or indirectly liable for the\nconduct of, claims against, or demands on the debtor to the\nextent such alleged liability . . . arises by reason of . . . the\nthird party’s provision of insurance to the debtor or a\nrelated party,” and to channel those claims to a trust for\npayments to asbestos claimants.             11 U. S. C. §524\n(g)(4)(A)(ii). On direct review today, a channeling injunc\ntion of the sort issued by the Bankruptcy Court in 1986\nwould have to be measured against the requirements of\n§524 (to begin with, at least). But owing to the posture of\nthis litigation, we do not address the scope of an injunction\nauthorized by that section.8\n   Nor do we decide whether any particular respondent is\nbound by the 1986 Orders. We have assumed that re\nspondents are bound, but the Court of Appeals did not\nconsider this question. Chubb, in fact, relying on Amchem\nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591 (1997), and Ortiz\nv. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815 (1999), has maintained\nthat it was not given constitutionally sufficient notice of\nthe 1986 Orders, so that due process absolves it from\nfollowing them, whatever their scope. See 340 B. R., at 68.\nThe District Court rejected this argument, id., at 68–69,\nbut the Court of Appeals did not reach it, 517 F. 3d, at 60,\n\n——————\nthis too is irrelevant, since the decision of the Court of Appeals is what\nwe review and find at odds with finality.\n  8 Section 524(h) provides that under some circumstances §524(g) op\n\nerates retroactively to validate an injunction.

I disagree. In my view, the injunction bars\nonly those claims against Manville’s insurers seeking to\nrecover from the bankruptcy estate for Manville’s miscon\nduct, not those claims seeking to recover against the in\nsurers for their own misconduct. This interpretation\nrespects the limits of the Bankruptcy Court’s power; it is\nconsistent with the Court of Appeals’ understanding when\nit upheld the 1986 injunction on direct review and with\nCongress’ codification of the Manville bankruptcy ap\nproach for future asbestos proceedings in 11 U. S. C.\n§524(g); and it makes sense of Travelers’ payment of $445\n2          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmillion in 2004 in exchange for a Bankruptcy Court order\nthat supposedly “clarified” an unambiguous injunction.\n  Because the 1986 injunction has never meant what the\nCourt today assumes, respondents’ challenge is not an\nimpermissible collateral attack. The Court of Appeals\ncorrectly concluded that the Bankruptcy Court’s 2004\norder improperly enjoined the state-law claims at issue in\nthis proceeding.\n                               I\n   At the heart of the dispute in this litigation is the dis\ntinction between two types of lawsuits seeking recovery\nfrom Manville’s primary insurer, The Travelers Indemnity\nCompany, and its affiliates (together, Travelers). The first\nclass, which I shall call “insurer actions,” comprises suits\nin which the plaintiff is asserting that Travelers, as an\ninsurer of Manville, has a duty to satisfy the plaintiff’s\nclaim against Manville. Plaintiffs in that class include not\nonly members of the public exposed to asbestos but also\nManville factory workers and vendors of Manville prod\nucts. The second class, which I shall call “independent\nactions,” comprises suits in which the plaintiff is asserting\nthat Travelers is liable for its own misconduct. The plain\ntiffs in these suits have alleged both violations of state\nconsumer-protection laws and breaches of common-law\nduties. See ante, at 4.\n   Suits that are called “direct actions” in the proceedings\nbelow and in the Court’s opinion may fall in either cate\ngory, but as the Court acknowledges the “true” definition\nof that term describes only insurer actions. Ante, at 4–5,\nn. 2; see Black’s Law Dictionary 491 (8th ed. 2004). True\ndirect actions are lawsuits in which a plaintiff claims that\nshe was injured by Manville and seeks recovery directly\nfrom its insurer without first obtaining a judgment\nagainst Manville. The global settlement that made the\n1986 reorganization of Manville possible clearly encom\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npassed all such direct actions; Manville’s insurers paid\n$770 million, including $80 million from Travelers, into\nthe Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Manville\nTrust) to which these actions would be channeled. But\nmany of the claims that gave rise to the instant litigation\nallege no breach of duty by Manville and seek no recovery\nfrom the Manville Trust. See ante, at 4–5, n. 2. They are\nclaims against Travelers based on its own alleged viola\ntions of state statutes and common-law rules. Thus, even\nthough the Court calls these claims “direct actions,” they\nare nothing of the sort. They are independent actions.\n   Some of the independent actions are based on facts\nconcerning Travelers’ insurance relationship with Man\nville. A number of suits, for example, allege that Travel\ners acquired information about asbestos-related hazards\nfrom Manville that it had a duty to disclose to third par\nties.1 This sort of factual nexus does not, however, trans\nform an independent action into an insurer action. In\nstead, the question remains whether a suit seeks to\nrecover from Travelers for Manville’s wrongdoing or in\nstead seeks to recover from Travelers for its own wrongdo\ning, making no claim on Manville’s insurance policy pro\nceeds or other assets of the Manville bankruptcy estate.\n   Recognizing the distinction between insurer actions and\nindependent actions, the Court of Appeals held that the\nBankruptcy Court had improperly enjoined the latter in\nits 2004 order.2 Without ruling on the extent of the Bank\nruptcy Court’s power, see ante, at 17, the Court today\n——————\n  1 The theories asserted in many of the state-law actions are novel,\nand, as the Court of Appeals noted, these claims “have met with almost\nuniversal failure in the state courts.” In re Johns-Manville Corp., 517\nF. 3d 52, 68 (CA2 2008).\n  2 The Court of Appeals noted that the Bankruptcy Court had not con\n\nsidered whether the various actions at issue were properly classified as\ninsurer actions or independent actions, and it remanded for the Bank\nruptcy Court to undertake this assessment.\n4             TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nconcludes that the 1986 injunction unambiguously barred\nindependent actions and that the Bankruptcy Court’s 2004\norder simply clarified, and did not enlarge, the scope of\nthat injunction. Based on that premise, the Court holds\nthat respondents are challenging the Bankruptcy Court’s\nauthority to have issued the injunction in 1986, and it\ndeems the challenge an impermissible collateral attack. I\ndisagree with both the Court’s understanding of the 1986\ninjunction and its attendant res judicata analysis.\n                             II\n  The 1986 order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the\ninsurance settlement agreements (Insurance Settlement\nOrder), which was incorporated by reference in the order\nconfirming Manville’s plan of reorganization, includes\nthree related protections for Manville’s insurers, each\nfocused on the company’s insurance policies. It releases\nthe insurers from all “Policy Claims,” channels these\nclaims to the Manville Trust, and permanently enjoins all\npersons from commencing or continuing a proceeding for\n“Policy Claims” against a settling insurer. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 445a–446a. The Insurance Settlement Order defines\n“Policy Claims” as:\n       “any and all claims, demands, allegations, duties, li\n       abilities and obligations (whether or not presently\n       known) which have been, or could have been, or might\n       be, asserted by any Person against any or all members\n       of the [Manville] Group or against any or all members\n       of the Settling Insurer Group based upon, arising out\n       of or relating to any or all of the Policies.” Id., at 439a\n       (emphasis added).3\n\n——————\n    3 As\n       the Court notes, the order confirming Manville’s reorganization\nplan contains an additional injunction barring claims against the\nsettling insurance companies. Ante, at 4, n. 1. The language in that\norder enjoins only insurer actions. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 286a–288a\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

Thus,\nit concludes that “the plain terms of [the] court order\nunambiguously” bar independent actions. Ante, at 12.\n   The Court doth protest too much. Indeed, despite its\ninsistence that the definition of “Policy Claims” is unam\nbiguous, the Court quickly concludes that it cannot apply\nthe “based upon, arising out of or relating to” language\nliterally because there is a “cutoff at some point, where the\nconnection between the insurer’s action complained of and\nthe insurance coverage would be thin to the point of ab\nsurd.” Ante, at 11. Presumably, for instance, the Court\nwould not deem enjoined a state-law claim for personal\ninjuries caused by a Travelers’ agent’s reckless driving\nwhile en route to the courthouse to defend Manville even\nthough, in a literal sense, this suit relates to (perhaps\neven arises out of) Travelers’ performance of its policy\nobligations to Manville. The Court determines that it\nneed not “stake out the ultimate bounds of the injunction”\nbecause it can rely on the Bankruptcy Court’s “uncon\ntested factual findings” that the particular independent\nactions at issue fall within the category that it had in\ntended to enjoin. Ibid.\n   If the definition of the term “Policy Claims” is not ame\nnable to a purely literal construction and the Court must\nlook beyond the four corners of the Insurance Settlement\n—————— \n\n(enjoining actions against settling insurance companies seeking,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, to recover on or with respect to a “Claim, Interest,\n\nor Other Asbestos Obligation”); id., at 56a, n. 6 (defining “Other Asbes\n\ntos Obligation” as an obligation arising directly or indirectly from acts\n\nor omissions of a debtor). The parties accordingly focus on whether the \n\nInsurance Settlement Agreement enjoins independent actions. \n\n6           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nOrder to ascertain its meaning, however, the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s factual findings in 2004 are not the best guide. I\nwould instead construe the order with reference to the\nlimits of the Bankruptcy Court’s authority—limits that\nwere well understood by the insurers during the original\nsettlement negotiations—and with reference to the Court\nof Appeals’ interpretation of the Insurance Settlement\nOrder when it upheld it against a jurisdictional challenge\nin 1988.\n   We should not lightly assume that the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order that exceeded its authority. When\na bankruptcy proceeding is commenced, the bankruptcy\ncourt acquires control of the debtor’s assets and the power\nto discharge its debts. A bankruptcy court has no author\nity, however, to adjudicate, settle, or enjoin claims against\nnondebtors that do not affect the debtor’s estate. Because\nTravelers’ insurance policies were a significant asset of the\nManville bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy Court had\nthe power to channel claims to the insurance proceeds to\nthe Manville Trust. But this by no means gave it the\npower to enjoin claims against nondebtors like Travelers\nthat had no impact on the bankruptcy estate. Thus, even\naccepting the Bankruptcy Court’s representation in 2004\nthat it had “meant to provide the broadest protection\npossible” to the settling insurers, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n172a, such relief could not include protection from inde\npendent actions.\n   That the Bankruptcy Court was without authority to\nenjoin independent actions was well understood by both\nManville and Travelers during their settlement negotia\ntions. In Manville’s memorandum in support of the Insur\nance Settlement Agreement, it clarified that it did “not\nseek to have [the Bankruptcy] Court release its Settling\nInsurers from claims by third parties based on the In\nsurer’s own tortious misconduct towards the third party”\nbut rather sought only to release the insurers “from the\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

This understanding reflected\nnot only the basic fact that the settlement was between\nManville and its insurers (and not third parties), but also\nthe parties’ knowledge that the “Second Circuit [had held]\nthat the bankruptcy courts lack power to discharge ‘inde\npendent’ claims of third parties against nondebtors.” Id.,\nat 5a–6a.\n   Travelers similarly acknowledged the limits of the\nBankruptcy Court’s power. Noting that “[t]he court has in\nrem jurisdiction over the Policies and thus the power to\nenter appropriate orders to protect that jurisdiction,” it\nstated that “the injunction is intended only to restrain\nclaims against the res (i.e., the Policies) which are or may\nbe asserted, against the Settling Insurers.” Id., at 13a–\n14a;4 see also id., at 10a (memorandum of the legal repre\nsentative of the Bankruptcy Court noting that “[a]ll par\nties seem to agree that any injunction, channeling order\nand release is limited to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\nres”). In short, it was apparent to the settling parties, and\nno doubt also to the Bankruptcy Court, that the court\nlacked the power to enjoin third-party claims against\nnondebtors that did not affect the debtor’s estate.\n   When the Court of Appeals upheld the injunction bar\nring the assertion of “Policy Claims” against Manville’s\ninsurers it, too, understood these limits of the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s authority. MacArthur Corporation, a Manville\nasbestos distributor, claimed to be a coinsured under\nManville’s insurance policies by virtue of “vendor en\n\n——————\n  4 This statement of Travelers’ intent belies the Bankruptcy Court’s\nsuggestion that enjoining independent actions was a necessary condi\ntion of Travelers’ contribution to the Manville estate. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 170a–173a.\n8           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndorsements” in those policies entitling distributors to\ninsurance coverage for claims arising from their sale of\nManville products. MacArthur argued that the Bank\nruptcy Court lacked authority to issue the Insurance\nSettlement Order, which prevented it from suing the\ninsurers, because this order constituted a de facto dis\ncharge in bankruptcy of nondebtor parties not entitled to\nChapter 11 protection. In rejecting MacArthur’s argu\nment, the Court of Appeals did not hold that the Bank\nruptcy Court possessed the authority to enjoin all actions\nagainst the insurers bearing some factual connection to\nManville. Rather, it held that MacArthur had miscon\nstrued the scope of the Bankruptcy Court’s order, which\nprecluded “only those suits against the settling insurers\nthat arise out of or relate to Manville’s insurance policies.”\nMacArthur Co. v. Johns-Manville Corp., 837 F. 2d 89, 91\n(CA2 1988).\n   The Court of Appeals reasoned that this language en\njoined MacArthur’s claims because “MacArthur’s rights as\nan insured vendor are completely derivative of Manville’s\nrights as the primary insured.” Id., at 92. Just as asbes\ntos victims were “barred from asserting direct actions\nagainst the insurers,” so too was MacArthur barred be\ncause “in both instances, third parties seek to collect out of\nthe proceeds of Manville’s insurance policies on the basis of\nManville’s conduct.” Id., at 92–93 (emphasis added). The\nCourt of Appeals further held that, because Manville’s\npolicies were property of the bankruptcy estate, the Bank\nruptcy Court had “properly issued the orders pursuant to\nits equitable and statutory powers to dispose of the\ndebtor’s property free and clear of third-party interests\nand to channel those interests to the proceeds thereby\ncreated.” Id., at 91.\n   As the Court of Appeals recognized in the instant pro\nceedings, its earlier interpretation of the Insurance Set\ntlement Order in MacArthur did not and does not extend\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nto the independent actions at issue in the instant suit:\n“Travelers candidly admits that both the statutory and\ncommon law claims seek damages from Travelers that are\nunrelated to the policy proceeds, quite unlike the claims in\nMacArthur . . . where plaintiffs sought indemnification or\ncompensation for the tortious wrongs of Manville to be\npaid out of the proceeds of Manville’s insurance policies.”\nIn re Johns-Manville Corp., 517 F. 3d 52, 63 (CA2 2008).\nAlso in contrast to MacArthur, “the claims at issue here do\nnot seek to collect on the basis of Manville’s conduct. . . .\nInstead, the Plaintiffs seek to recover directly from Trav\nelers, a non-debtor insurer, for its own alleged miscon\nduct.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the 1986 Insur\nance Settlement Order as enjoining only insurer actions\nand not independent actions is further supported by a\nstatutory provision patterned after the Manville settle\nment. In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Congress\nadopted 11 U. S. C. §524(g) to expressly authorize the\napproach of the Manville bankruptcy in future asbestos\nrelated bankruptcies. In granting bankruptcy courts the\npower to provide injunctive relief to nondebtors, Congress\nstated that courts may bar an action directed against a\nthird party who “is alleged to be directly or indirectly\nliable for the conduct of, claims against, or demands on the\ndebtor to the extent such alleged liability of such third\nparty arises by reason of . . . the third party’s provision of\ninsurance to the debtor or a related party.”\n§524(g)(4)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). As the italicized lan\nguage makes clear, the statute permits a bankruptcy court\nto enjoin actions seeking to proceed against a nondebtor\ninsurer for a debtor’s wrongdoing, but it does not confer\npower to enjoin independent actions arising out of the\ninsurer’s own wrongdoing. See generally In re Combustion\nEngineering, Inc., 391 F. 3d 190, 235, n. 47 (CA3 2004)\n(explaining that §524(g), like the Manville injunction, is\n10          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlimited to insurer actions). Had Congress interpreted\n“Policy Claims” in the manner the Court does today, and\nhad it sought to codify that definition, it would have used\nbroader language.\n  Finally, it is worth asking why Travelers paid more\nthan $400 million in 2004 to three new settlement funds\nin exchange for the Bankruptcy Court’s order “clarifying”\nthat the independent actions “are—and always have\nbeen—permanently barred” by the 1986 injunction. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 170a. If the 1986 injunction were as clear\nas the Court assumes, surely Travelers would not have\npaid $445 million—more than five times the amount of its\ninitial contribution to the Manville Trust—to obtain a\nredundant piece of paper.\n  In sum, I believe the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order\ndid not enjoin independent actions of the sort giving rise to\nthese proceedings. A contrary conclusion ignores the\nlimits of the Bankruptcy Court’s authority, the Court of\nAppeals’ interpretation of the order upheld on direct re\nview in 1988, Congress’ approval of the Manville reorgani\nzation, and Travelers’ own conduct during both the 1986\nand 2004 settlement negotiations.\n                            III\n  The Court’s holding that respondents’ challenge is an\nimpermissible collateral attack is predicated on its deter\nmination that the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order\nplainly enjoined their independent actions. See ante, at\n13–14. Because I disagree with this premise, I also dis\nagree with the Court’s preclusion analysis. In challenging\nthe Bankruptcy Court’s 2004 order “clarifying” the scope of\nthe Insurance Settlement Order, respondents were in fact\ntimely appealing an order that rewrote the scope of the\n1986 injunctions. Their objection could not have been\nraised on direct appeal of the 1986 order because it was\nnot an objection to anything in that order. And, of course,\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court of Appeals did not rule on a challenge to the\nenjoining of independent actions during direct review, as\nthe Court acknowledges. See ante, at 14, n. 5. To the\ncontrary, it interpreted the 1986 order as reaching only\ninsurer actions. Thus, there neither was nor reasonably\ncould have been a prior challenge that the 1986 order\nimpermissibly enjoined independent actions.\n   Because the Court regards respondents’ challenge as a\ncollateral attack, it brushes aside their jurisdictional\nobjection to the Bankruptcy Court’s 2004 order on the\nground that “the Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdic\ntion to interpret and enforce its own prior orders.” Ante,\nat 13. But neither respondents nor the Court of Appeals\ncontested that point. Rather, respondents argued that the\nBankruptcy Court was not merely interpreting and enforc\ning its prior orders and that it had no jurisdiction to enjoin\nthe independent actions when it approved the 2004 set\ntlements. The Court of Appeals accordingly examined\nwhether the 2004 order improperly expanded the scope of\nthe 1986 injunction and concluded that it did, thereby\nenjoining claims that were beyond the Bankruptcy Court’s\npower to enjoin.\n   In my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was\ncorrect. The 1986 Insurance Settlement Order did not bar\nindependent actions, and the Bankruptcy Court lacked\nany basis for enjoining those actions in 2004. The inde\npendent actions have no effect on the bankruptcy estate,\nand “bankruptcy courts have no jurisdiction over proceed\nings that have no effect on the debtor.” Celotex Corp. v.\nEdwards, 514 U. S. 300, 309, n. 6 (1995). The Court of\nAppeals thus correctly concluded that the Bankruptcy\nCourt had impermissibly enjoined “claims against Travel\ners that were predicated, as a matter of state law, on\nTravelers’ own alleged misconduct and were unrelated to\nManville’s insurance policy proceeds and the res of the\nManville estate.” 517 F. 3d, at 68.\n12        TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v.

Argued March 30, 2009—Decided June 18, 2009*\nAs part of the 1986 reorganization plan of the Johns-Manville Corpora\n  tion (Manville), an asbestos supplier and manufacturer of asbestos\n  containing products, the Bankruptcy Court approved a settlement\n  providing that Manville’s insurers, including The Travelers Indem\n  nity Company and related companies (Travelers), would contribute to\n  the corpus of the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Trust),\n  and releasing those insurers from any “Policy Claims,” which were\n  channeled to the Trust. “Policy Claims” include, as relevant here,\n  “claims” and “allegations” against the insurers “based upon, arising\n  out of or relating to” the Manville insurance policies. The settlement\n  agreement and reorganization plan were approved by the Bankruptcy\n  Court (1986 Orders) and were affirmed by the District Court and the\n  Second Circuit. Over a decade later plaintiffs began filing asbestos\n  actions against Travelers in state courts (Direct Actions), often seek\n  ing to recover from Travelers not for Manville’s wrongdoing but for\n  Travelers’ own alleged violations of state consumer-protection stat\n  utes or of common law duties. Invoking the 1986 Orders, Travelers\n  asked the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin 26 Direct Actions. Ultimately,\n  a settlement was reached, in which Travelers agreed to make pay\n  ments to compensate the Direct Action claimants, contingent on the\n  court’s order clarifying that the Direct Actions were, and remained,\n  prohibited by the 1986 Orders. The court made extensive factual\n  findings, uncontested here, concluding that Travelers derived its\n  knowledge of asbestos from its insurance relationship with Manville\n  and that the Direct Actions are based on acts or omissions by Travel\n——————\n  * Together with No. 08–307, Common Law Settlement Counsel v. Bai\nley et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n2               TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v.

It then approved\n    the settlement and entered an order (Clarifying Order), which pro\n    vided that the 1986 Orders barred the pending Direct Actions and\n    various other claims. Objectors to the settlement (respondents here)\n    appealed. The District Court affirmed, but the Second Circuit re\n    versed. Agreeing that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to in\n    terpret and enforce the 1986 Orders, the Circuit nevertheless held\n    that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the Direct Ac\n    tions because those actions sought not to recover based on Manville’s\n    conduct, but to recover directly from Travelers for its own conduct.\nHeld: The terms of the injunction bar the Direct Actions against Trav\n elers, and the finality of the Bankruptcy Court’s 1986 Orders gener\n ally stands in the way of challenging their enforceability. Pp. 9–18.\n    (a) The Direct Actions are “Policy Claims” enjoined as against\n Travelers by the 1986 Orders, which covered, inter alia, “claims” and\n “allegations” “relating to” Travelers’ insurance coverage of Manville.\n In a statute, “[t]he phrase ‘in relation to’ is expansive,” Smith v.\n United States, 508 U. S. 223, 237, and so is its reach here. While it\n would be possible to suggest that a “claim” only relates to Travelers’\n insurance coverage if it seeks recovery based upon Travelers’ specific\n contractual obligation to Manville, “allegations” is not amenable to\n such a narrow construction and clearly reaches factual assertions\n that relate in a more comprehensive way to Travelers’ dealings with\n Manville. The Bankruptcy Court’s detailed factual findings place the\n Direct Actions within the terms of the 1986 Orders. Contrary to re\n spondents’ argument, the 1986 Orders contain no language limiting\n “Policy Claims” to claims derivative of Manville’s liability. Even if,\n before the entry of the 1986 Orders, Travelers understood the pro\n posed injunction to bar only such derivative claims, where a court or\n der’s plain terms unambiguously apply, as they do here, they are en\n titled to their effect. If it is black-letter law that an unambiguous\n private contract’s terms must be enforced irrespective of the parties’\n subjective intent, it is also clear that a court, such as the Bankruptcy\n Court here, should enforce a court order, a public governmental act,\n according to its unambiguous terms. Pp. 10–13.\n    (b) Because the 1986 Orders became final on direct review over two\n decades ago, whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction and au\n thority to enter the injunction in 1986 was not properly before the\n Second Circuit in 2008 and is not properly before this Court. The\n Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and enforce its\n own prior orders, see Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 239, and\n it explicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce its injunctions when it is\n sued the 1986 Orders. The Second Circuit erred in holding the 1986\n Orders unenforceable according to their terms on the ground that the\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in 1986. On direct\n  appeal of the 1986 Orders, any objector was free to argue that the\n  Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, and the District\n  Court or Court of Appeals could have raised such concerns sua\n  sponte. But once those orders became final on direct review, they be\n  came res judicata to the “ ‘parties and those in privity with them.’ ”\n  Nevada v. United States, 463 U. S. 110, 130. So long as respondents\n  or those in privity with them were parties to Manville’s bankruptcy\n  proceeding, and were given a fair chance to challenge the Bankruptcy\n  Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, they cannot challenge it now by\n  resisting enforcement of the 1986 Orders. The Second Circuit’s will\n  ingness to entertain this collateral attack cannot be squared with res\n  judicata and the practical necessity served by that rule. Almost a\n  quarter-century after the 1986 Orders were entered, the time to\n  prune them is over. Pp. 13–16.\n    (c) This holding in narrow. The Court neither resolves whether a\n  bankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin claims\n  against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative of the debtor’s\n  wrongdoing, nor decides whether any particular respondent is bound\n  by the 1986 Orders, which is a question that the Second Circuit did\n  not consider.

The question is whether the injunc\ntion bars state-law actions against Travelers based on\nallegations either of its own wrongdoing while acting as\nManville’s insurer or of its misuse of information obtained\nfrom Manville as its insurer. We hold that the terms of\nthe injunction bar the actions and that the finality of the\nBankruptcy Court’s orders following the conclusion of\ndirect review generally stands in the way of challenging\n2           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe enforceability of the injunction.\n                                I\n   From the 1920s to the 1970s, Manville was, by most\naccounts, the largest supplier of raw asbestos and manu\nfacturer of asbestos-containing products in the United\nStates, In re Johns-Manville Corp., 517 F. 3d 52, 55–56\n(CA2 2008), and for much of that time Travelers was\nManville’s primary liability insurer. In re Johns-Manville\nCorp., No. 82 B 11656 etc. (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 2004), App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–295, pp. 111a–112a (hereinafter\nBkrtcy. Ct. Op.). As studies began to link asbestos expo\nsure to respiratory disease and thousands of lawsuits were\nfiled against Manville, Travelers, as the insurer, worked\nclosely with Manville to learn what its insured knew and\nto assess the dangers of asbestos exposure; it evaluated\nManville’s potential liability and defenses, and paid Man\nville’s litigation costs. Id., at 114a–117a, 121a–122a. In\n1982, the prospect of overwhelming liability led Manville\nto file for bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of\nNew York.\n   It thus became incumbent on the Bankruptcy Court to\ndevise “a plan of reorganization for [Manville] which\nwould provide for payment to holders of present or known\nasbestos health related claims . . . and [to] those persons\nwho had not yet manifested an injury but who would\nmanifest symptoms of asbestos-related illnesses at some\nfuture time.” In re Johns-Manville Corp., 97 B. R. 174,\n176 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1989). The ensuing reorganization\nplan created the Manville Personal Injury Settlement\nTrust (Trust) to pay all asbestos claims against Manville,\nwhich would be channeled to the Trust. See Kane v.\nJohns-Manville Corp., 843 F. 2d 636, 640–641 (CA2 1988);\nIn re Johns-Manville Corp., 340 B. R. 49, 54 (SDNY 2006).\nThe Trust has since paid out more than $3.2 billion to over\n600,000 claimants. Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 136a–137a.\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the period leading up to the reorganization, Manville\nand its insurers litigated over the scope and limits of\nliability coverage, and Travelers faced suits by third par\nties, such as Manville factory workers and vendors of\nManville products, seeking compensation under the insur\nance policies. There was also litigation among the insur\ners themselves, who brought various indemnity claims,\ncontribution claims, and cross-claims. Id., at 132a–134a.\nIn a settlement described as the “cornerstone” of the Man\nville reorganization, the insurers agreed to provide most of\nthe initial corpus of the Trust, with a payment of $770\nmillion to the bankruptcy estate, $80 million of it from\nTravelers. MacArthur Co. v. Johns-Manville Corp., 837\nF. 2d 89, 90 (CA2 1988); Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 134a; In re Johns-\nManville Corp., 68 B. R. 618, 621 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY\n1986).\n   There would have been no such payment without the\ninjunction at the heart of the present dispute. The De\ncember 18, 1986, order of the Bankruptcy Court approving\nthe insurance settlement agreements (Insurance Settle\nment Order) provides that, upon the insurers’ payment of\nthe settlement funds to the Trust, “all Persons are perma\nnently restrained and enjoined from commencing and/or\ncontinuing any suit, arbitration or other proceeding of any\ntype or nature for Policy Claims against any or all mem\nbers of the Settling Insurer Group.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 08–295, at 446a. The Insurance Settlement Order\ngoes on to provide that the insurers are “released from any\nand all Policy Claims,” which are to be channeled to the\nTrust. Ibid. The order defines “Policy Claims” as “any\nand all claims, demands, allegations, duties, liabilities and\nobligations (whether or not presently known) which have\nbeen, or could have been, or might be, asserted by any\nPerson against . . . any or all members of the Settling\nInsurer Group based upon, arising out of or relating to any\nor all of the Policies.” Id., at 439a. The insurers were\n4            TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled “to terminate the settlements if the injunctive\norders [were] not issued or if they [were] set aside on\nappeal.” MacArthur, supra, at 90.\n  The Insurance Settlement Order was incorporated by\nreference in the Bankruptcy Court’s December 22, 1986,\norder confirming Manville’s Second Amended and Re\nstated Plan of Reorganization (Confirmation Order).1 App.\nto Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–295, at 271a–272a. Both the\nConfirmation Order and the Insurance Settlement Order\n(collectively, 1986 Orders) were affirmed by the District\nCourt, see In re Johns-Manville Corp., 78 B. R. 407 (SDNY\n1987), and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see\nMacArthur, supra; Kane, supra.\n  Nonetheless, over a decade later plaintiffs started filing\nasbestos actions against Travelers in various state courts,\ncases that have been spoken of in this litigation as Direct\nActions. They are of two sorts. The Statutory Direct\nActions are brought under state consumer-protection\nstatutes, and allege that Travelers conspired with other\ninsurers and with asbestos manufacturers to hide the\ndangers of asbestos and to raise a fraudulent “state of the\nart” (or “no duty to warn”) defense to personal injury\nclaims. Bkrtcy. Ct. Op. 140a–143a. The Common Law\nDirect Actions claim that Travelers violated common law\nduties by failing to warn the public about the dangers of\nasbestos or by acting to keep its knowledge of those dan\ngers from the public. Id., at 143a–147a. It is undisputed\nthat many of the plaintiffs seek to recover from Travelers,\nnot indirectly for Manville’s wrongdoing, but for Travelers’\nown alleged violations of state law. See 517 F. 3d, at 63.2\n——————\n  1 The Confirmation Order itself contains an additional injunction\n\nbarring certain claims against the settling insurance companies.\nBkrtcy. Ct. Op. 286a–288a. That injunction does not bear on our\ndecision, and we do not consider it.\n  2 A true “direct action” suit is “[a] lawsuit by a person claiming\n\nagainst an insured but suing the insurer directly instead of pursuing\n                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 2002, Travelers invoked the terms of the 1986 Orders\nin moving the Bankruptcy Court to enjoin 26 Direct Ac\ntions pending in state courts. Id., at 58. The court issued\na temporary restraining order, repeatedly extended, and\nreferred the parties to mediation, which led to settlements\nbetween Travelers and three sets of plaintiffs in both\nStatutory and Common Law Direct Actions. Bkrtcy. Ct.\nOp. 103a–104a. Under the settlement terms Travelers\nwould pay more than $400 million to settlement funds to\ncompensate Direct Action claimants, contingent upon the\nentry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court clarifying that\nthe Direct Actions were, and remained, prohibited by the\n1986 Orders. Id., at 150a–152a. The settlement requires\nclaimants seeking payment from the settlement funds to\ngrant Travelers a release from further liability, separate\nand apart from Travelers’ protection under the 1986 Or\nders. Id., at 151a–152a.\n   After notice of the settlement was given to potential\nclaimants, the Bankruptcy Court (the same judge who had\nissued the 1986 Orders) held an evidentiary hearing and\nmade extensive factual findings that are not challenged\nhere. The court determined that “Travelers[’] knowledge\nof the hazards of asbestos was derived from its nearly\nthree decade insurance relationship with Manville and the\nperformance by Travelers of its obligations under the\nPolicies, including through the underwriting, loss control\nactivities, defense obligations and generally through its\nlengthy and confidential insurance relationship under the\n——————\ncompensation indirectly through the insured.” Black’s Law Dictionary\n491 (8th ed. 2004). Because many of the suits at issue seek to hold\nTravelers liable for independent wrongdoing rather than for a legal\nwrong by Manville, they are not direct actions in the terms of strict\nusage. Nonetheless, because the suits are referred to as “direct actions”\nin the decisions of the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court, and the\nCourt of Appeals, we call them that as well, in the interest of simplicity.\nSee 517 F. 3d, at 55, n. 4.\n6           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npolicies.” Id., at 128a–129a. In sum, the Bankruptcy\nCourt found that “Travelers learned virtually everything it\nknew about asbestos from its relationship with Manville.”\nId., at 131a.\n    As for the Direct Actions, the court saw “[t]he gravamen\nof the Statutory Direct Action Lawsuits” as “center[ing] on\nTravelers[’] defense of Manville in asbestos-related\nclaims.” Id., at 142a. The court read the “alleged factual\npredicate” of the Common Law Direct Actions as being\n“essentially identical to the statutory actions: Travelers\n. . . influence[d] Manville’s purported failure to disclose\nknowledge about asbestos hazards; Travelers defended\nManville; Travelers advanced the state of the art defense;\nand Travelers coordinated Manville’s national defense\neffort.” Id., at 147a (citations omitted). The court under\nstood “the direct action claims against Travelers [to be]\ninextricably intertwined with Travelers[’] long relation\nship as Manville’s insurer,” id., at 169a, and found that\n“[a]fter the Court preliminarily enjoined prosecution of\nDirect Action Claims against Travelers pending final\nruling on the merits, certain plaintiffs’ lawyers violated\nthe letter and the spirit of this Court’s rulings by simply\ndeleting the term ‘Manville’ from their complaints—but\nleaving the substance unchanged,” id., at 147a.\n    Hence, the court’s conclusion that “[t]he evidence in this\nproceeding establishes that the gravamen of Direct Action\nClaims were acts or omissions by Travelers arising from or\nrelating to Travelers[’] insurance relationship with Man\nville.” Id., at 173a. Finding that the “claims against\nTravelers based on such actions or omissions necessarily\n‘arise out of’ and [are] ‘related to’ ” the insurance policies,\nibid., which compelled Travelers to defend Manville\nagainst asbestos-related claims, id., at 173a–176a, the\nBankruptcy Court held that the Direct Actions “are—and\nalways have been—permanently barred” by the 1986\nOrders, id., at 170a.\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)               7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n  The settlement was accordingly approved and an order\ndated August 17, 2004 (Clarifying Order), was entered,\nproviding that the 1986 Orders barred the pending Direct\nActions and “[t]he commencement or prosecution of all\nactions and proceedings against Travelers that directly or\nindirectly are based upon, arise out of or relate to Travel\ners[’] insurance relationship with Manville or Travelers[’]\nknowledge or alleged knowledge concerning the hazards of\nasbestos,” including claims for contribution or indemnifi\ncation. Id., at 95a. The Clarifying Order does not, how\never, block “the commencement and prosecution of claims\nagainst Travelers by policyholders other than Manville . . .\nfor insurance proceeds or other obligations arising under\nany policy of insurance provided by Travelers to a policy\nholder other than Manville.” Id., at 96a. The Clarifying\nOrder also separately disclaims that it enjoins bringing\n    “claims arising from contractual obligations by Trav\n    elers to policyholders other than Manville, as long as\n    Travelers[’] alleged liability or the proof required to\n    establish Travelers[’] alleged liability is unrelated to\n    any knowledge Travelers gained from its insurance\n    relationship with Manville or acts, errors, omissions\n    or evidence related to Travelers[’] insurance relation\n    ship with Manville.” Ibid.\n  Some individual claimants and Chubb Indemnity Insur\nance Company (Chubb), respondents before this Court,\nobjected to the settlement and subsequently appealed.3 So\nfar as it matters here, the District Court affirmed, but the\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. In\npresenting the case to the Second Circuit the objectors\nargued that the Direct Actions fall outside the scope of the\n——————\n 3 Chubb   is a codefendant with Travelers in certain Common Law\nDirect Actions, and the Clarifying Order prevents it from bringing\ncontribution and indemnity claims against Travelers under certain\ncircumstances. See Brief for Respondent Chubb 16.\n8           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1986 Orders and that the Clarifying Order erroneously\nexpands those orders to bar actions beyond the Bank\nruptcy Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction and statutory\nauthority. Travelers and the settling claimants responded\nthat the Clarifying Order is consistent with the terms of\nthe 1986 Orders, that this reading of the 1986 Orders does\nnot generate any jurisdictional or other statutory con\ncerns, and that the Second Circuit’s prior rejection of a\nchallenge to the Insurance Settlement Order in MacAr­\nthur, 837 F. 2d 89, is controlling.\n   In its opinion explaining the judgment under review\nhere, the Second Circuit recognized that “[i]t is undisputed\nthat the bankruptcy court had continuing jurisdiction to\ninterpret and enforce its own 1986 orders,” and that “there\nis no doubt that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to\nclarify its prior orders.” 517 F. 3d, at 60–61. It also had\n“little doubt that, in a literal sense, the instant claims\nagainst Travelers ‘arise out of’ its provision of insurance\ncoverage to Manville,” id., at 67, and the court emphasized\nthat “[t]he bankruptcy court’s extensive factual findings\nregarding Manville’s all-encompassing presence in the\nasbestos industry and its extensive relationship with\nTravelers support this notion” that the subjects of the\nClarifying Order fall within the scope of the 1986 Orders,\nibid. The Circuit nevertheless held that the Bankruptcy\nCourt could not, in enforcing the 1986 Orders, “enjoin\nclaims over which it had no jurisdiction,” id., at 61, and\nthat “[t]he ancillary jurisdiction courts possess to enforce\ntheir own orders is itself limited by the jurisdictional\nlimits of the order sought to be enforced,” id., at 65, n. 22\n(internal quotation marks omitted). See also id., at 65\n(“The fact that our case involves a clarification of the\nbankruptcy court’s prior order does not alter the jurisdic\ntional predicate necessary to enjoin third-party non-debtor\nclaims”).\n   The Court of Appeals found that “the jurisdictional\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nanalysis by the lower courts falls short,” id., at 62, in\nfailing to recognize the significance of the fact that the\nDirect Actions “do not seek to collect on the basis of Man\nville’s conduct,” but rather “seek to recover directly from\nTravelers, a non-debtor insurer, for its own alleged mis\nconduct,” id., at 63. The Court of Appeals held that the\nBankruptcy Court mistook its jurisdiction when it en\njoined “claims brought against a third-party non-debtor\nsolely on the basis of that third-party’s financial contribu\ntion to a debtor’s estate,” because “a bankruptcy court only\nhas jurisdiction to enjoin third-party non-debtor claims\nthat directly affect the res of the bankruptcy estate.” Id.,\nat 66.\n   In reaching this result, the court explained that its prior\ndecision in MacArthur was not controlling, as there a\nManville asbestos distributor had challenged the authority\nof the Bankruptcy Court to bar it from collecting out of\nManville’s own insurance coverage. 517 F. 3d, at 62.\nHere, by contrast, “Travelers candidly admits that both\nthe statutory and common law claims seek damages from\nTravelers that are unrelated to the policy proceeds.” Id.,\nat 63. The Court of Appeals also considered the 1994\nenactment of 11 U. S. C. §524(g), which provides explicit\nstatutory authority for a bankruptcy court to order the\nchanneling of claims against a debtor’s insurers to the\nbankruptcy estate, but the court understood §524(g) to be\n“limited to situations where a third party has derivative\nliability for the claims against the debtor” and “was not\nintended to reach non-derivative claims.” 517 F. 3d, at 68\n(ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted).\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009) and now\nreverse.\n                             II\n  The Bankruptcy Court correctly understood that the\nDirect Actions fall within the scope of the 1986 Orders, as\n10          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsuits of this sort always have. The Court of Appeals,\nhowever, believed it was free to look beyond the terms of\nthe 1986 Orders and so treated the action as one “con\ncern[ing] the outer reaches of a bankruptcy court’s juris\ndiction.” 517 F. 3d, at 55. This, we think, was error. If\nthis were a direct review of the 1986 Orders, the Court of\nAppeals would indeed have been duty bound to consider\nwhether the Bankruptcy Court had acted beyond its sub\nject-matter jurisdiction. See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006); Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v.\nSwan, 111 U. S. 379, 382 (1884). But the 1986 Orders\nbecame final on direct review over two decades ago, and\nTravelers’ response to the Circuit’s jurisdictional ruling is\ncorrect: whether the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction\nand authority to enter the injunction in 1986 was not\nproperly before the Court of Appeals in 2008 and is not\nproperly before us.\n                               A\n   We begin at our point of agreement with the Second\nCircuit, that the Direct Actions are “Policy Claims” en\njoined as against Travelers by the language of the 1986\nOrders, which covered “claims, demands, allegations,\nduties, liabilities and obligations” against Travelers,\nknown or unknown at the time, “based upon, arising out of\nor relating to” Travelers’ insurance coverage of Manville.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08–295, at 439a. In a statute,\n“[t]he phrase ‘in relation to’ is expansive,” Smith v. United\nStates, 508 U. S. 223, 237 (1993), and so is its reach here,\nwhere “Policy Claims” covers not only “claims,” but even\n“allegations” relating to the insurance coverage. Although\nit would be possible (albeit quite a stretch) to suggest that\na “claim” only relates to Travelers’ insurance coverage if it\nseeks recovery based upon Travelers’ specific contractual\nobligation to Manville, “allegations” is not even remotely\namenable to such a narrow construction and clearly\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreaches factual assertions that relate in a more compre\nhensive way to Travelers’ dealings with Manville.\n   The Bankruptcy Court’s uncontested factual findings\ndrive the point home. In substance, the Bankruptcy Court\nfound that the Direct Actions seek to recover against\nTravelers either for supposed wrongdoing in its capacity\nas Manville’s insurer or for improper use of information\nthat Travelers obtained from Manville as its insurer.\nThese actions so clearly involve “claims” (and, all the more\nso, “allegations”) “based upon, arising out of or relating to”\nTravelers’ insurance coverage of Manville, that we have no\nneed here to stake out the ultimate bounds of the injunc\ntion. There is, of course, a cutoff at some point, where the\nconnection between the insurer’s action complained of and\nthe insurance coverage would be thin to the point of ab\nsurd. See California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement\nv. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316, 335\n(1997) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“[A]pplying the ‘relate to’\nprovision according to its terms was a project doomed to\nfailure, since, as many a curbstone philosopher has ob\nserved, everything is related to everything else”); New\nYork State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans\nv. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655 (1995). But the\ndetailed findings of the Bankruptcy Court place the Direct\nActions within the terms of the 1986 Orders without\npushing the limits.\n   Respondents argue that this is just revisionism perpe\ntrated by the Clarifying Order, which they say improperly\nexpanded the scope of the 1986 Orders to enjoin the Direct\nActions. Their position appears to be that the 1986 Orders\nonly bar actions against insurers seeking to recover de\nrivatively for Manville’s wrongdoing, but not actions to\nrecover for Travelers’ own misconduct, no matter what its\nrelationship to Travelers’ coverage of Manville. But this\nsimply is not what the 1986 Orders say. The definition of\n“Policy Claims” contains nothing limiting it to derivative\n12          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nactions, and there is language in the 1986 Orders directly\nto the contrary: The 1986 Orders not only enjoin bringing\nexpansively defined “Policy Claims” against the settling\ninsurers, but they go on to provide that the injunction has\nno application to a claim previously brought against a\nsettling insurer “seeking any and all damages (other than\nor in addition to policy proceeds) for bad faith or other\ninsurer misconduct alleged in connection with the han\ndling or disposition of claims.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n08–295, at 446a. There is no doubt about the implication,\nthat this same sort of claim brought after the 1986 Orders\nbecome final will be barred. There would have been no\nneed for this exception if “Policy Claims” were limited to\nclaims against Travelers for Manville’s wrongdoing.\n   Respondents seek further refuge in evidence that before\nentry of the 1986 Orders some parties to the Manville\nbankruptcy (including Travelers) understood the proposed\ninjunction to bar only claims derivative of Manville’s\nliability. They may well be right about that: we are in no\nposition to engage in factfinding on this point, but there\ncertainly are statements in the record that seem to sup\nport respondents’ contention. See App. for Respondent\nChubb 1a–3a, 5a, 13a–14a. But be that as it may, where\nthe plain terms of a court order unambiguously apply, as\nthey do here, they are entitled to their effect. See, e.g.,\nNegrón-Almeda v. Santiago, 528 F. 3d 15, 23 (CA1 2008)\n(“[A] court must carry out and enforce an order that is\nclear and unambiguous on its face”); United States v.\nSpallone, 399 F. 3d 415, 421 (CA2 2005) (“[I]f a judgment\nis clear and unambiguous, a court must adopt, and give\neffect to, the plain meaning of the judgment” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). If it is black-letter law that\nthe terms of an unambiguous private contract must be\nenforced irrespective of the parties’ subjective intent, see\n11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts §30:4 (4th ed. 1999), it\nis all the clearer that a court should enforce a court order,\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\na public governmental act, according to its unambiguous\nterms.4 This is all the Bankruptcy Court did.\n                               B\n  Given the Clarifying Order’s correct reading of the 1986\nOrders, the only question left is whether the Bankruptcy\nCourt had subject-matter jurisdiction to enter the Clarify\ning Order. The answer here is easy: as the Second Circuit\nrecognized, and respondents do not dispute, the Bank\nruptcy Court plainly had jurisdiction to interpret and\nenforce its own prior orders. See Local Loan Co. v. Hunt,\n292 U. S. 234, 239 (1934). What is more, when the Bank\nruptcy Court issued the 1986 Orders it explicitly retained\njurisdiction to enforce its injunctions. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 08–295, at 284a–286a.\n  The Court of Appeals, however, went on to a different\njurisdictional enquiry. It held that the 1986 Orders could\nnot be enforced according to their terms because, as the\npanel saw it, the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its\njurisdiction when it issued the orders in 1986. We think,\nthough, that it was error for the Court of Appeals to re\nevaluate the Bankruptcy Court’s exercise of jurisdiction in\n——————\n   4 Even if we found the 1986 Orders to be ambiguous as applied to the\n\nDirect Actions, and even if we concluded that it would be proper to look\nto the parties’ communications to resolve that ambiguity, it is far from\nclear that respondents would be entitled to upset the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s interpretation of the 1986 Orders. Numerous Courts of Appeals\nhave held that a bankruptcy court’s interpretation of its own confirma\ntion order is entitled to substantial deference. See In re Shenango\nGroup Inc., 501 F. 3d 338, 346 (CA3 2007); In re Dow Corning Corp.,\n456 F. 3d 668, 675 (CA6 2006); In re Optical Technologies, Inc., 425\nF. 3d 1294, 1300 (CA11 2005); In re Dial Business Forms, Inc., 341\nF. 3d 738, 744 (CA8 2003); In re National Gypsum Co., 219 F. 3d 478,\n484 (CA5 2000); In re Casse, 198 F. 3d 327, 333 (CA2 1999); In re\nTomlin, 105 F. 3d 933, 941 (CA4 1997); Monarch Life Ins.

Because the 1986 Orders clearly cover the Direct Actions,\nwe need not determine the proper standard of review.\n14            TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1986.\n   On direct appeal of the 1986 Orders, anyone who ob\njected was free to argue that the Bankruptcy Court had\nexceeded its jurisdiction, and the District Court or Court\nof Appeals could have raised such concerns sua sponte. In\nfact, one objector argued just that. In MacArthur, a dis\ntributor of Manville asbestos claimed to be a coinsured\nunder certain Manville insurance policies and argued that\nthe 1986 Orders exceeded the Bankruptcy Court’s jurisdic\ntion by preventing the distributor from recovering under\nthe policies; the Second Circuit disagreed, concluding that\nthe Bankruptcy Court had not stepped outside its jurisdic\ntion or statutory authority.5 See 837 F. 2d, at 91–94. But\nonce the 1986 Orders became final on direct review\n(whether or not proper exercises of bankruptcy court\njurisdiction and power), they became res judicata to the\n“ ‘parties and those in privity with them, not only as to\nevery matter which was offered and received to sustain or\ndefeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible\nmatter which might have been offered for that purpose.’ ”\nNevada v. United States, 463 U. S. 110, 130 (1983) (quot\ning Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351, 352 (1877)).\n   Those orders are not any the less preclusive because the\nattack is on the Bankruptcy Court’s conformity with its\nsubject-matter jurisdiction, for “[e]ven subject-matter\njurisdiction . . . may not be attacked collaterally.” Kon­\n——————\n  5 We  agree with the Court of Appeals that MacArthur only resolved\nthe narrow question whether the Bankruptcy Court could enjoin\nderivative claims against the insurers and did not address whether the\n1986 Orders, in their entirety, were proper. We note MacArthur merely\nto illustrate the obvious: the 1986 Orders were subject to challenge, on\njurisdictional grounds or otherwise, on direct review. The dissent\nsuggests that MacArthur limited the scope of the 1986 Orders to\nderivative claims, see post, at 1, 7–9, but it did not. The question\nwhether the Bankruptcy Court had enjoined or could properly enjoin\nnonderivative claims was not at issue in MacArthur and the court did\nnot answer it.\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

Their determina\ntions of such questions, while open to direct review, may\nnot be assailed collaterally”). So long as respondents or\nthose in privity with them were parties to the Manville\nbankruptcy proceeding, and were given a fair chance to\nchallenge the Bankruptcy Court’s subject-matter jurisdic\ntion, they cannot challenge it now by resisting enforce\nment of the 1986 Orders.

See,\ne.g., United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U.

More broadly, the Restatement (Second) of Judg\nments §12, p. 115 (1980), describes three exceptional circumstances in\nwhich a collateral attack on subject-matter jurisdiction is permitted:\n   “(1) The subject matter of the action was so plainly beyond the court’s\njurisdiction that its entertaining the action was a manifest abuse of\n16            TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The willingness of the Court of Appeals to entertain this\nsort of collateral attack cannot be squared with res judi\ncata and the practical necessity served by that rule. “It is\njust as important that there should be a place to end as\nthat there should be a place to begin litigation,” Stoll v.\nGottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172 (1938), and the need for final\nity forbids a court called upon to enforce a final order to\n“tunnel back . . . for the purpose of reassessing prior juris\ndiction de novo,” In re Optical Technologies, Inc., 425 F. 3d\n1294, 1308 (CA11 2005). If the law were otherwise, and\n“courts could evaluate the jurisdiction that they may or\nmay not have had to issue a final judgment, the rules of\nres judicata . . . would be entirely short-circuited.” Id., at\n1307; see Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503 U. S. 131, 137 (1992)\n(“[T]he practical concern with providing an end to litiga\ntion justifies a rule preventing collateral attack on subject\nmatter jurisdiction”). Almost a quarter-century after the\n1986 Orders were entered, the time to prune them is over.7\n——————\nauthority; or\n  “(2) Allowing the judgment to stand would substantially infringe the\nauthority of another tribunal or agency of government; or\n  “(3) The judgment was rendered by a court lacking capability to make\nan adequately informed determination of a question concerning its own\njurisdiction and as a matter of procedural fairness the party seeking to\navoid the judgment should have opportunity belatedly to attack the\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction.”\nThis is no occasion to address whether we adopt all of these exceptions.\nRespondents do not claim any of them, and we do not see how any\nwould apply here. This is not a situation, for example, in which a\nbankruptcy court decided to conduct a criminal trial, or to resolve a\ncustody dispute, matters “so plainly beyond the court’s jurisdiction”\nthat a different result might be called for.\n  7 Respondents point out that it is Travelers, not they, who moved the\n\nBankruptcy Court to enforce the 1986 Orders. But who began the\npresent proceedings has no bearing on the application of res judicata; to\nthe extent respondents argue that the 1986 Orders should not be\nenforced according to their terms because of a jurisdictional flaw in\n1986, this argument is an impermissible collateral attack. And to the\nextent respondents disclaim any initial intent to mount such an attack,\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

We do not resolve whether a\nbankruptcy court, in 1986 or today, could properly enjoin\nclaims against nondebtor insurers that are not derivative\nof the debtor’s wrongdoing. As the Court of Appeals noted,\nin 1994 Congress explicitly authorized bankruptcy courts,\nin some circumstances, to enjoin actions against a non\ndebtor “alleged to be directly or indirectly liable for the\nconduct of, claims against, or demands on the debtor to the\nextent such alleged liability . . . arises by reason of . . . the\nthird party’s provision of insurance to the debtor or a\nrelated party,” and to channel those claims to a trust for\npayments to asbestos claimants.             11 U. S. C. §524\n(g)(4)(A)(ii). On direct review today, a channeling injunc\ntion of the sort issued by the Bankruptcy Court in 1986\nwould have to be measured against the requirements of\n§524 (to begin with, at least). But owing to the posture of\nthis litigation, we do not address the scope of an injunction\nauthorized by that section.8\n   Nor do we decide whether any particular respondent is\nbound by the 1986 Orders. We have assumed that re\nspondents are bound, but the Court of Appeals did not\nconsider this question. Chubb, in fact, relying on Amchem\nProducts, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U. S. 591 (1997), and Ortiz\nv. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U. S. 815 (1999), has maintained\nthat it was not given constitutionally sufficient notice of\nthe 1986 Orders, so that due process absolves it from\nfollowing them, whatever their scope. See 340 B. R., at 68.\nThe District Court rejected this argument, id., at 68–69,\nbut the Court of Appeals did not reach it, 517 F. 3d, at 60,\n\n——————\nthis too is irrelevant, since the decision of the Court of Appeals is what\nwe review and find at odds with finality.\n  8 Section 524(h) provides that under some circumstances §524(g) op\n\nerates retroactively to validate an injunction.

I disagree. In my view, the injunction bars\nonly those claims against Manville’s insurers seeking to\nrecover from the bankruptcy estate for Manville’s miscon\nduct, not those claims seeking to recover against the in\nsurers for their own misconduct. This interpretation\nrespects the limits of the Bankruptcy Court’s power; it is\nconsistent with the Court of Appeals’ understanding when\nit upheld the 1986 injunction on direct review and with\nCongress’ codification of the Manville bankruptcy ap\nproach for future asbestos proceedings in 11 U. S. C.\n§524(g); and it makes sense of Travelers’ payment of $445\n2          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmillion in 2004 in exchange for a Bankruptcy Court order\nthat supposedly “clarified” an unambiguous injunction.\n  Because the 1986 injunction has never meant what the\nCourt today assumes, respondents’ challenge is not an\nimpermissible collateral attack. The Court of Appeals\ncorrectly concluded that the Bankruptcy Court’s 2004\norder improperly enjoined the state-law claims at issue in\nthis proceeding.\n                               I\n   At the heart of the dispute in this litigation is the dis\ntinction between two types of lawsuits seeking recovery\nfrom Manville’s primary insurer, The Travelers Indemnity\nCompany, and its affiliates (together, Travelers). The first\nclass, which I shall call “insurer actions,” comprises suits\nin which the plaintiff is asserting that Travelers, as an\ninsurer of Manville, has a duty to satisfy the plaintiff’s\nclaim against Manville. Plaintiffs in that class include not\nonly members of the public exposed to asbestos but also\nManville factory workers and vendors of Manville prod\nucts. The second class, which I shall call “independent\nactions,” comprises suits in which the plaintiff is asserting\nthat Travelers is liable for its own misconduct. The plain\ntiffs in these suits have alleged both violations of state\nconsumer-protection laws and breaches of common-law\nduties. See ante, at 4.\n   Suits that are called “direct actions” in the proceedings\nbelow and in the Court’s opinion may fall in either cate\ngory, but as the Court acknowledges the “true” definition\nof that term describes only insurer actions. Ante, at 4–5,\nn. 2; see Black’s Law Dictionary 491 (8th ed. 2004). True\ndirect actions are lawsuits in which a plaintiff claims that\nshe was injured by Manville and seeks recovery directly\nfrom its insurer without first obtaining a judgment\nagainst Manville. The global settlement that made the\n1986 reorganization of Manville possible clearly encom\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npassed all such direct actions; Manville’s insurers paid\n$770 million, including $80 million from Travelers, into\nthe Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust (Manville\nTrust) to which these actions would be channeled. But\nmany of the claims that gave rise to the instant litigation\nallege no breach of duty by Manville and seek no recovery\nfrom the Manville Trust. See ante, at 4–5, n. 2. They are\nclaims against Travelers based on its own alleged viola\ntions of state statutes and common-law rules. Thus, even\nthough the Court calls these claims “direct actions,” they\nare nothing of the sort. They are independent actions.\n   Some of the independent actions are based on facts\nconcerning Travelers’ insurance relationship with Man\nville. A number of suits, for example, allege that Travel\ners acquired information about asbestos-related hazards\nfrom Manville that it had a duty to disclose to third par\nties.1 This sort of factual nexus does not, however, trans\nform an independent action into an insurer action. In\nstead, the question remains whether a suit seeks to\nrecover from Travelers for Manville’s wrongdoing or in\nstead seeks to recover from Travelers for its own wrongdo\ning, making no claim on Manville’s insurance policy pro\nceeds or other assets of the Manville bankruptcy estate.\n   Recognizing the distinction between insurer actions and\nindependent actions, the Court of Appeals held that the\nBankruptcy Court had improperly enjoined the latter in\nits 2004 order.2 Without ruling on the extent of the Bank\nruptcy Court’s power, see ante, at 17, the Court today\n——————\n  1 The theories asserted in many of the state-law actions are novel,\nand, as the Court of Appeals noted, these claims “have met with almost\nuniversal failure in the state courts.” In re Johns-Manville Corp., 517\nF. 3d 52, 68 (CA2 2008).\n  2 The Court of Appeals noted that the Bankruptcy Court had not con\n\nsidered whether the various actions at issue were properly classified as\ninsurer actions or independent actions, and it remanded for the Bank\nruptcy Court to undertake this assessment.\n4             TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nconcludes that the 1986 injunction unambiguously barred\nindependent actions and that the Bankruptcy Court’s 2004\norder simply clarified, and did not enlarge, the scope of\nthat injunction. Based on that premise, the Court holds\nthat respondents are challenging the Bankruptcy Court’s\nauthority to have issued the injunction in 1986, and it\ndeems the challenge an impermissible collateral attack. I\ndisagree with both the Court’s understanding of the 1986\ninjunction and its attendant res judicata analysis.\n                             II\n  The 1986 order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the\ninsurance settlement agreements (Insurance Settlement\nOrder), which was incorporated by reference in the order\nconfirming Manville’s plan of reorganization, includes\nthree related protections for Manville’s insurers, each\nfocused on the company’s insurance policies. It releases\nthe insurers from all “Policy Claims,” channels these\nclaims to the Manville Trust, and permanently enjoins all\npersons from commencing or continuing a proceeding for\n“Policy Claims” against a settling insurer. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 445a–446a. The Insurance Settlement Order defines\n“Policy Claims” as:\n       “any and all claims, demands, allegations, duties, li\n       abilities and obligations (whether or not presently\n       known) which have been, or could have been, or might\n       be, asserted by any Person against any or all members\n       of the [Manville] Group or against any or all members\n       of the Settling Insurer Group based upon, arising out\n       of or relating to any or all of the Policies.” Id., at 439a\n       (emphasis added).3\n\n——————\n    3 As\n       the Court notes, the order confirming Manville’s reorganization\nplan contains an additional injunction barring claims against the\nsettling insurance companies. Ante, at 4, n. 1. The language in that\norder enjoins only insurer actions. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 286a–288a\n                      Cite as: 557 U.

Thus,\nit concludes that “the plain terms of [the] court order\nunambiguously” bar independent actions. Ante, at 12.\n   The Court doth protest too much. Indeed, despite its\ninsistence that the definition of “Policy Claims” is unam\nbiguous, the Court quickly concludes that it cannot apply\nthe “based upon, arising out of or relating to” language\nliterally because there is a “cutoff at some point, where the\nconnection between the insurer’s action complained of and\nthe insurance coverage would be thin to the point of ab\nsurd.” Ante, at 11. Presumably, for instance, the Court\nwould not deem enjoined a state-law claim for personal\ninjuries caused by a Travelers’ agent’s reckless driving\nwhile en route to the courthouse to defend Manville even\nthough, in a literal sense, this suit relates to (perhaps\neven arises out of) Travelers’ performance of its policy\nobligations to Manville. The Court determines that it\nneed not “stake out the ultimate bounds of the injunction”\nbecause it can rely on the Bankruptcy Court’s “uncon\ntested factual findings” that the particular independent\nactions at issue fall within the category that it had in\ntended to enjoin. Ibid.\n   If the definition of the term “Policy Claims” is not ame\nnable to a purely literal construction and the Court must\nlook beyond the four corners of the Insurance Settlement\n—————— \n\n(enjoining actions against settling insurance companies seeking,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, to recover on or with respect to a “Claim, Interest,\n\nor Other Asbestos Obligation”); id., at 56a, n. 6 (defining “Other Asbes\n\ntos Obligation” as an obligation arising directly or indirectly from acts\n\nor omissions of a debtor). The parties accordingly focus on whether the \n\nInsurance Settlement Agreement enjoins independent actions. \n\n6           TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nOrder to ascertain its meaning, however, the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s factual findings in 2004 are not the best guide. I\nwould instead construe the order with reference to the\nlimits of the Bankruptcy Court’s authority—limits that\nwere well understood by the insurers during the original\nsettlement negotiations—and with reference to the Court\nof Appeals’ interpretation of the Insurance Settlement\nOrder when it upheld it against a jurisdictional challenge\nin 1988.\n   We should not lightly assume that the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order that exceeded its authority. When\na bankruptcy proceeding is commenced, the bankruptcy\ncourt acquires control of the debtor’s assets and the power\nto discharge its debts. A bankruptcy court has no author\nity, however, to adjudicate, settle, or enjoin claims against\nnondebtors that do not affect the debtor’s estate. Because\nTravelers’ insurance policies were a significant asset of the\nManville bankruptcy estate, the Bankruptcy Court had\nthe power to channel claims to the insurance proceeds to\nthe Manville Trust. But this by no means gave it the\npower to enjoin claims against nondebtors like Travelers\nthat had no impact on the bankruptcy estate. Thus, even\naccepting the Bankruptcy Court’s representation in 2004\nthat it had “meant to provide the broadest protection\npossible” to the settling insurers, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n172a, such relief could not include protection from inde\npendent actions.\n   That the Bankruptcy Court was without authority to\nenjoin independent actions was well understood by both\nManville and Travelers during their settlement negotia\ntions. In Manville’s memorandum in support of the Insur\nance Settlement Agreement, it clarified that it did “not\nseek to have [the Bankruptcy] Court release its Settling\nInsurers from claims by third parties based on the In\nsurer’s own tortious misconduct towards the third party”\nbut rather sought only to release the insurers “from the\n                     Cite as: 557 U.

This understanding reflected\nnot only the basic fact that the settlement was between\nManville and its insurers (and not third parties), but also\nthe parties’ knowledge that the “Second Circuit [had held]\nthat the bankruptcy courts lack power to discharge ‘inde\npendent’ claims of third parties against nondebtors.” Id.,\nat 5a–6a.\n   Travelers similarly acknowledged the limits of the\nBankruptcy Court’s power. Noting that “[t]he court has in\nrem jurisdiction over the Policies and thus the power to\nenter appropriate orders to protect that jurisdiction,” it\nstated that “the injunction is intended only to restrain\nclaims against the res (i.e., the Policies) which are or may\nbe asserted, against the Settling Insurers.” Id., at 13a–\n14a;4 see also id., at 10a (memorandum of the legal repre\nsentative of the Bankruptcy Court noting that “[a]ll par\nties seem to agree that any injunction, channeling order\nand release is limited to this Court’s jurisdiction over the\nres”). In short, it was apparent to the settling parties, and\nno doubt also to the Bankruptcy Court, that the court\nlacked the power to enjoin third-party claims against\nnondebtors that did not affect the debtor’s estate.\n   When the Court of Appeals upheld the injunction bar\nring the assertion of “Policy Claims” against Manville’s\ninsurers it, too, understood these limits of the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s authority. MacArthur Corporation, a Manville\nasbestos distributor, claimed to be a coinsured under\nManville’s insurance policies by virtue of “vendor en\n\n——————\n  4 This statement of Travelers’ intent belies the Bankruptcy Court’s\nsuggestion that enjoining independent actions was a necessary condi\ntion of Travelers’ contribution to the Manville estate.

MacArthur argued that the Bank\nruptcy Court lacked authority to issue the Insurance\nSettlement Order, which prevented it from suing the\ninsurers, because this order constituted a de facto dis\ncharge in bankruptcy of nondebtor parties not entitled to\nChapter 11 protection. In rejecting MacArthur’s argu\nment, the Court of Appeals did not hold that the Bank\nruptcy Court possessed the authority to enjoin all actions\nagainst the insurers bearing some factual connection to\nManville. Rather, it held that MacArthur had miscon\nstrued the scope of the Bankruptcy Court’s order, which\nprecluded “only those suits against the settling insurers\nthat arise out of or relate to Manville’s insurance policies.”\nMacArthur Co. v. Johns-Manville Corp., 837 F. 2d 89, 91\n(CA2 1988).\n   The Court of Appeals reasoned that this language en\njoined MacArthur’s claims because “MacArthur’s rights as\nan insured vendor are completely derivative of Manville’s\nrights as the primary insured.” Id., at 92. Just as asbes\ntos victims were “barred from asserting direct actions\nagainst the insurers,” so too was MacArthur barred be\ncause “in both instances, third parties seek to collect out of\nthe proceeds of Manville’s insurance policies on the basis of\nManville’s conduct.” Id., at 92–93 (emphasis added). The\nCourt of Appeals further held that, because Manville’s\npolicies were property of the bankruptcy estate, the Bank\nruptcy Court had “properly issued the orders pursuant to\nits equitable and statutory powers to dispose of the\ndebtor’s property free and clear of third-party interests\nand to channel those interests to the proceeds thereby\ncreated.” Id., at 91.\n   As the Court of Appeals recognized in the instant pro\nceedings, its earlier interpretation of the Insurance Set\ntlement Order in MacArthur did not and does not extend\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nto the independent actions at issue in the instant suit:\n“Travelers candidly admits that both the statutory and\ncommon law claims seek damages from Travelers that are\nunrelated to the policy proceeds, quite unlike the claims in\nMacArthur . . . where plaintiffs sought indemnification or\ncompensation for the tortious wrongs of Manville to be\npaid out of the proceeds of Manville’s insurance policies.”\nIn re Johns-Manville Corp., 517 F. 3d 52, 63 (CA2 2008).\nAlso in contrast to MacArthur, “the claims at issue here do\nnot seek to collect on the basis of Manville’s conduct. . . .\nInstead, the Plaintiffs seek to recover directly from Trav\nelers, a non-debtor insurer, for its own alleged miscon\nduct.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the 1986 Insur\nance Settlement Order as enjoining only insurer actions\nand not independent actions is further supported by a\nstatutory provision patterned after the Manville settle\nment. In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, Congress\nadopted 11 U. S. C. §524(g) to expressly authorize the\napproach of the Manville bankruptcy in future asbestos\nrelated bankruptcies. In granting bankruptcy courts the\npower to provide injunctive relief to nondebtors, Congress\nstated that courts may bar an action directed against a\nthird party who “is alleged to be directly or indirectly\nliable for the conduct of, claims against, or demands on the\ndebtor to the extent such alleged liability of such third\nparty arises by reason of . . . the third party’s provision of\ninsurance to the debtor or a related party.”\n§524(g)(4)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). As the italicized lan\nguage makes clear, the statute permits a bankruptcy court\nto enjoin actions seeking to proceed against a nondebtor\ninsurer for a debtor’s wrongdoing, but it does not confer\npower to enjoin independent actions arising out of the\ninsurer’s own wrongdoing. See generally In re Combustion\nEngineering, Inc., 391 F. 3d 190, 235, n. 47 (CA3 2004)\n(explaining that §524(g), like the Manville injunction, is\n10          TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v. BAILEY\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlimited to insurer actions). Had Congress interpreted\n“Policy Claims” in the manner the Court does today, and\nhad it sought to codify that definition, it would have used\nbroader language.\n  Finally, it is worth asking why Travelers paid more\nthan $400 million in 2004 to three new settlement funds\nin exchange for the Bankruptcy Court’s order “clarifying”\nthat the independent actions “are—and always have\nbeen—permanently barred” by the 1986 injunction. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 170a. If the 1986 injunction were as clear\nas the Court assumes, surely Travelers would not have\npaid $445 million—more than five times the amount of its\ninitial contribution to the Manville Trust—to obtain a\nredundant piece of paper.\n  In sum, I believe the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order\ndid not enjoin independent actions of the sort giving rise to\nthese proceedings. A contrary conclusion ignores the\nlimits of the Bankruptcy Court’s authority, the Court of\nAppeals’ interpretation of the order upheld on direct re\nview in 1988, Congress’ approval of the Manville reorgani\nzation, and Travelers’ own conduct during both the 1986\nand 2004 settlement negotiations.\n                            III\n  The Court’s holding that respondents’ challenge is an\nimpermissible collateral attack is predicated on its deter\nmination that the 1986 Insurance Settlement Order\nplainly enjoined their independent actions. See ante, at\n13–14. Because I disagree with this premise, I also dis\nagree with the Court’s preclusion analysis. In challenging\nthe Bankruptcy Court’s 2004 order “clarifying” the scope of\nthe Insurance Settlement Order, respondents were in fact\ntimely appealing an order that rewrote the scope of the\n1986 injunctions. Their objection could not have been\nraised on direct appeal of the 1986 order because it was\nnot an objection to anything in that order. And, of course,\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Court of Appeals did not rule on a challenge to the\nenjoining of independent actions during direct review, as\nthe Court acknowledges. See ante, at 14, n. 5. To the\ncontrary, it interpreted the 1986 order as reaching only\ninsurer actions. Thus, there neither was nor reasonably\ncould have been a prior challenge that the 1986 order\nimpermissibly enjoined independent actions.\n   Because the Court regards respondents’ challenge as a\ncollateral attack, it brushes aside their jurisdictional\nobjection to the Bankruptcy Court’s 2004 order on the\nground that “the Bankruptcy Court plainly had jurisdic\ntion to interpret and enforce its own prior orders.” Ante,\nat 13. But neither respondents nor the Court of Appeals\ncontested that point. Rather, respondents argued that the\nBankruptcy Court was not merely interpreting and enforc\ning its prior orders and that it had no jurisdiction to enjoin\nthe independent actions when it approved the 2004 set\ntlements. The Court of Appeals accordingly examined\nwhether the 2004 order improperly expanded the scope of\nthe 1986 injunction and concluded that it did, thereby\nenjoining claims that were beyond the Bankruptcy Court’s\npower to enjoin.\n   In my view, the judgment of the Court of Appeals was\ncorrect. The 1986 Insurance Settlement Order did not bar\nindependent actions, and the Bankruptcy Court lacked\nany basis for enjoining those actions in 2004. The inde\npendent actions have no effect on the bankruptcy estate,\nand “bankruptcy courts have no jurisdiction over proceed\nings that have no effect on the debtor.” Celotex Corp. v.\nEdwards, 514 U. S. 300, 309, n. 6 (1995). The Court of\nAppeals thus correctly concluded that the Bankruptcy\nCourt had impermissibly enjoined “claims against Travel\ners that were predicated, as a matter of state law, on\nTravelers’ own alleged misconduct and were unrelated to\nManville’s insurance policy proceeds and the res of the\nManville estate.” 517 F. 3d, at 68.\n12        TRAVELERS INDEMNITY CO. v.
