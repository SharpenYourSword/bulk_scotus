Miles, Washington, D.C., for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Federal immigration law provides that any \"alien who is convicted of an <i>aggravated felony</i> at any time after admission is deportable.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). A related statute defines \"aggravated felony\" in terms of a set of listed offenses that includes \"an offense that ... involves fraud or deceit <i>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.</i>\" § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (emphasis added). See Appendix A. The question before us is whether the italicized language refers to an element of the fraud or deceit \"offense\" as set forth in the particular fraud or deceit statute defining the offense of which the alien was previously convicted. If so, then in order to determine whether a prior conviction is for the kind of offense described, the immigration judge must look to the criminal fraud or deceit statute to see whether it contains a monetary threshold of $10,000 or more. See <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (so interpreting the Armed Career Criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2298</span> Act). We conclude, however, that the italicized language does not refer to an element of the fraud or deceit crime. Rather it refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a (more broadly defined) fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, an alien, immigrated to the United States in 1985. In 2002 he was indicted for conspiring to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering. 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1341, 1343, 1344, 1956(h). A jury found him guilty. But because none of these statutes requires a finding of any particular amount of victim loss, the jury made no finding about the amount of the loss. At sentencing petitioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 million. The court then imposed a sentence of 41 months in prison and required restitution of $683 million.</p>\n<p>In 2005 the Government, claiming that petitioner had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony,\" sought to remove him from the United States. The Immigration Judge found that petitioner's conviction was for crimes of fraud and deceit; that the sentencing stipulation and restitution order showed that the victims' loss exceeded $10,000; and that petitioner's conviction consequently fell within the immigration statute's \"aggravated felony\" definition. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), (U) (including within the definition of \"aggravated felony\" any \"attempt or conspiracy to commit\" a listed \"offense\"). The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a-51a. So did the Third Circuit. 523 F.3d 387 (2008). The Third Circuit noted that the statutes of conviction were silent as to amounts, but, in its view, the determination of loss amounts for \"aggravated felony\" purposes \"requires an inquiry into the underlying facts of the case.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclusions as to whether the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i) refers to an element of a fraud statute or to the factual circumstances surrounding commission of the crime on a specific occasion. Compare <i>Conteh v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 45, 55 (C.A.1 2006) (fact-based approach); 523 F.3d 387 (same) (case below); <i>Arguelles-Olivares v. Mukasey,</i> 526 F.3d 171, 178 (C.A.5 2008) (same), with <i>Dulal-Whiteway v. United States Dept. of Homeland Security,</i> 501 F.3d 116, 131 (C.A.2 2007) (definitional approach); <i>Kawashima v. Mukasey,</i> 530 F.3d 1111, 1117 (C.A.9 2008) (same); <i>Obasohan v. United States Atty. Gen.,</i> 479 F.3d 785, 791 (C.A.11 2007) (same). We granted certiorari to decide the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The interpretive difficulty before us reflects the linguistic fact that in ordinary speech words such as \"crime,\" \"felony,\" \"offense,\" and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime, say, the crime of fraud or theft in general, and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion, say, <i>the</i> fraud that the defendant planned and executed last month. See <i>Chambers v. United States,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 687, 690-691, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). The question here, as we have said, is whether the italicized statutory words \"offense that involves fraud or deceit <i>in which the loss to the ... victims exceeds $10,000</i>\" should be interpreted in the first sense (which we shall call \"categorical\"), <i>i.e.,</i> as referring to a generic crime, or in the second sense (which we shall call \"circumstance-specific\"), as referring to the specific way in which an offender committed the crime on a specific occasion. If the first, we must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2299</span> look to the statute defining the offense to determine whether it has an appropriate monetary threshold; if the second, we must look to the facts and circumstances underlying an offender's conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The basic argument favoring the first <i>i.e.,</i> the \"generic\" or \"categorical\"interpretation rests upon <i>Taylor, Chambers,</i> and <i>James v. United States,</i> 550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Those cases concerned the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a statute that enhances the sentence imposed upon certain firearm-law offenders who also have three prior convictions for \"a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). See Appendix B, <i>infra.</i> ACCA defines \"violent felony\" to include, first, felonies with elements that involve the use of physical force against another; second, felonies that amount to \"burglary, arson, or extortion\" or that involve the use of explosives; and third, felonies that \"otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" § 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>In <i>Taylor</i> and <i>James</i> we held that ACCA's language read naturally uses the word \"felony\" to refer to a generic crime as <i>generally</i> committed. <i>Chambers, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 690-691 (discussing <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143); <i>James, supra,</i> at 201-202, 127 S.Ct. 1586. The Court noted that such an interpretation of the statute avoids \"the practical difficulty of trying to ascertain\" in a later proceeding, \"perhaps from a paper record\" containing only a citation (say, by number) to a statute and a guilty plea, \"whether the [offender's] prior crime ... did or did not involve,\" say, violence. <i>Chambers, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 690-691.</p>\n<p>Thus in <i>James,</i> referring to <i>Taylor,</i> we made clear that courts must use the \"categorical method\" to determine whether a conviction for \"attempted burglary\" was a conviction for a crime that, in ACCA's language, \"involved conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That method required the court to \"examine, not the unsuccessful burglary the defendant attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.\" <i>Chambers, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 690-691 (discussing <i>James, supra,</i> at 204-206, 127 S.Ct. 1586).</p>\n<p>We also noted that the categorical method is not always easy to apply. That is because sometimes a separately numbered subsection of a criminal statute will refer to several different crimes, each described separately. And it can happen that some of these crimes involve violence while others do not. A single Massachusetts statute section entitled \"Breaking and Entering at Night,\" for example, criminalizes breaking into a \"building, ship, vessel or vehicle.\" Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, § 16 (West 2006). In such an instance, we have said, a court must determine whether an offender's prior conviction was for the violent, rather than the nonviolent, break-ins that this single five-word phrase describes (<i>e.g.,</i> breaking into a building rather than into a vessel), by examining \"the indictment or information and jury instructions,\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, or, if a guilty plea is at issue, by examining the plea agreement, plea colloquy or \"some comparable judicial record\" of the factual basis for the plea. <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that we should interpret the subsection of the \"aggravated felony\" statute before us as requiring use of this same \"categorical\" approach. He says that the statute's language, read naturally as in <i>Taylor,</i> refers to a generic kind of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2300</span> crime, not a crime as committed on a particular occasion. He adds that here, as in <i>Taylor,</i> such a reading avoids the practical difficulty of determining the nature of prior conduct from what may be a brief paper record, perhaps noting only a statutory section number and a guilty plea; or, if there is a more extensive record, combing through that record for evidence of underlying conduct. Also, the categorical approach, since it covers only criminal statutes with a relevant monetary threshold, not only provides assurance of a finding on the point, but also assures that the defendant had an opportunity to present evidence about the amount of loss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Despite petitioner's arguments, we conclude that the \"fraud and deceit\" provision before us calls for a \"circumstance-specific,\" not a \"categorical,\" interpretation. The \"aggravated felony\" statute of which it is a part differs in general from ACCA, the statute at issue in <i>Taylor.</i> And the \"fraud and deceit\" provision differs specifically from ACCA's provisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Consider, first, ACCA in general. That statute defines the \"violent\" felonies it covers to include \"burglary, arson, or extortion\" and \"crime[s]\" that have \"as an element\" the use or threatened use of force. 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). This language refers directly to generic crimes. The statute, however, contains other, more ambiguous language, covering \"crime[s]\" that \"<i>involv[e] conduct</i> that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). While this language poses greater interpretive difficulty, the Court held that it too refers to crimes as generically defined. <i>James, supra,</i> at 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586.</p>\n<p>Now compare the \"aggravated felony\" statute before us. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). We concede that it resembles ACCA in certain respects. The \"aggravated felony\" statute lists several of its \"offenses\" in language that must refer to generic crimes. Subparagraph (A), for example, lists \"murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Estrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey,</i> 546 F.3d 1147, 1152 (C.A.9 2008) (en banc) (applying the categorical approach to \"sexual abuse\"); <i>Singh v. Ashcroft,</i> 383 F.3d 144, 164 (C.A.3 2004) (same); <i>Santos v. Gonzales,</i> 436 F.3d 323, 324 (C.A.2 2005) <i>(per curiam)</i> (same). Subparagraph (B) lists \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\" See <i>Gousse v. Ashcroft,</i> 339 F.3d 91, 95-96 (C.A.2 2003) (applying categorical approach); <i>Fernandez v. Mukasey,</i> 544 F.3d 862, 871-872 (C.A.7 2008) (same); <i>Steele v. Blackman,</i> 236 F.3d 130, 136 (C.A.3 2001) (same). And subparagraph (C) lists \"illicit trafficking in firearms or destructive devices.\" Other sections refer specifically to an \"offense described in\" a particular section of the Federal Criminal Code. See, <i>e.g.,</i> subparagraphs (E), (H), (I), (J), (L).</p>\n<p>More importantly, however, the \"aggravated felony\" statute differs from ACCA in that it lists certain other \"offenses\" using language that almost certainly does not refer to generic crimes but refers to specific circumstances. For example, subparagraph (P), after referring to \"an offense\" that amounts to \"falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport,\" adds, <i>\"except in the case of a first offense for which the alien ... committed the offense for the purpose of assisting... the alien's spouse, child, or parent... to violate a provision of this chapter\"</i> (emphasis added). The language about (for example) \"forging ... passport[s]\" may well refer to a generic crime, but the italicized exception cannot possibly refer to a generic crime. That is because there is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2301</span> no such generic crime; there is no criminal statute that contains any such exception. Thus if the provision is to have any meaning at all, the exception must refer to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed the crime on a particular occasion. See also subparagraph (N) (similar exception).</p>\n<p>The statute has other provisions that contain qualifying language that certainly seems to call for circumstance-specific application. Subparagraph (K)(ii), for example, lists \"offense[s] . . . described in section 2421, 2422, or 2423 of title 18 (relating to transportation for the purpose of prostitution) <i>if committed for commercial advantage</i>\" (emphasis added). Of the three specifically listed criminal statutory sections only one subsection (namely, § 2423(d)) says anything about <i>commercial advantage.</i> Thus, unless the \"commercial advantage\" language calls for circumstance-specific application, the statute's explicit references to §§ 2421 and 2422 would be pointless. But see <i>Gertsenshteyn v. United States Dept. of Justice,</i> 544 F.3d 137, 144-145 (C.A.2 2008).</p>\n<p>Subparagraph (M)(ii) provides yet another example. It refers to an offense \"described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) <i>in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000</i>\" (emphasis added). There is no offense \"described in section 7201 of title 26\" that has a specific loss amount as an element. Again, unless the \"revenue loss\" language calls for circumstance-specific application, the tax-evasion provision would be pointless.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the \"aggravated felony\" statute, unlike ACCA, contains some language that refers to generic crimes and some language that almost certainly refers to the specific circumstances in which a crime was committed. The question before us then is to which category subparagraph (M)(i) belongs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Subparagraph (M)(i) refers to \"an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit <i>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000</i>\" (emphasis added). The language of the provision is consistent with a circumstance-specific approach. The words \"in which\" (which modify \"offense\") can refer to the conduct involved \"<i>in</i>\" the commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements <i>of</i> the offense. Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the internal revenue provision we have just discussed, and it is identical in structure to that provision. Where, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations. <i>IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,</i> 546 U.S. 21, 34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005).</p>\n<p>Moreover, to apply a categorical approach here would leave subparagraph (M)(i) with little, if any, meaningful application. We have found no widely applicable federal fraud statute that contains a relevant monetary loss threshold. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1344 (bank fraud), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 666 (theft in federally funded programs), 1028 (fraud in connection with identification documents), 1029 (fraud in connection with access devices), 1030 (fraud in connection with computers), 1347 (health care fraud), and 1348 (securities fraud). Petitioner has found only three federal fraud statutes that do so, and those three contain thresholds not of $10,000, but of $100,000 or $1 million, §§ 668 (theft by fraud of an artwork worth $100,000 or more), 1031(a) (contract fraud against the United States where the contract is worth at least $1 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2302</span> million), and 1039(d) (providing enhanced penalties for fraud in obtaining telephone records, where the scheme involves more than $100,000). Why would Congress intend subparagraph (M)(i) to apply to only these three federal statutes, and then choose a monetary threshold that, on its face, would apply to other, nonexistent statutes as well?</p>\n<p>We recognize, as petitioner argues, that Congress might have intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply almost exclusively to those who violate certain state fraud and deceit statutes. So we have examined state law. See Appendix C, <i>infra.</i> We have found, however, that in 1996, when Congress added the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i), see Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act § 321(a)(7), 110 Stat. 3009-628, 29 States had no major fraud or deceit statute with any relevant monetary threshold. In 13 of the remaining 21 States, fraud and deceit statutes contain relevant monetary thresholds but with amounts significantly higher than $10,000, leaving only 8 States with statutes in respect to which subparagraph (M)(i)'s $10,000 threshold, as categorically interpreted, would have full effect. We do not believe Congress would have intended (M)(i) to apply in so limited and so haphazard a manner. Cf. <i>United States v. Hayes,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1079, 1087-1088, 172 L.Ed.2d 816 (2009) (reaching similar conclusion for similar reason in respect to a statute referring to crimes involving \"domestic violence\").</p>\n<p>Petitioner next points to 8 U.S.C. § 1326, which criminalizes illegal entry after removal and imposes a higher maximum sentence when an alien's removal was \"subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\" § 1326(b)(2). Petitioner says that a circumstance-specific approach to subparagraph (M)(i) could create potential constitutional problems in a subsequent criminal prosecution under that statute, because loss amount would not have been found beyond a reasonable doubt in the prior criminal proceeding. The Government, however, stated in its brief and at oral argument that the later jury, during the illegal reentry trial, would have to find loss amount beyond a reasonable doubt, Brief for Respondent 49-50; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-40, eliminating any constitutional concern. Cf. <i>Hayes, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 1087.</p>\n<p>We conclude that Congress did not intend subparagraph (M)(i)'s monetary threshold to be applied categorically, <i>i.e.,</i> to only those fraud and deceit crimes generically defined to include that threshold. Rather, the monetary threshold applies to the specific circumstances surrounding an offender's commission of a fraud and deceit crime on a specific occasion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, as an alternative argument, says that we should nonetheless borrow from <i>Taylor</i> what that case called a \"modified categorical approach.\" He says that, for reasons of fairness, we should insist that a jury verdict, or a judge-approved equivalent, embody a determination that the loss involved in a prior fraud or deceit conviction amounted to at least $10,000. To determine whether that is so, petitioner says, the subsequent immigration court applying subparagraph (M)(i) should examine only charging documents, jury instructions, and any special jury finding (if one has been requested). If there was a trial but no jury, the subsequent court should examine the equivalent judge-made findings. If there was a guilty plea (and no trial), the subsequent court should examine the written plea documents or the plea colloquy. To authorize any broader examination of the prior proceedings, petitioner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2303</span> says, would impose an unreasonable administrative burden on immigration judges and would unfairly permit him to be deported on the basis of circumstances that were not before <i>judicially determined</i> to have been present and which he may not have had an opportunity, prior to conviction, to dispute.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that the statute foresees the use of fundamentally fair procedures, including procedures that give an alien a fair opportunity to dispute a Government claim that a prior conviction involved a fraud with the relevant loss to victims. But we do not agree that fairness requires the evidentiary limitations he proposes.</p>\n<p>For one thing, we have found nothing in prior law that so limits the immigration court. <i>Taylor, James,</i> and <i>Shepard,</i> the cases that developed the evidentiary list to which petitioner points, developed that list for a very different purpose, namely that of determining which statutory phrase (contained within a statutory provision that covers several different generic crimes) covered a prior conviction. See <i>supra,</i> at 2299-2300; <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S., at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254. For another, petitioner's proposal itself can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that (given our Part II determination) is not an element of the offense.</p>\n<p>Further, a deportation proceeding is a civil proceeding in which the Government does not have to prove its claim \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" At the same time the evidence that the Government offers must meet a \"clear and convincing\" standard. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). And, as the Government points out, the \"loss\" must \"be tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.\" Brief for Respondent 44; see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Alaka v. Attorney General of United States,</i> 456 F.3d 88, 107 (C.A.3 2006) (loss amount must be tethered to offense of conviction; amount cannot be based on acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct); <i>Knutsen v. Gonzales,</i> 429 F.3d 733, 739-740 (C.A.7 2005) (same). And the Government adds that the \"sole purpose\" of the \"aggravated felony\" inquiry \"is to ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.\" Brief for Respondent 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, the Board of Immigration Appeals, too, has recognized that immigration judges must assess findings made at sentencing \"with an eye to what losses are covered and to the burden of proof employed.\" <i>In re Babaisakov,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 306, 319 (2007).</p>\n<p>These considerations, taken together, mean that petitioner and those in similar circumstances have at least one and possibly two opportunities to contest the amount of loss, the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing itself. They also mean that, since the Government must show the amount of loss by clear and convincing evidence, uncertainties caused by the passage of time are likely to count in the alien's favor.</p>\n<p>We can find nothing unfair about the immigration judge's having here relied upon earlier sentencing-related material. The defendant's own stipulation, produced for sentencing purposes, shows that the conviction involved losses considerably greater than $10,000. The court's restitution order shows the same.

Miles, Washington, D.C., for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Federal immigration law provides that any \"alien who is convicted of an <i>aggravated felony</i> at any time after admission is deportable.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). A related statute defines \"aggravated felony\" in terms of a set of listed offenses that includes \"an offense that ... involves fraud or deceit <i>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.</i>\" § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (emphasis added). See Appendix A. The question before us is whether the italicized language refers to an element of the fraud or deceit \"offense\" as set forth in the particular fraud or deceit statute defining the offense of which the alien was previously convicted. If so, then in order to determine whether a prior conviction is for the kind of offense described, the immigration judge must look to the criminal fraud or deceit statute to see whether it contains a monetary threshold of $10,000 or more. See <i>Taylor v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (so interpreting the Armed Career Criminal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2298</span> Act). We conclude, however, that the italicized language does not refer to an element of the fraud or deceit crime. Rather it refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a (more broadly defined) fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, an alien, immigrated to the United States in 1985. In 2002 he was indicted for conspiring to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering. 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1341, 1343, 1344, 1956(h). A jury found him guilty. But because none of these statutes requires a finding of any particular amount of victim loss, the jury made no finding about the amount of the loss. At sentencing petitioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 million. The court then imposed a sentence of 41 months in prison and required restitution of $683 million.</p>\n<p>In 2005 the Government, claiming that petitioner had been convicted of an \"aggravated felony,\" sought to remove him from the United States. The Immigration Judge found that petitioner's conviction was for crimes of fraud and deceit; that the sentencing stipulation and restitution order showed that the victims' loss exceeded $10,000; and that petitioner's conviction consequently fell within the immigration statute's \"aggravated felony\" definition. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), (U) (including within the definition of \"aggravated felony\" any \"attempt or conspiracy to commit\" a listed \"offense\").

We granted certiorari to decide the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The interpretive difficulty before us reflects the linguistic fact that in ordinary speech words such as \"crime,\" \"felony,\" \"offense,\" and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime, say, the crime of fraud or theft in general, and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion, say, <i>the</i> fraud that the defendant planned and executed last month. See <i>Chambers v. United States,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 687, 690-691, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). The question here, as we have said, is whether the italicized statutory words \"offense that involves fraud or deceit <i>in which the loss to the ... victims exceeds $10,000</i>\" should be interpreted in the first sense (which we shall call \"categorical\"), <i>i.e.,</i> as referring to a generic crime, or in the second sense (which we shall call \"circumstance-specific\"), as referring to the specific way in which an offender committed the crime on a specific occasion. If the first, we must <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2299</span> look to the statute defining the offense to determine whether it has an appropriate monetary threshold; if the second, we must look to the facts and circumstances underlying an offender's conviction.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The basic argument favoring the first <i>i.e.,</i> the \"generic\" or \"categorical\"interpretation rests upon <i>Taylor, Chambers,</i> and <i>James v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145743\"><a href=\"/opinion/145743/james-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Those cases concerned the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), a statute that enhances the sentence imposed upon certain firearm-law offenders who also have three prior convictions for \"a violent felony.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). See Appendix B, <i>infra.</i> ACCA defines \"violent felony\" to include, first, felonies with elements that involve the use of physical force against another; second, felonies that amount to \"burglary, arson, or extortion\" or that involve the use of explosives; and third, felonies that \"otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" § 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>In <i>Taylor</i> and <i>James</i> we held that ACCA's language read naturally uses the word \"felony\" to refer to a generic crime as <i>generally</i> committed. <i>Chambers, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 690-691 (discussing <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143); <i>James, supra,</i> at 201-202, 127 S.Ct. 1586. The Court noted that such an interpretation of the statute avoids \"the practical difficulty of trying to ascertain\" in a later proceeding, \"perhaps from a paper record\" containing only a citation (say, by number) to a statute and a guilty plea, \"whether the [offender's] prior crime ... did or did not involve,\" say, violence. <i>Chambers, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 690-691.</p>\n<p>Thus in <i>James,</i> referring to <i>Taylor,</i> we made clear that courts must use the \"categorical method\" to determine whether a conviction for \"attempted burglary\" was a conviction for a crime that, in ACCA's language, \"involved conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That method required the court to \"examine, not the unsuccessful burglary the defendant attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.\" <i>Chambers, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 690-691 (discussing <i>James, supra,</i> at 204-206, 127 S.Ct. 1586).</p>\n<p>We also noted that the categorical method is not always easy to apply. That is because sometimes a separately numbered subsection of a criminal statute will refer to several different crimes, each described separately. And it can happen that some of these crimes involve violence while others do not. A single Massachusetts statute section entitled \"Breaking and Entering at Night,\" for example, criminalizes breaking into a \"building, ship, vessel or vehicle.\" Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, § 16 (West 2006). In such an instance, we have said, a court must determine whether an offender's prior conviction was for the violent, rather than the nonviolent, break-ins that this single five-word phrase describes (<i>e.g.,</i> breaking into a building rather than into a vessel), by examining \"the indictment or information and jury instructions,\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, or, if a guilty plea is at issue, by examining the plea agreement, plea colloquy or \"some comparable judicial record\" of the factual basis for the plea. <i>Shepard v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142875\"><a href=\"/opinion/142875/shepard-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that we should interpret the subsection of the \"aggravated felony\" statute before us as requiring use of this same \"categorical\" approach. He says that the statute's language, read naturally as in <i>Taylor,</i> refers to a generic kind of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2300</span> crime, not a crime as committed on a particular occasion. He adds that here, as in <i>Taylor,</i> such a reading avoids the practical difficulty of determining the nature of prior conduct from what may be a brief paper record, perhaps noting only a statutory section number and a guilty plea; or, if there is a more extensive record, combing through that record for evidence of underlying conduct. Also, the categorical approach, since it covers only criminal statutes with a relevant monetary threshold, not only provides assurance of a finding on the point, but also assures that the defendant had an opportunity to present evidence about the amount of loss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Despite petitioner's arguments, we conclude that the \"fraud and deceit\" provision before us calls for a \"circumstance-specific,\" not a \"categorical,\" interpretation. The \"aggravated felony\" statute of which it is a part differs in general from ACCA, the statute at issue in <i>Taylor.</i> And the \"fraud and deceit\" provision differs specifically from ACCA's provisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>Consider, first, ACCA in general. That statute defines the \"violent\" felonies it covers to include \"burglary, arson, or extortion\" and \"crime[s]\" that have \"as an element\" the use or threatened use of force. 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). This language refers directly to generic crimes. The statute, however, contains other, more ambiguous language, covering \"crime[s]\" that \"<i>involv[e] conduct</i> that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added). While this language poses greater interpretive difficulty, the Court held that it too refers to crimes as generically defined. <i>James, supra,</i> at 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586.</p>\n<p>Now compare the \"aggravated felony\" statute before us. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). We concede that it resembles ACCA in certain respects. The \"aggravated felony\" statute lists several of its \"offenses\" in language that must refer to generic crimes. Subparagraph (A), for example, lists \"murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Estrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1361998\"><a href=\"/opinion/1361998/estrada-espinoza-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1147</span></a></span>, 1152 (C.A.9 2008) (en banc) (applying the categorical approach to \"sexual abuse\"); <i>Singh v.

Subparagraph (B) lists \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\" See <i>Gousse v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783044\"><a href=\"/opinion/783044/roger-g-gousse-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 95-96 (C.A.2 2003) (applying categorical approach); <i>Fernandez v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1313782\"><a href=\"/opinion/1313782/fernandez-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></a></span>, 871-872 (C.A.7 2008) (same); <i>Steele v. Blackman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771578\"><a href=\"/opinion/771578/gary-steele-v-j-scott-blackman-ins-district-direct/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 136 (C.A.3 2001) (same). And subparagraph (C) lists \"illicit trafficking in firearms or destructive devices.\" Other sections refer specifically to an \"offense described in\" a particular section of the Federal Criminal Code. See, <i>e.g.,</i> subparagraphs (E), (H), (I), (J), (L).</p>\n<p>More importantly, however, the \"aggravated felony\" statute differs from ACCA in that it lists certain other \"offenses\" using language that almost certainly does not refer to generic crimes but refers to specific circumstances. For example, subparagraph (P), after referring to \"an offense\" that amounts to \"falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport,\" adds, <i>\"except in the case of a first offense for which the alien ... committed the offense for the purpose of assisting... the alien's spouse, child, or parent... to violate a provision of this chapter\"</i> (emphasis added). The language about (for example) \"forging ... passport[s]\" may well refer to a generic crime, but the italicized exception cannot possibly refer to a generic crime. That is because there is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2301</span> no such generic crime; there is no criminal statute that contains any such exception. Thus if the provision is to have any meaning at all, the exception must refer to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed the crime on a particular occasion. See also subparagraph (N) (similar exception).</p>\n<p>The statute has other provisions that contain qualifying language that certainly seems to call for circumstance-specific application. Subparagraph (K)(ii), for example, lists \"offense[s] . . . described in section 2421, 2422, or 2423 of title 18 (relating to transportation for the purpose of prostitution) <i>if committed for commercial advantage</i>\" (emphasis added). Of the three specifically listed criminal statutory sections only one subsection (namely, § 2423(d)) says anything about <i>commercial advantage.</i> Thus, unless the \"commercial advantage\" language calls for circumstance-specific application, the statute's explicit references to §§ 2421 and 2422 would be pointless. But see <i>Gertsenshteyn v. United States Dept. of Justice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1314522\"><a href=\"/opinion/1314522/gertsenshteyn-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 144-145 (C.A.2 2008).</p>\n<p>Subparagraph (M)(ii) provides yet another example. It refers to an offense \"described in section 7201 of title 26 (relating to tax evasion) <i>in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000</i>\" (emphasis added). There is no offense \"described in section 7201 of title 26\" that has a specific loss amount as an element. Again, unless the \"revenue loss\" language calls for circumstance-specific application, the tax-evasion provision would be pointless.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the \"aggravated felony\" statute, unlike ACCA, contains some language that refers to generic crimes and some language that almost certainly refers to the specific circumstances in which a crime was committed. The question before us then is to which category subparagraph (M)(i) belongs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Subparagraph (M)(i) refers to \"an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit <i>in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000</i>\" (emphasis added). The language of the provision is consistent with a circumstance-specific approach. The words \"in which\" (which modify \"offense\") can refer to the conduct involved \"<i>in</i>\" the commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements <i>of</i> the offense. Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the internal revenue provision we have just discussed, and it is identical in structure to that provision. Where, as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpretations. <i>IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1991818\"><a href=\"/opinion/1991818/ibp-inc-v-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005).</p>\n<p>Moreover, to apply a categorical approach here would leave subparagraph (M)(i) with little, if any, meaningful application. We have found no widely applicable federal fraud statute that contains a relevant monetary loss threshold. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341 (mail fraud), 1343 (wire fraud), 1344 (bank fraud), 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United States), 666 (theft in federally funded programs), 1028 (fraud in connection with identification documents), 1029 (fraud in connection with access devices), 1030 (fraud in connection with computers), 1347 (health care fraud), and 1348 (securities fraud). Petitioner has found only three federal fraud statutes that do so, and those three contain thresholds not of $10,000, but of $100,000 or $1 million, §§ 668 (theft by fraud of an artwork worth $100,000 or more), 1031(a) (contract fraud against the United States where the contract is worth at least $1 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2302</span> million), and 1039(d) (providing enhanced penalties for fraud in obtaining telephone records, where the scheme involves more than $100,000). Why would Congress intend subparagraph (M)(i) to apply to only these three federal statutes, and then choose a monetary threshold that, on its face, would apply to other, nonexistent statutes as well?</p>\n<p>We recognize, as petitioner argues, that Congress might have intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply almost exclusively to those who violate certain state fraud and deceit statutes. So we have examined state law. See Appendix C, <i>infra.</i> We have found, however, that in 1996, when Congress added the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i), see Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act § 321(a)(7), 110 Stat. 3009-628, 29 States had no major fraud or deceit statute with any relevant monetary threshold. In 13 of the remaining 21 States, fraud and deceit statutes contain relevant monetary thresholds but with amounts significantly higher than $10,000, leaving only 8 States with statutes in respect to which subparagraph (M)(i)'s $10,000 threshold, as categorically interpreted, would have full effect. We do not believe Congress would have intended (M)(i) to apply in so limited and so haphazard a manner. Cf. <i>United States v. Hayes,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 1079, 1087-1088, 172 L.Ed.2d 816 (2009) (reaching similar conclusion for similar reason in respect to a statute referring to crimes involving \"domestic violence\").</p>\n<p>Petitioner next points to 8 U.S.C. § 1326, which criminalizes illegal entry after removal and imposes a higher maximum sentence when an alien's removal was \"subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\" § 1326(b)(2). Petitioner says that a circumstance-specific approach to subparagraph (M)(i) could create potential constitutional problems in a subsequent criminal prosecution under that statute, because loss amount would not have been found beyond a reasonable doubt in the prior criminal proceeding. The Government, however, stated in its brief and at oral argument that the later jury, during the illegal reentry trial, would have to find loss amount beyond a reasonable doubt, Brief for Respondent 49-50; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-40, eliminating any constitutional concern. Cf. <i>Hayes, supra,</i> at ___, 129 S.Ct., at 1087.</p>\n<p>We conclude that Congress did not intend subparagraph (M)(i)'s monetary threshold to be applied categorically, <i>i.e.,</i> to only those fraud and deceit crimes generically defined to include that threshold. Rather, the monetary threshold applies to the specific circumstances surrounding an offender's commission of a fraud and deceit crime on a specific occasion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Petitioner, as an alternative argument, says that we should nonetheless borrow from <i>Taylor</i> what that case called a \"modified categorical approach.\" He says that, for reasons of fairness, we should insist that a jury verdict, or a judge-approved equivalent, embody a determination that the loss involved in a prior fraud or deceit conviction amounted to at least $10,000. To determine whether that is so, petitioner says, the subsequent immigration court applying subparagraph (M)(i) should examine only charging documents, jury instructions, and any special jury finding (if one has been requested). If there was a trial but no jury, the subsequent court should examine the equivalent judge-made findings. If there was a guilty plea (and no trial), the subsequent court should examine the written plea documents or the plea colloquy. To authorize any broader examination of the prior proceedings, petitioner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2303</span> says, would impose an unreasonable administrative burden on immigration judges and would unfairly permit him to be deported on the basis of circumstances that were not before <i>judicially determined</i> to have been present and which he may not have had an opportunity, prior to conviction, to dispute.</p>\n<p>We agree with petitioner that the statute foresees the use of fundamentally fair procedures, including procedures that give an alien a fair opportunity to dispute a Government claim that a prior conviction involved a fraud with the relevant loss to victims. But we do not agree that fairness requires the evidentiary limitations he proposes.</p>\n<p>For one thing, we have found nothing in prior law that so limits the immigration court. <i>Taylor, James,</i> and <i>Shepard,</i> the cases that developed the evidentiary list to which petitioner points, developed that list for a very different purpose, namely that of determining which statutory phrase (contained within a statutory provision that covers several different generic crimes) covered a prior conviction. See <i>supra,</i> at 2299-2300; <i>Taylor,</i> 495 U.S., at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143; <i>Shepard,</i> 544 U.S., at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254. For another, petitioner's proposal itself can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that (given our Part II determination) is not an element of the offense.</p>\n<p>Further, a deportation proceeding is a civil proceeding in which the Government does not have to prove its claim \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" At the same time the evidence that the Government offers must meet a \"clear and convincing\" standard. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A). And, as the Government points out, the \"loss\" must \"be tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.\" Brief for Respondent 44; see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Alaka v. Attorney General of United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795163\"><a href=\"/opinion/795163/oyenike-alaka-v-attorney-general-of-the-united-sta/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 107 (C.A.3 2006) (loss amount must be tethered to offense of conviction; amount cannot be based on acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct); <i>Knutsen v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792488\"><a href=\"/opinion/792488/jon-knutsen-v-alberto-r-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 739-740 (C.A.7 2005) (same). And the Government adds that the \"sole purpose\" of the \"aggravated felony\" inquiry \"is to ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.\" Brief for Respondent 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, the Board of Immigration Appeals, too, has recognized that immigration judges must assess findings made at sentencing \"with an eye to what losses are covered and to the burden of proof employed.\" <i>In re Babaisakov,</i> 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 306, 319 (2007).</p>\n<p>These considerations, taken together, mean that petitioner and those in similar circumstances have at least one and possibly two opportunities to contest the amount of loss, the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing itself. They also mean that, since the Government must show the amount of loss by clear and convincing evidence, uncertainties caused by the passage of time are likely to count in the alien's favor.</p>\n<p>We can find nothing unfair about the immigration judge's having here relied upon earlier sentencing-related material. The defendant's own stipulation, produced for sentencing purposes, shows that the conviction involved losses considerably greater than $10,000. The court's restitution order shows the same. In the absence of any conflicting evidence (and petitioner mentions none), this evidence is clear and convincing.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner's prior federal conviction consequently <span class=\"star-pagination\">*2304</span> falls within the scope of subparagraph (M)(i).

HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08–495.      Argued April 27, 2009—Decided June 15, 2009\nAn alien “convicted of an aggravated felony any time after admission is\n deportable.” 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). An “aggravated felony” in\n cludes “an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss\n to the . . . victims exceeds $10,000.” §1101(a)(43)(M)(i). Petitioner,\n an alien, was convicted of conspiring to commit mail fraud and re\n lated crimes. Because the relevant statutes did not require a finding\n of loss, the jury made no such finding. However, at sentencing, peti\n tioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 million. He was sen\n tenced to prison and required to make $683 million in restitution.\n The Government subsequently sought to remove him from the United\n States, claiming that he had been convicted of an “aggravated fel\n ony.” The Immigration Judge found that petitioner’s conviction fell\n within the “aggravated felony” definition. The Board of Immigration\n Appeals agreed, as did the Third Circuit, which held that the Immi\n gration Judge could inquire into the underlying facts of a prior fraud\n conviction for purposes of determining whether the loss to the victims\n exceeded $10,000.\nHeld: Subparagraph (M)(i)’s $10,000 threshold refers to the particular\n circumstances in which an offender committed a fraud or deceit crime\n on a particular occasion rather than to an element of the fraud or de\n ceit crime. Pp. 3–13.\n    (a) Words such as “crime,” “felony, and “offense” sometimes refer to\n a generic crime (a “categorical” interpretation), and sometimes refer\n to the specific acts in which an offender engaged (“circumstance\n specific” interpretation). The basic argument favoring the “categori\n cal” interpretation rests upon Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n Chambers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___, and James v. United\n States, 550 U. S. 192. These cases concerned the Armed Career\n2                          NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER\n\n                                     Syllabus\n\n    Criminal Act (ACCA), which enhances the sentence for firearm-law\n    offenders who have prior “violent felony” convictions, 18 U. S. C.\n    §924(e). The Court held that the word “felony” refers to a generic\n    crime as generally committed. Thus, for example, in James, the\n    Court applied the “categorical method” to determine whether an “at\n    tempted burglary” was a “violent felony.” That method required the\n    Court to examine “not the unsuccessful burglary . . . attempted on a\n    particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.”\n    550 U. S., at 204–206. Pp. 3–5.\n        (b) Contrary to petitioner’s arguments, the “$10,000 loss” provision\n    at issue calls for a “circumstance-specific” interpretation, not a “cate\n    gorical” one. The “aggravated felony” statute of which it is a part dif\n    fers from ACCA in general, and the “$10,000 loss” provision differs\n    specifically from ACCA’s provisions. Pp. 6–10.\n           (1) The “aggravated felony” statute at issue resembles ACCA\n    when it lists several “offenses” in language that must refer to generic\n    crimes. But other “offenses” are listed using language that almost\n    certainly refers to specific circumstances.                 Title 8 U. S. C.\n    §1101(a)(43)(P), for example, after referring to “an offense” that\n    amounts to “falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or al\n    tering a passport,” adds, “except in the case of a first offense for\n    which . . . the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting\n    . . . the alien’s spouse, child, or parent . . . to violate a provision of this\n    chapter.” The language about “forging . . . passport[s]” may well refer\n    to a generic crime, but the exception cannot possibly refer to a generic\n    crime, because there is no criminal statute that contains any such ex\n    ception. Subparagraph (M)(ii), which refers to an offense “described\n    in [26 U. S. C. §7201] (relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue\n    loss to the government exceeds $10,000,” provides another example.\n    Because no §7201 offense has a specific loss amount as an element,\n    the tax-evasion provision would be pointless, unless the “revenue\n    loss” language calls for circumstance-specific application. Here, the\n    question is to which category subparagraph (M)(i) belongs. Pp. 6–8.\n           (2) Subparagraph (M)(i)’s language is consistent with a circum\n    stance-specific approach. The words “in which” (modifying “offense”)\n    can refer to the conduct involved “in” the commission of the offense of\n    conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense. Moreover,\n    subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the\n    tax-evasion provision, and their structures are identical. Where, as\n    here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory\n    structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar in\n    terpretations. IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34. Additionally,\n    applying a categorical approach would leave subparagraph (M)(i)\n    with little, if any, meaningful application. Only three federal fraud\n                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  statutes appear to contain a relevant monetary loss threshold. And\n  at the time the $10,000 threshold was added, only eight States had\n  fraud and deceit statutes in respect to which that threshold, as cate\n  gorically interpreted, would have full effect. Congress is unlikely to\n  have intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply in such a limited and\n  haphazard manner. Pp. 8–10.\n     (c) This Court rejects petitioner’s alternative position that fairness\n  calls for a “modified categorical approach” requiring a jury verdict or\n  a judge-approved equivalent to embody a loss-amount determination,\n  and permitting the subsequent immigration court applying subpara\n  graph (M)(i) to examine only charging documents, jury instructions,\n  and any special jury finding, or their equivalents. The Court’s cases\n  developed the evidentiary list to which petitioner points for a very\n  different purpose, namely, to determine which statutory phrase (con\n  tained within a statutory provision covering several different generic\n  crimes) covered a prior conviction. Additionally, petitioner’s proposal\n  can prove impractical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a\n  special verdict on a fact that is not an element of the offense. Fur\n  ther, evidence of loss offered by the Government must meet a “clear\n  and convincing” standard and the loss must be tied to the specific\n  counts covered by the conviction. These considerations mean that pe\n  titioner and others in similar circumstances have at least one and\n  possibly two opportunities to contest the loss amount, the first at the\n  earlier sentencing and the second at the deportation hearing. There\n  was nothing unfair about the Immigration Judge’s reliance on earlier\n  sentencing-related material here. The defendant’s sentencing stipu\n  lation and the court’s restitution order show that the conviction in\n  volved losses considerably greater than $10,000. Absent any conflict\n  ing evidence, this evidence is clear and convincing.

S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis\nadded). A related statute defines “aggravated felony” in\nterms of a set of listed offenses that includes “an offense\nthat . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the\nvictim or victims exceeds $10,000.” §1101(a)(43)(M)(i)\n(emphasis added). See Appendix A. The question before\nus is whether the italicized language refers to an element\nof the fraud or deceit “offense” as set forth in the particu\nlar fraud or deceit statute defining the offense of which the\nalien was previously convicted. If so, then in order to\ndetermine whether a prior conviction is for the kind of\noffense described, the immigration judge must look to the\ncriminal fraud or deceit statute to see whether it contains\na monetary threshold of $10,000 or more. See Taylor v.\nUnited States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990) (so interpreting the\nArmed Career Criminal Act). We conclude, however, that\nthe italicized language does not refer to an element of the\nfraud or deceit crime. Rather it refers to the particular\n2                  NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances in which an offender committed a (more\nbroadly defined) fraud or deceit crime on a particular\noccasion.\n                              I\n   Petitioner, an alien, immigrated to the United States in\n1985. In 2002 he was indicted for conspiring to commit\nmail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering.\n18 U. S. C. §§371, 1341, 1343, 1344, 1956(h). A jury found\nhim guilty. But because none of these statutes requires a\nfinding of any particular amount of victim loss, the jury\nmade no finding about the amount of the loss. At sentenc\ning petitioner stipulated that the loss exceeded $100 mil\nlion. The court then imposed a sentence of 41 months in\nprison and required restitution of $683 million.\n   In 2005 the Government, claiming that petitioner had\nbeen convicted of an “aggravated felony,” sought to remove\nhim from the United States. The Immigration Judge\nfound that petitioner’s conviction was for crimes of fraud\nand deceit; that the sentencing stipulation and restitution\norder showed that the victims’ loss exceeded $10,000; and\nthat petitioner’s conviction consequently fell within the\nimmigration statute’s “aggravated felony” definition. See\n8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(M)(i), (U) (including within the\ndefinition of “aggravated felony” any “attempt or conspir\nacy to commit” a listed “offense”). The Board of Immigra\ntion Appeals agreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a–51a. So\ndid the Third Circuit. 523 F. 3d 387 (2008). The Third\nCircuit noted that the statutes of conviction were silent as\nto amounts, but, in its view, the determination of loss\namounts for “aggravated felony” purposes “requires an\ninquiry into the underlying facts of the case.” Id., at 396\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclu\nsions as to whether the $10,000 threshold in subpara\ngraph (M)(i) refers to an element of a fraud statute or to\n                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthe factual circumstances surrounding commission of the\ncrime on a specific occasion. Compare Conteh v. Gonzales,\n461 F. 3d 45, 55 (CA1 2006) (fact-based approach); 523\nF. 3d 387 (same) (case below); Arguelles-Olivares v. Mu\nkasey, 526 F. 3d 171, 178 (CA5 2008) (same), with Dulal-\nWhiteway v. United States Dept. of Homeland Security,\n501 F. 3d 116, 131 (CA2 2007) (definitional approach);\nKawashima v. Mukasey, 530 F. 3d 1111, 1117 (CA9 2008)\n(same); Obasohan v. United States Atty. Gen., 479 F. 3d\n785, 791 (CA11 2007) (same). We granted certiorari to\ndecide the question.\n                                 II\n   The interpretive difficulty before us reflects the linguis\ntic fact that in ordinary speech words such as “crime,”\n“felony, “offense,” and the like sometimes refer to a generic\ncrime, say, the crime of fraud or theft in general, and\nsometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender\nengaged on a specific occasion, say, the fraud that the\ndefendant planned and executed last month. See Cham\nbers v. United States, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n3). The question here, as we have said, is whether the\nitalicized statutory words “offense that involves fraud or\ndeceit in which the loss to the . . . victims exceeds $10,000”\nshould be interpreted in the first sense (which we shall\ncall “categorical”), i.e., as referring to a generic crime, or in\nthe second sense (which we shall call “circumstance\nspecific”), as referring to the specific way in which an\noffender committed the crime on a specific occasion. If the\nfirst, we must look to the statute defining the offense to\ndetermine whether it has an appropriate monetary\nthreshold; if the second, we must look to the facts and\ncircumstances underlying an offender’s conviction.\n                           A\n  The basic argument favoring the first—i.e., the “generic”\n4                   NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nor “categorical”—interpretation rests upon Taylor, Cham\nbers, and James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192 (2007).\nThose cases concerned the Armed Career Criminal Act\n(ACCA), a statute that enhances the sentence imposed\nupon certain firearm-law offenders who also have three\nprior convictions for “a violent felony.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e).\nSee Appendix B, infra. ACCA defines “violent felony” to\ninclude, first, felonies with elements that involve the use\nof physical force against another; second, felonies that\namount to “burglary, arson, or extortion” or that involve\nthe use of explosives; and third, felonies that “otherwise\ninvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B).\n   In Taylor and James we held that ACCA’s language\nread naturally uses the word “felony” to refer to a generic\ncrime as generally committed. Chambers, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 3) (discussing Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602);\nJames, supra, at 201–202. The Court noted that such an\ninterpretation of the statute avoids “the practical difficulty\nof trying to ascertain” in a later proceeding, “perhaps from\na paper record” containing only a citation (say, by number)\nto a statute and a guilty plea, “whether the [offender’s]\nprior crime . . . did or did not involve,” say, violence.\nChambers, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3).\n   Thus in James, referring to Taylor, we made clear that\ncourts must use the “categorical method” to determine\nwhether a conviction for “attempted burglary” was a con\nviction for a crime that, in ACCA’s language, “involved\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That method re\nquired the court to “examine, not the unsuccessful bur\nglary the defendant attempted on a particular occasion,\nbut the generic crime of attempted burglary.” Chambers,\nsupra, at (slip op., at 3) (discussing James, supra, at 204–\n206).\n   We also noted that the categorical method is not always\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neasy to apply. That is because sometimes a separately\nnumbered subsection of a criminal statute will refer to\nseveral different crimes, each described separately. And it\ncan happen that some of these crimes involve violence\nwhile others do not. A single Massachusetts statute sec\ntion entitled “Breaking and Entering at Night,” for exam\nple, criminalizes breaking into a “building, ship, vessel or\nvehicle.” Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, §16 (West 2006). In\nsuch an instance, we have said, a court must determine\nwhether an offender’s prior conviction was for the violent,\nrather than the nonviolent, break-ins that this single five\nword phrase describes (e.g., breaking into a building\nrather than into a vessel), by examining “the indictment or\ninformation and jury instructions,” Taylor, supra, at 602,\nor, if a guilty plea is at issue, by examining the plea\nagreement, plea colloquy or “some comparable judicial\nrecord” of the factual basis for the plea. Shepard v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005).\n   Petitioner argues that we should interpret the subsec\ntion of the “aggravated felony” statute before us as requir\ning use of this same “categorical” approach. He says that\nthe statute’s language, read naturally as in Taylor, refers\nto a generic kind of crime, not a crime as committed on a\nparticular occasion. He adds that here, as in Taylor, such\na reading avoids the practical difficulty of determining the\nnature of prior conduct from what may be a brief paper\nrecord, perhaps noting only a statutory section number\nand a guilty plea; or, if there is a more extensive record,\ncombing through that record for evidence of underlying\nconduct. Also, the categorical approach, since it covers\nonly criminal statutes with a relevant monetary threshold,\nnot only provides assurance of a finding on the point, but\nalso assures that the defendant had an opportunity to\npresent evidence about the amount of loss.\n6                   NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             B\n\n   Despite petitioner’s arguments, we conclude that the\n“fraud and deceit” provision before us calls for a “circum\nstance-specific,” not a “categorical,” interpretation. The\n“aggravated felony” statute of which it is a part differs in\ngeneral from ACCA, the statute at issue in Taylor. And\nthe “fraud and deceit” provision differs specifically from\nACCA’s provisions.\n                                1\n   Consider, first, ACCA in general. That statute defines\nthe “violent” felonies it covers to include “burglary, arson,\nor extortion” and “crime[s]” that have “as an element” the\nuse or threatened use of force. 18 U. S. C. §§924(e)(2)\n(B)(i)–(ii). This language refers directly to generic crimes.\nThe statute, however, contains other, more ambiguous\nlanguage, covering “crime[s]” that “involv[e] conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.” Ibid. (emphasis added). While this language\nposes greater interpretive difficulty, the Court held that it\ntoo refers to crimes as generically defined. James, supra,\nat 202.\n   Now compare the “aggravated felony” statute before us.\n8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43). We concede that it resembles\nACCA in certain respects. The “aggravated felony” statute\nlists several of its “offenses” in language that must refer to\ngeneric crimes. Subparagraph (A), for example, lists\n“murder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.” See, e.g.,\nEstrada-Espinoza v. Mukasey, 546 F. 3d 1147, 1152 (CA9\n2008) (en banc) (applying the categorical approach to\n“sexual abuse”); Singh v. Ashcroft, 383 F. 3d 144, 164 (CA3\n2004) (same); Santos v. Gonzales, 436 F. 3d 323, 324 (CA2\n2005) (per curiam) (same). Subparagraph (B) lists “illicit\ntrafficking in a controlled substance.” See Gousse v.\nAshcroft, 339 F. 3d 91, 95–96 (CA2 2003) (applying cate\ngorical approach); Fernandez v. Mukasey, 544 F. 3d 862,\n                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n871–872 (CA7 2008) (same); Steele v. Blackman, 236 F. 3d\n130, 136 (CA3 2001) (same). And subparagraph (C) lists\n“illicit trafficking in firearms or destructive devices.”\nOther sections refer specifically to an “offense described\nin” a particular section of the Federal Criminal Code. See,\ne.g., subparagraphs (E), (H), (I), (J), (L).\n   More importantly, however, the “aggravated felony”\nstatute differs from ACCA in that it lists certain other\n“offenses” using language that almost certainly does not\nrefer to generic crimes but refers to specific circumstances.\nFor example, subparagraph (P), after referring to “an\noffense” that amounts to “falsely making, forging, counter\nfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport,” adds, “except in\nthe case of a first offense for which the alien . . . committed\nthe offense for the purpose of assisting . . . the alien’s\nspouse, child, or parent . . . to violate a provision of this\nchapter” (emphasis added). The language about (for ex\nample) “forging . . . passport[s]” may well refer to a generic\ncrime, but the italicized exception cannot possibly refer to\na generic crime. That is because there is no such generic\ncrime; there is no criminal statute that contains any such\nexception. Thus if the provision is to have any meaning at\nall, the exception must refer to the particular circum\nstances in which an offender committed the crime on a\nparticular occasion. See also subparagraph (N) (similar\nexception).\n   The statute has other provisions that contain qualifying\nlanguage that certainly seems to call for circumstance\nspecific application. Subparagraph (K)(ii), for example,\nlists “offense[s] . . . described in section 2421, 2422, or\n2423 of title 18 (relating to transportation for the purpose\nof prostitution) if committed for commercial advantage”\n(emphasis added). Of the three specifically listed criminal\nstatutory sections only one subsection (namely, §2423(d))\nsays anything about commercial advantage. Thus, unless\nthe “commercial advantage” language calls for circum\n8                   NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstance-specific application, the statute’s explicit references\nto §§2421 and 2422 would be pointless. But see Gertsen\nshteyn v. United States Dept. of Justice, 544 F. 3d 137,\n144–145 (CA2 2008).\n  Subparagraph (M)(ii) provides yet another example. It\nrefers to an offense “described in section 7201 of title 26\n(relating to tax evasion) in which the revenue loss to the\nGovernment exceeds $10,000” (emphasis added). There is\nno offense “described in section 7201 of title 26” that has a\nspecific loss amount as an element. Again, unless the\n“revenue loss” language calls for circumstance-specific\napplication, the tax-evasion provision would be pointless.\n  The upshot is that the “aggravated felony” statute,\nunlike ACCA, contains some language that refers to ge\nneric crimes and some language that almost certainly\nrefers to the specific circumstances in which a crime was\ncommitted. The question before us then is to which cate\ngory subparagraph (M)(i) belongs.\n                              2\n  Subparagraph (M)(i) refers to “an offense that . . . in\nvolves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $10,000” (emphasis added). The language\nof the provision is consistent with a circumstance-specific\napproach. The words “in which” (which modify “offense”)\ncan refer to the conduct involved “in” the commission of\nthe offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of\nthe offense. Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just\nprior to subparagraph (M)(ii), the internal revenue provi\nsion we have just discussed, and it is identical in structure\nto that provision. Where, as here, Congress uses similar\nstatutory language and similar statutory structure in two\nadjoining provisions, it normally intends similar interpre\ntations. IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005).\n  Moreover, to apply a categorical approach here would\nleave subparagraph (M)(i) with little, if any, meaningful\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napplication. We have found no widely applicable federal\nfraud statute that contains a relevant monetary loss\nthreshold. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §§1341 (mail fraud), 1343\n(wire fraud), 1344 (bank fraud), 371 (conspiracy to defraud\nthe United States), 666 (theft in federally funded pro\ngrams), 1028 (fraud in connection with identification\ndocuments), 1029 (fraud in connection with access de\nvices), 1030 (fraud in connection with computers), 1347\n(health care fraud), and 1348 (securities fraud). Petitioner\nhas found only three federal fraud statutes that do so, and\nthose three contain thresholds not of $10,000, but of\n$100,000 or $1 million, §§668 (theft by fraud of an artwork\nworth $100,000 or more), 1031(a) (contract fraud against\nthe United States where the contract is worth at least $1\nmillion), and 1039(d) (providing enhanced penalties for\nfraud in obtaining telephone records, where the scheme\ninvolves more than $100,000). Why would Congress in\ntend subparagraph (M)(i) to apply to only these three\nfederal statutes, and then choose a monetary threshold\nthat, on its face, would apply to other, nonexistent stat\nutes as well?\n  We recognize, as petitioner argues, that Congress might\nhave intended subparagraph (M)(i) to apply almost exclu\nsively to those who violate certain state fraud and deceit\nstatutes. So we have examined state law. See Appendix\nC, infra. We have found, however, that in 1996, when\nCongress added the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph\n(M)(i), see Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act §321(a)(7), 110 Stat. 3009–628, 29\nStates had no major fraud or deceit statute with any\nrelevant monetary threshold. In 13 of the remaining 21\nStates, fraud and deceit statutes contain relevant mone\ntary thresholds but with amounts significantly higher\nthan $10,000, leaving only 8 States with statutes in re\nspect to which subparagraph (M)(i)’s $10,000 threshold, as\ncategorically interpreted, would have full effect. We do\n10                  NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot believe Congress would have intended (M)(i) to apply\nin so limited and so haphazard a manner. Cf. United\nStates v. Hayes, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 10–\n11) (reaching similar conclusion for similar reason in\nrespect to a statute referring to crimes involving “domestic\nviolence”).\n   Petitioner next points to 8 U. S. C. §1326, which crimi\nnalizes illegal entry after removal and imposes a higher\nmaximum sentence when an alien’s removal was “subse\nquent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated\nfelony.” §1326(b)(2). Petitioner says that a circumstance\nspecific approach to subparagraph (M)(i) could create\npotential constitutional problems in a subsequent criminal\nprosecution under that statute, because loss amount\nwould not have been found beyond a reasonable doubt in\nthe prior criminal proceeding. The Government, however,\nstated in its brief and at oral argument that the later jury,\nduring the illegal reentry trial, would have to find loss\namount beyond a reasonable doubt, Brief for Respondent\n49–50; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39–40, eliminating any constitu\ntional concern. Cf. Hayes, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n   We conclude that Congress did not intend subparagraph\n(M)(i)’s monetary threshold to be applied categorically, i.e.,\nto only those fraud and deceit crimes generically defined to\ninclude that threshold. Rather, the monetary threshold\napplies to the specific circumstances surrounding an of\nfender’s commission of a fraud and deceit crime on a spe\ncific occasion.\n                             III\n   Petitioner, as an alternative argument, says that we\nshould nonetheless borrow from Taylor what that case\ncalled a “modified categorical approach.” He says that, for\nreasons of fairness, we should insist that a jury verdict, or\na judge-approved equivalent, embody a determination that\nthe loss involved in a prior fraud or deceit conviction\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\namounted to at least $10,000. To determine whether that\nis so, petitioner says, the subsequent immigration court\napplying subparagraph (M)(i) should examine only charg\ning documents, jury instructions, and any special jury\nfinding (if one has been requested). If there was a trial\nbut no jury, the subsequent court should examine the\nequivalent judge-made findings. If there was a guilty plea\n(and no trial), the subsequent court should examine the\nwritten plea documents or the plea colloquy. To authorize\nany broader examination of the prior proceedings, peti\ntioner says, would impose an unreasonable administrative\nburden on immigration judges and would unfairly permit\nhim to be deported on the basis of circumstances that were\nnot before judicially determined to have been present and\nwhich he may not have had an opportunity, prior to con\nviction, to dispute.\n   We agree with petitioner that the statute foresees the\nuse of fundamentally fair procedures, including proce\ndures that give an alien a fair opportunity to dispute a\nGovernment claim that a prior conviction involved a fraud\nwith the relevant loss to victims. But we do not agree that\nfairness requires the evidentiary limitations he proposes.\n   For one thing, we have found nothing in prior law that\nso limits the immigration court. Taylor, James, and\nShepard, the cases that developed the evidentiary list to\nwhich petitioner points, developed that list for a very\ndifferent purpose, namely that of determining which\nstatutory phrase (contained within a statutory provision\nthat covers several different generic crimes) covered a\nprior conviction. See supra, at 5; Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602;\nShepard, 544 U. S., at 26. For another, petitioner’s pro\nposal itself can prove impractical insofar as it requires\nobtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that (given\nour Part II determination) is not an element of the offense.\n   Further, a deportation proceeding is a civil proceeding\nin which the Government does not have to prove its claim\n12                  NIJHAWAN v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“beyond a reasonable doubt.” At the same time the evi\ndence that the Government offers must meet a “clear and\nconvincing” standard. 8 U. S. C. §1229a(c)(3)(A). And, as\nthe Government points out, the “loss” must “be tied to the\nspecific counts covered by the conviction.” Brief for Re\nspondent 44; see, e.g., Alaka v. Attorney General of United\nStates, 456 F. 3d 88, 107 (CA3 2006) (loss amount must be\ntethered to offense of conviction; amount cannot be based\non acquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct);\nKnutsen v. Gonzales, 429 F. 3d 733, 739–740 (CA7 2005)\n(same). And the Government adds that the “sole purpose”\nof the “aggravated felony” inquiry “is to ascertain the\nnature of a prior conviction; it is not an invitation to reliti\ngate the conviction itself.” Brief for Respondent 44 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). Finally, the Board of Im\nmigration Appeals, too, has recognized that immigration\njudges must assess findings made at sentencing “with an\neye to what losses are covered and to the burden of proof\nemployed.” In re Babaisakov, 24 I. & N. Dec. 306, 319\n(2007).\n   These considerations, taken together, mean that peti\ntioner and those in similar circumstances have at least\none and possibly two opportunities to contest the amount\nof loss, the first at the earlier sentencing and the second at\nthe deportation hearing itself. They also mean that, since\nthe Government must show the amount of loss by clear\nand convincing evidence, uncertainties caused by the\npassage of time are likely to count in the alien’s favor.\n   We can find nothing unfair about the immigration\njudge’s having here relied upon earlier sentencing-related\nmaterial. The defendant’s own stipulation, produced for\nsentencing purposes, shows that the conviction involved\nlosses considerably greater than $10,000. The court’s\nrestitution order shows the same. In the absence of any\nconflicting evidence (and petitioner mentions none), this\nevidence is clear and convincing.\n                Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                 13\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner’s prior\nfederal conviction consequently falls within the scope of\nsubparagraph (M)(i).
