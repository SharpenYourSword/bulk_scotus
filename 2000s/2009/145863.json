S. ____ (2009)            1\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n                         _________________\n\n           Nos. 08A1096, 08\u20131513 (08A1099), 08A1100\n                         _________________\n\n\n  INDIANA STATE POLICE PENSION TRUST ET AL.\n08A1096              v.\n             CHRYSLER LLC ET AL.\n\n          CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY ET AL.\n08\u20131513 (08A1099)      v.\n               CHRYSLER LLC ET AL.\n\n                  PATRICIA PASCALE\n08A1100                   v.\n                 CHRYSLER LLC ET AL.\n                ON APPLICATIONS FOR STAY\n                        [June 9, 2009]\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The applications for stay presented to JUSTICE\nGINSBURG and by her referred to the Court are denied.\nThe temporary stay entered by JUSTICE GINSBURG on\nJune 8, 2009, is vacated.\n   A denial of a stay is not a decision on the merits of the\nunderlying legal issues. In determining whether to grant\na stay, we consider instead whether the applicant has\ndemonstrated \u201c(1) a reasonable probability that four Jus\ntices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to\ngrant certiorari or to note probable jurisdiction; (2) a fair\nprospect that a majority of the Court will conclude that\nthe decision below was erroneous; and (3) a likelihood that\nirreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay.\u201d\nConkright v. Fommert, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 1\u20132) (GINSBURG, J., in chambers) (internal quotation\n2         INDIANA STATE POLICE PENSION TRUST v.\n\n                     CHRYSLER LLC                             \n\n                        Per Curiam\n\n\nmarks and alterations omitted). In addition, \u201cin a close\ncase it may be appropriate to balance the equities,\u201d to\nassess the relative harms to the parties, \u201cas well as the\ninterests of the public at large.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   \u201cA stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable\ninjury might otherwise result.\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It is instead an exercise of judicial discretion,\nand the \u201cparty requesting a stay bears the burden of show\ning that the circumstances justify an exercise of that\ndiscretion.\u201d Ibid. The applicants have not carried that\nburden.\n   \u201c[T]he propriety of [a stay] is dependent upon the cir\ncumstances of the particular case,\u201d and the \u201ctraditional\nstay factors contemplate individualized judgments in each\ncase.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Our as\nsessment of the stay factors here is based on the record\nand proceedings in this case alone.\n",
