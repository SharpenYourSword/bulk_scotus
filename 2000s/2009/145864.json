UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 07\u20131309. Argued January 14, 2009\u2014Decided June 8, 2009\nThe evidence at petitioner Boyle\u2019s trial for violating the Racketeer In\n  fluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision forbidding\n  \u201cany person . . . associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the ac\n  tivities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\n  participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s\n  affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71962(c), was sufficient to prove, among other things, that Boyle and\n  others committed a series of bank thefts in several States; that the\n  participants included a core group, along with others recruited from\n  time to time; and that the core group was loosely and informally or\n  ganized, lacking a leader, hierarchy, or any long-term master plan.\n  Relying largely on United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 583, the\n  District Court instructed the jury that to establish a RICO associa\n  tion-in-fact \u201centerprise,\u201d the Government must prove (1) an ongoing\n  organization with a framework, formal or informal, for carrying out\n  its objectives, and (2) that association members functioned as a con\n  tinuing unit to achieve a common purpose. The court also told the\n  jury that an association-in-fact\u2019s existence is often more readily\n  proved by what it does than by abstract analysis of its structure, and\n  denied Boyle\u2019s request for an instruction requiring the Government\n  to prove that the enterprise had \u201can ascertainable structural hierar\n  chy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d Boyle was convicted,\n  and the Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. An association-in-fact enterprise under RICO must have a\n \u201cstructure,\u201d but the pertinent jury instruction need not be framed in\n the precise language Boyle proposes, i.e., as having \u201can ascertainable\n structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity\n2                      BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    in which it engages.\u201d Pp. 4\u201312.\n         (a) In light of RICO\u2019s broad statement that an enterprise \u201cin\n    cludes any . . . group of individuals associated in fact although not a\n    legal entity,\u201d \u00a71961(4), and the requirement that RICO be \u201cliberally\n    construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,\u201d note following \u00a71961,\n    Turkette explained that \u201centerprise\u201d reaches \u201ca group of persons asso\n    ciated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of con\n    duct,\u201d 452 U. S., at 583, and \u201cis proved by evidence of an ongoing or\n    ganization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various\n    associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 4\u20135.\n         (b) The question presented by this case is whether an associa\n    tion-in-fact enterprise must have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond\n    that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it en\n    gages.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. This question can be broken into three parts.\n    First, the enterprise must have a \u201cstructure\u201d that, under RICO\u2019s\n    terms, has at least three features: a purpose, relationships among the\n    associates, and longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue\n    the enterprise\u2019s purpose. See Turkette, 452 U. S., at 583. The in\n    structions need not actually use the term \u201cstructure,\u201d however, so\n    long as the relevant point\u2019s substance is adequately expressed. Sec\n    ond, because a jury must find the existence of elements of a crime be\n    yond a reasonable doubt, requiring a jury to find the existence of a\n    structure that is ascertainable would be redundant and potentially\n    misleading. Third, the phrase \u201cbeyond that inherent in the pattern of\n    racketeering activity\u201d is correctly interpreted to mean that the enter\n    prise\u2019s existence is a separate element that must be proved, not that\n    such existence may never be inferred from the evidence showing that\n    the associates engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. See ibid.\n    Pp. 6\u20138.\n         (c) Boyle\u2019s argument that an enterprise must have structural fea\n    tures additional to those that can be fairly inferred from RICO\u2019s lan\n    guage\u2014e.g., a hierarchical structure or chain of command; fixed roles\n    for associates; and an enterprise name, regular meetings, dues, es\n    tablished rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction\n    or initiation ceremonies\u2014has no basis in the statute\u2019s text. As\n    Turkette said, an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing\n    unit that functions with a common purpose. The breadth of RICO\u2019s\n    \u201centerprise\u201d concept is highlighted by comparing the statute with\n    other federal laws having much more stringent requirements for tar\n    geting organized criminal groups: E.g., \u00a71955(b) defines an \u201cillegal\n    gambling business\u201d as one that \u201cinvolves five or more persons who\n    conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such\n    business.\u201d Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (d) Rejection of Boyle\u2019s argument does not lead to a merger of the\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  \u00a71962(c) crime and other federal offenses. For example, proof that a\n  defendant violated \u00a71955 does not necessarily establish that he con\n  spired to participate in a gambling enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pat\n  tern of racketeering activity. Rather, that would require the prosecu\n  tion to prove either that the defendant committed a pattern of \u00a71955\n  violations or a pattern of state-law gambling crimes. See \u00a71961(1).\n  Pp. 10\u201311.\n        (e) Because RICO\u2019s language is clear, the Court need not reach\n  Boyle\u2019s statutory purpose, legislative history, or rule-of-lenity argu\n  ments. Pp. 11\u201312.\n     2. The instructions below were correct and adequate. By explicitly\n  telling jurors they could not convict on the RICO charges unless they\n  found that the Government had proved the existence of an enterprise,\n  the instructions made clear that this was a separate element from\n  the pattern of racketeering activity. The jurors also were adequately\n  told that the enterprise needed the structural attributes that may be\n  inferred from the statutory language. Finally, the instruction that an\n  enterprise\u2019s existence \u201cis oftentimes more readily proven by what it\n  does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure\u201d properly con\n  veyed Turkette\u2019s point that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity\n  may be sufficient in a particular case to permit an inference of the\n  enterprise\u2019s existence.

S. C. \u00a71961 et\nseq., must have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond that\ninherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it\nengages.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. We hold that such an enterprise\nmust have a \u201cstructure\u201d but that an instruction framed in\nthis precise language is not necessary. The District Court\nproperly instructed the jury in this case. We therefore\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The evidence at petitioner\u2019s trial was sufficient to prove\nthe following: Petitioner and others participated in a\nseries of bank thefts in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and\nWisconsin during the 1990\u2019s. The participants in these\ncrimes included a core group, along with others who were\nrecruited from time to time. Although the participants\nsometimes attempted bank-vault burglaries and bank\nrobberies, the group usually targeted cash-laden night\n2                BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeposit boxes, which are often found in banks in retail\nareas.\n   Each theft was typically carried out by a group of par\nticipants who met beforehand to plan the crime, gather\ntools (such as crowbars, fishing gaffs, and walkie-talkies),\nand assign the roles that each participant would play\n(such as lookout and driver). The participants generally\nsplit the proceeds from the thefts. The group was loosely\nand informally organized. It does not appear to have had\na leader or hierarchy; nor does it appear that the partici\npants ever formulated any long-term master plan or\nagreement.\n   From 1991 to 1994, the core group was responsible for\nmore than 30 night-deposit-box thefts. By 1994, petitioner\nhad joined the group, and over the next five years, he\nparticipated in numerous attempted night-deposit-box\nthefts and at least two attempted bank-vault burglaries.\n   In 2003, petitioner was indicted for participation in the\nconduct of the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of\nracketeering activity, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962(c);\nconspiracy to commit that offense, in violation of \u00a71962(d);\nconspiracy to commit bank burglary, in violation of \u00a7371;\nand nine counts of bank burglary and attempted bank\nburglary, in violation of \u00a72113(a).\n                             B\n   In instructing the jury on the meaning of a RICO \u201cen\nterprise,\u201d the District Court relied largely on language in\nUnited States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576 (1981). The court\ntold the jurors that, in order to establish the existence of\nsuch an enterprise, the Government had to prove that:\n\u201c(1) There [was] an ongoing organization with some sort of\nframework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objec\ntives; and (2) the various members and associates of the\nassociation function[ed] as a continuing unit to achieve a\ncommon purpose.\u201d App. 112. Over petitioner\u2019s objection,\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe court also told the jury that it could \u201cfind an enterprise\nwhere an association of individuals, without structural\nhierarchy, form[ed] solely for the purpose of carrying out a\npattern of racketeering acts\u201d and that \u201c[c]ommon sense\nsuggests that the existence of an association-in-fact is\noftentimes more readily proven by what it does, rather\nthan by abstract analysis of its structure.\u201d Id., at 111\u2013\n112.1\n  Petitioner requested an instruction that the Govern\nment was required to prove that the enterprise \u201chad an\nongoing organization, a core membership that functioned\nas a continuing unit, and an ascertainable structural\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The  relevant portion of the instructions was as follows:\n   \u201cThe term \u2018enterprise\u2019 as used in these instructions may also include\na group of people associated in fact, even though this association is not\nrecognized as a legal entity. Indeed, an enterprise need not have a\nname. Thus, an enterprise need not be a form[al] business entity such\nas a corporation, but may be merely an informal association of indi\nviduals. A group or association of people can be an \u2018enterprise\u2019 if,\namong other requirements, these individuals \u2018associate\u2019 together for a\npurpose of engaging in a course of conduct. Common sense sug\ngests that the existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more\nreadily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its\nstructure.\n   \u201cMoreover, you may find an enterprise where an association of indi\nviduals, without structural hierarchy, forms solely for the purpose of\ncarrying out a pattern of racketeering acts. Such an association of\npersons may be established by evidence showing an ongoing organiza\ntion, formal or informal, and . . . by evidence that the people making up\nthe association functioned as a continuing unit. Therefore, in order to\nestablish the existence of such an enterprise, the government must\nprove that: (1) There is an ongoing organization with some sort of\nframework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives; and (2)\nthe various members and associates of the association function as a\ncontinuing unit to achieve a common purpose.\n   \u201cRegarding \u2018organization,\u2019 it is not necessary that the enterprise have\nany particular or formal structure, but it must have sufficient organiza\ntion that its members functioned and operated in a coordinated manner\nin order to carry out the alleged common purpose or purposes of the\nenterprise.\u201d App. 111\u2013113 (emphasis added).\n4                     BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhierarchy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d Id., at\n95. The District Court refused to give that instruction.\n  Petitioner was convicted on 11 of the 12 counts against\nhim, including the RICO counts, and was sentenced to 151\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment. In a summary order, the Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed his conviction but\nvacated the sentence on a ground not relevant to the\nissues before us. 283 Fed. Appx. 825 (2007). The Court of\nAppeals did not specifically address the RICO jury in\nstructions, stating only that the arguments not discussed\nin the order were \u201cwithout merit.\u201d Id., at 826. Petitioner\nwas then resentenced, and we granted certiorari, 554 U. S.\n___ (2008), to resolve conflicts among the Courts of Ap\npeals concerning the meaning of a RICO enterprise.\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n   RICO makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities\nof which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct\nor participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity or collection of unlawful debt.\u201d         18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71962(c) (emphasis added).\n   The statute does not specifically define the outer\nboundaries of the \u201centerprise\u201d concept but states that the\nterm \u201cincludes any individual, partnership, corporation,\nassociation, or other legal entity, and any union or group\nof individuals associated in fact although not a legal en\ntity.\u201d \u00a71961(4).2 This enumeration of included enterprises\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This provision does not purport to set out an exhaustive definition of\n\nthe term \u201centerprise.\u201d Compare \u00a7\u00a71961(1)\u2013(2) (defining what the terms\n\u201cracketeering activity\u201d and \u201cState\u201d mean) with \u00a7\u00a71961(3)\u2013(4) (defining\nwhat the terms \u201cperson\u201d and \u201centerprise\u201d include). Accordingly, this\nprovision does not foreclose the possibility that the term might include,\nin addition to the specifically enumerated entities, others that fall\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

(emphasis added). The\nterm \u201cany\u201d ensures that the definition has a wide reach,\nsee, e.g., Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 4\u20135), and the very concept of an\nassociation in fact is expansive. In addition, the RICO\nstatute provides that its terms are to be \u201cliberally con\nstrued to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u201d \u00a7904(a), 84\nStat. 947, note following 18 U. S. C. \u00a71961; see also, e.g.,\nNational Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510\nU. S. 249, 257 (1994) (\u201cRICO broadly defines \u2018enterprise\u2019 \u201d);\nSedima, S. P. R. L. v.

We see no basis to impose such an extratex\ntual requirement.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwithin the ordinary meaning of the term \u201centerprise.\u201d See H. J.

In the sense\nrelevant here, the term \u201cstructure\u201d means \u201c[t]he way in\nwhich parts are arranged or put together to form a whole\u201d\nand \u201c[t]he interrelation or arrangement of parts in a com\nplex entity.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 1718 (4th ed.\n2000); see also Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 1410 (1967) (defining structure to mean, among\nother things, \u201cthe pattern of relationships, as of status or\nfriendship, existing among the members of a group or\nsociety\u201d).\n   From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an associa\ntion-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural\nfeatures: a purpose, relationships among those associated\nwith the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\none may not \u201cconduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the\nconduct of [an] enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d Whatever business-like characteristics the dissent has in\nmind, we do not see them in \u00a71962(c). Furthermore, Reves v. Ernst &\nYoung, 507 U. S. 170 (1993), is inapposite because that case turned on\nour interpretation of the participation requirement of \u00a71962, not the\ndefinition of \u201centerprise.\u201d See id., at 184\u2013185. In any case, it would be\nan interpretive stretch to deduce from the requirement that an enter\nprise must be \u201cdirected\u201d to impose the much broader, amorphous\nrequirement that it be \u201cbusiness-like.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthese associates to pursue the enterprise\u2019s purpose. As we\nsuccinctly put it in Turkette, an association-in-fact enter\nprise is \u201ca group of persons associated together for a com\nmon purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.\u201d 452\nU. S., at 583.\n   That an \u201centerprise\u201d must have a purpose is apparent\nfrom meaning of the term in ordinary usage, i.e., a \u201cven\nture,\u201d \u201cundertaking,\u201d or \u201cproject.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 757 (1976). The concept of \u201casso\nciat[ion]\u201d requires both interpersonal relationships and a\ncommon interest. See id., at 132 (defining \u201cassociation\u201d as\n\u201can organization of persons having a common interest\u201d);\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 156 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (defining\n\u201cassociation\u201d as a \u201ccollection of persons who have joined\ntogether for a certain object\u201d). Section 1962(c) reinforces\nthis conclusion and also shows that an \u201centerprise\u201d must\nhave some longevity, since the offense proscribed by that\nprovision demands proof that the enterprise had \u201caffairs\u201d\nof sufficient duration to permit an associate to \u201cpartici\npate\u201d in those affairs through \u201ca pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d\n   Although an association-in-fact enterprise must have\nthese structural features, it does not follow that a district\ncourt must use the term \u201cstructure\u201d in its jury instruc\ntions. A trial judge has considerable discretion in choosing\nthe language of an instruction so long as the substance of\nthe relevant point is adequately expressed.\n   \u201cAscertainable.\u201d Whenever a jury is told that it must\nfind the existence of an element beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, that element must be \u201cascertainable\u201d or else the\njury could not find that it was proved. Therefore, telling\nthe members of the jury that they had to ascertain the\nexistence of an \u201cascertainable structure\u201d would have been\nredundant and potentially misleading.\n   \u201cBeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d This phrase may be interpreted in least two\n8                    BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent ways, and its correctness depends on the particu\nlar sense in which the phrase is used. If the phrase is\ninterpreted to mean that the existence of an enterprise is\na separate element that must be proved, it is of course\ncorrect. As we explained in Turkette, the existence of an\nenterprise is an element distinct from the pattern of rack\neteering activity and \u201cproof of one does not necessarily\nestablish the other.\u201d4 452 U. S., at 583.\n   On the other hand, if the phrase is used to mean that\nthe existence of an enterprise may never be inferred from\nthe evidence showing that persons associated with the\nenterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, it\nis incorrect. We recognized in Turkette that the evidence\nused to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the\nevidence establishing an enterprise \u201cmay in particular\ncases coalesce.\u201d Ibid.\n                              C\n   The crux of petitioner\u2019s argument is that a RICO enter\nprise must have structural features in addition to those\nthat we think can be fairly inferred from the language of\nthe statute. Although petitioner concedes that an associa\ntion-in-fact enterprise may be an \u201c \u2018informal\u2019 \u201d group and\nthat \u201cnot \u2018much\u2019 \u201d structure is needed, Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 24, he contends that such an enterprise must\nhave at least some additional structural attributes, such\nas a structural \u201chierarchy,\u201d \u201crole differentiation,\u201d a\n\u201cunique modus operandi,\u201d a \u201cchain of command,\u201d \u201cprofes\nsionalism and sophistication of organization,\u201d \u201cdiversity\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 It is easy to envision situations in which proof that individuals en\n\ngaged in a pattern of racketeering activity would not establish the\nexistence of an enterprise. For example, suppose that several individu\nals, independently and without coordination, engaged in a pattern of\ncrimes listed as RICO predicates\u2014for example, bribery or extortion.\nProof of these patterns would not be enough to show that the individu\nals were members of an enterprise.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Such a group need not have a hierarchical struc\nture or a \u201cchain of command\u201d; decisions may be made on\nan ad hoc basis and by any number of methods\u2014by major\nity vote, consensus, a show of strength, etc. Members of\nthe group need not have fixed roles; different members\nmay perform different roles at different times. The group\nneed not have a name, regular meetings, dues, established\nrules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induc\ntion or initiation ceremonies. While the group must func\ntion as a continuing unit and remain in existence long\nenough to pursue a course of conduct, nothing in RICO\nexempts an enterprise whose associates engage in spurts\nof activity punctuated by periods of quiescence. Nor is the\nstatute limited to groups whose crimes are sophisticated,\ndiverse, complex, or unique; for example, a group that does\nnothing but engage in extortion through old-fashioned,\nunsophisticated, and brutal means may fall squarely\nwithin the statute\u2019s reach.\n   The breadth of the \u201centerprise\u201d concept in RICO is\nhighlighted by comparing the statute with other federal\nstatutes that target organized criminal groups. For exam\nple, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71955(b), which was enacted together with\nRICO as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970,\n84 Stat. 922, defines an \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d as one\nthat \u201cinvolves five or more persons who conduct, finance,\n10               BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such busi\nness.\u201d A \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise,\u201d as defined in 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7848(c), must involve more than five persons who\nact in concert and must have an \u201corganizer,\u201d supervisor, or\nother manager. Congress included no such requirements\nin RICO.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   Contrary to petitioner\u2019s claims, rejection of his argu\nment regarding these structural characteristics does not\nlead to a merger of the crime proscribed by 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71962(c) (participating in the affairs of an enterprise\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity) and any of the\nfollowing offenses: operating a gambling business, \u00a71955;\nconspiring to commit one or more crimes that are listed as\nRICO predicate offenses, \u00a7371; or conspiring to violate the\nRICO statute, \u00a71962(d).\n   Proof that a defendant violated \u00a71955 does not necessar\nily establish that the defendant conspired to participate in\nthe affairs of a gambling enterprise through a pattern of\nracketeering activity. In order to prove the latter offense,\nthe prosecution must prove either that the defendant\ncommitted a pattern of \u00a71955 violations or a pattern of\nstate-law gambling crimes. See \u00a71961(1). No such proof is\nneeded to establish a simple violation of \u00a71955.\n   Likewise, proof that a defendant conspired to commit a\nRICO predicate offense\u2014for example, arson\u2014does not\nnecessarily establish that the defendant participated in\nthe affairs of an arson enterprise through a pattern of\narson crimes. Under \u00a7371, a conspiracy is an inchoate\ncrime that may be completed in the brief period needed for\nthe formation of the agreement and the commission of a\nsingle overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Feola, 420 U. S. 671, 694 (1975). Section\n1962(c) demands much more: the creation of an \u201center\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

In\nprior cases, we have rejected similar arguments in favor of\nthe clear but expansive text of the statute. See National\nOrganization for Women, 510 U.

These in\nstructions explicitly told the jurors that they could not\nconvict on the RICO charges unless they found that the\nGovernment had proved the existence of an enterprise.\nSee App. 111. The instructions made clear that this was a\nseparate element from the pattern of racketeering activity.\nIbid.\n  The instructions also adequately told the jury that the\nenterprise needed to have the structural attributes that\nmay be inferred from the statutory language. As noted,\nthe trial judge told the jury that the Government was\nrequired to prove that there was \u201can ongoing organization\nwith some sort of framework, formal or informal, for carry\ning out its objectives\u201d and that \u201cthe various members and\nassociates of the association function[ed] as a continuing\nunit to achieve a common purpose.\u201d Id., at 112.\n  Finally, the trial judge did not err in instructing the jury\nthat \u201cthe existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes\nmore readily proven by what it does, rather than by ab\nstract analysis of its structure.\u201d Id., at 111\u2013112. This\ninstruction properly conveyed the point we made in\nTurkette that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity\nmay be sufficient in a particular case to permit a jury to\ninfer the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise.\n  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. \u00a71961 et seq., to refer\nonly to business-like entities that have an existence apart\nfrom the predicate acts committed by their employees or\nassociates. The trial judge in this case committed two\nsignificant errors relating to the meaning of that term.\nFirst, he instructed the jury that \u201can association of indi\nviduals, without structural hierarchy, form[ed] solely for\nthe purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts\u201d\ncan constitute an enterprise. App. 112. And he allowed\nthe jury to find that element satisfied by evidence showing\na group of criminals with no existence beyond its intermit\ntent commission of racketeering acts and related offenses.\nBecause the Court\u2019s decision affirming petitioner\u2019s convic\ntion is inconsistent with the statutory meaning of the term\nenterprise and serves to expand RICO liability far beyond\nthe bounds Congress intended, I respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  RICO makes it \u201cunlawful for any person employed by or\nassociated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities\nof which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct\n2                    BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nor participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d \u00a71962(c). The statute defines \u201centerprise\u201d to\ninclude \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation, associa\ntion, or other legal entity, and any union or group of indi\nviduals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d\n\u00a71961(4).\n   It is clear from the statute and our earlier decisions\nconstruing the term that Congress used \u201centerprise\u201d in\nthese provisions in the sense of \u201ca business organization,\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 757 (1976),\nrather than \u201ca \u2018venture,\u2019 \u2018undertaking,\u2019 or \u2018project,\u2019 \u201d ante,\nat 6 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Diction\nary, at 757). First, the terms \u201cindividual, partnership,\ncorporation, association, or other legal entity\u201d describe\nentities with formal legal structures most commonly es\ntablished for business purposes. \u00a71961(4). In context, the\nsubsequent reference to any \u201cunion or group of individuals\nassociated in fact although not a legal entity\u201d reflects an\nintended commonality between the legal and nonlegal\nentities included in the provision. Ibid.

See National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510\nU. S. 249, 252 (1994) (NOW); United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576,\n580\u2013581 (1981). But those holdings are consistent with the conclusion\nthat an enterprise is a business-like entity. Indeed, the examples of\nqualifying associations cited in Turkette\u2014including loan-sharking,\nproperty-fencing, drug-trafficking, and counterfeiting operations\u2014\nsatisfy that criterion, as each describes an organization with continuing\noperations directed toward providing goods or services to its customers.\nSee id., at 589\u2013590 (citing 84 Stat. 923; 116 Cong.

Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170 (1993). Section\n1962(c) creates liability for \u201cconduct[ing] or participat[ing]\n. . . in the conduct of [an] enterprise\u2019s affairs through a\npattern of racketeering activity.\u201d In Reves, we examined\nthat provision\u2019s meaning and held that, \u201c[i]n order to\n\u2018participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs,\u2019 one must have some part in directing\nthose affairs.\u201d Id., at 179 (quoting \u00a71962(c)). It is not\nenough for a defendant to \u201ccarry on\u201d or \u201cparticipate in\u201d an\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity; instead, evidence that he operated, managed, or\ndirected those affairs is required. See id., at 177\u2013179.\nThis requirement confirms that the enterprise element\ndemands evidence of a certain quantum of business-like\norganization\u2014i.e., a system of processes, dealings, or other\naffairs that can be \u201cdirected.\u201d\n    Our cases also make clear that an enterprise \u201cis an\nentity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in\nwhich it engages.\u201d United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S.\n576, 583 (1981). As with the requirement that an enter\nprise have business-like characteristics, that an enterprise\nmust have a separate existence is confirmed by \u00a71962(c)\nand Reves. If an entity\u2019s existence consisted solely of its\nmembers\u2019 performance of a pattern of racketeering acts,\nthe \u201centerprise\u2019s affairs\u201d would be synonymous with the\n\u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d Section 1962(c) would\nthen prohibit an individual from conducting or participat\ning in \u201cthe conduct of [a pattern of racketeering activity]\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity\u201d\u2014a reading\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSimilarly, the enterprise at issue in NOW was a nationwide network of\nantiabortion groups that had a leadership counsel and regular confer\nences and whose members undertook an extensive pattern of extortion,\narson, and other racketeering activity for the purpose of \u201cshut[ting]\ndown abortion clinics.\u201d 510 U. S., at 253.\n4                    BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthat is unbearably redundant, particularly in a case like\nthis one in which a single pattern of activity is alleged.\nThe only way to avoid that result is to require that an\n\u201centerprise\u2019s affairs\u201d be something other than the pattern\nof racketeering activity undertaken by its members.2\n   Recognizing an enterprise\u2019s business-like nature and its\ndistinctness from the pattern of predicate acts, however,\ndoes not answer the question of what proof each element\nrequires. In cases involving a legal entity, the matter of\nproving the enterprise element is straightforward, as the\nentity\u2019s legal existence will always be something apart\nfrom the pattern of activity performed by the defendant or\nhis associates. Cf. Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v.\nKing, 533 U. S. 158, 163 (2001). But in the case of an\nassociation-in-fact enterprise, the Government must ad\nduce other evidence of the entity\u2019s \u201cseparate\u201d existence\nand \u201congoing organization.\u201d Turkette, 452 U. S., at 583.\nThere may be cases in which a jury can infer that exis\ntence and continuity from the evidence used to establish\nthe pattern of racketeering activity. Ibid. But that will be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        other subsections of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962 further demonstrate the\nbusiness-like nature of the enterprise element and its necessary dis\ntinctness from the pattern of racketeering activity. Subsection (a)\nprohibits anyone who receives income derived from a pattern of racket\neering activity from \u201cus[ing] or invest[ing], directly or indirectly, any\npart of such income . . . in acquisition of any interest in, or the estab\nlishment or operation of, any enterprise.\u201d And subsection (b) prohibits\nanyone from \u201cacquir[ing] or maintain[ing]\u201d any interest in or control of\nan enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. We noted in\nNOW that the term enterprise \u201cplays a different role in the structure\u201d\nof those subsections than it does in subsection (c) because the enter\nprise in those subsections is the victim. 510 U. S., at 258\u2013259. We did\nnot, however, suggest that the term has a substantially different\nmeaning in each subsection. To the contrary, our observation that the\nenterprise in subsection (c) is \u201cthe vehicle through which the unlawful\npattern of racketeering activity is committed,\u201d id., at 259, indicates\nthat, as in subsections (a) and (b), the enterprise must have an exis\ntence apart from the pattern of racketeering activity.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntrue only when the pattern of activity is so complex that it\ncould not be performed in the absence of structures or\nprocesses for planning or concealing the illegal conduct\nbeyond those inherent in performing the predicate acts.\nMore often, proof of an enterprise\u2019s separate existence will\nrequire different evidence from that used to establish the\npattern of predicate acts.\n   Precisely what proof is required in each case is a more\ndifficult question, largely due to the abundant variety of\nRICO predicates and enterprises. Because covered enter\nprises are necessarily business-like in nature, however,\nproof of an association-in-fact enterprise\u2019s separate exis\ntence will generally require evidence of rules, routines, or\nprocesses through which the entity maintains its continu\ning operations and seeks to conceal its illegal acts. As\npetitioner suggests, this requirement will usually be satis\nfied by evidence that the association has an \u201cascertainable\nstructure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeer\ning activity in which it engages.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Exam\nples of such structure include an organizational hierarchy,\na \u201cframework for making decisions,\u201d an \u201cinternal disci\npline mechanism,\u201d \u201cregular meetings,\u201d or a practice of\n\u201creinvest[ing] proceeds to promote and expand the enter\nprise.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 31\u201334. In other cases,\nthe enterprise\u2019s existence might be established through\nevidence that it provides goods or services to third parties,\nas such an undertaking will require organizational ele\nments more comprehensive than those necessary to per\nform a pattern of predicate acts. Thus, the evidence\nneeded to establish an enterprise will vary from case to\ncase, but in every case the Government must carry its\nburden of proving that an alleged enterprise has an exis\ntence separate from the pattern of racketeering activity\nundertaken by its constituents.\n6                 BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                             II\n   In some respects, my reading of the statute is not very\ndifferent from that adopted by the Court. We agree that\n\u201can association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three\nstructural features: a purpose, relationships among those\nassociated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to\npermit these associates to pursue the enterprise\u2019s pur\npose.\u201d Ante, at 6. But the Court stops short of giving\ncontent to that requirement. It states only that RICO\n\u201cdemands proof that the enterprise had \u2018affairs\u2019 of suffi\ncient duration to permit an associate to \u2018participate\u2019 in\nthose affairs through \u2018a pattern of racketeering activity,\u2019 \u201d\nbefore concluding that \u201c[a] trial judge has considerable\ndiscretion in choosing the language of an instruction\u201d and\nneed not use the term \u201cstructure.\u201d Ante, at 7. While I\nagree the word structure is not talismanic, I would hold\nthat the instructions must convey the requirement that\nthe alleged enterprise have an existence apart from the\nalleged pattern of predicate acts. The Court\u2019s decision, by\ncontrast, will allow juries to infer the existence of an\nenterprise in every case involving a pattern of racketeer\ning activity undertaken by two or more associates.\n   By permitting the Government to prove both elements\nwith the same evidence, the Court renders the enterprise\nrequirement essentially meaningless in association-in-fact\ncases. It also threatens to make that category of \u00a71962(c)\noffenses indistinguishable from conspiracies to commit\npredicate acts, see \u00a7371, as the only remaining difference\nis \u00a71962(c)\u2019s pattern requirement. The Court resists this\ncriticism, arguing that \u00a71962(c) \u201cdemands much more\u201d\nthan the inchoate offense defined in \u00a7371. Ante, at 10. It\nstates that the latter \u201cmay be completed in the brief period\nneeded for the formation of the agreement and the com\nmission of a single overt act in furtherance of the conspir\nacy,\u201d whereas the former requires the creation of \u201ca group\nwith a common purpose and course of conduct\u2014and the\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nactual commission of a pattern of predicate offenses.\u201d\nIbid. Given that it is also unlawful to conspire to violate\n\u00a71962(c), see \u00a71962(d), this comment provides no assur\nance that RICO and \u00a7371 offenses remain distinct. Only if\nproof of the enterprise element\u2014the \u201cgroup with a com\nmon purpose and course of conduct\u201d\u2014requires evidence of\nactivity or organization beyond that inherent in the pat\ntern of predicate acts will RICO offenses retain an identity\ndistinct from \u00a7371 offenses.\n  This case illustrates these concerns. The trial judge\ninstructed the jury that an enterprise need have only the\ndegree of organization necessary \u201cfor carrying out its\nobjectives\u201d and that it could \u201cfind an enterprise where an\nassociation of individuals, without structural hierarchy,\nforms solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of\nracketeering acts.\u201d App. 112.3 These instructions were\nplainly deficient, as they did not require the Government\nto prove that the alleged enterprise had an existence apart\nfrom the pattern of predicate acts. Instead, they permit\nted the Government\u2019s proof of the enterprise\u2019s structure\nand continuing nature\u2014requirements on which all\nagree\u2014to consist only of evidence that petitioner and his\nassociates performed a pattern of racketeering activity.\n  Petitioner\u2019s requested instruction would have required\nthe jury to find that the alleged enterprise \u201chad an ongo\ning organization, a core membership that functioned as a\ncontinuing unit, and an ascertainable structural hierarchy\ndistinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d Id., at 95. That\ninstruction does not precisely track my understanding of\nthe statute; although evidence of \u201cstructural hierarchy\u201d\ncan evidence an enterprise, it is not necessary to establish\nthat element. Nevertheless, the proposed instruction\nwould have better directed the jury to consider whether\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For the full text of the relevant portion of the instructions, see ante,\n\nat 3, n. 1.\n8                BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe alleged enterprise possessed the separate existence\nnecessary to expose petitioner to liability under \u00a71962(c),\nand the trial judge should have considered an instruction\nalong those lines.\n   The trial judge also erred in finding the Government\u2019s\nevidence in this case sufficient to support petitioner\u2019s\nRICO convictions. Petitioner was alleged to have partici\npated and conspired to participate in the conduct of an\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity consisting of one act of bank robbery and three\nacts of interstate transportation of stolen funds. Id., at\n15\u201319. The \u201cprimary goals\u201d of the alleged enterprise\n\u201cincluded generating money for its members and associ\nates through the commission of criminal activity, includ\ning bank robberies, bank burglaries and interstate trans\nportation of stolen money.\u201d Id., at 14. And its modus\noperandi was to congregate periodically when an associate\nhad a lead on a night-deposit box that the group could\nbreak into. Whoever among the associates was available\nwould bring screwdrivers, crowbars, and walkie-talkies to\nthe location. Some acted as lookouts, while others re\ntrieved the money. When the endeavor was successful, the\nparticipants would split the proceeds. Thus, the group\u2019s\npurpose and activities, and petitioner\u2019s participation\ntherein, were limited to sporadic acts of taking money\nfrom bank deposit boxes. There is no evidence in RICO\u2019s\ntext or history that Congress intended it to reach such\nad hoc associations of thieves.\n                             III\n  Because the instructions and evidence in this case did\nnot satisfy the requirement that an alleged enterprise\nhave an existence separate and apart from the pattern of\nactivity in which it engages, I respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued January 14, 2009\u2014Decided June 8, 2009\nThe evidence at petitioner Boyle\u2019s trial for violating the Racketeer In\n  fluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision forbidding\n  \u201cany person . . . associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the ac\n  tivities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\n  participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s\n  affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71962(c), was sufficient to prove, among other things, that Boyle and\n  others committed a series of bank thefts in several States; that the\n  participants included a core group, along with others recruited from\n  time to time; and that the core group was loosely and informally or\n  ganized, lacking a leader, hierarchy, or any long-term master plan.\n  Relying largely on United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 583, the\n  District Court instructed the jury that to establish a RICO associa\n  tion-in-fact \u201centerprise,\u201d the Government must prove (1) an ongoing\n  organization with a framework, formal or informal, for carrying out\n  its objectives, and (2) that association members functioned as a con\n  tinuing unit to achieve a common purpose. The court also told the\n  jury that an association-in-fact\u2019s existence is often more readily\n  proved by what it does than by abstract analysis of its structure, and\n  denied Boyle\u2019s request for an instruction requiring the Government\n  to prove that the enterprise had \u201can ascertainable structural hierar\n  chy distinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d Boyle was convicted,\n  and the Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. An association-in-fact enterprise under RICO must have a\n \u201cstructure,\u201d but the pertinent jury instruction need not be framed in\n the precise language Boyle proposes, i.e., as having \u201can ascertainable\n structure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity\n2                      BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    in which it engages.\u201d Pp. 4\u201312.\n         (a) In light of RICO\u2019s broad statement that an enterprise \u201cin\n    cludes any . . . group of individuals associated in fact although not a\n    legal entity,\u201d \u00a71961(4), and the requirement that RICO be \u201cliberally\n    construed to effectuate its remedial purposes,\u201d note following \u00a71961,\n    Turkette explained that \u201centerprise\u201d reaches \u201ca group of persons asso\n    ciated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of con\n    duct,\u201d 452 U. S., at 583, and \u201cis proved by evidence of an ongoing or\n    ganization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various\n    associates function as a continuing unit.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 4\u20135.\n         (b) The question presented by this case is whether an associa\n    tion-in-fact enterprise must have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond\n    that inherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it en\n    gages.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. This question can be broken into three parts.\n    First, the enterprise must have a \u201cstructure\u201d that, under RICO\u2019s\n    terms, has at least three features: a purpose, relationships among the\n    associates, and longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue\n    the enterprise\u2019s purpose. See Turkette, 452 U. S., at 583. The in\n    structions need not actually use the term \u201cstructure,\u201d however, so\n    long as the relevant point\u2019s substance is adequately expressed. Sec\n    ond, because a jury must find the existence of elements of a crime be\n    yond a reasonable doubt, requiring a jury to find the existence of a\n    structure that is ascertainable would be redundant and potentially\n    misleading. Third, the phrase \u201cbeyond that inherent in the pattern of\n    racketeering activity\u201d is correctly interpreted to mean that the enter\n    prise\u2019s existence is a separate element that must be proved, not that\n    such existence may never be inferred from the evidence showing that\n    the associates engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. See ibid.\n    Pp. 6\u20138.\n         (c) Boyle\u2019s argument that an enterprise must have structural fea\n    tures additional to those that can be fairly inferred from RICO\u2019s lan\n    guage\u2014e.g., a hierarchical structure or chain of command; fixed roles\n    for associates; and an enterprise name, regular meetings, dues, es\n    tablished rules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induction\n    or initiation ceremonies\u2014has no basis in the statute\u2019s text. As\n    Turkette said, an association-in-fact enterprise is simply a continuing\n    unit that functions with a common purpose. The breadth of RICO\u2019s\n    \u201centerprise\u201d concept is highlighted by comparing the statute with\n    other federal laws having much more stringent requirements for tar\n    geting organized criminal groups: E.g., \u00a71955(b) defines an \u201cillegal\n    gambling business\u201d as one that \u201cinvolves five or more persons who\n    conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such\n    business.\u201d Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (d) Rejection of Boyle\u2019s argument does not lead to a merger of the\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

For example, proof that a\n  defendant violated \u00a71955 does not necessarily establish that he con\n  spired to participate in a gambling enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pat\n  tern of racketeering activity. Rather, that would require the prosecu\n  tion to prove either that the defendant committed a pattern of \u00a71955\n  violations or a pattern of state-law gambling crimes. See \u00a71961(1).\n  Pp. 10\u201311.\n        (e) Because RICO\u2019s language is clear, the Court need not reach\n  Boyle\u2019s statutory purpose, legislative history, or rule-of-lenity argu\n  ments. Pp. 11\u201312.\n     2. The instructions below were correct and adequate. By explicitly\n  telling jurors they could not convict on the RICO charges unless they\n  found that the Government had proved the existence of an enterprise,\n  the instructions made clear that this was a separate element from\n  the pattern of racketeering activity. The jurors also were adequately\n  told that the enterprise needed the structural attributes that may be\n  inferred from the statutory language. Finally, the instruction that an\n  enterprise\u2019s existence \u201cis oftentimes more readily proven by what it\n  does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure\u201d properly con\n  veyed Turkette\u2019s point that proof of a pattern of racketeering activity\n  may be sufficient in a particular case to permit an inference of the\n  enterprise\u2019s existence.

S. C. \u00a71961 et\nseq., must have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond that\ninherent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it\nengages.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. We hold that such an enterprise\nmust have a \u201cstructure\u201d but that an instruction framed in\nthis precise language is not necessary. The District Court\nproperly instructed the jury in this case. We therefore\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The evidence at petitioner\u2019s trial was sufficient to prove\nthe following: Petitioner and others participated in a\nseries of bank thefts in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and\nWisconsin during the 1990\u2019s. The participants in these\ncrimes included a core group, along with others who were\nrecruited from time to time. Although the participants\nsometimes attempted bank-vault burglaries and bank\nrobberies, the group usually targeted cash-laden night\n2                BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeposit boxes, which are often found in banks in retail\nareas.\n   Each theft was typically carried out by a group of par\nticipants who met beforehand to plan the crime, gather\ntools (such as crowbars, fishing gaffs, and walkie-talkies),\nand assign the roles that each participant would play\n(such as lookout and driver). The participants generally\nsplit the proceeds from the thefts. The group was loosely\nand informally organized. It does not appear to have had\na leader or hierarchy; nor does it appear that the partici\npants ever formulated any long-term master plan or\nagreement.\n   From 1991 to 1994, the core group was responsible for\nmore than 30 night-deposit-box thefts. By 1994, petitioner\nhad joined the group, and over the next five years, he\nparticipated in numerous attempted night-deposit-box\nthefts and at least two attempted bank-vault burglaries.\n   In 2003, petitioner was indicted for participation in the\nconduct of the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of\nracketeering activity, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962(c);\nconspiracy to commit that offense, in violation of \u00a71962(d);\nconspiracy to commit bank burglary, in violation of \u00a7371;\nand nine counts of bank burglary and attempted bank\nburglary, in violation of \u00a72113(a).\n                             B\n   In instructing the jury on the meaning of a RICO \u201cen\nterprise,\u201d the District Court relied largely on language in\nUnited States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576 (1981). The court\ntold the jurors that, in order to establish the existence of\nsuch an enterprise, the Government had to prove that:\n\u201c(1) There [was] an ongoing organization with some sort of\nframework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objec\ntives; and (2) the various members and associates of the\nassociation function[ed] as a continuing unit to achieve a\ncommon purpose.\u201d App. 112.

Indeed, an enterprise need not have a\nname. Thus, an enterprise need not be a form[al] business entity such\nas a corporation, but may be merely an informal association of indi\nviduals. A group or association of people can be an \u2018enterprise\u2019 if,\namong other requirements, these individuals \u2018associate\u2019 together for a\npurpose of engaging in a course of conduct. Common sense sug\ngests that the existence of an association-in-fact is oftentimes more\nreadily proven by what it does, rather than by abstract analysis of its\nstructure.\n   \u201cMoreover, you may find an enterprise where an association of indi\nviduals, without structural hierarchy, forms solely for the purpose of\ncarrying out a pattern of racketeering acts. Such an association of\npersons may be established by evidence showing an ongoing organiza\ntion, formal or informal, and . . . by evidence that the people making up\nthe association functioned as a continuing unit. Therefore, in order to\nestablish the existence of such an enterprise, the government must\nprove that: (1) There is an ongoing organization with some sort of\nframework, formal or informal, for carrying out its objectives; and (2)\nthe various members and associates of the association function as a\ncontinuing unit to achieve a common purpose.\n   \u201cRegarding \u2018organization,\u2019 it is not necessary that the enterprise have\nany particular or formal structure, but it must have sufficient organiza\ntion that its members functioned and operated in a coordinated manner\nin order to carry out the alleged common purpose or purposes of the\nenterprise.\u201d App. 111\u2013113 (emphasis added).\n4                     BOYLE v.

UNITED STATES\n\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             B\n\n   As noted, the specific question on which we granted\ncertiorari is whether an association-in-fact enterprise\nmust have \u201can ascertainable structure beyond that inher\nent in the pattern of racketeering activity in which it\nengages.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. We will break this question into\nthree parts. First, must an association-in-fact enterprise\nhave a \u201cstructure\u201d? Second, must the structure be \u201cascer\ntainable\u201d? Third, must the \u201cstructure\u201d go \u201cbeyond that\ninherent in the pattern of racketeering activity\u201d in which\nits members engage?\n   \u201cStructure.\u201d We agree with petitioner that an associa\ntion-in-fact enterprise must have a structure. In the sense\nrelevant here, the term \u201cstructure\u201d means \u201c[t]he way in\nwhich parts are arranged or put together to form a whole\u201d\nand \u201c[t]he interrelation or arrangement of parts in a com\nplex entity.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 1718 (4th ed.\n2000); see also Random House Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 1410 (1967) (defining structure to mean, among\nother things, \u201cthe pattern of relationships, as of status or\nfriendship, existing among the members of a group or\nsociety\u201d).\n   From the terms of RICO, it is apparent that an associa\ntion-in-fact enterprise must have at least three structural\nfeatures: a purpose, relationships among those associated\nwith the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\none may not \u201cconduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the\nconduct of [an] enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d Whatever business-like characteristics the dissent has in\nmind, we do not see them in \u00a71962(c). Furthermore, Reves v. Ernst &\nYoung, 507 U. S. 170 (1993), is inapposite because that case turned on\nour interpretation of the participation requirement of \u00a71962, not the\ndefinition of \u201centerprise.\u201d See id., at 184\u2013185. In any case, it would be\nan interpretive stretch to deduce from the requirement that an enter\nprise must be \u201cdirected\u201d to impose the much broader, amorphous\nrequirement that it be \u201cbusiness-like.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthese associates to pursue the enterprise\u2019s purpose. As we\nsuccinctly put it in Turkette, an association-in-fact enter\nprise is \u201ca group of persons associated together for a com\nmon purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.\u201d 452\nU. S., at 583.\n   That an \u201centerprise\u201d must have a purpose is apparent\nfrom meaning of the term in ordinary usage, i.e., a \u201cven\nture,\u201d \u201cundertaking,\u201d or \u201cproject.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 757 (1976). The concept of \u201casso\nciat[ion]\u201d requires both interpersonal relationships and a\ncommon interest. See id., at 132 (defining \u201cassociation\u201d as\n\u201can organization of persons having a common interest\u201d);\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 156 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (defining\n\u201cassociation\u201d as a \u201ccollection of persons who have joined\ntogether for a certain object\u201d). Section 1962(c) reinforces\nthis conclusion and also shows that an \u201centerprise\u201d must\nhave some longevity, since the offense proscribed by that\nprovision demands proof that the enterprise had \u201caffairs\u201d\nof sufficient duration to permit an associate to \u201cpartici\npate\u201d in those affairs through \u201ca pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d\n   Although an association-in-fact enterprise must have\nthese structural features, it does not follow that a district\ncourt must use the term \u201cstructure\u201d in its jury instruc\ntions. A trial judge has considerable discretion in choosing\nthe language of an instruction so long as the substance of\nthe relevant point is adequately expressed.\n   \u201cAscertainable.\u201d Whenever a jury is told that it must\nfind the existence of an element beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, that element must be \u201cascertainable\u201d or else the\njury could not find that it was proved. Therefore, telling\nthe members of the jury that they had to ascertain the\nexistence of an \u201cascertainable structure\u201d would have been\nredundant and potentially misleading.\n   \u201cBeyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d This phrase may be interpreted in least two\n8                    BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent ways, and its correctness depends on the particu\nlar sense in which the phrase is used. If the phrase is\ninterpreted to mean that the existence of an enterprise is\na separate element that must be proved, it is of course\ncorrect. As we explained in Turkette, the existence of an\nenterprise is an element distinct from the pattern of rack\neteering activity and \u201cproof of one does not necessarily\nestablish the other.\u201d4 452 U. S., at 583.\n   On the other hand, if the phrase is used to mean that\nthe existence of an enterprise may never be inferred from\nthe evidence showing that persons associated with the\nenterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, it\nis incorrect. We recognized in Turkette that the evidence\nused to prove the pattern of racketeering activity and the\nevidence establishing an enterprise \u201cmay in particular\ncases coalesce.\u201d Ibid.\n                              C\n   The crux of petitioner\u2019s argument is that a RICO enter\nprise must have structural features in addition to those\nthat we think can be fairly inferred from the language of\nthe statute. Although petitioner concedes that an associa\ntion-in-fact enterprise may be an \u201c \u2018informal\u2019 \u201d group and\nthat \u201cnot \u2018much\u2019 \u201d structure is needed, Reply Brief for\nPetitioner 24, he contends that such an enterprise must\nhave at least some additional structural attributes, such\nas a structural \u201chierarchy,\u201d \u201crole differentiation,\u201d a\n\u201cunique modus operandi,\u201d a \u201cchain of command,\u201d \u201cprofes\nsionalism and sophistication of organization,\u201d \u201cdiversity\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 It is easy to envision situations in which proof that individuals en\n\ngaged in a pattern of racketeering activity would not establish the\nexistence of an enterprise. For example, suppose that several individu\nals, independently and without coordination, engaged in a pattern of\ncrimes listed as RICO predicates\u2014for example, bribery or extortion.\nProof of these patterns would not be enough to show that the individu\nals were members of an enterprise.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Such a group need not have a hierarchical struc\nture or a \u201cchain of command\u201d; decisions may be made on\nan ad hoc basis and by any number of methods\u2014by major\nity vote, consensus, a show of strength, etc. Members of\nthe group need not have fixed roles; different members\nmay perform different roles at different times. The group\nneed not have a name, regular meetings, dues, established\nrules and regulations, disciplinary procedures, or induc\ntion or initiation ceremonies. While the group must func\ntion as a continuing unit and remain in existence long\nenough to pursue a course of conduct, nothing in RICO\nexempts an enterprise whose associates engage in spurts\nof activity punctuated by periods of quiescence. Nor is the\nstatute limited to groups whose crimes are sophisticated,\ndiverse, complex, or unique; for example, a group that does\nnothing but engage in extortion through old-fashioned,\nunsophisticated, and brutal means may fall squarely\nwithin the statute\u2019s reach.\n   The breadth of the \u201centerprise\u201d concept in RICO is\nhighlighted by comparing the statute with other federal\nstatutes that target organized criminal groups. For exam\nple, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71955(b), which was enacted together with\nRICO as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970,\n84 Stat. 922, defines an \u201cillegal gambling business\u201d as one\nthat \u201cinvolves five or more persons who conduct, finance,\n10               BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmanage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such busi\nness.\u201d A \u201ccontinuing criminal enterprise,\u201d as defined in 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7848(c), must involve more than five persons who\nact in concert and must have an \u201corganizer,\u201d supervisor, or\nother manager. Congress included no such requirements\nin RICO.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   Contrary to petitioner\u2019s claims, rejection of his argu\nment regarding these structural characteristics does not\nlead to a merger of the crime proscribed by 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71962(c) (participating in the affairs of an enterprise\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity) and any of the\nfollowing offenses: operating a gambling business, \u00a71955;\nconspiring to commit one or more crimes that are listed as\nRICO predicate offenses, \u00a7371; or conspiring to violate the\nRICO statute, \u00a71962(d).\n   Proof that a defendant violated \u00a71955 does not necessar\nily establish that the defendant conspired to participate in\nthe affairs of a gambling enterprise through a pattern of\nracketeering activity. In order to prove the latter offense,\nthe prosecution must prove either that the defendant\ncommitted a pattern of \u00a71955 violations or a pattern of\nstate-law gambling crimes. See \u00a71961(1). No such proof is\nneeded to establish a simple violation of \u00a71955.\n   Likewise, proof that a defendant conspired to commit a\nRICO predicate offense\u2014for example, arson\u2014does not\nnecessarily establish that the defendant participated in\nthe affairs of an arson enterprise through a pattern of\narson crimes. Under \u00a7371, a conspiracy is an inchoate\ncrime that may be completed in the brief period needed for\nthe formation of the agreement and the commission of a\nsingle overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Feola, 420 U. S. 671, 694 (1975). Section\n1962(c) demands much more: the creation of an \u201center\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

The trial judge in this case committed two\nsignificant errors relating to the meaning of that term.\nFirst, he instructed the jury that \u201can association of indi\nviduals, without structural hierarchy, form[ed] solely for\nthe purpose of carrying out a pattern of racketeering acts\u201d\ncan constitute an enterprise.

UNITED STATES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nor participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.\u201d \u00a71962(c). The statute defines \u201centerprise\u201d to\ninclude \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation, associa\ntion, or other legal entity, and any union or group of indi\nviduals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d\n\u00a71961(4).\n   It is clear from the statute and our earlier decisions\nconstruing the term that Congress used \u201centerprise\u201d in\nthese provisions in the sense of \u201ca business organization,\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 757 (1976),\nrather than \u201ca \u2018venture,\u2019 \u2018undertaking,\u2019 or \u2018project,\u2019 \u201d ante,\nat 6 (quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Diction\nary, at 757). First, the terms \u201cindividual, partnership,\ncorporation, association, or other legal entity\u201d describe\nentities with formal legal structures most commonly es\ntablished for business purposes. \u00a71961(4). In context, the\nsubsequent reference to any \u201cunion or group of individuals\nassociated in fact although not a legal entity\u201d reflects an\nintended commonality between the legal and nonlegal\nentities included in the provision. Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\u201cThe juxtaposition of the two phrases suggests that \u2018asso\nciated in fact\u2019 just means structured without the aid of\nlegally defined structural forms such as the business\ncorporation.\u201d Limestone Development Corp. v. Lemont, 520\nF. 3d 797, 804\u2013805 (CA7 2008).1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 To\n       be sure, we have read RICO\u2019s enterprise term broadly to include\nentities with exclusively noneconomic motives or wholly unlawful\npurposes. See National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510\nU. S. 249, 252 (1994) (NOW); United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576,\n580\u2013581 (1981). But those holdings are consistent with the conclusion\nthat an enterprise is a business-like entity. Indeed, the examples of\nqualifying associations cited in Turkette\u2014including loan-sharking,\nproperty-fencing, drug-trafficking, and counterfeiting operations\u2014\nsatisfy that criterion, as each describes an organization with continuing\noperations directed toward providing goods or services to its customers.\nSee id., at 589\u2013590 (citing 84 Stat. 923; 116 Cong. Rec. 592 (1970)).\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 3\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n    That an enterprise must have business-like characteris\ntics is confirmed by the text of \u00a71962(c) and our decision in\nReves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170 (1993). Section\n1962(c) creates liability for \u201cconduct[ing] or participat[ing]\n. . . in the conduct of [an] enterprise\u2019s affairs through a\npattern of racketeering activity.\u201d In Reves, we examined\nthat provision\u2019s meaning and held that, \u201c[i]n order to\n\u2018participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such\nenterprise\u2019s affairs,\u2019 one must have some part in directing\nthose affairs.\u201d Id., at 179 (quoting \u00a71962(c)). It is not\nenough for a defendant to \u201ccarry on\u201d or \u201cparticipate in\u201d an\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity; instead, evidence that he operated, managed, or\ndirected those affairs is required. See id., at 177\u2013179.\nThis requirement confirms that the enterprise element\ndemands evidence of a certain quantum of business-like\norganization\u2014i.e., a system of processes, dealings, or other\naffairs that can be \u201cdirected.\u201d\n    Our cases also make clear that an enterprise \u201cis an\nentity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in\nwhich it engages.\u201d United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S.\n576, 583 (1981). As with the requirement that an enter\nprise have business-like characteristics, that an enterprise\nmust have a separate existence is confirmed by \u00a71962(c)\nand Reves. If an entity\u2019s existence consisted solely of its\nmembers\u2019 performance of a pattern of racketeering acts,\nthe \u201centerprise\u2019s affairs\u201d would be synonymous with the\n\u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d Section 1962(c) would\nthen prohibit an individual from conducting or participat\ning in \u201cthe conduct of [a pattern of racketeering activity]\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activity\u201d\u2014a reading\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSimilarly, the enterprise at issue in NOW was a nationwide network of\nantiabortion groups that had a leadership counsel and regular confer\nences and whose members undertook an extensive pattern of extortion,\narson, and other racketeering activity for the purpose of \u201cshut[ting]\ndown abortion clinics.\u201d 510 U. S., at 253.\n4                    BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthat is unbearably redundant, particularly in a case like\nthis one in which a single pattern of activity is alleged.\nThe only way to avoid that result is to require that an\n\u201centerprise\u2019s affairs\u201d be something other than the pattern\nof racketeering activity undertaken by its members.2\n   Recognizing an enterprise\u2019s business-like nature and its\ndistinctness from the pattern of predicate acts, however,\ndoes not answer the question of what proof each element\nrequires. In cases involving a legal entity, the matter of\nproving the enterprise element is straightforward, as the\nentity\u2019s legal existence will always be something apart\nfrom the pattern of activity performed by the defendant or\nhis associates. Cf. Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd. v.\nKing, 533 U. S. 158, 163 (2001). But in the case of an\nassociation-in-fact enterprise, the Government must ad\nduce other evidence of the entity\u2019s \u201cseparate\u201d existence\nand \u201congoing organization.\u201d Turkette, 452 U. S., at 583.\nThere may be cases in which a jury can infer that exis\ntence and continuity from the evidence used to establish\nthe pattern of racketeering activity. Ibid. But that will be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        other subsections of 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962 further demonstrate the\nbusiness-like nature of the enterprise element and its necessary dis\ntinctness from the pattern of racketeering activity. Subsection (a)\nprohibits anyone who receives income derived from a pattern of racket\neering activity from \u201cus[ing] or invest[ing], directly or indirectly, any\npart of such income . . . in acquisition of any interest in, or the estab\nlishment or operation of, any enterprise.\u201d And subsection (b) prohibits\nanyone from \u201cacquir[ing] or maintain[ing]\u201d any interest in or control of\nan enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. We noted in\nNOW that the term enterprise \u201cplays a different role in the structure\u201d\nof those subsections than it does in subsection (c) because the enter\nprise in those subsections is the victim. 510 U. S., at 258\u2013259. We did\nnot, however, suggest that the term has a substantially different\nmeaning in each subsection. To the contrary, our observation that the\nenterprise in subsection (c) is \u201cthe vehicle through which the unlawful\npattern of racketeering activity is committed,\u201d id., at 259, indicates\nthat, as in subsections (a) and (b), the enterprise must have an exis\ntence apart from the pattern of racketeering activity.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntrue only when the pattern of activity is so complex that it\ncould not be performed in the absence of structures or\nprocesses for planning or concealing the illegal conduct\nbeyond those inherent in performing the predicate acts.\nMore often, proof of an enterprise\u2019s separate existence will\nrequire different evidence from that used to establish the\npattern of predicate acts.\n   Precisely what proof is required in each case is a more\ndifficult question, largely due to the abundant variety of\nRICO predicates and enterprises. Because covered enter\nprises are necessarily business-like in nature, however,\nproof of an association-in-fact enterprise\u2019s separate exis\ntence will generally require evidence of rules, routines, or\nprocesses through which the entity maintains its continu\ning operations and seeks to conceal its illegal acts. As\npetitioner suggests, this requirement will usually be satis\nfied by evidence that the association has an \u201cascertainable\nstructure beyond that inherent in the pattern of racketeer\ning activity in which it engages.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Exam\nples of such structure include an organizational hierarchy,\na \u201cframework for making decisions,\u201d an \u201cinternal disci\npline mechanism,\u201d \u201cregular meetings,\u201d or a practice of\n\u201creinvest[ing] proceeds to promote and expand the enter\nprise.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 31\u201334. In other cases,\nthe enterprise\u2019s existence might be established through\nevidence that it provides goods or services to third parties,\nas such an undertaking will require organizational ele\nments more comprehensive than those necessary to per\nform a pattern of predicate acts. Thus, the evidence\nneeded to establish an enterprise will vary from case to\ncase, but in every case the Government must carry its\nburden of proving that an alleged enterprise has an exis\ntence separate from the pattern of racketeering activity\nundertaken by its constituents.\n6                 BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                             II\n   In some respects, my reading of the statute is not very\ndifferent from that adopted by the Court. We agree that\n\u201can association-in-fact enterprise must have at least three\nstructural features: a purpose, relationships among those\nassociated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to\npermit these associates to pursue the enterprise\u2019s pur\npose.\u201d Ante, at 6. But the Court stops short of giving\ncontent to that requirement. It states only that RICO\n\u201cdemands proof that the enterprise had \u2018affairs\u2019 of suffi\ncient duration to permit an associate to \u2018participate\u2019 in\nthose affairs through \u2018a pattern of racketeering activity,\u2019 \u201d\nbefore concluding that \u201c[a] trial judge has considerable\ndiscretion in choosing the language of an instruction\u201d and\nneed not use the term \u201cstructure.\u201d Ante, at 7. While I\nagree the word structure is not talismanic, I would hold\nthat the instructions must convey the requirement that\nthe alleged enterprise have an existence apart from the\nalleged pattern of predicate acts. The Court\u2019s decision, by\ncontrast, will allow juries to infer the existence of an\nenterprise in every case involving a pattern of racketeer\ning activity undertaken by two or more associates.\n   By permitting the Government to prove both elements\nwith the same evidence, the Court renders the enterprise\nrequirement essentially meaningless in association-in-fact\ncases. It also threatens to make that category of \u00a71962(c)\noffenses indistinguishable from conspiracies to commit\npredicate acts, see \u00a7371, as the only remaining difference\nis \u00a71962(c)\u2019s pattern requirement. The Court resists this\ncriticism, arguing that \u00a71962(c) \u201cdemands much more\u201d\nthan the inchoate offense defined in \u00a7371. Ante, at 10. It\nstates that the latter \u201cmay be completed in the brief period\nneeded for the formation of the agreement and the com\nmission of a single overt act in furtherance of the conspir\nacy,\u201d whereas the former requires the creation of \u201ca group\nwith a common purpose and course of conduct\u2014and the\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nactual commission of a pattern of predicate offenses.\u201d\nIbid. Given that it is also unlawful to conspire to violate\n\u00a71962(c), see \u00a71962(d), this comment provides no assur\nance that RICO and \u00a7371 offenses remain distinct. Only if\nproof of the enterprise element\u2014the \u201cgroup with a com\nmon purpose and course of conduct\u201d\u2014requires evidence of\nactivity or organization beyond that inherent in the pat\ntern of predicate acts will RICO offenses retain an identity\ndistinct from \u00a7371 offenses.\n  This case illustrates these concerns. The trial judge\ninstructed the jury that an enterprise need have only the\ndegree of organization necessary \u201cfor carrying out its\nobjectives\u201d and that it could \u201cfind an enterprise where an\nassociation of individuals, without structural hierarchy,\nforms solely for the purpose of carrying out a pattern of\nracketeering acts.\u201d App. 112.3 These instructions were\nplainly deficient, as they did not require the Government\nto prove that the alleged enterprise had an existence apart\nfrom the pattern of predicate acts. Instead, they permit\nted the Government\u2019s proof of the enterprise\u2019s structure\nand continuing nature\u2014requirements on which all\nagree\u2014to consist only of evidence that petitioner and his\nassociates performed a pattern of racketeering activity.\n  Petitioner\u2019s requested instruction would have required\nthe jury to find that the alleged enterprise \u201chad an ongo\ning organization, a core membership that functioned as a\ncontinuing unit, and an ascertainable structural hierarchy\ndistinct from the charged predicate acts.\u201d Id., at 95. That\ninstruction does not precisely track my understanding of\nthe statute; although evidence of \u201cstructural hierarchy\u201d\ncan evidence an enterprise, it is not necessary to establish\nthat element. Nevertheless, the proposed instruction\nwould have better directed the jury to consider whether\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For the full text of the relevant portion of the instructions, see ante,\n\nat 3, n. 1.\n8                BOYLE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe alleged enterprise possessed the separate existence\nnecessary to expose petitioner to liability under \u00a71962(c),\nand the trial judge should have considered an instruction\nalong those lines.\n   The trial judge also erred in finding the Government\u2019s\nevidence in this case sufficient to support petitioner\u2019s\nRICO convictions. Petitioner was alleged to have partici\npated and conspired to participate in the conduct of an\nenterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity consisting of one act of bank robbery and three\nacts of interstate transportation of stolen funds. Id., at\n15\u201319. The \u201cprimary goals\u201d of the alleged enterprise\n\u201cincluded generating money for its members and associ\nates through the commission of criminal activity, includ\ning bank robberies, bank burglaries and interstate trans\nportation of stolen money.\u201d Id., at 14. And its modus\noperandi was to congregate periodically when an associate\nhad a lead on a night-deposit box that the group could\nbreak into. Whoever among the associates was available\nwould bring screwdrivers, crowbars, and walkie-talkies to\nthe location. Some acted as lookouts, while others re\ntrieved the money. When the endeavor was successful, the\nparticipants would split the proceeds. Thus, the group\u2019s\npurpose and activities, and petitioner\u2019s participation\ntherein, were limited to sporadic acts of taking money\nfrom bank deposit boxes. There is no evidence in RICO\u2019s\ntext or history that Congress intended it to reach such\nad hoc associations of thieves.\n                             III\n  Because the instructions and evidence in this case did\nnot satisfy the requirement that an alleged enterprise\nhave an existence separate and apart from the pattern of\nactivity in which it engages, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
