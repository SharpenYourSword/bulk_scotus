Argued April 21, 2009\u2014Decided June 8, 2009\nPetitioner filed this qui tam action in the name of the United States\n  against respondent city and several of its officials under the False\n  Claims Act (FCA), 31 U. S. C. \u00a73729. The Government declined to\n  exercise its statutory right to intervene, the District Court dismissed\n  the complaint and entered judgment for respondents, and petitioner\n  filed a notice of appeal 54 days later. Federal Rule of Appellate Pro\n  cedure 4(a)(1)(A) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a72107(a) require, generally, that\n  such a notice be filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment, but\n  Rule 4(a)(1)(B) and \u00a72107(b) extend the period to 60 days when the\n  United States is a \u201cparty.\u201d The Second Circuit held that the 30-day\n  limit applied and dismissed petitioner\u2019s appeal as untimely.\nHeld: When the United States has declined to intervene in a privately\n initiated FCA action, it is not a \u201cparty\u201d to the litigation for purposes\n of either \u00a72107 or Rule 4. Because petitioner\u2019s time for filing a notice\n of appeal in this case was therefore 30 days, his appeal was untimely.\n Pp. 3\u20139.\n    (a) Although the United States is aware of and minimally involved\n in every FCA action, it is not a \u201cparty\u201d thereto unless it has brought\n the action or exercised its statutory right to intervene in the case.\n Indeed, intervention is the requisite method for a nonparty to become\n a party. See Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U. S. 301, 304. To hold otherwise\n would render the FCA\u2019s intervention provisions superfluous, contra\n dicting the requirement that statutes be construed in a manner that\n gives effect to all their provisions, see, e.g., Cooper Industries, Inc. v.\n Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 166.

Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Petitioner\u2019s arguments for designating the United States a\n    party in all FCA actions are unconvincing. First, neither the United\n    States\u2019 \u201creal party in interest\u201d status, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a),\n    nor the requirement that an FCA action be \u201cbrought in the name of\n    the Government,\u201d 31 U. S. C. \u00a73730(b)(1), converts the United States\n    into a \u201cparty\u201d where, as here, it has declined to bring the action or in\n    tervene. Second, the Government\u2019s right to receive pleadings and\n    deposition transcripts when it declines to intervene, see \u00a73730(c)(3),\n    does not support, but weighs against, petitioner\u2019s argument: If the\n    United States were a party to every FCA suit, it would already be en\n    titled to such materials under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.\n    Third, the fact that the United States is bound by the judgment in all\n    FCA actions regardless of its participation in the case is not a legiti\n    mate basis for disregarding the statute\u2019s intervention scheme. Fi\n    nally, given that Rule 4(a)(1)(B) hinges its 60-day time limit on the\n    United States\u2019 \u201cparty\u201d status, petitioner\u2019s contention that the limit\u2019s\n    underlying purpose would be best served by applying it in every FCA\n    case is unavailing.

CITY OF NEW YORK, \n\n               NEW YORK, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 8, 2009]\n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The question presented is whether the 30-day time limit\nto file a notice of appeal in Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 4(a)(1)(A) or the 60-day time limit in Rule\n4(a)(1)(B) applies when the United States declines to\nformally intervene in a qui tam action brought under the\nFalse Claims Act (FCA), 31 U. S. C. \u00a73729. The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that\nthe 30-day limit applies. We affirm.\n                              I\n  Petitioner Irwin Eisenstein and four New York City\n(City) employees filed this lawsuit against the City to\nchallenge a fee charged by the City to nonresident work\ners. They contended, inter alia, that the City deprived the\nUnited States of tax revenue that it otherwise would have\nreceived if the fee had not been deducted as an expense\nfrom the workers\u2019 taxable income. In their view, this\nviolated the FCA, which creates civil liability for \u201c[a]ny\nperson who knowingly presents, or causes to be presented,\nto an officer or employee of the United States Government\n2       UNITED STATES EX REL. EISENSTEIN v. CITY OF \n\n                       NEW YORK                             \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n. . . a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.\u201d\n\u00a73729(a)(1). Although the United States is a \u201creal party in\ninterest\u201d in a case brought under the FCA, Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 17(a), an FCA action does not need to be brought by\nthe United States. The FCA also allows \u201c[a] person [to]\nbring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the\nperson and for the United States Government,\u201d\n\u00a73730(b)(1). In a case brought by a person rather than the\nUnited States, the FCA grants the United States 60 days\nto review the claim and decide whether it will \u201celect to\nintervene and proceed with the action.\u201d \u00a73730(b)(2). After\nreviewing the complaint in this case, the United States\ndeclined to intervene but requested continued service of\nthe pleadings. The United States took no other action\nwith respect to the litigation. The District Court subse\nquently granted respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the com\nplaint and entered final judgment in their favor.\n    Petitioner filed a notice of appeal 54 days later. While\nthe appeal was pending, the Court of Appeals sua sponte\nordered the parties to brief the issue whether the notice of\nappeal had been timely filed. Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 4(a)(1)(A)\u2013(B) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72107(a)\u2013(b)\ngenerally require that a notice of appeal be filed within 30\ndays of the entry of judgment but extend the period to 60\ndays when \u201cthe United States or an officer or agency\nthereof is a party,\u201d \u00a72107(b). Petitioner argued that his\nappeal was timely filed under the 60-day limit because the\nUnited States is a \u201cparty\u201d to every FCA suit. Respondents\ncountered that the appeal was untimely under the 30-day\nlimit because the United States is not a party to an FCA\naction absent formal intervention or other meaningful\nparticipation.\n    The Court of Appeals agreed with respondents that the\n30-day limit applied and dismissed the appeal as un\ntimely. See 540 F. 3d 94 (CA2 2008). We granted certio\nrari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve division in the courts\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Although the United States is aware of\nand minimally involved in every FCA action, we hold that\nit is not a \u201cparty\u201d to an FCA action for purposes of the\nappellate filing deadline unless it has exercised its right to\nintervene in the case.2\n                           A\n  The FCA establishes a scheme that permits either the\nAttorney General, \u00a73730(a), or a private party, \u00a73730(b),\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Compare    Rodriguez v.

Under the collat\neral-order doctrine recognized by this Court in Cohen v. Beneficial\nIndustrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546\u2013547 (1949), the United States\nmay appeal, for example, the dismissal of an FCA action over its\nobjection. See 31 U. S. C. \u00a73730(b)(1); see also \u00a73730(c)(3); Marino v.\nOrtiz, 484 U. S. 301, 304 (1988) (per curiam) (noting that \u201cdenials of\n[motions to intervene] are, of course, appealable\u201d). In such a case, the\nGovernment is a party for purposes of appealing the specific order at\nissue even though it is not a party for purposes of the final judgment\nand Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B).\n4      UNITED STATES EX REL. EISENSTEIN v. CITY OF \n\n                      NEW YORK                                 \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto initiate a civil action alleging fraud on the Government.\nA private enforcement action under the FCA is called a\nqui tam action, with the private party referred to as the\n\u201crelator.\u201d Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United\nStates ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 769 (2000). When a\nrelator initiates such an action, the United States is given\n60 days to review the claim and decide whether it will\n\u201celect to intervene and proceed with the action,\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a73730(b)(2), 3730(b)(4); see also \u00a73730(c)(3) (permitting\nthe United States to intervene even after the expiration of\nthe 60-day period \u201cupon a showing of good cause\u201d).\n   If the United States intervenes, the relator has \u201cthe\nright to continue as a party to the action,\u201d but the United\nStates acquires the \u201cprimary responsibility for prosecuting\nthe action.\u201d \u00a73730(c)(1). If the United States declines to\nintervene, the relator retains \u201cthe right to conduct the\naction.\u201d \u00a73730(c)(3). The United States is thereafter\nlimited to exercising only specific rights during the pro\nceeding. These rights include requesting service of plead\nings and deposition transcripts, \u00a73730(c)(3), seeking to\nstay discovery that \u201cwould interfere with the Govern\nment\u2019s investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil\nmatter arising out of the same facts,\u201d \u00a73730(c)(4), and\nvetoing a relator\u2019s decision to voluntarily dismiss the\naction, \u00a73730(b)(1).\n   Petitioner nonetheless asserts that the Government is a\n\u201cparty\u201d to the action even when it has not exercised its\nright to intervene. We disagree. A \u201cparty\u201d to litigation is\n\u201c[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004). An individual may\nalso become a \u201cparty\u201d to a lawsuit by intervening in the\naction. See id., at 840 (defining \u201cintervention\u201d as \u201c[t]he\nlegal procedure by which . . . a third party is allowed to\nbecome a party to the litigation\u201d). As the Court long ago\nexplained, \u201c [w]hen the term [to intervene] is used in refer\nence to legal proceedings, it covers the right of one to\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpose in, or become a party to, a proceeding already\ninstituted. \u201d Rocca v. Thompson, 223 U. S. 317, 330 (1912)\n(emphasis added). The Court has further indicated that\nintervention is the requisite method for a nonparty to\nbecome a party to a lawsuit. See Marino v. Ortiz, 484\nU. S. 301, 304 (1988) (per curiam) (holding that \u201cwhen [a]\nnonparty has an interest that is affected by the trial\ncourt\u2019s judgment . . . the better practice is for such a non\nparty to seek intervention for purposes of appeal\u201d because\n\u201conly parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become\nparties, may appeal an adverse judgment\u201d (internal quota\ntion marks omitted; emphasis added)). The United States,\ntherefore, is a \u201cparty\u201d to a privately filed FCA action only\nif it intervenes in accordance with the procedures estab\nlished by federal law.\n   To hold otherwise would render the intervention provi\nsions of the FCA superfluous, as there would be no reason\nfor the United States to intervene in an action in which it\nis already a party. Such a holding would contradict well\nestablished principles of statutory interpretation that\nrequire statutes to be construed in a manner that gives\neffect to all of their provisions. See, e.g., Cooper Indus\ntries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 166 (2004);\nDole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 476\u2013477\n(2003). Congress expressly gave the United States discre\ntion to intervene in FCA actions\u2014a decision that requires\nconsideration of the costs and benefits of party status.\nSee, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(a) (requiring a party to\ndisclose certain information without awaiting any discov\nery request); Rule 34 (imposing obligations on parties\nserved with requests for production of information); Rule\n37 (providing for sanctions for noncompliance with certain\nparty obligations). The Court cannot disregard that con\ngressional assignment of discretion by designating the\nUnited States a \u201cparty\u201d even after it has declined to as\nsume the rights and burdens attendant to full party\n6            UNITED STATES EX REL.

First, petitioner\npoints to the United States\u2019 status as a \u201creal party in\ninterest\u201d in an FCA action and its right to a share of any\nresulting damages. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a); Ver\nmont Agency of Natural Resources, supra, at 772; see also\n6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure \u00a71545, pp. 351\u2013353 (2d ed. 1990) (\u201c[W]hen there\nhas been . . . a partial assignment the assignor and the\nassignee each retain an interest in the claim and are both\nreal parties in interest\u201d). But the United States\u2019 status as\na \u201creal party in interest\u201d in a qui tam action does not\nautomatically convert it into a \u201cparty.\u201d\n   The phrase, \u201creal party in interest,\u201d is a term of art\nutilized in federal law to refer to an actor with a substan\ntive right whose interests may be represented in litigation\nby another. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a); see also\nCts. Crim. App. Rule Prac. & Proc. 20(b), 44 M. J. LXXII\n(1996) (\u201cWhen an accused has not been named as a party,\nthe accused . . . shall be designated as the real party in\ninterest\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, at 1154 (defin\ning a \u201creal party in interest\u201d as \u201c[a] person entitled under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 This\n         Court\u2019s decision in Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U. S. 1 (2002), is\nnot to the contrary. There, the Court held that in a class-action suit, a\nclass member who was not a named party in the litigation could appeal\nthe approval of a settlement without formally intervening. See id., at\n6\u201314. But the Court\u2019s ruling was premised on the class-action nature of\nthe suit, see id., at 10\u201311, and specifically noted that party status\ndepends on \u201cthe applicability of various procedural rules that may\ndiffer based on context,\u201d id., at 10. For the reasons explained above, we\nconclude that in the specific context of the FCA, intervention is neces\nsary for the United States to obtain status as a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of\nRule 4(a)(1)(B).\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Conse\nquently, when, as here, a real party in interest has de\nclined to bring the action or intervene, there is no basis for\ndeeming it a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of Rule 4(a)(1)(B).\n   We likewise reject petitioner\u2019s related claim that the\nUnited States\u2019 party status for purposes of Rule 4(a)(1)(B)\nis controlled by the statutory requirement that an FCA\naction be \u201cbrought in the name of the Government.\u201d 31\nU. S. C. \u00a73730(b)(1). A person or entity can be named in\nthe caption of a complaint without necessarily becoming a\nparty to the action. See 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a71321, p. 388 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201c[T]he\ncaption is not determinative as to the identity of the par\nties to the action\u201d). And here, it would make little sense to\ninterpret the naming requirement of \u00a73730(b)(1) to dis\npense with the specific procedures for intervention pro\nvided elsewhere in the statute.\n   Second, petitioner relies on the Government\u2019s right to\nreceive pleadings and deposition transcripts in cases\nwhere it declines to intervene, see \u00a73730(c)(3). But the\nexistence of this right, if anything, weighs against peti\ntioner\u2019s argument. If the United States were a party to\nevery FCA suit, it would already be entitled to such mate\n8      UNITED STATES EX REL. EISENSTEIN v.

But this fact is not\ndeterminative; nonparties may be bound by a judgment for\na host of different reasons. See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9\u201314) (describing \u201csix\nestablished categories\u201d in which a nonparty may be bound\nby a judgment); see also Restatement (Second) of Judg\nments \u00a741(1)(d), p. 393 (1980) (noting that a nonparty may\nbe bound by a judgment obtained by a party who, inter\nalia, is \u201can official or agency invested by law with author\nity to represent the person\u2019s interests\u201d). If the United\nStates believes that its rights are jeopardized by an ongo\ning qui tam action, the FCA provides for intervention\u2014\nincluding \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d after the expiration of\nthe 60-day review period. The fact that the Government is\nbound by the judgment is not a legitimate basis for disre\ngarding this statutory scheme.\n   Finally, petitioner contends that the underlying purpose\nof the 60-day time limit would be best served by applying\nRule 4(a)(1)(B) in every FCA case. The purpose of the\nextended 60-day limit in cases where the United States is\na party, he claims, is to provide the Government with\nsufficient time to review a case and decide whether to\nappeal. Petitioner contends that, even in cases where the\nGovernment did not intervene before the district court\nissued its decision, the Government may want to intervene\nfor purposes of appeal, and should have the full 60 days to\ndecide. But regardless of the purpose of Rule 4(a)(1)(B)\nand the convenience that additional time may provide to\nthe Government, this Court cannot ignore the Rule\u2019s text,\nwhich hinges the applicability of the 60-day period on the\nrequirement that the United States be a \u201cparty\u201d to the\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Because peti\ntioner\u2019s time for filing a notice of appeal in this case was\ntherefore 30 days, his appeal was untimely.

See\nBrief for Petitioner 25\u201327. As an initial matter, it is unclear how many\npending cases are implicated by petitioner\u2019s concern as such cases\nwould have to involve parties who waited more than 30 days to appeal\nfrom the judgment in an FCA case in which the United States declined\nto intervene. But to the extent that there are such cases, the Court\nmust nonetheless decide the jurisdictional question before it irrespec\ntive of the possibility of harsh consequences. See Torres v.

Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Petitioner\u2019s arguments for designating the United States a\n    party in all FCA actions are unconvincing. First, neither the United\n    States\u2019 \u201creal party in interest\u201d status, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a),\n    nor the requirement that an FCA action be \u201cbrought in the name of\n    the Government,\u201d 31 U. S. C. \u00a73730(b)(1), converts the United States\n    into a \u201cparty\u201d where, as here, it has declined to bring the action or in\n    tervene. Second, the Government\u2019s right to receive pleadings and\n    deposition transcripts when it declines to intervene, see \u00a73730(c)(3),\n    does not support, but weighs against, petitioner\u2019s argument: If the\n    United States were a party to every FCA suit, it would already be en\n    titled to such materials under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.\n    Third, the fact that the United States is bound by the judgment in all\n    FCA actions regardless of its participation in the case is not a legiti\n    mate basis for disregarding the statute\u2019s intervention scheme. Fi\n    nally, given that Rule 4(a)(1)(B) hinges its 60-day time limit on the\n    United States\u2019 \u201cparty\u201d status, petitioner\u2019s contention that the limit\u2019s\n    underlying purpose would be best served by applying it in every FCA\n    case is unavailing.

They contended, inter alia, that the City deprived the\nUnited States of tax revenue that it otherwise would have\nreceived if the fee had not been deducted as an expense\nfrom the workers\u2019 taxable income.

Although the United States is a \u201creal party in\ninterest\u201d in a case brought under the FCA, Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 17(a), an FCA action does not need to be brought by\nthe United States.

After\nreviewing the complaint in this case, the United States\ndeclined to intervene but requested continued service of\nthe pleadings. The United States took no other action\nwith respect to the litigation. The District Court subse\nquently granted respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the com\nplaint and entered final judgment in their favor.\n    Petitioner filed a notice of appeal 54 days later. While\nthe appeal was pending, the Court of Appeals sua sponte\nordered the parties to brief the issue whether the notice of\nappeal had been timely filed.

C. \u00a7\u00a72107(a)\u2013(b)\ngenerally require that a notice of appeal be filed within 30\ndays of the entry of judgment but extend the period to 60\ndays when \u201cthe United States or an officer or agency\nthereof is a party,\u201d \u00a72107(b). Petitioner argued that his\nappeal was timely filed under the 60-day limit because the\nUnited States is a \u201cparty\u201d to every FCA suit. Respondents\ncountered that the appeal was untimely under the 30-day\nlimit because the United States is not a party to an FCA\naction absent formal intervention or other meaningful\nparticipation.\n    The Court of Appeals agreed with respondents that the\n30-day limit applied and dismissed the appeal as un\ntimely.

S. 301, 304 (1988) (per curiam) (holding that \u201cwhen [a]\nnonparty has an interest that is affected by the trial\ncourt\u2019s judgment . . . the better practice is for such a non\nparty to seek intervention for purposes of appeal\u201d because\n\u201conly parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become\nparties, may appeal an adverse judgment\u201d (internal quota\ntion marks omitted; emphasis added)). The United States,\ntherefore, is a \u201cparty\u201d to a privately filed FCA action only\nif it intervenes in accordance with the procedures estab\nlished by federal law.\n   To hold otherwise would render the intervention provi\nsions of the FCA superfluous, as there would be no reason\nfor the United States to intervene in an action in which it\nis already a party. Such a holding would contradict well\nestablished principles of statutory interpretation that\nrequire statutes to be construed in a manner that gives\neffect to all of their provisions. See, e.g., Cooper Indus\ntries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 166 (2004);\nDole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 476\u2013477\n(2003).

CITY OF \n\n                            NEW YORK                                          \n\n                        Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstatus.3\n                              B\n   Petitioner\u2019s arguments that the United States should be\ndesignated a party in all FCA actions irrespective of its\ndecision to intervene are unconvincing. First, petitioner\npoints to the United States\u2019 status as a \u201creal party in\ninterest\u201d in an FCA action and its right to a share of any\nresulting damages. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a); Ver\nmont Agency of Natural Resources, supra, at 772; see also\n6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and\nProcedure \u00a71545, pp. 351\u2013353 (2d ed. 1990) (\u201c[W]hen there\nhas been . . . a partial assignment the assignor and the\nassignee each retain an interest in the claim and are both\nreal parties in interest\u201d). But the United States\u2019 status as\na \u201creal party in interest\u201d in a qui tam action does not\nautomatically convert it into a \u201cparty.\u201d\n   The phrase, \u201creal party in interest,\u201d is a term of art\nutilized in federal law to refer to an actor with a substan\ntive right whose interests may be represented in litigation\nby another. See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 17(a); see also\nCts. Crim. App. Rule Prac. & Proc. 20(b), 44 M. J. LXXII\n(1996) (\u201cWhen an accused has not been named as a party,\nthe accused . . . shall be designated as the real party in\ninterest\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, at 1154 (defin\ning a \u201creal party in interest\u201d as \u201c[a] person entitled under\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 This\n         Court\u2019s decision in Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U. S. 1 (2002), is\nnot to the contrary. There, the Court held that in a class-action suit, a\nclass member who was not a named party in the litigation could appeal\nthe approval of a settlement without formally intervening. See id., at\n6\u201314. But the Court\u2019s ruling was premised on the class-action nature of\nthe suit, see id., at 10\u201311, and specifically noted that party status\ndepends on \u201cthe applicability of various procedural rules that may\ndiffer based on context,\u201d id., at 10. For the reasons explained above, we\nconclude that in the specific context of the FCA, intervention is neces\nsary for the United States to obtain status as a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of\nRule 4(a)(1)(B).\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe substantive law to enforce the right sued upon and\nwho generally . . . benefits from the action\u2019s final out\ncome\u201d). Congress\u2019 choice of the term \u201cparty\u201d in Rule\n4(a)(1)(B) and \u00a72107(b), and not the distinctive phrase,\n\u201creal party in interest,\u201d indicates that the 60-day time\nlimit applies only when the United States is an actual\n\u201cparty\u201d in qui tam actions\u2014and not when the United\nStates holds the status of \u201creal party in interest.\u201d Cf.\nBarnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 452 (2002)\n(\u201c[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Conse\nquently, when, as here, a real party in interest has de\nclined to bring the action or intervene, there is no basis for\ndeeming it a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of Rule 4(a)(1)(B).\n   We likewise reject petitioner\u2019s related claim that the\nUnited States\u2019 party status for purposes of Rule 4(a)(1)(B)\nis controlled by the statutory requirement that an FCA\naction be \u201cbrought in the name of the Government.\u201d 31\nU. S. C. \u00a73730(b)(1). A person or entity can be named in\nthe caption of a complaint without necessarily becoming a\nparty to the action. See 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a71321, p. 388 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201c[T]he\ncaption is not determinative as to the identity of the par\nties to the action\u201d). And here, it would make little sense to\ninterpret the naming requirement of \u00a73730(b)(1) to dis\npense with the specific procedures for intervention pro\nvided elsewhere in the statute.\n   Second, petitioner relies on the Government\u2019s right to\nreceive pleadings and deposition transcripts in cases\nwhere it declines to intervene, see \u00a73730(c)(3). But the\nexistence of this right, if anything, weighs against peti\ntioner\u2019s argument. If the United States were a party to\nevery FCA suit, it would already be entitled to such mate\n8      UNITED STATES EX REL. EISENSTEIN v. CITY OF \n\n                      NEW YORK                             \n\n                  Opinion of the Court \n\n\nrials under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5, thus leaving\nno need for a separate provision preserving this basic right\nof litigation for the Government.\n   Third, petitioner relies on the fact that the United\nStates is bound by the judgment in all FCA actions regard\nless of its participation in the case. But this fact is not\ndeterminative; nonparties may be bound by a judgment for\na host of different reasons. See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9\u201314) (describing \u201csix\nestablished categories\u201d in which a nonparty may be bound\nby a judgment); see also Restatement (Second) of Judg\nments \u00a741(1)(d), p. 393 (1980) (noting that a nonparty may\nbe bound by a judgment obtained by a party who, inter\nalia, is \u201can official or agency invested by law with author\nity to represent the person\u2019s interests\u201d). If the United\nStates believes that its rights are jeopardized by an ongo\ning qui tam action, the FCA provides for intervention\u2014\nincluding \u201cfor good cause shown\u201d after the expiration of\nthe 60-day review period. The fact that the Government is\nbound by the judgment is not a legitimate basis for disre\ngarding this statutory scheme.\n   Finally, petitioner contends that the underlying purpose\nof the 60-day time limit would be best served by applying\nRule 4(a)(1)(B) in every FCA case. The purpose of the\nextended 60-day limit in cases where the United States is\na party, he claims, is to provide the Government with\nsufficient time to review a case and decide whether to\nappeal. Petitioner contends that, even in cases where the\nGovernment did not intervene before the district court\nissued its decision, the Government may want to intervene\nfor purposes of appeal, and should have the full 60 days to\ndecide. But regardless of the purpose of Rule 4(a)(1)(B)\nand the convenience that additional time may provide to\nthe Government, this Court cannot ignore the Rule\u2019s text,\nwhich hinges the applicability of the 60-day period on the\nrequirement that the United States be a \u201cparty\u201d to the\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\naction.4\n                             III\n   We hold that when the United States has declined to\nintervene in a privately initiated FCA action, it is not a\n\u201cparty\u201d to the litigation for purposes of either \u00a72107 or\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4. Because peti\ntioner\u2019s time for filing a notice of appeal in this case was\ntherefore 30 days, his appeal was untimely. The judgment\nof the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Petitioner contends that the uncertainty regarding Rule 4(a)(1)(B)\n\nhas created a \u201ctra[p] for the unwary,\u201d and that our decision will un\nfairly punish those who relied on the holdings of courts adopting the 60\nday limit in cases in which the United States was not a party. See\nBrief for Petitioner 25\u201327. As an initial matter, it is unclear how many\npending cases are implicated by petitioner\u2019s concern as such cases\nwould have to involve parties who waited more than 30 days to appeal\nfrom the judgment in an FCA case in which the United States declined\nto intervene. But to the extent that there are such cases, the Court\nmust nonetheless decide the jurisdictional question before it irrespec\ntive of the possibility of harsh consequences. See Torres v. Oakland\nScavenger Co., 487 U. S. 312, 318 (1988) (\u201cWe recognize that construing\nRule3(c) [of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure] as a jurisdic\ntional prerequisite leads to a harsh result in this case, but we are\nconvinced that the harshness of our construction is \u2018imposed by the\nlegislature and not the judicial process\u2019 \u201d (quoting Schiavone v. Fortune,\n477 U. S. 21, 31 (1986))).\n</pre>",
