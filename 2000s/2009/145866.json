Argued March 25, 2009\u2014Decided June 8, 2009\nMilitary authorities charged respondent, a native Nigerian serving in\n the U. S. Navy, with violating of the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n (UCMJ). With counsel\u2019s assistance, respondent agreed to plead\n guilty to reduced charges. The special court-martial accepted the\n plea and convicted and sentenced respondent; the Navy-Marine\n Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA) affirmed; and he was dis\n charged from the Navy in 2000. In 2006, the Department of Home\n land Security commenced removal proceedings against respondent\n based on the conviction. To avoid deportation, he filed a petition for a\n writ of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs Act, asking\n the NMCCA to vacate the conviction it had earlier affirmed on the\n ground that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of\n counsel, who had assured him his plea bargain carried no risk of de\n portation. Though rejecting the Government\u2019s contention that it\n lacked jurisdiction to grant the writ, the NMCCA denied relief for\n lack of merit. Agreeing that the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the Court\n of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) remanded for further pro\n ceedings on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n \u00a71259(4), which permits it to review CAAF decisions in cases \u201cin\n which [that court] granted relief.\u201d Respondent\u2019s parsimonious view\n that the CAAF did not \u201c \u2018gran[t] relief\u2019 \u201d in this case, but simply re\n manded to the NMCCA, is rejected. Though \u00a71259 does not define\n \u201crelief,\u201d the word\u2019s familiar meaning encompasses any redress or\n benefit provided by a court. The CAAF\u2019s judgment reversing the\n NMCCA satisfies that definition. Pp. 4\u20135.\n    2.

As recognized by the All Writs\n    Act\u2014which permits \u201ccourts established by Act of Congress\u201d to issue\n    \u201call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic\n    tions,\u201d 28 U.

Such jurisdiction is deter\n    mined by Congress. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212. Thus, to\n    issue respondent a writ of coram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must\n    have had statutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent\u2019s\n    original judgment of conviction. Pp. 5\u20138.\n          (b) Pursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA and the CAAF have sub\n    ject-matter jurisdiction over this case. The NMCCA has jurisdiction\n    to entertain respondent\u2019s coram nobis request under UCMJ Article\n    66, which provides: \u201cFor the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases,\n    the [NMCCA] may sit . . . .\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7866(a). Because respon\n    dent\u2019s coram nobis request is simply a further \u201cstep in [his] criminal\u201d\n    appeal, United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 505 n. 4, the\n    NMCCA\u2019s jurisdiction to issue the writ derives from the earlier juris\n    diction it exercised under \u00a7866(a) to hear and determine the convic\n    tion\u2019s validity on direct review. Respondent\u2019s coram nobis request is\n    not barred by the requirement that the NMCCA \u201cact only with re\n    spect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening au\n    thority.\u201d \u00a7866(c). An alleged error in the original judgment predi\n    cated on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenges the conviction\u2019s\n    validity, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at ___, so respondent\u2019s\n    Sixth Amendment claim is \u201cwith respect to\u201d the special-court\n    martial\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d of guilty. Because the NMCCA has jurisdiction,\n    the CAAF has jurisdiction to review the NMCCA\u2019s denial of respon\n    dent\u2019s petition challenging the validity of his original conviction.\n    That the CAAF\u2019s authority is confined \u201cto matters of law\u201d connected\n    to \u201cthe findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority\n    and as affirmed or set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeals,\u201d\n    \u00a7867(c), poses no obstacle to respondent\u2019s requested review.

JACOB DENEDO\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE ARMED FORCES\n\n                                 [June 8, 2009]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The case before us presents a single issue: whether an\nArticle I military appellate court has jurisdiction to enter\ntain a petition for a writ of error coram nobis to challenge\nits earlier, and final, decision affirming a criminal convic\ntion. The military court which had affirmed the conviction\nand where the writ of coram nobis was sought is the Navy-\nMarine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA). Its\nruling that it had jurisdiction to grant the writ, but then\ndenying its issuance for lack of merit, was appealed to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\n(CAAF). After the CAAF agreed that the NMCCA has\njurisdiction to issue the writ, it remanded for further\nproceedings on the merits. The Government of the United\nStates, contending that a writ of coram nobis directed to a\nfinal judgment of conviction is beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe military courts, now brings the case to us.\n                            I\n  Respondent Jacob Denedo came to the United States in\n1984 from his native Nigeria. He enlisted in the Navy in\n1989 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1990. In\n1998, military authorities charged him with conspiracy,\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlarceny, and forgery\u2014in contravention of Articles 81, 121,\nand 123 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7881, 921, 923\u2014all for his role in a scheme to\ndefraud a community college. With the assistance of both\nmilitary and civilian counsel, respondent made a plea\nbargain to plead guilty to reduced charges. In exchange\nfor his plea the convening authority referred respondent\u2019s\ncase to a special court-martial, \u00a7819, which, at that time,\ncould not impose a sentence greater than six months\u2019\nconfinement.\n    The special court-martial, consisting of a single military\njudge, accepted respondent\u2019s guilty plea after determining\nthat it was both knowing and voluntary. The court con\nvicted respondent of conspiracy and larceny. It sentenced\nhim to three months\u2019 confinement, a bad-conduct dis\ncharge, and a reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade.\nRespondent appealed on the ground that his sentence was\nunduly severe. The NMCCA affirmed. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 64a\u201367a. Respondent did not seek further review in\nthe CAAF, and he was discharged from the Navy on May\n30, 2000.\n    In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security com\nmenced removal proceedings against respondent based\nupon his special court-martial conviction. To avoid depor\ntation, respondent decided to challenge his conviction once\nmore, though at this point it had been final for eight years.\nHe maintained, in a petition for a writ of coram nobis filed\nwith the NMCCA, that the conviction it had earlier af\nfirmed must be deemed void because his guilty plea was\nthe result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Respondent\nalleged that he informed his civilian attorney during plea\nnegotiations that \u201c \u2018his primary concern and objective\u2019 \u201d\nwas to avoid deportation and that he was willing to \u201c \u2018risk\n. . . going to jail\u2019 \u201d to avert separation from his family. 66\nM.

Petitioner argued that the\nNMCCA could set aside its earlier decision by issuing a\nwrit of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs\nAct, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a).\n   The Government filed a motion to dismiss for want of\njurisdiction. It contended that the NMCCA had no author\nity to conduct postconviction proceedings. In a terse, four\nsentence order, the NMCCA summarily denied both the\nGovernment\u2019s motion and respondent\u2019s petition for a writ\nof coram nobis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a. Respondent\nappealed and the CAAF, dividing 3 to 2, affirmed in part\nand reversed in part. The CAAF agreed with the NMCCA\nthat standing military courts have jurisdiction to conduct\n\u201ccollateral review under the All Writs Act.\u201d 66 M. J., at\n119. This is so, the CAAF explained, because \u201cwhen a\npetitioner seeks collateral relief to modify an action that\nwas taken within the subject matter jurisdiction of the\nmilitary justice system . . . a writ that is necessary or\nappropriate may be issued under the All Writs Act \u2018in aid\nof\u2019 the court\u2019s existing jurisdiction.\u201d Id., at 120 (citing 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71651(a)).\n   Satisfied that it had jurisdiction, the CAAF next turned\nto whether the writ of coram nobis should issue. It held\nthat a nondefaulted, ineffective-assistance claim that was\nyet to receive a full and fair review \u201cwithin the military\njustice system\u201d could justify issuance of the writ. 66 M. J.,\nat 125. Finding that respondent\u2019s ineffective-assistance\nclaim satisfied \u201cthe threshold criteria for coram nobis\nreview,\u201d the CAAF remanded to the NMCCA so it could\nascertain in the first instance \u201cwhether the merits of\n[respondent\u2019s] petition can be resolved on the basis of the\nwritten submissions, or whether a factfinding hearing is\nrequired.\u201d Id., at 126, 130.\n4                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Judge Stucky filed a dissenting opinion. Assuming that\nthe majority had correctly determined its jurisdiction to\ngrant the requested relief, he concluded that respondent\u2019s\nineffective-assistance claim lacked merit. Id., at 131.\nJudge Ryan also dissented. Reasoning that the majority\nhad misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Clinton v. Gold\nsmith, 526 U. S. 529 (1999), she concluded that the UCMJ\ndoes not confer jurisdiction upon military tribunals to\nconduct \u201cpost-finality collateral review.\u201d 66 M. J., at 136.\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\naffirm.\n                             II\n   Before we address another court\u2019s subject-matter juris\ndiction we must first determine our own. See Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, ante, at 6 (\u201cSubject-matter jurisdiction . . . should be\nconsidered when fairly in doubt\u201d). The Government, upon\nwhich the burden to demonstrate subject-matter jurisdic\ntion lies, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332,\n342 (2006), claims that our power to hear this appeal rests\non 28 U. S. C. \u00a71259(4). That jurisdictional provision\npermits us to review CAAF decisions in \u201c \u2018cases . . . in\nwhich the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces . . .\ngranted relief.\u2019 \u201d Respondent maintains that we lack\njurisdiction because the CAAF did not \u201c \u2018grant relief\u2019 \u201d; \u201call\nit did was remand\u201d to the NMCCA. Brief for Respondent\n6\u20137 (brackets omitted).\n   Respondent\u2019s parsimonious construction of the word\n\u201crelief\u201d need not detain us long. Though \u00a71259 does not\ndefine the term, its familiar meaning encompasses any\n\u201credress or benefit\u201d provided by a court. Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1317 (8th ed. 2004). The CAAF\u2019s judgment\nreversing the NMCCA satisfies that definition. The\nNMCCA denied respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of coram\nnobis, while the CAAF\u2019s decision reversed and remanded\nso that the NMCCA could determine anew if the writ\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nshould issue. That decision conferred a palpable benefit\non respondent; for a chance of success on the merits, how\never slight, is superior to no possibility at all.\n  To be sure, respondent would have preferred the CAAF\nto issue a writ of coram nobis or to direct the NMCCA to\ndo so rather than remanding for the NMCCA to conduct\nfurther proceedings. We have jurisdiction, however, to\nreview any decision granting \u201crelief,\u201d not just those provid\ning \u201cultimate relief\u201d or \u201ccomplete relief.\u201d Indeed, appellate\ncourts reverse and remand lower court judgments\u2014rather\nthan issuing complete relief\u2014with regularity. See, e.g.,\nArthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, ante, at ___; FCC v. Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., ante, at ___. There is no merit to\nthe view that a decision granting partial relief should be\nconstrued as granting no relief at all.\n  Because the CAAF \u201cgranted relief\u201d to respondent, the\ntext of \u00a71259 is satisfied here. We have jurisdiction to\ndetermine whether the CAAF was correct in ruling that\nthe NMCCA had authority to entertain the petition for a\nwrit of coram nobis.\n                             III\n                              A\n  The writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law\nremedy designed \u201cto correct errors of fact.\u201d United States\nv. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 507 (1954). In American juris\nprudence the precise contours of coram nobis have not\nbeen \u201cwell defined,\u201d Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410,\n416 (1882), but the writ traces its origins to the King\u2019s\nBench and the Court of Common Pleas. United States v.\nPlumer, 27 F. Cas. 561, 573 (No. 16,056) (CC Mass. 1859)\n(opinion for the court by Clifford, Circuit Justice); see also\nMorgan, supra, at 507, n. 9 (citing 2 W. Tidd, Practice of\nCourts of King\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas *1136\u2013*1137).\nIn English practice the office of the writ was to foster\nrespect for judicial rulings by enabling the same court\n6               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cwhere the action was commenced and where the judg\nment was rendered\u201d to avoid the rigid strictures of judg\nment finality by correcting technical errors \u201csuch as hap\npened through the fault of the clerk in the record of the\nproceedings prior to the judgment.\u201d Plumer, supra, at\n572\u2013573.\n   Any rationale confining the writ to technical errors,\nhowever, has been superseded; for in its modern iteration\ncoram nobis is broader than its common-law predecessor.\nThis is confirmed by our opinion in Morgan. In that case\nwe found that a writ of coram nobis can issue to redress a\nfundamental error, there a deprivation of counsel in viola\ntion of the Sixth Amendment, as opposed to mere technical\nerrors. 346 U. S., at 513. The potential universe of cases\nthat range from technical errors to fundamental ones\nperhaps illustrates, in the case of coram nobis, the \u201cten\ndency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its\nlogic.\u201d B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 51\n(1921). To confine the use of coram nobis so that finality\nis not at risk in a great number of cases, we were careful\nin Morgan to limit the availability of the writ to \u201cextraor\ndinary\u201d cases presenting circumstances compelling its use\n\u201cto achieve justice.\u201d 346 U. S., at 511. Another limit, of\ncourse, is that an extraordinary remedy may not issue\nwhen alternative remedies, such as habeas corpus, are\navailable. See id., at 510\u2013511.\n   In federal courts the authority to grant a writ of coram\nnobis is conferred by the All Writs Act, which permits\n\u201ccourts established by Act of Congress\u201d to issue \u201call writs\nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic\ntions.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a). Though military courts, like\nArticle III tribunals, are empowered to issue extraordi\nnary writs under the All Writs Act, Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969), that authority does not deter\nmine the anterior question whether military courts have\njurisdiction to entertain a petition for coram nobis.

Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212 (2007) (\u201cWithin\nconstitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the\nfederal courts have jurisdiction to consider\u201d). This rule\napplies with added force to Article I tribunals, such as the\nNMCCA and CAAF, which owe their existence to Con\ngress\u2019 authority to enact legislation pursuant to Art. I, \u00a78\nof the Constitution. Goldsmith, 526 U. S., at 533\u2013534.\n   Our decision in Goldsmith demonstrates these teach\nings. There an Air Force officer, James Goldsmith, was\nconvicted of various crimes by general court-martial and\nsentenced to six years\u2019 confinement. Id., at 531. Follow\ning his conviction, Congress enacted a statute authorizing\nthe President to drop convicted officers from the rolls of\nthe Armed Forces. When the Air Force notified Goldsmith\nthat he would be dropped from the rolls, he lodged a peti\ntion before the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals\n(AFCCA) claiming that the proposed action contravened\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. Id., at 532\u2013\n533. Goldsmith sought extraordinary relief as authorized\nby the All Writs Act to enjoin the President from removing\nhim from the rolls. The AFCCA denied relief, but the\nCAAF granted it.\n   Concluding that the UCMJ does not authorize military\ncourts to review executive action\u2014including a decision to\ndrop an officer from the rolls\u2014we held that the AFCCA\nand the CAAF lacked jurisdiction over Goldsmith\u2019s case.\nId., at 535. This was so, we unequivocally found, irrespec\ntive of the military court\u2019s authority to issue extraordinary\nrelief pursuant to the All Writs Act and its previous juris\n8                 UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndiction over Goldsmith\u2019s criminal proceeding. The power\nto issue relief depends upon, rather than enlarges, a\ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction. Id., at 536\u2013537.\n   That principle does not control the question before us.\nBecause coram nobis is but an extraordinary tool to cor\nrect a legal or factual error, an application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired.\nSee Morgan, supra, at 505, n. 4 (coram nobis is \u201ca step in\nthe criminal case and not, like habeas corpus where relief\nis sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a\nseparate civil proceeding\u201d); see also United States v. Beg\ngerly, 524 U. S. 38, 46 (1998) (citing Pacific R. Co. of Mo. v.\nMissouri Pacific R. Co., 111 U. S. 505, 522 (1884) (noting\nthat an \u201cindependent action\u201d\u2014which, like coram nobis, is\nan equitable means to obtain relief from a judgment\u2014\n\u201c \u2018may be regarded as ancillary to the prior suit, so that the\nrelief asked may be granted by the court which made the\ndecree in that suit . . . . The bill, though an original bill in\nthe chancery sense of the word, is a continuation of the\nformer suit, on the question of the jurisdiction of the\n[court]\u2019 \u201d). It follows that to issue respondent a writ of\ncoram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must have had\nstatutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent\u2019s\noriginal judgment of conviction.\n                                B\n   In the critical part of its opinion discussing the jurisdic\ntion and authority of the NMCCA to issue a writ of coram\nnobis in an appropriate case, the CAAF describes respon\ndent\u2019s request for review as one \u201cunder the All Writs Act.\u201d\n66 M. J., at 119. This is correct, of course, if it simply\nconfirms that the Act authorizes federal courts to issue\nwrits \u201cin aid of\u201d their jurisdiction; but it does not advance\nthe inquiry into whether jurisdiction exists.\n   And there are limits to the use of coram nobis to alter or\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpret earlier judgments. As Goldsmith makes plain,\nthe All Writs Act and the extraordinary relief the statute\nauthorizes are not a source of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n526 U. S., at 534\u2013535. Statutes which address the power\nof a court to use certain writs or remedies or to decree\ncertain forms of relief, for instance to award damages in\nsome specified measure, in some circumstances might be\nconstrued also as a grant of jurisdiction to hear and de\ntermine the underlying cause of action. Cf. Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). We have long held, how\never, that the All Writs Act should not be interpreted in\nthis way. Goldsmith, supra, at 536; Plumer, 27 F. Cas., at\n574 (jurisdiction cannot be acquired \u201cby means of the writ\nto be issued\u201d). The authority to issue a writ under the All\nWrits Act is not a font of jurisdiction. See Syngenta Crop\nProtection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U. S. 28, 31 (2002).\n   Quite apart from the All Writs Act, we conclude that the\nNMCCA has jurisdiction to entertain respondent\u2019s request\nfor a writ of coram nobis. Article 66 of the UCMJ pro\nvides: \u201cFor the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases,\nthe [Court of Criminal Appeals] may sit . . . .\u201d 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7866(a). Because respondent\u2019s request for coram nobis is\nsimply a further \u201cstep in [his] criminal\u201d appeal, Morgan,\n346 U. S., at 505, n. 4, the NMCCA\u2019s jurisdiction to issue\nthe writ derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised to\nhear and determine the validity of the conviction on direct\nreview. As even the Government concedes, the textual\nauthority under the UCMJ to \u201c \u2018revie[w] court-martial\ncases\u2019 \u201d provided the NMCCA with jurisdiction to hear an\nappeal of respondent\u2019s judgment of conviction. See Brief\nfor United States 17\u201318. That jurisdiction is sufficient to\npermit the NMCCA to entertain respondent\u2019s petition for\ncoram nobis. See also Courts of Criminal Appeals Rule of\nPractice and Procedure 2(b) (recognizing NMCCA discre\ntionary authority to entertain petitions for extraordinary\nwrits).\n10                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    It is true that when exercising its jurisdiction under\n\u00a7866(a), the NMCCA \u201cmay act only with respect to the\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority.\u201d \u00a7866(c). That limitation does not bar respon\ndent\u2019s request for a writ of coram nobis. An alleged error\nin the original judgment predicated on ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel challenges the validity of a convic\ntion, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at 3, so respondent\u2019s\nSixth Amendment claim is \u201cwith respect to\u201d the special\ncourt-martial\u2019s \u201cfindings of guilty,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7866(c).\nPursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA has subject-matter\njurisdiction to hear respondent\u2019s request for extraordinary\nrelief.\n    Because the NMCCA had jurisdiction over respondent\u2019s\npetition for coram nobis, the CAAF had jurisdiction to\nentertain respondent\u2019s appeal from the NMCCA\u2019s judg\nment. When exercising its jurisdiction, the CAAF\u2019s au\nthority is confined \u201cto matters of law\u201d connected to \u201cthe\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority and as affirmed or set aside . . . by the Court of\nCriminal Appeals,\u201d \u00a7867(c), but these limitations pose no\nobstacle to respondent\u2019s requested review of the NMCCA\u2019s\ndecision. Respondent\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim presents\na \u201cmatte[r] of law\u201d \u201cwith respect to the [guilty] findings . . .\nas approved by the [special court-martial] and as affirmed\n. . . by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d Ibid. The CAAF\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction to review the NMCCA\u2019s\ndenial of respondent\u2019s petition challenging the validity of\nhis original conviction.\n                             C\n  The Government counters that Article 76 of the UCMJ,\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7876, \u201caffirmatively prohibit[s] the type of\ncollateral review sought by respondent.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 18. That is incorrect. The Government\u2019s argument\ncommits the error of \u201cconflating the jurisdictional question\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the merits\u201d of respondent\u2019s petition. Arthur Andersen\nLLP, ante, at 3. Article 76 states in relevant part:\n       \u201cThe appellate review of records of trial provided by\n    this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences\n    of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed\n    as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and\n    discharges carried into execution under sentences by\n    courts-martial following approval, review, or affirma\n    tion as required by this chapter, are final and conclu\n    sive. Orders publishing the proceedings of courts\n    martial and all action taken pursuant to those pro\n    ceedings are binding upon all departments, courts,\n    agencies, and officers of the United States . . . .\u201d 10\n    U. S. C. \u00a7876.\nArticle 76 codifies the common-law rule that respects the\nfinality of judgments. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420\nU. S. 738, 749 (1975). Just as the rules of finality did not\njurisdictionally bar the court in Morgan from examining\nits earlier judgment, neither does the principle of finality\nbar the NMCCA from doing so here.\n   The Government may ultimately be correct that the\nfacts of respondent\u2019s case are insufficient to set aside the\nfinal judgment that Article 76 makes binding. No doubt,\njudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside; and courts\nmust be cautious so that the extraordinary remedy of\ncoram nobis issues only in extreme cases. But the long\nrecognized authority of a court to protect the integrity of\nits earlier judgments impels the conclusion that the final\nity rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each and every\ncompeting consideration. Our holding allows military\ncourts to protect the integrity of their dispositions and\nprocesses by granting relief from final judgments in ex\ntraordinary cases when it is shown that there were fun\ndamental flaws in the proceedings leading to their issu\nance.     The Government remains free to argue that\n12               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondent\u2019s is a merely ordinary case that is not entitled\nto extraordinary relief. But respondent\u2019s entitlement to\nrelief is a merits question outside the scope of the jurisdic\ntional question presented.\n   The Government\u2019s contention that coram nobis permits\na court \u201cto correct its own errors, not . . . those of an infe\nrior court,\u201d Brief for United States 36, can be disposed of\non similar grounds. Just as respondent\u2019s request for\ncoram nobis does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction,\nthe Government\u2019s argument that the relief should not\nissue \u201cin light of the writ\u2019s traditional scope\u201d does not\nundermine it, ibid. (emphasis deleted). In sum, the Gov\nernment\u2019s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe NMCCA\u2019s jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected\nthe former argument. Only the latter one is before us.\n   We hold that Article I military courts have jurisdiction\nto entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations\nthat an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a\nfundamental respect. That conclusion is consistent with\nour holding that Article III courts have a like authority.\nMorgan, 346 U. S., at 508. The result we reach today is of\ncentral importance for military courts. The military jus\ntice system relies upon courts that must take all appropri\nate means, consistent with their statutory jurisdiction, to\nensure the neutrality and integrity of their judgments.\nUnder the premises and statutes we have relied upon\nhere, the jurisdiction and the responsibility of military\ncourts to reexamine judgments in rare cases where a\nfundamental flaw is alleged and other judicial processes\nfor correction are unavailable are consistent with the\npowers Congress has granted those courts under Article I\nand with the system Congress has designed.\n                       *     *    *\n  We do not prejudge the merits of respondent\u2019s petition.\nTo be sure, the writ of error coram nobis is an extraordi\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The relative strength of re\nspondent\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim, his delay in lodg\ning his petition, when he learned or should have learned of\nhis counsel\u2019s alleged deficiencies, and the effect of the rule\nof judgment finality expressed in Article 76 are all factors\nthe NMCCA can explore on remand. We hold only that\nthe military appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear\nrespondent\u2019s request for a writ of coram nobis. The judg\nment of the CAAF is affirmed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Ante, at 8. The military\ncourts here had original jurisdiction over Denedo\u2019s case.\nThose courts therefore have implicit \u201cextended\u201d jurisdic-\ntion to consider Denedo\u2019s coram nobis petition.\n   The flaw in this syllogism is at the first step: The only\narguable authority for the proposition that coram nobis\njurisdiction marches hand in hand with original jurisdic-\ntion is a footnote in United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502\n(1954), and that case concerned Article III courts. The\nmilitary courts are markedly different. They are Article I\ncourts whose jurisdiction is precisely limited at every turn.\nThose careful limits cannot be overridden by judicial\n\u201cextension\u201d of statutory jurisdiction, or the addition of a\n\u201cfurther step\u201d to the ones marked out by Congress. Ante,\nat 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   I agree with the majority that this Court has jurisdic-\ntion to review the decision below, but respectfully dissent\nfrom its holding that military courts have jurisdiction to\nissue writs of coram nobis.\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO \n\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J. \n\n\n                               I\n\n   \u201cTraditionally, military justice has been a rough form of\njustice emphasizing summary procedures, speedy convic\ntions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining\nobedience and fighting fitness in the ranks.\u201d Reid v. Cov\nert, 354 U. S. 1, 35\u201336 (1957) (plurality opinion). Courts\nmartial are composed of active service members who sit\nonly to hear the particular case before them. Once a\ncourt-martial reaches a judgment and imposes a sentence,\nit is dissolved, and its members return to their regular\nduties.\n   Prior to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\nmilitary courts of appeals did not exist. If a service mem\nber wanted to challenge a court-martial conviction, he\npursued a collateral attack in an Article III court. There,\nreview was limited to whether the conviction was void\n\u201cbecause of lack of jurisdiction or some other equally fun\ndamental defect,\u201d Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, 747 (1975); beyond that, Article III courts adhered to\n\u201cthe general rule that the acts of a court martial, within\nthe scope of its jurisdiction and duty, cannot be controlled\nor reviewed in the civil courts,\u201d Smith v. Whitney, 116\nU. S. 167, 177 (1886).\n   The UCMJ established a \u201ccomplete system of [military]\nreview,\u201d Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plu\nrality opinion), including direct review in what are now\nthe Courts of Criminal Appeals (CCAs) and the Court of\nAppeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). But in keeping\nwith the historical backdrop against which these courts\nwere created, Congress did not grant military courts of\nappeals \u201cbroad responsibility with respect to administra\ntion of military justice\u201d; on the contrary, their jurisdiction\nis \u201cnarrowly circumscribed\u201d by the governing statutes.\nClinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U. S. 529, 534, 535 (1999) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The CCAs provide direct, record-based review of court\nmartial judgments, but they may only review cases re\nferred by the judge advocate general, who in turn refers\nonly those cases in which specific sentences are imposed.\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7866(b), (c). When reviewing that subset of\ncourt-martial judgments, a CCA \u201cmay act only with re\nspect to the findings and sentence as approved by the\nconvening authority.\u201d \u00a7866(c). If a case is reviewed by the\nCCA, the CCA\u2019s decision may then be reviewed by the\nCAAF. \u00a7867(a). But that court, too, conducts limited\ndirect review: It \u201cmay act only with respect to the findings\nand sentence as approved by the convening authority and\nas affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the [CCA].\u201d\n\u00a7867(c). Once direct review in the CCA and the CAAF is\ncomplete, and review in this Court is exhausted or waived,\na judgment as to the legality of the court-martial proceed\nings is final, and the sentence imposed may be executed.\n\u00a7871(c)(1).\n   The UCMJ provides only one avenue for reconsideration\nof a final court-martial conviction: a petition for a new\ntrial under Article 73. See \u00a7873. An Article 73 petition\nmay be brought \u201cwithin two years after approval by the\nconvening authority of a court-martial sentence,\u201d meaning\nit may be brought before or after a conviction becomes\nfinal. Ibid. If direct review is still pending before a CCA\nor the CAAF when the petition is filed, the judge advocate\ngeneral (to whom the petition must be directed) will refer\nthe petition to that court. Ibid. But once the conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general may act on an Arti\ncle 73 petition. Ibid.\n   Article 76 \u201c \u2018describ[es] the terminal point for proceed\nings within the court-martial system.\u2019 \u201d Councilman,\nsupra, at 750 (quoting Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U.

Under that provision, final court-martial\njudgments are \u201cbinding upon all departments, courts,\nagencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to\n4                   UNITED STATES v.

See Gusik, supra,\nat 133\u2013134.1\n   Federal courts are authorized to issue extraordinary\nwrits such as coram nobis only as \u201cnecessary or appropri\nate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d 28 U.

The All Writs Act \u201cconfine[s] the power of the\nCAAF to issuing process \u2018in aid of\u2019 its existing statutory\njurisdiction\u201d and \u201cdoes not enlarge that jurisdiction.\u201d\nGoldsmith, supra, at 534\u2013535; see also Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969) (although military courts can\nissue extraordinary writs in aid of their direct review\njurisdiction, \u201c[a] different question would, of course, arise\nin a case which the [courts are] not authorized to review\nunder the governing statutes\u201d). The UCMJ grants mili\ntary courts of appeals no jurisdiction over final court\nmartial judgments, so there is no jurisdiction for a post\nconviction extraordinary writ to \u201caid.\u201d A petition for co\nram nobis by its nature seeks postconviction review; it is\ntherefore beyond the scope of these courts\u2019 \u201cnarrowly\ncircumscribed\u201d statutory jurisdiction.

The\nauthority the Court cites for this key jurisdictional analy\nsis is\u2014a footnote. See ante, at 8 (citing Morgan, 346 U. S.,\nat 505, n. 4); ante, at 9 (same). Now, footnotes are part of\nan opinion, too, even if not the most likely place to look for\na key jurisdictional ruling. But since footnote 4 plays such\nan indispensable role in the majority\u2019s analysis, it must be\nread with care.\n   The first thing you notice in doing so is that the footnote\ndoes not mention the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d at all. That is\nbecause it has nothing to do with jurisdiction. The issue\naddressed in the paragraph to which the footnote was\nappended was \u201cchoice of remedy.\u201d 346 U. S., at 505. The\nCourt concluded that coram nobis was the appropriate\none. The footnote simply addressed the concern that the\nremedy might not be available because the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure had abolished coram nobis as a remedy;\nthe concern was dismissed because the Court concluded\nthe criminal rules, not the civil rules, applied. Id., at 505,\nn. 4; see also United States v. Keogh, 391 F. 2d 138, 140\n(CA2 1968) (Friendly, J.) (\u201cThe problem to which the\nfootnote was addressed was that F. R. Civ. P. 60(b) had\nabolished writs of error coram nobis\u201d).\n   The point is further confirmed by the text in the body of\nthe opinion: The Court\u2019s conclusion in the paragraph in\nwhich the footnote appears is that since the remedy\nsought was \u201cin the nature of . . . coram nobis,\u201d the trial\ncourt could \u201cproperly exercise its jurisdiction.\u201d 346 U.

The\nmilitary courts are Article I courts. The distinction has\ndirect pertinence to the point at issue in this case.\n   Legal doctrines \u201cmust be placed in their historical set\nting. They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically\ntransplanted into an alien, unrelated context without\nsuffering mutilation or distortion.\u201d Reid, 354 U. S., at 50\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). The Article III\ncourts have been given broad jurisdiction. I can under\nstand, if not necessarily agree with, the notion that they\nmight enjoy some implicit \u201clong-recognized authority\u201d to\ncorrect their earlier judgments. See ante, at 11. But not\nso for Article I courts. The principle that Congress defines\nthe jurisdiction of the lower federal courts \u201capplies with\nadded force to Article I tribunals.\u201d Ante, at 7. That is\nespecially true with respect to military courts. The mili\ntary justice system is the last place courts should go about\nfinding \u201cextensions\u201d of jurisdiction beyond that conferred\nby statute.\n   As we expressly recognized in Goldsmith, \u201cthere is no\nsource of continuing jurisdiction for the CAAF over all\nactions administering sentences that the CAAF at one\ntime had the power to review.\u201d 526 U. S., at 536 (empha\nsis added). Since the UCMJ grants military courts no\npostconviction jurisdiction, conferring on them perpetual\nauthority to entertain coram nobis petitions plainly con\ntravenes that basic principle.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Once you get into the business of extending jurisdiction, it can be\n\nhard to stop.

Where a statute specifically\naddresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority,\nand not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u2019 \u201d Carlisle v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 416, 429 (1996) (quoting Pennsyl\nvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals\nService, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985)).\n   The UCMJ contains not one, but two provisions specifi\ncally limiting the circumstances under which postconvic\ntion relief (other than action by the appropriate Secretary\nor the President) may be obtained within the court-martial\nsystem. First, Article 73 provides that, \u201cwithin two years\nafter approval by the convening authority of a court\nmartial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge\nAdvocate General for a new trial on the grounds of newly\ndiscovered evidence or fraud on the court.\u201d 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7873. The only relief available under this \u201cspecial post\nconviction remedy\u201d is a new trial, Burns, 346 U. S., at 141\n(plurality opinion), and even that may be granted only in\nan expressly circumscribed timeframe (two years) and set\nof circumstances (newly discovered evidence or fraud on\nthe court). Article 73 stands in stark contrast to coram\nnobis, which the majority characterizes as a writ infinitely\navailable \u201cto redress a[ny] fundamental error.\u201d Ante, at 6;\nsee Morgan, supra, at 512 (\u201cfundamental error\u201d not lim\nited to jurisdictional defects or errors on the face of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndoes issue with respect to a former service member, the Government\nmaintains it would lack jurisdiction to retry. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56\u201357;\nsee 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7802\u2013803. Avoiding that extraordinary result would\nrequire another \u201cbelated extension\u201d of the original court-martial pro\nceeding, expanding the jurisdiction of military courts to try individuals\nwho have long since severed their ties to the military.\n8                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nrecord).\n   To be sure, the limited nature of relief available under\nArticle 73 might lead one to question whether that is truly\nthe only postconviction relief the UCMJ permits. \u201cYou\u2019re\nin the Army now\u201d is a sufficient answer to such concerns;\nthe relief available looks positively extravagant in light of\nthe prior history and tradition of military justice. In any\nevent, as the majority recognizes, see ante, at 11, Article\n76 makes clear that all court-martial judgments \u201ccarried\ninto execution\u201d after completion of direct review are \u201cfinal\nand conclusive,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7876. Contrary to the major\nity\u2019s assertion, that language does not simply \u201ccodif[y] the\ncommon-law rule that respects the finality of judgments.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. In fact, Article 76 does not stop there. It goes\non to instruct that final court-martial judgments are\nbinding \u201csubject only to action upon a petition for a new\ntrial [under Article 73],\u201d or action by the appropriate\nSecretary or the President. 10 U. S. C. \u00a7876 (emphasis\nadded).\n   In light of these provisions, only Article 73 provides any\nauthority to the CCAs or the CAAF, and even that narrow\nauthority is limited to pending cases. Once a conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general can provide relief.\nSee supra, at 3; 10 U. S. C. \u00a7873. To the extent the CCAs\nor the CAAF could be deemed to have some inherent\ncontinuing authority to issue writs of coram nobis, Articles\n73 and 76 extinguish it.\n                              IV\n  The Government goes on to argue that even if military\ncourts have jurisdiction to issue writs of coram nobis, and\neven if Articles 73 and 76 do not bar such relief, the courts\nstill lack authority to issue coram nobis, because the writ\nis neither \u201cnecessary\u201d nor \u201cappropriate\u201d to the court\nmartial system of justice. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a) (federal\ncourts \u201cmay issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Coram nobis allows the\ncourt that issued a judgment to correct its own errors of\nfact. See Morgan, 346 U.

Tidd, Practice of the Courts of\nKing\u2019s Bench, and Common Pleas 1136 (4th Am. ed. 1856);\nsome emphasis added)); see also ante, at 11 (referring to\n\u201cauthority of a court to protect the integrity of its earlier\njudgments\u201d (emphasis added)). But a court-martial is not\na standing court. On a case-by-case basis, \u201c[i]t is called\ninto existence for a special purpose and to perform a par\nticular duty. When the object of its creation has been\naccomplished it is dissolved.\u201d Runkle v. United States, 122\nU. S. 543, 555\u2013556 (1887); see also 66 M. J. 114, 124\n(CAAF 2008) (a court-martial \u201cdoes not have independent\njurisdiction over a case after the military judge authenti\ncates the record and the convening authority forwards the\nrecord after taking action\u201d). Because the court-martial\nthat issues the conviction no longer exists once the convic\ntion is final, there is no court to which a postconviction\npetition for coram nobis could be directed.\n   The absence of standing courts-martial is no mere tech\nnicality, but rather an integral and intentional part of the\nmilitary justice system. \u201cCourt-martial jurisdiction sprang\nfrom the belief that within the military ranks there is need\nfor a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience\nand order.\u201d United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S.\n11, 22 (1955). But meeting that need requires expending\nsignificant military resources, and \u201c[t]o the extent that\nthose responsible for performance of [the military\u2019s] pri\nmary function are diverted from it by the necessity of\ntrying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not\nserved.\u201d Id., at 17. Accordingly, courts-martial, composed\nof active duty military personnel, have always been called\ninto existence for a limited purpose and duration.\n10               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   It is no answer that the CCAs and the CAAF are stand\ning courts that could act as substitutes for coram nobis\npurposes. As this case illustrates, those courts are not\nequipped to handle the kind of factfinding necessary to\nresolve claims that might be brought on coram nobis.\nInstead, the CCAs will have to resort to the procedures\ninvented by United States v. DuBay, 17 U. S. C. M. A. 147,\n37 C. M. R. 411 (1967), under which a new convening\nauthority will refer a case to a new court-martial, and task\nvarious military personnel who have no prior familiarity\nwith the case to conduct an out-of-court evidentiary hear\ning on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim. Id., at 149, 37\nC. M. R., at 413. This \u201cunwieldy and imperfect system\u201d\nwill undoubtedly divert valuable military resources, 66\nM. J., at 136 (Ryan, J., dissenting), all in aid of postconvic\ntion relief Congress specifically withheld.\n   The Court expressly declines to consider the Govern\nment\u2019s \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d argument: \u201c[T]he Gov\nernment\u2019s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe [CCA\u2019s] jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected the\nformer argument. Only the latter one is before us.\u201d Ante,\nat 12. The Court may well be correct in dividing the ques\ntions into separate pigeonholes. But the Government\u2019s\nargument, even if an argument about authority rather\nthan jurisdiction, applies to every coram nobis case, given\nthe nature of the military justice system. It is curious to\nconclude that military courts have jurisdiction, while not\nconsidering a raised and briefed argument that they may\nnever exercise it.\n                       *     *     *\n   Since the adoption of the UCMJ, \u201cCongress has gradu\nally changed the system of military justice so that it has\ncome to more closely resemble the civilian system.\u201d Weiss\nv.

Neither the jurisdiction nor the powers of\nArticle III courts are necessarily appropriate for military\ncourts, and Congress\u2019s contrary determinations in this\narea are entitled to \u201cthe highest deference.\u201d Loving v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 748, 768 (1996). Rather than\nrespect the rule that military courts have no jurisdiction to\nrevisit final convictions, the majority creates an exception\nthat swallows it. Because I would hold the military courts\nto the statutory restraints that govern them, I respectfully\ndissent.\n",

Argued March 25, 2009\u2014Decided June 8, 2009\nMilitary authorities charged respondent, a native Nigerian serving in\n the U. S. Navy, with violating of the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n (UCMJ). With counsel\u2019s assistance, respondent agreed to plead\n guilty to reduced charges. The special court-martial accepted the\n plea and convicted and sentenced respondent; the Navy-Marine\n Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA) affirmed; and he was dis\n charged from the Navy in 2000. In 2006, the Department of Home\n land Security commenced removal proceedings against respondent\n based on the conviction. To avoid deportation, he filed a petition for a\n writ of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs Act, asking\n the NMCCA to vacate the conviction it had earlier affirmed on the\n ground that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of\n counsel, who had assured him his plea bargain carried no risk of de\n portation. Though rejecting the Government\u2019s contention that it\n lacked jurisdiction to grant the writ, the NMCCA denied relief for\n lack of merit. Agreeing that the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the Court\n of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) remanded for further pro\n ceedings on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U. S.

Though \u00a71259 does not define\n \u201crelief,\u201d the word\u2019s familiar meaning encompasses any redress or\n benefit provided by a court.

S. 502, 505 n. 4, the\n    NMCCA\u2019s jurisdiction to issue the writ derives from the earlier juris\n    diction it exercised under \u00a7866(a) to hear and determine the convic\n    tion\u2019s validity on direct review. Respondent\u2019s coram nobis request is\n    not barred by the requirement that the NMCCA \u201cact only with re\n    spect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening au\n    thority.\u201d \u00a7866(c).

Because the NMCCA has jurisdiction,\n    the CAAF has jurisdiction to review the NMCCA\u2019s denial of respon\n    dent\u2019s petition challenging the validity of his original conviction.\n    That the CAAF\u2019s authority is confined \u201cto matters of law\u201d connected\n    to \u201cthe findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority\n    and as affirmed or set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeals,\u201d\n    \u00a7867(c), poses no obstacle to respondent\u2019s requested review.

The military court which had affirmed the conviction\nand where the writ of coram nobis was sought is the Navy-\nMarine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA). Its\nruling that it had jurisdiction to grant the writ, but then\ndenying its issuance for lack of merit, was appealed to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\n(CAAF). After the CAAF agreed that the NMCCA has\njurisdiction to issue the writ, it remanded for further\nproceedings on the merits. The Government of the United\nStates, contending that a writ of coram nobis directed to a\nfinal judgment of conviction is beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe military courts, now brings the case to us.\n                            I\n  Respondent Jacob Denedo came to the United States in\n1984 from his native Nigeria. He enlisted in the Navy in\n1989 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1990. In\n1998, military authorities charged him with conspiracy,\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlarceny, and forgery\u2014in contravention of Articles 81, 121,\nand 123 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7881, 921, 923\u2014all for his role in a scheme to\ndefraud a community college. With the assistance of both\nmilitary and civilian counsel, respondent made a plea\nbargain to plead guilty to reduced charges. In exchange\nfor his plea the convening authority referred respondent\u2019s\ncase to a special court-martial, \u00a7819, which, at that time,\ncould not impose a sentence greater than six months\u2019\nconfinement.\n    The special court-martial, consisting of a single military\njudge, accepted respondent\u2019s guilty plea after determining\nthat it was both knowing and voluntary. The court con\nvicted respondent of conspiracy and larceny. It sentenced\nhim to three months\u2019 confinement, a bad-conduct dis\ncharge, and a reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade.\nRespondent appealed on the ground that his sentence was\nunduly severe. The NMCCA affirmed. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 64a\u201367a. Respondent did not seek further review in\nthe CAAF, and he was discharged from the Navy on May\n30, 2000.\n    In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security com\nmenced removal proceedings against respondent based\nupon his special court-martial conviction. To avoid depor\ntation, respondent decided to challenge his conviction once\nmore, though at this point it had been final for eight years.\nHe maintained, in a petition for a writ of coram nobis filed\nwith the NMCCA, that the conviction it had earlier af\nfirmed must be deemed void because his guilty plea was\nthe result of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Petitioner argued that the\nNMCCA could set aside its earlier decision by issuing a\nwrit of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs\nAct, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a).\n   The Government filed a motion to dismiss for want of\njurisdiction. It contended that the NMCCA had no author\nity to conduct postconviction proceedings. In a terse, four\nsentence order, the NMCCA summarily denied both the\nGovernment\u2019s motion and respondent\u2019s petition for a writ\nof coram nobis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a. Respondent\nappealed and the CAAF, dividing 3 to 2, affirmed in part\nand reversed in part. The CAAF agreed with the NMCCA\nthat standing military courts have jurisdiction to conduct\n\u201ccollateral review under the All Writs Act.\u201d 66 M. J., at\n119. This is so, the CAAF explained, because \u201cwhen a\npetitioner seeks collateral relief to modify an action that\nwas taken within the subject matter jurisdiction of the\nmilitary justice system . . . a writ that is necessary or\nappropriate may be issued under the All Writs Act \u2018in aid\nof\u2019 the court\u2019s existing jurisdiction.\u201d Id., at 120 (citing 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71651(a)).\n   Satisfied that it had jurisdiction, the CAAF next turned\nto whether the writ of coram nobis should issue. It held\nthat a nondefaulted, ineffective-assistance claim that was\nyet to receive a full and fair review \u201cwithin the military\njustice system\u201d could justify issuance of the writ. 66 M. J.,\nat 125. Finding that respondent\u2019s ineffective-assistance\nclaim satisfied \u201cthe threshold criteria for coram nobis\nreview,\u201d the CAAF remanded to the NMCCA so it could\nascertain in the first instance \u201cwhether the merits of\n[respondent\u2019s] petition can be resolved on the basis of the\nwritten submissions, or whether a factfinding hearing is\nrequired.\u201d Id., at 126, 130.\n4                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Judge Stucky filed a dissenting opinion. Assuming that\nthe majority had correctly determined its jurisdiction to\ngrant the requested relief, he concluded that respondent\u2019s\nineffective-assistance claim lacked merit. Id., at 131.\nJudge Ryan also dissented. Reasoning that the majority\nhad misapplied this Court\u2019s holding in Clinton v. Gold\nsmith, 526 U.

See Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, ante, at 6 (\u201cSubject-matter jurisdiction . . . should be\nconsidered when fairly in doubt\u201d). The Government, upon\nwhich the burden to demonstrate subject-matter jurisdic\ntion lies, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332,\n342 (2006), claims that our power to hear this appeal rests\non 28 U. S. C. \u00a71259(4). That jurisdictional provision\npermits us to review CAAF decisions in \u201c \u2018cases . . . in\nwhich the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces . . .\ngranted relief.\u2019 \u201d Respondent maintains that we lack\njurisdiction because the CAAF did not \u201c \u2018grant relief\u2019 \u201d; \u201call\nit did was remand\u201d to the NMCCA. Brief for Respondent\n6\u20137 (brackets omitted).\n   Respondent\u2019s parsimonious construction of the word\n\u201crelief\u201d need not detain us long. Though \u00a71259 does not\ndefine the term, its familiar meaning encompasses any\n\u201credress or benefit\u201d provided by a court. Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1317 (8th ed. 2004). The CAAF\u2019s judgment\nreversing the NMCCA satisfies that definition. The\nNMCCA denied respondent\u2019s petition for a writ of coram\nnobis, while the CAAF\u2019s decision reversed and remanded\nso that the NMCCA could determine anew if the writ\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nshould issue. That decision conferred a palpable benefit\non respondent; for a chance of success on the merits, how\never slight, is superior to no possibility at all.\n  To be sure, respondent would have preferred the CAAF\nto issue a writ of coram nobis or to direct the NMCCA to\ndo so rather than remanding for the NMCCA to conduct\nfurther proceedings. We have jurisdiction, however, to\nreview any decision granting \u201crelief,\u201d not just those provid\ning \u201cultimate relief\u201d or \u201ccomplete relief.\u201d Indeed, appellate\ncourts reverse and remand lower court judgments\u2014rather\nthan issuing complete relief\u2014with regularity. See, e.g.,\nArthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, ante, at ___; FCC v. Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., ante, at ___. There is no merit to\nthe view that a decision granting partial relief should be\nconstrued as granting no relief at all.\n  Because the CAAF \u201cgranted relief\u201d to respondent, the\ntext of \u00a71259 is satisfied here. We have jurisdiction to\ndetermine whether the CAAF was correct in ruling that\nthe NMCCA had authority to entertain the petition for a\nwrit of coram nobis.\n                             III\n                              A\n  The writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law\nremedy designed \u201cto correct errors of fact.\u201d United States\nv.

Tidd, Practice of\nCourts of King\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas *1136\u2013*1137).\nIn English practice the office of the writ was to foster\nrespect for judicial rulings by enabling the same court\n6               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cwhere the action was commenced and where the judg\nment was rendered\u201d to avoid the rigid strictures of judg\nment finality by correcting technical errors \u201csuch as hap\npened through the fault of the clerk in the record of the\nproceedings prior to the judgment.\u201d Plumer, supra, at\n572\u2013573.\n   Any rationale confining the writ to technical errors,\nhowever, has been superseded; for in its modern iteration\ncoram nobis is broader than its common-law predecessor.\nThis is confirmed by our opinion in Morgan. In that case\nwe found that a writ of coram nobis can issue to redress a\nfundamental error, there a deprivation of counsel in viola\ntion of the Sixth Amendment, as opposed to mere technical\nerrors. 346 U. S., at 513. The potential universe of cases\nthat range from technical errors to fundamental ones\nperhaps illustrates, in the case of coram nobis, the \u201cten\ndency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its\nlogic.\u201d B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 51\n(1921). To confine the use of coram nobis so that finality\nis not at risk in a great number of cases, we were careful\nin Morgan to limit the availability of the writ to \u201cextraor\ndinary\u201d cases presenting circumstances compelling its use\n\u201cto achieve justice.\u201d 346 U. S., at 511. Another limit, of\ncourse, is that an extraordinary remedy may not issue\nwhen alternative remedies, such as habeas corpus, are\navailable. See id., at 510\u2013511.\n   In federal courts the authority to grant a writ of coram\nnobis is conferred by the All Writs Act, which permits\n\u201ccourts established by Act of Congress\u201d to issue \u201call writs\nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic\ntions.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a). Though military courts, like\nArticle III tribunals, are empowered to issue extraordi\nnary writs under the All Writs Act, Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969), that authority does not deter\nmine the anterior question whether military courts have\njurisdiction to entertain a petition for coram nobis.

Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212 (2007) (\u201cWithin\nconstitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the\nfederal courts have jurisdiction to consider\u201d). This rule\napplies with added force to Article I tribunals, such as the\nNMCCA and CAAF, which owe their existence to Con\ngress\u2019 authority to enact legislation pursuant to Art. I, \u00a78\nof the Constitution. Goldsmith, 526 U. S., at 533\u2013534.\n   Our decision in Goldsmith demonstrates these teach\nings. There an Air Force officer, James Goldsmith, was\nconvicted of various crimes by general court-martial and\nsentenced to six years\u2019 confinement. Id., at 531. Follow\ning his conviction, Congress enacted a statute authorizing\nthe President to drop convicted officers from the rolls of\nthe Armed Forces. When the Air Force notified Goldsmith\nthat he would be dropped from the rolls, he lodged a peti\ntion before the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals\n(AFCCA) claiming that the proposed action contravened\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. Id., at 532\u2013\n533. Goldsmith sought extraordinary relief as authorized\nby the All Writs Act to enjoin the President from removing\nhim from the rolls. The AFCCA denied relief, but the\nCAAF granted it.\n   Concluding that the UCMJ does not authorize military\ncourts to review executive action\u2014including a decision to\ndrop an officer from the rolls\u2014we held that the AFCCA\nand the CAAF lacked jurisdiction over Goldsmith\u2019s case.\nId., at 535. This was so, we unequivocally found, irrespec\ntive of the military court\u2019s authority to issue extraordinary\nrelief pursuant to the All Writs Act and its previous juris\n8                 UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndiction over Goldsmith\u2019s criminal proceeding. The power\nto issue relief depends upon, rather than enlarges, a\ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction. Id., at 536\u2013537.\n   That principle does not control the question before us.\nBecause coram nobis is but an extraordinary tool to cor\nrect a legal or factual error, an application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired.\nSee Morgan, supra, at 505, n. 4 (coram nobis is \u201ca step in\nthe criminal case and not, like habeas corpus where relief\nis sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a\nseparate civil proceeding\u201d); see also United States v. Beg\ngerly, 524 U. S. 38, 46 (1998) (citing Pacific R. Co. of Mo. v.\nMissouri Pacific R. Co., 111 U. S. 505, 522 (1884) (noting\nthat an \u201cindependent action\u201d\u2014which, like coram nobis, is\nan equitable means to obtain relief from a judgment\u2014\n\u201c \u2018may be regarded as ancillary to the prior suit, so that the\nrelief asked may be granted by the court which made the\ndecree in that suit . . . . The bill, though an original bill in\nthe chancery sense of the word, is a continuation of the\nformer suit, on the question of the jurisdiction of the\n[court]\u2019 \u201d). It follows that to issue respondent a writ of\ncoram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must have had\nstatutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent\u2019s\noriginal judgment of conviction.\n                                B\n   In the critical part of its opinion discussing the jurisdic\ntion and authority of the NMCCA to issue a writ of coram\nnobis in an appropriate case, the CAAF describes respon\ndent\u2019s request for review as one \u201cunder the All Writs Act.\u201d\n66 M. J., at 119. This is correct, of course, if it simply\nconfirms that the Act authorizes federal courts to issue\nwrits \u201cin aid of\u201d their jurisdiction; but it does not advance\nthe inquiry into whether jurisdiction exists.\n   And there are limits to the use of coram nobis to alter or\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

As Goldsmith makes plain,\nthe All Writs Act and the extraordinary relief the statute\nauthorizes are not a source of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n526 U. S., at 534\u2013535. Statutes which address the power\nof a court to use certain writs or remedies or to decree\ncertain forms of relief, for instance to award damages in\nsome specified measure, in some circumstances might be\nconstrued also as a grant of jurisdiction to hear and de\ntermine the underlying cause of action. Cf. Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). We have long held, how\never, that the All Writs Act should not be interpreted in\nthis way. Goldsmith, supra, at 536; Plumer, 27 F. Cas., at\n574 (jurisdiction cannot be acquired \u201cby means of the writ\nto be issued\u201d). The authority to issue a writ under the All\nWrits Act is not a font of jurisdiction. See Syngenta Crop\nProtection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U. S. 28, 31 (2002).\n   Quite apart from the All Writs Act, we conclude that the\nNMCCA has jurisdiction to entertain respondent\u2019s request\nfor a writ of coram nobis. Article 66 of the UCMJ pro\nvides: \u201cFor the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases,\nthe [Court of Criminal Appeals] may sit . . . .\u201d 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7866(a). Because respondent\u2019s request for coram nobis is\nsimply a further \u201cstep in [his] criminal\u201d appeal, Morgan,\n346 U. S., at 505, n. 4, the NMCCA\u2019s jurisdiction to issue\nthe writ derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised to\nhear and determine the validity of the conviction on direct\nreview. As even the Government concedes, the textual\nauthority under the UCMJ to \u201c \u2018revie[w] court-martial\ncases\u2019 \u201d provided the NMCCA with jurisdiction to hear an\nappeal of respondent\u2019s judgment of conviction. See Brief\nfor United States 17\u201318. That jurisdiction is sufficient to\npermit the NMCCA to entertain respondent\u2019s petition for\ncoram nobis. See also Courts of Criminal Appeals Rule of\nPractice and Procedure 2(b) (recognizing NMCCA discre\ntionary authority to entertain petitions for extraordinary\nwrits).\n10                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    It is true that when exercising its jurisdiction under\n\u00a7866(a), the NMCCA \u201cmay act only with respect to the\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority.\u201d \u00a7866(c). That limitation does not bar respon\ndent\u2019s request for a writ of coram nobis. An alleged error\nin the original judgment predicated on ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel challenges the validity of a convic\ntion, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at 3, so respondent\u2019s\nSixth Amendment claim is \u201cwith respect to\u201d the special\ncourt-martial\u2019s \u201cfindings of guilty,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7866(c).\nPursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA has subject-matter\njurisdiction to hear respondent\u2019s request for extraordinary\nrelief.\n    Because the NMCCA had jurisdiction over respondent\u2019s\npetition for coram nobis, the CAAF had jurisdiction to\nentertain respondent\u2019s appeal from the NMCCA\u2019s judg\nment. When exercising its jurisdiction, the CAAF\u2019s au\nthority is confined \u201cto matters of law\u201d connected to \u201cthe\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority and as affirmed or set aside . . . by the Court of\nCriminal Appeals,\u201d \u00a7867(c), but these limitations pose no\nobstacle to respondent\u2019s requested review of the NMCCA\u2019s\ndecision. Respondent\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim presents\na \u201cmatte[r] of law\u201d \u201cwith respect to the [guilty] findings . . .\nas approved by the [special court-martial] and as affirmed\n. . . by the Court of Criminal Appeals.\u201d Ibid. The CAAF\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction to review the NMCCA\u2019s\ndenial of respondent\u2019s petition challenging the validity of\nhis original conviction.\n                             C\n  The Government counters that Article 76 of the UCMJ,\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7876, \u201caffirmatively prohibit[s] the type of\ncollateral review sought by respondent.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 18. That is incorrect. The Government\u2019s argument\ncommits the error of \u201cconflating the jurisdictional question\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Article 76 states in relevant part:\n       \u201cThe appellate review of records of trial provided by\n    this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences\n    of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed\n    as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and\n    discharges carried into execution under sentences by\n    courts-martial following approval, review, or affirma\n    tion as required by this chapter, are final and conclu\n    sive. Orders publishing the proceedings of courts\n    martial and all action taken pursuant to those pro\n    ceedings are binding upon all departments, courts,\n    agencies, and officers of the United States . . . .\u201d 10\n    U. S. C. \u00a7876.\nArticle 76 codifies the common-law rule that respects the\nfinality of judgments. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420\nU. S. 738, 749 (1975). Just as the rules of finality did not\njurisdictionally bar the court in Morgan from examining\nits earlier judgment, neither does the principle of finality\nbar the NMCCA from doing so here.\n   The Government may ultimately be correct that the\nfacts of respondent\u2019s case are insufficient to set aside the\nfinal judgment that Article 76 makes binding. No doubt,\njudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside; and courts\nmust be cautious so that the extraordinary remedy of\ncoram nobis issues only in extreme cases. But the long\nrecognized authority of a court to protect the integrity of\nits earlier judgments impels the conclusion that the final\nity rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each and every\ncompeting consideration. Our holding allows military\ncourts to protect the integrity of their dispositions and\nprocesses by granting relief from final judgments in ex\ntraordinary cases when it is shown that there were fun\ndamental flaws in the proceedings leading to their issu\nance.     The Government remains free to argue that\n12               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondent\u2019s is a merely ordinary case that is not entitled\nto extraordinary relief. But respondent\u2019s entitlement to\nrelief is a merits question outside the scope of the jurisdic\ntional question presented.\n   The Government\u2019s contention that coram nobis permits\na court \u201cto correct its own errors, not . . . those of an infe\nrior court,\u201d Brief for United States 36, can be disposed of\non similar grounds. Just as respondent\u2019s request for\ncoram nobis does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction,\nthe Government\u2019s argument that the relief should not\nissue \u201cin light of the writ\u2019s traditional scope\u201d does not\nundermine it, ibid. (emphasis deleted). In sum, the Gov\nernment\u2019s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe NMCCA\u2019s jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected\nthe former argument. Only the latter one is before us.\n   We hold that Article I military courts have jurisdiction\nto entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations\nthat an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a\nfundamental respect. That conclusion is consistent with\nour holding that Article III courts have a like authority.\nMorgan, 346 U. S., at 508. The result we reach today is of\ncentral importance for military courts. The military jus\ntice system relies upon courts that must take all appropri\nate means, consistent with their statutory jurisdiction, to\nensure the neutrality and integrity of their judgments.\nUnder the premises and statutes we have relied upon\nhere, the jurisdiction and the responsibility of military\ncourts to reexamine judgments in rare cases where a\nfundamental flaw is alleged and other judicial processes\nfor correction are unavailable are consistent with the\npowers Congress has granted those courts under Article I\nand with the system Congress has designed.\n                       *     *    *\n  We do not prejudge the merits of respondent\u2019s petition.\nTo be sure, the writ of error coram nobis is an extraordi\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

JACOB DENEDO\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE ARMED FORCES\n                        [June 8, 2009]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA,\nJUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO join, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part.\n   The Court\u2019s approach is simple: Jurisdiction to issue\nwrits of coram nobis is a \u201cbelated extension\u201d of a court\u2019s\noriginal, statutory jurisdiction. Ante, at 8. The military\ncourts here had original jurisdiction over Denedo\u2019s case.\nThose courts therefore have implicit \u201cextended\u201d jurisdic-\ntion to consider Denedo\u2019s coram nobis petition.\n   The flaw in this syllogism is at the first step: The only\narguable authority for the proposition that coram nobis\njurisdiction marches hand in hand with original jurisdic-\ntion is a footnote in United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502\n(1954), and that case concerned Article III courts. The\nmilitary courts are markedly different. They are Article I\ncourts whose jurisdiction is precisely limited at every turn.\nThose careful limits cannot be overridden by judicial\n\u201cextension\u201d of statutory jurisdiction, or the addition of a\n\u201cfurther step\u201d to the ones marked out by Congress. Ante,\nat 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   I agree with the majority that this Court has jurisdic-\ntion to review the decision below, but respectfully dissent\nfrom its holding that military courts have jurisdiction to\nissue writs of coram nobis.\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO \n\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J. \n\n\n                               I\n\n   \u201cTraditionally, military justice has been a rough form of\njustice emphasizing summary procedures, speedy convic\ntions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining\nobedience and fighting fitness in the ranks.\u201d Reid v. Cov\nert, 354 U. S. 1, 35\u201336 (1957) (plurality opinion). Courts\nmartial are composed of active service members who sit\nonly to hear the particular case before them. Once a\ncourt-martial reaches a judgment and imposes a sentence,\nit is dissolved, and its members return to their regular\nduties.\n   Prior to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\nmilitary courts of appeals did not exist. If a service mem\nber wanted to challenge a court-martial conviction, he\npursued a collateral attack in an Article III court. There,\nreview was limited to whether the conviction was void\n\u201cbecause of lack of jurisdiction or some other equally fun\ndamental defect,\u201d Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, 747 (1975); beyond that, Article III courts adhered to\n\u201cthe general rule that the acts of a court martial, within\nthe scope of its jurisdiction and duty, cannot be controlled\nor reviewed in the civil courts,\u201d Smith v. Whitney, 116\nU. S. 167, 177 (1886).\n   The UCMJ established a \u201ccomplete system of [military]\nreview,\u201d Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plu\nrality opinion), including direct review in what are now\nthe Courts of Criminal Appeals (CCAs) and the Court of\nAppeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). But in keeping\nwith the historical backdrop against which these courts\nwere created, Congress did not grant military courts of\nappeals \u201cbroad responsibility with respect to administra\ntion of military justice\u201d; on the contrary, their jurisdiction\nis \u201cnarrowly circumscribed\u201d by the governing statutes.\nClinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U. S. 529, 534, 535 (1999) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The CCAs provide direct, record-based review of court\nmartial judgments, but they may only review cases re\nferred by the judge advocate general, who in turn refers\nonly those cases in which specific sentences are imposed.\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7866(b), (c). When reviewing that subset of\ncourt-martial judgments, a CCA \u201cmay act only with re\nspect to the findings and sentence as approved by the\nconvening authority.\u201d \u00a7866(c). If a case is reviewed by the\nCCA, the CCA\u2019s decision may then be reviewed by the\nCAAF. \u00a7867(a). But that court, too, conducts limited\ndirect review: It \u201cmay act only with respect to the findings\nand sentence as approved by the convening authority and\nas affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the [CCA].\u201d\n\u00a7867(c). Once direct review in the CCA and the CAAF is\ncomplete, and review in this Court is exhausted or waived,\na judgment as to the legality of the court-martial proceed\nings is final, and the sentence imposed may be executed.\n\u00a7871(c)(1).\n   The UCMJ provides only one avenue for reconsideration\nof a final court-martial conviction: a petition for a new\ntrial under Article 73. See \u00a7873. An Article 73 petition\nmay be brought \u201cwithin two years after approval by the\nconvening authority of a court-martial sentence,\u201d meaning\nit may be brought before or after a conviction becomes\nfinal. Ibid. If direct review is still pending before a CCA\nor the CAAF when the petition is filed, the judge advocate\ngeneral (to whom the petition must be directed) will refer\nthe petition to that court. Ibid. But once the conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general may act on an Arti\ncle 73 petition. Ibid.\n   Article 76 \u201c \u2018describ[es] the terminal point for proceed\nings within the court-martial system.\u2019 \u201d Councilman,\nsupra, at 750 (quoting Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U. S. 128,\n132 (1950)). Under that provision, final court-martial\njudgments are \u201cbinding upon all departments, courts,\nagencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to\n4                   UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\naction upon a petition for a new trial [under Article 73],\u201d\nor to action by the appropriate Secretary or the President.\n10 U. S. C. \u00a7876 (emphasis added). Once an Article 73\npetition is denied, a service member has no relief left to\nseek within the court-martial system. See Gusik, supra,\nat 133\u2013134.1\n   Federal courts are authorized to issue extraordinary\nwrits such as coram nobis only as \u201cnecessary or appropri\nate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71651(a). The All Writs Act \u201cconfine[s] the power of the\nCAAF to issuing process \u2018in aid of\u2019 its existing statutory\njurisdiction\u201d and \u201cdoes not enlarge that jurisdiction.\u201d\nGoldsmith, supra, at 534\u2013535; see also Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969) (although military courts can\nissue extraordinary writs in aid of their direct review\njurisdiction, \u201c[a] different question would, of course, arise\nin a case which the [courts are] not authorized to review\nunder the governing statutes\u201d). The UCMJ grants mili\ntary courts of appeals no jurisdiction over final court\nmartial judgments, so there is no jurisdiction for a post\nconviction extraordinary writ to \u201caid.\u201d A petition for co\nram nobis by its nature seeks postconviction review; it is\ntherefore beyond the scope of these courts\u2019 \u201cnarrowly\ncircumscribed\u201d statutory jurisdiction. Goldsmith, supra,\nat 535.\n                            II\n  The majority overrides these careful limits on military\ncourt jurisdiction by maintaining that later jurisdiction to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 A court-martial conviction may still be collaterally attacked in an\n\nArticle III court, but that is because those courts possess jurisdiction\nbeyond that granted by the UCMJ. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72241, 1331.\nWe have repeatedly held that Article 76 \u201cdoes not expressly effect any\nchange in the subject-matter jurisdiction of Art. III courts.\u201d Schlesinger\nv. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 749 (1975). Our cases have never ques\ntioned that Article 76 limits the jurisdiction of military courts.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nissue coram nobis is a \u201cbelated extension\u201d of the statutory\njurisdiction, that \u201cjurisdiction to issue [coram nobis] de\nrives from the earlier jurisdiction.\u201d Ante, at 8, 9. The\nauthority the Court cites for this key jurisdictional analy\nsis is\u2014a footnote. See ante, at 8 (citing Morgan, 346 U. S.,\nat 505, n. 4); ante, at 9 (same). Now, footnotes are part of\nan opinion, too, even if not the most likely place to look for\na key jurisdictional ruling. But since footnote 4 plays such\nan indispensable role in the majority\u2019s analysis, it must be\nread with care.\n   The first thing you notice in doing so is that the footnote\ndoes not mention the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d at all. That is\nbecause it has nothing to do with jurisdiction. The issue\naddressed in the paragraph to which the footnote was\nappended was \u201cchoice of remedy.\u201d 346 U. S., at 505. The\nCourt concluded that coram nobis was the appropriate\none. The footnote simply addressed the concern that the\nremedy might not be available because the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure had abolished coram nobis as a remedy;\nthe concern was dismissed because the Court concluded\nthe criminal rules, not the civil rules, applied. Id., at 505,\nn. 4; see also United States v. Keogh, 391 F. 2d 138, 140\n(CA2 1968) (Friendly, J.) (\u201cThe problem to which the\nfootnote was addressed was that F. R. Civ. P. 60(b) had\nabolished writs of error coram nobis\u201d).\n   The point is further confirmed by the text in the body of\nthe opinion: The Court\u2019s conclusion in the paragraph in\nwhich the footnote appears is that since the remedy\nsought was \u201cin the nature of . . . coram nobis,\u201d the trial\ncourt could \u201cproperly exercise its jurisdiction.\u201d 346 U. S.,\nat 505 (emphasis added). The issue was not the existence\nof jurisdiction, but whether the court had the authority to\nexercise it. The Court in the present case recognizes the\ndistinction. See ante, at 10 (\u201cWhen exercising its jurisdic\ntion, the CAAF\u2019s authority is confined to matters of law\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); ante, at 9 (\u201cThe au\n6                   UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthority to issue a writ under the All Writs Act is not a font\nof jurisdiction\u201d).\n   Even accepting the majority\u2019s reading of Morgan\u2019s hith\nerto obscure footnote, that reading would only establish\nthe \u201cbelated jurisdiction\u201d theory for Article III courts. The\nmilitary courts are Article I courts. The distinction has\ndirect pertinence to the point at issue in this case.\n   Legal doctrines \u201cmust be placed in their historical set\nting. They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically\ntransplanted into an alien, unrelated context without\nsuffering mutilation or distortion.\u201d Reid, 354 U. S., at 50\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). The Article III\ncourts have been given broad jurisdiction. I can under\nstand, if not necessarily agree with, the notion that they\nmight enjoy some implicit \u201clong-recognized authority\u201d to\ncorrect their earlier judgments. See ante, at 11. But not\nso for Article I courts. The principle that Congress defines\nthe jurisdiction of the lower federal courts \u201capplies with\nadded force to Article I tribunals.\u201d Ante, at 7. That is\nespecially true with respect to military courts. The mili\ntary justice system is the last place courts should go about\nfinding \u201cextensions\u201d of jurisdiction beyond that conferred\nby statute.\n   As we expressly recognized in Goldsmith, \u201cthere is no\nsource of continuing jurisdiction for the CAAF over all\nactions administering sentences that the CAAF at one\ntime had the power to review.\u201d 526 U. S., at 536 (empha\nsis added). Since the UCMJ grants military courts no\npostconviction jurisdiction, conferring on them perpetual\nauthority to entertain coram nobis petitions plainly con\ntravenes that basic principle.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Once you get into the business of extending jurisdiction, it can be\n\nhard to stop. Denedo is no longer in the military. Ante, at 2. Military\ncourts lack jurisdiction over \u201ccivilian ex-soldiers who ha[ve] severed all\nrelationship with the military and its institutions.\u201d United States ex\nrel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14 (1955). In the event coram nobis\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009) \n                  7\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J. \n\n\n                             III \n\n   Even if the majority\u2019s reading of Morgan\u2019s footnote could\nbe transplanted to the military context, the majority\u2019s\nconclusion would still not follow. \u201c \u2018[T]he All Writs Act is a\nresidual source of authority to issue writs that are not\notherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically\naddresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority,\nand not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u2019 \u201d Carlisle v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 416, 429 (1996) (quoting Pennsyl\nvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals\nService, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985)).\n   The UCMJ contains not one, but two provisions specifi\ncally limiting the circumstances under which postconvic\ntion relief (other than action by the appropriate Secretary\nor the President) may be obtained within the court-martial\nsystem. First, Article 73 provides that, \u201cwithin two years\nafter approval by the convening authority of a court\nmartial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge\nAdvocate General for a new trial on the grounds of newly\ndiscovered evidence or fraud on the court.\u201d 10 U. S. C.\n\u00a7873. The only relief available under this \u201cspecial post\nconviction remedy\u201d is a new trial, Burns, 346 U. S., at 141\n(plurality opinion), and even that may be granted only in\nan expressly circumscribed timeframe (two years) and set\nof circumstances (newly discovered evidence or fraud on\nthe court). Article 73 stands in stark contrast to coram\nnobis, which the majority characterizes as a writ infinitely\navailable \u201cto redress a[ny] fundamental error.\u201d Ante, at 6;\nsee Morgan, supra, at 512 (\u201cfundamental error\u201d not lim\nited to jurisdictional defects or errors on the face of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndoes issue with respect to a former service member, the Government\nmaintains it would lack jurisdiction to retry. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56\u201357;\nsee 10 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7802\u2013803. Avoiding that extraordinary result would\nrequire another \u201cbelated extension\u201d of the original court-martial pro\nceeding, expanding the jurisdiction of military courts to try individuals\nwho have long since severed their ties to the military.\n8                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nrecord).\n   To be sure, the limited nature of relief available under\nArticle 73 might lead one to question whether that is truly\nthe only postconviction relief the UCMJ permits. \u201cYou\u2019re\nin the Army now\u201d is a sufficient answer to such concerns;\nthe relief available looks positively extravagant in light of\nthe prior history and tradition of military justice. In any\nevent, as the majority recognizes, see ante, at 11, Article\n76 makes clear that all court-martial judgments \u201ccarried\ninto execution\u201d after completion of direct review are \u201cfinal\nand conclusive,\u201d 10 U. S. C. \u00a7876. Contrary to the major\nity\u2019s assertion, that language does not simply \u201ccodif[y] the\ncommon-law rule that respects the finality of judgments.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. In fact, Article 76 does not stop there. It goes\non to instruct that final court-martial judgments are\nbinding \u201csubject only to action upon a petition for a new\ntrial [under Article 73],\u201d or action by the appropriate\nSecretary or the President. 10 U. S. C. \u00a7876 (emphasis\nadded).\n   In light of these provisions, only Article 73 provides any\nauthority to the CCAs or the CAAF, and even that narrow\nauthority is limited to pending cases. Once a conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general can provide relief.\nSee supra, at 3; 10 U. S. C. \u00a7873. To the extent the CCAs\nor the CAAF could be deemed to have some inherent\ncontinuing authority to issue writs of coram nobis, Articles\n73 and 76 extinguish it.\n                              IV\n  The Government goes on to argue that even if military\ncourts have jurisdiction to issue writs of coram nobis, and\neven if Articles 73 and 76 do not bar such relief, the courts\nstill lack authority to issue coram nobis, because the writ\nis neither \u201cnecessary\u201d nor \u201cappropriate\u201d to the court\nmartial system of justice. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a) (federal\ncourts \u201cmay issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof their respective jurisdictions\u201d). Coram nobis allows the\ncourt that issued a judgment to correct its own errors of\nfact. See Morgan, 346 U. S., at 507, n. 9 (\u201c \u2018If a judgment\nin the King\u2019s Bench be erroneous in matter of fact only, . . .\nit may be reversed in the same court, by writ of error\ncoram nobis\u2019 \u201d (quoting 2 W. Tidd, Practice of the Courts of\nKing\u2019s Bench, and Common Pleas 1136 (4th Am. ed. 1856);\nsome emphasis added)); see also ante, at 11 (referring to\n\u201cauthority of a court to protect the integrity of its earlier\njudgments\u201d (emphasis added)). But a court-martial is not\na standing court. On a case-by-case basis, \u201c[i]t is called\ninto existence for a special purpose and to perform a par\nticular duty. When the object of its creation has been\naccomplished it is dissolved.\u201d Runkle v. United States, 122\nU. S. 543, 555\u2013556 (1887); see also 66 M. J. 114, 124\n(CAAF 2008) (a court-martial \u201cdoes not have independent\njurisdiction over a case after the military judge authenti\ncates the record and the convening authority forwards the\nrecord after taking action\u201d). Because the court-martial\nthat issues the conviction no longer exists once the convic\ntion is final, there is no court to which a postconviction\npetition for coram nobis could be directed.\n   The absence of standing courts-martial is no mere tech\nnicality, but rather an integral and intentional part of the\nmilitary justice system. \u201cCourt-martial jurisdiction sprang\nfrom the belief that within the military ranks there is need\nfor a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience\nand order.\u201d United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S.\n11, 22 (1955). But meeting that need requires expending\nsignificant military resources, and \u201c[t]o the extent that\nthose responsible for performance of [the military\u2019s] pri\nmary function are diverted from it by the necessity of\ntrying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not\nserved.\u201d Id., at 17. Accordingly, courts-martial, composed\nof active duty military personnel, have always been called\ninto existence for a limited purpose and duration.\n10               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   It is no answer that the CCAs and the CAAF are stand\ning courts that could act as substitutes for coram nobis\npurposes. As this case illustrates, those courts are not\nequipped to handle the kind of factfinding necessary to\nresolve claims that might be brought on coram nobis.\nInstead, the CCAs will have to resort to the procedures\ninvented by United States v. DuBay, 17 U. S. C. M. A. 147,\n37 C. M. R. 411 (1967), under which a new convening\nauthority will refer a case to a new court-martial, and task\nvarious military personnel who have no prior familiarity\nwith the case to conduct an out-of-court evidentiary hear\ning on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim. Id., at 149, 37\nC. M. R., at 413. This \u201cunwieldy and imperfect system\u201d\nwill undoubtedly divert valuable military resources, 66\nM. J., at 136 (Ryan, J., dissenting), all in aid of postconvic\ntion relief Congress specifically withheld.\n   The Court expressly declines to consider the Govern\nment\u2019s \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d argument: \u201c[T]he Gov\nernment\u2019s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe [CCA\u2019s] jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected the\nformer argument. Only the latter one is before us.\u201d Ante,\nat 12. The Court may well be correct in dividing the ques\ntions into separate pigeonholes. But the Government\u2019s\nargument, even if an argument about authority rather\nthan jurisdiction, applies to every coram nobis case, given\nthe nature of the military justice system. It is curious to\nconclude that military courts have jurisdiction, while not\nconsidering a raised and briefed argument that they may\nnever exercise it.\n                       *     *     *\n   Since the adoption of the UCMJ, \u201cCongress has gradu\nally changed the system of military justice so that it has\ncome to more closely resemble the civilian system.\u201d Weiss\nv. United States, 510 U. S. 163, 174 (1994). \u201cBut the mili\ntary in important respects remains a specialized society\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Neither the jurisdiction nor the powers of\nArticle III courts are necessarily appropriate for military\ncourts, and Congress\u2019s contrary determinations in this\narea are entitled to \u201cthe highest deference.\u201d Loving v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 748, 768 (1996). Rather than\nrespect the rule that military courts have no jurisdiction to\nrevisit final convictions, the majority creates an exception\nthat swallows it. Because I would hold the military courts\nto the statutory restraints that govern them, I respectfully\ndissent.\n</pre>",
