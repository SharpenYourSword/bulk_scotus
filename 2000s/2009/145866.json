Argued March 25, 2009—Decided June 8, 2009\nMilitary authorities charged respondent, a native Nigerian serving in\n the U. S. Navy, with violating of the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n (UCMJ). With counsel’s assistance, respondent agreed to plead\n guilty to reduced charges. The special court-martial accepted the\n plea and convicted and sentenced respondent; the Navy-Marine\n Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA) affirmed; and he was dis\n charged from the Navy in 2000. In 2006, the Department of Home\n land Security commenced removal proceedings against respondent\n based on the conviction. To avoid deportation, he filed a petition for a\n writ of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs Act, asking\n the NMCCA to vacate the conviction it had earlier affirmed on the\n ground that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of\n counsel, who had assured him his plea bargain carried no risk of de\n portation. Though rejecting the Government’s contention that it\n lacked jurisdiction to grant the writ, the NMCCA denied relief for\n lack of merit. Agreeing that the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the Court\n of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) remanded for further pro\n ceedings on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n §1259(4), which permits it to review CAAF decisions in cases “in\n which [that court] granted relief.” Respondent’s parsimonious view\n that the CAAF did not “ ‘gran[t] relief’ ” in this case, but simply re\n manded to the NMCCA, is rejected. Though §1259 does not define\n “relief,” the word’s familiar meaning encompasses any redress or\n benefit provided by a court. The CAAF’s judgment reversing the\n NMCCA satisfies that definition.

S. 683, 695, n. 7, does not de\n    termine the anterior question whether those courts have jurisdiction\n    to entertain a coram nobis petition. As recognized by the All Writs\n    Act—which permits “courts established by Act of Congress” to issue\n    “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic\n    tions,” 28 U. S. C. §1651(a)—a court’s power to issue any form of re\n    lief, extraordinary or otherwise, is contingent on its subject-matter\n    jurisdiction over the case or controversy. Such jurisdiction is deter\n    mined by Congress. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212. Thus, to\n    issue respondent a writ of coram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must\n    have had statutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent’s\n    original judgment of conviction. Pp. 5–8.\n          (b) Pursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA and the CAAF have sub\n    ject-matter jurisdiction over this case. The NMCCA has jurisdiction\n    to entertain respondent’s coram nobis request under UCMJ Article\n    66, which provides: “For the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases,\n    the [NMCCA] may sit . . . .” 10 U. S. C. §866(a). Because respon\n    dent’s coram nobis request is simply a further “step in [his] criminal”\n    appeal, United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 505 n. 4, the\n    NMCCA’s jurisdiction to issue the writ derives from the earlier juris\n    diction it exercised under §866(a) to hear and determine the convic\n    tion’s validity on direct review. Respondent’s coram nobis request is\n    not barred by the requirement that the NMCCA “act only with re\n    spect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening au\n    thority.” §866(c). An alleged error in the original judgment predi\n    cated on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenges the conviction’s\n    validity, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at ___, so respondent’s\n    Sixth Amendment claim is “with respect to” the special-court\n    martial’s “findings” of guilty. Because the NMCCA has jurisdiction,\n    the CAAF has jurisdiction to review the NMCCA’s denial of respon\n    dent’s petition challenging the validity of his original conviction.\n    That the CAAF’s authority is confined “to matters of law” connected\n    to “the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority\n    and as affirmed or set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeals,”\n    §867(c), poses no obstacle to respondent’s requested review. His\n    Sixth Amendment claim presents a “matte[r] of law” “with respect to\n    the [guilty] findings . . . as approved by the [special court-martial]\n    and as affirmed . . . by” the NMCCA. Pp. 8–10.\n          (c) The Government’s argument that UCMJ Article 76 affirma\n    tively prohibits the type of collateral review respondent seeks errs in\n    “conflating the jurisdictional question with the merits” of respon\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

JACOB DENEDO\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE ARMED FORCES\n\n                                 [June 8, 2009]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The case before us presents a single issue: whether an\nArticle I military appellate court has jurisdiction to enter\ntain a petition for a writ of error coram nobis to challenge\nits earlier, and final, decision affirming a criminal convic\ntion. The military court which had affirmed the conviction\nand where the writ of coram nobis was sought is the Navy-\nMarine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA). Its\nruling that it had jurisdiction to grant the writ, but then\ndenying its issuance for lack of merit, was appealed to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\n(CAAF). After the CAAF agreed that the NMCCA has\njurisdiction to issue the writ, it remanded for further\nproceedings on the merits. The Government of the United\nStates, contending that a writ of coram nobis directed to a\nfinal judgment of conviction is beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe military courts, now brings the case to us.\n                            I\n  Respondent Jacob Denedo came to the United States in\n1984 from his native Nigeria. He enlisted in the Navy in\n1989 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1990. In\n1998, military authorities charged him with conspiracy,\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlarceny, and forgery—in contravention of Articles 81, 121,\nand 123 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\n10 U. S. C. §§881, 921, 923—all for his role in a scheme to\ndefraud a community college. With the assistance of both\nmilitary and civilian counsel, respondent made a plea\nbargain to plead guilty to reduced charges. In exchange\nfor his plea the convening authority referred respondent’s\ncase to a special court-martial, §819, which, at that time,\ncould not impose a sentence greater than six months’\nconfinement.\n    The special court-martial, consisting of a single military\njudge, accepted respondent’s guilty plea after determining\nthat it was both knowing and voluntary. The court con\nvicted respondent of conspiracy and larceny. It sentenced\nhim to three months’ confinement, a bad-conduct dis\ncharge, and a reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade.\nRespondent appealed on the ground that his sentence was\nunduly severe. The NMCCA affirmed. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 64a–67a. Respondent did not seek further review in\nthe CAAF, and he was discharged from the Navy on May\n30, 2000.\n    In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security com\nmenced removal proceedings against respondent based\nupon his special court-martial conviction. To avoid depor\ntation, respondent decided to challenge his conviction once\nmore, though at this point it had been final for eight years.\nHe maintained, in a petition for a writ of coram nobis filed\nwith the NMCCA, that the conviction it had earlier af\nfirmed must be deemed void because his guilty plea was\nthe result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Respondent\nalleged that he informed his civilian attorney during plea\nnegotiations that “ ‘his primary concern and objective’ ”\nwas to avoid deportation and that he was willing to “ ‘risk\n. . . going to jail’ ” to avert separation from his family. 66\nM. J. 114, 118 (C. A. Armed Forces 2008). On respon\ndent’s account, his attorney—an alcoholic who was not\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsober during the course of the special court-martial pro\nceeding—erroneously assured him that “ ‘if he agreed to\nplead guilty at a special-court-martial he would avoid any\nrisk of deportation.’ ” Ibid. Petitioner argued that the\nNMCCA could set aside its earlier decision by issuing a\nwrit of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs\nAct, 28 U. S. C. §1651(a).\n   The Government filed a motion to dismiss for want of\njurisdiction. It contended that the NMCCA had no author\nity to conduct postconviction proceedings. In a terse, four\nsentence order, the NMCCA summarily denied both the\nGovernment’s motion and respondent’s petition for a writ\nof coram nobis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a. Respondent\nappealed and the CAAF, dividing 3 to 2, affirmed in part\nand reversed in part. The CAAF agreed with the NMCCA\nthat standing military courts have jurisdiction to conduct\n“collateral review under the All Writs Act.” 66 M. J., at\n119. This is so, the CAAF explained, because “when a\npetitioner seeks collateral relief to modify an action that\nwas taken within the subject matter jurisdiction of the\nmilitary justice system . . . a writ that is necessary or\nappropriate may be issued under the All Writs Act ‘in aid\nof’ the court’s existing jurisdiction.” Id., at 120 (citing 28\nU. S. C. §1651(a)).\n   Satisfied that it had jurisdiction, the CAAF next turned\nto whether the writ of coram nobis should issue. It held\nthat a nondefaulted, ineffective-assistance claim that was\nyet to receive a full and fair review “within the military\njustice system” could justify issuance of the writ. 66 M. J.,\nat 125. Finding that respondent’s ineffective-assistance\nclaim satisfied “the threshold criteria for coram nobis\nreview,” the CAAF remanded to the NMCCA so it could\nascertain in the first instance “whether the merits of\n[respondent’s] petition can be resolved on the basis of the\nwritten submissions, or whether a factfinding hearing is\nrequired.” Id., at 126, 130.\n4                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Judge Stucky filed a dissenting opinion. Assuming that\nthe majority had correctly determined its jurisdiction to\ngrant the requested relief, he concluded that respondent’s\nineffective-assistance claim lacked merit. Id., at 131.\nJudge Ryan also dissented. Reasoning that the majority\nhad misapplied this Court’s holding in Clinton v. Gold\nsmith, 526 U. S. 529 (1999), she concluded that the UCMJ\ndoes not confer jurisdiction upon military tribunals to\nconduct “post-finality collateral review.” 66 M. J., at 136.\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\naffirm.\n                             II\n   Before we address another court’s subject-matter juris\ndiction we must first determine our own. See Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, ante, at 6 (“Subject-matter jurisdiction . . . should be\nconsidered when fairly in doubt”). The Government, upon\nwhich the burden to demonstrate subject-matter jurisdic\ntion lies, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332,\n342 (2006), claims that our power to hear this appeal rests\non 28 U. S. C. §1259(4). That jurisdictional provision\npermits us to review CAAF decisions in “ ‘cases . . . in\nwhich the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces . . .\ngranted relief.’ ” Respondent maintains that we lack\njurisdiction because the CAAF did not “ ‘grant relief’ ”; “all\nit did was remand” to the NMCCA. Brief for Respondent\n6–7 (brackets omitted).\n   Respondent’s parsimonious construction of the word\n“relief” need not detain us long. Though §1259 does not\ndefine the term, its familiar meaning encompasses any\n“redress or benefit” provided by a court. Black’s Law\nDictionary 1317 (8th ed. 2004). The CAAF’s judgment\nreversing the NMCCA satisfies that definition. The\nNMCCA denied respondent’s petition for a writ of coram\nnobis, while the CAAF’s decision reversed and remanded\nso that the NMCCA could determine anew if the writ\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nshould issue. That decision conferred a palpable benefit\non respondent; for a chance of success on the merits, how\never slight, is superior to no possibility at all.\n  To be sure, respondent would have preferred the CAAF\nto issue a writ of coram nobis or to direct the NMCCA to\ndo so rather than remanding for the NMCCA to conduct\nfurther proceedings. We have jurisdiction, however, to\nreview any decision granting “relief,” not just those provid\ning “ultimate relief” or “complete relief.” Indeed, appellate\ncourts reverse and remand lower court judgments—rather\nthan issuing complete relief—with regularity. See, e.g.,\nArthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, ante, at ___; FCC v. Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., ante, at ___. There is no merit to\nthe view that a decision granting partial relief should be\nconstrued as granting no relief at all.\n  Because the CAAF “granted relief” to respondent, the\ntext of §1259 is satisfied here. We have jurisdiction to\ndetermine whether the CAAF was correct in ruling that\nthe NMCCA had authority to entertain the petition for a\nwrit of coram nobis.\n                             III\n                              A\n  The writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law\nremedy designed “to correct errors of fact.” United States\nv. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 507 (1954). In American juris\nprudence the precise contours of coram nobis have not\nbeen “well defined,” Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410,\n416 (1882), but the writ traces its origins to the King’s\nBench and the Court of Common Pleas. United States v.\nPlumer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573 (No. 16,056) (CC Mass. 1859)\n(opinion for the court by Clifford, Circuit Justice); see also\nMorgan, supra, at 507, n. 9 (citing 2 W. Tidd, Practice of\nCourts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas *1136–*1137).\nIn English practice the office of the writ was to foster\nrespect for judicial rulings by enabling the same court\n6               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“where the action was commenced and where the judg\nment was rendered” to avoid the rigid strictures of judg\nment finality by correcting technical errors “such as hap\npened through the fault of the clerk in the record of the\nproceedings prior to the judgment.” Plumer, supra, at\n572–573.\n   Any rationale confining the writ to technical errors,\nhowever, has been superseded; for in its modern iteration\ncoram nobis is broader than its common-law predecessor.\nThis is confirmed by our opinion in Morgan. In that case\nwe found that a writ of coram nobis can issue to redress a\nfundamental error, there a deprivation of counsel in viola\ntion of the Sixth Amendment, as opposed to mere technical\nerrors. 346 U. S., at 513. The potential universe of cases\nthat range from technical errors to fundamental ones\nperhaps illustrates, in the case of coram nobis, the “ten\ndency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its\nlogic.” B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 51\n(1921). To confine the use of coram nobis so that finality\nis not at risk in a great number of cases, we were careful\nin Morgan to limit the availability of the writ to “extraor\ndinary” cases presenting circumstances compelling its use\n“to achieve justice.” 346 U. S., at 511. Another limit, of\ncourse, is that an extraordinary remedy may not issue\nwhen alternative remedies, such as habeas corpus, are\navailable. See id., at 510–511.\n   In federal courts the authority to grant a writ of coram\nnobis is conferred by the All Writs Act, which permits\n“courts established by Act of Congress” to issue “all writs\nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic\ntions.” 28 U. S. C. §1651(a). Though military courts, like\nArticle III tribunals, are empowered to issue extraordi\nnary writs under the All Writs Act, Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969), that authority does not deter\nmine the anterior question whether military courts have\njurisdiction to entertain a petition for coram nobis.

S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntext of the All Writs Act recognizes, a court’s power to\nissue any form of relief—extraordinary or otherwise—is\ncontingent on that court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe case or controversy.\n   Assuming no constraints or limitations grounded in the\nConstitution are implicated, it is for Congress to deter\nmine the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal courts.\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212 (2007) (“Within\nconstitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the\nfederal courts have jurisdiction to consider”). This rule\napplies with added force to Article I tribunals, such as the\nNMCCA and CAAF, which owe their existence to Con\ngress’ authority to enact legislation pursuant to Art. I, §8\nof the Constitution. Goldsmith, 526 U. S., at 533–534.\n   Our decision in Goldsmith demonstrates these teach\nings. There an Air Force officer, James Goldsmith, was\nconvicted of various crimes by general court-martial and\nsentenced to six years’ confinement. Id., at 531. Follow\ning his conviction, Congress enacted a statute authorizing\nthe President to drop convicted officers from the rolls of\nthe Armed Forces. When the Air Force notified Goldsmith\nthat he would be dropped from the rolls, he lodged a peti\ntion before the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals\n(AFCCA) claiming that the proposed action contravened\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. Id., at 532–\n533. Goldsmith sought extraordinary relief as authorized\nby the All Writs Act to enjoin the President from removing\nhim from the rolls. The AFCCA denied relief, but the\nCAAF granted it.\n   Concluding that the UCMJ does not authorize military\ncourts to review executive action—including a decision to\ndrop an officer from the rolls—we held that the AFCCA\nand the CAAF lacked jurisdiction over Goldsmith’s case.\nId., at 535. This was so, we unequivocally found, irrespec\ntive of the military court’s authority to issue extraordinary\nrelief pursuant to the All Writs Act and its previous juris\n8                 UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndiction over Goldsmith’s criminal proceeding. The power\nto issue relief depends upon, rather than enlarges, a\ncourt’s jurisdiction. Id., at 536–537.\n   That principle does not control the question before us.\nBecause coram nobis is but an extraordinary tool to cor\nrect a legal or factual error, an application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired.\nSee Morgan, supra, at 505, n. 4 (coram nobis is “a step in\nthe criminal case and not, like habeas corpus where relief\nis sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a\nseparate civil proceeding”); see also United States v. Beg\ngerly, 524 U. S. 38, 46 (1998) (citing Pacific R. Co. of Mo. v.\nMissouri Pacific R. Co., 111 U. S. 505, 522 (1884) (noting\nthat an “independent action”—which, like coram nobis, is\nan equitable means to obtain relief from a judgment—\n“ ‘may be regarded as ancillary to the prior suit, so that the\nrelief asked may be granted by the court which made the\ndecree in that suit . . . . The bill, though an original bill in\nthe chancery sense of the word, is a continuation of the\nformer suit, on the question of the jurisdiction of the\n[court]’ ”). It follows that to issue respondent a writ of\ncoram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must have had\nstatutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent’s\noriginal judgment of conviction.\n                                B\n   In the critical part of its opinion discussing the jurisdic\ntion and authority of the NMCCA to issue a writ of coram\nnobis in an appropriate case, the CAAF describes respon\ndent’s request for review as one “under the All Writs Act.”\n66 M. J., at 119. This is correct, of course, if it simply\nconfirms that the Act authorizes federal courts to issue\nwrits “in aid of” their jurisdiction; but it does not advance\nthe inquiry into whether jurisdiction exists.\n   And there are limits to the use of coram nobis to alter or\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

As Goldsmith makes plain,\nthe All Writs Act and the extraordinary relief the statute\nauthorizes are not a source of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n526 U. S., at 534–535. Statutes which address the power\nof a court to use certain writs or remedies or to decree\ncertain forms of relief, for instance to award damages in\nsome specified measure, in some circumstances might be\nconstrued also as a grant of jurisdiction to hear and de\ntermine the underlying cause of action. Cf. Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). We have long held, how\never, that the All Writs Act should not be interpreted in\nthis way. Goldsmith, supra, at 536; Plumer, 27 F. Cas., at\n574 (jurisdiction cannot be acquired “by means of the writ\nto be issued”). The authority to issue a writ under the All\nWrits Act is not a font of jurisdiction. See Syngenta Crop\nProtection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U. S. 28, 31 (2002).\n   Quite apart from the All Writs Act, we conclude that the\nNMCCA has jurisdiction to entertain respondent’s request\nfor a writ of coram nobis. Article 66 of the UCMJ pro\nvides: “For the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases,\nthe [Court of Criminal Appeals] may sit . . . .” 10 U. S. C.\n§866(a). Because respondent’s request for coram nobis is\nsimply a further “step in [his] criminal” appeal, Morgan,\n346 U. S., at 505, n. 4, the NMCCA’s jurisdiction to issue\nthe writ derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised to\nhear and determine the validity of the conviction on direct\nreview. As even the Government concedes, the textual\nauthority under the UCMJ to “ ‘revie[w] court-martial\ncases’ ” provided the NMCCA with jurisdiction to hear an\nappeal of respondent’s judgment of conviction. See Brief\nfor United States 17–18. That jurisdiction is sufficient to\npermit the NMCCA to entertain respondent’s petition for\ncoram nobis. See also Courts of Criminal Appeals Rule of\nPractice and Procedure 2(b) (recognizing NMCCA discre\ntionary authority to entertain petitions for extraordinary\nwrits).\n10                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    It is true that when exercising its jurisdiction under\n§866(a), the NMCCA “may act only with respect to the\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority.” §866(c). That limitation does not bar respon\ndent’s request for a writ of coram nobis. An alleged error\nin the original judgment predicated on ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel challenges the validity of a convic\ntion, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at 3, so respondent’s\nSixth Amendment claim is “with respect to” the special\ncourt-martial’s “findings of guilty,” 10 U. S. C. §866(c).\nPursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA has subject-matter\njurisdiction to hear respondent’s request for extraordinary\nrelief.\n    Because the NMCCA had jurisdiction over respondent’s\npetition for coram nobis, the CAAF had jurisdiction to\nentertain respondent’s appeal from the NMCCA’s judg\nment. When exercising its jurisdiction, the CAAF’s au\nthority is confined “to matters of law” connected to “the\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority and as affirmed or set aside . . . by the Court of\nCriminal Appeals,” §867(c), but these limitations pose no\nobstacle to respondent’s requested review of the NMCCA’s\ndecision. Respondent’s Sixth Amendment claim presents\na “matte[r] of law” “with respect to the [guilty] findings . . .\nas approved by the [special court-martial] and as affirmed\n. . . by the Court of Criminal Appeals.” Ibid. The CAAF\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction to review the NMCCA’s\ndenial of respondent’s petition challenging the validity of\nhis original conviction.\n                             C\n  The Government counters that Article 76 of the UCMJ,\n10 U. S. C. §876, “affirmatively prohibit[s] the type of\ncollateral review sought by respondent.” Brief for United\nStates 18. That is incorrect. The Government’s argument\ncommits the error of “conflating the jurisdictional question\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the merits” of respondent’s petition. Arthur Andersen\nLLP, ante, at 3. Article 76 states in relevant part:\n       “The appellate review of records of trial provided by\n    this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences\n    of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed\n    as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and\n    discharges carried into execution under sentences by\n    courts-martial following approval, review, or affirma\n    tion as required by this chapter, are final and conclu\n    sive. Orders publishing the proceedings of courts\n    martial and all action taken pursuant to those pro\n    ceedings are binding upon all departments, courts,\n    agencies, and officers of the United States . . . .” 10\n    U. S. C. §876.\nArticle 76 codifies the common-law rule that respects the\nfinality of judgments. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420\nU. S. 738, 749 (1975). Just as the rules of finality did not\njurisdictionally bar the court in Morgan from examining\nits earlier judgment, neither does the principle of finality\nbar the NMCCA from doing so here.\n   The Government may ultimately be correct that the\nfacts of respondent’s case are insufficient to set aside the\nfinal judgment that Article 76 makes binding. No doubt,\njudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside; and courts\nmust be cautious so that the extraordinary remedy of\ncoram nobis issues only in extreme cases. But the long\nrecognized authority of a court to protect the integrity of\nits earlier judgments impels the conclusion that the final\nity rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each and every\ncompeting consideration. Our holding allows military\ncourts to protect the integrity of their dispositions and\nprocesses by granting relief from final judgments in ex\ntraordinary cases when it is shown that there were fun\ndamental flaws in the proceedings leading to their issu\nance.     The Government remains free to argue that\n12               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondent’s is a merely ordinary case that is not entitled\nto extraordinary relief. But respondent’s entitlement to\nrelief is a merits question outside the scope of the jurisdic\ntional question presented.\n   The Government’s contention that coram nobis permits\na court “to correct its own errors, not . . . those of an infe\nrior court,” Brief for United States 36, can be disposed of\non similar grounds. Just as respondent’s request for\ncoram nobis does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction,\nthe Government’s argument that the relief should not\nissue “in light of the writ’s traditional scope” does not\nundermine it, ibid. (emphasis deleted). In sum, the Gov\nernment’s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe NMCCA’s jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected\nthe former argument. Only the latter one is before us.\n   We hold that Article I military courts have jurisdiction\nto entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations\nthat an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a\nfundamental respect. That conclusion is consistent with\nour holding that Article III courts have a like authority.\nMorgan, 346 U. S., at 508. The result we reach today is of\ncentral importance for military courts. The military jus\ntice system relies upon courts that must take all appropri\nate means, consistent with their statutory jurisdiction, to\nensure the neutrality and integrity of their judgments.\nUnder the premises and statutes we have relied upon\nhere, the jurisdiction and the responsibility of military\ncourts to reexamine judgments in rare cases where a\nfundamental flaw is alleged and other judicial processes\nfor correction are unavailable are consistent with the\npowers Congress has granted those courts under Article I\nand with the system Congress has designed.\n                       *     *    *\n  We do not prejudge the merits of respondent’s petition.\nTo be sure, the writ of error coram nobis is an extraordi\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The relative strength of re\nspondent’s ineffective-assistance claim, his delay in lodg\ning his petition, when he learned or should have learned of\nhis counsel’s alleged deficiencies, and the effect of the rule\nof judgment finality expressed in Article 76 are all factors\nthe NMCCA can explore on remand. We hold only that\nthe military appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear\nrespondent’s request for a writ of coram nobis. The judg\nment of the CAAF is affirmed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

JACOB DENEDO\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE ARMED FORCES\n                        [June 8, 2009]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA,\nJUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE ALITO join, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part.\n   The Court’s approach is simple: Jurisdiction to issue\nwrits of coram nobis is a “belated extension” of a court’s\noriginal, statutory jurisdiction. Ante, at 8. The military\ncourts here had original jurisdiction over Denedo’s case.\nThose courts therefore have implicit “extended” jurisdic-\ntion to consider Denedo’s coram nobis petition.\n   The flaw in this syllogism is at the first step: The only\narguable authority for the proposition that coram nobis\njurisdiction marches hand in hand with original jurisdic-\ntion is a footnote in United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502\n(1954), and that case concerned Article III courts. The\nmilitary courts are markedly different. They are Article I\ncourts whose jurisdiction is precisely limited at every turn.\nThose careful limits cannot be overridden by judicial\n“extension” of statutory jurisdiction, or the addition of a\n“further step” to the ones marked out by Congress. Ante,\nat 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   I agree with the majority that this Court has jurisdic-\ntion to review the decision below, but respectfully dissent\nfrom its holding that military courts have jurisdiction to\nissue writs of coram nobis.\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO \n\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J. \n\n\n                               I\n\n   “Traditionally, military justice has been a rough form of\njustice emphasizing summary procedures, speedy convic\ntions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining\nobedience and fighting fitness in the ranks.” Reid v. Cov\nert, 354 U. S. 1, 35–36 (1957) (plurality opinion). Courts\nmartial are composed of active service members who sit\nonly to hear the particular case before them. Once a\ncourt-martial reaches a judgment and imposes a sentence,\nit is dissolved, and its members return to their regular\nduties.\n   Prior to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\nmilitary courts of appeals did not exist. If a service mem\nber wanted to challenge a court-martial conviction, he\npursued a collateral attack in an Article III court. There,\nreview was limited to whether the conviction was void\n“because of lack of jurisdiction or some other equally fun\ndamental defect,” Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, 747 (1975); beyond that, Article III courts adhered to\n“the general rule that the acts of a court martial, within\nthe scope of its jurisdiction and duty, cannot be controlled\nor reviewed in the civil courts,” Smith v. Whitney, 116\nU. S. 167, 177 (1886).\n   The UCMJ established a “complete system of [military]\nreview,” Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plu\nrality opinion), including direct review in what are now\nthe Courts of Criminal Appeals (CCAs) and the Court of\nAppeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). But in keeping\nwith the historical backdrop against which these courts\nwere created, Congress did not grant military courts of\nappeals “broad responsibility with respect to administra\ntion of military justice”; on the contrary, their jurisdiction\nis “narrowly circumscribed” by the governing statutes.\nClinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U. S. 529, 534, 535 (1999) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The CCAs provide direct, record-based review of court\nmartial judgments, but they may only review cases re\nferred by the judge advocate general, who in turn refers\nonly those cases in which specific sentences are imposed.\n10 U. S. C. §§866(b), (c). When reviewing that subset of\ncourt-martial judgments, a CCA “may act only with re\nspect to the findings and sentence as approved by the\nconvening authority.” §866(c). If a case is reviewed by the\nCCA, the CCA’s decision may then be reviewed by the\nCAAF. §867(a). But that court, too, conducts limited\ndirect review: It “may act only with respect to the findings\nand sentence as approved by the convening authority and\nas affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the [CCA].”\n§867(c). Once direct review in the CCA and the CAAF is\ncomplete, and review in this Court is exhausted or waived,\na judgment as to the legality of the court-martial proceed\nings is final, and the sentence imposed may be executed.\n§871(c)(1).\n   The UCMJ provides only one avenue for reconsideration\nof a final court-martial conviction: a petition for a new\ntrial under Article 73. See §873. An Article 73 petition\nmay be brought “within two years after approval by the\nconvening authority of a court-martial sentence,” meaning\nit may be brought before or after a conviction becomes\nfinal. Ibid. If direct review is still pending before a CCA\nor the CAAF when the petition is filed, the judge advocate\ngeneral (to whom the petition must be directed) will refer\nthe petition to that court. Ibid. But once the conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general may act on an Arti\ncle 73 petition. Ibid.\n   Article 76 “ ‘describ[es] the terminal point for proceed\nings within the court-martial system.’ ” Councilman,\nsupra, at 750 (quoting Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U. S. 128,\n132 (1950)). Under that provision, final court-martial\njudgments are “binding upon all departments, courts,\nagencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to\n4                   UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\naction upon a petition for a new trial [under Article 73],”\nor to action by the appropriate Secretary or the President.\n10 U. S. C. §876 (emphasis added). Once an Article 73\npetition is denied, a service member has no relief left to\nseek within the court-martial system. See Gusik, supra,\nat 133–134.1\n   Federal courts are authorized to issue extraordinary\nwrits such as coram nobis only as “necessary or appropri\nate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.” 28 U. S. C.\n§1651(a). The All Writs Act “confine[s] the power of the\nCAAF to issuing process ‘in aid of’ its existing statutory\njurisdiction” and “does not enlarge that jurisdiction.”\nGoldsmith, supra, at 534–535; see also Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969) (although military courts can\nissue extraordinary writs in aid of their direct review\njurisdiction, “[a] different question would, of course, arise\nin a case which the [courts are] not authorized to review\nunder the governing statutes”). The UCMJ grants mili\ntary courts of appeals no jurisdiction over final court\nmartial judgments, so there is no jurisdiction for a post\nconviction extraordinary writ to “aid.” A petition for co\nram nobis by its nature seeks postconviction review; it is\ntherefore beyond the scope of these courts’ “narrowly\ncircumscribed” statutory jurisdiction. Goldsmith, supra,\nat 535.\n                            II\n  The majority overrides these careful limits on military\ncourt jurisdiction by maintaining that later jurisdiction to\n\n——————\n   1 A court-martial conviction may still be collaterally attacked in an\n\nArticle III court, but that is because those courts possess jurisdiction\nbeyond that granted by the UCMJ. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §§2241, 1331.\nWe have repeatedly held that Article 76 “does not expressly effect any\nchange in the subject-matter jurisdiction of Art. III courts.” Schlesinger\nv. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 749 (1975). Our cases have never ques\ntioned that Article 76 limits the jurisdiction of military courts.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

J.\n\nissue coram nobis is a “belated extension” of the statutory\njurisdiction, that “jurisdiction to issue [coram nobis] de\nrives from the earlier jurisdiction.” Ante, at 8, 9. The\nauthority the Court cites for this key jurisdictional analy\nsis is—a footnote. See ante, at 8 (citing Morgan, 346 U. S.,\nat 505, n. 4); ante, at 9 (same). Now, footnotes are part of\nan opinion, too, even if not the most likely place to look for\na key jurisdictional ruling. But since footnote 4 plays such\nan indispensable role in the majority’s analysis, it must be\nread with care.\n   The first thing you notice in doing so is that the footnote\ndoes not mention the word “jurisdiction” at all. That is\nbecause it has nothing to do with jurisdiction. The issue\naddressed in the paragraph to which the footnote was\nappended was “choice of remedy.” 346 U. S., at 505. The\nCourt concluded that coram nobis was the appropriate\none. The footnote simply addressed the concern that the\nremedy might not be available because the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure had abolished coram nobis as a remedy;\nthe concern was dismissed because the Court concluded\nthe criminal rules, not the civil rules, applied. Id., at 505,\nn. 4; see also United States v. Keogh, 391 F. 2d 138, 140\n(CA2 1968) (Friendly, J.) (“The problem to which the\nfootnote was addressed was that F. R. Civ. P. 60(b) had\nabolished writs of error coram nobis”).\n   The point is further confirmed by the text in the body of\nthe opinion: The Court’s conclusion in the paragraph in\nwhich the footnote appears is that since the remedy\nsought was “in the nature of . . . coram nobis,” the trial\ncourt could “properly exercise its jurisdiction.” 346 U. S.,\nat 505 (emphasis added). The issue was not the existence\nof jurisdiction, but whether the court had the authority to\nexercise it. The Court in the present case recognizes the\ndistinction. See ante, at 10 (“When exercising its jurisdic\ntion, the CAAF’s authority is confined to matters of law”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); ante, at 9 (“The au\n6                   UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthority to issue a writ under the All Writs Act is not a font\nof jurisdiction”).\n   Even accepting the majority’s reading of Morgan’s hith\nerto obscure footnote, that reading would only establish\nthe “belated jurisdiction” theory for Article III courts. The\nmilitary courts are Article I courts. The distinction has\ndirect pertinence to the point at issue in this case.\n   Legal doctrines “must be placed in their historical set\nting. They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically\ntransplanted into an alien, unrelated context without\nsuffering mutilation or distortion.” Reid, 354 U. S., at 50\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). The Article III\ncourts have been given broad jurisdiction. I can under\nstand, if not necessarily agree with, the notion that they\nmight enjoy some implicit “long-recognized authority” to\ncorrect their earlier judgments. See ante, at 11. But not\nso for Article I courts. The principle that Congress defines\nthe jurisdiction of the lower federal courts “applies with\nadded force to Article I tribunals.” Ante, at 7. That is\nespecially true with respect to military courts. The mili\ntary justice system is the last place courts should go about\nfinding “extensions” of jurisdiction beyond that conferred\nby statute.\n   As we expressly recognized in Goldsmith, “there is no\nsource of continuing jurisdiction for the CAAF over all\nactions administering sentences that the CAAF at one\ntime had the power to review.” 526 U. S., at 536 (empha\nsis added). Since the UCMJ grants military courts no\npostconviction jurisdiction, conferring on them perpetual\nauthority to entertain coram nobis petitions plainly con\ntravenes that basic principle.2\n——————\n  2 Once you get into the business of extending jurisdiction, it can be\n\nhard to stop. Denedo is no longer in the military. Ante, at 2. Military\ncourts lack jurisdiction over “civilian ex-soldiers who ha[ve] severed all\nrelationship with the military and its institutions.” United States ex\nrel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14 (1955). In the event coram nobis\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009) \n                  7\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J. \n\n\n                             III \n\n   Even if the majority’s reading of Morgan’s footnote could\nbe transplanted to the military context, the majority’s\nconclusion would still not follow. “ ‘[T]he All Writs Act is a\nresidual source of authority to issue writs that are not\notherwise covered by statute. Where a statute specifically\naddresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority,\nand not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.’ ” Carlisle v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 416, 429 (1996) (quoting Pennsyl\nvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals\nService, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985)).\n   The UCMJ contains not one, but two provisions specifi\ncally limiting the circumstances under which postconvic\ntion relief (other than action by the appropriate Secretary\nor the President) may be obtained within the court-martial\nsystem. First, Article 73 provides that, “within two years\nafter approval by the convening authority of a court\nmartial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge\nAdvocate General for a new trial on the grounds of newly\ndiscovered evidence or fraud on the court.” 10 U. S. C.\n§873. The only relief available under this “special post\nconviction remedy” is a new trial, Burns, 346 U. S., at 141\n(plurality opinion), and even that may be granted only in\nan expressly circumscribed timeframe (two years) and set\nof circumstances (newly discovered evidence or fraud on\nthe court). Article 73 stands in stark contrast to coram\nnobis, which the majority characterizes as a writ infinitely\navailable “to redress a[ny] fundamental error.” Ante, at 6;\nsee Morgan, supra, at 512 (“fundamental error” not lim\nited to jurisdictional defects or errors on the face of the\n——————\ndoes issue with respect to a former service member, the Government\nmaintains it would lack jurisdiction to retry. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56–57;\nsee 10 U. S. C. §§802–803. Avoiding that extraordinary result would\nrequire another “belated extension” of the original court-martial pro\nceeding, expanding the jurisdiction of military courts to try individuals\nwho have long since severed their ties to the military.\n8                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nrecord).\n   To be sure, the limited nature of relief available under\nArticle 73 might lead one to question whether that is truly\nthe only postconviction relief the UCMJ permits. “You’re\nin the Army now” is a sufficient answer to such concerns;\nthe relief available looks positively extravagant in light of\nthe prior history and tradition of military justice. In any\nevent, as the majority recognizes, see ante, at 11, Article\n76 makes clear that all court-martial judgments “carried\ninto execution” after completion of direct review are “final\nand conclusive,” 10 U. S. C. §876. Contrary to the major\nity’s assertion, that language does not simply “codif[y] the\ncommon-law rule that respects the finality of judgments.”\nAnte, at 11. In fact, Article 76 does not stop there. It goes\non to instruct that final court-martial judgments are\nbinding “subject only to action upon a petition for a new\ntrial [under Article 73],” or action by the appropriate\nSecretary or the President. 10 U. S. C. §876 (emphasis\nadded).\n   In light of these provisions, only Article 73 provides any\nauthority to the CCAs or the CAAF, and even that narrow\nauthority is limited to pending cases. Once a conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general can provide relief.\nSee supra, at 3; 10 U. S. C. §873. To the extent the CCAs\nor the CAAF could be deemed to have some inherent\ncontinuing authority to issue writs of coram nobis, Articles\n73 and 76 extinguish it.\n                              IV\n  The Government goes on to argue that even if military\ncourts have jurisdiction to issue writs of coram nobis, and\neven if Articles 73 and 76 do not bar such relief, the courts\nstill lack authority to issue coram nobis, because the writ\nis neither “necessary” nor “appropriate” to the court\nmartial system of justice. See 28 U. S. C. §1651(a) (federal\ncourts “may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Coram nobis allows the\ncourt that issued a judgment to correct its own errors of\nfact. See Morgan, 346 U. S., at 507, n. 9 (“ ‘If a judgment\nin the King’s Bench be erroneous in matter of fact only, . . .\nit may be reversed in the same court, by writ of error\ncoram nobis’ ” (quoting 2 W. Tidd, Practice of the Courts of\nKing’s Bench, and Common Pleas 1136 (4th Am. ed. 1856);\nsome emphasis added)); see also ante, at 11 (referring to\n“authority of a court to protect the integrity of its earlier\njudgments” (emphasis added)). But a court-martial is not\na standing court. On a case-by-case basis, “[i]t is called\ninto existence for a special purpose and to perform a par\nticular duty. When the object of its creation has been\naccomplished it is dissolved.” Runkle v. United States, 122\nU. S. 543, 555–556 (1887); see also 66 M. J. 114, 124\n(CAAF 2008) (a court-martial “does not have independent\njurisdiction over a case after the military judge authenti\ncates the record and the convening authority forwards the\nrecord after taking action”). Because the court-martial\nthat issues the conviction no longer exists once the convic\ntion is final, there is no court to which a postconviction\npetition for coram nobis could be directed.\n   The absence of standing courts-martial is no mere tech\nnicality, but rather an integral and intentional part of the\nmilitary justice system. “Court-martial jurisdiction sprang\nfrom the belief that within the military ranks there is need\nfor a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience\nand order.” United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S.\n11, 22 (1955). But meeting that need requires expending\nsignificant military resources, and “[t]o the extent that\nthose responsible for performance of [the military’s] pri\nmary function are diverted from it by the necessity of\ntrying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not\nserved.” Id., at 17. Accordingly, courts-martial, composed\nof active duty military personnel, have always been called\ninto existence for a limited purpose and duration.\n10               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   It is no answer that the CCAs and the CAAF are stand\ning courts that could act as substitutes for coram nobis\npurposes. As this case illustrates, those courts are not\nequipped to handle the kind of factfinding necessary to\nresolve claims that might be brought on coram nobis.\nInstead, the CCAs will have to resort to the procedures\ninvented by United States v. DuBay, 17 U. S. C. M. A. 147,\n37 C. M. R. 411 (1967), under which a new convening\nauthority will refer a case to a new court-martial, and task\nvarious military personnel who have no prior familiarity\nwith the case to conduct an out-of-court evidentiary hear\ning on the merits of the petitioner’s claim. Id., at 149, 37\nC. M. R., at 413. This “unwieldy and imperfect system”\nwill undoubtedly divert valuable military resources, 66\nM. J., at 136 (Ryan, J., dissenting), all in aid of postconvic\ntion relief Congress specifically withheld.\n   The Court expressly declines to consider the Govern\nment’s “necessary or appropriate” argument: “[T]he Gov\nernment’s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe [CCA’s] jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected the\nformer argument. Only the latter one is before us.” Ante,\nat 12. The Court may well be correct in dividing the ques\ntions into separate pigeonholes. But the Government’s\nargument, even if an argument about authority rather\nthan jurisdiction, applies to every coram nobis case, given\nthe nature of the military justice system. It is curious to\nconclude that military courts have jurisdiction, while not\nconsidering a raised and briefed argument that they may\nnever exercise it.\n                       *     *     *\n   Since the adoption of the UCMJ, “Congress has gradu\nally changed the system of military justice so that it has\ncome to more closely resemble the civilian system.” Weiss\nv. United States, 510 U. S. 163, 174 (1994). “But the mili\ntary in important respects remains a specialized society\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nseparate from civilian society.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Neither the jurisdiction nor the powers of\nArticle III courts are necessarily appropriate for military\ncourts, and Congress’s contrary determinations in this\narea are entitled to “the highest deference.” Loving v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 748, 768 (1996). Rather than\nrespect the rule that military courts have no jurisdiction to\nrevisit final convictions, the majority creates an exception\nthat swallows it. Because I would hold the military courts\nto the statutory restraints that govern them, I respectfully\ndissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145866, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/06/08/United_States_v._Denedo.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 25, 2009—Decided June 8, 2009\nMilitary authorities charged respondent, a native Nigerian serving in\n the U. S. Navy, with violating of the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n (UCMJ). With counsel’s assistance, respondent agreed to plead\n guilty to reduced charges. The special court-martial accepted the\n plea and convicted and sentenced respondent; the Navy-Marine\n Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA) affirmed; and he was dis\n charged from the Navy in 2000. In 2006, the Department of Home\n land Security commenced removal proceedings against respondent\n based on the conviction. To avoid deportation, he filed a petition for a\n writ of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs Act, asking\n the NMCCA to vacate the conviction it had earlier affirmed on the\n ground that his guilty plea resulted from ineffective assistance of\n counsel, who had assured him his plea bargain carried no risk of de\n portation. Though rejecting the Government’s contention that it\n lacked jurisdiction to grant the writ, the NMCCA denied relief for\n lack of merit. Agreeing that the NMCCA has jurisdiction, the Court\n of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) remanded for further pro\n ceedings on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.\n §1259(4), which permits it to review CAAF decisions in cases “in\n which [that court] granted relief.” Respondent’s parsimonious view\n that the CAAF did not “ ‘gran[t] relief’ ” in this case, but simply re\n manded to the NMCCA, is rejected. Though §1259 does not define\n “relief,” the word’s familiar meaning encompasses any redress or\n benefit provided by a court. The CAAF’s judgment reversing the\n NMCCA satisfies that definition.

As recognized by the All Writs\n    Act—which permits “courts established by Act of Congress” to issue\n    “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic\n    tions,” 28 U. S. C. §1651(a)—a court’s power to issue any form of re\n    lief, extraordinary or otherwise, is contingent on its subject-matter\n    jurisdiction over the case or controversy. Such jurisdiction is deter\n    mined by Congress. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212. Thus, to\n    issue respondent a writ of coram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must\n    have had statutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent’s\n    original judgment of conviction. Pp. 5–8.\n          (b) Pursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA and the CAAF have sub\n    ject-matter jurisdiction over this case. The NMCCA has jurisdiction\n    to entertain respondent’s coram nobis request under UCMJ Article\n    66, which provides: “For the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases,\n    the [NMCCA] may sit . . . .” 10 U. S. C. §866(a). Because respon\n    dent’s coram nobis request is simply a further “step in [his] criminal”\n    appeal, United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 505 n. 4, the\n    NMCCA’s jurisdiction to issue the writ derives from the earlier juris\n    diction it exercised under §866(a) to hear and determine the convic\n    tion’s validity on direct review. Respondent’s coram nobis request is\n    not barred by the requirement that the NMCCA “act only with re\n    spect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening au\n    thority.” §866(c). An alleged error in the original judgment predi\n    cated on ineffective-assistance-of-counsel challenges the conviction’s\n    validity, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at ___, so respondent’s\n    Sixth Amendment claim is “with respect to” the special-court\n    martial’s “findings” of guilty. Because the NMCCA has jurisdiction,\n    the CAAF has jurisdiction to review the NMCCA’s denial of respon\n    dent’s petition challenging the validity of his original conviction.\n    That the CAAF’s authority is confined “to matters of law” connected\n    to “the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority\n    and as affirmed or set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeals,”\n    §867(c), poses no obstacle to respondent’s requested review. His\n    Sixth Amendment claim presents a “matte[r] of law” “with respect to\n    the [guilty] findings . . . as approved by the [special court-martial]\n    and as affirmed . . . by” the NMCCA. Pp. 8–10.\n          (c) The Government’s argument that UCMJ Article 76 affirma\n    tively prohibits the type of collateral review respondent seeks errs in\n    “conflating the jurisdictional question with the merits” of respon\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

The military court which had affirmed the conviction\nand where the writ of coram nobis was sought is the Navy-\nMarine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals (NMCCA). Its\nruling that it had jurisdiction to grant the writ, but then\ndenying its issuance for lack of merit, was appealed to the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\n(CAAF). After the CAAF agreed that the NMCCA has\njurisdiction to issue the writ, it remanded for further\nproceedings on the merits. The Government of the United\nStates, contending that a writ of coram nobis directed to a\nfinal judgment of conviction is beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe military courts, now brings the case to us.\n                            I\n  Respondent Jacob Denedo came to the United States in\n1984 from his native Nigeria. He enlisted in the Navy in\n1989 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1990. In\n1998, military authorities charged him with conspiracy,\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlarceny, and forgery—in contravention of Articles 81, 121,\nand 123 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\n10 U. S. C. §§881, 921, 923—all for his role in a scheme to\ndefraud a community college. With the assistance of both\nmilitary and civilian counsel, respondent made a plea\nbargain to plead guilty to reduced charges. In exchange\nfor his plea the convening authority referred respondent’s\ncase to a special court-martial, §819, which, at that time,\ncould not impose a sentence greater than six months’\nconfinement.\n    The special court-martial, consisting of a single military\njudge, accepted respondent’s guilty plea after determining\nthat it was both knowing and voluntary. The court con\nvicted respondent of conspiracy and larceny. It sentenced\nhim to three months’ confinement, a bad-conduct dis\ncharge, and a reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade.\nRespondent appealed on the ground that his sentence was\nunduly severe. The NMCCA affirmed. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 64a–67a. Respondent did not seek further review in\nthe CAAF, and he was discharged from the Navy on May\n30, 2000.\n    In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security com\nmenced removal proceedings against respondent based\nupon his special court-martial conviction. To avoid depor\ntation, respondent decided to challenge his conviction once\nmore, though at this point it had been final for eight years.\nHe maintained, in a petition for a writ of coram nobis filed\nwith the NMCCA, that the conviction it had earlier af\nfirmed must be deemed void because his guilty plea was\nthe result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Respondent\nalleged that he informed his civilian attorney during plea\nnegotiations that “ ‘his primary concern and objective’ ”\nwas to avoid deportation and that he was willing to “ ‘risk\n. . . going to jail’ ” to avert separation from his family. 66\nM. J. 114, 118 (C. A. Armed Forces 2008). On respon\ndent’s account, his attorney—an alcoholic who was not\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsober during the course of the special court-martial pro\nceeding—erroneously assured him that “ ‘if he agreed to\nplead guilty at a special-court-martial he would avoid any\nrisk of deportation.’ ” Ibid. Petitioner argued that the\nNMCCA could set aside its earlier decision by issuing a\nwrit of coram nobis under the authority of the All Writs\nAct, 28 U. S. C. §1651(a).\n   The Government filed a motion to dismiss for want of\njurisdiction. It contended that the NMCCA had no author\nity to conduct postconviction proceedings. In a terse, four\nsentence order, the NMCCA summarily denied both the\nGovernment’s motion and respondent’s petition for a writ\nof coram nobis. App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a. Respondent\nappealed and the CAAF, dividing 3 to 2, affirmed in part\nand reversed in part. The CAAF agreed with the NMCCA\nthat standing military courts have jurisdiction to conduct\n“collateral review under the All Writs Act.” 66 M. J., at\n119. This is so, the CAAF explained, because “when a\npetitioner seeks collateral relief to modify an action that\nwas taken within the subject matter jurisdiction of the\nmilitary justice system . . . a writ that is necessary or\nappropriate may be issued under the All Writs Act ‘in aid\nof’ the court’s existing jurisdiction.” Id., at 120 (citing 28\nU. S. C. §1651(a)).\n   Satisfied that it had jurisdiction, the CAAF next turned\nto whether the writ of coram nobis should issue. It held\nthat a nondefaulted, ineffective-assistance claim that was\nyet to receive a full and fair review “within the military\njustice system” could justify issuance of the writ. 66 M. J.,\nat 125. Finding that respondent’s ineffective-assistance\nclaim satisfied “the threshold criteria for coram nobis\nreview,” the CAAF remanded to the NMCCA so it could\nascertain in the first instance “whether the merits of\n[respondent’s] petition can be resolved on the basis of the\nwritten submissions, or whether a factfinding hearing is\nrequired.” Id., at 126, 130.\n4                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Judge Stucky filed a dissenting opinion. Assuming that\nthe majority had correctly determined its jurisdiction to\ngrant the requested relief, he concluded that respondent’s\nineffective-assistance claim lacked merit. Id., at 131.\nJudge Ryan also dissented. Reasoning that the majority\nhad misapplied this Court’s holding in Clinton v. Gold\nsmith, 526 U. S. 529 (1999), she concluded that the UCMJ\ndoes not confer jurisdiction upon military tribunals to\nconduct “post-finality collateral review.” 66 M. J., at 136.\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\naffirm.\n                             II\n   Before we address another court’s subject-matter juris\ndiction we must first determine our own. See Ashcroft v.\nIqbal, ante, at 6 (“Subject-matter jurisdiction . . . should be\nconsidered when fairly in doubt”). The Government, upon\nwhich the burden to demonstrate subject-matter jurisdic\ntion lies, DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332,\n342 (2006), claims that our power to hear this appeal rests\non 28 U. S. C. §1259(4). That jurisdictional provision\npermits us to review CAAF decisions in “ ‘cases . . . in\nwhich the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces . . .\ngranted relief.’ ” Respondent maintains that we lack\njurisdiction because the CAAF did not “ ‘grant relief’ ”; “all\nit did was remand” to the NMCCA. Brief for Respondent\n6–7 (brackets omitted).\n   Respondent’s parsimonious construction of the word\n“relief” need not detain us long. Though §1259 does not\ndefine the term, its familiar meaning encompasses any\n“redress or benefit” provided by a court. Black’s Law\nDictionary 1317 (8th ed. 2004). The CAAF’s judgment\nreversing the NMCCA satisfies that definition. The\nNMCCA denied respondent’s petition for a writ of coram\nnobis, while the CAAF’s decision reversed and remanded\nso that the NMCCA could determine anew if the writ\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nshould issue. That decision conferred a palpable benefit\non respondent; for a chance of success on the merits, how\never slight, is superior to no possibility at all.\n  To be sure, respondent would have preferred the CAAF\nto issue a writ of coram nobis or to direct the NMCCA to\ndo so rather than remanding for the NMCCA to conduct\nfurther proceedings. We have jurisdiction, however, to\nreview any decision granting “relief,” not just those provid\ning “ultimate relief” or “complete relief.” Indeed, appellate\ncourts reverse and remand lower court judgments—rather\nthan issuing complete relief—with regularity. See, e.g.,\nArthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, ante, at ___; FCC v. Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., ante, at ___. There is no merit to\nthe view that a decision granting partial relief should be\nconstrued as granting no relief at all.\n  Because the CAAF “granted relief” to respondent, the\ntext of §1259 is satisfied here. We have jurisdiction to\ndetermine whether the CAAF was correct in ruling that\nthe NMCCA had authority to entertain the petition for a\nwrit of coram nobis.\n                             III\n                              A\n  The writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law\nremedy designed “to correct errors of fact.” United States\nv. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 507 (1954). In American juris\nprudence the precise contours of coram nobis have not\nbeen “well defined,” Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U. S. 410,\n416 (1882), but the writ traces its origins to the King’s\nBench and the Court of Common Pleas. United States v.\nPlumer, 27 F. Cas. 561, 573 (No. 16,056) (CC Mass. 1859)\n(opinion for the court by Clifford, Circuit Justice); see also\nMorgan, supra, at 507, n. 9 (citing 2 W. Tidd, Practice of\nCourts of King’s Bench and Common Pleas *1136–*1137).\nIn English practice the office of the writ was to foster\nrespect for judicial rulings by enabling the same court\n6               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“where the action was commenced and where the judg\nment was rendered” to avoid the rigid strictures of judg\nment finality by correcting technical errors “such as hap\npened through the fault of the clerk in the record of the\nproceedings prior to the judgment.” Plumer, supra, at\n572–573.\n   Any rationale confining the writ to technical errors,\nhowever, has been superseded; for in its modern iteration\ncoram nobis is broader than its common-law predecessor.\nThis is confirmed by our opinion in Morgan. In that case\nwe found that a writ of coram nobis can issue to redress a\nfundamental error, there a deprivation of counsel in viola\ntion of the Sixth Amendment, as opposed to mere technical\nerrors. 346 U. S., at 513. The potential universe of cases\nthat range from technical errors to fundamental ones\nperhaps illustrates, in the case of coram nobis, the “ten\ndency of a principle to expand itself to the limit of its\nlogic.” B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 51\n(1921). To confine the use of coram nobis so that finality\nis not at risk in a great number of cases, we were careful\nin Morgan to limit the availability of the writ to “extraor\ndinary” cases presenting circumstances compelling its use\n“to achieve justice.” 346 U. S., at 511. Another limit, of\ncourse, is that an extraordinary remedy may not issue\nwhen alternative remedies, such as habeas corpus, are\navailable. See id., at 510–511.\n   In federal courts the authority to grant a writ of coram\nnobis is conferred by the All Writs Act, which permits\n“courts established by Act of Congress” to issue “all writs\nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdic\ntions.” 28 U. S. C. §1651(a). Though military courts, like\nArticle III tribunals, are empowered to issue extraordi\nnary writs under the All Writs Act, Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969), that authority does not deter\nmine the anterior question whether military courts have\njurisdiction to entertain a petition for coram nobis.

S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntext of the All Writs Act recognizes, a court’s power to\nissue any form of relief—extraordinary or otherwise—is\ncontingent on that court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe case or controversy.\n   Assuming no constraints or limitations grounded in the\nConstitution are implicated, it is for Congress to deter\nmine the subject-matter jurisdiction of federal courts.\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 212 (2007) (“Within\nconstitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the\nfederal courts have jurisdiction to consider”). This rule\napplies with added force to Article I tribunals, such as the\nNMCCA and CAAF, which owe their existence to Con\ngress’ authority to enact legislation pursuant to Art. I, §8\nof the Constitution. Goldsmith, 526 U. S., at 533–534.\n   Our decision in Goldsmith demonstrates these teach\nings. There an Air Force officer, James Goldsmith, was\nconvicted of various crimes by general court-martial and\nsentenced to six years’ confinement. Id., at 531. Follow\ning his conviction, Congress enacted a statute authorizing\nthe President to drop convicted officers from the rolls of\nthe Armed Forces. When the Air Force notified Goldsmith\nthat he would be dropped from the rolls, he lodged a peti\ntion before the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals\n(AFCCA) claiming that the proposed action contravened\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. Id., at 532–\n533. Goldsmith sought extraordinary relief as authorized\nby the All Writs Act to enjoin the President from removing\nhim from the rolls. The AFCCA denied relief, but the\nCAAF granted it.\n   Concluding that the UCMJ does not authorize military\ncourts to review executive action—including a decision to\ndrop an officer from the rolls—we held that the AFCCA\nand the CAAF lacked jurisdiction over Goldsmith’s case.\nId., at 535. This was so, we unequivocally found, irrespec\ntive of the military court’s authority to issue extraordinary\nrelief pursuant to the All Writs Act and its previous juris\n8                 UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndiction over Goldsmith’s criminal proceeding. The power\nto issue relief depends upon, rather than enlarges, a\ncourt’s jurisdiction. Id., at 536–537.\n   That principle does not control the question before us.\nBecause coram nobis is but an extraordinary tool to cor\nrect a legal or factual error, an application for the writ is\nproperly viewed as a belated extension of the original\nproceeding during which the error allegedly transpired.\nSee Morgan, supra, at 505, n. 4 (coram nobis is “a step in\nthe criminal case and not, like habeas corpus where relief\nis sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a\nseparate civil proceeding”); see also United States v. Beg\ngerly, 524 U. S. 38, 46 (1998) (citing Pacific R. Co. of Mo. v.\nMissouri Pacific R. Co., 111 U. S. 505, 522 (1884) (noting\nthat an “independent action”—which, like coram nobis, is\nan equitable means to obtain relief from a judgment—\n“ ‘may be regarded as ancillary to the prior suit, so that the\nrelief asked may be granted by the court which made the\ndecree in that suit . . . . The bill, though an original bill in\nthe chancery sense of the word, is a continuation of the\nformer suit, on the question of the jurisdiction of the\n[court]’ ”). It follows that to issue respondent a writ of\ncoram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must have had\nstatutory subject-matter jurisdiction over respondent’s\noriginal judgment of conviction.\n                                B\n   In the critical part of its opinion discussing the jurisdic\ntion and authority of the NMCCA to issue a writ of coram\nnobis in an appropriate case, the CAAF describes respon\ndent’s request for review as one “under the All Writs Act.”\n66 M. J., at 119. This is correct, of course, if it simply\nconfirms that the Act authorizes federal courts to issue\nwrits “in aid of” their jurisdiction; but it does not advance\nthe inquiry into whether jurisdiction exists.\n   And there are limits to the use of coram nobis to alter or\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninterpret earlier judgments. As Goldsmith makes plain,\nthe All Writs Act and the extraordinary relief the statute\nauthorizes are not a source of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n526 U. S., at 534–535. Statutes which address the power\nof a court to use certain writs or remedies or to decree\ncertain forms of relief, for instance to award damages in\nsome specified measure, in some circumstances might be\nconstrued also as a grant of jurisdiction to hear and de\ntermine the underlying cause of action. Cf. Marbury v.\nMadison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). We have long held, how\never, that the All Writs Act should not be interpreted in\nthis way. Goldsmith, supra, at 536; Plumer, 27 F. Cas., at\n574 (jurisdiction cannot be acquired “by means of the writ\nto be issued”). The authority to issue a writ under the All\nWrits Act is not a font of jurisdiction. See Syngenta Crop\nProtection, Inc. v. Henson, 537 U. S. 28, 31 (2002).\n   Quite apart from the All Writs Act, we conclude that the\nNMCCA has jurisdiction to entertain respondent’s request\nfor a writ of coram nobis. Article 66 of the UCMJ pro\nvides: “For the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases,\nthe [Court of Criminal Appeals] may sit . . . .” 10 U. S. C.\n§866(a). Because respondent’s request for coram nobis is\nsimply a further “step in [his] criminal” appeal, Morgan,\n346 U. S., at 505, n. 4, the NMCCA’s jurisdiction to issue\nthe writ derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised to\nhear and determine the validity of the conviction on direct\nreview. As even the Government concedes, the textual\nauthority under the UCMJ to “ ‘revie[w] court-martial\ncases’ ” provided the NMCCA with jurisdiction to hear an\nappeal of respondent’s judgment of conviction. See Brief\nfor United States 17–18. That jurisdiction is sufficient to\npermit the NMCCA to entertain respondent’s petition for\ncoram nobis. See also Courts of Criminal Appeals Rule of\nPractice and Procedure 2(b) (recognizing NMCCA discre\ntionary authority to entertain petitions for extraordinary\nwrits).\n10                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    It is true that when exercising its jurisdiction under\n§866(a), the NMCCA “may act only with respect to the\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority.” §866(c). That limitation does not bar respon\ndent’s request for a writ of coram nobis. An alleged error\nin the original judgment predicated on ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel challenges the validity of a convic\ntion, see Knowles v. Mirzayance, ante, at 3, so respondent’s\nSixth Amendment claim is “with respect to” the special\ncourt-martial’s “findings of guilty,” 10 U. S. C. §866(c).\nPursuant to the UCMJ, the NMCCA has subject-matter\njurisdiction to hear respondent’s request for extraordinary\nrelief.\n    Because the NMCCA had jurisdiction over respondent’s\npetition for coram nobis, the CAAF had jurisdiction to\nentertain respondent’s appeal from the NMCCA’s judg\nment. When exercising its jurisdiction, the CAAF’s au\nthority is confined “to matters of law” connected to “the\nfindings and sentence as approved by the convening au\nthority and as affirmed or set aside . . . by the Court of\nCriminal Appeals,” §867(c), but these limitations pose no\nobstacle to respondent’s requested review of the NMCCA’s\ndecision. Respondent’s Sixth Amendment claim presents\na “matte[r] of law” “with respect to the [guilty] findings . . .\nas approved by the [special court-martial] and as affirmed\n. . . by the Court of Criminal Appeals.” Ibid. The CAAF\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction to review the NMCCA’s\ndenial of respondent’s petition challenging the validity of\nhis original conviction.\n                             C\n  The Government counters that Article 76 of the UCMJ,\n10 U. S. C. §876, “affirmatively prohibit[s] the type of\ncollateral review sought by respondent.” Brief for United\nStates 18. That is incorrect. The Government’s argument\ncommits the error of “conflating the jurisdictional question\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the merits” of respondent’s petition. Arthur Andersen\nLLP, ante, at 3. Article 76 states in relevant part:\n       “The appellate review of records of trial provided by\n    this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences\n    of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed\n    as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and\n    discharges carried into execution under sentences by\n    courts-martial following approval, review, or affirma\n    tion as required by this chapter, are final and conclu\n    sive. Orders publishing the proceedings of courts\n    martial and all action taken pursuant to those pro\n    ceedings are binding upon all departments, courts,\n    agencies, and officers of the United States . . . .” 10\n    U. S. C. §876.\nArticle 76 codifies the common-law rule that respects the\nfinality of judgments. Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420\nU. S. 738, 749 (1975). Just as the rules of finality did not\njurisdictionally bar the court in Morgan from examining\nits earlier judgment, neither does the principle of finality\nbar the NMCCA from doing so here.\n   The Government may ultimately be correct that the\nfacts of respondent’s case are insufficient to set aside the\nfinal judgment that Article 76 makes binding. No doubt,\njudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside; and courts\nmust be cautious so that the extraordinary remedy of\ncoram nobis issues only in extreme cases. But the long\nrecognized authority of a court to protect the integrity of\nits earlier judgments impels the conclusion that the final\nity rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each and every\ncompeting consideration. Our holding allows military\ncourts to protect the integrity of their dispositions and\nprocesses by granting relief from final judgments in ex\ntraordinary cases when it is shown that there were fun\ndamental flaws in the proceedings leading to their issu\nance.     The Government remains free to argue that\n12               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrespondent’s is a merely ordinary case that is not entitled\nto extraordinary relief. But respondent’s entitlement to\nrelief is a merits question outside the scope of the jurisdic\ntional question presented.\n   The Government’s contention that coram nobis permits\na court “to correct its own errors, not . . . those of an infe\nrior court,” Brief for United States 36, can be disposed of\non similar grounds. Just as respondent’s request for\ncoram nobis does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction,\nthe Government’s argument that the relief should not\nissue “in light of the writ’s traditional scope” does not\nundermine it, ibid. (emphasis deleted). In sum, the Gov\nernment’s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe NMCCA’s jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected\nthe former argument. Only the latter one is before us.\n   We hold that Article I military courts have jurisdiction\nto entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations\nthat an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a\nfundamental respect. That conclusion is consistent with\nour holding that Article III courts have a like authority.\nMorgan, 346 U. S., at 508. The result we reach today is of\ncentral importance for military courts. The military jus\ntice system relies upon courts that must take all appropri\nate means, consistent with their statutory jurisdiction, to\nensure the neutrality and integrity of their judgments.\nUnder the premises and statutes we have relied upon\nhere, the jurisdiction and the responsibility of military\ncourts to reexamine judgments in rare cases where a\nfundamental flaw is alleged and other judicial processes\nfor correction are unavailable are consistent with the\npowers Congress has granted those courts under Article I\nand with the system Congress has designed.\n                       *     *    *\n  We do not prejudge the merits of respondent’s petition.\nTo be sure, the writ of error coram nobis is an extraordi\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Holder, ante, at 1\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring). The relative strength of re\nspondent’s ineffective-assistance claim, his delay in lodg\ning his petition, when he learned or should have learned of\nhis counsel’s alleged deficiencies, and the effect of the rule\nof judgment finality expressed in Article 76 are all factors\nthe NMCCA can explore on remand. We hold only that\nthe military appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear\nrespondent’s request for a writ of coram nobis. The judg\nment of the CAAF is affirmed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Ante, at 8. The military\ncourts here had original jurisdiction over Denedo’s case.\nThose courts therefore have implicit “extended” jurisdic-\ntion to consider Denedo’s coram nobis petition.\n   The flaw in this syllogism is at the first step: The only\narguable authority for the proposition that coram nobis\njurisdiction marches hand in hand with original jurisdic-\ntion is a footnote in United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502\n(1954), and that case concerned Article III courts. The\nmilitary courts are markedly different. They are Article I\ncourts whose jurisdiction is precisely limited at every turn.\nThose careful limits cannot be overridden by judicial\n“extension” of statutory jurisdiction, or the addition of a\n“further step” to the ones marked out by Congress. Ante,\nat 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   I agree with the majority that this Court has jurisdic-\ntion to review the decision below, but respectfully dissent\nfrom its holding that military courts have jurisdiction to\nissue writs of coram nobis.\n2                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO \n\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J. \n\n\n                               I\n\n   “Traditionally, military justice has been a rough form of\njustice emphasizing summary procedures, speedy convic\ntions and stern penalties with a view to maintaining\nobedience and fighting fitness in the ranks.” Reid v. Cov\nert, 354 U. S. 1, 35–36 (1957) (plurality opinion). Courts\nmartial are composed of active service members who sit\nonly to hear the particular case before them. Once a\ncourt-martial reaches a judgment and imposes a sentence,\nit is dissolved, and its members return to their regular\nduties.\n   Prior to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),\nmilitary courts of appeals did not exist. If a service mem\nber wanted to challenge a court-martial conviction, he\npursued a collateral attack in an Article III court. There,\nreview was limited to whether the conviction was void\n“because of lack of jurisdiction or some other equally fun\ndamental defect,” Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S.\n738, 747 (1975); beyond that, Article III courts adhered to\n“the general rule that the acts of a court martial, within\nthe scope of its jurisdiction and duty, cannot be controlled\nor reviewed in the civil courts,” Smith v. Whitney, 116\nU. S. 167, 177 (1886).\n   The UCMJ established a “complete system of [military]\nreview,” Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plu\nrality opinion), including direct review in what are now\nthe Courts of Criminal Appeals (CCAs) and the Court of\nAppeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF). But in keeping\nwith the historical backdrop against which these courts\nwere created, Congress did not grant military courts of\nappeals “broad responsibility with respect to administra\ntion of military justice”; on the contrary, their jurisdiction\nis “narrowly circumscribed” by the governing statutes.\nClinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U. S. 529, 534, 535 (1999) (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   The CCAs provide direct, record-based review of court\nmartial judgments, but they may only review cases re\nferred by the judge advocate general, who in turn refers\nonly those cases in which specific sentences are imposed.\n10 U. S. C. §§866(b), (c). When reviewing that subset of\ncourt-martial judgments, a CCA “may act only with re\nspect to the findings and sentence as approved by the\nconvening authority.” §866(c). If a case is reviewed by the\nCCA, the CCA’s decision may then be reviewed by the\nCAAF. §867(a). But that court, too, conducts limited\ndirect review: It “may act only with respect to the findings\nand sentence as approved by the convening authority and\nas affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the [CCA].”\n§867(c). Once direct review in the CCA and the CAAF is\ncomplete, and review in this Court is exhausted or waived,\na judgment as to the legality of the court-martial proceed\nings is final, and the sentence imposed may be executed.\n§871(c)(1).\n   The UCMJ provides only one avenue for reconsideration\nof a final court-martial conviction: a petition for a new\ntrial under Article 73. See §873. An Article 73 petition\nmay be brought “within two years after approval by the\nconvening authority of a court-martial sentence,” meaning\nit may be brought before or after a conviction becomes\nfinal. Ibid. If direct review is still pending before a CCA\nor the CAAF when the petition is filed, the judge advocate\ngeneral (to whom the petition must be directed) will refer\nthe petition to that court. Ibid. But once the conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general may act on an Arti\ncle 73 petition. Ibid.\n   Article 76 “ ‘describ[es] the terminal point for proceed\nings within the court-martial system.’ ” Councilman,\nsupra, at 750 (quoting Gusik v. Schilder, 340 U. S. 128,\n132 (1950)). Under that provision, final court-martial\njudgments are “binding upon all departments, courts,\nagencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to\n4                   UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\naction upon a petition for a new trial [under Article 73],”\nor to action by the appropriate Secretary or the President.\n10 U. S. C. §876 (emphasis added). Once an Article 73\npetition is denied, a service member has no relief left to\nseek within the court-martial system. See Gusik, supra,\nat 133–134.1\n   Federal courts are authorized to issue extraordinary\nwrits such as coram nobis only as “necessary or appropri\nate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.” 28 U. S. C.\n§1651(a). The All Writs Act “confine[s] the power of the\nCAAF to issuing process ‘in aid of’ its existing statutory\njurisdiction” and “does not enlarge that jurisdiction.”\nGoldsmith, supra, at 534–535; see also Noyd v. Bond, 395\nU. S. 683, 695, n. 7 (1969) (although military courts can\nissue extraordinary writs in aid of their direct review\njurisdiction, “[a] different question would, of course, arise\nin a case which the [courts are] not authorized to review\nunder the governing statutes”). The UCMJ grants mili\ntary courts of appeals no jurisdiction over final court\nmartial judgments, so there is no jurisdiction for a post\nconviction extraordinary writ to “aid.” A petition for co\nram nobis by its nature seeks postconviction review; it is\ntherefore beyond the scope of these courts’ “narrowly\ncircumscribed” statutory jurisdiction. Goldsmith, supra,\nat 535.\n                            II\n  The majority overrides these careful limits on military\ncourt jurisdiction by maintaining that later jurisdiction to\n\n——————\n   1 A court-martial conviction may still be collaterally attacked in an\n\nArticle III court, but that is because those courts possess jurisdiction\nbeyond that granted by the UCMJ. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §§2241, 1331.\nWe have repeatedly held that Article 76 “does not expressly effect any\nchange in the subject-matter jurisdiction of Art. III courts.” Schlesinger\nv. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 749 (1975). Our cases have never ques\ntioned that Article 76 limits the jurisdiction of military courts.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nissue coram nobis is a “belated extension” of the statutory\njurisdiction, that “jurisdiction to issue [coram nobis] de\nrives from the earlier jurisdiction.” Ante, at 8, 9. The\nauthority the Court cites for this key jurisdictional analy\nsis is—a footnote. See ante, at 8 (citing Morgan, 346 U. S.,\nat 505, n. 4); ante, at 9 (same). Now, footnotes are part of\nan opinion, too, even if not the most likely place to look for\na key jurisdictional ruling. But since footnote 4 plays such\nan indispensable role in the majority’s analysis, it must be\nread with care.\n   The first thing you notice in doing so is that the footnote\ndoes not mention the word “jurisdiction” at all. That is\nbecause it has nothing to do with jurisdiction. The issue\naddressed in the paragraph to which the footnote was\nappended was “choice of remedy.” 346 U. S., at 505. The\nCourt concluded that coram nobis was the appropriate\none. The footnote simply addressed the concern that the\nremedy might not be available because the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure had abolished coram nobis as a remedy;\nthe concern was dismissed because the Court concluded\nthe criminal rules, not the civil rules, applied. Id., at 505,\nn. 4; see also United States v. Keogh, 391 F. 2d 138, 140\n(CA2 1968) (Friendly, J.) (“The problem to which the\nfootnote was addressed was that F. R. Civ. P. 60(b) had\nabolished writs of error coram nobis”).\n   The point is further confirmed by the text in the body of\nthe opinion: The Court’s conclusion in the paragraph in\nwhich the footnote appears is that since the remedy\nsought was “in the nature of . . . coram nobis,” the trial\ncourt could “properly exercise its jurisdiction.” 346 U. S.,\nat 505 (emphasis added). The issue was not the existence\nof jurisdiction, but whether the court had the authority to\nexercise it. The Court in the present case recognizes the\ndistinction. See ante, at 10 (“When exercising its jurisdic\ntion, the CAAF’s authority is confined to matters of law”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); ante, at 9 (“The au\n6                   UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthority to issue a writ under the All Writs Act is not a font\nof jurisdiction”).\n   Even accepting the majority’s reading of Morgan’s hith\nerto obscure footnote, that reading would only establish\nthe “belated jurisdiction” theory for Article III courts. The\nmilitary courts are Article I courts. The distinction has\ndirect pertinence to the point at issue in this case.\n   Legal doctrines “must be placed in their historical set\nting. They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically\ntransplanted into an alien, unrelated context without\nsuffering mutilation or distortion.” Reid, 354 U. S., at 50\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). The Article III\ncourts have been given broad jurisdiction. I can under\nstand, if not necessarily agree with, the notion that they\nmight enjoy some implicit “long-recognized authority” to\ncorrect their earlier judgments. See ante, at 11. But not\nso for Article I courts. The principle that Congress defines\nthe jurisdiction of the lower federal courts “applies with\nadded force to Article I tribunals.” Ante, at 7. That is\nespecially true with respect to military courts. The mili\ntary justice system is the last place courts should go about\nfinding “extensions” of jurisdiction beyond that conferred\nby statute.\n   As we expressly recognized in Goldsmith, “there is no\nsource of continuing jurisdiction for the CAAF over all\nactions administering sentences that the CAAF at one\ntime had the power to review.” 526 U. S., at 536 (empha\nsis added). Since the UCMJ grants military courts no\npostconviction jurisdiction, conferring on them perpetual\nauthority to entertain coram nobis petitions plainly con\ntravenes that basic principle.2\n——————\n  2 Once you get into the business of extending jurisdiction, it can be\n\nhard to stop. Denedo is no longer in the military. Ante, at 2. Military\ncourts lack jurisdiction over “civilian ex-soldiers who ha[ve] severed all\nrelationship with the military and its institutions.” United States ex\nrel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14 (1955). In the event coram nobis\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009) \n                  7\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

Where a statute specifically\naddresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority,\nand not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.’ ” Carlisle v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 416, 429 (1996) (quoting Pennsyl\nvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals\nService, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985)).\n   The UCMJ contains not one, but two provisions specifi\ncally limiting the circumstances under which postconvic\ntion relief (other than action by the appropriate Secretary\nor the President) may be obtained within the court-martial\nsystem. First, Article 73 provides that, “within two years\nafter approval by the convening authority of a court\nmartial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge\nAdvocate General for a new trial on the grounds of newly\ndiscovered evidence or fraud on the court.” 10 U. S. C.\n§873. The only relief available under this “special post\nconviction remedy” is a new trial, Burns, 346 U. S., at 141\n(plurality opinion), and even that may be granted only in\nan expressly circumscribed timeframe (two years) and set\nof circumstances (newly discovered evidence or fraud on\nthe court). Article 73 stands in stark contrast to coram\nnobis, which the majority characterizes as a writ infinitely\navailable “to redress a[ny] fundamental error.” Ante, at 6;\nsee Morgan, supra, at 512 (“fundamental error” not lim\nited to jurisdictional defects or errors on the face of the\n——————\ndoes issue with respect to a former service member, the Government\nmaintains it would lack jurisdiction to retry. Tr. of Oral Arg. 56–57;\nsee 10 U. S. C. §§802–803. Avoiding that extraordinary result would\nrequire another “belated extension” of the original court-martial pro\nceeding, expanding the jurisdiction of military courts to try individuals\nwho have long since severed their ties to the military.\n8                UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nrecord).\n   To be sure, the limited nature of relief available under\nArticle 73 might lead one to question whether that is truly\nthe only postconviction relief the UCMJ permits. “You’re\nin the Army now” is a sufficient answer to such concerns;\nthe relief available looks positively extravagant in light of\nthe prior history and tradition of military justice. In any\nevent, as the majority recognizes, see ante, at 11, Article\n76 makes clear that all court-martial judgments “carried\ninto execution” after completion of direct review are “final\nand conclusive,” 10 U. S. C. §876. Contrary to the major\nity’s assertion, that language does not simply “codif[y] the\ncommon-law rule that respects the finality of judgments.”\nAnte, at 11. In fact, Article 76 does not stop there. It goes\non to instruct that final court-martial judgments are\nbinding “subject only to action upon a petition for a new\ntrial [under Article 73],” or action by the appropriate\nSecretary or the President. 10 U. S. C. §876 (emphasis\nadded).\n   In light of these provisions, only Article 73 provides any\nauthority to the CCAs or the CAAF, and even that narrow\nauthority is limited to pending cases. Once a conviction is\nfinal, only the judge advocate general can provide relief.\nSee supra, at 3; 10 U. S. C. §873. To the extent the CCAs\nor the CAAF could be deemed to have some inherent\ncontinuing authority to issue writs of coram nobis, Articles\n73 and 76 extinguish it.\n                              IV\n  The Government goes on to argue that even if military\ncourts have jurisdiction to issue writs of coram nobis, and\neven if Articles 73 and 76 do not bar such relief, the courts\nstill lack authority to issue coram nobis, because the writ\nis neither “necessary” nor “appropriate” to the court\nmartial system of justice. See 28 U. S. C. §1651(a) (federal\ncourts “may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof their respective jurisdictions”). Coram nobis allows the\ncourt that issued a judgment to correct its own errors of\nfact. See Morgan, 346 U. S., at 507, n. 9 (“ ‘If a judgment\nin the King’s Bench be erroneous in matter of fact only, . . .\nit may be reversed in the same court, by writ of error\ncoram nobis’ ” (quoting 2 W. Tidd, Practice of the Courts of\nKing’s Bench, and Common Pleas 1136 (4th Am. ed. 1856);\nsome emphasis added)); see also ante, at 11 (referring to\n“authority of a court to protect the integrity of its earlier\njudgments” (emphasis added)). But a court-martial is not\na standing court. On a case-by-case basis, “[i]t is called\ninto existence for a special purpose and to perform a par\nticular duty. When the object of its creation has been\naccomplished it is dissolved.” Runkle v. United States, 122\nU. S. 543, 555–556 (1887); see also 66 M. J. 114, 124\n(CAAF 2008) (a court-martial “does not have independent\njurisdiction over a case after the military judge authenti\ncates the record and the convening authority forwards the\nrecord after taking action”). Because the court-martial\nthat issues the conviction no longer exists once the convic\ntion is final, there is no court to which a postconviction\npetition for coram nobis could be directed.\n   The absence of standing courts-martial is no mere tech\nnicality, but rather an integral and intentional part of the\nmilitary justice system. “Court-martial jurisdiction sprang\nfrom the belief that within the military ranks there is need\nfor a prompt, ready-at-hand means of compelling obedience\nand order.” United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S.\n11, 22 (1955). But meeting that need requires expending\nsignificant military resources, and “[t]o the extent that\nthose responsible for performance of [the military’s] pri\nmary function are diverted from it by the necessity of\ntrying cases, the basic fighting purpose of armies is not\nserved.” Id., at 17. Accordingly, courts-martial, composed\nof active duty military personnel, have always been called\ninto existence for a limited purpose and duration.\n10               UNITED STATES v. DENEDO\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   It is no answer that the CCAs and the CAAF are stand\ning courts that could act as substitutes for coram nobis\npurposes. As this case illustrates, those courts are not\nequipped to handle the kind of factfinding necessary to\nresolve claims that might be brought on coram nobis.\nInstead, the CCAs will have to resort to the procedures\ninvented by United States v. DuBay, 17 U. S. C. M. A. 147,\n37 C. M. R. 411 (1967), under which a new convening\nauthority will refer a case to a new court-martial, and task\nvarious military personnel who have no prior familiarity\nwith the case to conduct an out-of-court evidentiary hear\ning on the merits of the petitioner’s claim. Id., at 149, 37\nC. M. R., at 413. This “unwieldy and imperfect system”\nwill undoubtedly divert valuable military resources, 66\nM. J., at 136 (Ryan, J., dissenting), all in aid of postconvic\ntion relief Congress specifically withheld.\n   The Court expressly declines to consider the Govern\nment’s “necessary or appropriate” argument: “[T]he Gov\nernment’s argument speaks to the scope of the writ, not\nthe [CCA’s] jurisdiction to issue it. The CAAF rejected the\nformer argument. Only the latter one is before us.” Ante,\nat 12. The Court may well be correct in dividing the ques\ntions into separate pigeonholes. But the Government’s\nargument, even if an argument about authority rather\nthan jurisdiction, applies to every coram nobis case, given\nthe nature of the military justice system. It is curious to\nconclude that military courts have jurisdiction, while not\nconsidering a raised and briefed argument that they may\nnever exercise it.\n                       *     *     *\n   Since the adoption of the UCMJ, “Congress has gradu\nally changed the system of military justice so that it has\ncome to more closely resemble the civilian system.” Weiss\nv. United States, 510 U. S. 163, 174 (1994). “But the mili\ntary in important respects remains a specialized society\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nseparate from civilian society.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Neither the jurisdiction nor the powers of\nArticle III courts are necessarily appropriate for military\ncourts, and Congress’s contrary determinations in this\narea are entitled to “the highest deference.” Loving v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 748, 768 (1996). Rather than\nrespect the rule that military courts have no jurisdiction to\nrevisit final convictions, the majority creates an exception\nthat swallows it. Because I would hold the military courts\nto the statutory restraints that govern them, I respectfully\ndissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145866/", "sha1": "16333aabf22e9e1545bf5743d952a0b8586c4b45", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-065", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:44"}
