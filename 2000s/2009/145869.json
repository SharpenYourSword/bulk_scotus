Decided June 1, 2009\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat.\n65, as amended, provides that employees of common\ncarrier railroads may recover for work-related injuries\ncaused in whole or in part by their railroad-employer’s\nnegligence. See 45 U. S. C. §§51–60. In this case respon\ndent Thurston Hensley sued petitioner CSX Transporta\ntion, Inc., in Tennessee state court. Hensley, who was\nemployed by CSX as an electrician, alleged that the rail\nroad negligently caused him to contract asbestosis—a\nnoncancerous scarring of lung tissue caused by long-term\nexposure to asbestos.\n   Hensley sought pain-and-suffering damages from CSX\nbased on, among other things, his fear of developing lung\ncancer in the future. The Court addressed this subject in\nNorfolk & Western R. Co. v. Ayers, 538 U. S. 135 (2003),\nand held that those types of damages are available in\ncertain FELA cases. The Court stated:\n    “Norfolk presented the question whether a plaintiff\n    who has asbestosis but not cancer can recover dam\n    ages for fear of cancer under the FELA without proof\n    of physical manifestations of the claimed emotional\n    distress.

CSX\nproposed two instructions—requests 30 and 33—related to\nHensley’s claim for fear-of-cancer damages. Request 30\nstated the basic requirements to obtain those damages\nunder Ayers. Supp. Tech. Record, Exh. A, p. 4 (“Plaintiff is\nalso alleging that he suffers from a compensable fear of\ncancer. In order to recover, Plaintiff must demonstrate . . .\nthat the . . . fear is genuine and serious”). Request 33\nstated certain factors the jury could consider in applying\nthe Ayers standard. Id., at 5–6. The trial court denied\nboth requests over CSX’s objections, and the jury was not\ninstructed as to the legal standard for fear-of-cancer dam\nages. 17 Tr. 2410–2415; 20 id., at 2903–2904. After two\nhours of deliberations, the jury found for Hensley and\nawarded him $5 million in damages.\n   The Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed. 278 S. W. 3d\n282 (2008). It described our opinion in Ayers as “specifi\ncally limit[ed]” to the “narrow issue” of whether a FELA\nplaintiff with asbestosis can recover for fear of cancer. 278\nS. W. 3d, at 300. According to the Tennessee Court of\nAppeals, Ayers “did not discuss or authorize jury instruc\ntions on this issue, but merely ruled on substantive law.”\n278 S. W. 3d, at 300 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe Tennessee Court of Appeals also reasoned that “little\nif any purpose would be served by instructing the jury that\nthe plaintiff’s fear must be ‘genuine and serious.’ ” Ibid.\nThat is because “the mere suggestion of the possibility of\ncancer has the potential to evoke raw emotions,” and\n“[a]ny juror who might be predisposed to grant a large\naward based on shaky evidence of a fear of cancer is\nunlikely to be swayed by the language of Ayers.” Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nInstead, the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, “it is for\nthe courts to serve as gatekeepers” by ensuring that fear\nof-cancer claims “do not go to the jury unless there is\ncredible evidence of a ‘genuine and serious’ fear.” Ibid.\n   CSX petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Tennes\nsee Court of Appeals misread and misapplied this Court’s\ndecision in Ayers. CSX’s contention is correct. The ruling\nof the Tennessee Court of Appeals, and the refusal of the\ntrial court to give an instruction, were clear error. Con\ntrary to the assertion of the Tennessee Court of Appeals,\nthe Ayers Court expressly recognized that several “verdict\ncontrol devices [are] available to the trial court” when a\nFELA plaintiff seeks fear-of-cancer damages. 538 U. S., at\n159, n. 19. Those “include, on a defendant’s request, a\ncharge that each plaintiff must prove any alleged fear to\nbe genuine and serious.” Ibid. CSX requested an instruc\ntion on the substance of the genuine-and-serious standard,\nand the trial court erred by not giving one.\n   The reasons given by the Tennessee Court of Appeals for\nupholding the denial of an instruction on the standard do\nnot withstand scrutiny. The court stated that instructing\nthe jury on the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages\nwould have been futile because cancer touches many lives\nand therefore “evoke[s] [jurors’] raw emotions.” 278 S. W.\n3d, at 300. This is a serious misunderstanding of the\nnature and function of the jury. The jury system is prem\nised on the idea that rationality and careful regard for the\ncourt’s instructions will confine and exclude jurors’ raw\nemotions. Jurors routinely serve as impartial factfinders\nin cases that involve sensitive, even life-and-death mat\nters. In those cases, as in all cases, juries are presumed to\nfollow the court’s instructions. See Greer v. Miller, 483\nU. S. 756, 766, n. 8 (1987). And the trial court in this case\ncorrectly instructed the jury as to its legal duty to “follow\nall of the instructions.” 20 Tr. 2882.\n   Instructing the jury on the standard for fear-of-cancer\n4               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. HENSLEY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndamages would not have been futile. To the contrary, the\nfact that cancer claims could “evoke raw emotions” is a\npowerful reason to instruct the jury on the proper legal\nstandard. Giving the instruction on this point is particu\nlarly important in the FELA context. That is because of\nthe volume of pending asbestos claims and also because\nthe nature of those claims enhances the danger that a\njury, without proper instructions, could award emotional\ndistress damages based on slight evidence of a plaintiff’s\nfear of contracting cancer. But as this Court said in Ayers,\nmore is required. Although plaintiffs can seek fear-of\ncancer damages in some FELA cases, they must satisfy a\nhigh standard in order to obtain them. 538 U. S., at 157–\n158, and n. 17. Refusing defendants’ requests to instruct\nthe jury as to that high standard would render it all but\nmeaningless.\n   It is no answer that, as the Tennessee Court of Appeals\nstated, courts can apply the Ayers standard when ruling\non sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges. To be sure,\nAyers recognized that a “review of the evidence on dam\nages for sufficiency” is another of the “verdict control\ndevices” available to courts when plaintiffs seek fear-of\ncancer damages. Id., at 159, n. 19. But a determination\nthat there is sufficient evidence to send a claim to a jury is\nnot the same as a determination that a plaintiff has met\nthe burden of proof and should succeed on a claim out\nright. Put another way, a properly instructed jury could\nfind that a plaintiff’s fear is not “genuine and serious”\neven when there is legally sufficient evidence for the jury\nto rule for the plaintiff on the issue. That is why Ayers\nrecognized that sufficiency reviews and jury instructions\nare important and separate protections against imposing\nunbounded liability on asbestos defendants in fear-of\ncancer claims.\n   When this Court in Ayers held that certain FELA plain\ntiffs can recover based on their fear of developing cancer, it\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nstruck a delicate balance between plaintiffs and defen\ndants—and it did so against the backdrop of systemic\ndifficulties posed by the “elephantine mass of asbestos\ncases.” Id., at 166 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nJury instructions stating the proper standard for fear-of\ncancer damages were part of that balance, id., at 159,\nn. 19, and courts must give such instructions upon a de\nfendant’s request. The ruling of the Tennessee Court of\nAppeals conflicts with Ayers. The trial court should have\ngiven the substance of the requested instructions. See\nalso Hedgecorth v. Union Pacific R. Co., 210 S. W. 3d 220,\n227–229 (Mo. App. 2006) (same).\n  The petition for certiorari is granted.

The judgment\nof the Tennessee Court of Appeals is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

THURSTON \n\n                   HENSLEY\n\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF\n\n       APPEALS OF TENNESSEE, EASTERN DIVISION\n\n                 No. 08–1034. Decided June 1, 2009\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.\n   During his 33 years of employment at L&N Railroad\n(now CSX Transportation, Inc., or CSX), respondent\nThurston Hensley was regularly exposed to a solvent that\neventually caused toxic encephalopathy, an incurable and\npermanent form of brain damage that ended his ability to\nwork. He was also exposed to asbestos that gave rise to a\nchronic pulmonary condition known as asbestosis. As we\nhave previously noted, asbestosis sufferers “have a signifi\ncant (one in ten) risk of dying of mesothelioma, a fatal\ncancer of the lining of the lung or abdominal cavity.”\nNorfolk & Western R. Co. v. Ayers, 538 U. S. 135, 142\n(2003).\n   In addition to claiming damages for the economic inju\nries caused by those two diseases, Hensley sought dam\nages for his fear of developing cancer in the future. At\ntrial, CSX requested two jury instructions on this fear-of\ncancer claim: The first stated that Hensley had the burden\nof proving “that [his] fear is genuine and serious,” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 70a; the second illustrated ways in which\nHensley could prove that his fear was genuine and seri\nous.1 The trial court rejected both instructions and in\n——————\n  1 CSX’s second proposed charge (request 33) would have instructed\n\nthe jury: “In determining whether the Plaintiff has suffered emotional\ndistress resulting from any reasonable fear of developing cancer as a\nresult of his diagnosis of asbestosis, you must determine whether he\nhas demonstrated that his fear is genuine and serious. . . . In making\nthis determination, you may take into account whether or not the\n2                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. HENSLEY\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nstead charged the jury in accordance with Tennessee’s\nPattern Jury Instructions for pain and suffering. See App.\nto Brief in Opposition 14; id., at 19.\n  The jury unanimously found CSX liable for negligently\ncausing Hensley’s brain damage and asbestosis, see App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 58a, and awarded him $5,000,000 in\ncompensatory damages—an award CSX has never chal\nlenged as excessive. App. to Brief in Opposition 23. Be\ncause CSX did not request a special verdict or special\ninterrogatory, we do not know what portion (if any) of the\naward was meant to compensate Hensley for his fear of\ndeveloping cancer.\n  This Court’s decision to nullify the jury’s damages\naward rests on the premise that footnote 19 in our opinion\nin Ayers created a rule that requires trial judges, on a\ndefendant’s demand, to instruct the jury that any fear-of\ncancer claim must be genuine and serious to be com\npensable. The footnote at issue states:\n     “In their prediction that adhering to the line drawn in\n     Gottshall and Metro-North will, in this setting, bank\n     rupt defendants, the dissents largely disregard, inter\n     alia, the verdict control devices available to the trial\n     court. These include, on a defendant’s request, a\n     charge that each plaintiff must prove any alleged fear\n     to be genuine and serious, review of the evidence on\n     damages for sufficiency, and particularized verdict\n——————\nPlaintiff has voiced more than a general concern about his future\nhealth, whether or not he has suffered from insomnia or other stress\nrelated conditions, whether or not he has sought psychiatric or medical\nattention for his symptoms, whether he has consulted counselors or\nministers concerning his fear, whether he has demonstrated any\nphysical symptoms as a result of his fear, and whether he has produced\nwitnesses who can corroborate his fear.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a–71a;\nsee also Hedgecorth v. Union Pacific R. Co., 210 S. W. 3d 220, 227 (Mo.\nCt. App. 2006) (noting an identical instruction requested by Union\nPacific Railroad).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n    forms.” 538 U. S., at 159, n. 19 (citations omitted).\nNaturally read, this footnote merely points out that a\ndefendant has the right to request a genuine-and-serious\ninstruction and that, if requested, such an instruction is\navailable to the trial court. It does not suggest that all\nrequests must be granted. And it certainly does not indi\ncate that a court’s decision not to give the instruction\nwould be treated as per se reversible error. That was my\nview of footnote 19 when I joined the Ayers majority.\n   Since Ayers, two state appellate courts—the Tennessee\nCourt of Appeals in this case and the Missouri Court of\nAppeals in Hedgecorth v. Union Pacific R. Co., 210 S. W.\n3d 220 (2006), cert. denied, 552 U. S. ___ (2007)—have\nread footnote 19 as I do. These courts have understood\nthat the primary duty of the trial court is to serve as a\ngatekeeper, refusing to allow the jury to award fear-of\ncancer damages absent evidence that the fear was genuine\nand serious. Both courts affirmed decisions to reject genu\nine-and-serious instructions and to rely instead on general\npain-and-suffering instructions to charge the jury. In so\ndoing, they rightly noted that Ayers focused on whether\nfear-of-cancer claims were cognizable under the Federal\nEmployers’ Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. §§51–60, and\nthat it “did not discuss or authorize jury instructions.”\nHedgecorth, 210 S. W. 3d, at 229; see 278 S. W. 3d 282,\n330 (Tenn. App. 2008) (case below).\n   These courts have read Ayers correctly. Immediately\nafter the disputed statement in footnote 19, we made clear\nthat we were passing, “specifically and only, on the ques\ntion whether this case should be aligned with those in\nwhich fear of future injury stems from a current injury, or\nwith those presenting a stand-alone claim for negligent\ninfliction of emotional distress.” 538 U. S., at 159. In\nsiding with the former option, we consulted and followed\nthe common-law view that “pain and suffering damages\n4               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. HENSLEY\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmay include compensation for fear of cancer when that\nfear accompanies a physical injury.” Id., at 148 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We had no occasion to, and\ntherefore did not, offer a federal common-law rule that\nwould displace the various pain-and-suffering instructions\nroutinely given to juries. In fact, we specifically took issue\nwith the “the dissents’ readiness to ‘develop a federal\ncommon law’ to contain jury verdicts under the FELA.”\nId., at 158, n. 17. Yet, inexplicably, the Court today reads\nAyers—in dicta no less—to have done precisely what it\ncriticized.\n   In its rush to reverse the Tennessee Court of Appeals,\nthe Court issues a mandate that is bound to invite further\nquestions. For instance, if it is per se error for the trial\ncourt to deny a request for a genuine-and-serious instruc\ntion, is it also per se error to fail to employ particularized\nverdict forms? After all, that too is a verdict control device\nlisted in footnote 19. Id., at 159, n. 19. How much discre\ntion, if any, is accorded the trial court to decide which\ndevices are necessary? Is the list of verdict-control devices\nidentified in Ayers exhaustive? The risk that the Court’s\nopinion will generate more confusion than clarity is inher\nent in a summary decisional process that does not give the\nparties an opportunity to brief and argue the merits.\n   A $5,000,000 verdict may well justify careful review of\nall claims of error. But the Court’s foray into error correc\ntion is not compelled by Ayers. A proper reading of Ayers\nand an appropriate amount of respect for the jury in this\ncase should have counseled the Court to stay its hand.\nInstead, it authorizes a fresh review of the jury’s damages\naward in response to the possibility that the jury decided\nto compensate Hensley for his fear of cancer without con\ncluding that his fear was genuine and serious. Yet, as a\npractical matter, it is hard to believe the jury would have\nawarded any damages for Hensley’s fear of cancer if it did\nnot believe that fear to be genuine and serious. The trial\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncourt instructed the jury that while Hensley had “no obli\ngation to prove with mathematical certainty such intangi\nble things as pain and suffering or loss of enjoyment of\nlife,” he did have to prove “that a loss has, indeed, oc\ncurred.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a. This is an unwise\nsummary disposition.2\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  2 Although the Court concludes that the trial court erred by not giving\n\na genuine-and-serious charge, the question whether the instructional\nerror was nevertheless harmless remains open to review on remand by\nthe Tennessee Court of Appeals.

S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nInstead, the Tennessee Court of Appeals stated, “it is for\nthe courts to serve as gatekeepers” by ensuring that fear\nof-cancer claims “do not go to the jury unless there is\ncredible evidence of a ‘genuine and serious’ fear.” Ibid.\n   CSX petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Tennes\nsee Court of Appeals misread and misapplied this Court’s\ndecision in Ayers. CSX’s contention is correct. The ruling\nof the Tennessee Court of Appeals, and the refusal of the\ntrial court to give an instruction, were clear error. Con\ntrary to the assertion of the Tennessee Court of Appeals,\nthe Ayers Court expressly recognized that several “verdict\ncontrol devices [are] available to the trial court” when a\nFELA plaintiff seeks fear-of-cancer damages. 538 U. S., at\n159, n. 19. Those “include, on a defendant’s request, a\ncharge that each plaintiff must prove any alleged fear to\nbe genuine and serious.” Ibid. CSX requested an instruc\ntion on the substance of the genuine-and-serious standard,\nand the trial court erred by not giving one.\n   The reasons given by the Tennessee Court of Appeals for\nupholding the denial of an instruction on the standard do\nnot withstand scrutiny. The court stated that instructing\nthe jury on the legal standard for fear-of-cancer damages\nwould have been futile because cancer touches many lives\nand therefore “evoke[s] [jurors’] raw emotions.” 278 S. W.\n3d, at 300. This is a serious misunderstanding of the\nnature and function of the jury. The jury system is prem\nised on the idea that rationality and careful regard for the\ncourt’s instructions will confine and exclude jurors’ raw\nemotions. Jurors routinely serve as impartial factfinders\nin cases that involve sensitive, even life-and-death mat\nters. In those cases, as in all cases, juries are presumed to\nfollow the court’s instructions. See Greer v. Miller, 483\nU. S. 756, 766, n. 8 (1987). And the trial court in this case\ncorrectly instructed the jury as to its legal duty to “follow\nall of the instructions.” 20 Tr. 2882.\n   Instructing the jury on the standard for fear-of-cancer\n4               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. HENSLEY\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ndamages would not have been futile. To the contrary, the\nfact that cancer claims could “evoke raw emotions” is a\npowerful reason to instruct the jury on the proper legal\nstandard. Giving the instruction on this point is particu\nlarly important in the FELA context. That is because of\nthe volume of pending asbestos claims and also because\nthe nature of those claims enhances the danger that a\njury, without proper instructions, could award emotional\ndistress damages based on slight evidence of a plaintiff’s\nfear of contracting cancer. But as this Court said in Ayers,\nmore is required. Although plaintiffs can seek fear-of\ncancer damages in some FELA cases, they must satisfy a\nhigh standard in order to obtain them. 538 U. S., at 157–\n158, and n. 17. Refusing defendants’ requests to instruct\nthe jury as to that high standard would render it all but\nmeaningless.\n   It is no answer that, as the Tennessee Court of Appeals\nstated, courts can apply the Ayers standard when ruling\non sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges. To be sure,\nAyers recognized that a “review of the evidence on dam\nages for sufficiency” is another of the “verdict control\ndevices” available to courts when plaintiffs seek fear-of\ncancer damages. Id., at 159, n. 19. But a determination\nthat there is sufficient evidence to send a claim to a jury is\nnot the same as a determination that a plaintiff has met\nthe burden of proof and should succeed on a claim out\nright. Put another way, a properly instructed jury could\nfind that a plaintiff’s fear is not “genuine and serious”\neven when there is legally sufficient evidence for the jury\nto rule for the plaintiff on the issue. That is why Ayers\nrecognized that sufficiency reviews and jury instructions\nare important and separate protections against imposing\nunbounded liability on asbestos defendants in fear-of\ncancer claims.\n   When this Court in Ayers held that certain FELA plain\ntiffs can recover based on their fear of developing cancer, it\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nstruck a delicate balance between plaintiffs and defen\ndants—and it did so against the backdrop of systemic\ndifficulties posed by the “elephantine mass of asbestos\ncases.” Id., at 166 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nJury instructions stating the proper standard for fear-of\ncancer damages were part of that balance, id., at 159,\nn. 19, and courts must give such instructions upon a de\nfendant’s request. The ruling of the Tennessee Court of\nAppeals conflicts with Ayers. The trial court should have\ngiven the substance of the requested instructions. See\nalso Hedgecorth v. Union Pacific R. Co., 210 S. W. 3d 220,\n227–229 (Mo. App. 2006) (same).\n  The petition for certiorari is granted.

THURSTON \n\n                   HENSLEY\n\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF\n\n       APPEALS OF TENNESSEE, EASTERN DIVISION\n\n                 No. 08–1034. Decided June 1, 2009\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.\n   During his 33 years of employment at L&N Railroad\n(now CSX Transportation, Inc., or CSX), respondent\nThurston Hensley was regularly exposed to a solvent that\neventually caused toxic encephalopathy, an incurable and\npermanent form of brain damage that ended his ability to\nwork. He was also exposed to asbestos that gave rise to a\nchronic pulmonary condition known as asbestosis. As we\nhave previously noted, asbestosis sufferers “have a signifi\ncant (one in ten) risk of dying of mesothelioma, a fatal\ncancer of the lining of the lung or abdominal cavity.”\nNorfolk & Western R. Co. v. Ayers, 538 U. S. 135, 142\n(2003).\n   In addition to claiming damages for the economic inju\nries caused by those two diseases, Hensley sought dam\nages for his fear of developing cancer in the future. At\ntrial, CSX requested two jury instructions on this fear-of\ncancer claim: The first stated that Hensley had the burden\nof proving “that [his] fear is genuine and serious,” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 70a; the second illustrated ways in which\nHensley could prove that his fear was genuine and seri\nous.1 The trial court rejected both instructions and in\n——————\n  1 CSX’s second proposed charge (request 33) would have instructed\n\nthe jury: “In determining whether the Plaintiff has suffered emotional\ndistress resulting from any reasonable fear of developing cancer as a\nresult of his diagnosis of asbestosis, you must determine whether he\nhas demonstrated that his fear is genuine and serious. . . . In making\nthis determination, you may take into account whether or not the\n2                 CSX TRANSP., INC. v. HENSLEY\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nstead charged the jury in accordance with Tennessee’s\nPattern Jury Instructions for pain and suffering. See App.\nto Brief in Opposition 14; id., at 19.\n  The jury unanimously found CSX liable for negligently\ncausing Hensley’s brain damage and asbestosis, see App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 58a, and awarded him $5,000,000 in\ncompensatory damages—an award CSX has never chal\nlenged as excessive. App. to Brief in Opposition 23. Be\ncause CSX did not request a special verdict or special\ninterrogatory, we do not know what portion (if any) of the\naward was meant to compensate Hensley for his fear of\ndeveloping cancer.\n  This Court’s decision to nullify the jury’s damages\naward rests on the premise that footnote 19 in our opinion\nin Ayers created a rule that requires trial judges, on a\ndefendant’s demand, to instruct the jury that any fear-of\ncancer claim must be genuine and serious to be com\npensable. The footnote at issue states:\n     “In their prediction that adhering to the line drawn in\n     Gottshall and Metro-North will, in this setting, bank\n     rupt defendants, the dissents largely disregard, inter\n     alia, the verdict control devices available to the trial\n     court. These include, on a defendant’s request, a\n     charge that each plaintiff must prove any alleged fear\n     to be genuine and serious, review of the evidence on\n     damages for sufficiency, and particularized verdict\n——————\nPlaintiff has voiced more than a general concern about his future\nhealth, whether or not he has suffered from insomnia or other stress\nrelated conditions, whether or not he has sought psychiatric or medical\nattention for his symptoms, whether he has consulted counselors or\nministers concerning his fear, whether he has demonstrated any\nphysical symptoms as a result of his fear, and whether he has produced\nwitnesses who can corroborate his fear.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a–71a;\nsee also Hedgecorth v. Union Pacific R. Co., 210 S. W. 3d 220, 227 (Mo.\nCt. App. 2006) (noting an identical instruction requested by Union\nPacific Railroad).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n    forms.” 538 U. S., at 159, n. 19 (citations omitted).\nNaturally read, this footnote merely points out that a\ndefendant has the right to request a genuine-and-serious\ninstruction and that, if requested, such an instruction is\navailable to the trial court. It does not suggest that all\nrequests must be granted. And it certainly does not indi\ncate that a court’s decision not to give the instruction\nwould be treated as per se reversible error. That was my\nview of footnote 19 when I joined the Ayers majority.\n   Since Ayers, two state appellate courts—the Tennessee\nCourt of Appeals in this case and the Missouri Court of\nAppeals in Hedgecorth v. Union Pacific R. Co., 210 S. W.\n3d 220 (2006), cert. denied, 552 U. S. ___ (2007)—have\nread footnote 19 as I do. These courts have understood\nthat the primary duty of the trial court is to serve as a\ngatekeeper, refusing to allow the jury to award fear-of\ncancer damages absent evidence that the fear was genuine\nand serious. Both courts affirmed decisions to reject genu\nine-and-serious instructions and to rely instead on general\npain-and-suffering instructions to charge the jury. In so\ndoing, they rightly noted that Ayers focused on whether\nfear-of-cancer claims were cognizable under the Federal\nEmployers’ Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. §§51–60, and\nthat it “did not discuss or authorize jury instructions.”\nHedgecorth, 210 S. W. 3d, at 229; see 278 S. W. 3d 282,\n330 (Tenn. App. 2008) (case below).\n   These courts have read Ayers correctly. Immediately\nafter the disputed statement in footnote 19, we made clear\nthat we were passing, “specifically and only, on the ques\ntion whether this case should be aligned with those in\nwhich fear of future injury stems from a current injury, or\nwith those presenting a stand-alone claim for negligent\ninfliction of emotional distress.” 538 U. S., at 159. In\nsiding with the former option, we consulted and followed\nthe common-law view that “pain and suffering damages\n4               CSX TRANSP., INC. v. HENSLEY\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmay include compensation for fear of cancer when that\nfear accompanies a physical injury.” Id., at 148 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We had no occasion to, and\ntherefore did not, offer a federal common-law rule that\nwould displace the various pain-and-suffering instructions\nroutinely given to juries. In fact, we specifically took issue\nwith the “the dissents’ readiness to ‘develop a federal\ncommon law’ to contain jury verdicts under the FELA.”\nId., at 158, n. 17. Yet, inexplicably, the Court today reads\nAyers—in dicta no less—to have done precisely what it\ncriticized.\n   In its rush to reverse the Tennessee Court of Appeals,\nthe Court issues a mandate that is bound to invite further\nquestions. For instance, if it is per se error for the trial\ncourt to deny a request for a genuine-and-serious instruc\ntion, is it also per se error to fail to employ particularized\nverdict forms? After all, that too is a verdict control device\nlisted in footnote 19. Id., at 159, n. 19. How much discre\ntion, if any, is accorded the trial court to decide which\ndevices are necessary? Is the list of verdict-control devices\nidentified in Ayers exhaustive? The risk that the Court’s\nopinion will generate more confusion than clarity is inher\nent in a summary decisional process that does not give the\nparties an opportunity to brief and argue the merits.\n   A $5,000,000 verdict may well justify careful review of\nall claims of error. But the Court’s foray into error correc\ntion is not compelled by Ayers. A proper reading of Ayers\nand an appropriate amount of respect for the jury in this\ncase should have counseled the Court to stay its hand.\nInstead, it authorizes a fresh review of the jury’s damages\naward in response to the possibility that the jury decided\nto compensate Hensley for his fear of cancer without con\ncluding that his fear was genuine and serious. Yet, as a\npractical matter, it is hard to believe the jury would have\nawarded any damages for Hensley’s fear of cancer if it did\nnot believe that fear to be genuine and serious. The trial\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncourt instructed the jury that while Hensley had “no obli\ngation to prove with mathematical certainty such intangi\nble things as pain and suffering or loss of enjoyment of\nlife,” he did have to prove “that a loss has, indeed, oc\ncurred.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a. This is an unwise\nsummary disposition.2\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  2 Although the Court concludes that the trial court erred by not giving\n\na genuine-and-serious charge, the question whether the instructional\nerror was nevertheless harmless remains open to review on remand by\nthe Tennessee Court of Appeals.
