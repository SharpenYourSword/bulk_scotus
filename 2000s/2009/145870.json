BIES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u2013598.      Argued April 27, 2009\u2014Decided June 1, 2009\nIn Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, this Court held that the Eighth\n  Amendment bars execution of mentally retarded offenders. Prior to\n  Atkins, mental retardation merited consideration as a mitigating fac\n  tor, but did not bar imposition of the death penalty. See Penry v. Ly\n  naugh, 492 U. S. 302. Nearly a decade before Atkins, respondent\n  Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kid\n  naping, and attempted rape of a ten-year-old boy. Instructed at the\n  sentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (including evi\n  dence of Bies\u2019 mild to borderline mental retardation) against aggra\n  vating factors (including the crime\u2019s brutality), the jury recommended\n  a death sentence, which the trial court imposed. Ohio\u2019s Court of Ap\n  peals and Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, each\n  concluding that Bies\u2019 mental retardation was entitled to \u201csome\n  weight\u201d as a mitigating factor, but that the aggravating circum\n  stances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Bies then filed an\n  unsuccessful petition for state postconviction relief, contending for\n  the first time that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of a\n  mentally retarded defendant. Soon after Bies sought federal habeas\n  relief, this Court decided Atkins. The opinion left to the States the\n  task of developing appropriate ways to determine when a person\n  claiming mental retardation would fall within Atkins\u2019 compass. Ohio\n  heeded Atkins\u2019 call in State v. Lott. The District Court then stayed\n  Bies\u2019 federal habeas proceedings so that he could present an Atkins\n  claim to the state postconviction court. Observing that Bies\u2019 mental\n  retardation had not previously been established under the Atkins-\n  Lott framework, the state court denied Bies\u2019 motion for summary\n  judgment and ordered a full hearing on the Atkins claim. Rather\n  than proceeding with that hearing, Bies returned to federal court, ar\n2                             BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    guing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from reliti\n    gating the mental retardation issue. The District Court granted the\n    habeas petition, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Relying on Ashe v.\n    Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, the Court of Appeals determined that all re\n    quirements for the issue preclusion component of the Double Jeop\n    ardy Clause were met in Bies\u2019 case. It concluded, inter alia, that the\n    Ohio Supreme Court, on direct appeal, had decided the mental retar\n    dation issue under the same standard that court later adopted in\n    Lott, and that the state court\u2019s recognition of Bies\u2019 mental state had\n    been necessary to the death penalty judgment. When the Sixth Cir\n    cuit denied the State\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, a concurring\n    judge offered an alternative basis for decision. He opined that, under\n    Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, jeopardy attaches once a\n    capital defendant is \u201cacquitted\u201d based on findings establishing an en\n    titlement to a life sentence; reasoning that the Ohio courts\u2019 mental\n    retardation findings entitled Bies to a life sentence, he concluded that\n    the Double Jeopardy Clause barred any renewed inquiry into Bies\u2019\n    mental state.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the Ohio courts from\n conducting a full hearing on Bies\u2019 mental capacity. Pp. 7\u201311.\n    (a) The alternative basis for decision offered by the concurring\n opinion at the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rehearing stage is rejected. The State\n did not \u201ctwice put [Bies] in jeopardy,\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, in the\n core constitutional sense. Sattazahn offers Bies no aid, for there was\n no acquittal here. Bies\u2019 jury voted to impose the death penalty. At\n issue is his attempt to vacate that sentence, not an effort by the State\n to retry him or to increase his punishment. Nor did the state courts\u2019\n mental retardation determinations entitle Bies to a life sentence. At\n the time of his sentencing and direct appeal, Penry, not Atkins, was\n the guiding decision, and the dispositive issue was whether the miti\n gating factors were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances be\n yond a reasonable doubt. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) The issue preclusion doctrine, on which the Sixth Circuit panel\n primarily relied, does not bar a full airing of the issue whether Bies\n qualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins and Lott. The doctrine\n bars relitigation of issues actually determined and necessary to the\n ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding. Initially, it is not clear that\n the issue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation was actually determined under\n the Lott test at trial or on direct appeal. Nor did the State concede\n that Bies would succeed under Atkins and Lott, which had not then\n been decided. More fundamental, it is clear that the state courts\u2019\n statements regarding Bies\u2019 mental capacity were not necessary to the\n judgments affirming his death sentence. Instead, those determina\n tions cut against the ultimate outcome. In holding otherwise, the\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Sixth Circuit conflated a determination necessary to the bottom-line\n  judgment with a subsidiary finding that, standing alone, is not out\n  come determinative. The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on Ashe\u2019s\n  statement: \u201c[W]hen an issue of ultimate fact has once been deter\n  mined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be liti\n  gated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d 397 U. S., at\n  443. Bies\u2019 case does not involve the kind of \u201cultimate fact\u201d addressed\n  in Ashe. There, the State was precluded from trying Ashe for robbing\n  a poker player because he had already been acquitted of robbing a\n  different player in the same poker game, and the acquittal was based\n  on a determination that Ashe was not a participant in the poker\n  game robbery. Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted, and determina\n  tions of his mental capacity were not necessary to the ultimate impo\n  sition of the death penalty. Moreover, even if the core issue preclu\n  sion requirements had been met, an exception to the doctrine\u2019s\n  application would be warranted due to the intervening Atkins deci\n  sion. Mental retardation as a mitigator and mental retardation un\n  der Atkins and Lott are discrete legal issues. One difference is that\n  mental retardation, urged as a mitigating factor, may instead \u201cen\n  hance the likelihood that [a jury will find] the aggravating factor of\n  future dangerousness.\u201d Atkins 536 U. S., at 521. This reality ex\n  plains why prosecutors, pre-Atkins, had little incentive to contest re\n  tardation evidence. Because the change in law substantially altered\n  the State\u2019s incentive to contest Bies\u2019 mental capacity, applying pre\n  clusion would not advance the equitable administration of the law.\n  The federal courts\u2019 intervention in this case derailed the state-court\n  proceeding. Recourse first to Ohio\u2019s courts is what this Court envi\n  sioned in remitting to the States responsibility for implementing At\n  kins. The State acknowledges that Bies is entitled to such recourse,\n  but rightly seeks a full and fair opportunity to contest his plea under\n  the Atkins and Lott precedents.

Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), this Court\nheld that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u201ccruel\nand unusual punishments\u201d bars execution of mentally\nretarded offenders. Prior to Atkins, the Court had deter\nmined that mental retardation merited consideration as a\nmitigating factor, but did not bar imposition of the death\npenalty. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989).\n   In 1992, nearly a decade before the Court\u2019s decision in\nAtkins, respondent Michael Bies was tried and convicted\nin Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnaping, and at\ntempted rape of a ten-year-old boy. Instructed at the\nsentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (in\ncluding evidence of Bies\u2019 mild to borderline mental retar\ndation) against aggravating factors (including the brutal\nity of the crime), the jury recommended a sentence of\ndeath, which the trial court imposed. Ohio\u2019s appellate\ncourts affirmed the conviction and sentence. The Ohio\nSupreme Court, in its 1996 opinion on direct review, ob\nserved that Bies\u2019 \u201cmild to borderline mental retardation\nmerit[ed] some weight in mitigation,\u201d but concluded that\n2                            BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigat\ning factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Bies, 74\nOhio St. 3d 320, 328, 658 N. E. 2d 754, 761\u2013762.\n   After this Court decided Atkins, the Ohio trial court\nordered a full hearing on the question of Bies\u2019 mental\ncapacity. The federal courts intervened, however, grant\ning habeas relief to Bies, and ordering the vacation of his\ndeath sentence. Affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment,\nthe Sixth Circuit reasoned that the Ohio Supreme Court,\nin 1996, had definitively determined, as a matter of fact,\nBies\u2019 mental retardation. That finding, the Court of Ap\npeals concluded, established Bies\u2019 \u201clegal entitlement to a\nlife sentence.\u201d Bies v. Bagley, 519 F. 3d 324, 334, n. 6\n(CA6 2008). Therefore, the Sixth Circuit ruled, the Double\nJeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution barred any\nrenewed inquiry into the matter of Bies\u2019 mental state.\n   We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The\nSixth Circuit, in common with the District Court, funda\nmentally misperceived the application of the Double Jeop\nardy Clause and its issue preclusion (collateral estoppel)\ncomponent.1 First, Bies was not \u201ctwice put in jeopardy.\u201d\nHe was sentenced to death, and Ohio sought no further\nprosecution or punishment. Instead of \u201cserial prosecutions\nby the government[,] this case involves serial efforts by the\ndefendant to vacate his capital sentence.\u201d Bies v. Bagley,\n535 F. 3d 520, 531\u2013532 (CA6 2008) (Sutton, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Further, mental retardation for purposes\nof Atkins, and mental retardation as one mitigator to be\nweighed against aggravators, are discrete issues. Most\ngrave among the Sixth Circuit\u2019s misunderstandings, issue\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 \u201c[R]eplac[ing]a more confusing lexicon,\u201d the term \u201cissue preclusion,\u201d\nin current usage, \u201cencompasses the doctrines [earlier called] \u2018collateral\nestoppel\u2019 and \u2018direct estoppel.\u2019 \u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. ___, ___, n.\n5 (2008) (slip op., at 9, n. 5).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npreclusion is a plea available to prevailing parties. The\ndoctrine bars relitigation of determinations necessary to\nthe ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding. The Ohio\ncourts\u2019 recognition of Bies\u2019 mental state as a mitigating\nfactor was hardly essential to the death sentence he re\nceived. On the contrary, the retardation evidence cut\nagainst the final judgment. Issue preclusion, in short,\ndoes not transform final judgment losers, in civil or crimi\nnal proceedings, into partially prevailing parties.\n                              I\n  For his part in brutally causing the death of a ten-year\nold boy, Bies was convicted by an Ohio jury of attempted\nrape, kidnaping, and aggravated murder with three death\npenalty specifications. App. 85; Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\u00a72929.04(A)(3), (7) (Lexis 2006).\n  At sentencing, Bies presented testimony from clinical\npsychiatrist Donna E. Winter, who had evaluated him at\nthe court\u2019s order during the guilt phase and again before\nthe mitigation hearing. App. 191, 202. Bies did not\nqualify for a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, Dr.\nWinter concluded, because he knew the difference between\nright and wrong at the time of the offense. Id., at 36, 51,\n198\u2013200. Bies\u2019 IQ, she further reported, fell in the 65\u201375\nrange, id., at 211\u2013212, indicating that he is \u201cmildly\nmentally retarded to borderline mentally retarded,\u201d id., at\n20\u201321, 32, 199\u2013200, 213. Dr. Winter also observed: \u201c[Bies]\ngoes about the community, unassisted [and] carries out\nthe activities of daily life fairly independently.\u201d Id., at\n199. The State responded to Bies\u2019 mitigating evidence by\nemphasizing the brutality of the murder and the risk of\nBies\u2019 future dangerousness. Instructed to weigh the\nmitigating circumstances against aggravating factors, the\njury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court\nimposed. Id., at 88\u201389.\n  The Ohio Court of Appeals and Supreme Court each\n4                      BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindependently reviewed the evidence and affirmed. Id., at\n84\u2013108; Bies, 74 Ohio St. 3d 320, 658 N. E. 2d 754.\nNeither court devoted detailed attention to the issue of\nretardation. Both concluded that Bies\u2019 mild to borderline\nmental retardation merited \u201csome weight\u201d in mitigation,\nas did his youth and lack of a criminal record. App. 105\u2013\n106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N. E. 2d, at 762. The\naggravating      circumstances,      each    court    found,\noverwhelmed the mitigating circumstances beyond a\nreasonable doubt. App. 106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658\nN. E. 2d, at 762. We denied Bies\u2019 petition for a writ of\ncertiorari. Bies v. Ohio, 517 U. S. 1238 (1996).\n  Bies then filed a petition for state postconviction relief,\ncontending for the first time that the Eighth Amendment\nto the Federal Constitution prohibits execution of a men\ntally retarded defendant. The trial court agreed that Bies\nwas \u201cmildly mentally retarded,\u201d but concluded that, under\nthen-governing Ohio precedent, \u201ca mildly mentally re\ntarded defendant may be [p]unished by execution.\u201d App.\n153. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment,\nid., at 175\u2013176, and the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed\nBies\u2019 appeal without an opinion, State v. Bies, 87 Ohio St.\n3d 1440, 719 N. E. 2d 4 (1999) (Table).\n  Bies next filed a federal habeas petition in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.\nSoon after that filing, this Court held, in Atkins v. Vir\nginia, 536 U. S., at 321, that the Eighth Amendment\nprohibits execution of mentally retarded offenders. Our\nopinion did not provide definitive procedural or\nsubstantive guides for determining when a person who\nclaims mental retardation \u201cwill be so impaired as to fall\n[within Atkins\u2019 compass].\u201d We \u201c le[ft] to the States the\ntask of developing appropriate ways to enforce the\nconstitutional restriction.\u201d Id., at 317 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n  Ohio heeded Atkins\u2019 call six months later in State v.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

At an Atkins hearing, the Ohio\nSupreme Court held, a defendant must prove: \u201c(1)\nsignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2)\nsignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such\nas communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3)\nonset before the age of 18.\u201d 97 Ohio St. 3d, at 305, 779\nN. E. 2d, at 1014. \u201cIQ tests,\u201d the court stated, \u201care one of\nthe many factors that need to be considered, [but] they\nalone are not sufficient to make a final determination [of\nretardation].\u201d     Ibid.   The court also announced \u201ca\nrebuttable presumption that a defendant is not mentally\nretarded if his or her IQ is above 70.\u201d Ibid.\n  The District Court stayed its proceedings on Bies\u2019\nfederal habeas petition while Bies presented an Atkins\nclaim to the state postconviction court. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 83a. Bies there moved for summary judgment,\narguing that the record established his mental\nretardation, and that the State was \u201cprecluded and\nestopped\u201d from disputing it. Id., at 104a. The state court\nrecognized that Atkins and Lott had materially changed\nthe significance of a mental retardation finding. The court\nobserved that mental retardation had not previously been\nestablished under the Atkins-Lott framework; given those\nprecedent-setting decisions, the court concluded, \u201cthere is\na serious issue as to Mr. Bies\u2019 mental status.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 104a. Accordingly, the court denied summary\njudgment and ordered a full hearing on the Atkins claim.\n  Rather than proceeding with the hearing directed by the\nstate court, Bies returned to the Federal District Court.\nHe argued that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy\nClause, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth\nAmendment, barred the State from relitigating the issue\nof his mental condition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 81a. The\nDistrict Court granted the habeas petition and ordered\nvacation of Bies\u2019 death sentence. Id., at 68a.\n6                      BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 519 F. 3d 324, 342. It\nconcluded that Bies\u2019 case was \u201ccontrolled by\u201d Ashe v.\nSwenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), which held that the doc\ntrine of issue preclusion \u201cis embodied in the Fifth Amend\nment guarantee against double jeopardy.\u201d 519 F. 3d, at\n332 (quoting 397 U. S., at 445). The Court of Appeals\nfound all requirements for issue preclusion met in Bies\u2019\ncase. It concluded, inter alia, that the Ohio Supreme\nCourt, in resolving Bies\u2019 direct appeal, had decided the\nissue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation under the same standard\nlater adopted in Lott. 519 F. 3d, at 336. Further, the\nCourt of Appeals held, the state court\u2019s recognition that\nBies qualified as mentally retarded had been necessary to\nthe judgment imposing the death sentence. \u201c[D]etermining\nwhich mitigating factors are actually present,\u201d the court\nreasoned, \u201cis a necessary first step to determining whether\nthose factors outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u201d\nId., at 337.\n   The Court of Appeals denied the State\u2019s petition for\nrehearing en banc. 535 F. 3d 520. Judge Clay, concur\nring, opined that Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101\n(2003), provided an additional, independent basis for\naffirmance. 535 F. 3d, at 523\u2013524. Under that decision,\nhe noted, jeopardy attaches, and relitigation is precluded,\nonce a judge or jury has \u201cacquitted\u201d a capital defendant\n\u201cby entering findings sufficient to establish legal entitle\nment to [a] life sentence.\u201d Id., at 522 (quoting Sattazahn,\n537 U. S., at 108\u2013109). In Bies\u2019 case, Judge Clay con\ncluded, the Ohio courts\u2019 determination of mental retarda\ntion \u201centitle[d]\u201d Bies to a life sentence, and thus the Dou\nble Jeopardy Clause barred the State from disputing the\nissue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation. 535 F. 3d, at 523\u2013524.\n   Judge Sutton dissented from the denial of rehearing en\nbanc.

S., at 109.\nSattazahn offers Bies no aid. In that case, the defendant\u2019s\nfirst capital jury had deadlocked at the penalty phase, and\nthe court, as required by state law, entered a life sentence.\nId., at 104\u2013105. This Court held the Double Jeopardy\nClause did not bar the State\u2019s request for the death pen\nalty at the defendant\u2019s retrial, noting that \u201cneither the\njudge nor the jury had acquitted the defendant in his first\n. . . proceeding by entering findings sufficient to establish\nlegal entitlement to the life sentence.\u201d Id., at 108\u2013109\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n    Here, as in Sattazahn, there was no acquittal. Bies\u2019 jury\nvoted to impose the death penalty. At issue now is Bies\u2019\n\u201csecond run at vacating his death sentence,\u201d 535 F. 3d, at\n531 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc), not an effort by the State to retry him or to increase\nhis punishment.\n    Nor did any state-court determination of Bies\u2019 mental\nretardation \u201centitl[e]\u201d him to a life sentence. Cf. id., at\n523 (Clay, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).\nAt the time Bies was sentenced and on direct appeal,\nPenry, not Atkins, was this Court\u2019s guiding decision.\n8                       BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder Penry, no single mitigator or aggravator was de\nterminative of the judgment. Instead, the dispositive\nissue, correctly comprehended by the Ohio courts, was\nwhether \u201cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the\nmitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Bies, 74\nOhio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N. E. 2d, at 762.\n                               B\n   The Court of Appeals panel relied primarily on the\ndoctrine of issue preclusion, recognized in Ashe to be \u201cem\nbodied in\u201d the Double Jeopardy Clause. 397 U. S., at 445.\nPreclusion doctrine, however, does not bar a full airing of\nthe issue whether Bies qualifies as mentally retarded\nunder Atkins and Lott.\n   Issue preclusion bars successive litigation of \u201can issue of\nfact or law\u201d that \u201cis actually litigated and determined by a\nvalid and final judgment, and . . . is essential to the judg\nment.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a727 (1980)\n(hereinafter Restatement). If a judgment does not depend\non a given determination, relitigation of that determina\ntion is not precluded. Id., \u00a727, Comment h. In addition,\neven where the core requirements of issue preclusion are\nmet, an exception to the general rule may apply when a\n\u201cchange in [the] applicable legal context\u201d intervenes. Id.,\n\u00a728, Comment c.\n   As an initial matter, it is not clear from the spare\nstatements of the Ohio appellate courts that the issue of\nBies\u2019 mental retardation under the Lott test was actually\ndetermined at trial or during Bies\u2019 direct appeal. No court\nfound, for example, that Bies suffered \u201csignificant\nlimitations in two or more adaptive skills.\u201d Lott, 97 Ohio\nSt. 3d, at 305, 779 N. E. 2d, at 1014. Nor did the State\nconcede that Bies would succeed under Atkins and Lott,\nwhich had not then been decided.\n   More fundamental, it is clear that the courts\u2019 statements\nregarding Bies\u2019 mental capacity were not necessary to the\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudgments affirming his death sentence. A determination\nranks as necessary or essential only when the final out\ncome hinges on it. See 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74421, p. 543 (2d\ned. 2002). \u201cFar from being necessary to the judgment, the\nOhio courts\u2019 mental-retardation findings cut against it\u2014\nmaking them quintessentially the kinds of rulings not\neligible for issue-preclusion treatment.\u201d 535 F. 3d, at 533\n(Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n   In finding the state court\u2019s determination \u201cnecessary to\n[the] judgment,\u201d 519 F. 3d, at 342, the Court of Appeals\npanel reasoned that the Ohio courts determined Bies\u2019\nmental capacity pursuant to their \u201cmandatory duty\u201d to\nweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Id.,\nat 338. \u201c[W]eighing [aggravators against mitigators],\u201d the\npanel explained, \u201ccould not have occurred unless the court\nfirst determined what to place on either side of the scale.\u201d\nIbid. This reasoning conflates a determination necessary\nto the bottom-line judgment with a subsidiary finding\nthat, standing alone, is not outcome determinative. Issue\npreclusion cannot transform Bies\u2019 loss at the sentencing\nphase into a partial victory.\n   For the same reason, the Court of Appeals erred in its\nrepeated reliance on the following passage in Ashe: \u201cWhen\nan issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a\nvalid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be\nlitigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d\n519 F. 3d, at 331\u2013333 (quoting 397 U. S., at 443). Bies\u2019\ncase does not involve an \u201cultimate fact\u201d of the kind our\ndecision in Ashe addressed. There, the State sought to try\nAshe for robbing a poker player even though a jury had\nalready acquitted him of robbing a different player in the\nsame poker game. The State\u2019s second attempt was pre\ncluded, we held, because the first jury had based its ver\ndict of acquittal upon a determination that Ashe was not\none of the participants in the poker game robbery. Id., at\n10                          BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n445. Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted\u2014and, as already\nobserved, determinations of his mental capacity were not\nnecessary to the ultimate imposition of the death penalty.2\n   Moreover, even if the core requirements for issue pre\nclusion had been met, an exception to the doctrine\u2019s appli\ncation would be warranted due to this Court\u2019s intervening\ndecision in Atkins. Mental retardation as a mitigator and\nmental retardation under Atkins and Lott are discrete\nlegal issues. The Atkins decision itself highlights one\ndifference: \u201c[R]eliance on mental retardation as a mitigat\ning factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the\nlikelihood that the aggravating factor of future danger\nousness will be found by the jury.\u201d 536 U. S., at 321. This\nreality explains why prosecutors, pre-Atkins, had little\nincentive vigorously to contest evidence of retardation.\nSee App. 65 (excerpt from prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\ndescribing as Bies\u2019 \u201c[c]hief characteristic\u201d his \u201csensitivity\nto any kind of frustration and his rapid tendency to get\nenraged\u201d); id., at 39\u201354 (cross-examination of Bies\u2019 expert\nwitness designed to emphasize Bies\u2019 dangerousness to\nothers). Because the change in law substantially altered\nthe State\u2019s incentive to contest Bies\u2019 mental capacity,\napplying preclusion would not advance the equitable\nadministration of the law. See Restatement \u00a728, Com\nment c.\n   The federal courts\u2019 intervention in this case derailed a\nstate trial court proceeding \u201cdesigned to determine\nwhether Bies ha[s] a successful Atkins claim.\u201d 535 F. 3d,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This case, we note, is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996. Bies plainly fails to qualify for relief under\nthat Act: The Ohio courts\u2019 decisions were not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), and were not \u201cbased on an unreasonable determi\nnation of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2).

BIES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u2013598.      Argued April 27, 2009\u2014Decided June 1, 2009\nIn Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, this Court held that the Eighth\n  Amendment bars execution of mentally retarded offenders. Prior to\n  Atkins, mental retardation merited consideration as a mitigating fac\n  tor, but did not bar imposition of the death penalty. See Penry v. Ly\n  naugh, 492 U. S. 302. Nearly a decade before Atkins, respondent\n  Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kid\n  naping, and attempted rape of a ten-year-old boy. Instructed at the\n  sentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (including evi\n  dence of Bies\u2019 mild to borderline mental retardation) against aggra\n  vating factors (including the crime\u2019s brutality), the jury recommended\n  a death sentence, which the trial court imposed. Ohio\u2019s Court of Ap\n  peals and Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence, each\n  concluding that Bies\u2019 mental retardation was entitled to \u201csome\n  weight\u201d as a mitigating factor, but that the aggravating circum\n  stances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Bies then filed an\n  unsuccessful petition for state postconviction relief, contending for\n  the first time that the Eighth Amendment prohibits execution of a\n  mentally retarded defendant. Soon after Bies sought federal habeas\n  relief, this Court decided Atkins. The opinion left to the States the\n  task of developing appropriate ways to determine when a person\n  claiming mental retardation would fall within Atkins\u2019 compass. Ohio\n  heeded Atkins\u2019 call in State v. Lott. The District Court then stayed\n  Bies\u2019 federal habeas proceedings so that he could present an Atkins\n  claim to the state postconviction court. Observing that Bies\u2019 mental\n  retardation had not previously been established under the Atkins-\n  Lott framework, the state court denied Bies\u2019 motion for summary\n  judgment and ordered a full hearing on the Atkins claim. Rather\n  than proceeding with that hearing, Bies returned to federal court, ar\n2                             BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    guing that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from reliti\n    gating the mental retardation issue. The District Court granted the\n    habeas petition, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. Relying on Ashe v.\n    Swenson, 397 U. S. 436, the Court of Appeals determined that all re\n    quirements for the issue preclusion component of the Double Jeop\n    ardy Clause were met in Bies\u2019 case. It concluded, inter alia, that the\n    Ohio Supreme Court, on direct appeal, had decided the mental retar\n    dation issue under the same standard that court later adopted in\n    Lott, and that the state court\u2019s recognition of Bies\u2019 mental state had\n    been necessary to the death penalty judgment. When the Sixth Cir\n    cuit denied the State\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, a concurring\n    judge offered an alternative basis for decision. He opined that, under\n    Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, jeopardy attaches once a\n    capital defendant is \u201cacquitted\u201d based on findings establishing an en\n    titlement to a life sentence; reasoning that the Ohio courts\u2019 mental\n    retardation findings entitled Bies to a life sentence, he concluded that\n    the Double Jeopardy Clause barred any renewed inquiry into Bies\u2019\n    mental state.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the Ohio courts from\n conducting a full hearing on Bies\u2019 mental capacity. Pp. 7\u201311.\n    (a) The alternative basis for decision offered by the concurring\n opinion at the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rehearing stage is rejected. The State\n did not \u201ctwice put [Bies] in jeopardy,\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, in the\n core constitutional sense. Sattazahn offers Bies no aid, for there was\n no acquittal here. Bies\u2019 jury voted to impose the death penalty. At\n issue is his attempt to vacate that sentence, not an effort by the State\n to retry him or to increase his punishment. Nor did the state courts\u2019\n mental retardation determinations entitle Bies to a life sentence. At\n the time of his sentencing and direct appeal, Penry, not Atkins, was\n the guiding decision, and the dispositive issue was whether the miti\n gating factors were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances be\n yond a reasonable doubt. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) The issue preclusion doctrine, on which the Sixth Circuit panel\n primarily relied, does not bar a full airing of the issue whether Bies\n qualifies as mentally retarded under Atkins and Lott. The doctrine\n bars relitigation of issues actually determined and necessary to the\n ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding. Initially, it is not clear that\n the issue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation was actually determined under\n the Lott test at trial or on direct appeal. Nor did the State concede\n that Bies would succeed under Atkins and Lott, which had not then\n been decided. More fundamental, it is clear that the state courts\u2019\n statements regarding Bies\u2019 mental capacity were not necessary to the\n judgments affirming his death sentence. Instead, those determina\n tions cut against the ultimate outcome. In holding otherwise, the\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Sixth Circuit conflated a determination necessary to the bottom-line\n  judgment with a subsidiary finding that, standing alone, is not out\n  come determinative. The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on Ashe\u2019s\n  statement: \u201c[W]hen an issue of ultimate fact has once been deter\n  mined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be liti\n  gated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d 397 U. S., at\n  443. Bies\u2019 case does not involve the kind of \u201cultimate fact\u201d addressed\n  in Ashe. There, the State was precluded from trying Ashe for robbing\n  a poker player because he had already been acquitted of robbing a\n  different player in the same poker game, and the acquittal was based\n  on a determination that Ashe was not a participant in the poker\n  game robbery. Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted, and determina\n  tions of his mental capacity were not necessary to the ultimate impo\n  sition of the death penalty. Moreover, even if the core issue preclu\n  sion requirements had been met, an exception to the doctrine\u2019s\n  application would be warranted due to the intervening Atkins deci\n  sion. Mental retardation as a mitigator and mental retardation un\n  der Atkins and Lott are discrete legal issues. One difference is that\n  mental retardation, urged as a mitigating factor, may instead \u201cen\n  hance the likelihood that [a jury will find] the aggravating factor of\n  future dangerousness.\u201d Atkins 536 U. S., at 521. This reality ex\n  plains why prosecutors, pre-Atkins, had little incentive to contest re\n  tardation evidence. Because the change in law substantially altered\n  the State\u2019s incentive to contest Bies\u2019 mental capacity, applying pre\n  clusion would not advance the equitable administration of the law.\n  The federal courts\u2019 intervention in this case derailed the state-court\n  proceeding. Recourse first to Ohio\u2019s courts is what this Court envi\n  sioned in remitting to the States responsibility for implementing At\n  kins.

Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002), this Court\nheld that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of \u201ccruel\nand unusual punishments\u201d bars execution of mentally\nretarded offenders. Prior to Atkins, the Court had deter\nmined that mental retardation merited consideration as a\nmitigating factor, but did not bar imposition of the death\npenalty. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989).\n   In 1992, nearly a decade before the Court\u2019s decision in\nAtkins, respondent Michael Bies was tried and convicted\nin Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnaping, and at\ntempted rape of a ten-year-old boy. Instructed at the\nsentencing stage to weigh mitigating circumstances (in\ncluding evidence of Bies\u2019 mild to borderline mental retar\ndation) against aggravating factors (including the brutal\nity of the crime), the jury recommended a sentence of\ndeath, which the trial court imposed. Ohio\u2019s appellate\ncourts affirmed the conviction and sentence. The Ohio\nSupreme Court, in its 1996 opinion on direct review, ob\nserved that Bies\u2019 \u201cmild to borderline mental retardation\nmerit[ed] some weight in mitigation,\u201d but concluded that\n2                            BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigat\ning factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v.

E. 2d 754, 761\u2013762.\n   After this Court decided Atkins, the Ohio trial court\nordered a full hearing on the question of Bies\u2019 mental\ncapacity. The federal courts intervened, however, grant\ning habeas relief to Bies, and ordering the vacation of his\ndeath sentence. Affirming the District Court\u2019s judgment,\nthe Sixth Circuit reasoned that the Ohio Supreme Court,\nin 1996, had definitively determined, as a matter of fact,\nBies\u2019 mental retardation. That finding, the Court of Ap\npeals concluded, established Bies\u2019 \u201clegal entitlement to a\nlife sentence.\u201d Bies v. Bagley, 519 F. 3d 324, 334, n. 6\n(CA6 2008). Therefore, the Sixth Circuit ruled, the Double\nJeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution barred any\nrenewed inquiry into the matter of Bies\u2019 mental state.\n   We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The\nSixth Circuit, in common with the District Court, funda\nmentally misperceived the application of the Double Jeop\nardy Clause and its issue preclusion (collateral estoppel)\ncomponent.1 First, Bies was not \u201ctwice put in jeopardy.\u201d\nHe was sentenced to death, and Ohio sought no further\nprosecution or punishment. Instead of \u201cserial prosecutions\nby the government[,] this case involves serial efforts by the\ndefendant to vacate his capital sentence.\u201d Bies v. Bagley,\n535 F. 3d 520, 531\u2013532 (CA6 2008) (Sutton, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).

The\ndoctrine bars relitigation of determinations necessary to\nthe ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding. The Ohio\ncourts\u2019 recognition of Bies\u2019 mental state as a mitigating\nfactor was hardly essential to the death sentence he re\nceived. On the contrary, the retardation evidence cut\nagainst the final judgment. Issue preclusion, in short,\ndoes not transform final judgment losers, in civil or crimi\nnal proceedings, into partially prevailing parties.\n                              I\n  For his part in brutally causing the death of a ten-year\nold boy, Bies was convicted by an Ohio jury of attempted\nrape, kidnaping, and aggravated murder with three death\npenalty specifications. App. 85; Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n\u00a72929.04(A)(3), (7) (Lexis 2006).\n  At sentencing, Bies presented testimony from clinical\npsychiatrist Donna E. Winter, who had evaluated him at\nthe court\u2019s order during the guilt phase and again before\nthe mitigation hearing. App. 191, 202. Bies did not\nqualify for a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, Dr.\nWinter concluded, because he knew the difference between\nright and wrong at the time of the offense. Id., at 36, 51,\n198\u2013200. Bies\u2019 IQ, she further reported, fell in the 65\u201375\nrange, id., at 211\u2013212, indicating that he is \u201cmildly\nmentally retarded to borderline mentally retarded,\u201d id., at\n20\u201321, 32, 199\u2013200, 213. Dr. Winter also observed: \u201c[Bies]\ngoes about the community, unassisted [and] carries out\nthe activities of daily life fairly independently.\u201d Id., at\n199. The State responded to Bies\u2019 mitigating evidence by\nemphasizing the brutality of the murder and the risk of\nBies\u2019 future dangerousness. Instructed to weigh the\nmitigating circumstances against aggravating factors, the\njury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court\nimposed.

Both concluded that Bies\u2019 mild to borderline\nmental retardation merited \u201csome weight\u201d in mitigation,\nas did his youth and lack of a criminal record. App. 105\u2013\n106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N. E. 2d, at 762. The\naggravating      circumstances,      each    court    found,\noverwhelmed the mitigating circumstances beyond a\nreasonable doubt. App. 106; 74 Ohio St. 3d, at 328, 658\nN. E. 2d, at 762. We denied Bies\u2019 petition for a writ of\ncertiorari. Bies v. Ohio, 517 U. S. 1238 (1996).\n  Bies then filed a petition for state postconviction relief,\ncontending for the first time that the Eighth Amendment\nto the Federal Constitution prohibits execution of a men\ntally retarded defendant. The trial court agreed that Bies\nwas \u201cmildly mentally retarded,\u201d but concluded that, under\nthen-governing Ohio precedent, \u201ca mildly mentally re\ntarded defendant may be [p]unished by execution.\u201d App.\n153. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment,\nid., at 175\u2013176, and the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed\nBies\u2019 appeal without an opinion, State v. Bies, 87 Ohio St.\n3d 1440, 719 N.

At an Atkins hearing, the Ohio\nSupreme Court held, a defendant must prove: \u201c(1)\nsignificantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2)\nsignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such\nas communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3)\nonset before the age of 18.\u201d 97 Ohio St. 3d, at 305, 779\nN.

The court also announced \u201ca\nrebuttable presumption that a defendant is not mentally\nretarded if his or her IQ is above 70.\u201d Ibid.\n  The District Court stayed its proceedings on Bies\u2019\nfederal habeas petition while Bies presented an Atkins\nclaim to the state postconviction court. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 83a. Bies there moved for summary judgment,\narguing that the record established his mental\nretardation, and that the State was \u201cprecluded and\nestopped\u201d from disputing it. Id., at 104a. The state court\nrecognized that Atkins and Lott had materially changed\nthe significance of a mental retardation finding. The court\nobserved that mental retardation had not previously been\nestablished under the Atkins-Lott framework; given those\nprecedent-setting decisions, the court concluded, \u201cthere is\na serious issue as to Mr. Bies\u2019 mental status.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 104a. Accordingly, the court denied summary\njudgment and ordered a full hearing on the Atkins claim.\n  Rather than proceeding with the hearing directed by the\nstate court, Bies returned to the Federal District Court.\nHe argued that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy\nClause, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth\nAmendment, barred the State from relitigating the issue\nof his mental condition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 81a. The\nDistrict Court granted the habeas petition and ordered\nvacation of Bies\u2019 death sentence. Id., at 68a.\n6                      BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 519 F. 3d 324, 342. It\nconcluded that Bies\u2019 case was \u201ccontrolled by\u201d Ashe v.\nSwenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), which held that the doc\ntrine of issue preclusion \u201cis embodied in the Fifth Amend\nment guarantee against double jeopardy.\u201d 519 F. 3d, at\n332 (quoting 397 U. S., at 445). The Court of Appeals\nfound all requirements for issue preclusion met in Bies\u2019\ncase. It concluded, inter alia, that the Ohio Supreme\nCourt, in resolving Bies\u2019 direct appeal, had decided the\nissue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation under the same standard\nlater adopted in Lott. 519 F. 3d, at 336. Further, the\nCourt of Appeals held, the state court\u2019s recognition that\nBies qualified as mentally retarded had been necessary to\nthe judgment imposing the death sentence. \u201c[D]etermining\nwhich mitigating factors are actually present,\u201d the court\nreasoned, \u201cis a necessary first step to determining whether\nthose factors outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u201d\nId., at 337.\n   The Court of Appeals denied the State\u2019s petition for\nrehearing en banc. 535 F. 3d 520. Judge Clay, concur\nring, opined that Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101\n(2003), provided an additional, independent basis for\naffirmance. 535 F. 3d, at 523\u2013524. Under that decision,\nhe noted, jeopardy attaches, and relitigation is precluded,\nonce a judge or jury has \u201cacquitted\u201d a capital defendant\n\u201cby entering findings sufficient to establish legal entitle\nment to [a] life sentence.\u201d Id., at 522 (quoting Sattazahn,\n537 U. S., at 108\u2013109). In Bies\u2019 case, Judge Clay con\ncluded, the Ohio courts\u2019 determination of mental retarda\ntion \u201centitle[d]\u201d Bies to a life sentence, and thus the Dou\nble Jeopardy Clause barred the State from disputing the\nissue of Bies\u2019 mental retardation. 535 F. 3d, at 523\u2013524.\n   Judge Sutton dissented from the denial of rehearing en\nbanc. Sattazahn was inapposite, he maintained, because\nBies was never \u201ctwice put in jeopardy.\u201d 535 F. 3d, at 531\n(internal quotation marks omitted).

The State did not \u201ctwice put [Bies]\nin jeopardy,\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, in the core constitu\ntional sense. \u201c[T]he touchstone for double-jeopardy protec\ntion in capital-sentencing proceedings is whether there\nhas been an \u2018acquittal.\u2019 \u201d Sattazahn, 537 U. S., at 109.\nSattazahn offers Bies no aid. In that case, the defendant\u2019s\nfirst capital jury had deadlocked at the penalty phase, and\nthe court, as required by state law, entered a life sentence.\nId., at 104\u2013105. This Court held the Double Jeopardy\nClause did not bar the State\u2019s request for the death pen\nalty at the defendant\u2019s retrial, noting that \u201cneither the\njudge nor the jury had acquitted the defendant in his first\n. . . proceeding by entering findings sufficient to establish\nlegal entitlement to the life sentence.\u201d Id., at 108\u2013109\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n    Here, as in Sattazahn, there was no acquittal. Bies\u2019 jury\nvoted to impose the death penalty. At issue now is Bies\u2019\n\u201csecond run at vacating his death sentence,\u201d 535 F. 3d, at\n531 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc), not an effort by the State to retry him or to increase\nhis punishment.\n    Nor did any state-court determination of Bies\u2019 mental\nretardation \u201centitl[e]\u201d him to a life sentence. Cf. id., at\n523 (Clay, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).\nAt the time Bies was sentenced and on direct appeal,\nPenry, not Atkins, was this Court\u2019s guiding decision.\n8                       BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder Penry, no single mitigator or aggravator was de\nterminative of the judgment. Instead, the dispositive\nissue, correctly comprehended by the Ohio courts, was\nwhether \u201cthe aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the\nmitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Bies, 74\nOhio St. 3d, at 328, 658 N. E. 2d, at 762.\n                               B\n   The Court of Appeals panel relied primarily on the\ndoctrine of issue preclusion, recognized in Ashe to be \u201cem\nbodied in\u201d the Double Jeopardy Clause. 397 U. S., at 445.\nPreclusion doctrine, however, does not bar a full airing of\nthe issue whether Bies qualifies as mentally retarded\nunder Atkins and Lott.\n   Issue preclusion bars successive litigation of \u201can issue of\nfact or law\u201d that \u201cis actually litigated and determined by a\nvalid and final judgment, and . . . is essential to the judg\nment.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a727 (1980)\n(hereinafter Restatement). If a judgment does not depend\non a given determination, relitigation of that determina\ntion is not precluded. Id., \u00a727, Comment h. In addition,\neven where the core requirements of issue preclusion are\nmet, an exception to the general rule may apply when a\n\u201cchange in [the] applicable legal context\u201d intervenes. Id.,\n\u00a728, Comment c.\n   As an initial matter, it is not clear from the spare\nstatements of the Ohio appellate courts that the issue of\nBies\u2019 mental retardation under the Lott test was actually\ndetermined at trial or during Bies\u2019 direct appeal. No court\nfound, for example, that Bies suffered \u201csignificant\nlimitations in two or more adaptive skills.\u201d Lott, 97 Ohio\nSt. 3d, at 305, 779 N. E. 2d, at 1014. Nor did the State\nconcede that Bies would succeed under Atkins and Lott,\nwhich had not then been decided.\n   More fundamental, it is clear that the courts\u2019 statements\nregarding Bies\u2019 mental capacity were not necessary to the\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudgments affirming his death sentence. A determination\nranks as necessary or essential only when the final out\ncome hinges on it. See 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a74421, p. 543 (2d\ned. 2002). \u201cFar from being necessary to the judgment, the\nOhio courts\u2019 mental-retardation findings cut against it\u2014\nmaking them quintessentially the kinds of rulings not\neligible for issue-preclusion treatment.\u201d 535 F. 3d, at 533\n(Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n   In finding the state court\u2019s determination \u201cnecessary to\n[the] judgment,\u201d 519 F. 3d, at 342, the Court of Appeals\npanel reasoned that the Ohio courts determined Bies\u2019\nmental capacity pursuant to their \u201cmandatory duty\u201d to\nweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Id.,\nat 338. \u201c[W]eighing [aggravators against mitigators],\u201d the\npanel explained, \u201ccould not have occurred unless the court\nfirst determined what to place on either side of the scale.\u201d\nIbid. This reasoning conflates a determination necessary\nto the bottom-line judgment with a subsidiary finding\nthat, standing alone, is not outcome determinative. Issue\npreclusion cannot transform Bies\u2019 loss at the sentencing\nphase into a partial victory.\n   For the same reason, the Court of Appeals erred in its\nrepeated reliance on the following passage in Ashe: \u201cWhen\nan issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a\nvalid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be\nlitigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d\n519 F. 3d, at 331\u2013333 (quoting 397 U. S., at 443). Bies\u2019\ncase does not involve an \u201cultimate fact\u201d of the kind our\ndecision in Ashe addressed. There, the State sought to try\nAshe for robbing a poker player even though a jury had\nalready acquitted him of robbing a different player in the\nsame poker game. The State\u2019s second attempt was pre\ncluded, we held, because the first jury had based its ver\ndict of acquittal upon a determination that Ashe was not\none of the participants in the poker game robbery. Id., at\n10                          BOBBY v. BIES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n445. Bies, in contrast, was not acquitted\u2014and, as already\nobserved, determinations of his mental capacity were not\nnecessary to the ultimate imposition of the death penalty.2\n   Moreover, even if the core requirements for issue pre\nclusion had been met, an exception to the doctrine\u2019s appli\ncation would be warranted due to this Court\u2019s intervening\ndecision in Atkins. Mental retardation as a mitigator and\nmental retardation under Atkins and Lott are discrete\nlegal issues. The Atkins decision itself highlights one\ndifference: \u201c[R]eliance on mental retardation as a mitigat\ning factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the\nlikelihood that the aggravating factor of future danger\nousness will be found by the jury.\u201d 536 U. S., at 321. This\nreality explains why prosecutors, pre-Atkins, had little\nincentive vigorously to contest evidence of retardation.\nSee App. 65 (excerpt from prosecutor\u2019s closing argument\ndescribing as Bies\u2019 \u201c[c]hief characteristic\u201d his \u201csensitivity\nto any kind of frustration and his rapid tendency to get\nenraged\u201d); id., at 39\u201354 (cross-examination of Bies\u2019 expert\nwitness designed to emphasize Bies\u2019 dangerousness to\nothers). Because the change in law substantially altered\nthe State\u2019s incentive to contest Bies\u2019 mental capacity,\napplying preclusion would not advance the equitable\nadministration of the law. See Restatement \u00a728, Com\nment c.\n   The federal courts\u2019 intervention in this case derailed a\nstate trial court proceeding \u201cdesigned to determine\nwhether Bies ha[s] a successful Atkins claim.\u201d 535 F. 3d,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 This case, we note, is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996. Bies plainly fails to qualify for relief under\nthat Act: The Ohio courts\u2019 decisions were not \u201ccontrary to, or . . . an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), and were not \u201cbased on an unreasonable determi\nnation of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2). See also 535 F. 3d, at 534 (CA6 2008) (Sutton,\nJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 534 (Sutton, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc). Recourse first to Ohio\u2019s courts is just what this\nCourt envisioned in remitting to the States responsibility\nfor implementing the Atkins decision. The State acknowl\nedges that Bies is entitled to such recourse, but it rightly\nseeks a full and fair opportunity to contest his plea under\nthe postsentencing precedents set in Atkins and Lott.\n                       *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
