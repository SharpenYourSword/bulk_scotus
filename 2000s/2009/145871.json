UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u2013192.      Argued March 4, 2009\u2014Decided May 26, 2009\nA wiretap of Mohammed Said\u2019s telephone recorded six calls in which\n  petitioner Abuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two sepa\n  rate 1-gram transactions. Those two purchases were misdemeanors\n  under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844, while\n  Said\u2019s two sales were felonies, \u00a7841(a)(1) and (b). The Government\n  charged Abuelhawa with six felonies on the theory that each of the\n  phone calls, some placed by him, some by Said, violated \u00a7843(b),\n  which makes it a felony \u201cto use any communication facility in . . . fa\n  cilitating\u201d felony distribution and other drug crimes. The District\n  Court denied Abuelhawa\u2019s acquittal motion, in which he argued that\n  his efforts to make misdemeanor purchases could not be treated as\n  facilitating Said\u2019s felonies. The jury convicted Abuelhawa on all six\n  felony counts. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \u201cfacili\n  tat[e]\u201d should be given its ordinary meaning in \u00a7843(b) and that\n  Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a phone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facili\n  tation because it made Said\u2019s distribution of the drug easier.\nHeld: Using a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does\n not \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d felony drug distribution in violation of \u00a7843(b).\n Stopping with the plain meaning of \u201cfacilitate\u201d here would ignore the\n rule that because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated\n phrases, \u201c[a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer\n limits of its definitional possibilities.\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\n U. S. 481, 486. Here it does not. The literal sweep of \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d\n sits uncomfortably with common usage: Where a transaction like a\n sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would\n be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the other\u2019s conduct. The\n common usage has its parallel in cases holding that where a statute\n treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the\n2                   ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the\n    other would upend the legislature\u2019s punishment calibration. In Ge\n    bardi v. United States, 287 U. S. 112, 119, for example, the Court\n    held that a woman who voluntarily crossed a state line with a man to\n    have sex could not be tagged with the Mann Act violation for\n    \u201caid[ing] or assist[ing]\u201d interstate transportation for immoral pur\n    poses because the statutory penalties were \u201cclearly directed against\n    the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the\n    subject of the transportation.\u201d Such cases have a bearing here in two\n    ways. First, given the presumption, see, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529\n    U. S. 362, 380\u2013381, and n. 12, that the Congress that enacted \u00a7843(b)\n    was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying\n    terms like \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist,\u201d it is likely the Legislature had a\n    comparable scope in mind when it used \u201cfacilitate,\u201d a word with\n    equivalent meaning. Second, any broader reading would for practical\n    purposes substantially skew the congressional calibration of respec\n    tive buyer-seller penalties. Moreover, the statute\u2019s history\u2014which\n    shows that in 1970 the CSA downgraded simple possession from a\n    felony to a misdemeanor, \u00a7844(a), and simultaneously limited the\n    communications provision\u2019s prohibition of facilitating a drug \u201coffense\u201d\n    to facilitating a \u201cfelony,\u201d \u00a7843(b)\u2014drives home what is clear from the\n    statutory text: Congress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal\n    use more leniently than felony distribution, and to narrow the scope\n    of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a\n    felony. Yet, under the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7843(b), in a substan\n    tial number of cases Congress would for all practical purposes simul\n    taneously have graded back up to felony status with the left hand the\n    same offense, simple drug possession, it had dropped to a misde\n    meanor with the right. Given that Congress used no language spell\n    ing out a purpose so improbable, but legislated against a background\n    usage of terms such as \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d that points in the\n    opposite direction and accords with the CSA\u2019s choice to classify small\n    purchases as misdemeanors, the Government\u2019s position is just too\n    unlikely.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 26, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes it a felony\n\u201cto use any communication facility in committing or in\ncausing or facilitating\u201d certain felonies prohibited by the\nstatute. 84 Stat. 1263, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7843(b). The question\nhere is whether someone violates \u00a7843(b) in making a\nmisdemeanor drug purchase because his phone call to the\ndealer can be said to facilitate the felony of drug distribu\ntion. The answer is no.\n                               I\n   FBI agents believed Mohammed Said was selling co\ncaine and got a warrant to tap his cell phone. In the\ncourse of listening in, they recorded six calls between Said\nand petitioner Salman Khade Abuelhawa, during which\nAbuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two\nseparate transactions, each time a single gram. Abuel\nhawa\u2019s two purchases were misdemeanors, \u00a7844, while\nSaid\u2019s two sales were felonies, \u00a7841(a)(1) and (b). The\nGovernment nonetheless charged Abuelhawa with six\nfelonies on the theory that each of the phone calls,\nwhether placed by Abuelhawa or by Said, had been made\n2                 ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cin causing or facilitating\u201d Said\u2019s felonies, in violation of\n\u00a7843(b).1 Abuelhawa moved for acquittal as a matter of\nlaw, arguing that his efforts to commit the misdemeanors\nof buying cocaine could not be treated as causing or facili\ntating Said\u2019s felonies, but the District Court denied his\nmotion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a\u201325a, and the jury con\nvicted him on all six felony counts.\n  Abuelhawa argued the same point to the Court of Ap\npeals for the Fourth Circuit, with as much success. The\nCircuit reasoned that \u201cfor purposes of \u00a7843(b), \u2018facilitate\u2019\nshould be given its \u2018common meaning\u2014to make easier or\nless difficult, or to assist or aid.\u2019 \u201d 523 F. 3d 415, 420\n(2008) (quoting United States v. Lozano, 839 F. 2d 1020,\n1023 (CA4 1988)). The court said Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a\nphone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facilitation\nbecause it \u201cundoubtedly made Said\u2019s cocaine distribution\neasier; in fact, \u2018it made the sale possible.\u2019 \u201d 523 F. 3d, at\n421 (quoting United States v. Binkley, 903 F. 2d 1130,\n1136 (CA7 1990) (emphasis deleted)). We granted certio\nrari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), to resolve a split among the\nCourts of Appeals on the scope of \u00a7843(b),2 and we now\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 In\n       full, \u00a7843(b) provides:\n  \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to use\nany communication facility in committing or in causing or facilitating\nthe commission of any act or acts constituting a felony under any\nprovision of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter. Each\nseparate use of a communication facility shall be a separate offense\nunder this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term \u2018com\nmunication facility\u2019 means any and all public and private instrumen\ntalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals,\npictures, or sounds of all kinds and includes mail, telephone, wire,\nradio, and all other means of communication.\u201d\n  Section 843(d) provides, subject to exceptions not at issue here, that\n\u201cany person who violates this section shall be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of not more than 4 years, a fine . . . , or both.\u201d\n  2 Compare, e.g., United States v. Binkley, 903 F. 2d 1130, 1135\u20131136\n\n(CA7 1990) (buyer\u2019s use of phone in purchasing drugs facilitates seller\u2019s\ndrug distribution), with United States v.

And of\ncourse on the literal plane, the phone calls could be de\nscribed as \u201cfacilitating\u201d drug distribution; they \u201cundoubt\nedly made . . . distribution easier.\u201d 523 F. 3d, at 421. But\nstopping there would ignore the rule that, because stat\nutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, see\nUnited States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents\nof America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993), \u201c[a] word in a\nstatute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its\ndefinitional possibilities,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\nU. S. 481, 486 (2006). We think the word here does not.\n  To begin with, the Government\u2019s literal sweep of \u201cfacili\ntate\u201d sits uncomfortably with common usage. Where a\ntransaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties\nwith specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as\nfacilitating the conduct of the other. A buyer does not just\nmake a sale easier; he makes the sale possible. No buyer,\nno sale; the buyer\u2019s part is already implied by the term\n\u201csale,\u201d and the word \u201cfacilitate\u201d adds nothing. We would\nnot say that the borrower facilitates the bank loan.\n  The Government, however, replies that using the in\nstrument of communication under \u00a7843(b) is different from\nborrowing the money or merely handing over the sale\nprice for cocaine. Drugs can be sold without anyone\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1098 (CA10 1989) (buyer\u2019s use of phone in purchasing drugs does not\nfacilitate seller\u2019s drug distribution); United States v. Martin, 599 F. 2d\n880, 888\u2013889 (CA9 1979) (same), overruled on other grounds, United\nStates v. De Bright, 730 F. 2d 1255 (CA9 1984).\n4              ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmailing a letter or using a cell phone. Because cell\nphones, say, really do make it easier for dealers to break\nthe law, Congress probably meant to ratchet up the culpa\nbility of the buyer who calls ahead. But we think that\nargument comes up short against several more reasons\nthat count against the Government\u2019s position.\n    The common usage that limits \u201cfacilitate\u201d to the efforts\nof someone other than a primary or necessary actor in the\ncommission of a substantive crime has its parallel in the\ndecided cases. The traditional law is that where a statute\ntreats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently,\nadding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitat\ning the action by the other would upend the calibration of\npunishment set by the legislature, a line of reasoning\nexemplified in the courts\u2019 consistent refusal to treat non\ncriminal liquor purchases as falling under the prohibition\nagainst aiding or abetting the illegal sale of alcohol. See\nLott v. United States, 205 F. 28, 29\u201331 (CA9 1913) (collect\ning cases). And this Court followed the same course in\nrejecting the broadest possible reading of a similar provi\nsion in Gebardi v. United States, 287 U. S. 112 (1932).\nThe question there was whether a woman who voluntarily\ncrossed a state line with a man to engage in \u201cillicit sexual\nrelations\u201d could be tagged with \u201caid[ing] or assist[ing] in\n. . . transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce . . . any\nwoman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or of de\nbauchery, or for any other immoral purpose\u201d in violation of\nthe Mann Act, ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825. Gebardi, 287 U. S., at\n116\u2013118 (internal quotation marks omitted). Since the\nstatutory penalties were \u201cclearly directed against the acts\nof the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the\nsubject of the transportation,\u201d we refused to \u201cinfer that the\nmere acquiescence of the woman transported was intended\nto be condemned by the general language punishing those\nwho aid and assist the transporter, any more than it has\nbeen inferred that the purchaser of liquor was to be re\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngarded as an abettor of the illegal sale.\u201d Id., at 119 (foot\nnote omitted).\n   These cases do not strictly control the outcome of this\none, but we think they have a bearing here, in two ways.\nAs we have said many times, we presume legislatures act\nwith case law in mind, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 380\u2013381, and n. 12 (2000), and we presume here that\nwhen Congress enacted \u00a7843(b), it was familiar with the\ntraditional judicial limitation on applying terms like \u201caid,\u201d\n\u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist.\u201d We thus think it likely that Congress\nhad comparable scope in mind when it used the term\n\u201cfacilitate,\u201d a word with equivalent meaning, compare\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 76 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201caid\nand abet\u201d as to \u201cfacilitate the commission of a crime\u201d) with\nid., at 627 (defining \u201cfacilitation\u201d as \u201c[t]he act or an in\nstance of aiding or helping; . . . the act of making it easier\nfor another person to commit a crime\u201d).\n   And applying the presumption is supported significantly\nby the fact that here, as in the earlier cases, any broader\nreading of \u201cfacilitate\u201d would for practical purposes skew\nthe congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller\npenalties. When the statute was enacted, the use of land\nlines in drug transactions was common, and in these days\nwhen everyone over the age of three seems to carry a cell\nphone, the Government\u2019s interpretation would skew the\ncalibration of penalties very substantially. The respect\nowed to that penalty calibration cannot be minimized.\nPrior to 1970, Congress punished the receipt, concealment,\npurchase, or sale of any narcotic drug as a felony, see 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7174 (1964 ed.) (repealed), and on top of that\nadded a minimum of two years, and up to five, for using a\ncommunication facility in committing, causing, or facilitat\ning, any drug \u201coffense,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71403 (1964 ed.). In\n1970, however, the CSA, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et\nseq., downgraded simple possession of a controlled sub\nstance to a misdemeanor, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a) (2006 ed.),\n6                 ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand simultaneously limited the communications provision\nto prohibiting only the facilitation of a drug \u201cfelony,\u201d\n\u00a7843(b). This history drives home what is already clear in\nthe current statutory text: Congress meant to treat pur\nchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than the\nfelony of distributing drugs, and to narrow the scope of the\ncommunications provision to cover only those who facili\ntate a drug felony. Yet, under the Government\u2019s reading\nof \u00a7843(b), in a substantial number of cases Congress\nwould for all practical purposes simultaneously have\ngraded back up to felony status with the left hand the\nsame offense it had dropped to a misdemeanor with the\nright. As the Government sees it, Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a\nphone in making two small drug purchases would subject\nhim, in fact, to six felony counts and a potential sentence\nof 24 years in prison, even though buying the same drugs\nminus the phone would have supported only two misde\nmeanor counts and two years of prison. Given the CSA\u2019s\ndistinction between simple possession and distribution,\nand the background history of these offenses, it is impos\nsible to believe that Congress intended \u201cfacilitating\u201d to\ncause that twelve-fold quantum leap in punishment for\nsimple drug possessors.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 TheGovernment\u2019s suggestion that a result like this is not anoma\nlous because a prosecutor could exercise his discretion to seek a lower\nsentence, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, simply begs the question. Of course,\nCongress legislates against a background assumption of prosecutorial\ndiscretion, but this tells us nothing about the boundaries of punishment\nwithin which Congress intended the discretion to be exercised; prosecu\ntorial discretion is not a reason for courts to give improbable breadth to\ncriminal statutes. And it ill behooves the Government to invoke discre\ntionary power in this case, with the prosecutor seeking a sentencing\npotential of 24 years when the primary offense is the purchase of two\nounces of cocaine. For that matter, see id., at 41\u201343 (concession by\nGovernment that current Department of Justice guidelines require\nindividual prosecutors who bring charges to charge the maximum crime\nsupported by the facts in a case).\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government suggests that this background usage\nand the 1970 choice to reduce culpability for possession is\nbeside the point because Congress sometimes incorporates\naggravating factors into the Criminal Code, and the phone\nuse here is just one of them; the Government mentions\npossession by a prior drug offender, a felony punishable by\nup to two years\u2019 imprisonment. And, for perspective, the\nGovernment points to unauthorized possession of fluni\ntrazepim, a drug used to incapacitate rape victims, which\nis punishable by imprisonment up to three years. Brief for\nUnited States 20. It would not be strange, the Govern\nment says, for Congress to \u201cdecid[e] to treat the use of a\ncommunication facility in a drug transaction as a signifi\ncant act warranting additional punishment\u201d because\n\u201c[t]oday\u2019s communication facilities . . . make illicit drug\ntransactions easier and more efficient . . . .

There is no question that Congress\nintended \u00a7843(b) to impede illicit drug transactions by\npenalizing the use of communication devices in coordinat\ning illegal drug operations, and no doubt that its purpose\nwill be served regardless of the outcome in this case. But\nit does not follow that Congress also meant a first-time\nbuyer\u2019s phone calls to get two small quantities of drugs for\npersonal use to expose him to punishment 12 times more\nsevere than a purchase by a recidivist offender and 8\ntimes more severe than the unauthorized possession of a\ndrug used by rapists.4 To the contrary, Congress used no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Government does nothing for its own cause by noting that 21\n\nU.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u2013192.      Argued March 4, 2009\u2014Decided May 26, 2009\nA wiretap of Mohammed Said\u2019s telephone recorded six calls in which\n  petitioner Abuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two sepa\n  rate 1-gram transactions. Those two purchases were misdemeanors\n  under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844, while\n  Said\u2019s two sales were felonies, \u00a7841(a)(1) and (b). The Government\n  charged Abuelhawa with six felonies on the theory that each of the\n  phone calls, some placed by him, some by Said, violated \u00a7843(b),\n  which makes it a felony \u201cto use any communication facility in . . . fa\n  cilitating\u201d felony distribution and other drug crimes. The District\n  Court denied Abuelhawa\u2019s acquittal motion, in which he argued that\n  his efforts to make misdemeanor purchases could not be treated as\n  facilitating Said\u2019s felonies. The jury convicted Abuelhawa on all six\n  felony counts. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \u201cfacili\n  tat[e]\u201d should be given its ordinary meaning in \u00a7843(b) and that\n  Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a phone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facili\n  tation because it made Said\u2019s distribution of the drug easier.\nHeld: Using a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does\n not \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d felony drug distribution in violation of \u00a7843(b).\n Stopping with the plain meaning of \u201cfacilitate\u201d here would ignore the\n rule that because statutes are not read as a collection of isolated\n phrases, \u201c[a] word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer\n limits of its definitional possibilities.\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\n U. S. 481, 486. Here it does not. The literal sweep of \u201cfacilitat[e]\u201d\n sits uncomfortably with common usage: Where a transaction like a\n sale necessarily presupposes two parties with specific roles, it would\n be odd to speak of one party as facilitating the other\u2019s conduct. The\n common usage has its parallel in cases holding that where a statute\n treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently, adding to the\n2                   ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the\n    other would upend the legislature\u2019s punishment calibration. In Ge\n    bardi v. United States, 287 U. S. 112, 119, for example, the Court\n    held that a woman who voluntarily crossed a state line with a man to\n    have sex could not be tagged with the Mann Act violation for\n    \u201caid[ing] or assist[ing]\u201d interstate transportation for immoral pur\n    poses because the statutory penalties were \u201cclearly directed against\n    the acts of the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the\n    subject of the transportation.\u201d Such cases have a bearing here in two\n    ways. First, given the presumption, see, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529\n    U. S. 362, 380\u2013381, and n. 12, that the Congress that enacted \u00a7843(b)\n    was familiar with the traditional judicial limitation on applying\n    terms like \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist,\u201d it is likely the Legislature had a\n    comparable scope in mind when it used \u201cfacilitate,\u201d a word with\n    equivalent meaning. Second, any broader reading would for practical\n    purposes substantially skew the congressional calibration of respec\n    tive buyer-seller penalties. Moreover, the statute\u2019s history\u2014which\n    shows that in 1970 the CSA downgraded simple possession from a\n    felony to a misdemeanor, \u00a7844(a), and simultaneously limited the\n    communications provision\u2019s prohibition of facilitating a drug \u201coffense\u201d\n    to facilitating a \u201cfelony,\u201d \u00a7843(b)\u2014drives home what is clear from the\n    statutory text: Congress meant to treat purchasing drugs for personal\n    use more leniently than felony distribution, and to narrow the scope\n    of the communications provision to cover only those who facilitate a\n    felony. Yet, under the Government\u2019s reading of \u00a7843(b), in a substan\n    tial number of cases Congress would for all practical purposes simul\n    taneously have graded back up to felony status with the left hand the\n    same offense, simple drug possession, it had dropped to a misde\n    meanor with the right. Given that Congress used no language spell\n    ing out a purpose so improbable, but legislated against a background\n    usage of terms such as \u201caid,\u201d \u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d that points in the\n    opposite direction and accords with the CSA\u2019s choice to classify small\n    purchases as misdemeanors, the Government\u2019s position is just too\n    unlikely.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 26, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) makes it a felony\n\u201cto use any communication facility in committing or in\ncausing or facilitating\u201d certain felonies prohibited by the\nstatute. 84 Stat. 1263, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7843(b). The question\nhere is whether someone violates \u00a7843(b) in making a\nmisdemeanor drug purchase because his phone call to the\ndealer can be said to facilitate the felony of drug distribu\ntion. The answer is no.\n                               I\n   FBI agents believed Mohammed Said was selling co\ncaine and got a warrant to tap his cell phone. In the\ncourse of listening in, they recorded six calls between Said\nand petitioner Salman Khade Abuelhawa, during which\nAbuelhawa arranged to buy cocaine from Said in two\nseparate transactions, each time a single gram. Abuel\nhawa\u2019s two purchases were misdemeanors, \u00a7844, while\nSaid\u2019s two sales were felonies, \u00a7841(a)(1) and (b). The\nGovernment nonetheless charged Abuelhawa with six\nfelonies on the theory that each of the phone calls,\nwhether placed by Abuelhawa or by Said, had been made\n2                 ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cin causing or facilitating\u201d Said\u2019s felonies, in violation of\n\u00a7843(b).1 Abuelhawa moved for acquittal as a matter of\nlaw, arguing that his efforts to commit the misdemeanors\nof buying cocaine could not be treated as causing or facili\ntating Said\u2019s felonies, but the District Court denied his\nmotion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a\u201325a, and the jury con\nvicted him on all six felony counts.\n  Abuelhawa argued the same point to the Court of Ap\npeals for the Fourth Circuit, with as much success. The\nCircuit reasoned that \u201cfor purposes of \u00a7843(b), \u2018facilitate\u2019\nshould be given its \u2018common meaning\u2014to make easier or\nless difficult, or to assist or aid.\u2019 \u201d 523 F. 3d 415, 420\n(2008) (quoting United States v. Lozano, 839 F. 2d 1020,\n1023 (CA4 1988)). The court said Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a\nphone to buy cocaine counted as ordinary facilitation\nbecause it \u201cundoubtedly made Said\u2019s cocaine distribution\neasier; in fact, \u2018it made the sale possible.\u2019 \u201d 523 F. 3d, at\n421 (quoting United States v. Binkley, 903 F. 2d 1130,\n1136 (CA7 1990) (emphasis deleted)). We granted certio\nrari, 555 U.

For purposes of this subsection, the term \u2018com\nmunication facility\u2019 means any and all public and private instrumen\ntalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals,\npictures, or sounds of all kinds and includes mail, telephone, wire,\nradio, and all other means of communication.\u201d\n  Section 843(d) provides, subject to exceptions not at issue here, that\n\u201cany person who violates this section shall be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of not more than 4 years, a fine . . . , or both.\u201d\n  2 Compare, e.g., United States v.

And of\ncourse on the literal plane, the phone calls could be de\nscribed as \u201cfacilitating\u201d drug distribution; they \u201cundoubt\nedly made . . . distribution easier.\u201d 523 F. 3d, at 421. But\nstopping there would ignore the rule that, because stat\nutes are not read as a collection of isolated phrases, see\nUnited States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents\nof America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993), \u201c[a] word in a\nstatute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its\ndefinitional possibilities,\u201d Dolan v. Postal Service, 546\nU. S. 481, 486 (2006). We think the word here does not.\n  To begin with, the Government\u2019s literal sweep of \u201cfacili\ntate\u201d sits uncomfortably with common usage. Where a\ntransaction like a sale necessarily presupposes two parties\nwith specific roles, it would be odd to speak of one party as\nfacilitating the conduct of the other. A buyer does not just\nmake a sale easier; he makes the sale possible. No buyer,\nno sale; the buyer\u2019s part is already implied by the term\n\u201csale,\u201d and the word \u201cfacilitate\u201d adds nothing. We would\nnot say that the borrower facilitates the bank loan.\n  The Government, however, replies that using the in\nstrument of communication under \u00a7843(b) is different from\nborrowing the money or merely handing over the sale\nprice for cocaine. Drugs can be sold without anyone\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1098 (CA10 1989) (buyer\u2019s use of phone in purchasing drugs does not\nfacilitate seller\u2019s drug distribution); United States v. Martin, 599 F. 2d\n880, 888\u2013889 (CA9 1979) (same), overruled on other grounds, United\nStates v. De Bright, 730 F. 2d 1255 (CA9 1984).\n4              ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmailing a letter or using a cell phone. Because cell\nphones, say, really do make it easier for dealers to break\nthe law, Congress probably meant to ratchet up the culpa\nbility of the buyer who calls ahead. But we think that\nargument comes up short against several more reasons\nthat count against the Government\u2019s position.\n    The common usage that limits \u201cfacilitate\u201d to the efforts\nof someone other than a primary or necessary actor in the\ncommission of a substantive crime has its parallel in the\ndecided cases. The traditional law is that where a statute\ntreats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently,\nadding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitat\ning the action by the other would upend the calibration of\npunishment set by the legislature, a line of reasoning\nexemplified in the courts\u2019 consistent refusal to treat non\ncriminal liquor purchases as falling under the prohibition\nagainst aiding or abetting the illegal sale of alcohol.

And this Court followed the same course in\nrejecting the broadest possible reading of a similar provi\nsion in Gebardi v. United States, 287 U. S. 112 (1932).\nThe question there was whether a woman who voluntarily\ncrossed a state line with a man to engage in \u201cillicit sexual\nrelations\u201d could be tagged with \u201caid[ing] or assist[ing] in\n. . . transporting, in interstate or foreign commerce . . . any\nwoman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or of de\nbauchery, or for any other immoral purpose\u201d in violation of\nthe Mann Act, ch. 395, 36 Stat. 825. Gebardi, 287 U. S., at\n116\u2013118 (internal quotation marks omitted). Since the\nstatutory penalties were \u201cclearly directed against the acts\nof the transporter as distinguished from the consent of the\nsubject of the transportation,\u201d we refused to \u201cinfer that the\nmere acquiescence of the woman transported was intended\nto be condemned by the general language punishing those\nwho aid and assist the transporter, any more than it has\nbeen inferred that the purchaser of liquor was to be re\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngarded as an abettor of the illegal sale.\u201d Id., at 119 (foot\nnote omitted).\n   These cases do not strictly control the outcome of this\none, but we think they have a bearing here, in two ways.\nAs we have said many times, we presume legislatures act\nwith case law in mind, e.g., Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S.\n362, 380\u2013381, and n. 12 (2000), and we presume here that\nwhen Congress enacted \u00a7843(b), it was familiar with the\ntraditional judicial limitation on applying terms like \u201caid,\u201d\n\u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist.\u201d We thus think it likely that Congress\nhad comparable scope in mind when it used the term\n\u201cfacilitate,\u201d a word with equivalent meaning, compare\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 76 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201caid\nand abet\u201d as to \u201cfacilitate the commission of a crime\u201d) with\nid., at 627 (defining \u201cfacilitation\u201d as \u201c[t]he act or an in\nstance of aiding or helping; . . . the act of making it easier\nfor another person to commit a crime\u201d).\n   And applying the presumption is supported significantly\nby the fact that here, as in the earlier cases, any broader\nreading of \u201cfacilitate\u201d would for practical purposes skew\nthe congressional calibration of respective buyer-seller\npenalties. When the statute was enacted, the use of land\nlines in drug transactions was common, and in these days\nwhen everyone over the age of three seems to carry a cell\nphone, the Government\u2019s interpretation would skew the\ncalibration of penalties very substantially. The respect\nowed to that penalty calibration cannot be minimized.\nPrior to 1970, Congress punished the receipt, concealment,\npurchase, or sale of any narcotic drug as a felony, see 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7174 (1964 ed.) (repealed), and on top of that\nadded a minimum of two years, and up to five, for using a\ncommunication facility in committing, causing, or facilitat\ning, any drug \u201coffense,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71403 (1964 ed.). In\n1970, however, the CSA, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et\nseq., downgraded simple possession of a controlled sub\nstance to a misdemeanor, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a) (2006 ed.),\n6                 ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand simultaneously limited the communications provision\nto prohibiting only the facilitation of a drug \u201cfelony,\u201d\n\u00a7843(b). This history drives home what is already clear in\nthe current statutory text: Congress meant to treat pur\nchasing drugs for personal use more leniently than the\nfelony of distributing drugs, and to narrow the scope of the\ncommunications provision to cover only those who facili\ntate a drug felony. Yet, under the Government\u2019s reading\nof \u00a7843(b), in a substantial number of cases Congress\nwould for all practical purposes simultaneously have\ngraded back up to felony status with the left hand the\nsame offense it had dropped to a misdemeanor with the\nright. As the Government sees it, Abuelhawa\u2019s use of a\nphone in making two small drug purchases would subject\nhim, in fact, to six felony counts and a potential sentence\nof 24 years in prison, even though buying the same drugs\nminus the phone would have supported only two misde\nmeanor counts and two years of prison. Given the CSA\u2019s\ndistinction between simple possession and distribution,\nand the background history of these offenses, it is impos\nsible to believe that Congress intended \u201cfacilitating\u201d to\ncause that twelve-fold quantum leap in punishment for\nsimple drug possessors.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 TheGovernment\u2019s suggestion that a result like this is not anoma\nlous because a prosecutor could exercise his discretion to seek a lower\nsentence, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, simply begs the question. Of course,\nCongress legislates against a background assumption of prosecutorial\ndiscretion, but this tells us nothing about the boundaries of punishment\nwithin which Congress intended the discretion to be exercised; prosecu\ntorial discretion is not a reason for courts to give improbable breadth to\ncriminal statutes. And it ill behooves the Government to invoke discre\ntionary power in this case, with the prosecutor seeking a sentencing\npotential of 24 years when the primary offense is the purchase of two\nounces of cocaine. For that matter, see id., at 41\u201343 (concession by\nGovernment that current Department of Justice guidelines require\nindividual prosecutors who bring charges to charge the maximum crime\nsupported by the facts in a case).\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government suggests that this background usage\nand the 1970 choice to reduce culpability for possession is\nbeside the point because Congress sometimes incorporates\naggravating factors into the Criminal Code, and the phone\nuse here is just one of them; the Government mentions\npossession by a prior drug offender, a felony punishable by\nup to two years\u2019 imprisonment. And, for perspective, the\nGovernment points to unauthorized possession of fluni\ntrazepim, a drug used to incapacitate rape victims, which\nis punishable by imprisonment up to three years. Brief for\nUnited States 20. It would not be strange, the Govern\nment says, for Congress to \u201cdecid[e] to treat the use of a\ncommunication facility in a drug transaction as a signifi\ncant act warranting additional punishment\u201d because\n\u201c[t]oday\u2019s communication facilities . . . make illicit drug\ntransactions easier and more efficient . . . . [and] greatly\nreduce the risk that the participants will be detected while\nnegotiating a transaction.\u201d Id., at 23\u201324.\n   We are skeptical. There is no question that Congress\nintended \u00a7843(b) to impede illicit drug transactions by\npenalizing the use of communication devices in coordinat\ning illegal drug operations, and no doubt that its purpose\nwill be served regardless of the outcome in this case. But\nit does not follow that Congress also meant a first-time\nbuyer\u2019s phone calls to get two small quantities of drugs for\npersonal use to expose him to punishment 12 times more\nsevere than a purchase by a recidivist offender and 8\ntimes more severe than the unauthorized possession of a\ndrug used by rapists.4 To the contrary, Congress used no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Government does nothing for its own cause by noting that 21\n\nU. S. C. \u00a7856 makes it a felony to facilitate \u201cthe simple possession of\ndrugs by others by making available for use . . . a place for the purpose\nof unlawfully using a controlled substance\u201d even though the crime\nfacilitated may be a mere misdemeanor. Brief for United States 21\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). This shows that\nCongress knew how to be clear in punishing the facilitation of a mis\n8                 ABUELHAWA v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlanguage spelling out a purpose so improbable, but legis\nlated against a background usage of terms such as \u201caid,\u201d\n\u201cabet,\u201d and \u201cassist\u201d that points in the opposite direction\nand accords with the CSA\u2019s choice to classify small pur\nchases as misdemeanors. The Government\u2019s position is\njust too unlikely.5\n                            III\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndemeanor as a felony, and it only highlights Congress\u2019s decision to limit\n\u00a7843(b) to the facilitation of a \u201cfelony.\u201d\n   5 The Government asks us to affirm the Fourth Circuit on an alterna\n\ntive ground: that Abuelhawa used a communication facility \u201cin causing\u201d\nSaid\u2019s drug felony rather than \u201cin . . . facilitating\u201d the felony. But the\nGovernment\u2019s argument on this point takes the same form as its\nargument about the term \u201cfacilitate,\u201d and the reasons that lead us to\nreject the one argument apply just as well to the other.\n</pre>",
