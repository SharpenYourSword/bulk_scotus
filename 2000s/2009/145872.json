DROWN ET AL.\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF NEW YORK\n\n   No. 07\u201310374.       Argued December 3, 2008\u2014Decided May 26, 2009\nBelieving that damages suits filed by prisoners against state correction\n  officers were largely frivolous and vexatious, New York passed Cor\n  rection Law \u00a724, which divested state courts of general jurisdiction of\n  their jurisdiction over such suits, including those filed under 42\n  U. S. C. \u00a71983, and replaced those claims with the State\u2019s preferred\n  alternative. Thereunder, a prisoner will have his claim against a cor\n  rection officer dismissed for want of jurisdiction and will be left to\n  pursue a damages claim against the State in the Court of Claims, a\n  court of limited jurisdiction in which the prisoner will not be entitled\n  to attorney\u2019s fees, punitive damages, or injunctive relief. Petitioner\n  filed two \u00a71983 damages actions against correction employees in\n  state court. Finding that it lacked jurisdiction under Correction Law\n  \u00a724, the trial court dismissed the actions. Affirming, the State Court\n  of Appeals rejected petitioner\u2019s claim that the state statute\u2019s jurisdic\n  tional limitation violated the Supremacy Clause. It reasoned that be\n  cause that law treats state and federal damages actions against cor\n  rection officers equally\u2014i.e., neither can be brought in New York\n  courts\u2014it was a neutral rule of judicial administration and thus a\n  valid excuse for the State\u2019s refusal to entertain the federal cause of\n  action.\nHeld: Correction Law \u00a724, as applied to \u00a71983 claims, violates the Su\n premacy Clause. Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (a) Federal and state law \u201ctogether form one system of jurispru\n dence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State; and the\n courts of the two jurisdictions are . . . courts of the same country, hav\n ing jurisdiction partly different and partly concurrent.\u201d Claflin v.\n Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136\u2013137. Both state and federal courts\n have jurisdiction over \u00a71983 suits. So strong is the presumption of\n concurrency that it is defeated only when Congress expressly ousts\n2                         HAYWOOD v.

Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 372.\n    As to whether a state law qualifies as such a neutral rule, States re\n    tain substantial leeway to establish the contours of their judicial sys\n    tems, but lack authority to nullify a federal right or cause of action\n    they believe is inconsistent with their local policies. Whatever its\n    merits, New York\u2019s policy of shielding correction officers from liability\n    when sued for damages arising out of conduct performed in the scope\n    of their employment is contrary to Congress\u2019 judgment that all per\n    sons who violate federal rights while acting under color of state law\n    shall be held liable for damages. \u201cA State may not . . . relieve conges\n    tion in its courts by declaring a whole category of federal claims to be\n    frivolous.\u201d Id., at 380. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) The New York Court of Appeals\u2019 holding was based on the mis\n    understanding that Correction Law \u00a724\u2019s equal treatment of federal\n    and state claims would guarantee that the statute would pass consti\n    tutional muster. Although the absence of discrimination is essential\n    to this Court\u2019s finding a state law neutral, nondiscrimination alone is\n    not sufficient to guarantee that a state law will be deemed neutral.\n    In addition to this misplaced reliance on equality, respondents mis\n    takenly treat this case as implicating the \u201cgreat latitude [States en\n    joy] to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\u201d\n    Howlett, 496 U. S., at 372. However, this Court need not decide\n    whether Congress can compel a State to offer a forum, otherwise un\n    available under state law, to hear \u00a71983 suits, because New York has\n    courts of general jurisdiction that routinely sit to hear analogous\n    \u00a71983 actions.

S. C. \u00a71983, the statute that creates a remedy\nfor violations of federal rights committed by persons acting\nunder color of state law.1 While that rule is generally\napplicable to New York\u2019s supreme courts\u2014the State\u2019s trial\ncourts of general jurisdiction\u2014New York\u2019s Correction Law\n\u00a724 divests those courts of jurisdiction over \u00a71983 suits\nthat seek money damages from correction officers. New\nYork thus prohibits the trial courts that generally exercise\njurisdiction over \u00a71983 suits brought against other state\nofficials from hearing virtually all such suits brought\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, as\n\namended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, provides in relevant part:\n  \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,\ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,\nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or\nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any\nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,\nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or\nother proper proceeding for redress.\u201d\n2                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst state correction officers. The question presented is\nwhether that exceptional treatment of a limited category of\n\u00a71983 claims is consistent with the Supremacy Clause of\nthe United States Constitution. 2\n                              I\n   Petitioner, an inmate in New York\u2019s Attica Correctional\nFacility, commenced two \u00a71983 actions against several\ncorrection employees alleging that they violated his civil\nrights in connection with three prisoner disciplinary pro\nceedings and an altercation. Proceeding pro se, petitioner\nfiled his claims in State Supreme Court and sought puni\ntive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court dis\nmissed the actions on the ground that, under N. Y. Cor\nrect. Law Ann. \u00a724 (West 1987) (hereinafter Correction\nLaw \u00a724), it lacked jurisdiction to entertain any suit aris\ning under state or federal law seeking money damages\nfrom correction officers for actions taken in the scope of\ntheir employment.      The intermediate appellate court\nsummarily affirmed the trial court. 35 App. Div. 3d 1290,\n826 N. Y. S. 2d 542 (2006).\n   The New York Court of Appeals, by a 4-to-3 vote, also\naffirmed the dismissal of petitioner\u2019s damages action. The\nCourt of Appeals rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that Cor\nrection Law \u00a724\u2019s jurisdictional limitation interfered with\n\u00a71983 and therefore ran afoul of the Supremacy Clause of\nthe United States Constitution. The majority reasoned\nthat, because Correction Law \u00a724 treats state and federal\ndamages actions against correction officers equally (that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n       Supremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2, provides:\n  \u201cThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be\nmade in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be\nmade, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme\nLaw of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\nany Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary\nnotwithstanding.\u201d\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nis, neither can be brought in New York courts), the statute\nshould be properly characterized as a \u201cneutral state rule\nregarding the administration of the courts\u201d and therefore\na \u201cvalid excuse\u201d for the State\u2019s refusal to entertain the\nfederal cause of action. 9 N. Y. 3d 481, 487, 881 N. E. 2d\n180, 183, 184 (2007) (quoting Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S.\n356, 369, 372 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThe majority understood our Supremacy Clause prece\ndents to set forth the general rule that so long as a State\ndoes not refuse to hear a federal claim for the \u201csole reason\nthat the cause of action arises under federal law,\u201d its\nwithdrawal of jurisdiction will be deemed constitutional.\n9 N. Y. 3d, at 488, 881 N. E. 2d, at 184. So read, discrimi\nnation vel non is the focal point of Supremacy Clause\nanalysis.\n   In dissent, Judge Jones argued that Correction Law \u00a724\nis not a neutral rule of judicial administration. Noting\nthat the State\u2019s trial courts handle all other \u00a71983 dam\nages actions, he concluded that the State had created\ncourts of competent jurisdiction to entertain \u00a71983 suits.\nIn his view, \u201conce a state opens its courts to hear section\n1983 actions, it may not selectively exclude section 1983\nactions by denominating state policies as jurisdictional.\u201d\nId., at 497, 881 N. E. 2d, at 191.\n   Recognizing the importance of the question decided by\nthe New York Court of Appeals, we granted certiorari.\n554 U. S. ___ (2008). We now reverse.\n                             II\n  Motivated by the belief that damages suits filed by\nprisoners against state correction officers were by and\nlarge frivolous and vexatious, New York passed Correction\nLaw \u00a724.3 The statute employs a two-step process to strip\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The New York Attorney General described Correction Law \u00a724 as\n\n\u201cfurther[ing] New York\u2019s legitimate interest in minimizing the disrup\ntive effect of prisoner damages claims against correction employees,\n4                       HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nits courts of jurisdiction over such damages claims and to\nreplace those claims with the State\u2019s preferred alternative.\nThe provision states in full:\n       \u201c1. No civil action shall be brought in any court of\n     the state, except by the attorney general on behalf of\n     the state, against any officer or employee of the de\n     partment, in his personal capacity, for damages aris\n     ing out of any act done or the failure to perform any\n     act within the scope of employment and in the dis\n     charge of the duties by such officer or employee.\n       \u201c2. Any claim for damages arising out of any act\n     done or the failure to perform any act within the scope\n     of employment and in the discharge of the duties of\n     any officer or employee of the department shall be\n     brought and maintained in the court of claims as a\n     claim against the state.\u201d\nThus, under this scheme, a prisoner seeking damages from\na correction officer will have his claim dismissed for want\nof jurisdiction and will be left, instead, to pursue a claim\nfor damages against an entirely different party (the State)\nin the Court of Claims\u2014a court of limited jurisdiction.4\nSee N. Y. Const., Art. VI, \u00a79; N. Y. Ct. Clms. Law Ann. \u00a79\n(West 1989) (hereinafter Court of Claims Act).\n  For prisoners seeking redress, pursuing the Court of\nClaims alternative comes with strict conditions. In addi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmany of which are frivolous and vexatious.\u201d Brief in Opposition 10; see\nalso Artega v. State, 72 N. Y. 2d 212, 219, 527 N. E. 2d 1194, 1198\n(1988) (\u201cIn carrying out their duties relating to security and discipline\nin the difficult and sometimes highly stressful prison environment,\ncorrection employees . . . should not be inhibited because their conduct\ncould be the basis of a damage claim\u201d).\n  4 Although the State has waived its sovereign immunity from liability\n\nby allowing itself to be sued in the Court of Claims, a plaintiff seeking\ndamages against the State in that court cannot use \u00a71983 as a vehicle\nfor redress because a State is not a \u201cperson\u201d under \u00a71983.

Specifically, under\nNew York law, plaintiffs in the Court of Claims must\ncomply with a 90-day notice requirement, Court of Claims\nAct \u00a79; are not entitled to a jury trial, \u00a712; have no right to\nattorney\u2019s fees, \u00a727; and may not seek punitive damages or\ninjunctive relief, Sharapata v. Town of Islip, 56 N. Y. 2d\n332, 334, 437 N. E. 2d 1104, 1105 (1982).\n   We must decide whether Correction Law \u00a724, as applied\nto \u00a71983 claims, violates the Supremacy Clause.\n                             III\n   This Court has long made clear that federal law is as\nmuch the law of the several States as are the laws passed\nby their legislatures. Federal and state law \u201ctogether form\none system of jurisprudence, which constitutes the law of\nthe land for the State; and the courts of the two jurisdic\ntions are not foreign to each other, nor to be treated by\neach other as such, but as courts of the same country,\nhaving jurisdiction partly different and partly concurrent.\u201d\nClaflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136\u2013137 (1876); see\nMinneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211,\n222 (1916); The Federalist No. 82, p. 132 (E. Bourne ed.\n1947) (A. Hamilton) (\u201c[T]he inference seems to be conclu\nsive, that the State courts would have a concurrent juris\ndiction in all cases arising under the laws of the Union,\nwhere it was not expressly prohibited\u201d). Although \u00a71983,\na Reconstruction-era statute, was passed \u201cto interpose the\nfederal courts between the States and the people, as\nguardians of the people\u2019s federal rights,\u201d Mitchum v. Fos\nter, 407 U. S. 225, 242 (1972), state courts as well as fed\neral courts are entrusted with providing a forum for the\nvindication of federal rights violated by state or local\nofficials acting under color of state law. See Patsy v.\n6                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBoard of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 506\u2013507 (1982)\n(canvassing the legislative debates of the 1871 Congress\nand noting that \u201cmany legislators interpreted [\u00a71983] to\nprovide dual or concurrent forums in the state and federal\nsystem, enabling the plaintiff to choose the forum in which\nto seek relief\u201d); Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 3, n. 1\n(1980).\n   So strong is the presumption of concurrency that it is\ndefeated only in two narrowly defined circumstances: first,\nwhen Congress expressly ousts state courts of jurisdiction,\nsee Bombolis, 241 U. S., at 221; Claflin, 93 U. S., at 136;\nand second, \u201c[w]hen a state court refuses jurisdiction\nbecause of a neutral state rule regarding the administra\ntion of the courts,\u201d Howlett, 496 U. S., at 372. Focusing on\nthe latter circumstance, we have emphasized that only a\nneutral jurisdictional rule will be deemed a \u201cvalid excuse\u201d\nfor departing from the default assumption that \u201cstate\ncourts have inherent authority, and are thus presump\ntively competent, to adjudicate claims arising under the\nlaws of the United States.\u201d Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455,\n458 (1990).\n   In determining whether a state law qualifies as a neu\ntral rule of judicial administration, our cases have estab\nlished that a State cannot employ a jurisdictional rule \u201cto\ndissociate [itself] from federal law because of disagreement\nwith its content or a refusal to recognize the superior\nauthority of its source.\u201d Howlett, 496 U. S., at 371. In\nother words, although States retain substantial leeway to\nestablish the contours of their judicial systems, they lack\nauthority to nullify a federal right or cause of action they\nbelieve is inconsistent with their local policies. \u201cThe sug\ngestion that [an] act of Congress is not in harmony with\nthe policy of the State, and therefore that the courts of the\nState are free to decline jurisdiction, is quite inadmissible,\nbecause it presupposes what in legal contemplation does\nnot exist.\u201d Second Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1,\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

In passing Correction\nLaw \u00a724, New York made the judgment that correction\nofficers should not be burdened with suits for damages\narising out of conduct performed in the scope of their\nemployment. Because it regards these suits as too numer\nous or too frivolous (or both), the State\u2019s longstanding\npolicy has been to shield this narrow class of defendants\nfrom liability when sued for damages.5 The State\u2019s policy,\nwhatever its merits, is contrary to Congress\u2019 judgment\nthat all persons who violate federal rights while acting\nunder color of state law shall be held liable for damages.\nAs we have unanimously recognized, \u201c[a] State may not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 In many respects, Correction Law \u00a724 operates more as an immu\nnity-from-damages provision than as a jurisdictional rule. Indeed, the\noriginal version of the statute gave correction officers qualified immu\nnity, providing that no officer would be \u201cliable for damages if he shall\nhave acted in good faith, with reasonable care and upon probable\ncause.\u201d N. Y. Correct. Law. \u00a76\u2013b (McKinney Supp. 1947). And, more\nrecently, a state legislative proposal seeking to extend Correction Law\n\u00a724\u2019s scheme to other state employees explained that its purpose was to\ngrant \u201cthe same immunity from civil damage actions as all other State\nemployees who work in the prisons.\u201d App. 85.\n  In Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356 (1990), we considered the question\nwhether a Florida school board could assert a state-law immunity\ndefense in a \u00a71983 action brought in state court when the defense\nwould not have been available if the action had been brought in federal\ncourt. We unanimously held that the State\u2019s decision to extend immu\nnity \u201cover and above [that which is] already provided in \u00a71983 . . .\ndirectly violates federal law,\u201d and explained that the \u201celements of, and\nthe defenses to, a federal cause of action are defined by federal law.\u201d\nId., at 375; Owen v.

Thus, if Correction Law \u00a724 were understood as\noffering an immunity defense, Howlett would compel the conclusion\nthat it violates the Supremacy Clause.\n8                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . relieve congestion in its courts by declaring a whole\ncategory of federal claims to be frivolous. Until it has been\nproved that the claim has no merit, that judgment is not\nup to the States to make.\u201d Howlett, 496 U. S., at 380;\nBurnett v. Grattan, 468 U. S. 42, 55 (1984) (rejecting as\n\u201cmanifestly inconsistent with the central objective of the\nReconstruction\u2013Era civil rights statutes\u201d the judgment\n\u201cthat factors such as minimizing the diversion of state\nofficials\u2019 attention from their duties outweigh the interest\nin providing employees ready access to a forum to resolve\nvalid claims\u201d). That New York strongly favors a rule\nshielding correction officers from personal damages liabil\nity and substituting the State as the party responsible for\ncompensating individual victims is irrelevant. The State\ncannot condition its enforcement of federal law on the\ndemand that those individuals whose conduct federal law\nseeks to regulate must nevertheless escape liability.\n                             IV\n   While our cases have uniformly applied the principle\nthat a State cannot simply refuse to entertain a federal\nclaim based on a policy disagreement, we have yet to\nconfront a statute like New York\u2019s that registers its dis\nsent by divesting its courts of jurisdiction over a disfa\nvored federal claim in addition to an identical state claim.\nThe New York Court of Appeals\u2019 holding was based on the\nmisunderstanding that this equal treatment of federal\nand state claims rendered Correction Law \u00a724 constitu\ntional. 9 N. Y. 3d, at 489, 881 N. E. 2d, at 185 (\u201cPut sim\nply, because Correction Law \u00a724 does not treat section\n1983 claims differently than it treats related state law\ncauses of action, the Supremacy Clause is not offended\u201d).\nTo the extent our cases have created this misperception,\nwe now make clear that equality of treatment does not\nensure that a state law will be deemed a neutral rule of\njudicial administration and therefore a valid excuse for\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrefusing to entertain a federal cause of action.\n  Respondents correctly observe that, in the handful of\ncases in which this Court has found a valid excuse, the\nstate rule at issue treated state and federal claims\nequally. In Douglas v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279\nU. S. 377 (1929), we upheld a state law that granted state\ncourts discretion to decline jurisdiction over state and\nfederal claims alike when neither party was a resident of\nthe State. Later, in Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117 (1945),\na city court dismissed an action brought under the Federal\nEmployers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. \u00a751 et seq.,\nfor want of jurisdiction because the cause of action arose\noutside the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. We upheld the\ndismissal on the ground that the State\u2019s venue laws were\nnot being applied in a way that discriminated against the\nfederal claim. 324 U. S., at 123. In a third case, Missouri\nex rel. Southern R. Co. v. Mayfield, 340 U. S. 1 (1950), we\nheld that a State\u2019s application of the forum non conveniens\ndoctrine to bar adjudication of a FELA case brought by\nnonresidents was constitutionally sound as long as the\npolicy was enforced impartially. Id., at 4. And our most\nrecent decision finding a valid excuse, Johnson v. Fankell,\n520 U. S. 911 (1997), rested largely on the fact that\nIdaho\u2019s rule limiting interlocutory jurisdiction did not\ndiscriminate against \u00a71983 actions. See id., at 918.\n  Although the absence of discrimination is necessary to\nour finding a state law neutral, it is not sufficient. A\njurisdictional rule cannot be used as a device to undermine\nfederal law, no matter how evenhanded it may appear. As\nwe made clear in Howlett, \u201c[t]he fact that a rule is de\nnominated jurisdictional does not provide a court an ex\ncuse to avoid the obligation to enforce federal law if the\nrule does not reflect the concerns of power over the person\nand competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional\nrules are designed to protect.\u201d 496 U. S., at 381. Ensuring\nequality of treatment is thus the beginning, not the end, of\n10                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Supremacy Clause analysis.\n   In addition to giving too much weight to equality of\ntreatment, respondents mistakenly treat this case as\nimplicating the \u201cgreat latitude [States enjoy] to establish\nthe structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\u201d Id., at\n372. Although Correction Law \u00a724 denies state courts\nauthority to entertain damages actions against correction\nofficers, this case does not require us to decide whether\nCongress may compel a State to offer a forum, otherwise\nunavailable under state law, to hear suits brought pursu\nant to \u00a71983. The State of New York has made this in\nquiry unnecessary by creating courts of general jurisdic\ntion that routinely sit to hear analogous \u00a71983 actions.\nNew York\u2019s constitution vests the state supreme courts\nwith general original jurisdiction, N. Y. Const., Art. VI,\n\u00a77(a), and the \u201cinviolate authority to hear and resolve all\ncauses in law and equity.\u201d Pollicina v. Misericordia Hos\npital Medical Center, 82 N. Y. 2d 332, 339, 624 N. E. 2d\n974, 977 (1993). For instance, if petitioner had attempted\nto sue a police officer for damages under \u00a71983, the suit\nwould be properly adjudicated by a state supreme court.\nSimilarly, if petitioner had sought declaratory or injunc\ntive relief against a correction officer, that suit would be\nheard in a state supreme court. It is only a particular\nspecies of suits\u2014those seeking damages relief against\ncorrection officers\u2014that the State deems inappropriate for\nits trial courts.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 While we have looked to a State\u2019s \u201ccommon-law tort analogues\u201d in\n\ndeciding whether a state procedural rule is neutral, see Felder v. Casey,\n487 U. S. 131, 146, n. 3 (1988), we have never equated \u201canalogous\nclaims\u201d with \u201cidentical claims.\u201d Instead, we have searched for a similar\nclaim under state law to determine whether a State has established\ncourts of adequate and appropriate jurisdiction capable of hearing a\n\u00a71983 suit. See Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 388, 394 (1947); Martinez\nv. California, 444 U. S. 277, 283\u2013284, n. 7 (1980) (\u201c[W]here the same\ntype of claim, if arising under state law, would be enforced in the state\ncourts, the state courts are generally not free to refuse enforcement of\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  We therefore hold that, having made the decision to\ncreate courts of general jurisdiction that regularly sit to\nentertain analogous suits, New York is not at liberty to\nshut the courthouse door to federal claims that it considers\nat odds with its local policy.7 A State\u2019s authority to organ\nize its courts, while considerable, remains subject to the\nstrictures of the Constitution. See, e.g., McKnett v.\nSt. Louis & San Francisco R. Co., 292 U. S. 230, 233\n(1934). We have never treated a State\u2019s invocation of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe federal claim\u201d (emphasis added)). Section 1983 damages claims\nagainst other state officials and equitable claims against correction\nofficers are both sufficiently analogous to petitioner\u2019s \u00a71983 claims.\n   7 The dissent\u2019s contrary view is based on its belief that \u201cStates have\n\nunfettered authority to determine whether their local courts may\nentertain a federal cause of action.\u201d Post, at 8 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\nBut this theory of the Supremacy Clause was raised and squarely\nrejected in Howlett. Respondents in that case \u201cargued that a federal\ncourt has no power to compel a state court to entertain a claim over\nwhich the state court has no jurisdiction as a matter of state law.\u201d 496\nU. S., at 381; see also Brief for National Association of Counties et al.\nas Amici Curiae in Howlett v. Rose, O. T. 1989, No. 89\u20135383, pp. 11\u201313\n(\u201c[S]tate courts are under no obligation to disregard even-handed\njurisdictional limitations that exclude both state and federal claims\u201d).\nWe declared that this argument had \u201cno merit\u201d and explained that it\nignored other provisions of the Constitution, including the Full Faith\nand Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which\ncompel States to open their courts to causes of action over which they\nwould normally lack jurisdiction. See 496 U. S., at 381\u2013382; see also\nHughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609, 611 (1951) (interpreting the Full Faith\nand Credit Clause and concluding that a State cannot \u201cescape [its]\nconstitutional obligation to enforce the rights and duties validly created\nunder the laws of other states by the simple device of removing jurisdic\ntion from courts otherwise competent\u201d); Angel v. Bullington, 330 U. S.\n183, 188 (1947) (noting that the Constitution may \u201cfetter the freedom of\na State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such\nwithdrawal of jurisdiction \u2018the adjective law of the State\u2019, or the exer\ncise of its right to regulate \u2018the practice and procedure\u2019 of its courts\u201d).\nWe saw no reason to treat the Supremacy Clause differently. Howlett,\n496 U. S., at 382\u2013383. Thus, to the extent the dissent resurrects this\nargument, we again reject it.\n12                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d as a trump that ends the Supremacy Clause\ninquiry, see Howlett, 496 U. S., at 382\u2013383, and we decline\nto do so in this case. Because New York\u2019s supreme courts\ngenerally have personal jurisdiction over the parties in\n\u00a71983 suits brought by prisoners against correction offi\ncers and because they hear the lion\u2019s share of all other\n\u00a71983 actions, we find little concerning \u201cpower over the\nperson and competence over the subject matter\u201d in Correc\ntion Law \u00a724. Id., at 381; see id., at 378 (conducting a\nsimilar analysis and concluding that the Florida courts of\ngeneral jurisdiction were \u201cfully competent to provide the\nremedies [\u00a71983] requires\u201d).8\n   Accordingly, the dissent\u2019s fear that \u201cno state jurisdic\ntional rule will be upheld as constitutional\u201d is entirely\nunfounded. Post, at 29, n. 10. Our holding addresses only\nthe unique scheme adopted by the State of New York\u2014a\nlaw designed to shield a particular class of defendants\n(correction officers) from a particular type of liability\n(damages) brought by a particular class of plaintiffs (pris\noners). Based on the belief that damages suits against\ncorrection officers are frivolous and vexatious, see supra,\nat 3\u20134, n. 3, Correction Law \u00a724 is effectively an immu\nnity statute cloaked in jurisdictional garb. Finding this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The  dissent\u2019s proposed solution would create a blind spot in the Su\npremacy Clause. If New York had decided to employ a procedural rule\nto burden the enforcement of federal law, the dissent would find the\nscheme unconstitutional. Yet simply because New York has decided to\nimpose an even greater burden on a federal cause of action by selectively\nwithdrawing the jurisdiction of its courts, the dissent detects no consti\ntutional violation. Thus, in the dissent\u2019s conception of the Supremacy\nClause, a State could express its disagreement with (and even open\nhostility to) a federal cause of action, declare a desire to thwart its\nenforcement, and achieve that goal by removing the disfavored category\nof claims from its courts\u2019 jurisdiction. If this view were adopted, the\nlesson of our precedents would be that other States with unconstitution\nally burdensome procedural rules did not go far enough \u201cto avoid the\nobligation to enforce federal law.\u201d Howlett, 469 U.

Article III, \u00a71,\nprovides that \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United States,\nshall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior\nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and\nestablish.\u201d The history of the drafting and ratification of\nthis Article establishes that it leaves untouched the\nStates\u2019 plenary authority to decide whether their local\ncourts will have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal\ncauses of action.\n2                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The text of Article III reflects the Framers\u2019 agreement\nthat the National Government needed a Supreme Court.\nThere was sharp disagreement at the Philadelphia Con\u00ad\nvention, however, over the need for lower federal courts.\nSeveral of the Framers, most notably James Madison,\nfavored a strong central government that included lower\nfederal tribunals. Under the Virginia Plan, the Constitu\u00ad\ntion would have established a \u201cNational Judiciary . . . to\nconsist of one or more supreme tribunals, and of inferior\ntribunals to be chosen by the National Legislature.\u201d 1\nRecords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 21 (M. Far\u00ad\nrand ed. 1911) (hereinafter Farrand). A revised version of\nthe proposal, which stated that the National Judiciary\nwould \u201c \u2018consist of One supreme tribunal, and of one or\nmore inferior tribunals,\u2019 \u201d was approved on June 4, 1787.\nId., at 95.\n   The following day, however, John Rutledge raised an\nobjection to \u201cestablishing any national tribunal except a\nsingle supreme one.\u201d Id., at 119. He proposed striking the\nlanguage providing for the creation of lower federal courts\nbecause state courts were \u201cmost proper\u201d for deciding \u201call\ncases in the first instance.\u201d Ibid. According to Rutledge,\n\u201cthe right of appeal to the supreme national tribunal [was]\nsufficient to secure the national rights [and] uniformity of\nJudgm[en]ts,\u201d and the lower federal courts were thus an\n\u201cunnecessary encroachment\u201d on the sovereign prerogative\nof the States to adjudicate federal claims. Id., at 124.\nMadison nonetheless defended the Virginia Plan. He\ncountered that \u201cinferior [federal] tribunals . . . dispersed\nthroughout the Republic\u201d were necessary to meet the\nneeds of the newly formed government: \u201cAn effective\nJudiciary establishment commensurate to the legislative\nauthority [is] essential. A Government without a proper\nExecutive [and] Judiciary would be the mere trunk of a\nbody without arms or legs to act or move.\u201d Ibid.

This version moder\u00ad\nated the original Virginia Plan because of the \u201cdistinction\nbetween establishing such tribunals absolutely, and giving\na discretion to the Legislature to establish or not establish\n[inferior federal courts].\u201d Ibid. Over continued objections\nthat such courts were an unnecessary expense and an\naffront to the States, the scaled-back version of the Vir\u00ad\nginia Plan passed. Ibid.\n   On June 15, 1787, however, the New Jersey Plan was\nintroduced. Although it did not directly challenge the\ndecision to permit Congress to \u201cinstitute\u201d inferior federal\ncourts, the plan, among other things, required state courts\nto adjudicate federal claims. Id., at 125, 243. In particu\u00ad\nlar, the plan provided that, except for cases of impeach\u00ad\nment (over which the Supreme Court would have original\njurisdiction), \u201call punishments, fines, forfeitures [and]\npenalties . . . shall be adjudged by the Common law Judi\u00ad\nciar[ies] of the State in which any offence contrary to the\ntrue intent [and] meaning of [federal law] shall have been\ncommitted or perpetrated, with liberty of commencing in\nthe first instance all suits [and] prosecutions for that\npurpose in the superior Common law Judiciary in such\nState, subject nevertheless, for the correction of all errors,\nboth in law [and] fact in rendering judgment, to an appeal\nto the Judiciary of the U[nited] States.\u201d Id., at 243, 244.\n   The introduction of the New Jersey Plan reignited the\ndebate over the need for lower federal courts. In light of\nthe plan\u2019s provision for mandatory state-court jurisdiction\nover federal claims, Pierce Butler \u201ccould see no necessity\nfor such tribunals.\u201d 2 id., at 45.

Edmund Randolph bluntly\nargued that \u201cthe Courts of the States can not be trusted\nwith the administration of the National laws.\u201d Ibid.\nGeorge Mason suggested that, at the very least, \u201cmany\ncircumstances might arise not now to be foreseen, which\nmight render such a power absolutely necessary.\u201d Ibid.\nRoger Sherman also \u201cwas willing to give the power to the\nLegislature,\u201d even though he \u201cwished them to make use of\nthe State Tribunals whenever it could be done . . . with\nsafety to the general interest.\u201d Ibid.\n   At the conclusion of this debate, the New Jersey Plan,\nincluding its component requiring state-court considera\u00ad\ntion of federal claims, was defeated and the Madison-\nWilson proposal was delivered to the Committee of Detail,\nsee id., at 133. The Committee amended the proposal\u2019s\nlanguage to its current form in Article III, which gives\nCongress the power to \u201cordain and establish\u201d inferior\nfederal courts. See id., at 168. The delegates to the Con\u00ad\nstitutional Convention unanimously adopted this revised\nversion, see id., at 315, and it was ultimately ratified by\nthe States.\n   This so-called Madisonian Compromise bridged the\ndivide \u201cbetween those who thought that the establishment\nof lower federal courts should be constitutionally manda\u00ad\ntory and those who thought there should be no federal\ncourts at all except for a Supreme Court with, inter alia,\nappellate jurisdiction to review state court judgments.\u201d R.\nFallon, D.

See ante, at 5 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).\nHe merely understood that the States would be \u201cdivested of no part of\ntheir primitive jurisdiction\u201d and state courts \u201cin every case in which\nthey were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national\nlegislature . . . [would] of course take cognizance of the causes to which\nthose acts may give birth.\u201d The Federalist No. 82, at 132. Hamilton\nthus assumed that state courts would continue to entertain federal\nclaims consistent with their \u201cprimitive jurisdiction\u201d under state law.\nIbid. But he remained skeptical that state courts could be forced to\nentertain federal causes of action when state law deprived them of\njurisdiction over such claims. See Hamilton, The Examination No. 6,\n(Jan. 2, 1802), in 25 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 484, 487\u2013488 (H.\nSyrett ed. 1977) (\u201c[I]t is not to be forgotten, that the right to employ the\nagency of the State Courts for executing the laws of the Union, is liable\nto question, and has, in fact, been seriously questioned\u201d).\n6                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(\u201c \u2018[I]n judicial matters, the concurrent jurisdiction of the\nstate tribunals depends altogether upon the pleasure of\ncongress, and may be revoked and extinguished whenever\nthey think proper, in every case in which the subject mat\u00ad\nter can constitutionally be made cognizable in the federal\ncourts; and that, without an express provision to the con\u00ad\ntrary, the state courts will retain a concurrent jurisdiction\nin all cases where they had jurisdiction originally over the\nsubject matter\u201d (quoting 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on\nAmerican Law 374\u2013375 (1826) (hereinafter Kent))). As a\nresult, \u201cif exclusive jurisdiction [in the federal courts] be\nneither express nor implied, the State courts have concur\u00ad\nrent jurisdiction whenever, by their own constitution, they\nare competent to take it.\u201d Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S.\n130, 136 (1876).\n    The Constitution\u2019s implicit preservation of state author\u00ad\nity to entertain federal claims, however, did not impose a\nduty on state courts to do so. As discussed above, there\nwas at least one proposal to expressly require state courts\nto take original jurisdiction over federal claims (subject to\nappeal in federal court) that was introduced in an attempt\nto forestall the creation of lower federal courts. See supra,\nat 3\u20134. But in light of the failure of this proposal\u2014which\nwas offered before the adoption of the Madisonian Com\u00ad\npromise\u2014the assertions by its supporters that state courts\nwould ordinarily entertain federal causes of action cannot\nreasonably be viewed as an assurance that the States\nwould never alter the subject-matter jurisdiction of their\ncourts. The Framers\u2019 decision to empower Congress to\ncreate federal courts that could either supplement or\ndisplace state-court review of federal claims, as well as the\nexclusion of any affirmative command requiring the States\nto consider federal claims in the text of Article III, confirm\nthis understanding.

Great Works\nMilling & Mfg. Co., 17 F. Cas. 496, 499 (No. 9,662) (CCD\nMe. 1843) (Story, J.). In short, there was \u201ca very clear\nintimation given by the judges of the Supreme Court, that\nthe state courts were not bound in consequence of any act\nof congress, to assume and exercise jurisdiction in such\ncases. It was merely permitted to them to do so as far, as\nwas compatible with their state obligations.\u201d Kent 375;\nsee also id., at 377 (explaining that the Constitution \u201cper\u00ad\nmits state courts which are competent for the purpose, and\nhave an inherent jurisdiction adequate to the case, to\nentertain suits in the given cases\u201d).\n   Under our federal system, therefore, the States have\nunfettered authority to determine whether their local\ncourts may entertain a federal cause of action. Once a\nState exercises its sovereign prerogative to deprive its\ncourts of subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of\naction, it is the end of the matter as far as the Constitu\u00ad\ntion is concerned.\n   The present case can be resolved under this principle\nalone. New York Correction Law Annotated \u00a724, \u00b61 (West\n1987) (NYCLA) provides that \u201c[n]o civil action shall be\nbrought in any court of the state, except by the attorney\ngeneral on behalf of the state, against any officer or em\u00ad\nployee of the department, in his personal capacity, for\ndamages arising out of any act done or the failure to per\u00ad\nform any act within the scope of the employment and in\nthe discharge of the duties by such officer or employee.\u201d\nThe majority and petitioner agree that this statute erects\na jurisdictional bar that prevents the state courts from\nentertaining petitioner\u2019s claim for damages under \u00a71983.\nSee ante, at 4 (agreeing that \u201ca prisoner seeking damages\nfrom a correction officer will have his claim dismissed for\nwant of jurisdiction\u201d); Brief for Petitioner 21 (\u201cEvery New\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Because New York\u2019s\ndecision to withdraw jurisdiction over \u00a71983 damages\nactions\u2014or indeed, over any claims\u2014does not offend the\nConstitution, the judgment below should be affirmed.\n                             II\n   The Court has evaded Article III\u2019s limitations by finding\nthat the Supremacy Clause constrains the States\u2019 author\u00ad\nity to define the subject-matter jurisdiction of their own\ncourts. See ante, at 5\u20138. In particular, the Court has held\nthat \u201cthe Federal Constitution prohibits state courts of\ngeneral jurisdiction from refusing\u201d to entertain a federal\nclaim \u201csolely because the suit is brought under a federal\nlaw\u201d as a \u201cstate may not discriminate against rights aris\u00ad\ning under federal laws.\u201d McKnett v. St. Louis & San\nFrancisco R. Co., 292 U. S. 230, 233\u2013234 (1934). There is\nno textual or historical support for the Court\u2019s incorpora\u00ad\ntion of this antidiscrimination principle into the Suprem\u00ad\nacy Clause.\n                             A\n                             1\n   The Supremacy Clause provides that \u201c[t]his Constitu\u00ad\ntion, and the Laws of the United States which shall be\nmade in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme Law\nof the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound\nthereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any\nState to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d Art. VI, cl. 2.\nUnder this provision, \u201c[t]he laws of the United States are\nlaws in the several States, and just as much binding on\nthe citizens and courts thereof as the State laws are. . . .\nThe two together form one system of jurisprudence, which\nconstitutes the law of the land for the State.\u201d Claflin, 93\nU. S., at 136\u2013137; see also Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.\n452, 460 (1991); Robb v. Connolly, 111 U. S. 624, 637\n10                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(1884). Thus, a valid federal law is substantively superior\nto a state law; \u201cif a state measure conflicts with a federal\nrequirement, the state provision must give way.\u201d Swift &\nCo. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 120 (1965). As a textual\nmatter, however, the Supremacy Clause does not address\nwhether a state court must entertain a federal cause of\naction; it provides only a rule of decision that the state\ncourt must follow if it adjudicates the claim. See R. Ber\u00ad\nger, Congress v. The Supreme Court 245 (1969) (The\nSupremacy Clause only \u201c \u2018enacts what the law shall be\u2019. . . .\n[I]t defines the governing \u2018supreme law,\u2019 and if a State\ncourt has jurisdiction, it commands that that law shall\ngovern\u201d).\n   The Supremacy Clause\u2019s path to adoption at the Con\u00ad\nvention confirms this focus. Its precursor was introduced\nas part of the New Jersey Plan. See 1 Farrand 245 (\u201c[A]ll\nActs of . . . Cong[ress] made by virtue [and] in pursuance\nof the powers hereby . . . vested in them . . . shall be the\nsupreme law of the respective States so far forth as those\nActs . . . shall relate to the said States or their Citizens\u201d);\nibid. (\u201c[T]he Judiciary of the several States shall be bound\nthereby in their decisions, any thing in the respective laws\nof the Individual States . . . notwithstanding\u201d). But, as\nexplained above, see supra, at 3\u20134, the New Jersey Plan\nalso included an entirely separate provision that ad\u00ad\ndressed state-court jurisdiction, which would have re\u00ad\nquired all federal questions to \u201cb[e] determined in the first\ninstance in the courts of the respective states.\u201d 3 Farrand\n287. These two provisions of the New Jersey Plan worked\nin tandem to require state courts to entertain federal\nclaims and to decide the substantive dispute in favor of\nfederal law if a conflict between the two arose.\n   After the adoption of the Madisonian Compromise and\nthe defeat of the New Jersey Plan, the Framers returned\nto the question of federal supremacy. A proposal was\nintroduced granting Congress the power to \u201c \u2018negative all\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlaws passed by the several States (contravening in the\nopinion of [Congress] the articles of Union, or any treaties\nsubsisting under the authority of [Congress]).\u2019 \u201d 2 id., at\n27. James Madison believed the proposal \u201cessential to the\nefficacy [and] security of the [federal] Gov[ernmen]t.\u201d\nIbid. But others at the Convention, including Roger\nSherman, \u201cthought it unnecessary, as the Courts of the\nStates would not consider as valid any law contravening\nthe Authority of the Union, and which the legislature\nwould wish to be negatived.\u201d Ibid. In the end, Madison\u2019s\nproposal was defeated. Id., at 28. But as a substitute for\nthat rejected proposal, Luther Martin resurrected the\nSupremacy Clause provision from the New Jersey Plan\nand it was unanimously approved. See id., at 28\u201329.3\n  This historical record makes clear that the Supremacy\nClause\u2019s exclusive function is to disable state laws that are\nsubstantively inconsistent with federal law\u2014not to re\u00ad\nquire state courts to hear federal claims over which the\ncourts lack jurisdiction. This was necessarily the case\nwhen the clause was first introduced as part of the New\nJersey Plan, as it included a separate provision to confront\nthe jurisdictional question. Had that plan prevailed and\nbeen ratified by the States, construing the Supremacy\nClause to address state-court jurisdiction would have\nrendered the separate jurisdictional component of the New\nJersey Plan mere surplusage. See Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 174 (1803) (\u201cIt cannot be presumed that any\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 As proposed by Luther Martin, the Clause provided as follows:\n\n\u201c \u2018[T]hat the Legislative acts of the [United States] made by virtue [and]\nin pursuance of the articles of Union, and all treaties made [and]\nratified under the authority of the [United States] shall be the supreme\nlaw of the respective States, as far as those acts or treaties shall relate\nto the said States, or their Citizens and inhabitants\u2014[and] that the\nJudiciaries of the several States shall be bound thereby in their deci\u00ad\nsions, any thing in the respective laws of the individual States to the\ncontrary notwithstanding.\u2019 \u201d 2 Farrand 28\u201329.\n12                       HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nclause in the constitution is intended to be without ef\u00ad\nfect\u201d); see also Kelo v. New London, 545 U. S. 469, 507\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  The Supremacy Clause\u2019s exclusive focus on substantive\nstate law is also evident from the context in which it was\nrevived. First, the Clause was not adopted until after the\nNew Jersey Plan\u2019s rejection, as part of the entirely sepa\u00ad\nrate debate over Madison\u2019s proposal to grant Congress the\npower to \u201cnegative\u201d the laws of the States. By then, the\nFramers had already adopted Article III, thereby ending\nthe fight over state-court jurisdiction. The question before\nthe Convention thus was not which courts (state or fed\u00ad\neral) were best suited to adjudicate federal claims, but\nwhich branch of government (Congress or the courts)\nwould be most effective in vindicating the substantive\nsuperiority of federal law. The Supremacy Clause was\ndirectly responsive to that question.\n  Second, the timing of the Clause\u2019s adoption suggests\nthat the Framers viewed it as achieving the same end as\nMadison\u2019s congressional \u201cnegative\u201d proposal. Although\nMadison believed that Congress could most effectively\ncountermand inconsistent state laws,4 the Framers de\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Madison did not believe that federal courts were up to the task. See\n\nLetter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 24, 1787),\nreprinted in 3 id., at 131, 134 (\u201cIt may be said that the Judicial author\u00ad\nity, under our new system will keep the States within their proper\nlimits, and supply the place of a negative on their laws. The answer is,\nthat it is more convenient to prevent the passage of a law than to\ndeclare it void after it is passed; that this will be particularly the case,\nwhere the law aggrieves individuals, who may be unable to support an\nappeal [against] a State to the supreme Judiciary; that a State which\nwould violate the Legislative rights of the Union, would not be very\nready to obey a Judicial decree in support of them, and that a recur\u00ad\nrence to force, which, in the event of disobedience would be necessary,\nis an evil which the new Constitution meant to exclude as far as possi\u00ad\nble\u201d). He had even less faith in state courts. See 2 id., at 27\u201328 (\u201cCon\u00ad\nfidence can (not) be put in the State Tribunals as guardians of the\nNational authority and interests\u201d). In light of Madison\u2019s mistrust of\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

There is no evidence that the Framers envi\u00ad\nsioned the Supremacy Clause as having a substantively\nbroader sweep than the proposal it replaced. And, there\ncan be no question that Madison\u2019s congressional \u201cnegative\u201d\nproposal was entirely unconcerned with the dispute over\nwhether state courts should be required to exercise juris\u00ad\ndiction over federal claims. Indeed, Madison\u2019s proposal\ndid not require the States to become enmeshed in any\nfederal business at all; it merely provided that state laws\ncould be directly nullified if Congress found them to be\ninconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates. The role of the Supremacy Clause is no different.\nIt does not require state courts to entertain federal causes\nof action. Rather, it only requires that in reaching the\nmerits of such claims, state courts must decide the legal\nquestion in favor of the \u201claw of the Land.\u201d Art. VI, cl. 2.\n   For this reason, Representative Fisher Ames explained\nduring the debate over the First Judiciary Act that \u201c[t]he\nlaw of the United States is a rule to [state-court judges],\nbut no authority for them. It controlled their decisions,\nbut could not enlarge their powers.\u201d 1 Annals of Congress\n808 (1789) (reprint 2003). And because the Constitution\nrequires from state judges only an oath of \u201cAllegiance and\nnot an Oath of Office,\u201d the federal government \u201c[c]annot\ncompel them to act\u2014or to become our Officers.\u201d Notes of\nWilliam Patterson from Speech on Judiciary Act (June 23,\n1789), in 9 Documentary History of the First Federal\nCongress 1789\u20131791, p. 477 (K.

The Full Faith and Credit Clause\nand the Privileges and Immunities Clause include a textual prohibition\non discrimination that the Supremacy Clause lacks. See Art. IV, \u00a71\n(\u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,\nRecords, and judicial Proceedings of every other State\u201d); Art. IV, \u00a72\n(\u201cThe Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and\nImmunities of Citizens in the several States\u201d). The Framers\u2019 decision\nto address state-to-state discrimination in these two clauses without\ntaking similar steps with respect to federal-state relations governed by\nthe Supremacy Clause aligns with reasons given for abandoning the\nArticles of Confederation, see The Federalist No. 42, p. 292 (E. Bourne\ned. 1947) (J. Madison) (describing the Full Faith and Credit Clause as\n\u201can evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this\nsubject in the articles of Confederation\u201d), and the principle of dual\nsovereignty that the Constitution preserves, see Texas v. White, 7 Wall.\n700, 725 (1869). Accordingly, contrary to the majority\u2019s supposition,\nthere are in fact strong \u201creason[s] to treat the Supremacy Clause\ndifferently,\u201d ante, at 11, n. 7, from the Full Faith and Credit and\nPrivileges and Immunities Clauses.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

If the state court does not\nreach the merits of the dispute for lack of statutory or\nconstitutional jurisdiction, the preeminence of federal law\nremains undiminished.\n   Accordingly, the superiority of federal law as a substan\u00ad\ntive matter does not trigger an obligation on States to\nkeep their courts jurisdictionally neutral with respect to\nfederal and state-law claims. \u201cThe federal law in any field\nwithin which Congress is empowered to legislate is the\nsupreme law of the land in the sense that it may supplant\nstate legislation in that field, but not in the sense that it\nmay supplant the existing rules of litigation in state\ncourts. Congress has full power to provide its own courts\nfor litigating federal rights. The state courts belong to the\nStates.\u201d Brown v. Gerdes, 321 U. S. 178, 193 (1944)\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring).\n                             2\n   The Court was originally faithful to this conception of\nfederal supremacy. In Claflin, the Court concluded that\nbecause the federal statute under consideration did not\ndeprive the state court of jurisdiction, the state court was\ncompetent to resolve the claim. See 93 U. S., at 136\u2013137\n(\u201c[R]ights, whether legal or equitable, acquired under the\nlaws of the United States, may be prosecuted in the\n16                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States courts, or in the State courts, competent to\ndecide rights of the like character and class; subject, how\u00ad\never, to this qualification, that where a right arises under\na law of the United States, Congress may, if it see[s] fit,\ngive to the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction\u201d). But the\nCourt was careful to also explain that the Constitution did\nnot impose an obligation on the States to accept jurisdic\u00ad\ntion over such claims. See id., at 137 (explaining that\nthere \u201cis no reason why the State courts should not be\nopen for the prosecution of rights growing out of the laws\nof the United States, to which their jurisdiction is compe\u00ad\ntent, and not denied\u201d). The Constitution instead left the\nStates with the choice\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to enter\u00ad\ntain federal actions. See id., at 139 (\u201c[W]here no direction\nis given [from Congress] on the subject, it was assumed, in\nour early judicial history, that the State courts retained\ntheir usual jurisdiction concurrently with the Federal\nCourts invested with jurisdiction in like cases\u201d).\n   Then in Second Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1\n(1912), the Court applied the rule set forth in Claflin and\ncorrectly rejected a Connecticut court\u2019s refusal to enforce\nthe 1908 Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45\nU. S. C. \u00a751 et seq. FELA neither provided for exclusive\nfederal jurisdiction nor attempted to require state courts\nto entertain claims brought under it. See 223 U. S., at 54\u2013\n55. Therefore, the statute was enforceable \u201cas of right, in\nthe courts of the States when their jurisdiction, as pre\nscribed by local laws, is adequate to the occasion.\u201d Id., at\n55 (emphasis added). Connecticut had not deprived its\ncourts of subject-matter jurisdiction over FELA claims;\nthus, the state court\u2019s refusal to hear the claim was \u201cnot\nbecause the ordinary jurisdiction of the Superior Courts,\nas defined by the constitution and laws of the State, was\ndeemed inadequate or not adapted to the adjudication of\nsuch a case.\u201d Ibid. Rather, the state court took the posi\u00ad\ntion that \u201cit would be inconvenient and confusing for the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            17\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsame court, in dealing with cases of the same general\nclass, to apply in some the standards of right established\nby the congressional act and in others the different stan\u00ad\ndards recognized by the laws of the State.\u201d Id., at 55\u201356.\n   The Court\u2019s reversal of such a decision is compatible\nwith the original understanding of Article III and the\nSupremacy Clause. Because there was no question that\nthe state court had subject-matter jurisdiction under state\nlaw to adjudicate the federal claim, id., at 57, the Court\ncorrectly observed that the state court\u2019s refusal to decide\nthe case amounted to a policy dispute with federal law:\n\u201cWhen Congress, in the exertion of the power confided to it\nby the Constitution, adopted that [federal] act, it spoke for\nall the people and all the States, and thereby established a\npolicy for all. That policy is as much the policy of Con\u00ad\nnecticut as if the act had emanated from its own legisla\u00ad\nture, and should be respected accordingly in the courts of\nthe State.\u201d Ibid. It was for this specific reason, then, that\nthe Court rejected Connecticut\u2019s refusal to adjudicate the\nfederal claim. As the Court correctly noted, the \u201cexistence\nof the jurisdiction creates an implication of duty to exer\u00ad\ncise it, and that its exercise may be onerous does not\nmilitate against that implication.\u201d Id., at 58.\n   But nothing in Second Employers\u2019 suggested that the\nSupremacy Clause could pre-empt a state law that de\u00ad\nprived the local court of subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe federal claim. Instead, the Second Employers\u2019 Court\ntook exactly the opposite position on this question: \u201c[W]e\ndeem it well to observe that there is not here involved any\nattempt by Congress to enlarge or regulate the jurisdiction\nof state courts . . . but only a question of the duty of such a\ncourt, when its ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by local\nlaws is appropriate to the occasion.\u201d Id., at 56\u201357.\n   The Court again confronted this issue in Douglas v. New\nYork, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279 U. S. 377 (1929). There, the\nCourt considered whether a New York court was required\n18                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nto hear a claim brought under FELA. Unlike the Con\u00ad\nnecticut court in Second Employers\u2019, however, the New\nYork court did not have jurisdiction under state law to\nentertain the federal cause of action. 279 U. S., at 386\u2013\n387. As a result, this Court upheld the state-court ruling\nthat dismissed the claim. The Court explained that FELA\ndid \u201cnot purport to require State Courts to entertain suits\narising under it, but only to empower them to do so, so far\nas the authority of the United States is concerned. It may\nvery well be that if the Supreme Court of New York [was]\ngiven no discretion, being otherwise competent, it would\nbe subject to a duty. But there is nothing in the Act of\nCongress that purports to force a duty upon such Courts\nas against an otherwise valid excuse.\u201d Id., at 387\u2013388. In\nother words, because the New York court lacked subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction under state law, it was not \u201cotherwise\ncompetent\u201d to adjudicate the federal claim.\n  In sum, Claflin, Second Employers\u2019, and Douglas to\u00ad\ngether establish that a state court\u2019s inability to entertain a\nfederal claim because of a lack of state-law jurisdiction is\nan \u201cotherwise valid excuse\u201d that in no way denies the\nsuperiority of federal substantive law. It simply disables\nthe state court from adjudicating a claim brought under\nthat federal law.\n                               3\n  It was not until five years after Douglas that the Court\nused the Supremacy Clause to strike down a state juris\u00ad\ndictional statute for its failure to permit state-court adju\u00ad\ndication of federal claims. See McKnett, 292 U. S. 230.\nThe Court started by correctly noting that it \u201cwas settled\u201d\nin Second Employers\u2019 \u201cthat a state court whose ordinary\njurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is appropriate to\nthe occasion, may not refuse to entertain suits under\n[FELA].\u201d 292 U. S., at 233. Yet, even though the Alabama\ncourt lacked such jurisdiction over the relevant federal\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nclaim pursuant to a state statute, the McKnett Court held\nthat the state court had improperly dismissed the federal\nclaim. Id., at 231\u2013234.\n   According to the Court, \u201c[w]hile Congress has not at\u00ad\ntempted to compel states to provide courts for the en\u00ad\nforcement of [FELA], the Federal Constitution prohibits\nstate courts of general jurisdiction from refusing to do so\nsolely because the suit is brought under a federal law.\nThe denial of jurisdiction by the Alabama court is based\nsolely upon the source of law sought to be enforced. The\nplaintiff is cast out because he is suing to enforce a federal\nact. A state may not discriminate against rights arising\nunder federal laws.\u201d Id., at 233\u2013234.\n   For all the reasons identified above, McKnett cannot be\nreconciled with the decisions of this Court that preceded\nit. Unlike the Connecticut court in Second Employers\u2019, the\nAlabama Supreme Court did not indulge its own bias\nagainst adjudication of federal claims in state court by\nrefusing to hear a federal claim over which it had subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction. Rather, like the New York court\ndecision affirmed in Douglas, the Alabama court\u2019s dis\u00ad\nmissal merely respected a jurisdictional barrier to adjudi\u00ad\ncation of the federal claim imposed by state law. The fact\nthat Alabama courts were competent to hear similar state\u00ad\nlaw claims should have been immaterial. Alabama had\nexercised its sovereign right to establish the subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction of its courts. Under Claflin and its\nprogeny, that legislative judgment should have been up\u00ad\nheld.\n   Despite McKnett\u2019s infidelity to the Constitution and\nmore than a century of Supreme Court jurisprudence, the\nCourt\u2019s later decisions have repeated McKnett\u2019s declara\u00ad\ntion that state jurisdictional statutes must be policed for\nantifederal discrimination. See, e.g., Testa v. Katt, 330\nU. S. 386, 394 (1947) (\u201cIt is conceded that this same type\nof claim arising under Rhode Island law would be enforced\n20                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nby that State\u2019s courts. . . . Under these circumstances the\nState courts are not free to refuse enforcement of petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 claim\u201d); Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 375 (1990)\n(\u201c[W]hether the question is framed in pre-emption terms,\nas petitioner would have it, or in the obligation to assume\njurisdiction over a \u2018federal\u2019 cause of action, . . . the Florida\ncourt\u2019s refusal to entertain one discrete category of \u00a71983\nclaims, when the court entertains similar state-law actions\nagainst state defendants, violates the Supremacy Clause\u201d).\nThe outcome in these cases, however, can be reconciled\nwith first principles notwithstanding the Court\u2019s stated\nreliance on McKnett\u2019s flawed interpretation of the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause.6\n   In Testa, the Court struck down the Rhode Island Su\u00ad\npreme Court\u2019s refusal to entertain a claim under the fed\u00ad\neral Emergency Price Control Act. There was no dispute\nthat \u201cthe Rhode Island courts [had] jurisdiction adequate\nand appropriate under established local law to adjudicate\nthis action.\u201d 330 U. S., at 394, and n. 13. The Rhode\nIsland court nevertheless declined to exercise that juris\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Other decisions also have articulated this antidiscrimination princi\u00ad\nple. See, e.g., Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U. S. 911 (1997); Missouri ex rel.\nSouthern R. Co. v. Mayfield, 340 U. S. 1 (1950); Herb v. Pitcairn, 324\nU. S. 117 (1945); Miles v. Illinois Central R. Co., 315 U. S. 698 (1942).\nThe outcomes in these cases nonetheless preserved state-court jurisdic\u00ad\ntional autonomy. In Johnson and Herb, the Court sustained the state\u00ad\ncourt dismissals of the federal claims as nondiscriminatory. See\nJohnson, supra, at 918\u2013920; Herb, supra, at 123. In Mayfield, the\nCourt never decided whether the state court had jurisdiction over the\nrelevant federal claim; rather, it remanded the case to the Missouri\nSupreme Court based on the state court\u2019s possibly erroneous interpre\u00ad\ntation of federal law at issue in that case. See 340 U. S., at 4\u20135.\nFinally, in Miles, the Court struck down a Tennessee decision that\nenjoined a citizen of that State from pursuing a FELA action in Mis\u00ad\nsouri state court \u201con grounds of inequity.\u201d 315 U. S., at 702. The Court\ncorrectly held that, so long as jurisdiction existed under Missouri law,\nthe Tennessee court could not rely on its own notions of \u201cinequity\u201d to\nthwart the vindication of a federal right in state court. Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   21\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndiction under its decision in Robinson v. Norato, 71 R. I.\n256, 258, 43 A. 2d 467, 468 (1945), which had relied on a\n\u201cuniversally acknowledged\u201d doctrine \u201cof private interna\u00ad\ntional law\u201d as a basis for refusing to adjudicate federal\n\u201cpenal\u201d claims. Because the Rhode Island Supreme Court\nhad invoked this common-law doctrine despite the exis\u00ad\ntence of state-law statutory jurisdiction over the federal\nclaims, this Court correctly ruled that the state court\u2019s\n\u201cpolicy against enforcement . . . of statutes of other states\nand the United States which it deems penal, [could not] be\naccepted as a \u2018valid excuse.\u2019 \u201d 330 U. S., at 392\u2013393.\n   Testa thus represents a routine application of the rule of\nlaw set forth in Second Employers\u2019: As long as jurisdiction\nover a federal claim exists as a matter of state law, state\u00ad\ncourt judges cannot sua sponte refuse to enforce federal\nlaw because they disagree with Congress\u2019 decision to allow\nfor adjudication of certain federal claims in state court.\nSee 330 U. S., at 393 (\u201c[A] state court cannot \u2018refuse to\nenforce the right arising from the law of the United States\nbecause of conceptions of impolicy or want of wisdom on\nthe part of Congress in having called into play its lawful\npowers\u2019 \u201d (quoting Minneapolis & St. Louis R.

S. 211,\nwhich held that the Seventh Amendment does not require a unanimous\njury verdict when federal civil claims are adjudicated in state court,\nprovides no support for the antidiscrimination principle. As quoted\nabove, the Court (in dicta) accurately summarized the holding of\nSecond Employers\u2019. See 241 U. S., at 222. The Court also reiterated\nthat before a state court owes a duty to enforce federal law, it must\nhave subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim under state law. See\nid., at 221 (\u201c[L]awful rights of the citizen, whether arising from a\nlegitimate exercise of state or national power . . . are concurrently\nsubject to be enforced in the courts of the State or nation when such\nrights come within the general scope of the jurisdiction conferred upon\nsuch courts by the authority, State or nation, creating them\u201d); id., at\n22                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   In Howlett, the Court likewise correctly struck down a\nFlorida Supreme Court decision affirming the dismissal of\na \u00a71983 suit on state-law sovereign immunity grounds.\nSee 496 U. S., at 361, 375\u2013381. The Florida court had\ninterpreted the State\u2019s statutory \u201cwaiver of sovereign\nimmunity\u201d not to extend to federal claims brought in state\ncourt. Id., at 361 (citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7768.28 (1989)). Ac\u00ad\ncording to the state court, absent a statutory waiver,\nFlorida\u2019s pre-existing common-law sovereign immunity\nrule provided a \u201cblanket immunity on [state] governmen\u00ad\ntal entities from federal civil rights actions under \u00a71983\u201d\nbrought in Florida courts. 496 U. S., at 364. Based on\nthis rule, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the dis\u00ad\nmissal with prejudice of the \u00a71983 suit against the state\nofficials. See id., at 359; see also Howlett v. Rose, 537\nSo. 2d 706, 708 (Fla. App. 1989) (concluding that Florida\u2019s\n\u201ccommon law immunity\u201d rule barred \u201cthe use of its courts\nfor suits against the state in those state courts\u201d).\n   No antidiscrimination rule was required to strike down\nthe Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Even though sev\u00ad\neral Florida courts had concluded that the defense of\nsovereign immunity was jurisdictional, see 496 U. S., at\n361, n. 5, \u201c[t]he force of the Supremacy Clause is not so\nweak that it can be evaded by mere mention of the word\n\u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 \u201d id., at 382\u2013383. That is, state courts cannot\nevade their obligation to enforce federal law by simply\ncharacterizing a statute or common-law rule as \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional\u201d; the state law must in fact operate in a jurisdic\u00ad\ntional manner. No matter where the line between subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction and the merits is drawn, see supra, at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n222 (explaining that state courts are \u201ccharged with the duty to safe\u00ad\nguard and enforce the right of every citizen without reference to the\nparticular exercise of governmental power from which the right may\nhave arisen, if only the authority to enforce such right comes generally\nwithin the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by the government creat\u00ad\ning them\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Cf. Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531\nU. S. 497, 505 (2001) (\u201c \u2018With prejudice\u2019 is an acceptable\nform of shorthand for \u2018an adjudication upon the merits\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting 9 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a72373, p. 396, n. 4 (1981))). Sec\u00ad\nond, Florida\u2019s sovereign immunity rule violated the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause by operating as a state-law defense to a\nfederal law. See Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277,\n284, n. 8 (1980) (\u201c \u2018[P]ermitt[ing] a state immunity defense\nto have controlling effect\u2019 \u201d over a federal claim violates the\nSupremacy Clause). Resolving a federal claim with pre\u00ad\nclusive effect based on a state-law defense is far different\nfrom simply closing the door of the state courthouse to\nthat federal claim. The first changes federal law by deny\u00ad\ning relief on the merits; the second merely dictates the\nforum in which the federal claim will be heard.\n  In the end, of course, \u201cthe ultimate touchstone of consti\u00ad\ntutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have\nsaid about it.\u201d Graves v. New York ex rel. O\u2019Keefe, 306\nU. S. 466, 491\u2013492 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\nAnd contrary to McKnett, the Constitution does not re\u00ad\nquire state courts to give equal billing to state and federal\nclaims. To read the Supremacy Clause to include an anti\u00ad\ndiscrimination principle undermines the compromise that\nshaped Article III and contradicts the original understand\u00ad\ning of Constitution. There is no justification for preserv\u00ad\ning such a principle. But even if the Court chooses to\nadhere to the antidiscrimination rule as part of the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause inquiry, the rule\u2019s infidelity to the text,\nstructure, and history of the Constitution counsels against\nextending the principle any further than our precedent\nrequires. Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 584\u2013\n585 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring); see infra, at 27\u201333.\n24                      HAYWOOD v.

Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 62\u201363 (2002); United\nStates v. Locke, 529 U.

NYCLA \u00a724 does not\nfall prey to either category of pre-emption.8\n  First, federal law does not expressly require New York\ncourts to accept jurisdiction over \u00a71983 suits. Under\n\u00a71983, any state official who denies \u201cany citizen of the\nUnited States or other person within the jurisdiction\nthereof . . . any rights, privileges, or immunities secured\nby the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party\ninjured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper\nproceeding for redress.\u201d The statute addresses who may\nsue and be sued for violations of federal law.

Its purpose, as we have repeatedly said, \u2018was to\ninterpose the federal courts between the States and the\npeople, as guardians of the people\u2019s federal rights\u2019 \u201d (quot\u00ad\ning Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 503\n(1982))). Like FELA, therefore, \u00a71983 does not \u201cenlarge or\nregulate the jurisdiction of state courts.\u201d Second Employ\ners\u2019, 223 U. S., at 56.9\n   Second, NYCLA \u00a724 does not conflict with \u00a71983. See\nWyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that the\nCourt has alternatively described the standard for conflict\npre-emption as \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d and \u201cdirect con\u00ad\nflict\u201d (citations omitted)). As explained above, Congress\ndid not grant \u00a71983 plaintiffs a \u201cright\u201d to bring their\nclaims in state court or \u201cguarantee\u201d that the state forum\nwould remain open to their suits. See id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). Moreover, Congress has created inferior federal\ncourts that have the power to adjudicate all \u00a71983 actions.\nAnd this Court has expressly determined that \u00a71983\nplaintiffs do not have to exhaust state-court remedies\nbefore proceeding in federal court. See Patsy, supra, at\n516.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The history surrounding \u00a71983\u2019s enactment also supports this con\u00ad\nclusion. See Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 158 (1988),(O\u2019Connor, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201c[T]he original version of \u00a71983 provided that the federal\ncourts would have exclusive jurisdiction of actions arising under it.\nThis fact is conclusive proof that the Congress which enacted \u00a71983\nover 100 years ago, could not possibly have meant thereby to alter the\noperation of state courts in any way . . . . Abandoning the rule of\nexclusive federal jurisdiction over \u00a71983 actions, and thus restoring the\ntradition of concurrent jurisdiction . . . did not leave behind a pre\u00ad\nemptive grin without a statutory cat\u201d (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted)).\n26                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Therefore, even if every state court closed its doors to\n\u00a71983 plaintiffs, the plaintiffs could proceed with their\nclaims in the federal forum. See, e.g., Felder, supra, at 160\n(O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cEvery plaintiff has the option\nof proceeding in federal court, and the Wisconsin statute\nhas not the slightest effect on that right\u201d). And because\nthe dismissal of \u00a71983 claims from state court pursuant to\nNYCLA \u00a724 is for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, see\nsupra, at 8\u20139, it has no preclusive effect on claims refiled\nin federal court, see Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 94,\n105 (1980) (requiring \u201ca final judgment on the merits\u201d\nbefore a \u00a71983 would be barred in federal court under\nthe doctrine of claim preclusion), and thus does not alter\nthe substance of the federal claim.           Any contention\nthat NYCLA \u00a724 conflicts with \u00a71983 therefore would be\nmisplaced.\n   The Court nevertheless has relied on an expansive\nbrand of \u201cconflict\u201d pre-emption to strike down state-court\nprocedural rules that are perceived to \u201cburde[n] the exer\u00ad\ncise of the federal right\u201d in state court. Felder, 487 U. S.,\nat 141. In such cases, the Court has asked if the state-law\nrule, when applied \u201cto \u00a71983 actions brought in state\ncourts [is] consistent with the goals of the federal civil\nrights laws, or does the enforcement of such a requirement\ninstead \u2018stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and\nexecution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u2019?\u201d\nSee id., at 138 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,\n67 (1941)). There has been no suggestion in this case,\nhowever, that NYCLA \u00a724 is a procedural rule that must\nbe satisfied in order to bring the \u00a71983 action in state\ncourt. See supra, at 8\u20139; infra, at 27; see also ante, at 13,\nn. 9. As explained above, petitioner\u2019s claim was not proce\u00ad\ndurally deficient; the state court simply lacked the power\nto adjudicate the claim. See supra, at 8\u20139. Thus, the\nFelder line of cases is inapplicable to this case.\n   But even if there were such a claim made in this case,\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

VI, cl. 2\u2014not by extratextual considerations of\nthe purposes underlying congressional inaction,\u201d such as a\ndesire to ensure that federal law is not burdened by state\u00ad\nlaw procedural obligations. Wyeth, 555 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 23) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). A sweep\u00ad\ning approach to pre-emption based on perceived congres\u00ad\nsional purposes \u201cleads to the illegitimate\u2014and thus, un\u00ad\nconstitutional\u2014invalidation of state laws.\u201d Id., at __ (slip\nop., at 24). I cannot agree with the approach employed in\nFelder \u201cthat pre-empts state laws merely because they\n\u2018stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution\nof the full purposes and objectives\u2019 of federal law . . . as\nperceived by this Court.\u201d 555 U.

The majority con\u00ad\ncedes not only that NYCLA \u00a724 is jurisdictional, but that\nthe statute is neutral with respect to federal and state\nclaims. Nevertheless, it concludes that the statute vio\u00ad\nlates the Supremacy Clause because it finds that \u201cequality\nof treatment does not ensure that a state law will be\ndeemed a neutral rule of judicial administration and\ntherefore a valid excuse for refusing to entertain a federal\ncause of action.\u201d Ante, at 8\u20139. This conclusion is incorrect\nin light of Court precedent for several reasons.\n                         A\n  The majority mischaracterizes this Court\u2019s precedent\n28                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhen it asserts that jurisdictional neutrality is \u201cthe be\u00ad\nginning, not the end, of the Supremacy Clause analysis.\u201d\nAnte, at 9\u201310. As explained above, see supra, at 10\u201323,\n\u201csubject to only one limitation, each State of the Union\nmay establish its own judicature, distribute judicial power\namong the courts of its choice, [and] define the conditions\nfor the exercise of their jurisdiction and the modes of their\nproceeding, to the same extent as Congress is empowered\nto establish a system of inferior federal courts within the\nlimits of federal judicial power.\u201d Brown, 321 U. S., at 188\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring). That \u201cone limitation\u201d is the\nneutrality principle that the Court has found in the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause. See id., at 189 (\u201cThe only limitation\nupon the freedom of a State to define the jurisdiction of its\nown courts is that . . . [it] must treat litigants under the\nFederal act as other litigants are treated\u201d (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted)); Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 123\n(1945) (\u201cThe freedom of the state courts so to decide is, of\ncourse, subject to the qualification that the cause of action\nmust not be discriminated against because it is a federal\none\u201d). Here, it is conceded that New York has deprived its\ncourts of subject-matter jurisdiction over a particular class\nof claims on terms that treat federal and state actions\nequally. See ante, at 1\u20132, 8\u201310. That is all this Court\u2019s\nprecedent requires. See supra, at 9, 18\u201319.\n   The majority\u2019s assertion that jurisdictional neutrality is\nnot the touchstone because \u201c[a] jurisdictional rule cannot\nbe used as a device to undermine federal law, no matter\nhow even-handed it may appear,\u201d ante, at 9, reflects a\nmisunderstanding of the law. A jurisdictional statute\nsimply deprives the relevant court of the power to decide\nthe case altogether. See 10A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72713, p. 239 (3d\ned. 1998) (\u201cIf the court has no jurisdiction, it has no power\nto enter a judgment on the merits and must dismiss the\naction\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a711, p. 108\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     29\n\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(1980) (defining subject-matter jurisdiction as a court\u2019s\n\u201cauthority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in\nthe action\u201d). Such a statute necessarily operates without\nprejudice to the adjudication of the matter in a competent\nforum. See supra, at 14\u201315. Jurisdictional statutes there\u00ad\nfore by definition are incapable of undermining federal\nlaw. NYCLA \u00a724 no more undermines \u00a71983 than the\namount-in-controversy requirement for federal diversity\njurisdiction undermines state law. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332.\nThe relevant law (state or federal) remains fully operative\nin both circumstances. The sole consequence of the juris\u00ad\ndictional barrier is that the law cannot be enforced in one\nparticular judicial forum.10\n  As a result, the majority\u2019s focus on New York\u2019s reasons\nfor enacting this jurisdictional statute is entirely mis\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 If by asserting that state law is not permitted to \u201cundermine fed\u00ad\neral law,\u201d ante, at 9, the majority instead is arguing that NYCLA \u00a724 is\na procedural rule that too heavily \u201cburdens the exercise of the federal\nright\u201d in state court, see Felder, 487 U. S., at 141, its argument is\nequally misplaced. First, the majority concedes that NYCLA \u00a724 is not\na state procedural rule. See ante, at 12, n. 8. Second, applying the\nreasoning of Felder to a jurisdictional statute like NYCLA \u00a724 would\noverrule all of the Court\u2019s decisions upholding state laws that decline\njurisdiction over federal claims, and would virtually ensure that in\nfuture cases, no state jurisdictional rule will be upheld as constitu\u00ad\ntional. By simply rendering a federal claim noncognizable in state\ncourt, a statute depriving a state court of subject-matter jurisdiction\n(even under the terms and conditions permitted by this Court\u2019s prece\u00ad\ndent) will always violate Felder\u2019s command that a state rule must not\nundermine the \u201cremedial objectives\u201d of a federal claim, see 487 U. S., at\n138. The jurisdictional statute also will unavoidably implicate Felder\u2019s\nconcern that a state rule should not inevitably produce a different\noutcome depending on whether a claim is asserted in state or federal\ncourt, see ibid. A state jurisdictional statute necessarily will result in a\ndifferent outcome in state court, where it will cause dismissal of the\nfederal claim, than in federal court, where that claim will be heard. It\nis for this reason that the Court has been careful to keep its examina\u00ad\ntion of state jurisdictional statutes and state procedural rules in differ\u00ad\nent categories.\n30                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nplaced. See ante, at 7\u20138. The States \u201cremain independent\nand autonomous within their proper sphere of authority.\u201d\nPrintz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898, 928 (1997). New\nYork has the organic authority, therefore, to tailor the\njurisdiction of state courts to meet its policy goals. See\nFay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 466\u2013467 (1963) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cThe right of the State to regulate its own\nprocedures governing the conduct of litigants in its courts,\nand its interest in supervision of those procedures, stand\non the same constitutional plane as its right and interest\nin framing \u2018substantive\u2019 laws governing other aspects of\nthe conduct of those within its borders\u201d).\n   It may be true that it was \u201cCongress\u2019 judgment that all\npersons who violate federal rights while acting under color\nof state law shall be held liable for damages.\u201d Ante, at 7\u2013\n8. But Congress has not enforced that judgment by statu\u00ad\ntorily requiring the States to open their courts to all \u00a71983\nclaims. See n. 8, supra. And this Court has \u201cnever held\nthat state courts must entertain \u00a71983 suits.\u201d National\nPrivate Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, 515\nU. S. 582, 587, n. 4 (1995). Our decisions have held only\nthat the States cannot use jurisdictional statutes to dis\u00ad\ncriminate against federal claims. Because NYCLA \u00a724\ndoes not violate this command, any policy-driven reasons\nfor depriving jurisdiction over a \u201cfederal claim in addition\nto an identical state claim,\u201d ante, at 8, are irrelevant for\npurposes of the Supremacy Clause.\n   This Court\u2019s decision in Howlett is not to the contrary.\nDespite the majority\u2019s assertion, Howlett does not stand\nfor the proposition \u201cthat a State cannot employ a jurisdic\u00ad\ntional rule \u2018to dissociate itself from federal law because of\ndisagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the\nsuperior authority of its source.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6 (quoting\nHowlett, 496 U. S., at 371). As an initial matter, the ma\u00ad\njority lifts the above quotation\u2014which was merely part of\na passage explaining that a \u201cState may not discriminate\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           31\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nagainst federal causes of action,\u201d id., at 372\u2014entirely out\nof context. Howlett\u2019s reiteration of McKnett\u2019s neutrality\ncommand, which is all the selected quotation reflects, see\n496 U. S., at 372\u2013373, offers no refuge to the majority in\nlight of its concession that NYCLA \u00a724 affords \u201cequal\ntreatment\u201d to \u201cfederal and state claims.\u201d Ante, at 8.\n   Howlett instead stands for the unremarkable proposi\u00ad\ntion that States may not add immunity defenses to \u00a71983.\nSee ante, at 7, n. 5 (explaining that Howlett held that \u201ca\nFlorida school board could [not] assert a state-law immu\u00ad\nnity defense in a \u00a71983 action brought in state court\u201d\nbecause \u201cthe \u2018elements of, and the defenses to, a federal\ncause of action are defined by federal law\u2019 \u201d (quoting 496\nU. S., at 375)). A state law is not jurisdictional just be\u00ad\ncause the legislature has \u201cdenominated\u201d it as such. Id., at\n381. As the majority observes, the State\u2019s \u201cinvocation of\n\u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d cannot \u201ctrump\u201d the \u201cSupremacy Clause\ninquiry,\u201d ante, at 11\u201312. The majority, therefore, is cor\u00ad\nrect that a state court\u2019s decision \u201cto nullify a federal right\nor cause of action [that it] believe[s] is inconsistent with\n[its] local policies\u201d cannot evade the Supremacy Clause by\nhiding behind a jurisdictional label, ante, at 6, because\n\u201cthe Supremacy Clause cannot be evaded by formalism,\u201d\nante, at 13. Rather, a state statute must in fact operate\njurisdictionally: It must deprive the court of the power to\nhear the claim and it must not preclude relitigation of the\naction in a proper forum. See supra, at 28\u201329. Howlett\nproved the point by striking down a state-law immunity\nrule that bore the jurisdictional label but operated as a\ndefense on the merits and provided for the dismissal of the\nstate court action with prejudice. See 496 U. S., at 359;\nsupra, at 22\u201323.\n   But the majority\u2019s axiomatic refrain about jurisdictional\nlabels is entirely unresponsive to the issue before the\nCourt\u2014i.e., whether NYCLA \u00a724 operates jurisdictionally.\nUnlike the Florida immunity rule in Howlett, NYCLA \u00a724\n32                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis not a defense to a federal claim and the dismissal it\nauthorizes is without prejudice. See 9 N. Y. 3d 481, 490,\n881 N. E. 2d 180, 186 (2007) (explaining that \u201cthe Legisla\u00ad\nture did nothing more than exercise its prerogative to\nestablish the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts\u201d\nand that \u201clitigants like plaintiff can use the federal courts\nto pursue section 1983 claims\u201d against correction officers).\nFor this reason, NYCLA \u00a724 is not merely \u201cdenominated\u201d\nas jurisdictional\u2014it actually is jurisdictional. The New\nYork courts, therefore, have not declared a \u201ccategory\u201d of\n\u00a71983 claims to be \u201c \u2018frivolous\u2019 \u201d or to have \u201c \u2018no merit\u2019 \u201d in\norder to \u201c \u2018relieve congestion\u2019 \u201d in the state-court system.\nSee ante, at 7\u20138 (quoting Howlett, supra, at 380). These\ncourts have simply recognized that they lack the power to\nadjudicate this category of claims regardless of their\nmerit.\n   The majority\u2019s failure to grapple with the clear differ\u00ad\nences between the immunity rule at issue in Howlett and\nNYCLA \u00a724 proves that its decision is untethered from\nprecedent. And more broadly, the majority\u2019s failure to\naccount for the important role of claim preclusion in\nevaluating whether a statute is jurisdictional undermines\nthe important line drawn by this Court\u2019s decisions be\u00ad\ntween subject-matter jurisdiction and the merits. See\nMarrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,\n470 U. S. 373, 382 (1985) (\u201cWith respect to matters that\nwere not decided in the state proceedings . . . claim preclu\u00ad\nsion generally does not apply where \u2018the plaintiff was\nunable to . . . seek a remedy because of the limitations on\nthe subject matter jurisdiction of the courts\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a726(1)(c)(1982))); see\nalso Arbaugh, 546 U.

But this curious rejoinder resurrects an\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

The majority needs to choose.\nEither it should definitively commit to making the impos\u00ad\nsible case that a statute denying state courts the power to\nentertain a claim without prejudice to its reassertion in\nfederal court is an immunity defense in disguise, or it\nshould clearly explain why some other aspect of Howlett\ncontrols the outcome of this case. This Court has required\nCongress to speak clearly when it intends to \u201cupset the\nusual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.\u201d\nGregory, 501 U. S., at 460. It should require no less of\nitself.\n   At bottom, the majority\u2019s warning that upholding New\nYork\u2019s law \u201cwould permit a State to withhold a forum for\nthe adjudication of any federal cause of action with which\nit disagreed as long as the policy took the form of a juris\u00ad\ndictional rule\u201d is without any basis in fact. Ante, at 13,\nn. 9. This Court\u2019s jurisdictional neutrality command al\u00ad\nready guards against antifederal discrimination. A deci\u00ad\nsion upholding NYCLA \u00a724, which fully adheres to that\nrule, would not \u201ccircumvent our prior decisions.\u201d Ibid. It\nsimply would adhere to them.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The majority also suggests that allowing jurisdictional neutrality to\n\nbe the test \u201cwould create a blind spot in the Supremacy Clause\u201d be\u00ad\ncause a procedural rule that too heavily burdens a federal cause of\naction would be struck down as unconstitutional while \u201ca State could\nexpress its disagreement with (and even open hostility to) a federal\ncause of action, declare a desire to thwart its enforcement, and achieve\nthat goal by removing the disfavored category of claims from its courts\u2019\njurisdiction.\u201d Ante, at 12, n. 8. This is incorrect for at least two rea\u00ad\nsons. First, as explained above, a State may permissibly register its\nhostility to federal law only by subjecting analogous state-law claims to\nequally disfavored treatment. See supra, at 19\u201320. Hostility to federal\nlaw is thus irrelevant under this Court\u2019s precedent\u2014the Supremacy\nClause is concerned only with whether there is antifederal discrimina\u00ad\ntion. Second, the majority obscures important differences between\nprocedural rules, like the notice-of-claim rule at issue in Felder, and\nneutral jurisdictional statutes like NYCLA \u00a724. Unlike a neutral\n34                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n   The majority also incorrectly concludes that NYCLA \u00a724\nis not a neutral jurisdictional statute because it applies to\na \u201cnarrow class of defendants,\u201d ante, at 7, and because\nNew York courts \u201chear the lion\u2019s share of all other \u00a71983\nactions,\u201d ante, at 12. A statute\u2019s jurisdictional status does\nnot turn on its narrowness or on its breadth. See Ar\nbaugh, supra, at 515, n. 11. Rather, as explained above, a\nstatute\u2019s jurisdictional status turns on the grounds on\nwhich the state-law dismissal rests and the consequences\nthat follow from such rulings. No matter how narrow the\nmajority perceives NYCLA \u00a724 to be, it easily qualifies as\njurisdictional under this established standard. Accord\u00ad\ningly, it is immaterial that New York has chosen to allow\nits courts of general jurisdiction to entertain \u00a71983 actions\nagainst certain categories of defendants but not others\n(such as correction officers), or to entertain \u00a71983 actions\nagainst particular defendants for only certain types of\nrelief.\n   Building on its assumption that a statute\u2019s jurisdictional\nstatus turns on its scope, the majority further holds that\n\u201chaving made the decision to create courts of general\njurisdiction that regularly sit to entertain analogous suits,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\njurisdictional statute, which merely prevents a state court from enter\u00ad\ntaining a federal claim, failure to comply with a state procedural rule\nwill result in dismissal of a federal claim with prejudice. See Felder,\n487 U. S., at 151 (explaining that the State\u2019s \u201coutcome-determinative\nlaw must give way when a party asserts a federal right in state court\u201d).\nContrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, therefore, it is not that state\ncourts with \u201cunconstitutionally burdensome procedural rules did not go\nfar enough\u201d\u2014it is instead that they went too far by placing an insur\u00ad\nmountable procedural hurdle in the plaintiff\u2019s path that led to a judg\u00ad\nment against him on the merits. Ante, at 12, n. 8. As a result, the\nCourt\u2019s assessment of whether a state procedural rule too heavily\nburdens a federal right does not have any bearing on the Court\u2019s\ncontinued adherence to the neutrality principle as the sole determinant\nin evaluating state-law jurisdictional statutes.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           35\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nNew York is not at liberty to shut the courthouse door to\nfederal claims that it considers at odds with its local pol\u00ad\nicy.\u201d Ante, at 11. But whether two claims are \u201canalogous\u201d\nis relevant only for purposes of determining whether a\nstate jurisdictional statute discriminates against federal\nlaw. This inquiry necessarily requires an evaluation of\nthe similarities between federal and state law claims to\nassess whether state-court jurisdiction is being denied to a\nfederal claim simply because of its federal character.\n   In contrast, the majority limits its analysis to state-law\nclaims, finding discrimination based solely on the fact that\nstate law provides jurisdiction in state court for claims\nagainst state officials who serve in \u201canalogous\u201d roles to the\ncorrection officers. See ante, at 10. The majority\u2019s inquiry\nis not probative of antifederal discrimination, which is the\nconcern that first led this Court in McKnett to find a Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause limitation on state-court jurisdictional\nautonomy. Consequently, there is no support for the\nmajority\u2019s assertion that New York\u2019s decision to treat\npolice officers differently from correction officers for pur\u00ad\nposes of civil litigation somehow violates the Constitution.\nSee ante, at 10.\n   Worse still, the majority concludes that \u00a71983 claims for\ndamages against \u201cother state officials\u201d are \u201csufficiently\nanalogous to petitioner\u2019s \u00a71983 claims\u201d to trigger a Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause violation. Ante, at 10\u201311, and n. 6. Un\u00ad\nder this reasoning, if a State grants its trial courts juris\u00ad\ndiction to hear \u00a71983 claims for damages against any state\nofficial, the State\u2019s decision to deny those courts the power\nto entertain some narrower species of \u00a71983 claims\u2014even\non jurisdictionally neutral terms\u2014a fortiori violates the\nSupremacy Clause. The majority\u2019s assurance that its\nholding is applicable only to New York\u2019s \u201cunique scheme\u201d\nthus rings hollow. Ante, at 12. The majority is forcing\nStates into an all-or-nothing choice that neither the Con\u00ad\nstitution nor this Court\u2019s decisions require. See FERC v.\n36                   HAYWOOD v.

It cannot\nbe that New York has forsaken the right to withdraw a\nparticular class of claims from its courts\u2019 purview simply\nbecause it has created courts of general jurisdiction that\nwould otherwise have the power to hear suits for damages\nagainst correction officers. The Supremacy Clause does\nnot fossilize the jurisdiction of state courts in their original\nform. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, States remain free to\nalter the structure of their judicial system even if that\nmeans certain federal causes of action will no longer be\nheard in state court, so long as States do so on nondis\u00ad\ncriminatory terms. See Printz, 521 U. S., at 906, n. 1.\n(explaining that \u201cthe States obviously regulate the \u2018ordi\u00ad\nnary jurisdiction\u2019 of their courts\u201d); Johnson v. Fankell, 520\nU.

Further\u00ad\nmore, by declaring unconstitutional even those laws that\ndivest state courts of jurisdiction over federal claims on a\nnon-discriminatory basis, the majority has silently over\u00ad\nturned this Court\u2019s unbroken line of decisions upholding\nstate statutes that are materially indistinguishable from\nthe New York law under review. And it has transformed a\nsingle exception to the rule of state judicial autonomy into\na virtually ironclad obligation to entertain federal busi\u00ad\nness. I respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued December 3, 2008\u2014Decided May 26, 2009\nBelieving that damages suits filed by prisoners against state correction\n  officers were largely frivolous and vexatious, New York passed Cor\n  rection Law \u00a724, which divested state courts of general jurisdiction of\n  their jurisdiction over such suits, including those filed under 42\n  U. S. C. \u00a71983, and replaced those claims with the State\u2019s preferred\n  alternative. Thereunder, a prisoner will have his claim against a cor\n  rection officer dismissed for want of jurisdiction and will be left to\n  pursue a damages claim against the State in the Court of Claims, a\n  court of limited jurisdiction in which the prisoner will not be entitled\n  to attorney\u2019s fees, punitive damages, or injunctive relief. Petitioner\n  filed two \u00a71983 damages actions against correction employees in\n  state court. Finding that it lacked jurisdiction under Correction Law\n  \u00a724, the trial court dismissed the actions. Affirming, the State Court\n  of Appeals rejected petitioner\u2019s claim that the state statute\u2019s jurisdic\n  tional limitation violated the Supremacy Clause. It reasoned that be\n  cause that law treats state and federal damages actions against cor\n  rection officers equally\u2014i.e., neither can be brought in New York\n  courts\u2014it was a neutral rule of judicial administration and thus a\n  valid excuse for the State\u2019s refusal to entertain the federal cause of\n  action.\nHeld: Correction Law \u00a724, as applied to \u00a71983 claims, violates the Su\n premacy Clause. Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (a) Federal and state law \u201ctogether form one system of jurispru\n dence, which constitutes the law of the land for the State; and the\n courts of the two jurisdictions are . . . courts of the same country, hav\n ing jurisdiction partly different and partly concurrent.\u201d Claflin v.\n Houseman, 93 U.

Whatever its\n    merits, New York\u2019s policy of shielding correction officers from liability\n    when sued for damages arising out of conduct performed in the scope\n    of their employment is contrary to Congress\u2019 judgment that all per\n    sons who violate federal rights while acting under color of state law\n    shall be held liable for damages. \u201cA State may not . . . relieve conges\n    tion in its courts by declaring a whole category of federal claims to be\n    frivolous.\u201d Id., at 380. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) The New York Court of Appeals\u2019 holding was based on the mis\n    understanding that Correction Law \u00a724\u2019s equal treatment of federal\n    and state claims would guarantee that the statute would pass consti\n    tutional muster. Although the absence of discrimination is essential\n    to this Court\u2019s finding a state law neutral, nondiscrimination alone is\n    not sufficient to guarantee that a state law will be deemed neutral.\n    In addition to this misplaced reliance on equality, respondents mis\n    takenly treat this case as implicating the \u201cgreat latitude [States en\n    joy] to establish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\u201d\n    Howlett, 496 U.

However, this Court need not decide\n    whether Congress can compel a State to offer a forum, otherwise un\n    available under state law, to hear \u00a71983 suits, because New York has\n    courts of general jurisdiction that routinely sit to hear analogous\n    \u00a71983 actions.

S. C. \u00a71983, the statute that creates a remedy\nfor violations of federal rights committed by persons acting\nunder color of state law.1 While that rule is generally\napplicable to New York\u2019s supreme courts\u2014the State\u2019s trial\ncourts of general jurisdiction\u2014New York\u2019s Correction Law\n\u00a724 divests those courts of jurisdiction over \u00a71983 suits\nthat seek money damages from correction officers. New\nYork thus prohibits the trial courts that generally exercise\njurisdiction over \u00a71983 suits brought against other state\nofficials from hearing virtually all such suits brought\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, as\n\namended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, provides in relevant part:\n  \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,\ncustom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,\nsubjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or\nother person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any\nrights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,\nshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or\nother proper proceeding for redress.\u201d\n2                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst state correction officers. The question presented is\nwhether that exceptional treatment of a limited category of\n\u00a71983 claims is consistent with the Supremacy Clause of\nthe United States Constitution. 2\n                              I\n   Petitioner, an inmate in New York\u2019s Attica Correctional\nFacility, commenced two \u00a71983 actions against several\ncorrection employees alleging that they violated his civil\nrights in connection with three prisoner disciplinary pro\nceedings and an altercation. Proceeding pro se, petitioner\nfiled his claims in State Supreme Court and sought puni\ntive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court dis\nmissed the actions on the ground that, under N. Y. Cor\nrect. Law Ann. \u00a724 (West 1987) (hereinafter Correction\nLaw \u00a724), it lacked jurisdiction to entertain any suit aris\ning under state or federal law seeking money damages\nfrom correction officers for actions taken in the scope of\ntheir employment.      The intermediate appellate court\nsummarily affirmed the trial court. 35 App. Div. 3d 1290,\n826 N. Y. S. 2d 542 (2006).\n   The New York Court of Appeals, by a 4-to-3 vote, also\naffirmed the dismissal of petitioner\u2019s damages action. The\nCourt of Appeals rejected petitioner\u2019s argument that Cor\nrection Law \u00a724\u2019s jurisdictional limitation interfered with\n\u00a71983 and therefore ran afoul of the Supremacy Clause of\nthe United States Constitution. The majority reasoned\nthat, because Correction Law \u00a724 treats state and federal\ndamages actions against correction officers equally (that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n       Supremacy Clause, Art.

Y. 3d, at 488, 881 N. E. 2d, at 184. So read, discrimi\nnation vel non is the focal point of Supremacy Clause\nanalysis.\n   In dissent, Judge Jones argued that Correction Law \u00a724\nis not a neutral rule of judicial administration. Noting\nthat the State\u2019s trial courts handle all other \u00a71983 dam\nages actions, he concluded that the State had created\ncourts of competent jurisdiction to entertain \u00a71983 suits.\nIn his view, \u201conce a state opens its courts to hear section\n1983 actions, it may not selectively exclude section 1983\nactions by denominating state policies as jurisdictional.\u201d\nId., at 497, 881 N.

DROWN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nits courts of jurisdiction over such damages claims and to\nreplace those claims with the State\u2019s preferred alternative.\nThe provision states in full:\n       \u201c1. No civil action shall be brought in any court of\n     the state, except by the attorney general on behalf of\n     the state, against any officer or employee of the de\n     partment, in his personal capacity, for damages aris\n     ing out of any act done or the failure to perform any\n     act within the scope of employment and in the dis\n     charge of the duties by such officer or employee.\n       \u201c2. Any claim for damages arising out of any act\n     done or the failure to perform any act within the scope\n     of employment and in the discharge of the duties of\n     any officer or employee of the department shall be\n     brought and maintained in the court of claims as a\n     claim against the state.\u201d\nThus, under this scheme, a prisoner seeking damages from\na correction officer will have his claim dismissed for want\nof jurisdiction and will be left, instead, to pursue a claim\nfor damages against an entirely different party (the State)\nin the Court of Claims\u2014a court of limited jurisdiction.4\nSee N. Y. Const., Art. VI, \u00a79; N. Y. Ct. Clms. Law Ann. \u00a79\n(West 1989) (hereinafter Court of Claims Act).\n  For prisoners seeking redress, pursuing the Court of\nClaims alternative comes with strict conditions.

Hamilton) (\u201c[T]he inference seems to be conclu\nsive, that the State courts would have a concurrent juris\ndiction in all cases arising under the laws of the Union,\nwhere it was not expressly prohibited\u201d). Although \u00a71983,\na Reconstruction-era statute, was passed \u201cto interpose the\nfederal courts between the States and the people, as\nguardians of the people\u2019s federal rights,\u201d Mitchum v. Fos\nter, 407 U. S. 225, 242 (1972), state courts as well as fed\neral courts are entrusted with providing a forum for the\nvindication of federal rights violated by state or local\nofficials acting under color of state law. See Patsy v.\n6                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBoard of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 506\u2013507 (1982)\n(canvassing the legislative debates of the 1871 Congress\nand noting that \u201cmany legislators interpreted [\u00a71983] to\nprovide dual or concurrent forums in the state and federal\nsystem, enabling the plaintiff to choose the forum in which\nto seek relief\u201d); Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 3, n. 1\n(1980).\n   So strong is the presumption of concurrency that it is\ndefeated only in two narrowly defined circumstances: first,\nwhen Congress expressly ousts state courts of jurisdiction,\nsee Bombolis, 241 U. S., at 221; Claflin, 93 U. S., at 136;\nand second, \u201c[w]hen a state court refuses jurisdiction\nbecause of a neutral state rule regarding the administra\ntion of the courts,\u201d Howlett, 496 U. S., at 372. Focusing on\nthe latter circumstance, we have emphasized that only a\nneutral jurisdictional rule will be deemed a \u201cvalid excuse\u201d\nfor departing from the default assumption that \u201cstate\ncourts have inherent authority, and are thus presump\ntively competent, to adjudicate claims arising under the\nlaws of the United States.\u201d Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455,\n458 (1990).\n   In determining whether a state law qualifies as a neu\ntral rule of judicial administration, our cases have estab\nlished that a State cannot employ a jurisdictional rule \u201cto\ndissociate [itself] from federal law because of disagreement\nwith its content or a refusal to recognize the superior\nauthority of its source.\u201d Howlett, 496 U. S., at 371. In\nother words, although States retain substantial leeway to\nestablish the contours of their judicial systems, they lack\nauthority to nullify a federal right or cause of action they\nbelieve is inconsistent with their local policies. \u201cThe sug\ngestion that [an] act of Congress is not in harmony with\nthe policy of the State, and therefore that the courts of the\nState are free to decline jurisdiction, is quite inadmissible,\nbecause it presupposes what in legal contemplation does\nnot exist.\u201d Second Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1,\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

In passing Correction\nLaw \u00a724, New York made the judgment that correction\nofficers should not be burdened with suits for damages\narising out of conduct performed in the scope of their\nemployment. Because it regards these suits as too numer\nous or too frivolous (or both), the State\u2019s longstanding\npolicy has been to shield this narrow class of defendants\nfrom liability when sued for damages.5 The State\u2019s policy,\nwhatever its merits, is contrary to Congress\u2019 judgment\nthat all persons who violate federal rights while acting\nunder color of state law shall be held liable for damages.\nAs we have unanimously recognized, \u201c[a] State may not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 In many respects, Correction Law \u00a724 operates more as an immu\nnity-from-damages provision than as a jurisdictional rule. Indeed, the\noriginal version of the statute gave correction officers qualified immu\nnity, providing that no officer would be \u201cliable for damages if he shall\nhave acted in good faith, with reasonable care and upon probable\ncause.\u201d N. Y. Correct. Law. \u00a76\u2013b (McKinney Supp. 1947). And, more\nrecently, a state legislative proposal seeking to extend Correction Law\n\u00a724\u2019s scheme to other state employees explained that its purpose was to\ngrant \u201cthe same immunity from civil damage actions as all other State\nemployees who work in the prisons.\u201d App. 85.\n  In Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356 (1990), we considered the question\nwhether a Florida school board could assert a state-law immunity\ndefense in a \u00a71983 action brought in state court when the defense\nwould not have been available if the action had been brought in federal\ncourt. We unanimously held that the State\u2019s decision to extend immu\nnity \u201cover and above [that which is] already provided in \u00a71983 . . .\ndirectly violates federal law,\u201d and explained that the \u201celements of, and\nthe defenses to, a federal cause of action are defined by federal law.\u201d\nId., at 375; Owen v. Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 647, n. 30 (1980); see\nalso R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart & Wechsler\u2019s The Fed\neral Courts and the Federal System 1122 (5th ed. 2003) (\u201cFederal law\ngoverns the immunity in [\u00a71983] actions, even when brought against\nstate officials\u201d). Thus, if Correction Law \u00a724 were understood as\noffering an immunity defense, Howlett would compel the conclusion\nthat it violates the Supremacy Clause.\n8                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . relieve congestion in its courts by declaring a whole\ncategory of federal claims to be frivolous. Until it has been\nproved that the claim has no merit, that judgment is not\nup to the States to make.\u201d Howlett, 496 U. S., at 380;\nBurnett v. Grattan, 468 U. S. 42, 55 (1984) (rejecting as\n\u201cmanifestly inconsistent with the central objective of the\nReconstruction\u2013Era civil rights statutes\u201d the judgment\n\u201cthat factors such as minimizing the diversion of state\nofficials\u2019 attention from their duties outweigh the interest\nin providing employees ready access to a forum to resolve\nvalid claims\u201d). That New York strongly favors a rule\nshielding correction officers from personal damages liabil\nity and substituting the State as the party responsible for\ncompensating individual victims is irrelevant. The State\ncannot condition its enforcement of federal law on the\ndemand that those individuals whose conduct federal law\nseeks to regulate must nevertheless escape liability.\n                             IV\n   While our cases have uniformly applied the principle\nthat a State cannot simply refuse to entertain a federal\nclaim based on a policy disagreement, we have yet to\nconfront a statute like New York\u2019s that registers its dis\nsent by divesting its courts of jurisdiction over a disfa\nvored federal claim in addition to an identical state claim.\nThe New York Court of Appeals\u2019 holding was based on the\nmisunderstanding that this equal treatment of federal\nand state claims rendered Correction Law \u00a724 constitu\ntional. 9 N. Y. 3d, at 489, 881 N. E. 2d, at 185 (\u201cPut sim\nply, because Correction Law \u00a724 does not treat section\n1983 claims differently than it treats related state law\ncauses of action, the Supremacy Clause is not offended\u201d).\nTo the extent our cases have created this misperception,\nwe now make clear that equality of treatment does not\nensure that a state law will be deemed a neutral rule of\njudicial administration and therefore a valid excuse for\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrefusing to entertain a federal cause of action.\n  Respondents correctly observe that, in the handful of\ncases in which this Court has found a valid excuse, the\nstate rule at issue treated state and federal claims\nequally. In Douglas v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279\nU. S. 377 (1929), we upheld a state law that granted state\ncourts discretion to decline jurisdiction over state and\nfederal claims alike when neither party was a resident of\nthe State. Later, in Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117 (1945),\na city court dismissed an action brought under the Federal\nEmployers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. \u00a751 et seq.,\nfor want of jurisdiction because the cause of action arose\noutside the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. We upheld the\ndismissal on the ground that the State\u2019s venue laws were\nnot being applied in a way that discriminated against the\nfederal claim. 324 U. S., at 123. In a third case, Missouri\nex rel. Southern R. Co. v. Mayfield, 340 U. S. 1 (1950), we\nheld that a State\u2019s application of the forum non conveniens\ndoctrine to bar adjudication of a FELA case brought by\nnonresidents was constitutionally sound as long as the\npolicy was enforced impartially. Id., at 4. And our most\nrecent decision finding a valid excuse, Johnson v. Fankell,\n520 U. S. 911 (1997), rested largely on the fact that\nIdaho\u2019s rule limiting interlocutory jurisdiction did not\ndiscriminate against \u00a71983 actions. See id., at 918.\n  Although the absence of discrimination is necessary to\nour finding a state law neutral, it is not sufficient. A\njurisdictional rule cannot be used as a device to undermine\nfederal law, no matter how evenhanded it may appear. As\nwe made clear in Howlett, \u201c[t]he fact that a rule is de\nnominated jurisdictional does not provide a court an ex\ncuse to avoid the obligation to enforce federal law if the\nrule does not reflect the concerns of power over the person\nand competence over the subject matter that jurisdictional\nrules are designed to protect.\u201d 496 U. S., at 381. Ensuring\nequality of treatment is thus the beginning, not the end, of\n10                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Supremacy Clause analysis.\n   In addition to giving too much weight to equality of\ntreatment, respondents mistakenly treat this case as\nimplicating the \u201cgreat latitude [States enjoy] to establish\nthe structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\u201d Id., at\n372. Although Correction Law \u00a724 denies state courts\nauthority to entertain damages actions against correction\nofficers, this case does not require us to decide whether\nCongress may compel a State to offer a forum, otherwise\nunavailable under state law, to hear suits brought pursu\nant to \u00a71983. The State of New York has made this in\nquiry unnecessary by creating courts of general jurisdic\ntion that routinely sit to hear analogous \u00a71983 actions.\nNew York\u2019s constitution vests the state supreme courts\nwith general original jurisdiction, N. Y. Const., Art. VI,\n\u00a77(a), and the \u201cinviolate authority to hear and resolve all\ncauses in law and equity.\u201d Pollicina v. Misericordia Hos\npital Medical Center, 82 N. Y. 2d 332, 339, 624 N. E. 2d\n974, 977 (1993). For instance, if petitioner had attempted\nto sue a police officer for damages under \u00a71983, the suit\nwould be properly adjudicated by a state supreme court.\nSimilarly, if petitioner had sought declaratory or injunc\ntive relief against a correction officer, that suit would be\nheard in a state supreme court. It is only a particular\nspecies of suits\u2014those seeking damages relief against\ncorrection officers\u2014that the State deems inappropriate for\nits trial courts.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 While we have looked to a State\u2019s \u201ccommon-law tort analogues\u201d in\n\ndeciding whether a state procedural rule is neutral, see Felder v. Casey,\n487 U. S. 131, 146, n. 3 (1988), we have never equated \u201canalogous\nclaims\u201d with \u201cidentical claims.\u201d Instead, we have searched for a similar\nclaim under state law to determine whether a State has established\ncourts of adequate and appropriate jurisdiction capable of hearing a\n\u00a71983 suit. See Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 388, 394 (1947); Martinez\nv. California, 444 U. S. 277, 283\u2013284, n. 7 (1980) (\u201c[W]here the same\ntype of claim, if arising under state law, would be enforced in the state\ncourts, the state courts are generally not free to refuse enforcement of\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  We therefore hold that, having made the decision to\ncreate courts of general jurisdiction that regularly sit to\nentertain analogous suits, New York is not at liberty to\nshut the courthouse door to federal claims that it considers\nat odds with its local policy.7 A State\u2019s authority to organ\nize its courts, while considerable, remains subject to the\nstrictures of the Constitution. See, e.g., McKnett v.\nSt. Louis & San Francisco R. Co., 292 U. S. 230, 233\n(1934). We have never treated a State\u2019s invocation of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe federal claim\u201d (emphasis added)). Section 1983 damages claims\nagainst other state officials and equitable claims against correction\nofficers are both sufficiently analogous to petitioner\u2019s \u00a71983 claims.\n   7 The dissent\u2019s contrary view is based on its belief that \u201cStates have\n\nunfettered authority to determine whether their local courts may\nentertain a federal cause of action.\u201d Post, at 8 (opinion of THOMAS, J.).\nBut this theory of the Supremacy Clause was raised and squarely\nrejected in Howlett. Respondents in that case \u201cargued that a federal\ncourt has no power to compel a state court to entertain a claim over\nwhich the state court has no jurisdiction as a matter of state law.\u201d 496\nU. S., at 381; see also Brief for National Association of Counties et al.\nas Amici Curiae in Howlett v. Rose, O. T. 1989, No. 89\u20135383, pp. 11\u201313\n(\u201c[S]tate courts are under no obligation to disregard even-handed\njurisdictional limitations that exclude both state and federal claims\u201d).\nWe declared that this argument had \u201cno merit\u201d and explained that it\nignored other provisions of the Constitution, including the Full Faith\nand Credit Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which\ncompel States to open their courts to causes of action over which they\nwould normally lack jurisdiction. See 496 U. S., at 381\u2013382; see also\nHughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609, 611 (1951) (interpreting the Full Faith\nand Credit Clause and concluding that a State cannot \u201cescape [its]\nconstitutional obligation to enforce the rights and duties validly created\nunder the laws of other states by the simple device of removing jurisdic\ntion from courts otherwise competent\u201d); Angel v. Bullington, 330 U. S.\n183, 188 (1947) (noting that the Constitution may \u201cfetter the freedom of\na State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such\nwithdrawal of jurisdiction \u2018the adjective law of the State\u2019, or the exer\ncise of its right to regulate \u2018the practice and procedure\u2019 of its courts\u201d).\nWe saw no reason to treat the Supremacy Clause differently. Howlett,\n496 U. S., at 382\u2013383. Thus, to the extent the dissent resurrects this\nargument, we again reject it.\n12                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cjurisdiction\u201d as a trump that ends the Supremacy Clause\ninquiry, see Howlett, 496 U. S., at 382\u2013383, and we decline\nto do so in this case. Because New York\u2019s supreme courts\ngenerally have personal jurisdiction over the parties in\n\u00a71983 suits brought by prisoners against correction offi\ncers and because they hear the lion\u2019s share of all other\n\u00a71983 actions, we find little concerning \u201cpower over the\nperson and competence over the subject matter\u201d in Correc\ntion Law \u00a724. Id., at 381; see id., at 378 (conducting a\nsimilar analysis and concluding that the Florida courts of\ngeneral jurisdiction were \u201cfully competent to provide the\nremedies [\u00a71983] requires\u201d).8\n   Accordingly, the dissent\u2019s fear that \u201cno state jurisdic\ntional rule will be upheld as constitutional\u201d is entirely\nunfounded. Post, at 29, n. 10. Our holding addresses only\nthe unique scheme adopted by the State of New York\u2014a\nlaw designed to shield a particular class of defendants\n(correction officers) from a particular type of liability\n(damages) brought by a particular class of plaintiffs (pris\noners). Based on the belief that damages suits against\ncorrection officers are frivolous and vexatious, see supra,\nat 3\u20134, n. 3, Correction Law \u00a724 is effectively an immu\nnity statute cloaked in jurisdictional garb. Finding this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The  dissent\u2019s proposed solution would create a blind spot in the Su\npremacy Clause. If New York had decided to employ a procedural rule\nto burden the enforcement of federal law, the dissent would find the\nscheme unconstitutional. Yet simply because New York has decided to\nimpose an even greater burden on a federal cause of action by selectively\nwithdrawing the jurisdiction of its courts, the dissent detects no consti\ntutional violation. Thus, in the dissent\u2019s conception of the Supremacy\nClause, a State could express its disagreement with (and even open\nhostility to) a federal cause of action, declare a desire to thwart its\nenforcement, and achieve that goal by removing the disfavored category\nof claims from its courts\u2019 jurisdiction. If this view were adopted, the\nlesson of our precedents would be that other States with unconstitution\nally burdensome procedural rules did not go far enough \u201cto avoid the\nobligation to enforce federal law.\u201d Howlett, 469 U.

Article III, \u00a71,\nprovides that \u201c[t]he judicial Power of the United States,\nshall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior\nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and\nestablish.\u201d The history of the drafting and ratification of\nthis Article establishes that it leaves untouched the\nStates\u2019 plenary authority to decide whether their local\ncourts will have subject-matter jurisdiction over federal\ncauses of action.\n2                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   The text of Article III reflects the Framers\u2019 agreement\nthat the National Government needed a Supreme Court.\nThere was sharp disagreement at the Philadelphia Con\u00ad\nvention, however, over the need for lower federal courts.\nSeveral of the Framers, most notably James Madison,\nfavored a strong central government that included lower\nfederal tribunals. Under the Virginia Plan, the Constitu\u00ad\ntion would have established a \u201cNational Judiciary . . . to\nconsist of one or more supreme tribunals, and of inferior\ntribunals to be chosen by the National Legislature.\u201d 1\nRecords of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 21 (M. Far\u00ad\nrand ed. 1911) (hereinafter Farrand). A revised version of\nthe proposal, which stated that the National Judiciary\nwould \u201c \u2018consist of One supreme tribunal, and of one or\nmore inferior tribunals,\u2019 \u201d was approved on June 4, 1787.\nId., at 95.\n   The following day, however, John Rutledge raised an\nobjection to \u201cestablishing any national tribunal except a\nsingle supreme one.\u201d Id., at 119. He proposed striking the\nlanguage providing for the creation of lower federal courts\nbecause state courts were \u201cmost proper\u201d for deciding \u201call\ncases in the first instance.\u201d Ibid. According to Rutledge,\n\u201cthe right of appeal to the supreme national tribunal [was]\nsufficient to secure the national rights [and] uniformity of\nJudgm[en]ts,\u201d and the lower federal courts were thus an\n\u201cunnecessary encroachment\u201d on the sovereign prerogative\nof the States to adjudicate federal claims.

He\ncountered that \u201cinferior [federal] tribunals . . . dispersed\nthroughout the Republic\u201d were necessary to meet the\nneeds of the newly formed government: \u201cAn effective\nJudiciary establishment commensurate to the legislative\nauthority [is] essential.

Over continued objections\nthat such courts were an unnecessary expense and an\naffront to the States, the scaled-back version of the Vir\u00ad\nginia Plan passed. Ibid.\n   On June 15, 1787, however, the New Jersey Plan was\nintroduced. Although it did not directly challenge the\ndecision to permit Congress to \u201cinstitute\u201d inferior federal\ncourts, the plan, among other things, required state courts\nto adjudicate federal claims. Id., at 125, 243. In particu\u00ad\nlar, the plan provided that, except for cases of impeach\u00ad\nment (over which the Supreme Court would have original\njurisdiction), \u201call punishments, fines, forfeitures [and]\npenalties . . . shall be adjudged by the Common law Judi\u00ad\nciar[ies] of the State in which any offence contrary to the\ntrue intent [and] meaning of [federal law] shall have been\ncommitted or perpetrated, with liberty of commencing in\nthe first instance all suits [and] prosecutions for that\npurpose in the superior Common law Judiciary in such\nState, subject nevertheless, for the correction of all errors,\nboth in law [and] fact in rendering judgment, to an appeal\nto the Judiciary of the U[nited] States.\u201d Id., at 243, 244.\n   The introduction of the New Jersey Plan reignited the\ndebate over the need for lower federal courts.

The Committee amended the proposal\u2019s\nlanguage to its current form in Article III, which gives\nCongress the power to \u201cordain and establish\u201d inferior\nfederal courts. See id., at 168. The delegates to the Con\u00ad\nstitutional Convention unanimously adopted this revised\nversion, see id., at 315, and it was ultimately ratified by\nthe States.\n   This so-called Madisonian Compromise bridged the\ndivide \u201cbetween those who thought that the establishment\nof lower federal courts should be constitutionally manda\u00ad\ntory and those who thought there should be no federal\ncourts at all except for a Supreme Court with, inter alia,\nappellate jurisdiction to review state court judgments.\u201d R.\nFallon, D.

Rev. 545,\n547 (1925) (footnote omitted).\n  The assumption that state courts would continue to\nexercise concurrent jurisdiction over federal claims was\nessential to this compromise. See The Federalist No. 82,\npp. 130, 132 (E. Bourne ed. 1947) (A. Hamilton) (\u201c[T]he\ninference seems to be conclusive, that the State courts\nwould have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising\nunder the laws of the Union, where it was not expressly\nprohibited\u201d).1 In light of that historical understanding,\nthis Court has held that, absent an Act of Congress provid\u00ad\ning for exclusive jurisdiction in the lower federal courts,\nthe \u201cstate courts have inherent authority, and are thus\npresumptively competent, to adjudicate claims arising\nunder the laws of the United States.\u201d Tafflin v.

See ante, at 5 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).\nHe merely understood that the States would be \u201cdivested of no part of\ntheir primitive jurisdiction\u201d and state courts \u201cin every case in which\nthey were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national\nlegislature . . . [would] of course take cognizance of the causes to which\nthose acts may give birth.\u201d The Federalist No. 82, at 132. Hamilton\nthus assumed that state courts would continue to entertain federal\nclaims consistent with their \u201cprimitive jurisdiction\u201d under state law.\nIbid. But he remained skeptical that state courts could be forced to\nentertain federal causes of action when state law deprived them of\njurisdiction over such claims. See Hamilton, The Examination No. 6,\n(Jan. 2, 1802), in 25 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 484, 487\u2013488 (H.\nSyrett ed. 1977) (\u201c[I]t is not to be forgotten, that the right to employ the\nagency of the State Courts for executing the laws of the Union, is liable\nto question, and has, in fact, been seriously questioned\u201d).\n6                   HAYWOOD v.

Kent, Commentaries on\nAmerican Law 374\u2013375 (1826) (hereinafter Kent))). As a\nresult, \u201cif exclusive jurisdiction [in the federal courts] be\nneither express nor implied, the State courts have concur\u00ad\nrent jurisdiction whenever, by their own constitution, they\nare competent to take it.\u201d Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S.\n130, 136 (1876).\n    The Constitution\u2019s implicit preservation of state author\u00ad\nity to entertain federal claims, however, did not impose a\nduty on state courts to do so. As discussed above, there\nwas at least one proposal to expressly require state courts\nto take original jurisdiction over federal claims (subject to\nappeal in federal court) that was introduced in an attempt\nto forestall the creation of lower federal courts. See supra,\nat 3\u20134. But in light of the failure of this proposal\u2014which\nwas offered before the adoption of the Madisonian Com\u00ad\npromise\u2014the assertions by its supporters that state courts\nwould ordinarily entertain federal causes of action cannot\nreasonably be viewed as an assurance that the States\nwould never alter the subject-matter jurisdiction of their\ncourts. The Framers\u2019 decision to empower Congress to\ncreate federal courts that could either supplement or\ndisplace state-court review of federal claims, as well as the\nexclusion of any affirmative command requiring the States\nto consider federal claims in the text of Article III, confirm\nthis understanding.

In short, there was \u201ca very clear\nintimation given by the judges of the Supreme Court, that\nthe state courts were not bound in consequence of any act\nof congress, to assume and exercise jurisdiction in such\ncases. It was merely permitted to them to do so as far, as\nwas compatible with their state obligations.\u201d Kent 375;\nsee also id., at 377 (explaining that the Constitution \u201cper\u00ad\nmits state courts which are competent for the purpose, and\nhave an inherent jurisdiction adequate to the case, to\nentertain suits in the given cases\u201d).\n   Under our federal system, therefore, the States have\nunfettered authority to determine whether their local\ncourts may entertain a federal cause of action. Once a\nState exercises its sovereign prerogative to deprive its\ncourts of subject-matter jurisdiction over a federal cause of\naction, it is the end of the matter as far as the Constitu\u00ad\ntion is concerned.\n   The present case can be resolved under this principle\nalone. New York Correction Law Annotated \u00a724, \u00b61 (West\n1987) (NYCLA) provides that \u201c[n]o civil action shall be\nbrought in any court of the state, except by the attorney\ngeneral on behalf of the state, against any officer or em\u00ad\nployee of the department, in his personal capacity, for\ndamages arising out of any act done or the failure to per\u00ad\nform any act within the scope of the employment and in\nthe discharge of the duties by such officer or employee.\u201d\nThe majority and petitioner agree that this statute erects\na jurisdictional bar that prevents the state courts from\nentertaining petitioner\u2019s claim for damages under \u00a71983.\nSee ante, at 4 (agreeing that \u201ca prisoner seeking damages\nfrom a correction officer will have his claim dismissed for\nwant of jurisdiction\u201d); Brief for Petitioner 21 (\u201cEvery New\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Because New York\u2019s\ndecision to withdraw jurisdiction over \u00a71983 damages\nactions\u2014or indeed, over any claims\u2014does not offend the\nConstitution, the judgment below should be affirmed.\n                             II\n   The Court has evaded Article III\u2019s limitations by finding\nthat the Supremacy Clause constrains the States\u2019 author\u00ad\nity to define the subject-matter jurisdiction of their own\ncourts. See ante, at 5\u20138. In particular, the Court has held\nthat \u201cthe Federal Constitution prohibits state courts of\ngeneral jurisdiction from refusing\u201d to entertain a federal\nclaim \u201csolely because the suit is brought under a federal\nlaw\u201d as a \u201cstate may not discriminate against rights aris\u00ad\ning under federal laws.\u201d McKnett v.

DROWN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n(1884). Thus, a valid federal law is substantively superior\nto a state law; \u201cif a state measure conflicts with a federal\nrequirement, the state provision must give way.\u201d Swift &\nCo. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 120 (1965). As a textual\nmatter, however, the Supremacy Clause does not address\nwhether a state court must entertain a federal cause of\naction; it provides only a rule of decision that the state\ncourt must follow if it adjudicates the claim. See R. Ber\u00ad\nger, Congress v. The Supreme Court 245 (1969) (The\nSupremacy Clause only \u201c \u2018enacts what the law shall be\u2019. . . .\n[I]t defines the governing \u2018supreme law,\u2019 and if a State\ncourt has jurisdiction, it commands that that law shall\ngovern\u201d).\n   The Supremacy Clause\u2019s path to adoption at the Con\u00ad\nvention confirms this focus. Its precursor was introduced\nas part of the New Jersey Plan. See 1 Farrand 245 (\u201c[A]ll\nActs of . . . Cong[ress] made by virtue [and] in pursuance\nof the powers hereby . . . vested in them . . . shall be the\nsupreme law of the respective States so far forth as those\nActs . . . shall relate to the said States or their Citizens\u201d);\nibid. (\u201c[T]he Judiciary of the several States shall be bound\nthereby in their decisions, any thing in the respective laws\nof the Individual States . . . notwithstanding\u201d). But, as\nexplained above, see supra, at 3\u20134, the New Jersey Plan\nalso included an entirely separate provision that ad\u00ad\ndressed state-court jurisdiction, which would have re\u00ad\nquired all federal questions to \u201cb[e] determined in the first\ninstance in the courts of the respective states.\u201d 3 Farrand\n287. These two provisions of the New Jersey Plan worked\nin tandem to require state courts to entertain federal\nclaims and to decide the substantive dispute in favor of\nfederal law if a conflict between the two arose.\n   After the adoption of the Madisonian Compromise and\nthe defeat of the New Jersey Plan, the Framers returned\nto the question of federal supremacy. A proposal was\nintroduced granting Congress the power to \u201c \u2018negative all\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    11\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlaws passed by the several States (contravening in the\nopinion of [Congress] the articles of Union, or any treaties\nsubsisting under the authority of [Congress]).\u2019 \u201d 2 id., at\n27. James Madison believed the proposal \u201cessential to the\nefficacy [and] security of the [federal] Gov[ernmen]t.\u201d\nIbid. But others at the Convention, including Roger\nSherman, \u201cthought it unnecessary, as the Courts of the\nStates would not consider as valid any law contravening\nthe Authority of the Union, and which the legislature\nwould wish to be negatived.\u201d Ibid. In the end, Madison\u2019s\nproposal was defeated. Id., at 28. But as a substitute for\nthat rejected proposal, Luther Martin resurrected the\nSupremacy Clause provision from the New Jersey Plan\nand it was unanimously approved. See id., at 28\u201329.3\n  This historical record makes clear that the Supremacy\nClause\u2019s exclusive function is to disable state laws that are\nsubstantively inconsistent with federal law\u2014not to re\u00ad\nquire state courts to hear federal claims over which the\ncourts lack jurisdiction. This was necessarily the case\nwhen the clause was first introduced as part of the New\nJersey Plan, as it included a separate provision to confront\nthe jurisdictional question. Had that plan prevailed and\nbeen ratified by the States, construing the Supremacy\nClause to address state-court jurisdiction would have\nrendered the separate jurisdictional component of the New\nJersey Plan mere surplusage. See Marbury v. Madison, 1\nCranch 137, 174 (1803) (\u201cIt cannot be presumed that any\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 As proposed by Luther Martin, the Clause provided as follows:\n\n\u201c \u2018[T]hat the Legislative acts of the [United States] made by virtue [and]\nin pursuance of the articles of Union, and all treaties made [and]\nratified under the authority of the [United States] shall be the supreme\nlaw of the respective States, as far as those acts or treaties shall relate\nto the said States, or their Citizens and inhabitants\u2014[and] that the\nJudiciaries of the several States shall be bound thereby in their deci\u00ad\nsions, any thing in the respective laws of the individual States to the\ncontrary notwithstanding.\u2019 \u201d 2 Farrand 28\u201329.\n12                       HAYWOOD v.

S. 469, 507\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  The Supremacy Clause\u2019s exclusive focus on substantive\nstate law is also evident from the context in which it was\nrevived. First, the Clause was not adopted until after the\nNew Jersey Plan\u2019s rejection, as part of the entirely sepa\u00ad\nrate debate over Madison\u2019s proposal to grant Congress the\npower to \u201cnegative\u201d the laws of the States. By then, the\nFramers had already adopted Article III, thereby ending\nthe fight over state-court jurisdiction. The question before\nthe Convention thus was not which courts (state or fed\u00ad\neral) were best suited to adjudicate federal claims, but\nwhich branch of government (Congress or the courts)\nwould be most effective in vindicating the substantive\nsuperiority of federal law. The Supremacy Clause was\ndirectly responsive to that question.\n  Second, the timing of the Clause\u2019s adoption suggests\nthat the Framers viewed it as achieving the same end as\nMadison\u2019s congressional \u201cnegative\u201d proposal. Although\nMadison believed that Congress could most effectively\ncountermand inconsistent state laws,4 the Framers de\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Madison did not believe that federal courts were up to the task. See\n\nLetter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 24, 1787),\nreprinted in 3 id., at 131, 134 (\u201cIt may be said that the Judicial author\u00ad\nity, under our new system will keep the States within their proper\nlimits, and supply the place of a negative on their laws. The answer is,\nthat it is more convenient to prevent the passage of a law than to\ndeclare it void after it is passed; that this will be particularly the case,\nwhere the law aggrieves individuals, who may be unable to support an\nappeal [against] a State to the supreme Judiciary; that a State which\nwould violate the Legislative rights of the Union, would not be very\nready to obey a Judicial decree in support of them, and that a recur\u00ad\nrence to force, which, in the event of disobedience would be necessary,\nis an evil which the new Constitution meant to exclude as far as possi\u00ad\nble\u201d). He had even less faith in state courts. See 2 id., at 27\u201328 (\u201cCon\u00ad\nfidence can (not) be put in the State Tribunals as guardians of the\nNational authority and interests\u201d).

There is no evidence that the Framers envi\u00ad\nsioned the Supremacy Clause as having a substantively\nbroader sweep than the proposal it replaced. And, there\ncan be no question that Madison\u2019s congressional \u201cnegative\u201d\nproposal was entirely unconcerned with the dispute over\nwhether state courts should be required to exercise juris\u00ad\ndiction over federal claims. Indeed, Madison\u2019s proposal\ndid not require the States to become enmeshed in any\nfederal business at all; it merely provided that state laws\ncould be directly nullified if Congress found them to be\ninconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates. The role of the Supremacy Clause is no different.\nIt does not require state courts to entertain federal causes\nof action. Rather, it only requires that in reaching the\nmerits of such claims, state courts must decide the legal\nquestion in favor of the \u201claw of the Land.\u201d Art. VI, cl. 2.\n   For this reason, Representative Fisher Ames explained\nduring the debate over the First Judiciary Act that \u201c[t]he\nlaw of the United States is a rule to [state-court judges],\nbut no authority for them. It controlled their decisions,\nbut could not enlarge their powers.\u201d 1 Annals of Congress\n808 (1789) (reprint 2003). And because the Constitution\nrequires from state judges only an oath of \u201cAllegiance and\nnot an Oath of Office,\u201d the federal government \u201c[c]annot\ncompel them to act\u2014or to become our Officers.\u201d Notes of\nWilliam Patterson from Speech on Judiciary Act (June 23,\n1789), in 9 Documentary History of the First Federal\nCongress 1789\u20131791, p. 477 (K.

Madison appears to have preferred that the state courts hear\nas little federal business as possible.\n14                      HAYWOOD v.

Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 381\u2013382 (1990)).\nBut the majority has it backwards. The Full Faith and Credit Clause\nand the Privileges and Immunities Clause include a textual prohibition\non discrimination that the Supremacy Clause lacks. See Art. IV, \u00a71\n(\u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,\nRecords, and judicial Proceedings of every other State\u201d); Art. IV, \u00a72\n(\u201cThe Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and\nImmunities of Citizens in the several States\u201d). The Framers\u2019 decision\nto address state-to-state discrimination in these two clauses without\ntaking similar steps with respect to federal-state relations governed by\nthe Supremacy Clause aligns with reasons given for abandoning the\nArticles of Confederation, see The Federalist No. 42, p. 292 (E. Bourne\ned. 1947) (J. Madison) (describing the Full Faith and Credit Clause as\n\u201can evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this\nsubject in the articles of Confederation\u201d), and the principle of dual\nsovereignty that the Constitution preserves, see Texas v.

Accordingly, contrary to the majority\u2019s supposition,\nthere are in fact strong \u201creason[s] to treat the Supremacy Clause\ndifferently,\u201d ante, at 11, n. 7, from the Full Faith and Credit and\nPrivileges and Immunities Clauses.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npute. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523\nU. S. 83, 94 (1998) (\u201cWithout jurisdiction the court cannot\nproceed at all in any cause. Jurisdiction is power to de\u00ad\nclare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only func\u00ad\ntion remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact\nand dismissing the cause\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).     Although the line between subject-matter\njurisdiction over a claim and the merits of that claim can\nat times prove difficult to draw, see Arbaugh v. Y & H\nCorp., 546 U. S. 500, 513\u2013515 (2006), see also Bell v. Hood,\n327 U. S. 678, 682 (1946), the distinction is crucial in the\nSupremacy Clause context. If the state court does not\nreach the merits of the dispute for lack of statutory or\nconstitutional jurisdiction, the preeminence of federal law\nremains undiminished.\n   Accordingly, the superiority of federal law as a substan\u00ad\ntive matter does not trigger an obligation on States to\nkeep their courts jurisdictionally neutral with respect to\nfederal and state-law claims. \u201cThe federal law in any field\nwithin which Congress is empowered to legislate is the\nsupreme law of the land in the sense that it may supplant\nstate legislation in that field, but not in the sense that it\nmay supplant the existing rules of litigation in state\ncourts. Congress has full power to provide its own courts\nfor litigating federal rights. The state courts belong to the\nStates.\u201d Brown v. Gerdes, 321 U. S. 178, 193 (1944)\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring).\n                             2\n   The Court was originally faithful to this conception of\nfederal supremacy. In Claflin, the Court concluded that\nbecause the federal statute under consideration did not\ndeprive the state court of jurisdiction, the state court was\ncompetent to resolve the claim. See 93 U. S., at 136\u2013137\n(\u201c[R]ights, whether legal or equitable, acquired under the\nlaws of the United States, may be prosecuted in the\n16                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States courts, or in the State courts, competent to\ndecide rights of the like character and class; subject, how\u00ad\never, to this qualification, that where a right arises under\na law of the United States, Congress may, if it see[s] fit,\ngive to the Federal courts exclusive jurisdiction\u201d). But the\nCourt was careful to also explain that the Constitution did\nnot impose an obligation on the States to accept jurisdic\u00ad\ntion over such claims. See id., at 137 (explaining that\nthere \u201cis no reason why the State courts should not be\nopen for the prosecution of rights growing out of the laws\nof the United States, to which their jurisdiction is compe\u00ad\ntent, and not denied\u201d). The Constitution instead left the\nStates with the choice\u2014but not the obligation\u2014to enter\u00ad\ntain federal actions. See id., at 139 (\u201c[W]here no direction\nis given [from Congress] on the subject, it was assumed, in\nour early judicial history, that the State courts retained\ntheir usual jurisdiction concurrently with the Federal\nCourts invested with jurisdiction in like cases\u201d).\n   Then in Second Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1\n(1912), the Court applied the rule set forth in Claflin and\ncorrectly rejected a Connecticut court\u2019s refusal to enforce\nthe 1908 Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), 45\nU. S. C. \u00a751 et seq. FELA neither provided for exclusive\nfederal jurisdiction nor attempted to require state courts\nto entertain claims brought under it. See 223 U. S., at 54\u2013\n55. Therefore, the statute was enforceable \u201cas of right, in\nthe courts of the States when their jurisdiction, as pre\nscribed by local laws, is adequate to the occasion.\u201d Id., at\n55 (emphasis added). Connecticut had not deprived its\ncourts of subject-matter jurisdiction over FELA claims;\nthus, the state court\u2019s refusal to hear the claim was \u201cnot\nbecause the ordinary jurisdiction of the Superior Courts,\nas defined by the constitution and laws of the State, was\ndeemed inadequate or not adapted to the adjudication of\nsuch a case.\u201d Ibid. Rather, the state court took the posi\u00ad\ntion that \u201cit would be inconvenient and confusing for the\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            17\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsame court, in dealing with cases of the same general\nclass, to apply in some the standards of right established\nby the congressional act and in others the different stan\u00ad\ndards recognized by the laws of the State.\u201d Id., at 55\u201356.\n   The Court\u2019s reversal of such a decision is compatible\nwith the original understanding of Article III and the\nSupremacy Clause. Because there was no question that\nthe state court had subject-matter jurisdiction under state\nlaw to adjudicate the federal claim, id., at 57, the Court\ncorrectly observed that the state court\u2019s refusal to decide\nthe case amounted to a policy dispute with federal law:\n\u201cWhen Congress, in the exertion of the power confided to it\nby the Constitution, adopted that [federal] act, it spoke for\nall the people and all the States, and thereby established a\npolicy for all. That policy is as much the policy of Con\u00ad\nnecticut as if the act had emanated from its own legisla\u00ad\nture, and should be respected accordingly in the courts of\nthe State.\u201d Ibid. It was for this specific reason, then, that\nthe Court rejected Connecticut\u2019s refusal to adjudicate the\nfederal claim. As the Court correctly noted, the \u201cexistence\nof the jurisdiction creates an implication of duty to exer\u00ad\ncise it, and that its exercise may be onerous does not\nmilitate against that implication.\u201d Id., at 58.\n   But nothing in Second Employers\u2019 suggested that the\nSupremacy Clause could pre-empt a state law that de\u00ad\nprived the local court of subject-matter jurisdiction over\nthe federal claim. Instead, the Second Employers\u2019 Court\ntook exactly the opposite position on this question: \u201c[W]e\ndeem it well to observe that there is not here involved any\nattempt by Congress to enlarge or regulate the jurisdiction\nof state courts . . . but only a question of the duty of such a\ncourt, when its ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by local\nlaws is appropriate to the occasion.\u201d Id., at 56\u201357.\n   The Court again confronted this issue in Douglas v. New\nYork, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279 U. S. 377 (1929). There, the\nCourt considered whether a New York court was required\n18                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nto hear a claim brought under FELA. Unlike the Con\u00ad\nnecticut court in Second Employers\u2019, however, the New\nYork court did not have jurisdiction under state law to\nentertain the federal cause of action. 279 U. S., at 386\u2013\n387. As a result, this Court upheld the state-court ruling\nthat dismissed the claim. The Court explained that FELA\ndid \u201cnot purport to require State Courts to entertain suits\narising under it, but only to empower them to do so, so far\nas the authority of the United States is concerned. It may\nvery well be that if the Supreme Court of New York [was]\ngiven no discretion, being otherwise competent, it would\nbe subject to a duty. But there is nothing in the Act of\nCongress that purports to force a duty upon such Courts\nas against an otherwise valid excuse.\u201d Id., at 387\u2013388. In\nother words, because the New York court lacked subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction under state law, it was not \u201cotherwise\ncompetent\u201d to adjudicate the federal claim.\n  In sum, Claflin, Second Employers\u2019, and Douglas to\u00ad\ngether establish that a state court\u2019s inability to entertain a\nfederal claim because of a lack of state-law jurisdiction is\nan \u201cotherwise valid excuse\u201d that in no way denies the\nsuperiority of federal substantive law. It simply disables\nthe state court from adjudicating a claim brought under\nthat federal law.\n                               3\n  It was not until five years after Douglas that the Court\nused the Supremacy Clause to strike down a state juris\u00ad\ndictional statute for its failure to permit state-court adju\u00ad\ndication of federal claims. See McKnett, 292 U. S. 230.\nThe Court started by correctly noting that it \u201cwas settled\u201d\nin Second Employers\u2019 \u201cthat a state court whose ordinary\njurisdiction as prescribed by local laws is appropriate to\nthe occasion, may not refuse to entertain suits under\n[FELA].\u201d 292 U. S., at 233. Yet, even though the Alabama\ncourt lacked such jurisdiction over the relevant federal\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nclaim pursuant to a state statute, the McKnett Court held\nthat the state court had improperly dismissed the federal\nclaim. Id., at 231\u2013234.\n   According to the Court, \u201c[w]hile Congress has not at\u00ad\ntempted to compel states to provide courts for the en\u00ad\nforcement of [FELA], the Federal Constitution prohibits\nstate courts of general jurisdiction from refusing to do so\nsolely because the suit is brought under a federal law.\nThe denial of jurisdiction by the Alabama court is based\nsolely upon the source of law sought to be enforced. The\nplaintiff is cast out because he is suing to enforce a federal\nact. A state may not discriminate against rights arising\nunder federal laws.\u201d Id., at 233\u2013234.\n   For all the reasons identified above, McKnett cannot be\nreconciled with the decisions of this Court that preceded\nit. Unlike the Connecticut court in Second Employers\u2019, the\nAlabama Supreme Court did not indulge its own bias\nagainst adjudication of federal claims in state court by\nrefusing to hear a federal claim over which it had subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction. Rather, like the New York court\ndecision affirmed in Douglas, the Alabama court\u2019s dis\u00ad\nmissal merely respected a jurisdictional barrier to adjudi\u00ad\ncation of the federal claim imposed by state law. The fact\nthat Alabama courts were competent to hear similar state\u00ad\nlaw claims should have been immaterial. Alabama had\nexercised its sovereign right to establish the subject\u00ad\nmatter jurisdiction of its courts. Under Claflin and its\nprogeny, that legislative judgment should have been up\u00ad\nheld.\n   Despite McKnett\u2019s infidelity to the Constitution and\nmore than a century of Supreme Court jurisprudence, the\nCourt\u2019s later decisions have repeated McKnett\u2019s declara\u00ad\ntion that state jurisdictional statutes must be policed for\nantifederal discrimination. See, e.g., Testa v. Katt, 330\nU. S. 386, 394 (1947) (\u201cIt is conceded that this same type\nof claim arising under Rhode Island law would be enforced\n20                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nby that State\u2019s courts. . . . Under these circumstances the\nState courts are not free to refuse enforcement of petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 claim\u201d); Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 375 (1990)\n(\u201c[W]hether the question is framed in pre-emption terms,\nas petitioner would have it, or in the obligation to assume\njurisdiction over a \u2018federal\u2019 cause of action, . . . the Florida\ncourt\u2019s refusal to entertain one discrete category of \u00a71983\nclaims, when the court entertains similar state-law actions\nagainst state defendants, violates the Supremacy Clause\u201d).\nThe outcome in these cases, however, can be reconciled\nwith first principles notwithstanding the Court\u2019s stated\nreliance on McKnett\u2019s flawed interpretation of the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause.6\n   In Testa, the Court struck down the Rhode Island Su\u00ad\npreme Court\u2019s refusal to entertain a claim under the fed\u00ad\neral Emergency Price Control Act. There was no dispute\nthat \u201cthe Rhode Island courts [had] jurisdiction adequate\nand appropriate under established local law to adjudicate\nthis action.\u201d 330 U. S., at 394, and n. 13. The Rhode\nIsland court nevertheless declined to exercise that juris\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Other decisions also have articulated this antidiscrimination princi\u00ad\nple. See, e.g., Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U. S. 911 (1997); Missouri ex rel.\nSouthern R. Co. v. Mayfield, 340 U. S. 1 (1950); Herb v. Pitcairn, 324\nU. S. 117 (1945); Miles v. Illinois Central R. Co., 315 U. S. 698 (1942).\nThe outcomes in these cases nonetheless preserved state-court jurisdic\u00ad\ntional autonomy. In Johnson and Herb, the Court sustained the state\u00ad\ncourt dismissals of the federal claims as nondiscriminatory. See\nJohnson, supra, at 918\u2013920; Herb, supra, at 123. In Mayfield, the\nCourt never decided whether the state court had jurisdiction over the\nrelevant federal claim; rather, it remanded the case to the Missouri\nSupreme Court based on the state court\u2019s possibly erroneous interpre\u00ad\ntation of federal law at issue in that case. See 340 U. S., at 4\u20135.\nFinally, in Miles, the Court struck down a Tennessee decision that\nenjoined a citizen of that State from pursuing a FELA action in Mis\u00ad\nsouri state court \u201con grounds of inequity.\u201d 315 U. S., at 702. The Court\ncorrectly held that, so long as jurisdiction existed under Missouri law,\nthe Tennessee court could not rely on its own notions of \u201cinequity\u201d to\nthwart the vindication of a federal right in state court.

I.\n256, 258, 43 A. 2d 467, 468 (1945), which had relied on a\n\u201cuniversally acknowledged\u201d doctrine \u201cof private interna\u00ad\ntional law\u201d as a basis for refusing to adjudicate federal\n\u201cpenal\u201d claims. Because the Rhode Island Supreme Court\nhad invoked this common-law doctrine despite the exis\u00ad\ntence of state-law statutory jurisdiction over the federal\nclaims, this Court correctly ruled that the state court\u2019s\n\u201cpolicy against enforcement . . . of statutes of other states\nand the United States which it deems penal, [could not] be\naccepted as a \u2018valid excuse.\u2019 \u201d 330 U. S., at 392\u2013393.\n   Testa thus represents a routine application of the rule of\nlaw set forth in Second Employers\u2019: As long as jurisdiction\nover a federal claim exists as a matter of state law, state\u00ad\ncourt judges cannot sua sponte refuse to enforce federal\nlaw because they disagree with Congress\u2019 decision to allow\nfor adjudication of certain federal claims in state court.\nSee 330 U.

As quoted\nabove, the Court (in dicta) accurately summarized the holding of\nSecond Employers\u2019. See 241 U. S., at 222. The Court also reiterated\nthat before a state court owes a duty to enforce federal law, it must\nhave subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim under state law. See\nid., at 221 (\u201c[L]awful rights of the citizen, whether arising from a\nlegitimate exercise of state or national power . . . are concurrently\nsubject to be enforced in the courts of the State or nation when such\nrights come within the general scope of the jurisdiction conferred upon\nsuch courts by the authority, State or nation, creating them\u201d); id., at\n22                      HAYWOOD v.

S., at 361, 375\u2013381. The Florida court had\ninterpreted the State\u2019s statutory \u201cwaiver of sovereign\nimmunity\u201d not to extend to federal claims brought in state\ncourt. Id., at 361 (citing Fla. Stat. \u00a7768.28 (1989)). Ac\u00ad\ncording to the state court, absent a statutory waiver,\nFlorida\u2019s pre-existing common-law sovereign immunity\nrule provided a \u201cblanket immunity on [state] governmen\u00ad\ntal entities from federal civil rights actions under \u00a71983\u201d\nbrought in Florida courts. 496 U.

Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a72373, p. 396, n. 4 (1981))). Sec\u00ad\nond, Florida\u2019s sovereign immunity rule violated the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause by operating as a state-law defense to a\nfederal law. See Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277,\n284, n. 8 (1980) (\u201c \u2018[P]ermitt[ing] a state immunity defense\nto have controlling effect\u2019 \u201d over a federal claim violates the\nSupremacy Clause). Resolving a federal claim with pre\u00ad\nclusive effect based on a state-law defense is far different\nfrom simply closing the door of the state courthouse to\nthat federal claim. The first changes federal law by deny\u00ad\ning relief on the merits; the second merely dictates the\nforum in which the federal claim will be heard.\n  In the end, of course, \u201cthe ultimate touchstone of consti\u00ad\ntutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have\nsaid about it.\u201d Graves v. New York ex rel. O\u2019Keefe, 306\nU. S. 466, 491\u2013492 (1939) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\nAnd contrary to McKnett, the Constitution does not re\u00ad\nquire state courts to give equal billing to state and federal\nclaims. To read the Supremacy Clause to include an anti\u00ad\ndiscrimination principle undermines the compromise that\nshaped Article III and contradicts the original understand\u00ad\ning of Constitution. There is no justification for preserv\u00ad\ning such a principle. But even if the Court chooses to\nadhere to the antidiscrimination rule as part of the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause inquiry, the rule\u2019s infidelity to the text,\nstructure, and history of the Constitution counsels against\nextending the principle any further than our precedent\nrequires. Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 584\u2013\n585 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring); see infra, at 27\u201333.\n24                      HAYWOOD v.

Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 62\u201363 (2002); United\nStates v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89, 109 (2000), or when the state\nlaw conflicts with a federal statute, see American Tele\nphone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc.,\n524 U. S. 214 (1998); Florida Lime & Avocado Growers,\nInc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132 (1963). NYCLA \u00a724 does not\nfall prey to either category of pre-emption.8\n  First, federal law does not expressly require New York\ncourts to accept jurisdiction over \u00a71983 suits. Under\n\u00a71983, any state official who denies \u201cany citizen of the\nUnited States or other person within the jurisdiction\nthereof . . . any rights, privileges, or immunities secured\nby the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party\ninjured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper\nproceeding for redress.\u201d The statute addresses who may\nsue and be sued for violations of federal law. But it in\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Because 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 does not pre-empt NYCLA \u00a724, there is\n\nno need to reach the more difficult question of whether Congress has\nthe delegated authority under the Constitution to require state courts\nto entertain a federal cause of action. Compare Printz v. United States,\n521 U.

See\nFelder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 158 (1988) (O\u2019Connor, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cSection 1983 . . . creates no substantive\nlaw. . . . Its purpose, as we have repeatedly said, \u2018was to\ninterpose the federal courts between the States and the\npeople, as guardians of the people\u2019s federal rights\u2019 \u201d (quot\u00ad\ning Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S. 496, 503\n(1982))). Like FELA, therefore, \u00a71983 does not \u201cenlarge or\nregulate the jurisdiction of state courts.\u201d Second Employ\ners\u2019, 223 U. S., at 56.9\n   Second, NYCLA \u00a724 does not conflict with \u00a71983. See\nWyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 9)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (explaining that the\nCourt has alternatively described the standard for conflict\npre-emption as \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d and \u201cdirect con\u00ad\nflict\u201d (citations omitted)). As explained above, Congress\ndid not grant \u00a71983 plaintiffs a \u201cright\u201d to bring their\nclaims in state court or \u201cguarantee\u201d that the state forum\nwould remain open to their suits. See id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12). Moreover, Congress has created inferior federal\ncourts that have the power to adjudicate all \u00a71983 actions.\nAnd this Court has expressly determined that \u00a71983\nplaintiffs do not have to exhaust state-court remedies\nbefore proceeding in federal court. See Patsy, supra, at\n516.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The history surrounding \u00a71983\u2019s enactment also supports this con\u00ad\nclusion. See Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 158 (1988),(O\u2019Connor, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201c[T]he original version of \u00a71983 provided that the federal\ncourts would have exclusive jurisdiction of actions arising under it.\nThis fact is conclusive proof that the Congress which enacted \u00a71983\nover 100 years ago, could not possibly have meant thereby to alter the\noperation of state courts in any way . . . . Abandoning the rule of\nexclusive federal jurisdiction over \u00a71983 actions, and thus restoring the\ntradition of concurrent jurisdiction . . . did not leave behind a pre\u00ad\nemptive grin without a statutory cat\u201d (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted)).\n26                  HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   Therefore, even if every state court closed its doors to\n\u00a71983 plaintiffs, the plaintiffs could proceed with their\nclaims in the federal forum. See, e.g., Felder, supra, at 160\n(O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\u201cEvery plaintiff has the option\nof proceeding in federal court, and the Wisconsin statute\nhas not the slightest effect on that right\u201d). And because\nthe dismissal of \u00a71983 claims from state court pursuant to\nNYCLA \u00a724 is for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, see\nsupra, at 8\u20139, it has no preclusive effect on claims refiled\nin federal court, see Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 94,\n105 (1980) (requiring \u201ca final judgment on the merits\u201d\nbefore a \u00a71983 would be barred in federal court under\nthe doctrine of claim preclusion), and thus does not alter\nthe substance of the federal claim.           Any contention\nthat NYCLA \u00a724 conflicts with \u00a71983 therefore would be\nmisplaced.\n   The Court nevertheless has relied on an expansive\nbrand of \u201cconflict\u201d pre-emption to strike down state-court\nprocedural rules that are perceived to \u201cburde[n] the exer\u00ad\ncise of the federal right\u201d in state court. Felder, 487 U. S.,\nat 141. In such cases, the Court has asked if the state-law\nrule, when applied \u201cto \u00a71983 actions brought in state\ncourts [is] consistent with the goals of the federal civil\nrights laws, or does the enforcement of such a requirement\ninstead \u2018stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and\nexecution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u2019?\u201d\nSee id., at 138 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,\n67 (1941)). There has been no suggestion in this case,\nhowever, that NYCLA \u00a724 is a procedural rule that must\nbe satisfied in order to bring the \u00a71983 action in state\ncourt. See supra, at 8\u20139; infra, at 27; see also ante, at 13,\nn. 9. As explained above, petitioner\u2019s claim was not proce\u00ad\ndurally deficient; the state court simply lacked the power\nto adjudicate the claim. See supra, at 8\u20139.

The majority con\u00ad\ncedes not only that NYCLA \u00a724 is jurisdictional, but that\nthe statute is neutral with respect to federal and state\nclaims. Nevertheless, it concludes that the statute vio\u00ad\nlates the Supremacy Clause because it finds that \u201cequality\nof treatment does not ensure that a state law will be\ndeemed a neutral rule of judicial administration and\ntherefore a valid excuse for refusing to entertain a federal\ncause of action.\u201d Ante, at 8\u20139.

DROWN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhen it asserts that jurisdictional neutrality is \u201cthe be\u00ad\nginning, not the end, of the Supremacy Clause analysis.\u201d\nAnte, at 9\u201310. As explained above, see supra, at 10\u201323,\n\u201csubject to only one limitation, each State of the Union\nmay establish its own judicature, distribute judicial power\namong the courts of its choice, [and] define the conditions\nfor the exercise of their jurisdiction and the modes of their\nproceeding, to the same extent as Congress is empowered\nto establish a system of inferior federal courts within the\nlimits of federal judicial power.\u201d Brown, 321 U. S., at 188\n(Frankfurter, J., concurring). That \u201cone limitation\u201d is the\nneutrality principle that the Court has found in the Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause. See id., at 189 (\u201cThe only limitation\nupon the freedom of a State to define the jurisdiction of its\nown courts is that . . . [it] must treat litigants under the\nFederal act as other litigants are treated\u201d (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted)); Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 123\n(1945) (\u201cThe freedom of the state courts so to decide is, of\ncourse, subject to the qualification that the cause of action\nmust not be discriminated against because it is a federal\none\u201d). Here, it is conceded that New York has deprived its\ncourts of subject-matter jurisdiction over a particular class\nof claims on terms that treat federal and state actions\nequally. See ante, at 1\u20132, 8\u201310. That is all this Court\u2019s\nprecedent requires. See supra, at 9, 18\u201319.\n   The majority\u2019s assertion that jurisdictional neutrality is\nnot the touchstone because \u201c[a] jurisdictional rule cannot\nbe used as a device to undermine federal law, no matter\nhow even-handed it may appear,\u201d ante, at 9, reflects a\nmisunderstanding of the law. A jurisdictional statute\nsimply deprives the relevant court of the power to decide\nthe case altogether. See 10A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72713, p. 239 (3d\ned. 1998) (\u201cIf the court has no jurisdiction, it has no power\nto enter a judgment on the merits and must dismiss the\naction\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a711, p. 108\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

Such a statute necessarily operates without\nprejudice to the adjudication of the matter in a competent\nforum. See supra, at 14\u201315. Jurisdictional statutes there\u00ad\nfore by definition are incapable of undermining federal\nlaw. NYCLA \u00a724 no more undermines \u00a71983 than the\namount-in-controversy requirement for federal diversity\njurisdiction undermines state law. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332.\nThe relevant law (state or federal) remains fully operative\nin both circumstances. The sole consequence of the juris\u00ad\ndictional barrier is that the law cannot be enforced in one\nparticular judicial forum.10\n  As a result, the majority\u2019s focus on New York\u2019s reasons\nfor enacting this jurisdictional statute is entirely mis\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 If by asserting that state law is not permitted to \u201cundermine fed\u00ad\neral law,\u201d ante, at 9, the majority instead is arguing that NYCLA \u00a724 is\na procedural rule that too heavily \u201cburdens the exercise of the federal\nright\u201d in state court, see Felder, 487 U. S., at 141, its argument is\nequally misplaced. First, the majority concedes that NYCLA \u00a724 is not\na state procedural rule. See ante, at 12, n. 8. Second, applying the\nreasoning of Felder to a jurisdictional statute like NYCLA \u00a724 would\noverrule all of the Court\u2019s decisions upholding state laws that decline\njurisdiction over federal claims, and would virtually ensure that in\nfuture cases, no state jurisdictional rule will be upheld as constitu\u00ad\ntional. By simply rendering a federal claim noncognizable in state\ncourt, a statute depriving a state court of subject-matter jurisdiction\n(even under the terms and conditions permitted by this Court\u2019s prece\u00ad\ndent) will always violate Felder\u2019s command that a state rule must not\nundermine the \u201cremedial objectives\u201d of a federal claim, see 487 U. S., at\n138. The jurisdictional statute also will unavoidably implicate Felder\u2019s\nconcern that a state rule should not inevitably produce a different\noutcome depending on whether a claim is asserted in state or federal\ncourt, see ibid. A state jurisdictional statute necessarily will result in a\ndifferent outcome in state court, where it will cause dismissal of the\nfederal claim, than in federal court, where that claim will be heard. It\nis for this reason that the Court has been careful to keep its examina\u00ad\ntion of state jurisdictional statutes and state procedural rules in differ\u00ad\nent categories.\n30                  HAYWOOD v.

United States, 521 U. S. 898, 928 (1997). New\nYork has the organic authority, therefore, to tailor the\njurisdiction of state courts to meet its policy goals. See\nFay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 466\u2013467 (1963) (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cThe right of the State to regulate its own\nprocedures governing the conduct of litigants in its courts,\nand its interest in supervision of those procedures, stand\non the same constitutional plane as its right and interest\nin framing \u2018substantive\u2019 laws governing other aspects of\nthe conduct of those within its borders\u201d).\n   It may be true that it was \u201cCongress\u2019 judgment that all\npersons who violate federal rights while acting under color\nof state law shall be held liable for damages.\u201d Ante, at 7\u2013\n8.

Our decisions have held only\nthat the States cannot use jurisdictional statutes to dis\u00ad\ncriminate against federal claims. Because NYCLA \u00a724\ndoes not violate this command, any policy-driven reasons\nfor depriving jurisdiction over a \u201cfederal claim in addition\nto an identical state claim,\u201d ante, at 8, are irrelevant for\npurposes of the Supremacy Clause.\n   This Court\u2019s decision in Howlett is not to the contrary.\nDespite the majority\u2019s assertion, Howlett does not stand\nfor the proposition \u201cthat a State cannot employ a jurisdic\u00ad\ntional rule \u2018to dissociate itself from federal law because of\ndisagreement with its content or a refusal to recognize the\nsuperior authority of its source.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6 (quoting\nHowlett, 496 U.

Howlett\u2019s reiteration of McKnett\u2019s neutrality\ncommand, which is all the selected quotation reflects, see\n496 U. S., at 372\u2013373, offers no refuge to the majority in\nlight of its concession that NYCLA \u00a724 affords \u201cequal\ntreatment\u201d to \u201cfederal and state claims.\u201d Ante, at 8.\n   Howlett instead stands for the unremarkable proposi\u00ad\ntion that States may not add immunity defenses to \u00a71983.\nSee ante, at 7, n. 5 (explaining that Howlett held that \u201ca\nFlorida school board could [not] assert a state-law immu\u00ad\nnity defense in a \u00a71983 action brought in state court\u201d\nbecause \u201cthe \u2018elements of, and the defenses to, a federal\ncause of action are defined by federal law\u2019 \u201d (quoting 496\nU. S., at 375)). A state law is not jurisdictional just be\u00ad\ncause the legislature has \u201cdenominated\u201d it as such. Id., at\n381. As the majority observes, the State\u2019s \u201cinvocation of\n\u2018jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d cannot \u201ctrump\u201d the \u201cSupremacy Clause\ninquiry,\u201d ante, at 11\u201312.

Rather, a state statute must in fact operate\njurisdictionally: It must deprive the court of the power to\nhear the claim and it must not preclude relitigation of the\naction in a proper forum. See supra, at 28\u201329. Howlett\nproved the point by striking down a state-law immunity\nrule that bore the jurisdictional label but operated as a\ndefense on the merits and provided for the dismissal of the\nstate court action with prejudice. See 496 U. S., at 359;\nsupra, at 22\u201323.\n   But the majority\u2019s axiomatic refrain about jurisdictional\nlabels is entirely unresponsive to the issue before the\nCourt\u2014i.e., whether NYCLA \u00a724 operates jurisdictionally.\nUnlike the Florida immunity rule in Howlett, NYCLA \u00a724\n32                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis not a defense to a federal claim and the dismissal it\nauthorizes is without prejudice. See 9 N. Y. 3d 481, 490,\n881 N. E. 2d 180, 186 (2007) (explaining that \u201cthe Legisla\u00ad\nture did nothing more than exercise its prerogative to\nestablish the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts\u201d\nand that \u201clitigants like plaintiff can use the federal courts\nto pursue section 1983 claims\u201d against correction officers).\nFor this reason, NYCLA \u00a724 is not merely \u201cdenominated\u201d\nas jurisdictional\u2014it actually is jurisdictional. The New\nYork courts, therefore, have not declared a \u201ccategory\u201d of\n\u00a71983 claims to be \u201c \u2018frivolous\u2019 \u201d or to have \u201c \u2018no merit\u2019 \u201d in\norder to \u201c \u2018relieve congestion\u2019 \u201d in the state-court system.\nSee ante, at 7\u20138 (quoting Howlett, supra, at 380). These\ncourts have simply recognized that they lack the power to\nadjudicate this category of claims regardless of their\nmerit.\n   The majority\u2019s failure to grapple with the clear differ\u00ad\nences between the immunity rule at issue in Howlett and\nNYCLA \u00a724 proves that its decision is untethered from\nprecedent. And more broadly, the majority\u2019s failure to\naccount for the important role of claim preclusion in\nevaluating whether a statute is jurisdictional undermines\nthe important line drawn by this Court\u2019s decisions be\u00ad\ntween subject-matter jurisdiction and the merits. See\nMarrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,\n470 U. S. 373, 382 (1985) (\u201cWith respect to matters that\nwere not decided in the state proceedings . . . claim preclu\u00ad\nsion generally does not apply where \u2018the plaintiff was\nunable to . . . seek a remedy because of the limitations on\nthe subject matter jurisdiction of the courts\u2019 \u201d (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a726(1)(c)(1982))); see\nalso Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 514\u2013516; Steel Co., 523 U. S.,\nat 94.\n   The majority\u2019s principal response is that NYCLA \u00a724 \u201cis\neffectively an immunity statute cloaked in jurisdictional\ngarb.\u201d Ante, at 12. But this curious rejoinder resurrects an\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    33\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nargument that the majority abandons earlier in its own\nopinion. See ante, at 7, n. 5. The majority needs to choose.\nEither it should definitively commit to making the impos\u00ad\nsible case that a statute denying state courts the power to\nentertain a claim without prejudice to its reassertion in\nfederal court is an immunity defense in disguise, or it\nshould clearly explain why some other aspect of Howlett\ncontrols the outcome of this case. This Court has required\nCongress to speak clearly when it intends to \u201cupset the\nusual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.\u201d\nGregory, 501 U. S., at 460. It should require no less of\nitself.\n   At bottom, the majority\u2019s warning that upholding New\nYork\u2019s law \u201cwould permit a State to withhold a forum for\nthe adjudication of any federal cause of action with which\nit disagreed as long as the policy took the form of a juris\u00ad\ndictional rule\u201d is without any basis in fact. Ante, at 13,\nn. 9. This Court\u2019s jurisdictional neutrality command al\u00ad\nready guards against antifederal discrimination. A deci\u00ad\nsion upholding NYCLA \u00a724, which fully adheres to that\nrule, would not \u201ccircumvent our prior decisions.\u201d Ibid. It\nsimply would adhere to them.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The majority also suggests that allowing jurisdictional neutrality to\n\nbe the test \u201cwould create a blind spot in the Supremacy Clause\u201d be\u00ad\ncause a procedural rule that too heavily burdens a federal cause of\naction would be struck down as unconstitutional while \u201ca State could\nexpress its disagreement with (and even open hostility to) a federal\ncause of action, declare a desire to thwart its enforcement, and achieve\nthat goal by removing the disfavored category of claims from its courts\u2019\njurisdiction.\u201d Ante, at 12, n. 8. This is incorrect for at least two rea\u00ad\nsons. First, as explained above, a State may permissibly register its\nhostility to federal law only by subjecting analogous state-law claims to\nequally disfavored treatment. See supra, at 19\u201320. Hostility to federal\nlaw is thus irrelevant under this Court\u2019s precedent\u2014the Supremacy\nClause is concerned only with whether there is antifederal discrimina\u00ad\ntion. Second, the majority obscures important differences between\nprocedural rules, like the notice-of-claim rule at issue in Felder, and\nneutral jurisdictional statutes like NYCLA \u00a724. Unlike a neutral\n34                      HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n   The majority also incorrectly concludes that NYCLA \u00a724\nis not a neutral jurisdictional statute because it applies to\na \u201cnarrow class of defendants,\u201d ante, at 7, and because\nNew York courts \u201chear the lion\u2019s share of all other \u00a71983\nactions,\u201d ante, at 12. A statute\u2019s jurisdictional status does\nnot turn on its narrowness or on its breadth. See Ar\nbaugh, supra, at 515, n. 11. Rather, as explained above, a\nstatute\u2019s jurisdictional status turns on the grounds on\nwhich the state-law dismissal rests and the consequences\nthat follow from such rulings. No matter how narrow the\nmajority perceives NYCLA \u00a724 to be, it easily qualifies as\njurisdictional under this established standard. Accord\u00ad\ningly, it is immaterial that New York has chosen to allow\nits courts of general jurisdiction to entertain \u00a71983 actions\nagainst certain categories of defendants but not others\n(such as correction officers), or to entertain \u00a71983 actions\nagainst particular defendants for only certain types of\nrelief.\n   Building on its assumption that a statute\u2019s jurisdictional\nstatus turns on its scope, the majority further holds that\n\u201chaving made the decision to create courts of general\njurisdiction that regularly sit to entertain analogous suits,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\njurisdictional statute, which merely prevents a state court from enter\u00ad\ntaining a federal claim, failure to comply with a state procedural rule\nwill result in dismissal of a federal claim with prejudice. See Felder,\n487 U. S., at 151 (explaining that the State\u2019s \u201coutcome-determinative\nlaw must give way when a party asserts a federal right in state court\u201d).\nContrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, therefore, it is not that state\ncourts with \u201cunconstitutionally burdensome procedural rules did not go\nfar enough\u201d\u2014it is instead that they went too far by placing an insur\u00ad\nmountable procedural hurdle in the plaintiff\u2019s path that led to a judg\u00ad\nment against him on the merits. Ante, at 12, n. 8. As a result, the\nCourt\u2019s assessment of whether a state procedural rule too heavily\nburdens a federal right does not have any bearing on the Court\u2019s\ncontinued adherence to the neutrality principle as the sole determinant\nin evaluating state-law jurisdictional statutes.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           35\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nNew York is not at liberty to shut the courthouse door to\nfederal claims that it considers at odds with its local pol\u00ad\nicy.\u201d Ante, at 11. But whether two claims are \u201canalogous\u201d\nis relevant only for purposes of determining whether a\nstate jurisdictional statute discriminates against federal\nlaw. This inquiry necessarily requires an evaluation of\nthe similarities between federal and state law claims to\nassess whether state-court jurisdiction is being denied to a\nfederal claim simply because of its federal character.\n   In contrast, the majority limits its analysis to state-law\nclaims, finding discrimination based solely on the fact that\nstate law provides jurisdiction in state court for claims\nagainst state officials who serve in \u201canalogous\u201d roles to the\ncorrection officers. See ante, at 10. The majority\u2019s inquiry\nis not probative of antifederal discrimination, which is the\nconcern that first led this Court in McKnett to find a Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause limitation on state-court jurisdictional\nautonomy. Consequently, there is no support for the\nmajority\u2019s assertion that New York\u2019s decision to treat\npolice officers differently from correction officers for pur\u00ad\nposes of civil litigation somehow violates the Constitution.\nSee ante, at 10.\n   Worse still, the majority concludes that \u00a71983 claims for\ndamages against \u201cother state officials\u201d are \u201csufficiently\nanalogous to petitioner\u2019s \u00a71983 claims\u201d to trigger a Su\u00ad\npremacy Clause violation. Ante, at 10\u201311, and n. 6. Un\u00ad\nder this reasoning, if a State grants its trial courts juris\u00ad\ndiction to hear \u00a71983 claims for damages against any state\nofficial, the State\u2019s decision to deny those courts the power\nto entertain some narrower species of \u00a71983 claims\u2014even\non jurisdictionally neutral terms\u2014a fortiori violates the\nSupremacy Clause. The majority\u2019s assurance that its\nholding is applicable only to New York\u2019s \u201cunique scheme\u201d\nthus rings hollow. Ante, at 12. The majority is forcing\nStates into an all-or-nothing choice that neither the Con\u00ad\nstitution nor this Court\u2019s decisions require. See FERC v.\n36                   HAYWOOD v. DROWN\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nMississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 774, n. 4 (1982) (Powell, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cIt would not be\nopen to us to insist on adjudication in a state court of a\nfederal claim arising beyond the jurisdiction of the local\ncourt\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Indeed, the majority\u2019s novel approach breaks the prom\u00ad\nise that the States still enjoy \u201c \u2018great latitude . . . to estab\u00ad\nlish the structure and jurisdiction of their own courts.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 10 (quoting Howlett, 496 U. S., at 372). It cannot\nbe that New York has forsaken the right to withdraw a\nparticular class of claims from its courts\u2019 purview simply\nbecause it has created courts of general jurisdiction that\nwould otherwise have the power to hear suits for damages\nagainst correction officers. The Supremacy Clause does\nnot fossilize the jurisdiction of state courts in their original\nform. Under this Court\u2019s precedent, States remain free to\nalter the structure of their judicial system even if that\nmeans certain federal causes of action will no longer be\nheard in state court, so long as States do so on nondis\u00ad\ncriminatory terms. See Printz, 521 U. S., at 906, n. 1.\n(explaining that \u201cthe States obviously regulate the \u2018ordi\u00ad\nnary jurisdiction\u2019 of their courts\u201d); Johnson v. Fankell, 520\nU. S. 911, 922, n. 13 (1997) (\u201cWe have made it quite clear\nthat it is a matter for each State to decide how to structure\nits judicial system\u201d). Today\u2019s decision thus represents a\ndramatic and unwarranted expansion of this Court\u2019s\nprecedent.\n                             IV\n  \u201c[I]n order to protect the delicate balance of power man\u00ad\ndated by the Constitution, the Supremacy Clause must\noperate only in accordance with its terms.\u201d Wyeth, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment). By imposing on state courts a duty to accept\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over federal \u00a71983 actions, the\nCourt has stretched the Supremacy Clause beyond all\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           37\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nreasonable bounds and upended a compromise struck by\nthe Framers in Article III of the Constitution. Further\u00ad\nmore, by declaring unconstitutional even those laws that\ndivest state courts of jurisdiction over federal claims on a\nnon-discriminatory basis, the majority has silently over\u00ad\nturned this Court\u2019s unbroken line of decisions upholding\nstate statutes that are materially indistinguishable from\nthe New York law under review. And it has transformed a\nsingle exception to the rule of state judicial autonomy into\na virtually ironclad obligation to entertain federal busi\u00ad\nness. I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
