LOUISIANA\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA\n\n    No. 07–1529. Argued January 13, 2009—Decided May 26, 2009\nAt a preliminary hearing required by Louisiana law, petitioner Montejo\n  was charged with first-degree murder, and the court ordered the ap\n  pointment of counsel. Later that day, the police read Montejo his\n  rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and he agreed to go\n  along on a trip to locate the murder weapon. During the excursion,\n  he wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim’s widow. Upon\n  returning, he finally met his court-appointed attorney. At trial, his\n  letter was admitted over defense objection, and he was convicted and\n  sentenced to death. Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected his\n  claim that the letter should have been suppressed under the rule of\n  Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, which forbids police to initiate\n  interrogation of a criminal defendant once he has invoked his right to\n  counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding. The court reasoned\n  that Jackson’s prophylactic protection is not triggered unless the de\n  fendant has actually requested a lawyer or has otherwise asserted\n  his Sixth Amendment right to counsel; and that, since Montejo stood\n  mute at his hearing while the judge ordered the appointment of\n  counsel, he had made no such request or assertion.\nHeld:\n    1. Michigan v. Jackson should be and now is overruled. Pp. 3–18.\n       (a) The State Supreme Court’s interpretation of Jackson would\n lead to practical problems. Requiring an initial “invocation” of the\n right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson presumption, as the\n court below did, might work in States that require an indigent defen\n dant formally to request counsel before an appointment is made, but\n not in more than half the States, which appoint counsel without re\n quest from the defendant. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) On the other hand, Montejo’s solution is untenable as a theo\n retical and doctrinal matter. Eliminating the invocation requirement\n2                       MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    entirely would depart fundamentally from the rationale of Jackson,\n    whose presumption was created by analogy to a similar prophylactic\n    rule established in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, to protect the\n    Fifth Amendment-based Miranda right. Both Edwards and Jackson\n    are meant to prevent police from badgering defendants into changing\n    their minds about the right to counsel once they have invoked it, but\n    a defendant who never asked for counsel has not yet made up his\n    mind in the first instance. Pp. 6–13.\n          (c) Stare decisis does not require the Court to expand signifi\n    cantly the holding of a prior decision in order to cure its practical de\n    ficiencies. To the contrary, the fact that a decision has proved “un\n    workable” is a traditional ground for overruling it. Payne v.\n    Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. Beyond workability, the relevant fac\n    tors include the precedent’s antiquity, the reliance interests at stake,\n    and whether the decision was well reasoned. Pearson v. Callahan,\n    555 U. S. ___, ___. The first two cut in favor of jettisoning Jackson:\n    the opinion is only two decades old, and eliminating it would not up\n    set expectations, since any criminal defendant learned enough to or\n    der his affairs based on Jackson’s rule would also be perfectly capable\n    of interacting with the police on his own. As for the strength of Jack\n    son’s reasoning, when this Court creates a prophylactic rule to pro\n    tect a constitutional right, the relevant “reasoning” is the weighing of\n    the rule’s benefits against its costs. Jackson’s marginal benefits are\n    dwarfed by its substantial costs. Even without Jackson, few badger\n    ing-induced waivers, if any, would be admitted at trial because the\n    Court has taken substantial other, overlapping measures to exclude\n    them. Under Miranda, any suspect subject to custodial interrogation\n    must be advised of his right to have a lawyer present. 384 U. S., at\n    474. Under Edwards, once such a defendant “has invoked his\n    [Miranda] right,” interrogation must stop. 451 U. S., at 484. And\n    under Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, no subsequent interro\n    gation may take place until counsel is present. Id., at 153. These\n    three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient. On the other side of the\n    equation, the principal cost of applying Jackson’s rule is that crimes\n    can go unsolved and criminals unpunished when uncoerced confes\n    sions are excluded and when officers are deterred from even trying to\n    obtain confessions. The Court concludes that the Jackson rule does\n    not “pay its way,” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907–908, n. 6,\n    and thus the case should be overruled. Pp. 13–18.\n       2. Montejo should nonetheless be given an opportunity to contend\n    that his letter of apology should have been suppressed under the Ed\n    wards rule. He understandably did not pursue an Edwards objec\n    tion, because Jackson offered broader protections, but the decision\n    here changes the legal landscape.

S. 625 (1986), forbidding police to initiate\ninterrogation of a criminal defendant once he has re\nquested counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding.\n                              I\n  Petitioner Jesse Montejo was arrested on September 6,\n2002, in connection with the robbery and murder of Lewis\nFerrari, who had been found dead in his own home one\nday earlier. Suspicion quickly focused on Jerry Moore, a\ndisgruntled former employee of Ferrari’s dry cleaning\nbusiness. Police sought to question Montejo, who was a\nknown associate of Moore.\n  Montejo waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), and was interrogated at the sheriff’s\noffice by police detectives through the late afternoon and\nevening of September 6 and the early morning of Septem\nber 7. During the interrogation, Montejo repeatedly\nchanged his account of the crime, at first claiming that he\n2                     MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhad only driven Moore to the victim’s home, and ulti\nmately admitting that he had shot and killed Ferrari in\nthe course of a botched burglary. These police interroga\ntions were videotaped.\n   On September 10, Montejo was brought before a judge\nfor what is known in Louisiana as a “72-hour hearing”—a\npreliminary hearing required under state law.1 Although\nthe proceedings were not transcribed, the minute record\nindicates what transpired: “The defendant being charged\nwith First Degree Murder, Court ordered N[o] Bond set in\nthis matter. Further, Court ordered the Office of Indigent\nDefender be appointed to represent the defendant.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 63a.\n   Later that same day, two police detectives visited Mon\ntejo back at the prison and requested that he accompany\nthem on an excursion to locate the murder weapon (which\nMontejo had earlier indicated he had thrown into a lake).\nAfter some back-and-forth, the substance of which re\nmains in dispute, Montejo was again read his Miranda\nrights and agreed to go along; during the excursion, he\nwrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim’s\nwidow. Only upon their return did Montejo finally meet\nhis court-appointed attorney, who was quite upset that the\ndetectives had interrogated his client in his absence.\n   At trial, the letter of apology was admitted over defense\nobjection. The jury convicted Montejo of first-degree mur\nder, and he was sentenced to death.\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction\nand sentence. 06–1807 (1/16/08), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1793654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1793654/state-v-montejo/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008).\nAs relevant here, the court rejected Montejo’s argument\nthat under the rule of Jackson, supra, the letter should\n——————\n  1 “The sheriff or law enforcement officer having custody of an arrested\n\nperson shall bring him promptly, and in any case within seventy-two\nhours from the time of the arrest, before a judge for the purpose of\nappointment of counsel.” La.

Jackson held\nthat “if police initiate interrogation after a defendant’s\nassertion, at an arraignment or similar proceeding, of his\nright to counsel, any waiver of the defendant’s right to\ncounsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.”\n475 U. S., at 636.\n  Citing a decision of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit, Montoya v. Collins, 955 F. 2d 279\n(1992), the Louisiana Supreme Court reasoned that the\nprophylactic protection of Jackson is not triggered unless\nand until the defendant has actually requested a lawyer or\nhas otherwise asserted his Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel. 974 So. 2d, at 1260–1261, and n. 68. Because\nMontejo simply stood mute at his 72-hour hearing while\nthe judge ordered the appointment of counsel, he had\nmade no such request or assertion. So the proper inquiry,\nthe court ruled, was only whether he had knowingly,\nintelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to have\ncounsel present during the interaction with the police. Id.,\nat 1261. And because Montejo had been read his Miranda\nrights and agreed to waive them, the Court answered that\nquestion in the affirmative, 974 So. 2d, at 1262, and up\nheld the conviction.\n  We granted certiorari. 554 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                            II\n   Montejo and his amici raise a number of pragmatic\nobjections to the Louisiana Supreme Court’s interpreta\ntion of Jackson. We agree that the approach taken below\nwould lead either to an unworkable standard, or to arbi\ntrary and anomalous distinctions between defendants in\ndifferent States. Neither would be acceptable.\n   Under the rule adopted by the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt, a criminal defendant must request counsel, or\notherwise “assert” his Sixth Amendment right at the\npreliminary hearing, before the Jackson protections are\n4                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntriggered. If he does so, the police may not initiate further\ninterrogation in the absence of counsel. But if the court on\nits own appoints counsel, with the defendant taking no\naffirmative action to invoke his right to counsel, then\npolice are free to initiate further interrogations provided\nthat they first obtain an otherwise valid waiver by the\ndefendant of his right to have counsel present.\n   This rule would apply well enough in States that require\nthe indigent defendant formally to request counsel before\nany appointment is made, which usually occurs after the\ncourt has informed him that he will receive counsel if he\nasks for it. That is how the system works in Michigan, for\nexample, Mich. Ct. Rule 6.005(A) (2009), whose scheme\nproduced the factual background for this Court’s decision\nin Michigan v. Jackson. Jackson, like all other repre\nsented indigent defendants in the State, had requested\ncounsel in accordance with the applicable state law.\n   But many States follow other practices. In some two\ndozen, the appointment of counsel is automatic upon a\nfinding of indigency, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. §22–4503(c)\n(2007); and in a number of others, appointment can be\nmade either upon the defendant’s request or sua sponte by\nthe court, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 29, §4602(a) (2003).\nSee App. to Brief for National Legal Aid & Defender Assn.\net al. as Amici Curiae 1a–21a. Nothing in our Jackson\nopinion indicates whether we were then aware that not all\nStates require that a defendant affirmatively request\ncounsel before one is appointed; and of course we had no\noccasion there to decide how the rule we announced would\napply to these other States.\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court’s answer to that unre\nsolved question is troublesome. The central distinction it\ndraws—between defendants who “assert” their right to\ncounsel and those who do not—is exceedingly hazy when\napplied to States that appoint counsel absent request from\nthe defendant. How to categorize a defendant who merely\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasks, prior to appointment, whether he will be appointed\ncounsel? Or who inquires, after the fact, whether he has\nbeen? What treatment for one who thanks the court after\nthe appointment is made? And if the court asks a defen\ndant whether he would object to appointment, will a quick\nshake of his head count as an assertion of his right?\n  To the extent that the Louisiana Supreme Court’s rule\nalso permits a defendant to trigger Jackson through the\n“acceptance” of counsel, that notion is even more mysteri\nous: How does one affirmatively accept counsel appointed\nby court order? An indigent defendant has no right to\nchoose his counsel, United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\nU. S. 140, 151 (2006), so it is hard to imagine what his\n“acceptance” would look like, beyond the passive silence\nthat Montejo exhibited.\n  In practice, judicial application of the Louisiana rule in\nStates that do not require a defendant to make a request\nfor counsel could take either of two paths. Courts might\nask on a case-by-case basis whether a defendant has\nsomehow invoked his right to counsel, looking to his con\nduct at the preliminary hearing—his statements and\ngestures—and the totality of the circumstances. Or,\ncourts might simply determine as a categorical matter\nthat defendants in these States—over half of those in the\nUnion—simply have no opportunity to assert their right to\ncounsel at the hearing and are therefore out of luck.\n  Neither approach is desirable. The former would be\nparticularly impractical in light of the fact that, as amici\ndescribe, preliminary hearings are often rushed, and are\nfrequently not recorded or transcribed. Brief for National\nLegal Aid & Defender Assn. et al. 25–30. The sheer vol\nume of indigent defendants, see id., at 29, would render\nthe monitoring of each particular defendant’s reaction to\nthe appointment of counsel almost impossible. And some\ntimes the defendant is not even present. E.g., La. Code\nCrim. Proc. Ann., Art. 230.1(A) (West Supp. 2009) (allow\n6                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning court to appoint counsel if defendant is “unable to\nappear”). Police who did not attend the hearing would\nhave no way to know whether they could approach a par\nticular defendant; and for a court to adjudicate that ques\ntion ex post would be a fact-intensive and burdensome\ntask, even if monitoring were possible and transcription\navailable. Because “clarity of . . . command” and “cer\ntainty of . . . application” are crucial in rules that govern\nlaw enforcement, Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146,\n151 (1990), this would be an unfortunate way to proceed.\nSee also Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 425–426 (1986).\n   The second possible course fares no better, for it would\nachieve clarity and certainty only at the expense of intro\nducing arbitrary distinctions: Defendants in States that\nautomatically appoint counsel would have no opportunity\nto invoke their rights and trigger Jackson, while those in\nother States, effectively instructed by the court to request\ncounsel, would be lucky winners. That sort of hollow\nformalism is out of place in a doctrine that purports to\nserve as a practical safeguard for defendants’ rights.\n                             III\n  But if the Louisiana Supreme Court’s application of\nJackson is unsound as a practical matter, then Montejo’s\nsolution is untenable as a theoretical and doctrinal matter.\nUnder his approach, once a defendant is represented by\ncounsel, police may not initiate any further interrogation.\nSuch a rule would be entirely untethered from the original\nrationale of Jackson.\n                                A\n  It is worth emphasizing first what is not in dispute or at\nstake here. Under our precedents, once the adversary\njudicial process has been initiated, the Sixth Amendment\nguarantees a defendant the right to have counsel present\nat all “critical” stages of the criminal proceedings. United\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 227–228 (1967); Powell v.\nAlabama, 287 U. S. 45, 57 (1932). Interrogation by the\nState is such a stage. Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S.\n201, 204–205 (1964); see also United States v. Henry, 447\nU. S. 264, 274 (1980).\n  Our precedents also place beyond doubt that the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel may be waived by a defen\ndant, so long as relinquishment of the right is voluntary,\nknowing, and intelligent. Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S.\n285, 292, n. 4 (1988); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387,\n404 (1977); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938).\nThe defendant may waive the right whether or not he is\nalready represented by counsel; the decision to waive need\nnot itself be counseled. Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344,\n352–353 (1990). And when a defendant is read his\nMiranda rights (which include the right to have counsel\npresent during interrogation) and agrees to waive those\nrights, that typically does the trick, even though the\nMiranda rights purportedly have their source in the Fifth\nAmendment:\n    “As a general matter . . . an accused who is admon\n    ished with the warnings prescribed by this Court in\n    Miranda . . . has been sufficiently apprised of the na\n    ture of his Sixth Amendment rights, and of the conse\n    quences of abandoning those rights, so that his waiver\n    on this basis will be considered a knowing and intelli\n    gent one.” Patterson, supra, at 296.\n   The only question raised by this case, and the only one\naddressed by the Jackson rule, is whether courts must\npresume that such a waiver is invalid under certain cir\ncumstances. 475 U. S., at 630, 633. We created such a\npresumption in Jackson by analogy to a similar prophylac\ntic rule established to protect the Fifth Amendment based\nMiranda right to have counsel present at any custodial\ninterrogation. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981),\n8                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndecided that once “an accused has invoked his right to\nhave counsel present during custodial interrogation . . .\n[he] is not subject to further interrogation by the authori\nties until counsel has been made available,” unless he\ninitiates the contact. Id., at 484–485.\n   The Edwards rule is “designed to prevent police from\nbadgering a defendant into waiving his previously as\nserted Miranda rights,” Harvey, supra, at 350. It does this\nby presuming his postassertion statements to be involun\ntary, “even where the suspect executes a waiver and his\nstatements would be considered voluntary under tradi\ntional standards.” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 177\n(1991). This prophylactic rule thus “protect[s] a suspect’s\nvoluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer’s pres\nence.” Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 175 (2001) (KENNEDY,\nJ., concurring).\n   Jackson represented a “wholesale importation of the\nEdwards rule into the Sixth Amendment.” Cobb, supra, at\n175. The Jackson Court decided that a request for counsel\nat an arraignment should be treated as an invocation of\nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel “at every critical\nstage of the prosecution,” 475 U. S., at 633, despite doubt\nthat defendants “actually inten[d] their request for counsel\nto encompass representation during any further question\ning,” id., at 632–633, because doubts must be “resolved in\nfavor of protecting the constitutional claim,” id., at 633.\nCiting Edwards, the Court held that any subsequent\nwaiver would thus be “insufficient to justify police\ninitiated interrogation.” 475 U. S., at 635. In other words,\nwe presume such waivers involuntary “based on the sup\nposition that suspects who assert their right to counsel are\nunlikely to waive that right voluntarily” in subsequent\ninteractions with police. Harvey, supra, at 350.\n   The dissent presents us with a revisionist view of Jack\nson. The defendants’ request for counsel, it contends, was\nimportant only because it proved that counsel had been\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

To safeguard the right to\nassistance of counsel from what? From a knowing and\nvoluntary waiver by the defendant himself? Unless the\ndissent seeks to prevent a defendant altogether from\nwaiving his Sixth Amendment rights, i.e., to “imprison a\nman in his privileges and call it the Constitution,” Adams\nv. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 280\n(1942)—a view with zero support in reason, history or case\nlaw—the answer must be: from police pressure, i.e., badg\nering. The antibadgering rationale is the only way to\nmake sense of Jackson’s repeated citations of Edwards,\nand the only way to reconcile the opinion with our waiver\njurisprudence.2\n                            B\n  With this understanding of what Jackson stands for and\nwhence it came, it should be clear that Montejo’s interpre\ntation of that decision—that no represented defendant can\never be approached by the State and asked to consent to\ninterrogation—is off the mark. When a court appoints\ncounsel for an indigent defendant in the absence of any\nrequest on his part, there is no basis for a presumption\n——————\n   2 The dissent responds that Jackson also ensures that the defendant’s\n\ncounsel receives notice of any interrogation, post, at 6, n. 2.\nBut notice to what end? Surely not in order to protect some constitu\ntional right to receive counsel’s advice regarding waiver of the right to\nhave counsel present. Contrary to the dissent’s intimations, neither the\nadvice nor the presence of counsel is needed in order to effectuate a\nknowing waiver of the Sixth Amendment right. Our cases make clear\nthat the Miranda waivers typically suffice; indeed, even an unrepre\nsented defendant can waive his right to counsel. See supra, at 7.\n10                MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat any subsequent waiver of the right to counsel will be\ninvoluntary. There is no “initial election” to exercise the\nright, Patterson, 487 U. S., at 291, that must be preserved\nthrough a prophylactic rule against later waivers. No\nreason exists to assume that a defendant like Montejo,\nwho has done nothing at all to express his intentions with\nrespect to his Sixth Amendment rights, would not be\nperfectly amenable to speaking with the police without\nhaving counsel present. And no reason exists to prohibit\nthe police from inquiring. Edwards and Jackson are\nmeant to prevent police from badgering defendants into\nchanging their minds about their rights, but a defendant\nwho never asked for counsel has not yet made up his mind\nin the first instance.\n  The dissent’s argument to the contrary rests on a flawed\na fortiori: “If a defendant is entitled to protection from\npolice-initiated interrogation under the Sixth Amendment\nwhen he merely requests a lawyer, he is even more obvi\nously entitled to such protection when he has secured a\nlawyer.” Post, at 3. The question in Jackson, however,\nwas not whether respondents were entitled to counsel\n(they unquestionably were), but “whether respondents\nvalidly waived their right to counsel,” 475 U. S., at 630;\nand even if it is reasonable to presume from a defendant’s\nrequest for counsel that any subsequent waiver of the right\nwas coerced, no such presumption can seriously be enter\ntained when a lawyer was merely “secured” on the defen\ndant’s behalf, by the State itself, as a matter of course. Of\ncourse, reading the dissent’s analysis, one would have no\nidea that Montejo executed any waiver at all.\n  In practice, Montejo’s rule would prevent police-initiated\ninterrogation entirely once the Sixth Amendment right\nattaches, at least in those States that appoint counsel\npromptly without request from the defendant. As the\ndissent in Jackson pointed out, with no expressed dis\nagreement from the majority, the opinion “most assuredly\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[did] not hold that the Edwards per se rule prohibiting all\npolice-initiated interrogations applies from the moment\nthe defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel at\ntaches, with or without a request for counsel by the defen\ndant.” 475 U. S., at 640 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.). That\nwould have constituted a “shockingly dramatic restructur\ning of the balance this Court has traditionally struck\nbetween the rights of the defendant and those of the larger\nsociety.” Ibid.\n  Montejo’s rule appears to have its theoretical roots in\ncodes of legal ethics, not the Sixth Amendment. The\nAmerican Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional\nConduct (which nearly all States have adopted into law in\nwhole or in part) mandate that “a lawyer shall not com\nmunicate about the subject of [a] representation with a\nparty the lawyer knows to be represented by another\nlawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of\nthe other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court\norder.” Model Rule 4.2 (2008). But the Constitution does\nnot codify the ABA’s Model Rules, and does not make\ninvestigating police officers lawyers. Montejo’s proposed\nrule is both broader and narrower than the Model Rule.\nBroader, because Montejo would apply it to all agents of\nthe State, including the detectives who interrogated him,\nwhile the ethical rule governs only lawyers. And nar\nrower, because he agrees that if a defendant initiates\ncontact with the police, they may talk freely—whereas a\nlawyer could be sanctioned for interviewing a represented\nparty even if that party “initiates” the communication and\nconsents to the interview. Model Rule 4.2, Comment 3.\n  Montejo contends that our decisions support his inter\npretation of the Jackson rule. We think not. Many of the\ncases he cites concern the substantive scope of the Sixth\nAmendment—e.g., whether a particular interaction with\nthe State constitutes a “critical” stage at which counsel is\nentitled to be present—not the validity of a Sixth Amend\n12                     MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nment waiver. See Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159 (1985);\nHenry, 447 U. S. 264; Massiah, 377 U. S. 201; see also\nMoran, 475 U. S. 412. Since everyone agrees that absent a\nvalid waiver, Montejo was entitled to a lawyer during the\ninterrogation, those cases do not advance his argument.\n   Montejo also points to descriptions of the Jackson hold\ning in two later cases. In one, we noted that “analysis of\nthe waiver issue changes” once a defendant “obtains or\neven requests counsel.” Harvey, 494 U. S., at 352. But\nelsewhere in the same opinion, we explained that Jackson\napplies “after a defendant requests assistance of counsel,”\n494 U. S., at 349; “when a suspect charged with a crime\nrequests counsel outside the context of interrogation,” id.,\nat 350; and to “suspects who assert their right to counsel,”\nibid. The accuracy of the “obtains” language is thus ques\ntionable. Anyway, since Harvey held that evidence ob\ntained in violation of the Jackson rule could be admitted\nto impeach the defendant’s trial testimony, 494 U. S., at\n346, the Court’s varying descriptions of when the rule was\nviolated were dicta. The dictum from the other decision,\nPatterson, supra, at 290, n. 3, is no more probative.3\n   The upshot is that even on Jackson’s own terms, it\n\n——————\n  3 In the cited passage, the Court noted that “[o]nce an accused has a\n\nlawyer, a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving\nthe sanctity of attorney-client relationship takes effect.” Patterson, 487\nU. S., at 290, n. 3. To support that proposition, the Court cited Maine\nv. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159 (1985), which was not a case about waiver.\nThe passage went on to observe that “the analysis changes markedly\nonce an accused even requests the assistance of counsel,” 487 U. S., at\n290, n. 3 (emphasis in original), this time citing Jackson. Montejo\ninfers from the “even requests” that having counsel is more conclusive of\nthe invalidity of uncounseled waiver than the mere requesting of\ncounsel. But the Patterson footnote did not suggest that the analysis\n“changes” in both these scenarios (having a lawyer, versus requesting\none) with specific reference to the validity of waivers under the Sixth\nAmendment. The citation of Moulton (a nonwaiver case) for the first\nscenario suggests just the opposite.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould be completely unjustified to presume that a defen\ndant’s consent to police-initiated interrogation was invol\nuntary or coerced simply because he had previously been\nappointed a lawyer.\n                             IV\n   So on the one hand, requiring an initial “invocation” of\nthe right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson pre\nsumption is consistent with the theory of that decision, but\n(as Montejo and his amici argue, see Part II, supra) would\nbe unworkable in more than half the States of the Union.\nOn the other hand, eliminating the invocation require\nment would render the rule easy to apply but depart fun\ndamentally from the Jackson rationale.\n   We do not think that stare decisis requires us to expand\nsignificantly the holding of a prior decision—\nfundamentally revising its theoretical basis in the proc\ness—in order to cure its practical deficiencies. To the\ncontrary, the fact that a decision has proved “unworkable”\nis a traditional ground for overruling it. Payne v. Tennes\nsee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991). Accordingly, we called for\nsupplemental briefing addressed to the question whether\nMichigan v. Jackson should be overruled.\n   Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding\nwhether to adhere to the principle of stare decisis include\nthe antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at\nstake, and of course whether the decision was well rea\nsoned. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 8). The first two cut in favor of abandoning Jack\nson: the opinion is only two decades old, and eliminating it\nwould not upset expectations. Any criminal defendant\nlearned enough to order his affairs based on the rule\nannounced in Jackson would also be perfectly capable of\ninteracting with the police on his own. Of course it is\nlikely true that police and prosecutors have been trained\nto comply with Jackson, see generally Supplemental Brief\n14                     MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nfor Larry D. Thompson et al. as Amici Curiae, but that is\nhardly a basis for retaining it as a constitutional require\nment. If a State wishes to abstain from requesting inter\nviews with represented defendants when counsel is not\npresent, it obviously may continue to do so.4\n  Which brings us to the strength of Jackson’s reasoning.\nWhen this Court creates a prophylactic rule in order to\nprotect a constitutional right, the relevant “reasoning” is\nthe weighing of the rule’s benefits against its costs. “The\nvalue of any prophylactic rule . . . must be assessed not\nonly on the basis of what is gained, but also on the basis of\nwhat is lost.” Minnick, 498 U. S., at 161 (SCALIA, J., dis\nsenting). We think that the marginal benefits of Jackson\n(viz., the number of confessions obtained coercively that\nare suppressed by its bright-line rule and would otherwise\nhave been admitted) are dwarfed by its substantial costs\n(viz., hindering “society’s compelling interest in finding,\nconvicting, and punishing those who violate the law,”\nMoran, supra, at 426).\n  What does the Jackson rule actually achieve by way of\npreventing unconstitutional conduct? Recall that the\npurpose of the rule is to preclude the State from badgering\ndefendants into waiving their previously asserted rights.\nSee Harvey, supra, at 350; see also McNeil, 501 U. S., at\n177. The effect of this badgering might be to coerce a\nwaiver, which would render the subsequent interrogation\na violation of the Sixth Amendment. See Massiah, supra,\nat 204. Even though involuntary waivers are invalid even\n——————\n  4 The dissent posits a different reliance interest: “the public’s interest\nin knowing that counsel, once secured, may be reasonably relied upon\nas a medium between the accused and the power of the State,” post, at\n9. We suspect the public would be surprised to learn that a criminal\ncan freely sign away his right to a lawyer, confess his crimes, and then\nask the courts to assume that the confession was coerced—on the\nground that he had, at some earlier point in time, made a pro forma\nstatement requesting that counsel be appointed on his behalf.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napart from Jackson, see Patterson, 487 U. S., at 292, n. 4,\nmistakes are of course possible when courts conduct case\nby-case voluntariness review. A bright-line rule like that\nadopted in Jackson ensures that no fruits of interrogations\nmade possible by badgering-induced involuntary waivers\nare ever erroneously admitted at trial.\n   But without Jackson, how many would be? The answer\nis few if any. The principal reason is that the Court has\nalready taken substantial other, overlapping measures\ntoward the same end. Under Miranda’s prophylactic\nprotection of the right against compelled self\nincrimination, any suspect subject to custodial interroga\ntion has the right to have a lawyer present if he so re\nquests, and to be advised of that right. 384 U. S., at 474.\nUnder Edwards’ prophylactic protection of the Miranda\nright, once such a defendant “has invoked his right to have\ncounsel present,” interrogation must stop. 451 U. S., at\n484. And under Minnick’s prophylactic protection of the\nEdwards right, no subsequent interrogation may take\nplace until counsel is present, “whether or not the accused\nhas consulted with his attorney.” 498 U. S., at 153.\n   These three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient. Under\nthe Miranda-Edwards-Minnick line of cases (which is not\nin doubt), a defendant who does not want to speak to the\npolice without counsel present need only say as much\nwhen he is first approached and given the Miranda warn\nings. At that point, not only must the immediate contact\nend, but “badgering” by later requests is prohibited. If\nthat regime suffices to protect the integrity of “a suspect’s\nvoluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer’s pres\nence” before his arraignment, Cobb, 532 U. S., at 175\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring), it is hard to see why it would\nnot also suffice to protect that same choice after arraign\nment, when Sixth Amendment rights have attached. And\nif so, then Jackson is simply superfluous.\n   It is true, as Montejo points out in his supplemental\n16                MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbrief, that the doctrine established by Miranda and Ed\nwards is designed to protect Fifth Amendment, not Sixth\nAmendment, rights. But that is irrelevant. What matters\nis that these cases, like Jackson, protect the right to have\ncounsel during custodial interrogation—which right hap\npens to be guaranteed (once the adversary judicial process\nhas begun) by two sources of law. Since the right under\nboth sources is waived using the same procedure, Patter\nson, supra, at 296, doctrines ensuring voluntariness of the\nFifth Amendment waiver simultaneously ensure the\nvoluntariness of the Sixth Amendment waiver.\n   Montejo also correctly observes that the Miranda-\nEdwards regime is narrower than Jackson in one respect:\nThe former applies only in the context of custodial interro\ngation. If the defendant is not in custody then those deci\nsions do not apply; nor do they govern other, noninterroga\ntive types of interactions between the defendant and the\nState (like pretrial lineups). However, those uncovered\nsituations are the least likely to pose a risk of coerced\nwaivers. When a defendant is not in custody, he is in\ncontrol, and need only shut his door or walk away to avoid\npolice badgering. And noninterrogative interactions with\nthe State do not involve the “inherently compelling pres\nsures,” Miranda, supra, at 467, that one might reasonably\nfear could lead to involuntary waivers.\n   Jackson was policy driven, and if that policy is being\nadequately served through other means, there is no reason\nto retain its rule. Miranda and the cases that elaborate\nupon it already guarantee not simply noncoercion in the\ntraditional sense, but what Justice Harlan referred to as\n“voluntariness with a vengeance,” 384 U. S., at 505 (dis\nsenting opinion). There is no need to take Jackson’s fur\nther step of requiring voluntariness on stilts.\n   On the other side of the equation are the costs of adding\nthe bright-line Jackson rule on top of Edwards and other\nextant protections. The principal cost of applying any\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexclusionary rule “is, of course, letting guilty and possibly\ndangerous criminals go free . . . .” Herring v. United\nStates, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). Jackson\nnot only “operates to invalidate a confession given by the\nfree choice of suspects who have received proper advice of\ntheir Miranda rights but waived them nonetheless,” Cobb,\nsupra, at 174–175 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), but also\ndeters law enforcement officers from even trying to obtain\nvoluntary confessions. The “ready ability to obtain unco\nerced confessions is not an evil but an unmitigated good.”\nMcNeil, 501 U. S., at 181. Without these confessions,\ncrimes go unsolved and criminals unpunished. These are\nnot negligible costs, and in our view the Jackson Court\ngave them too short shrift.5\n   Notwithstanding this calculus, Montejo and his amici\nurge the retention of Jackson. Their principal objection to\nits elimination is that the Edwards regime which remains\nwill not provide an administrable rule. But this Court has\npraised Edwards precisely because it provides “ ‘clear and\nunequivocal’ guidelines to the law enforcement profes\nsion,” Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 682 (1988). Our\ncases make clear which sorts of statements trigger its\nprotections, see Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 459\n(1994), and once triggered, the rule operates as a bright\nline. Montejo expresses concern that courts will have to\ndetermine whether statements made at preliminary hear\nings constitute Edwards invocations—thus implicating all\nthe practical problems of the Louisiana rule we discussed\nabove, see Part II, supra. That concern is misguided. “We\n——————\n  5 The dissent claims that, in fact, few confessions have been sup\n\npressed by federal courts applying Jackson. Post, at 8. If so, that is\nbecause, as the dissent boasts, “generations of police officers have been\ntrained to refrain from approaching represented defendants,” post, at 9,\nn. 4. Anyway, if the rule truly does not hinder law enforcement or\nmake much practical difference, see post, at 7–9, and nn. 3–4, then\nthere is no reason to be particularly exercised about its demise.\n18                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhave in fact never held that a person can invoke his\nMiranda rights anticipatorily, in a context other than\n‘custodial interrogation’. . . .” McNeil, supra, at 182, n. 3.\nWhat matters for Miranda and Edwards is what happens\nwhen the defendant is approached for interrogation, and\n(if he consents) what happens during the interrogation—\nnot what happened at any preliminary hearing.\n   In sum, when the marginal benefits of the Jackson rule\nare weighed against its substantial costs to the truth\nseeking process and the criminal justice system, we read\nily conclude that the rule does not “pay its way,” United\nStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907–908, n. 6 (1984). Michi\ngan v. Jackson should be and now is overruled.\n                            V\n   Although our holding means that the Louisiana Su\npreme Court correctly rejected Montejo’s claim under\nJackson, we think that Montejo should be given an oppor\ntunity to contend that his letter of apology should still\nhave been suppressed under the rule of Edwards. If Mon\ntejo made a clear assertion of the right to counsel when\nthe officers approached him about accompanying them on\nthe excursion for the murder weapon, then no interroga\ntion should have taken place unless Montejo initiated it.\nDavis, supra, at 459. Even if Montejo subsequently agreed\nto waive his rights, that waiver would have been invalid\nhad it followed an “unequivocal election of the right,”\nCobb, 532 U. S., at 176 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Montejo understandably did not pursue an Edwards\nobjection, because Jackson served as the Sixth Amend\nment analogy to Edwards and offered broader protections.\nOur decision today, overruling Jackson, changes the legal\nlandscape and does so in part based on the protections\nalready provided by Edwards. Thus we think that a re\nmand is appropriate so that Montejo can pursue this\nalternative avenue for relief. Montejo may also seek on\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Moran, 475 U. S., at 428–\n429. These matters have heightened importance in light\nof our opinion today.\n   We do not venture to resolve these issues ourselves, not\nonly because we are a court of final review, “not of first\nview,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005),\nbut also because the relevant facts remain unclear. Mon\ntejo and the police gave inconsistent testimony about\nexactly what took place on the afternoon of September 10,\n2002, and the Louisiana Supreme Court did not make an\nexplicit credibility determination. Moreover, Montejo’s\ntestimony came not at the suppression hearing, but rather\nonly at trial, and we are unsure whether under state law\nthat testimony came too late to affect the propriety of the\nadmission of the evidence. These matters are best left for\nresolution on remand.\n   We do reject, however, the dissent’s revisionist legal\nanalysis of the “knowing and voluntary” issue. Post, at\n10–14. In determining whether a Sixth Amendment\nwaiver was knowing and voluntary, there is no reason\ncategorically to distinguish an unrepresented defendant\nfrom a represented one. It is equally true for each that, as\nwe held in Patterson, the Miranda warnings adequately\ninform him “of his right to have counsel present during the\nquestioning,” and make him “aware of the consequences of\na decision by him to waive his Sixth Amendment rights,”\n487 U. S., at 293. Somewhat surprisingly for an opinion\nthat extols the virtues of stare decisis, the dissent com\nplains that our “treatment of the waiver question rests\nentirely on the dubious decision in Patterson,” post, at 12.\nThe Court in Patterson did not consider the result dubious,\nnor does the Court today.\n20                MONTEJO v.

Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986), is indefensible.\nYet the Court does not reverse. Rather, on its own initia\ntive and without any evidence that the longstanding Sixth\nAmendment protections established in Jackson have\ncaused any harm to the workings of the criminal justice\nsystem, the Court rejects Jackson outright on the ground\nthat it is “untenable as a theoretical and doctrinal mat\nter.” Ante, at 6. That conclusion rests on a misinterpreta\ntion of Jackson’s rationale and a gross undervaluation of\nthe rule of stare decisis. The police interrogation in this\ncase clearly violated petitioner’s Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel.\n                               I\n  The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have\nthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” The right to\ncounsel attaches during “the initiation of adversary judi\ncial criminal proceedings,” Rothgery v.

LOUISIANA\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmarks omitted), and it guarantees the assistance of coun\nsel not only during in-court proceedings but during all\ncritical stages, including postarraignment interviews with\nlaw enforcement officers, see Patterson v. Illinois, 487\nU. S. 285, 290 (1988).\n   In Jackson, this Court considered whether the Sixth\nAmendment bars police from interrogating defendants\nwho have requested the appointment of counsel at ar\nraignment. Applying the presumption that such a request\nconstitutes an invocation of the right to counsel “at every\ncritical stage of the prosecution,” 475 U. S., at 633, we held\nthat “a defendant who has been formally charged with a\ncrime and who has requested appointment of counsel at\nhis arraignment” cannot be subject to uncounseled inter\nrogation unless he initiates “exchanges or conversations\nwith the police,” id., at 626.\n   In this case, petitioner Jesse Montejo contends that\npolice violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by\ninterrogating him following his “72-hour hearing” outside\nthe presence of, and without prior notice to, his lawyer.\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court rejected Montejo’s claim.\nRelying on the fact that the defendants in Jackson had\n“requested” counsel at arraignment, the state court held\nthat Jackson’s protections did not apply to Montejo be\ncause his counsel was appointed automatically; Montejo\nhad not explicitly requested counsel or affirmatively ac\ncepted the counsel appointed to represent him before he\nsubmitted to police interrogation. 06–1807, pp. 28–29\n(1/16/08), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1793654\"><a href=\"/opinion/1793654/state-v-montejo/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1261.\n   I agree with the majority’s conclusion that the Louisiana\nSupreme Court’s decision, if allowed to stand, “would lead\neither to an unworkable standard, or to arbitrary and\nanomalous distinctions between defendants in different\nStates,” ante, at 3.

Under Michigan\nlaw in effect at that time, when a defendant appeared for\narraignment the court was required to inform him that\ncounsel would be provided if he was financially needy and\nhe requested representation. Mich. Gen. Ct. Rule 785.4(1)\n(1976). It was undisputed that the Jackson defendants\nmade such a “request” at their arraignment: one by com\npleting an affidavit of indigency, and the other by respond\ning affirmatively to a question posed to him by the court.\nSee App. in Michigan v. Jackson, O. T. 1984, No. 84–1531,\np. 168; App. in Michigan v. Bladel, O. T. 1984, No. 84–\n1539, pp. 3a–4a. In neither case, however, was it clear\nthat counsel had actually been appointed at the arraign\nment. Thus, the defendants’ requests for counsel were\nsignificant as a matter of state law because they served as\nevidence that the appointment of counsel had been effec\ntuated even in the absence of proof that defense counsel\nhad actual notice of the appointments.\n   Unlike Michigan, Louisiana does not require a defen\ndant to make a request in order to receive court-appointed\ncounsel. Consequently, there is no reason to place consti\ntutional significance on the fact that Montejo neither\nvoiced a request for counsel nor affirmatively embraced\nthat appointment post hoc. Certainly our decision in\nJackson did not mandate such an odd rule. See ante, at 4\n(acknowledging that we had no occasion to decide in Jack\nson how its rule would apply in States that do not make\nappointment of counsel contingent on affirmative request).\nIf a defendant is entitled to protection from police-initiated\ninterrogation under the Sixth Amendment when he\nmerely requests a lawyer, he is even more obviously enti\ntled to such protection when he has secured a lawyer.\nIndeed, we have already recognized as much. See Michi\ngan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 352 (1990) (acknowledging\nthat “once a defendant obtains or even requests counsel,”\nJackson alters the waiver analysis); Patterson, 487 U.

In\nstead of reversing the decision of the state court by simply\nanswering the question on which we granted certiorari in\na unanimous opinion, however, the majority has decided to\nchange the law. Acting on its own initiative, the majority\noverrules Jackson to correct a “theoretical and doctrinal”\nproblem of its own imagining, see ante, at 6. A more\ncareful reading of Jackson and the Sixth Amendment\ncases upon which it relied reveals that the rule announced\nin Jackson protects a fundamental right that the Court\nnow dishonors.\n  The majority’s decision to overrule Jackson rests on its\nassumption that Jackson’s protective rule was intended to\n“prevent police from badgering defendants into changing\ntheir minds about their rights,” ante, at 10; see also ante,\n——————\n  1 In Patterson v. Illinois, we further explained, “[o]nce an accused has\n\na lawyer,” “a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserv\ning the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship takes effect.” 487\nU. S., at 290, n. 3 (citing Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176 (1985)).\n“Indeed,” we emphasized, “the analysis changes markedly once an\naccused even requests the assistance of counsel.” 487 U.

S. 477 (1981), was designed to prevent police from\ncoercing unindicted suspects into revoking their requests\nfor counsel at interrogation. Operating on that limited\nunderstanding of the purpose behind Jackson’s protective\nrule, the Court concludes that Jackson provides no safe\nguard not already secured by this Court’s Fifth Amend\nment jurisprudence. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.\n436 (1966) (requiring defendants to be admonished of their\nright to counsel prior to custodial interrogation); Edwards,\n451 U. S. 477 (prohibiting police-initiated interrogation\nfollowing defendant’s invocation of the right to counsel).\n   The majority’s analysis flagrantly misrepresents Jack\nson’s underlying rationale and the constitutional interests\nthe decision sought to protect. While it is true that the\nrule adopted in Jackson was patterned after the rule in\nEdwards, 451 U. S., at 484–485, the Jackson opinion does\nnot even mention the anti-badgering considerations that\nprovide the basis for the Court’s decision today. Instead,\nJackson relied primarily on cases discussing the broad\nprotections guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel—not its Fifth Amendment counterpart. Jackson\nemphasized that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment is\nto “ ‘protec[t] the unaided layman at critical confrontations\nwith his adversary,’ ” 475 U. S., at 631 (quoting United\nStates v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 189 (1984)), by giving\nhim “ ‘the right to rely on counsel as a ‘medium’ between\nhim[self] and the State,’ ” 475 U. S., at 632 (quoting Maine\nv. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176 (1985)). Underscoring that\nthe commencement of criminal proceedings is a decisive\nevent that transforms a suspect into an accused within the\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment, we concluded that\narraigned defendants are entitled to “at least as much\nprotection” during interrogation as the Fifth Amendment\naffords unindicted suspects. See, e.g., 475 U. S., at 632\n(“[T]he difference between the legal basis for the rule\n6                      MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\napplied in Edwards and the Sixth Amendment claim\nasserted in these cases actually provides additional sup\nport for the application of the rule in these circumstances”\n(emphasis added)). Thus, although the rules adopted in\nEdwards and Jackson are similar, Jackson did not rely on\nthe reasoning of Edwards but remained firmly rooted in\nthe unique protections afforded to the attorney-client\nrelationship by the Sixth Amendment.2\n  Once Jackson is placed in its proper Sixth Amendment\ncontext, the majority’s justifications for overruling the\ndecision crumble. Ordinarily, this Court is hesitant to\ndisturb past precedent and will do so only when a rule has\nproven “outdated, ill-founded, unworkable, or otherwise\nlegitimately vulnerable to serious reconsideration.”\nVasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 266 (1986). While stare\ndecisis is not “an inexorable command,” we adhere to it as\n“the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded,\npredictable, and consistent development of legal princi\nples, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes\nto the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial proc\n——————\n    2 Themajority insists that protection from police badgering is the\nonly purpose the Jackson rule can plausibly serve. After all, it asks,\nfrom what other evil would the rule guard? See ante, at 9. There are\ntwo obvious answers. First, most narrowly, it protects the defendant\nfrom any police-initiated interrogation without notice to his counsel, not\njust from “badgering” which is not necessarily a part of police question\ning. Second, and of prime importance, it assures that any waiver of\ncounsel will be valid. The assistance offered by counsel protects a\ndefendant from surrendering his rights with an insufficient apprecia\ntion of what those rights are and how the decision to respond to inter\nrogation might advance or compromise his exercise of those rights\nthroughout the course of criminal proceedings. A lawyer can provide\nher client with advice regarding the legal and practical options avail\nable to him; the potential consequences, both good and bad, of choosing\nto discuss his case with police; the likely effect of such a conversation on\nthe resolution of the charges against him; and an informed assessment\nof the best course of action under the circumstances. Such assistance\ngoes far beyond mere protection against police badgering.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ness.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827–828 (1991).\n   Paying lip service to the rule of stare decisis, the major\nity acknowledges that the Court must consider many\nfactors before taking the dramatic step of overruling a\npast decision. See ante, at 12. Specifically, the majority\nfocuses on four considerations: the reasoning of the deci\nsion, the workability of the rule, the reliance interests at\nstake, and the antiquity of the precedent. The Court\nexaggerates the considerations favoring reversal, however,\nand gives short shrift to the valid considerations favoring\nretention of the Jackson rule.\n   First, and most central to the Court’s decision to over\nrule Jackson, is its assertion that Jackson’s “ ‘reason\ning’ ”—which the Court defines as “the weighing of the\n[protective] rule’s benefits against its costs,” ante, at 14—\ndoes not justify continued application of the rule it cre\nated. The balancing test the Court performs, however,\ndepends entirely on its misunderstanding of Jackson as a\nrule designed to prevent police badgering, rather than a\nrule designed to safeguard a defendant’s right to rely on\nthe assistance of counsel.3\n   Next, in order to reach the conclusion that the Jackson\n\n——————\n   3 Even accepting the majority’s improper framing of Jackson’s foun\n\ndation, the Court fails to show that the costs of the rule are more than\nnegligible or differ from any other protection afforded by the right to\ncounsel. The majority assumes, without citing any empirical or even\nanecdotal support, that any marginal benefits of the Jackson rule are\n“dwarfed by its substantial costs,” which it describes as harm to “ ‘soci\nety’s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those\nwho violate the law.’ ” Ante, at 14 (quoting Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S.\n412, 426 (1986)). That assumption is highly dubious, particularly in\nlight of the fact that several amici with interest in law enforcement\nhave conceded that the application of Jackson’s protective rule rarely\nimpedes prosecution. See Supplemental Brief for Larry D. Thompson\net al. as Amici Curiae 6 (hereinafter Thompson Supplemental Brief);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12 (hereinafter United States\nBrief).\n8                    MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrule is unworkable, the Court reframes the relevant in\nquiry, asking not whether the Jackson rule as applied for\nthe past quarter century has proved easily administrable,\nbut instead whether the Louisiana Supreme Court’s\ncramped interpretation of that rule is practically worka\nble. The answer to that question, of course, is no. When\nframed more broadly, however, the evidence is overwhelm\ning that Jackson’s simple, bright-line rule has done more\nto advance effective law enforcement than to undermine it.\n  In a supplemental brief submitted by lawyers and\njudges with extensive experience in law enforcement and\nprosecution, amici Larry D. Thompson et al. argue per\nsuasively that Jackson’s bright-line rule has provided law\nenforcement officers with clear guidance, allowed prosecu\ntors to quickly and easily assess whether confessions will\nbe admissible in court, and assisted judges in determining\nwhether a defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights have been\nviolated by police interrogation. See generally Thompson\nSupplemental Brief 6. While amici acknowledge that\n“Jackson reduces opportunities to interrogate defendants”\nand “may require exclusion of evidence that could support\na criminal conviction,” they maintain that “it is a rare case\nwhere this rule lets a guilty defendant go free.” Ibid.\nNotably, these representations are not contradicted by the\nState of Louisiana or other amici, including the United\nStates. See United States Brief 12 (conceding that the\nJackson rule has not “resulted in the suppression of sig\nnificant numbers of statements in federal prosecutions in\nthe past”).4 In short, there is substantial evidence sug\n——————\n  4 Further supporting the workability of the Jackson rule is the fact\n\nthat it aligns with the professional standards and norms that already\ngovern the behavior of police and prosecutors. Rules of Professional\nConduct endorsed by the American Bar Association (ABA) and by every\nState Bar Association in the country prohibit prosecutors from making\ndirect contact with represented defendants in all but the most limited\nof circumstances, see App. to Supplemental Brief for Public Defender\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

See\nante, at 12. Again as a result of its mistaken understand\ning of the purpose behind Jackson’s protective rule, the\nCourt fails to identify the real reliance interest at issue in\nthis case: the public’s interest in knowing that counsel,\nonce secured, may be reasonably relied upon as a medium\nbetween the accused and the power of the State. That\ninterest lies at the heart of the Sixth Amendment’s guar\nantee, and is surely worthy of greater consideration than\nit is given by today’s decision.\n   Finally, although the Court acknowledges that “antiq\nuity” is a factor that counsels in favor of retaining prece\ndent, it concludes that the fact Jackson is “only two dec\nades old” cuts “in favor of abandoning” the rule it\nestablished.

Such a decision can only diminish the public’s\nconfidence in the reliability and fairness of our system of\njustice.5\n                            III\n   Even if Jackson had never been decided, it would be\nclear that Montejo’s Sixth Amendment rights were vio\nlated.

Nevertheless, under\nthe undisputed facts of this case, there is no sound basis\nfor concluding that Montejo made a knowing and valid\nwaiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel before\nacquiescing in police interrogation following his 72-hour\nhearing.

S. ___ (2009). While I agree that the reasoning in his\ndissent supports my position in this case, I do not agree with his\ncharacterization of our opinion in Gant. Contrary to his representation,\nthe Court did not overrule our precedent in New York v. Belton, 453\nU. S. 454 (1981). Rather, we affirmed the narrow interpretation of\nBelton’s holding adopted by the Arizona Supreme Court, rejecting the\nbroader interpretation adopted by other lower courts that had been\nroundly criticized by judges and scholars alike. By contrast, in this\ncase the Court flatly overrules Jackson—a rule that has drawn virtu\nally no criticism—on its own initiative. The two cases are hardly\ncomparable. If they were, and if JUSTICE ALITO meant what he said in\nGant, I would expect him to join this opinion.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S., at\n176. The Sixth Amendment entitles indicted defendants\nto have counsel notified of and present during critical\nconfrontations with the state throughout the pretrial\nprocess. Given the realities of modern criminal prosecu\ntion, the critical proceedings at which counsel’s assistance\nis required more and more often occur outside the court\nroom in pretrial proceedings “where the results might well\nsettle the accused’s fate and reduce the trial itself to a\nmere formality.” United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218,\n224 (1967).\n   In Wade, for instance, we held that because a post\nindictment lineup conducted for identification purposes is\na critical stage of the criminal proceedings, a defendant\nand his counsel are constitutionally entitled to notice of\nthe impending lineup. Accordingly, counsel’s presence is a\n“requisite to conduct of the lineup, absent an intelligent\nwaiver.” Id., at 237 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe same reasoning applies to police decisions to interro\ngate represented defendants. For if the Sixth Amendment\nentitles an accused to such robust protection during a\nlineup, surely it entitles him to such protection during a\ncustodial interrogation, when the stakes are as high or\nhigher. Cf. Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 (1959)\n(Douglas, J., concurring) (“[W]hat use is a defendant’s\nright to effective counsel at every stage of a criminal case\nif, while he is held awaiting trial, he can be questioned in\nthe absence of counsel until he confesses?”).\n   The Court avoids confronting the serious Sixth Amend\nment concerns raised by the police interrogation in this\n12                    MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncase by assuming that Montejo validly waived his Sixth\nAmendment rights before submitting to interrogation.6 It\ndoes so by summarily concluding that “doctrines ensuring\nvoluntariness of the Fifth Amendment waiver simultane\nously ensure the voluntariness of the Sixth Amendment\nwaiver,” ante, at 15–16; thus, because Montejo was given\nMiranda warnings prior to interrogation, his waiver was\npresumptively valid. Ironically, while the Court faults\nJackson for blurring the line between this Court’s Fifth\nand Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, it commits the same\nerror by assuming that the Miranda warnings given in\nthis case, designed purely to safeguard the Fifth Amend\nment right against self-incrimination, were somehow\nadequate to protect Montejo’s more robust Sixth Amend\nment right to counsel.\n    The majority’s cursory treatment of the waiver question\nrests entirely on the dubious decision in Patterson, in\nwhich we addressed whether, by providing Miranda warn\nings, police had adequately advised an indicted but unrep\nresented defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to coun\nsel. The majority held that “[a]s a general matter . . . an\naccused who is admonished with the warnings prescribed\n. . . in Miranda, . . . has been sufficiently apprised of the\nnature of his Sixth Amendment rights, and of the conse\nquences of abandoning those rights.” 487 U.

See ante, at 18. While such police\ndeception would obviously invalidate any otherwise valid waiver of\nMontejo’s Sixth Amendment rights, Montejo has a strong argument\nthat, given his status as a represented criminal defendant, the Miranda\nwarnings given to him by police were insufficient to permit him to\nmake a knowing waiver of his Sixth Amendment rights even absent\npolice deception.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

See 487 U. S., at 307 (dissenting opinion).\nBecause Miranda warnings do not hint at the ways in\nwhich a lawyer might assist her client during conversa\ntions with the police, I remain convinced that the warn\nings prescribed in Miranda,7 while sufficient to apprise a\ndefendant of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,\nare inadequate to inform an unrepresented, indicted de\nfendant of his Sixth Amendment right to have a lawyer\npresent at all critical stages of a criminal prosecution. The\ninadequacy of those warnings is even more obvious in the\ncase of a represented defendant. While it can be argued\nthat informing an indicted but unrepresented defendant of\nhis right to counsel at least alerts him to the fact that he is\nentitled to obtain something he does not already possess,\nproviding that same warning to a defendant who has\nalready secured counsel is more likely to confound than\nenlighten.8 By glibly assuming that that the Miranda\n——————\n  7 Under Miranda, a suspect must be “warned prior to any questioning\n\nthat he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says may be\nused against him in court of law, that he has the right to the presence\nof any attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney, one will be\nappointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.” 384 U.

Given the\nhigh stakes of making such a choice and the potential\nvalue of counsel’s advice and mediation at that critical\nstage of the criminal proceedings, it is imperative that a\ndefendant possess “a full awareness of both the nature of\nthe right being abandoned and the consequences of the\ndecision to abandon it,” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412,\n421 (1986), before his waiver is deemed valid. See Iowa v.\nTovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458, 464 (1938). Because the administration of\nMiranda warnings was insufficient to ensure Montejo\nunderstood the Sixth Amendment right he was being\nasked to surrender, the record in this case provides no\nbasis for concluding that Montejo validly waived his right\nto counsel, even in the absence of Jackson’s enhanced\nprotections.\n                            IV\n  The Court’s decision to overrule Jackson is unwar\nranted.

LOUISIANA\n\n      CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA\n\n    No. 07–1529. Argued January 13, 2009—Decided May 26, 2009\nAt a preliminary hearing required by Louisiana law, petitioner Montejo\n  was charged with first-degree murder, and the court ordered the ap\n  pointment of counsel. Later that day, the police read Montejo his\n  rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and he agreed to go\n  along on a trip to locate the murder weapon. During the excursion,\n  he wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim’s widow. Upon\n  returning, he finally met his court-appointed attorney. At trial, his\n  letter was admitted over defense objection, and he was convicted and\n  sentenced to death. Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected his\n  claim that the letter should have been suppressed under the rule of\n  Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, which forbids police to initiate\n  interrogation of a criminal defendant once he has invoked his right to\n  counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding. The court reasoned\n  that Jackson’s prophylactic protection is not triggered unless the de\n  fendant has actually requested a lawyer or has otherwise asserted\n  his Sixth Amendment right to counsel; and that, since Montejo stood\n  mute at his hearing while the judge ordered the appointment of\n  counsel, he had made no such request or assertion.\nHeld:\n    1. Michigan v. Jackson should be and now is overruled. Pp. 3–18.\n       (a) The State Supreme Court’s interpretation of Jackson would\n lead to practical problems. Requiring an initial “invocation” of the\n right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson presumption, as the\n court below did, might work in States that require an indigent defen\n dant formally to request counsel before an appointment is made, but\n not in more than half the States, which appoint counsel without re\n quest from the defendant. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) On the other hand, Montejo’s solution is untenable as a theo\n retical and doctrinal matter. Eliminating the invocation requirement\n2                       MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    entirely would depart fundamentally from the rationale of Jackson,\n    whose presumption was created by analogy to a similar prophylactic\n    rule established in Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, to protect the\n    Fifth Amendment-based Miranda right. Both Edwards and Jackson\n    are meant to prevent police from badgering defendants into changing\n    their minds about the right to counsel once they have invoked it, but\n    a defendant who never asked for counsel has not yet made up his\n    mind in the first instance. Pp. 6–13.\n          (c) Stare decisis does not require the Court to expand signifi\n    cantly the holding of a prior decision in order to cure its practical de\n    ficiencies. To the contrary, the fact that a decision has proved “un\n    workable” is a traditional ground for overruling it. Payne v.\n    Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. Beyond workability, the relevant fac\n    tors include the precedent’s antiquity, the reliance interests at stake,\n    and whether the decision was well reasoned. Pearson v. Callahan,\n    555 U. S. ___, ___. The first two cut in favor of jettisoning Jackson:\n    the opinion is only two decades old, and eliminating it would not up\n    set expectations, since any criminal defendant learned enough to or\n    der his affairs based on Jackson’s rule would also be perfectly capable\n    of interacting with the police on his own. As for the strength of Jack\n    son’s reasoning, when this Court creates a prophylactic rule to pro\n    tect a constitutional right, the relevant “reasoning” is the weighing of\n    the rule’s benefits against its costs. Jackson’s marginal benefits are\n    dwarfed by its substantial costs. Even without Jackson, few badger\n    ing-induced waivers, if any, would be admitted at trial because the\n    Court has taken substantial other, overlapping measures to exclude\n    them. Under Miranda, any suspect subject to custodial interrogation\n    must be advised of his right to have a lawyer present. 384 U. S., at\n    474. Under Edwards, once such a defendant “has invoked his\n    [Miranda] right,” interrogation must stop. 451 U. S., at 484. And\n    under Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, no subsequent interro\n    gation may take place until counsel is present. Id., at 153. These\n    three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient. On the other side of the\n    equation, the principal cost of applying Jackson’s rule is that crimes\n    can go unsolved and criminals unpunished when uncoerced confes\n    sions are excluded and when officers are deterred from even trying to\n    obtain confessions. The Court concludes that the Jackson rule does\n    not “pay its way,” United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907–908, n. 6,\n    and thus the case should be overruled. Pp. 13–18.\n       2. Montejo should nonetheless be given an opportunity to contend\n    that his letter of apology should have been suppressed under the Ed\n    wards rule. He understandably did not pursue an Edwards objec\n    tion, because Jackson offered broader protections, but the decision\n    here changes the legal landscape.

S. 625 (1986), forbidding police to initiate\ninterrogation of a criminal defendant once he has re\nquested counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding.\n                              I\n  Petitioner Jesse Montejo was arrested on September 6,\n2002, in connection with the robbery and murder of Lewis\nFerrari, who had been found dead in his own home one\nday earlier. Suspicion quickly focused on Jerry Moore, a\ndisgruntled former employee of Ferrari’s dry cleaning\nbusiness. Police sought to question Montejo, who was a\nknown associate of Moore.\n  Montejo waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U. S. 436 (1966), and was interrogated at the sheriff’s\noffice by police detectives through the late afternoon and\nevening of September 6 and the early morning of Septem\nber 7. During the interrogation, Montejo repeatedly\nchanged his account of the crime, at first claiming that he\n2                     MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhad only driven Moore to the victim’s home, and ulti\nmately admitting that he had shot and killed Ferrari in\nthe course of a botched burglary. These police interroga\ntions were videotaped.\n   On September 10, Montejo was brought before a judge\nfor what is known in Louisiana as a “72-hour hearing”—a\npreliminary hearing required under state law.1 Although\nthe proceedings were not transcribed, the minute record\nindicates what transpired: “The defendant being charged\nwith First Degree Murder, Court ordered N[o] Bond set in\nthis matter. Further, Court ordered the Office of Indigent\nDefender be appointed to represent the defendant.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 63a.\n   Later that same day, two police detectives visited Mon\ntejo back at the prison and requested that he accompany\nthem on an excursion to locate the murder weapon (which\nMontejo had earlier indicated he had thrown into a lake).\nAfter some back-and-forth, the substance of which re\nmains in dispute, Montejo was again read his Miranda\nrights and agreed to go along; during the excursion, he\nwrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim’s\nwidow. Only upon their return did Montejo finally meet\nhis court-appointed attorney, who was quite upset that the\ndetectives had interrogated his client in his absence.\n   At trial, the letter of apology was admitted over defense\nobjection. The jury convicted Montejo of first-degree mur\nder, and he was sentenced to death.\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the conviction\nand sentence. 06–1807 (1/16/08), 974 So. 2d 1238 (2008).\nAs relevant here, the court rejected Montejo’s argument\nthat under the rule of Jackson, supra, the letter should\n——————\n  1 “The sheriff or law enforcement officer having custody of an arrested\n\nperson shall bring him promptly, and in any case within seventy-two\nhours from the time of the arrest, before a judge for the purpose of\nappointment of counsel.” La.

Jackson held\nthat “if police initiate interrogation after a defendant’s\nassertion, at an arraignment or similar proceeding, of his\nright to counsel, any waiver of the defendant’s right to\ncounsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.”\n475 U. S., at 636.\n  Citing a decision of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit, Montoya v. Collins, 955 F. 2d 279\n(1992), the Louisiana Supreme Court reasoned that the\nprophylactic protection of Jackson is not triggered unless\nand until the defendant has actually requested a lawyer or\nhas otherwise asserted his Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel. 974 So. 2d, at 1260–1261, and n. 68. Because\nMontejo simply stood mute at his 72-hour hearing while\nthe judge ordered the appointment of counsel, he had\nmade no such request or assertion. So the proper inquiry,\nthe court ruled, was only whether he had knowingly,\nintelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to have\ncounsel present during the interaction with the police. Id.,\nat 1261. And because Montejo had been read his Miranda\nrights and agreed to waive them, the Court answered that\nquestion in the affirmative, 974 So. 2d, at 1262, and up\nheld the conviction.\n  We granted certiorari. 554 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                            II\n   Montejo and his amici raise a number of pragmatic\nobjections to the Louisiana Supreme Court’s interpreta\ntion of Jackson. We agree that the approach taken below\nwould lead either to an unworkable standard, or to arbi\ntrary and anomalous distinctions between defendants in\ndifferent States. Neither would be acceptable.\n   Under the rule adopted by the Louisiana Supreme\nCourt, a criminal defendant must request counsel, or\notherwise “assert” his Sixth Amendment right at the\npreliminary hearing, before the Jackson protections are\n4                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntriggered. If he does so, the police may not initiate further\ninterrogation in the absence of counsel. But if the court on\nits own appoints counsel, with the defendant taking no\naffirmative action to invoke his right to counsel, then\npolice are free to initiate further interrogations provided\nthat they first obtain an otherwise valid waiver by the\ndefendant of his right to have counsel present.\n   This rule would apply well enough in States that require\nthe indigent defendant formally to request counsel before\nany appointment is made, which usually occurs after the\ncourt has informed him that he will receive counsel if he\nasks for it. That is how the system works in Michigan, for\nexample, Mich. Ct. Rule 6.005(A) (2009), whose scheme\nproduced the factual background for this Court’s decision\nin Michigan v. Jackson. Jackson, like all other repre\nsented indigent defendants in the State, had requested\ncounsel in accordance with the applicable state law.\n   But many States follow other practices. In some two\ndozen, the appointment of counsel is automatic upon a\nfinding of indigency, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. §22–4503(c)\n(2007); and in a number of others, appointment can be\nmade either upon the defendant’s request or sua sponte by\nthe court, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 29, §4602(a) (2003).\nSee App. to Brief for National Legal Aid & Defender Assn.\net al. as Amici Curiae 1a–21a. Nothing in our Jackson\nopinion indicates whether we were then aware that not all\nStates require that a defendant affirmatively request\ncounsel before one is appointed; and of course we had no\noccasion there to decide how the rule we announced would\napply to these other States.\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court’s answer to that unre\nsolved question is troublesome. The central distinction it\ndraws—between defendants who “assert” their right to\ncounsel and those who do not—is exceedingly hazy when\napplied to States that appoint counsel absent request from\nthe defendant. How to categorize a defendant who merely\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasks, prior to appointment, whether he will be appointed\ncounsel? Or who inquires, after the fact, whether he has\nbeen? What treatment for one who thanks the court after\nthe appointment is made? And if the court asks a defen\ndant whether he would object to appointment, will a quick\nshake of his head count as an assertion of his right?\n  To the extent that the Louisiana Supreme Court’s rule\nalso permits a defendant to trigger Jackson through the\n“acceptance” of counsel, that notion is even more mysteri\nous: How does one affirmatively accept counsel appointed\nby court order? An indigent defendant has no right to\nchoose his counsel, United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\nU. S. 140, 151 (2006), so it is hard to imagine what his\n“acceptance” would look like, beyond the passive silence\nthat Montejo exhibited.\n  In practice, judicial application of the Louisiana rule in\nStates that do not require a defendant to make a request\nfor counsel could take either of two paths. Courts might\nask on a case-by-case basis whether a defendant has\nsomehow invoked his right to counsel, looking to his con\nduct at the preliminary hearing—his statements and\ngestures—and the totality of the circumstances. Or,\ncourts might simply determine as a categorical matter\nthat defendants in these States—over half of those in the\nUnion—simply have no opportunity to assert their right to\ncounsel at the hearing and are therefore out of luck.\n  Neither approach is desirable. The former would be\nparticularly impractical in light of the fact that, as amici\ndescribe, preliminary hearings are often rushed, and are\nfrequently not recorded or transcribed. Brief for National\nLegal Aid & Defender Assn. et al. 25–30. The sheer vol\nume of indigent defendants, see id., at 29, would render\nthe monitoring of each particular defendant’s reaction to\nthe appointment of counsel almost impossible. And some\ntimes the defendant is not even present. E.g., La. Code\nCrim. Proc. Ann., Art. 230.1(A) (West Supp. 2009) (allow\n6                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning court to appoint counsel if defendant is “unable to\nappear”). Police who did not attend the hearing would\nhave no way to know whether they could approach a par\nticular defendant; and for a court to adjudicate that ques\ntion ex post would be a fact-intensive and burdensome\ntask, even if monitoring were possible and transcription\navailable. Because “clarity of . . . command” and “cer\ntainty of . . . application” are crucial in rules that govern\nlaw enforcement, Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146,\n151 (1990), this would be an unfortunate way to proceed.\nSee also Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 425–426 (1986).\n   The second possible course fares no better, for it would\nachieve clarity and certainty only at the expense of intro\nducing arbitrary distinctions: Defendants in States that\nautomatically appoint counsel would have no opportunity\nto invoke their rights and trigger Jackson, while those in\nother States, effectively instructed by the court to request\ncounsel, would be lucky winners. That sort of hollow\nformalism is out of place in a doctrine that purports to\nserve as a practical safeguard for defendants’ rights.\n                             III\n  But if the Louisiana Supreme Court’s application of\nJackson is unsound as a practical matter, then Montejo’s\nsolution is untenable as a theoretical and doctrinal matter.\nUnder his approach, once a defendant is represented by\ncounsel, police may not initiate any further interrogation.\nSuch a rule would be entirely untethered from the original\nrationale of Jackson.\n                                A\n  It is worth emphasizing first what is not in dispute or at\nstake here. Under our precedents, once the adversary\njudicial process has been initiated, the Sixth Amendment\nguarantees a defendant the right to have counsel present\nat all “critical” stages of the criminal proceedings. United\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 227–228 (1967); Powell v.\nAlabama, 287 U. S. 45, 57 (1932). Interrogation by the\nState is such a stage. Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S.\n201, 204–205 (1964); see also United States v. Henry, 447\nU. S. 264, 274 (1980).\n  Our precedents also place beyond doubt that the Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel may be waived by a defen\ndant, so long as relinquishment of the right is voluntary,\nknowing, and intelligent. Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S.\n285, 292, n. 4 (1988); Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387,\n404 (1977); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938).\nThe defendant may waive the right whether or not he is\nalready represented by counsel; the decision to waive need\nnot itself be counseled. Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344,\n352–353 (1990). And when a defendant is read his\nMiranda rights (which include the right to have counsel\npresent during interrogation) and agrees to waive those\nrights, that typically does the trick, even though the\nMiranda rights purportedly have their source in the Fifth\nAmendment:\n    “As a general matter . . . an accused who is admon\n    ished with the warnings prescribed by this Court in\n    Miranda . . . has been sufficiently apprised of the na\n    ture of his Sixth Amendment rights, and of the conse\n    quences of abandoning those rights, so that his waiver\n    on this basis will be considered a knowing and intelli\n    gent one.” Patterson, supra, at 296.\n   The only question raised by this case, and the only one\naddressed by the Jackson rule, is whether courts must\npresume that such a waiver is invalid under certain cir\ncumstances. 475 U. S., at 630, 633. We created such a\npresumption in Jackson by analogy to a similar prophylac\ntic rule established to protect the Fifth Amendment based\nMiranda right to have counsel present at any custodial\ninterrogation. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981),\n8                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndecided that once “an accused has invoked his right to\nhave counsel present during custodial interrogation . . .\n[he] is not subject to further interrogation by the authori\nties until counsel has been made available,” unless he\ninitiates the contact. Id., at 484–485.\n   The Edwards rule is “designed to prevent police from\nbadgering a defendant into waiving his previously as\nserted Miranda rights,” Harvey, supra, at 350. It does this\nby presuming his postassertion statements to be involun\ntary, “even where the suspect executes a waiver and his\nstatements would be considered voluntary under tradi\ntional standards.” McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 177\n(1991). This prophylactic rule thus “protect[s] a suspect’s\nvoluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer’s pres\nence.” Texas v. Cobb, 532 U. S. 162, 175 (2001) (KENNEDY,\nJ., concurring).\n   Jackson represented a “wholesale importation of the\nEdwards rule into the Sixth Amendment.” Cobb, supra, at\n175. The Jackson Court decided that a request for counsel\nat an arraignment should be treated as an invocation of\nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel “at every critical\nstage of the prosecution,” 475 U. S., at 633, despite doubt\nthat defendants “actually inten[d] their request for counsel\nto encompass representation during any further question\ning,” id., at 632–633, because doubts must be “resolved in\nfavor of protecting the constitutional claim,” id., at 633.\nCiting Edwards, the Court held that any subsequent\nwaiver would thus be “insufficient to justify police\ninitiated interrogation.” 475 U. S., at 635. In other words,\nwe presume such waivers involuntary “based on the sup\nposition that suspects who assert their right to counsel are\nunlikely to waive that right voluntarily” in subsequent\ninteractions with police. Harvey, supra, at 350.\n   The dissent presents us with a revisionist view of Jack\nson. The defendants’ request for counsel, it contends, was\nimportant only because it proved that counsel had been\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nappointed. Such a non sequitur (nowhere alluded to in the\ncase) hardly needs rebuttal. Proceeding from this fanciful\npremise, the dissent claims that the decision actually\nestablished “a rule designed to safeguard a defendant’s\nright to rely on the assistance of counsel,” post, at 6–7\n(opinion of STEVENS, J.), not one “designed to prevent\npolice badgering,” post, at 7. To safeguard the right to\nassistance of counsel from what? From a knowing and\nvoluntary waiver by the defendant himself? Unless the\ndissent seeks to prevent a defendant altogether from\nwaiving his Sixth Amendment rights, i.e., to “imprison a\nman in his privileges and call it the Constitution,” Adams\nv. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U. S. 269, 280\n(1942)—a view with zero support in reason, history or case\nlaw—the answer must be: from police pressure, i.e., badg\nering. The antibadgering rationale is the only way to\nmake sense of Jackson’s repeated citations of Edwards,\nand the only way to reconcile the opinion with our waiver\njurisprudence.2\n                            B\n  With this understanding of what Jackson stands for and\nwhence it came, it should be clear that Montejo’s interpre\ntation of that decision—that no represented defendant can\never be approached by the State and asked to consent to\ninterrogation—is off the mark. When a court appoints\ncounsel for an indigent defendant in the absence of any\nrequest on his part, there is no basis for a presumption\n——————\n   2 The dissent responds that Jackson also ensures that the defendant’s\n\ncounsel receives notice of any interrogation, post, at 6, n. 2.\nBut notice to what end? Surely not in order to protect some constitu\ntional right to receive counsel’s advice regarding waiver of the right to\nhave counsel present. Contrary to the dissent’s intimations, neither the\nadvice nor the presence of counsel is needed in order to effectuate a\nknowing waiver of the Sixth Amendment right. Our cases make clear\nthat the Miranda waivers typically suffice; indeed, even an unrepre\nsented defendant can waive his right to counsel. See supra, at 7.\n10                MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat any subsequent waiver of the right to counsel will be\ninvoluntary. There is no “initial election” to exercise the\nright, Patterson, 487 U. S., at 291, that must be preserved\nthrough a prophylactic rule against later waivers. No\nreason exists to assume that a defendant like Montejo,\nwho has done nothing at all to express his intentions with\nrespect to his Sixth Amendment rights, would not be\nperfectly amenable to speaking with the police without\nhaving counsel present. And no reason exists to prohibit\nthe police from inquiring. Edwards and Jackson are\nmeant to prevent police from badgering defendants into\nchanging their minds about their rights, but a defendant\nwho never asked for counsel has not yet made up his mind\nin the first instance.\n  The dissent’s argument to the contrary rests on a flawed\na fortiori: “If a defendant is entitled to protection from\npolice-initiated interrogation under the Sixth Amendment\nwhen he merely requests a lawyer, he is even more obvi\nously entitled to such protection when he has secured a\nlawyer.” Post, at 3. The question in Jackson, however,\nwas not whether respondents were entitled to counsel\n(they unquestionably were), but “whether respondents\nvalidly waived their right to counsel,” 475 U. S., at 630;\nand even if it is reasonable to presume from a defendant’s\nrequest for counsel that any subsequent waiver of the right\nwas coerced, no such presumption can seriously be enter\ntained when a lawyer was merely “secured” on the defen\ndant’s behalf, by the State itself, as a matter of course. Of\ncourse, reading the dissent’s analysis, one would have no\nidea that Montejo executed any waiver at all.\n  In practice, Montejo’s rule would prevent police-initiated\ninterrogation entirely once the Sixth Amendment right\nattaches, at least in those States that appoint counsel\npromptly without request from the defendant. As the\ndissent in Jackson pointed out, with no expressed dis\nagreement from the majority, the opinion “most assuredly\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n[did] not hold that the Edwards per se rule prohibiting all\npolice-initiated interrogations applies from the moment\nthe defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel at\ntaches, with or without a request for counsel by the defen\ndant.” 475 U. S., at 640 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.). That\nwould have constituted a “shockingly dramatic restructur\ning of the balance this Court has traditionally struck\nbetween the rights of the defendant and those of the larger\nsociety.” Ibid.\n  Montejo’s rule appears to have its theoretical roots in\ncodes of legal ethics, not the Sixth Amendment. The\nAmerican Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional\nConduct (which nearly all States have adopted into law in\nwhole or in part) mandate that “a lawyer shall not com\nmunicate about the subject of [a] representation with a\nparty the lawyer knows to be represented by another\nlawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of\nthe other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court\norder.” Model Rule 4.2 (2008). But the Constitution does\nnot codify the ABA’s Model Rules, and does not make\ninvestigating police officers lawyers. Montejo’s proposed\nrule is both broader and narrower than the Model Rule.\nBroader, because Montejo would apply it to all agents of\nthe State, including the detectives who interrogated him,\nwhile the ethical rule governs only lawyers. And nar\nrower, because he agrees that if a defendant initiates\ncontact with the police, they may talk freely—whereas a\nlawyer could be sanctioned for interviewing a represented\nparty even if that party “initiates” the communication and\nconsents to the interview. Model Rule 4.2, Comment 3.\n  Montejo contends that our decisions support his inter\npretation of the Jackson rule. We think not. Many of the\ncases he cites concern the substantive scope of the Sixth\nAmendment—e.g., whether a particular interaction with\nthe State constitutes a “critical” stage at which counsel is\nentitled to be present—not the validity of a Sixth Amend\n12                     MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nment waiver. See Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159 (1985);\nHenry, 447 U. S. 264; Massiah, 377 U. S. 201; see also\nMoran, 475 U. S. 412. Since everyone agrees that absent a\nvalid waiver, Montejo was entitled to a lawyer during the\ninterrogation, those cases do not advance his argument.\n   Montejo also points to descriptions of the Jackson hold\ning in two later cases. In one, we noted that “analysis of\nthe waiver issue changes” once a defendant “obtains or\neven requests counsel.” Harvey, 494 U. S., at 352. But\nelsewhere in the same opinion, we explained that Jackson\napplies “after a defendant requests assistance of counsel,”\n494 U. S., at 349; “when a suspect charged with a crime\nrequests counsel outside the context of interrogation,” id.,\nat 350; and to “suspects who assert their right to counsel,”\nibid. The accuracy of the “obtains” language is thus ques\ntionable. Anyway, since Harvey held that evidence ob\ntained in violation of the Jackson rule could be admitted\nto impeach the defendant’s trial testimony, 494 U. S., at\n346, the Court’s varying descriptions of when the rule was\nviolated were dicta. The dictum from the other decision,\nPatterson, supra, at 290, n. 3, is no more probative.3\n   The upshot is that even on Jackson’s own terms, it\n\n——————\n  3 In the cited passage, the Court noted that “[o]nce an accused has a\n\nlawyer, a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserving\nthe sanctity of attorney-client relationship takes effect.” Patterson, 487\nU. S., at 290, n. 3. To support that proposition, the Court cited Maine\nv. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159 (1985), which was not a case about waiver.\nThe passage went on to observe that “the analysis changes markedly\nonce an accused even requests the assistance of counsel,” 487 U. S., at\n290, n. 3 (emphasis in original), this time citing Jackson. Montejo\ninfers from the “even requests” that having counsel is more conclusive of\nthe invalidity of uncounseled waiver than the mere requesting of\ncounsel. But the Patterson footnote did not suggest that the analysis\n“changes” in both these scenarios (having a lawyer, versus requesting\none) with specific reference to the validity of waivers under the Sixth\nAmendment. The citation of Moulton (a nonwaiver case) for the first\nscenario suggests just the opposite.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould be completely unjustified to presume that a defen\ndant’s consent to police-initiated interrogation was invol\nuntary or coerced simply because he had previously been\nappointed a lawyer.\n                             IV\n   So on the one hand, requiring an initial “invocation” of\nthe right to counsel in order to trigger the Jackson pre\nsumption is consistent with the theory of that decision, but\n(as Montejo and his amici argue, see Part II, supra) would\nbe unworkable in more than half the States of the Union.\nOn the other hand, eliminating the invocation require\nment would render the rule easy to apply but depart fun\ndamentally from the Jackson rationale.\n   We do not think that stare decisis requires us to expand\nsignificantly the holding of a prior decision—\nfundamentally revising its theoretical basis in the proc\ness—in order to cure its practical deficiencies. To the\ncontrary, the fact that a decision has proved “unworkable”\nis a traditional ground for overruling it. Payne v. Tennes\nsee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991). Accordingly, we called for\nsupplemental briefing addressed to the question whether\nMichigan v. Jackson should be overruled.\n   Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding\nwhether to adhere to the principle of stare decisis include\nthe antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at\nstake, and of course whether the decision was well rea\nsoned. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip\nop., at 8). The first two cut in favor of abandoning Jack\nson: the opinion is only two decades old, and eliminating it\nwould not upset expectations. Any criminal defendant\nlearned enough to order his affairs based on the rule\nannounced in Jackson would also be perfectly capable of\ninteracting with the police on his own. Of course it is\nlikely true that police and prosecutors have been trained\nto comply with Jackson, see generally Supplemental Brief\n14                     MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nfor Larry D. Thompson et al. as Amici Curiae, but that is\nhardly a basis for retaining it as a constitutional require\nment. If a State wishes to abstain from requesting inter\nviews with represented defendants when counsel is not\npresent, it obviously may continue to do so.4\n  Which brings us to the strength of Jackson’s reasoning.\nWhen this Court creates a prophylactic rule in order to\nprotect a constitutional right, the relevant “reasoning” is\nthe weighing of the rule’s benefits against its costs. “The\nvalue of any prophylactic rule . . . must be assessed not\nonly on the basis of what is gained, but also on the basis of\nwhat is lost.” Minnick, 498 U. S., at 161 (SCALIA, J., dis\nsenting). We think that the marginal benefits of Jackson\n(viz., the number of confessions obtained coercively that\nare suppressed by its bright-line rule and would otherwise\nhave been admitted) are dwarfed by its substantial costs\n(viz., hindering “society’s compelling interest in finding,\nconvicting, and punishing those who violate the law,”\nMoran, supra, at 426).\n  What does the Jackson rule actually achieve by way of\npreventing unconstitutional conduct? Recall that the\npurpose of the rule is to preclude the State from badgering\ndefendants into waiving their previously asserted rights.\nSee Harvey, supra, at 350; see also McNeil, 501 U. S., at\n177. The effect of this badgering might be to coerce a\nwaiver, which would render the subsequent interrogation\na violation of the Sixth Amendment. See Massiah, supra,\nat 204. Even though involuntary waivers are invalid even\n——————\n  4 The dissent posits a different reliance interest: “the public’s interest\nin knowing that counsel, once secured, may be reasonably relied upon\nas a medium between the accused and the power of the State,” post, at\n9. We suspect the public would be surprised to learn that a criminal\ncan freely sign away his right to a lawyer, confess his crimes, and then\nask the courts to assume that the confession was coerced—on the\nground that he had, at some earlier point in time, made a pro forma\nstatement requesting that counsel be appointed on his behalf.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napart from Jackson, see Patterson, 487 U. S., at 292, n. 4,\nmistakes are of course possible when courts conduct case\nby-case voluntariness review. A bright-line rule like that\nadopted in Jackson ensures that no fruits of interrogations\nmade possible by badgering-induced involuntary waivers\nare ever erroneously admitted at trial.\n   But without Jackson, how many would be? The answer\nis few if any. The principal reason is that the Court has\nalready taken substantial other, overlapping measures\ntoward the same end. Under Miranda’s prophylactic\nprotection of the right against compelled self\nincrimination, any suspect subject to custodial interroga\ntion has the right to have a lawyer present if he so re\nquests, and to be advised of that right. 384 U. S., at 474.\nUnder Edwards’ prophylactic protection of the Miranda\nright, once such a defendant “has invoked his right to have\ncounsel present,” interrogation must stop. 451 U. S., at\n484. And under Minnick’s prophylactic protection of the\nEdwards right, no subsequent interrogation may take\nplace until counsel is present, “whether or not the accused\nhas consulted with his attorney.” 498 U. S., at 153.\n   These three layers of prophylaxis are sufficient. Under\nthe Miranda-Edwards-Minnick line of cases (which is not\nin doubt), a defendant who does not want to speak to the\npolice without counsel present need only say as much\nwhen he is first approached and given the Miranda warn\nings. At that point, not only must the immediate contact\nend, but “badgering” by later requests is prohibited. If\nthat regime suffices to protect the integrity of “a suspect’s\nvoluntary choice not to speak outside his lawyer’s pres\nence” before his arraignment, Cobb, 532 U. S., at 175\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring), it is hard to see why it would\nnot also suffice to protect that same choice after arraign\nment, when Sixth Amendment rights have attached. And\nif so, then Jackson is simply superfluous.\n   It is true, as Montejo points out in his supplemental\n16                MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbrief, that the doctrine established by Miranda and Ed\nwards is designed to protect Fifth Amendment, not Sixth\nAmendment, rights. But that is irrelevant. What matters\nis that these cases, like Jackson, protect the right to have\ncounsel during custodial interrogation—which right hap\npens to be guaranteed (once the adversary judicial process\nhas begun) by two sources of law. Since the right under\nboth sources is waived using the same procedure, Patter\nson, supra, at 296, doctrines ensuring voluntariness of the\nFifth Amendment waiver simultaneously ensure the\nvoluntariness of the Sixth Amendment waiver.\n   Montejo also correctly observes that the Miranda-\nEdwards regime is narrower than Jackson in one respect:\nThe former applies only in the context of custodial interro\ngation. If the defendant is not in custody then those deci\nsions do not apply; nor do they govern other, noninterroga\ntive types of interactions between the defendant and the\nState (like pretrial lineups). However, those uncovered\nsituations are the least likely to pose a risk of coerced\nwaivers. When a defendant is not in custody, he is in\ncontrol, and need only shut his door or walk away to avoid\npolice badgering. And noninterrogative interactions with\nthe State do not involve the “inherently compelling pres\nsures,” Miranda, supra, at 467, that one might reasonably\nfear could lead to involuntary waivers.\n   Jackson was policy driven, and if that policy is being\nadequately served through other means, there is no reason\nto retain its rule. Miranda and the cases that elaborate\nupon it already guarantee not simply noncoercion in the\ntraditional sense, but what Justice Harlan referred to as\n“voluntariness with a vengeance,” 384 U. S., at 505 (dis\nsenting opinion). There is no need to take Jackson’s fur\nther step of requiring voluntariness on stilts.\n   On the other side of the equation are the costs of adding\nthe bright-line Jackson rule on top of Edwards and other\nextant protections. The principal cost of applying any\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexclusionary rule “is, of course, letting guilty and possibly\ndangerous criminals go free . . . .” Herring v. United\nStates, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6). Jackson\nnot only “operates to invalidate a confession given by the\nfree choice of suspects who have received proper advice of\ntheir Miranda rights but waived them nonetheless,” Cobb,\nsupra, at 174–175 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), but also\ndeters law enforcement officers from even trying to obtain\nvoluntary confessions. The “ready ability to obtain unco\nerced confessions is not an evil but an unmitigated good.”\nMcNeil, 501 U. S., at 181. Without these confessions,\ncrimes go unsolved and criminals unpunished. These are\nnot negligible costs, and in our view the Jackson Court\ngave them too short shrift.5\n   Notwithstanding this calculus, Montejo and his amici\nurge the retention of Jackson. Their principal objection to\nits elimination is that the Edwards regime which remains\nwill not provide an administrable rule. But this Court has\npraised Edwards precisely because it provides “ ‘clear and\nunequivocal’ guidelines to the law enforcement profes\nsion,” Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 682 (1988). Our\ncases make clear which sorts of statements trigger its\nprotections, see Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 459\n(1994), and once triggered, the rule operates as a bright\nline. Montejo expresses concern that courts will have to\ndetermine whether statements made at preliminary hear\nings constitute Edwards invocations—thus implicating all\nthe practical problems of the Louisiana rule we discussed\nabove, see Part II, supra. That concern is misguided. “We\n——————\n  5 The dissent claims that, in fact, few confessions have been sup\n\npressed by federal courts applying Jackson. Post, at 8. If so, that is\nbecause, as the dissent boasts, “generations of police officers have been\ntrained to refrain from approaching represented defendants,” post, at 9,\nn. 4. Anyway, if the rule truly does not hinder law enforcement or\nmake much practical difference, see post, at 7–9, and nn. 3–4, then\nthere is no reason to be particularly exercised about its demise.\n18                 MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhave in fact never held that a person can invoke his\nMiranda rights anticipatorily, in a context other than\n‘custodial interrogation’. . . .” McNeil, supra, at 182, n. 3.\nWhat matters for Miranda and Edwards is what happens\nwhen the defendant is approached for interrogation, and\n(if he consents) what happens during the interrogation—\nnot what happened at any preliminary hearing.\n   In sum, when the marginal benefits of the Jackson rule\nare weighed against its substantial costs to the truth\nseeking process and the criminal justice system, we read\nily conclude that the rule does not “pay its way,” United\nStates v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 907–908, n. 6 (1984). Michi\ngan v. Jackson should be and now is overruled.\n                            V\n   Although our holding means that the Louisiana Su\npreme Court correctly rejected Montejo’s claim under\nJackson, we think that Montejo should be given an oppor\ntunity to contend that his letter of apology should still\nhave been suppressed under the rule of Edwards. If Mon\ntejo made a clear assertion of the right to counsel when\nthe officers approached him about accompanying them on\nthe excursion for the murder weapon, then no interroga\ntion should have taken place unless Montejo initiated it.\nDavis, supra, at 459. Even if Montejo subsequently agreed\nto waive his rights, that waiver would have been invalid\nhad it followed an “unequivocal election of the right,”\nCobb, 532 U. S., at 176 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Montejo understandably did not pursue an Edwards\nobjection, because Jackson served as the Sixth Amend\nment analogy to Edwards and offered broader protections.\nOur decision today, overruling Jackson, changes the legal\nlandscape and does so in part based on the protections\nalready provided by Edwards. Thus we think that a re\nmand is appropriate so that Montejo can pursue this\nalternative avenue for relief. Montejo may also seek on\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Moran, 475 U. S., at 428–\n429. These matters have heightened importance in light\nof our opinion today.\n   We do not venture to resolve these issues ourselves, not\nonly because we are a court of final review, “not of first\nview,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005),\nbut also because the relevant facts remain unclear. Mon\ntejo and the police gave inconsistent testimony about\nexactly what took place on the afternoon of September 10,\n2002, and the Louisiana Supreme Court did not make an\nexplicit credibility determination. Moreover, Montejo’s\ntestimony came not at the suppression hearing, but rather\nonly at trial, and we are unsure whether under state law\nthat testimony came too late to affect the propriety of the\nadmission of the evidence. These matters are best left for\nresolution on remand.\n   We do reject, however, the dissent’s revisionist legal\nanalysis of the “knowing and voluntary” issue. Post, at\n10–14. In determining whether a Sixth Amendment\nwaiver was knowing and voluntary, there is no reason\ncategorically to distinguish an unrepresented defendant\nfrom a represented one. It is equally true for each that, as\nwe held in Patterson, the Miranda warnings adequately\ninform him “of his right to have counsel present during the\nquestioning,” and make him “aware of the consequences of\na decision by him to waive his Sixth Amendment rights,”\n487 U. S., at 293. Somewhat surprisingly for an opinion\nthat extols the virtues of stare decisis, the dissent com\nplains that our “treatment of the waiver question rests\nentirely on the dubious decision in Patterson,” post, at 12.\nThe Court in Patterson did not consider the result dubious,\nnor does the Court today.\n20                MONTEJO v.

See Gant, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 4) (ALITO, J., dissenting).

Rather, on its own initia\ntive and without any evidence that the longstanding Sixth\nAmendment protections established in Jackson have\ncaused any harm to the workings of the criminal justice\nsystem, the Court rejects Jackson outright on the ground\nthat it is “untenable as a theoretical and doctrinal mat\nter.” Ante, at 6. That conclusion rests on a misinterpreta\ntion of Jackson’s rationale and a gross undervaluation of\nthe rule of stare decisis. The police interrogation in this\ncase clearly violated petitioner’s Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel.\n                               I\n  The Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have\nthe Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” The right to\ncounsel attaches during “the initiation of adversary judi\ncial criminal proceedings,” Rothgery v. Gillespie County,\n554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation\n2                  MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nmarks omitted), and it guarantees the assistance of coun\nsel not only during in-court proceedings but during all\ncritical stages, including postarraignment interviews with\nlaw enforcement officers, see Patterson v. Illinois, 487\nU. S. 285, 290 (1988).\n   In Jackson, this Court considered whether the Sixth\nAmendment bars police from interrogating defendants\nwho have requested the appointment of counsel at ar\nraignment. Applying the presumption that such a request\nconstitutes an invocation of the right to counsel “at every\ncritical stage of the prosecution,” 475 U. S., at 633, we held\nthat “a defendant who has been formally charged with a\ncrime and who has requested appointment of counsel at\nhis arraignment” cannot be subject to uncounseled inter\nrogation unless he initiates “exchanges or conversations\nwith the police,” id., at 626.\n   In this case, petitioner Jesse Montejo contends that\npolice violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel by\ninterrogating him following his “72-hour hearing” outside\nthe presence of, and without prior notice to, his lawyer.\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court rejected Montejo’s claim.\nRelying on the fact that the defendants in Jackson had\n“requested” counsel at arraignment, the state court held\nthat Jackson’s protections did not apply to Montejo be\ncause his counsel was appointed automatically; Montejo\nhad not explicitly requested counsel or affirmatively ac\ncepted the counsel appointed to represent him before he\nsubmitted to police interrogation. 06–1807, pp. 28–29\n(1/16/08), 974 So. 2d 1238, 1261.\n   I agree with the majority’s conclusion that the Louisiana\nSupreme Court’s decision, if allowed to stand, “would lead\neither to an unworkable standard, or to arbitrary and\nanomalous distinctions between defendants in different\nStates,” ante, at 3. Neither option is tolerable, and neither\nis compelled by Jackson itself.\n   Our decision in Jackson involved two consolidated cases,\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nboth arising in the State of Michigan. Under Michigan\nlaw in effect at that time, when a defendant appeared for\narraignment the court was required to inform him that\ncounsel would be provided if he was financially needy and\nhe requested representation. Mich. Gen. Ct. Rule 785.4(1)\n(1976). It was undisputed that the Jackson defendants\nmade such a “request” at their arraignment: one by com\npleting an affidavit of indigency, and the other by respond\ning affirmatively to a question posed to him by the court.\nSee App. in Michigan v. Jackson, O. T. 1984, No. 84–1531,\np. 168; App. in Michigan v. Bladel, O. T. 1984, No. 84–\n1539, pp. 3a–4a. In neither case, however, was it clear\nthat counsel had actually been appointed at the arraign\nment. Thus, the defendants’ requests for counsel were\nsignificant as a matter of state law because they served as\nevidence that the appointment of counsel had been effec\ntuated even in the absence of proof that defense counsel\nhad actual notice of the appointments.\n   Unlike Michigan, Louisiana does not require a defen\ndant to make a request in order to receive court-appointed\ncounsel. Consequently, there is no reason to place consti\ntutional significance on the fact that Montejo neither\nvoiced a request for counsel nor affirmatively embraced\nthat appointment post hoc. Certainly our decision in\nJackson did not mandate such an odd rule. See ante, at 4\n(acknowledging that we had no occasion to decide in Jack\nson how its rule would apply in States that do not make\nappointment of counsel contingent on affirmative request).\nIf a defendant is entitled to protection from police-initiated\ninterrogation under the Sixth Amendment when he\nmerely requests a lawyer, he is even more obviously enti\ntled to such protection when he has secured a lawyer.\nIndeed, we have already recognized as much. See Michi\ngan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 352 (1990) (acknowledging\nthat “once a defendant obtains or even requests counsel,”\nJackson alters the waiver analysis); Patterson, 487 U.

LOUISIANA\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nat 290, n. 3 (noting “as a matter of some significance” to\nthe constitutional analysis that defendant had “not re\ntained, or accepted by appointment, a lawyer to represent\nhim at the time he was questioned by authorities” (em\nphasis added)).1 Once an attorney-client relationship has\nbeen established through the appointment or retention of\ncounsel, as a matter of federal law the method by which\nthe relationship was created is irrelevant: The existence of\na valid attorney-client relationship provides a defendant\nwith the full constitutional protection afforded by the\nSixth Amendment.\n                             II\n  Today the Court correctly concludes that the Louisiana\nSupreme Court’s holding is “troublesome,” ante, at 4,\n“impractical,” ante, at 5, and “unsound,” ante, at 6. In\nstead of reversing the decision of the state court by simply\nanswering the question on which we granted certiorari in\na unanimous opinion, however, the majority has decided to\nchange the law. Acting on its own initiative, the majority\noverrules Jackson to correct a “theoretical and doctrinal”\nproblem of its own imagining, see ante, at 6. A more\ncareful reading of Jackson and the Sixth Amendment\ncases upon which it relied reveals that the rule announced\nin Jackson protects a fundamental right that the Court\nnow dishonors.\n  The majority’s decision to overrule Jackson rests on its\nassumption that Jackson’s protective rule was intended to\n“prevent police from badgering defendants into changing\ntheir minds about their rights,” ante, at 10; see also ante,\n——————\n  1 In Patterson v. Illinois, we further explained, “[o]nce an accused has\n\na lawyer,” “a distinct set of constitutional safeguards aimed at preserv\ning the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship takes effect.” 487\nU. S., at 290, n. 3 (citing Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176 (1985)).\n“Indeed,” we emphasized, “the analysis changes markedly once an\naccused even requests the assistance of counsel.” 487 U. S., at 290, n. 3.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nat 13, just as the rule adopted in Edwards v. Arizona, 451\nU. S. 477 (1981), was designed to prevent police from\ncoercing unindicted suspects into revoking their requests\nfor counsel at interrogation. Operating on that limited\nunderstanding of the purpose behind Jackson’s protective\nrule, the Court concludes that Jackson provides no safe\nguard not already secured by this Court’s Fifth Amend\nment jurisprudence. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.\n436 (1966) (requiring defendants to be admonished of their\nright to counsel prior to custodial interrogation); Edwards,\n451 U. S. 477 (prohibiting police-initiated interrogation\nfollowing defendant’s invocation of the right to counsel).\n   The majority’s analysis flagrantly misrepresents Jack\nson’s underlying rationale and the constitutional interests\nthe decision sought to protect. While it is true that the\nrule adopted in Jackson was patterned after the rule in\nEdwards, 451 U. S., at 484–485, the Jackson opinion does\nnot even mention the anti-badgering considerations that\nprovide the basis for the Court’s decision today. Instead,\nJackson relied primarily on cases discussing the broad\nprotections guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel—not its Fifth Amendment counterpart. Jackson\nemphasized that the purpose of the Sixth Amendment is\nto “ ‘protec[t] the unaided layman at critical confrontations\nwith his adversary,’ ” 475 U. S., at 631 (quoting United\nStates v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 189 (1984)), by giving\nhim “ ‘the right to rely on counsel as a ‘medium’ between\nhim[self] and the State,’ ” 475 U. S., at 632 (quoting Maine\nv. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176 (1985)). Underscoring that\nthe commencement of criminal proceedings is a decisive\nevent that transforms a suspect into an accused within the\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment, we concluded that\narraigned defendants are entitled to “at least as much\nprotection” during interrogation as the Fifth Amendment\naffords unindicted suspects. See, e.g., 475 U. S., at 632\n(“[T]he difference between the legal basis for the rule\n6                      MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\napplied in Edwards and the Sixth Amendment claim\nasserted in these cases actually provides additional sup\nport for the application of the rule in these circumstances”\n(emphasis added)). Thus, although the rules adopted in\nEdwards and Jackson are similar, Jackson did not rely on\nthe reasoning of Edwards but remained firmly rooted in\nthe unique protections afforded to the attorney-client\nrelationship by the Sixth Amendment.2\n  Once Jackson is placed in its proper Sixth Amendment\ncontext, the majority’s justifications for overruling the\ndecision crumble. Ordinarily, this Court is hesitant to\ndisturb past precedent and will do so only when a rule has\nproven “outdated, ill-founded, unworkable, or otherwise\nlegitimately vulnerable to serious reconsideration.”\nVasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 266 (1986). While stare\ndecisis is not “an inexorable command,” we adhere to it as\n“the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded,\npredictable, and consistent development of legal princi\nples, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes\nto the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial proc\n——————\n    2 Themajority insists that protection from police badgering is the\nonly purpose the Jackson rule can plausibly serve. After all, it asks,\nfrom what other evil would the rule guard? See ante, at 9. There are\ntwo obvious answers. First, most narrowly, it protects the defendant\nfrom any police-initiated interrogation without notice to his counsel, not\njust from “badgering” which is not necessarily a part of police question\ning. Second, and of prime importance, it assures that any waiver of\ncounsel will be valid. The assistance offered by counsel protects a\ndefendant from surrendering his rights with an insufficient apprecia\ntion of what those rights are and how the decision to respond to inter\nrogation might advance or compromise his exercise of those rights\nthroughout the course of criminal proceedings. A lawyer can provide\nher client with advice regarding the legal and practical options avail\nable to him; the potential consequences, both good and bad, of choosing\nto discuss his case with police; the likely effect of such a conversation on\nthe resolution of the charges against him; and an informed assessment\nof the best course of action under the circumstances. Such assistance\ngoes far beyond mere protection against police badgering.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ness.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827–828 (1991).\n   Paying lip service to the rule of stare decisis, the major\nity acknowledges that the Court must consider many\nfactors before taking the dramatic step of overruling a\npast decision. See ante, at 12. Specifically, the majority\nfocuses on four considerations: the reasoning of the deci\nsion, the workability of the rule, the reliance interests at\nstake, and the antiquity of the precedent. The Court\nexaggerates the considerations favoring reversal, however,\nand gives short shrift to the valid considerations favoring\nretention of the Jackson rule.\n   First, and most central to the Court’s decision to over\nrule Jackson, is its assertion that Jackson’s “ ‘reason\ning’ ”—which the Court defines as “the weighing of the\n[protective] rule’s benefits against its costs,” ante, at 14—\ndoes not justify continued application of the rule it cre\nated. The balancing test the Court performs, however,\ndepends entirely on its misunderstanding of Jackson as a\nrule designed to prevent police badgering, rather than a\nrule designed to safeguard a defendant’s right to rely on\nthe assistance of counsel.3\n   Next, in order to reach the conclusion that the Jackson\n\n——————\n   3 Even accepting the majority’s improper framing of Jackson’s foun\n\ndation, the Court fails to show that the costs of the rule are more than\nnegligible or differ from any other protection afforded by the right to\ncounsel. The majority assumes, without citing any empirical or even\nanecdotal support, that any marginal benefits of the Jackson rule are\n“dwarfed by its substantial costs,” which it describes as harm to “ ‘soci\nety’s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those\nwho violate the law.’ ” Ante, at 14 (quoting Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S.\n412, 426 (1986)). That assumption is highly dubious, particularly in\nlight of the fact that several amici with interest in law enforcement\nhave conceded that the application of Jackson’s protective rule rarely\nimpedes prosecution. See Supplemental Brief for Larry D. Thompson\net al. as Amici Curiae 6 (hereinafter Thompson Supplemental Brief);\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12 (hereinafter United States\nBrief).\n8                    MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrule is unworkable, the Court reframes the relevant in\nquiry, asking not whether the Jackson rule as applied for\nthe past quarter century has proved easily administrable,\nbut instead whether the Louisiana Supreme Court’s\ncramped interpretation of that rule is practically worka\nble. The answer to that question, of course, is no. When\nframed more broadly, however, the evidence is overwhelm\ning that Jackson’s simple, bright-line rule has done more\nto advance effective law enforcement than to undermine it.\n  In a supplemental brief submitted by lawyers and\njudges with extensive experience in law enforcement and\nprosecution, amici Larry D. Thompson et al. argue per\nsuasively that Jackson’s bright-line rule has provided law\nenforcement officers with clear guidance, allowed prosecu\ntors to quickly and easily assess whether confessions will\nbe admissible in court, and assisted judges in determining\nwhether a defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights have been\nviolated by police interrogation. See generally Thompson\nSupplemental Brief 6. While amici acknowledge that\n“Jackson reduces opportunities to interrogate defendants”\nand “may require exclusion of evidence that could support\na criminal conviction,” they maintain that “it is a rare case\nwhere this rule lets a guilty defendant go free.” Ibid.\nNotably, these representations are not contradicted by the\nState of Louisiana or other amici, including the United\nStates. See United States Brief 12 (conceding that the\nJackson rule has not “resulted in the suppression of sig\nnificant numbers of statements in federal prosecutions in\nthe past”).4 In short, there is substantial evidence sug\n——————\n  4 Further supporting the workability of the Jackson rule is the fact\n\nthat it aligns with the professional standards and norms that already\ngovern the behavior of police and prosecutors.

Again as a result of its mistaken understand\ning of the purpose behind Jackson’s protective rule, the\nCourt fails to identify the real reliance interest at issue in\nthis case: the public’s interest in knowing that counsel,\nonce secured, may be reasonably relied upon as a medium\nbetween the accused and the power of the State. That\ninterest lies at the heart of the Sixth Amendment’s guar\nantee, and is surely worthy of greater consideration than\nit is given by today’s decision.\n   Finally, although the Court acknowledges that “antiq\nuity” is a factor that counsels in favor of retaining prece\ndent, it concludes that the fact Jackson is “only two dec\nades old” cuts “in favor of abandoning” the rule it\nestablished.

See United\nStates Brief 11–12; see also Thompson Supplemental Brief 13 (citing\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, Legal Handbook for Special Agents\n§7–4.1(7) (2003)).

LOUISIANA\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n23-year existence of a simple bright-line rule would be a\nfactor that cuts in the other direction.\n  Despite the fact that the rule established in Jackson\nremains relevant, well grounded in constitutional prece\ndent, and easily administrable, the Court today rejects it\nsua sponte. Such a decision can only diminish the public’s\nconfidence in the reliability and fairness of our system of\njustice.5\n                            III\n   Even if Jackson had never been decided, it would be\nclear that Montejo’s Sixth Amendment rights were vio\nlated. Today’s decision eliminates the rule that “any\nwaiver of Sixth Amendment rights given in a discussion\ninitiated by police is presumed invalid” once a defendant\nhas invoked his right to counsel. Harvey, 494 U. S., at 349\n(citing Jackson, 475 U. S., at 636). Nevertheless, under\nthe undisputed facts of this case, there is no sound basis\nfor concluding that Montejo made a knowing and valid\nwaiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel before\nacquiescing in police interrogation following his 72-hour\nhearing.    Because police questioned Montejo without\nnotice to, and outside the presence of, his lawyer, the\n——————\n  5 In his concurrence, JUSTICE ALITO assumes that my consideration of\n\nthe rule of stare decisis in this case is at odds with the Court’s recent\nrejection of his reliance on that doctrine in his dissent in Arizona v.\nGant, 556 U. S. ___ (2009). While I agree that the reasoning in his\ndissent supports my position in this case, I do not agree with his\ncharacterization of our opinion in Gant. Contrary to his representation,\nthe Court did not overrule our precedent in New York v. Belton, 453\nU. S. 454 (1981). Rather, we affirmed the narrow interpretation of\nBelton’s holding adopted by the Arizona Supreme Court, rejecting the\nbroader interpretation adopted by other lower courts that had been\nroundly criticized by judges and scholars alike. By contrast, in this\ncase the Court flatly overrules Jackson—a rule that has drawn virtu\nally no criticism—on its own initiative. The two cases are hardly\ncomparable. If they were, and if JUSTICE ALITO meant what he said in\nGant, I would expect him to join this opinion.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ninterrogation violated Montejo’s right to counsel even\nunder pre-Jackson precedent.\n   Our pre-Jackson case law makes clear that “the Sixth\nAmendment is violated when the State obtains incriminat\ning statements by knowingly circumventing the accused’s\nright to have counsel present in a confrontation between\nthe accused and a state agent.” Moulton, 474 U. S., at\n176. The Sixth Amendment entitles indicted defendants\nto have counsel notified of and present during critical\nconfrontations with the state throughout the pretrial\nprocess. Given the realities of modern criminal prosecu\ntion, the critical proceedings at which counsel’s assistance\nis required more and more often occur outside the court\nroom in pretrial proceedings “where the results might well\nsettle the accused’s fate and reduce the trial itself to a\nmere formality.” United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218,\n224 (1967).\n   In Wade, for instance, we held that because a post\nindictment lineup conducted for identification purposes is\na critical stage of the criminal proceedings, a defendant\nand his counsel are constitutionally entitled to notice of\nthe impending lineup. Accordingly, counsel’s presence is a\n“requisite to conduct of the lineup, absent an intelligent\nwaiver.” Id., at 237 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe same reasoning applies to police decisions to interro\ngate represented defendants. For if the Sixth Amendment\nentitles an accused to such robust protection during a\nlineup, surely it entitles him to such protection during a\ncustodial interrogation, when the stakes are as high or\nhigher. Cf. Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 (1959)\n(Douglas, J., concurring) (“[W]hat use is a defendant’s\nright to effective counsel at every stage of a criminal case\nif, while he is held awaiting trial, he can be questioned in\nthe absence of counsel until he confesses?”).\n   The Court avoids confronting the serious Sixth Amend\nment concerns raised by the police interrogation in this\n12                    MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncase by assuming that Montejo validly waived his Sixth\nAmendment rights before submitting to interrogation.6 It\ndoes so by summarily concluding that “doctrines ensuring\nvoluntariness of the Fifth Amendment waiver simultane\nously ensure the voluntariness of the Sixth Amendment\nwaiver,” ante, at 15–16; thus, because Montejo was given\nMiranda warnings prior to interrogation, his waiver was\npresumptively valid. Ironically, while the Court faults\nJackson for blurring the line between this Court’s Fifth\nand Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, it commits the same\nerror by assuming that the Miranda warnings given in\nthis case, designed purely to safeguard the Fifth Amend\nment right against self-incrimination, were somehow\nadequate to protect Montejo’s more robust Sixth Amend\nment right to counsel.\n    The majority’s cursory treatment of the waiver question\nrests entirely on the dubious decision in Patterson, in\nwhich we addressed whether, by providing Miranda warn\nings, police had adequately advised an indicted but unrep\nresented defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to coun\nsel. The majority held that “[a]s a general matter . . . an\naccused who is admonished with the warnings prescribed\n. . . in Miranda, . . . has been sufficiently apprised of the\nnature of his Sixth Amendment rights, and of the conse\nquences of abandoning those rights.” 487 U. S., at 296.\nThe Court recognized, however, that “because the Sixth\nAmendment’s protection of the attorney-client relationship\n\n——————\n  6 The majority leaves open the possibility that, on remand, Montejo\n\nmay argue that his waiver was invalid because police falsely told him\nhe had not been appointed counsel. See ante, at 18. While such police\ndeception would obviously invalidate any otherwise valid waiver of\nMontejo’s Sixth Amendment rights, Montejo has a strong argument\nthat, given his status as a represented criminal defendant, the Miranda\nwarnings given to him by police were insufficient to permit him to\nmake a knowing waiver of his Sixth Amendment rights even absent\npolice deception.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  13\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n. . . extends beyond Miranda’s protection of the Fifth\nAmendment right to counsel, . . . there will be cases where\na waiver which would be valid under Miranda will not\nsuffice for Sixth Amendment purposes.” Id., at 297, n. 9.\nThis is such a case.\n    As I observed in Patterson, the conclusion that Miranda\nwarnings ordinarily provide a sufficient basis for a know\ning waiver of the right to counsel rests on the questionable\nassumption that those warnings make clear to defendants\nthe assistance a lawyer can render during post-indictment\ninterrogation. See 487 U. S., at 307 (dissenting opinion).\nBecause Miranda warnings do not hint at the ways in\nwhich a lawyer might assist her client during conversa\ntions with the police, I remain convinced that the warn\nings prescribed in Miranda,7 while sufficient to apprise a\ndefendant of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,\nare inadequate to inform an unrepresented, indicted de\nfendant of his Sixth Amendment right to have a lawyer\npresent at all critical stages of a criminal prosecution. The\ninadequacy of those warnings is even more obvious in the\ncase of a represented defendant. While it can be argued\nthat informing an indicted but unrepresented defendant of\nhis right to counsel at least alerts him to the fact that he is\nentitled to obtain something he does not already possess,\nproviding that same warning to a defendant who has\nalready secured counsel is more likely to confound than\nenlighten.8 By glibly assuming that that the Miranda\n——————\n  7 Under Miranda, a suspect must be “warned prior to any questioning\n\nthat he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says may be\nused against him in court of law, that he has the right to the presence\nof any attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney, one will be\nappointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.” 384 U. S.,\nat 479.\n  8 With respect to vulnerable defendants, such as juveniles and those\n\nwith mental impairments of various kinds, amici National Association\nof Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. assert that “[o]verruling Jackson\nwould be particularly detrimental . . . because of the confusing instruc\n14                    MONTEJO v. LOUISIANA\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nwarnings given in this case were sufficient to ensure\nMontejo’s waiver was both knowing and voluntary, the\nCourt conveniently avoids any comment on the actual\nadvice Montejo received, which did not adequately inform\nhim of his relevant Sixth Amendment rights or alert him\nto the possible consequences of waiving those rights.\n  A defendant’s decision to forgo counsel’s assistance and\nspeak openly with police is a momentous one. Given the\nhigh stakes of making such a choice and the potential\nvalue of counsel’s advice and mediation at that critical\nstage of the criminal proceedings, it is imperative that a\ndefendant possess “a full awareness of both the nature of\nthe right being abandoned and the consequences of the\ndecision to abandon it,” Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412,\n421 (1986), before his waiver is deemed valid. See Iowa v.\nTovar, 541 U. S. 77, 81 (2004); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458, 464 (1938). Because the administration of\nMiranda warnings was insufficient to ensure Montejo\nunderstood the Sixth Amendment right he was being\nasked to surrender, the record in this case provides no\nbasis for concluding that Montejo validly waived his right\nto counsel, even in the absence of Jackson’s enhanced\nprotections.\n                            IV\n  The Court’s decision to overrule Jackson is unwar\nranted. Not only does it rests on a flawed doctrinal prem\n——————\ntions regarding counsel that they would receive. At the initial hearing,\nthey would likely learn that an attorney was being appointed for them,\nIn a later custodial interrogation, however, they would be informed in\nthe traditional manner of ‘their right to counsel’ and right to have\ncounsel ‘appointed’ if they are indigent, notwithstanding that counsel\nhad already been appointed in open court. These conflicting statements\nwould be confusing to anyone, but would be especially baffling to\ndefendants with mental disabilities or other impairments.” Supple\nmental Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers\net al. as Amici Curiae 7–8.\n                Cite as: 556 U.
