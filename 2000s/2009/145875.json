Loeb, Sarang Vijay Damle, Washington, D.C., for Petitioners.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondent Javaid Iqbal is a citizen of Pakistan and a Muslim. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on criminal charges and detained by federal officials. Respondent claims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while in federal custody. To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent filed a complaint against numerous federal officials, including John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States, and Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in the case now before us. As to these two petitioners, the complaint alleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected respondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>In the District Court petitioners raised the defense of qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit, contending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim against them. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite petitioners' official status at the times in question. Petitioners brought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court, without discussion, assumed it had jurisdiction over the order denying the motion to dismiss; and it affirmed the District Court's decision.</p>\n<p>Respondent's account of his prison ordeal could, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some governmental actors. But the allegations and pleadings with respect to these actors are not before us here. This case instead turns on a narrower question: Did respondent, as the plaintiff in the District Court, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1943</span> plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states a claim that petitioners deprived him of his clearly established constitutional rights. We hold respondent's pleadings are insufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Following the 2001 attacks, the FBI and other entities within the Department of Justice began an investigation of vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent them from attacking anew. The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special agents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor. By September 18 \"the FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from the public.\" Dept. of Justice, Office of Inspector General, The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks 1, 11-12 (Apr.2003) (hereinafter OIG Report), http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/ 0306/ full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0 &amp; bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf (as visited May 14, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>In the ensuing months the FBI questioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the attacks in particular or to terrorism in general. <i>Id.,</i> at 1. Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges; and a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be \"of `high interest'\" to the investigation. <i>Id.,</i> at 111. The high-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions designed to prevent them from communicating with the general prison population or the outside world. <i>Id.,</i> at 112-113.</p>\n<p>Respondent was one of the detainees. According to his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of fraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to defraud the United States. <i>Iqbal v. Hasty,</i> 490 F.3d 143, 147-148 (C.A.2 2007). Pending trial for those crimes, respondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York. Respondent was designated a person \"of high interest\" to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was placed in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU). <i>Id.,</i> at 148. As the facility's name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum security conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison regulations. <i>Ibid.</i> ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in lockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their cells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer escort. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, served a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his native Pakistan. <i>Id.,</i> at 149. He then filed a <i>Bivens</i> action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against 34 current and former federal officials and 19 \"John Doe\" federal corrections officers. See <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). The defendants range from the correctional officers who had day-to-day contact with respondent during the term of his confinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way to petitioners\u0097officials who were at the highest level of the federal law enforcement hierarchy. First Amended Complaint in No. 04-CV-1809 (JG)(JA), \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (hereinafter Complaint).</p>\n<p>The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not challenge respondent's arrest or his confinement in the MDC's general prison population. Rather, it concentrates on his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1944</span> treatment while confined to the ADMAX SHU. The complaint sets forth various claims against defendants who are not before us. For instance, the complaint alleges that respondent's jailors \"kicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across\" his cell without justification, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a; subjected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when he posed no safety risk to himself or others, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 143-145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and other Muslims pray because there would be \"[n]o prayers for terrorists,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a.</p>\n<p>The allegations against petitioners are the only ones relevant here. The complaint contends that petitioners designated respondent a person of high interest on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. The complaint alleges that \"the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 47, at 164a. It further alleges that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 69, at 168a. Lastly, the complaint posits that petitioners \"each knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" respondent to harsh conditions of confinement \"as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a-173a. The pleading names Ashcroft as the \"principal architect\" of the policy, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 10, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as \"instrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 11, at 157a.</p>\n<p>Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state sufficient allegations to show their own involvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct. The District Court denied their motion. Accepting all of the allegations in respondent's complaint as true, the court held that \"it cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which [respondent] would be entitled to relief as against\" petitioners. <i>Id.,</i> at 136a-137a (relying on <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). Invoking the collateral-order doctrine petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While that appeal was pending, this Court decided <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), which discussed the standard for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals considered <i>Twombly'</i>s applicability to this case. Acknowledging that <i>Twombly</i> retired the <i>Conley</i> no-set-of-facts test relied upon by the District Court, the Court of Appeals' opinion discussed at length how to apply this Court's \"standard for assessing the adequacy of pleadings.\" 490 F.3d, at 155. It concluded that <i>Twombly</i> called for a \"flexible `plausibility standard,' which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to render the claim <i>plausible.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 157-158. The court found that petitioners' appeal did not present one of \"those contexts\" requiring amplification. As a consequence, it held respondent's pleading adequate to allege petitioners' personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law. <i>Id.,</i> at 174.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1945</span> Judge Cabranes concurred. He agreed that the majority's \"discussion of the relevant pleading standards reflect[ed] the uneasy compromise . . . between a qualified immunity privilege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of government as contemplated by our constitutional structure and the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 178 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Judge Cabranes nonetheless expressed concern at the prospect of subjecting high-ranking Government officials\u0097entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity and charged with responding to \"a national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic\"\u0097to the burdens of discovery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific as respondent's. <i>Id.,</i> at 179. Reluctant to vindicate that concern as a member of the Court of Appeals, <i>ibid.,</i> Judge Cabranes urged this Court to address the appropriate pleading standard \"at the earliest opportunity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 178. We granted certiorari, 554 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2931, 171 L.Ed.2d 863 (2008), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We first address whether the Court of Appeals had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss. Respondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue. We are not free to pretermit the question. Subjectmatter jurisdiction cannot be forfeited or waived and should be considered when fairly in doubt. <i>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> 546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006) (citing <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)). According to respondent, the District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss is not appealable under the collateral-order doctrine. We disagree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>With exceptions inapplicable here, Congress has vested the courts of appeals with \"jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Though the statute's finality requirement ensures that \"interlocutory appeals\u0097appeals before the end of district court proceedings\u0097are the exception, not the rule,\" <i>Johnson v. Jones,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 309, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995), it does not prevent \"review of all prejudgment orders.\" <i>Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 305, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996). Under the collateral-order doctrine a limited set of district-court orders are reviewable \"though short of final judgment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The orders within this narrow category \"are immediately appealable because they `finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,</i> 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949)).</p>\n<p>A district-court decision denying a Government officer's claim of qualified immunity can fall within the narrow class of appealable orders despite \"the absence of a final judgment.\" <i>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). This is so because qualified immunity\u0097which shields Government officials \"from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights,\" <i>Harlow v. Fitzgerald,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1946</span> 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)\u0097is both a defense to liability and a limited \"entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.\" <i>Mitchell, supra,</i> 472 U.S., at 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806. Provided it \"turns on an issue of law,\" <i>id.,</i> at 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, a district-court order denying qualified immunity \"`conclusively determine[s]'\" that the defendant must bear the burdens of discovery; is \"conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff's claim\"; and would prove \"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527-528 (citing <i>Cohen, supra,</i> at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221). As a general matter, the collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the criteria set out in <i>Cohen.</i> But the applicability of the doctrine in the context of qualified-immunity claims is well established; and this Court has been careful to say that a district court's order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a \"final decision\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1291. <i>Behrens,</i> 516 U.S., at 307, 116 S.Ct. 834.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Applying these principles, we conclude that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear petitioners' appeal. The District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and rejected the defense of qualified immunity. It was therefore a final decision \"subject to immediate appeal.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Respondent says that \"a qualified immunity appeal based solely on the complaint's failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate issues relevant to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a proper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.\" Brief for Respondent Iqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief). In other words, respondent contends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether his complaint avers a clearly established constitutional violation but that it lacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his pleadings. Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate jurisdiction is not so strictly confined.</p>\n<p>In <i>Hartman v. Moore,</i> 547 U.S. 250, 126 S.Ct. 1695, 164 L.Ed.2d 441 (2006), the Court reviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified immunity. The legal issue decided in <i>Hartman</i> concerned the elements a plaintiff \"must plead and prove in order to win\" a First Amendment retaliation claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 257, n. 5, 126 S.Ct. 1695. Similarly, two Terms ago in <i>Wilkie v. Robbins,</i> 551 U.S. 537, 127 S.Ct. 2588, 168 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007), the Court considered another interlocutory order denying qualified immunity. The legal issue there was whether a <i>Bivens</i> action can be employed to challenge interference with property rights. 551 U.S., at 549, n. 4, 127 S.Ct. 2588. These cases cannot be squared with respondent's argument that the collateralorder doctrine restricts appellate jurisdiction to the \"ultimate issu[e]\" whether the legal wrong asserted was a violation of clearly established law while excluding the question whether the facts pleaded establish such a violation. Iqbal Brief 15. Indeed, the latter question is even more clearly within the category of appealable decisions than the questions presented in <i>Hartman</i> and <i>Wilkie,</i> since whether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded. In that sense the sufficiency of respondent's pleadings is both \"inextricably intertwined with,\" <i>Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> 514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995), and \"directly implicated by,\" <i>Hartman, supra,</i> at 257, n. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1947</span> 5, 126 S.Ct. 1695, the qualified immunity defense.</p>\n<p>Respondent counters that our holding in <i>Johnson,</i> 515 U.S. 304, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238, confirms the want of subjectmatter jurisdiction here. That is incorrect. The allegation in <i>Johnson</i> was that five defendants, all of them police officers, unlawfully beat the plaintiff. <i>Johnson</i> considered \"the appealability of a portion of\" the District Court's summary judgment order that, \"though entered in a `qualified immunity' case, determine[d] only\" that there was a genuine issue of material fact that three of the defendants participated in the beating. <i>Id.,</i> at 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p>In finding that order not a \"final decision\" for purposes of \u00a7 1291, the <i>Johnson</i> Court cited <i>Mitchell</i> for the proposition that only decisions turning \"`<i>on an issue of law'\"</i> are subject to immediate appeal. 515 U.S., at 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151. Though determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits near the law-fact divide. Or as we said in <i>Johnson,</i> it is a \"factrelated\" legal inquiry. <i>Id.,</i> at 314, 115 S.Ct. 2151. To conduct it, a court of appeals may be required to consult a \"vast pretrial record, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. That process generally involves matters more within a district court's ken and may replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal following final judgment. <i>Ibid.</i> Finding those concerns predominant, <i>Johnson</i> held that the collateral orders that are \"final\" under <i>Mitchell</i> turn on \"abstract,\" rather than \"fact-based,\" issues of law. 515 U.S., at 317, 115 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p>The concerns that animated the decision in <i>Johnson</i> are absent when an appellate court considers the disposition of a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings. True, the categories of \"factbased\" and \"abstract\" legal questions used to guide the Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i> are not well defined. Here, however, the order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss falls well within the latter class. Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals considered only the allegations contained within the four corners of respondent's complaint; resort to a \"vast pretrial record\" on petitioners' motion to dismiss was unnecessary. <i>Id.,</i> at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. And determining whether respondent's complaint has the \"heft\" to state a claim is a task well within an appellate court's core competency. <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint is not a \"fact-based\" question of law, so the problem the Court sought to avoid in <i>Johnson</i> is not implicated here. The District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine over which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has, jurisdiction. We proceed to consider the merits of petitioners' appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 553-554, 127 S.Ct. 1955, the Court found it necessary first to discuss the antitrust principles implicated by the complaint. Here too we begin by taking note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bivens</i>\u0097proceeding on the theory that a right suggests a remedy\u0097this Court \"recognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen's constitutional rights.\" <i>Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko,</i> 534 U.S. 61, 66, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1948</span> (2001). Because implied causes of action are disfavored, the Court has been reluctant to extend <i>Bivens</i> liability \"to any new context or new category of defendants.\" 534 U.S., at 68, 122 S.Ct. 515. See also <i>Wilkie,</i> 551 U.S., at 549-550, 127 S.Ct. 2588. That reluctance might well have disposed of respondent's First Amendment claim of religious discrimination. For while we have allowed a <i>Bivens</i> action to redress a violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, see <i>Davis v. Passman,</i> 442 U.S. 228, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979), we have not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise Clause. Indeed, we have declined to extend <i>Bivens</i> to a claim sounding in the First Amendment. <i>Bush v. Lucas,</i> 462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983). Petitioners do not press this argument, however, so we assume, without deciding, that respondent's First Amendment claim is actionable under <i>Bivens.</i></p>\n<p>In the limited settings where <i>Bivens</i> does apply, the implied cause of action is the \"federal analog to suits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\" <i>Hartman,</i> 547 U.S., at 254, n. 2, 126 S.Ct. 1695. Cf. <i>Wilson v. Layne,</i> 526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999). Based on the rules our precedents establish, respondent correctly concedes that Government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of <i>respondeat superior.</i> Iqbal Brief 46 (\"[I]t is undisputed that supervisory <i>Bivens</i> liability cannot be established solely on a theory of <i>respondeat superior</i>\"). See <i>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (finding no vicarious liability for a municipal \"person\" under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983); see also <i>Dunlop v. Munroe,</i> 7 Cranch 242, 269, 3 L.Ed. 329 (1812) (a federal official's liability \"will only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge\" of his subordinates' duties); <i>Robertson v. Sichel,</i> 127 U.S. 507, 515-516, 8 S.Ct. 1286, 3 L.Ed. 203 (1888) (\"A public officer or agent is not responsible for the misfeasances or position wrongs, or for the nonfeasances, or negligences, or omissions of duty, of the subagents or servants or other persons properly employed by or under him, in the discharge of his official duties\"). Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to <i>Bivens</i> and \u00a7 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Governmentofficial defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The factors necessary to establish a <i>Bivens</i> violation will vary with the constitutional provision at issue. Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose. <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,</i> 508 U.S. 520, 540-541, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993) (First Amendment); <i>Washington v. Davis,</i> 426 U.S. 229, 240, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than \"intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.\" <i>Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney,</i> 442 U.S. 256, 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979). It instead involves a decisionmaker's undertaking a course of action \"`because of,' not merely `in spite of,' [the action's] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead sufficient factual matter to show that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1949</span> petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>Respondent disagrees. He argues that, under a theory of \"supervisory liability,\" petitioners can be liable for \"knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates' use of discriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among detainees.\" Iqbal Brief 45-46. That is to say, respondent believes a supervisor's mere knowledge of his subordinate's discriminatory purpose amounts to the supervisor's violating the Constitution. We reject this argument. Respondent's conception of \"supervisory liability\" is inconsistent with his accurate stipulation that petitioners may not be held accountable for the misdeeds of their agents. In a \u00a7 1983 suit or a <i>Bivens</i> action\u0097where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants\u0097the term \"supervisory liability\" is a misnomer. Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct. In the context of determining whether there is a violation of clearly established right to overcome qualified immunity, purpose rather than knowledge is required to impose <i>Bivens</i> liability on the subordinate for unconstitutional discrimination; the same holds true for an official charged with violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We turn to respondent's complaint. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" As the Court held in <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require \"detailed factual allegations,\" but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. <i>Id.,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (citing <i>Papasan v. Allain,</i> 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)). A pleading that offers \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\" 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \"naked assertion[s]\" devoid of \"further factual enhancement.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. <i>Id.,</i> at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The plausibility standard is not akin to a \"probability requirement,\" but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. <i>Ibid.</i> Where a complaint pleads facts that are \"merely consistent with\" a defendant's liability, it \"stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p>Two working principles underlie our decision in <i>Twombly.</i> First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. <i>Id.,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (Although for the purposes of a motion to dismiss we must take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1950</span> \"are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions. Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. <i>Id.,</i> at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. 490 F.3d, at 157-158. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged\u0097but it has not \"show[n]\"\u0097\"that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p>In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> illustrates the two-pronged approach. There, we considered the sufficiency of a complaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications providers had entered an agreement not to compete and to forestall competitive entry, in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. Recognizing that \u00a7 1 enjoins only anticompetitive conduct \"effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy,\" <i>Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.,</i> 467 U.S. 752, 775, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984), the plaintiffs in <i>Twombly</i> flatly pleaded that the defendants \"ha[d] entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry. . . and ha[d] agreed not to compete with one another.\" 550 U.S., at 551, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (internal quotation marks omitted). The complaint also alleged that the defendants' \"parallel course of conduct . . . to prevent competition\" and inflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement alleged. <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The Court held the plaintiffs' complaint deficient under Rule 8. In doing so it first noted that the plaintiffs' assertion of an unlawful agreement was a \"`legal conclusion'\" and, as such, was not entitled to the assumption of truth. <i>Id.,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Had the Court simply credited the allegation of a conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce. The Court next addressed the \"nub\" of the plaintiffs' complaint\u0097the well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel behavior\u0097to determine whether it gave rise to a \"plausible suggestion of conspiracy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 565-566, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Acknowledging that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agreement, the Court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compatible with, but indeed was more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market behavior. <i>Id.,</i> at 567, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Because the well-pleaded fact of parallel conduct, accepted as true, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement, the Court held the plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed. <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Under <i>Twombly</i>'s construction of Rule 8, we conclude that respondent's complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1951</span> has not \"nudged [his] claims\" of invidious discrimination \"across the line from conceivable to plausible.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth. Respondent pleads that petitioners \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]\" to harsh conditions of confinement \"as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" Complaint \u00b6 96, App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a-174a. The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was the \"principal architect\" of this invidious policy, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 10, at 157a, and that Mueller was \"instrumental\" in adopting and executing it, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 11, at 157a. These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly,</i> amount to nothing more than a \"formulaic recitation of the elements\" of a constitutional discrimination claim, 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, namely, that petitioners adopted a policy \"`because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" <i>Feeney,</i> 442 U.S., at 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282. As such, the allegations are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. <i>Twombly, supra,</i> 550 U.S., at 554-555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical. We do not so characterize them any more than the Court in <i>Twombly</i> rejected the plaintiffs' express allegation of a \"`contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 551, 127 S.Ct. 1955, because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained. It is the conclusory nature of respondent's allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.</p>\n<p>We next consider the factual allegations in respondent's complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief. The complaint alleges that \"the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\" Complaint \u00b6 47, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a. It further claims that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 69, at 168a. Taken as true, these allegations are consistent with petitioners' purposefully designating detainees \"of high interest\" because of their race, religion, or national origin. But given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.</p>\n<p>The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who counted themselves members in good standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist group. Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim\u0097Osama bin Laden\u0097and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples. It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims. On the facts respondent alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United States and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist acts. As between that \"obvious alternative explanation\" for the arrests, <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 567, 127 S.Ct. 1955, and the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1952</span> asks us to infer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.</p>\n<p>But even if the complaint's well-pleaded facts give rise to a plausible inference that respondent's arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle respondent to relief. It is important to recall that respondent's complaint challenges neither the constitutionality of his arrest nor his initial detention in the MDC. Respondent's constitutional claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible \"policy of holding post-September-11th detainees\" in the ADMAX SHU once they were categorized as \"of high interest.\" Complaint \u00b6 69, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a. To prevail on that theory, the complaint must contain facts plausibly showing that petitioners purposefully adopted a policy of classifying post-September-11 detainees as \"of high interest\" because of their race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>This the complaint fails to do. Though respondent alleges that various other defendants, who are not before us, may have labeled him a person of \"of high interest\" for impermissible reasons, his only factual allegation against petitioners accuses them of adopting a policy approving \"restrictive conditions of confinement\" for post-September-11 detainees until they were \"`cleared' by the FBI.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Accepting the truth of that allegation, the complaint does not show, or even intimate, that petitioners purposefully housed detainees in the ADMAX SHU due to their race, religion, or national origin. All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation's top law enforcement officers, in the aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack, sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity. Respondent does not argue, nor can he, that such a motive would violate petitioners' constitutional obligations. He would need to allege more by way of factual content to \"nudg[e]\" his claim of purposeful discrimination \"across the line from conceivable to plausible.\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>To be sure, respondent can attempt to draw certain contrasts between the pleadings the Court considered in <i>Twombly</i> and the pleadings at issue here. In <i>Twombly,</i> the complaint alleged general wrongdoing that extended over a period of years, <i>id.,</i> at 551, 127 S.Ct. 1955, whereas here the complaint alleges discrete wrongs\u0097for instance, beatings\u0097by lower level Government actors. The allegations here, if true, and if condoned by petitioners, could be the basis for some inference of wrongful intent on petitioners' part. Despite these distinctions, respondent's pleadings do not suffice to state a claim. Unlike in <i>Twombly,</i> where the doctrine of <i>respondeat superior</i> could bind the corporate defendant, here, as we have noted, petitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic. Yet respondent's complaint does not contain any factual allegation sufficient to plausibly suggest petitioners' discriminatory state of mind. His pleadings thus do not meet the standard necessary to comply with Rule 8.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that we express no opinion concerning the sufficiency of respondent's complaint against the defendants who are not before us. Respondent's account of his prison ordeal alleges serious official misconduct that we need not address here. Our decision is limited to the determination that respondent's complaint does not entitle him to relief from petitioners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent offers three arguments that bear on our disposition of his case, but none is persuasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1953</span> 1</h2>\n<p>Respondent first says that our decision in <i>Twombly</i> should be limited to pleadings made in the context of an antitrust dispute. Iqbal Brief 37-38. This argument is not supported by <i>Twombly</i> and is incompatible with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Though <i>Twombly</i> determined the sufficiency of a complaint sounding in antitrust, the decision was based on our interpretation and application of Rule 8. 550 U.S., at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955. That Rule in turn governs the pleading standard \"in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> expounded the pleading standard for \"all civil actions,\" <i>ibid.,</i> and it applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike. See 550 U.S., at 555-556, and n. 3, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Respondent next implies that our construction of Rule 8 should be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals has \"instructed the district court to cabin discovery in such a way as to preserve\" petitioners' defense of qualified immunity \"as much as possible in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.\" Iqbal Brief 27. We have held, however, that the question presented by a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed upon the discovery process. <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 559, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (\"It is no answer to say that a claim just shy of a plausible entitlement to relief can, if groundless, be weeded out early in the discovery process through careful case management given the common lament that the success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse has been on the modest side\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>Our rejection of the careful-case-management approach is especially important in suits where Government-official defendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity. The basic thrust of the qualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including \"avoidance of disruptive discovery.\" <i>Siegert v. Gilley,</i> 500 U.S. 226, 236, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). There are serious and legitimate reasons for this. If a Government official is to devote time to his or her duties, and to the formulation of sound and responsible policies, it is counterproductive to require the substantial diversion that is attendant to participating in litigation and making informed decisions as to how it should proceed. Litigation, though necessary to ensure that officials comply with the law, exacts heavy costs in terms of efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and resources that might otherwise be directed to the proper execution of the work of the Government. The costs of diversion are only magnified when Government officials are charged with responding to, as Judge Cabranes aptly put it, \"a national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic.\" 490 F.3d, at 179.</p>\n<p>It is no answer to these concerns to say that discovery for petitioners can be deferred while pretrial proceedings continue for other defendants. It is quite likely that, when discovery as to the other parties proceeds, it would prove necessary for petitioners and their counsel to participate in the process to ensure the case does not develop in a misleading or slanted way that causes prejudice to their position. Even if petitioners are not yet themselves subject to discovery orders, then, they would not be free from the burdens of discovery.</p>\n<p>We decline respondent's invitation to relax the pleading requirements on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1954</span> ground that the Court of Appeals promises petitioners minimally intrusive discovery. That promise provides especially cold comfort in this pleading context, where we are impelled to give real content to the concept of qualified immunity for high-level officials who must be neither deterred nor detracted from the vigorous performance of their duties. Because respondent's complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Respondent finally maintains that the Federal Rules expressly allow him to allege petitioners' discriminatory intent \"generally,\" which he equates with a conclusory allegation. Iqbal Brief 32 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9). It follows, respondent says, that his complaint is sufficiently well pleaded because it claims that petitioners discriminated against him \"on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" Complaint \u00b6 96, App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a-173a. Were we required to accept this allegation as true, respondent's complaint would survive petitioners' motion to dismiss. But the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint's conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.</p>\n<p>It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading \"fraud or mistake,\" while allowing \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind [to] be alleged generally.\" But \"generally\" is a relative term. In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake. Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license to evade the less rigid\u0097though still operative\u0097strictures of Rule 8. See 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1301, p. 291 (3d ed. 2004) (\"[A] rigid rule requiring the detailed pleading of a condition of mind would be undesirable because, absent overriding considerations pressing for a specificity requirement, as in the case of averments of fraud or mistake, the general `short and plain statement of the claim' mandate in Rule 8(a). . . should control the second sentence of Rule 9(b)\"). And Rule 8 does not empower respondent to plead the bare elements of his cause of action, affix the label \"general allegation,\" and expect his complaint to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>We hold that respondent's complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful discrimination against petitioners. The Court of Appeals should decide in the first instance whether to remand to the District Court so that respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient complaint.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case is here on the uncontested assumption that <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), allows personal liability based on a federal officer's violation of an individual's rights under the First and Fifth Amendments, and it comes to us with the explicit concession of petitioners Ashcroft and Mueller that an officer may be subject to <i>Bivens</i> liability as a supervisor on grounds other than <i>respondeat</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1955</span> <i>superior.</i> The Court apparently rejects this concession and, although it has no bearing on the majority's resolution of this case, does away with supervisory liability under <i>Bivens.</i> The majority then misapplies the pleading standard under <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), to conclude that the complaint fails to state a claim. I respectfully dissent from both the rejection of supervisory liability as a cognizable claim in the face of petitioners' concession, and from the holding that the complaint fails to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondent Iqbal was arrested in November 2001 on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and fraud in relation to identification documents, and was placed in pretrial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. <i>Iqbal v. Hasty,</i> 490 F.3d 143, 147-148 (C.A.2 2007). He alleges that FBI officials carried out a discriminatory policy by designating him as a person \"`of high interest'\" in the investigation of the September 11 attacks solely because of his race, religion, or national origin. Owing to this designation he was placed in the detention center's Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit for over six months while awaiting the fraud trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 148. As I will mention more fully below, Iqbal contends that Ashcroft and Mueller were at the very least aware of the discriminatory detention policy and condoned it (and perhaps even took part in devising it), thereby violating his First and Fifth Amendment rights.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Iqbal claims that on the day he was transferred to the special unit, prison guards, without provocation, \"picked him up and threw him against the wall, kicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across the room.\" First Amended Complaint in No. 04-CV-1809 (JG)(JA), \u00b6 113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a (hereinafter Complaint). He says that after being attacked a second time he sought medical attention but was denied care for two weeks. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 187-188, at 189a. According to Iqbal's complaint, prison staff in the special unit subjected him to unjustified strip and body cavity searches, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 136-140, at 181a, verbally berated him as a \"`terrorist'\" and \"`Muslim killer,'\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 87, at 170a-171a, refused to give him adequate food, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 91, at 171a-172a, and intentionally turned on air conditioning during the winter and heating during the summer, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 84, at 170a. He claims that prison staff interfered with his attempts to pray and engage in religious study, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 153-154, at 183a-184a, and with his access to counsel, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 168, 171, at 186a-187a.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied Ashcroft and Mueller's motion to dismiss Iqbal's discrimination claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Ashcroft and Mueller then asked this Court to grant certiorari on two questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"1. Whether a conclusory allegation that a cabinet-level officer or other highranking official knew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts purportedly committed by subordinate officials is sufficient to state individual-capacity claims against those officials under <i>Bivens.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1956</span> \"2. Whether a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official may be held personally liable for the allegedly unconstitutional acts of subordinate officials on the ground that, as high-level supervisors, they had constructive notice of the discrimination allegedly carried out by such subordinate officials.\" Pet. for Cert. I.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court granted certiorari on both questions. The first is about pleading; the second goes to the liability standard.</p>\n<p>In the first question, Ashcroft and Mueller did not ask whether \"a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official\" who \"knew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts committed by subordinate officials\" was subject to liability under <i>Bivens.</i> In fact, they conceded in their petition for certiorari that they would be liable if they had \"actual knowledge\" of discrimination by their subordinates and exhibited \"`deliberate indifference'\" to that discrimination. Pet. for Cert. 29 (quoting <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). Instead, they asked the Court to address whether Iqbal's allegations against them (which they call conclusory) were sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2), and in particular whether the Court of Appeals misapplied our decision in <i>Twombly</i> construing that rule. Pet. for Cert. 11-24.</p>\n<p>In the second question, Ashcroft and Mueller asked this Court to say whether they could be held personally liable for the actions of their subordinates based on the theory that they had constructive notice of their subordinates' unconstitutional conduct. <i>Id.,</i> at 25-33. This was an odd question to pose, since Iqbal has never claimed that Ashcroft and Mueller are liable on a constructive notice theory. Be that as it may, the second question challenged only one possible ground for imposing supervisory liability under <i>Bivens.</i> In sum, both questions assumed that a defendant could raise a <i>Bivens</i> claim on theories of supervisory liability other than constructive notice, and neither question asked the parties or the Court to address the elements of such liability.</p>\n<p>The briefing at the merits stage was no different. Ashcroft and Mueller argued that the factual allegations in Iqbal's complaint were insufficient to overcome their claim of qualified immunity; they also contended that they could not be held liable on a theory of constructive notice. Again they conceded, however, that they would be subject to supervisory liability if they \"had actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being `of high interest' and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\" Brief for Petitioners 50; see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 21-22. Iqbal argued that the allegations in his complaint were sufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) and <i>Twombly,</i> and conceded that as a matter of law he could not recover under a theory of <i>respondeat superior.</i> See Brief for Respondent Iqbal 46. Thus, the parties agreed as to a proper standard of supervisory liability, and the disputed question was whether Iqbal's complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Without acknowledging the parties' agreement as to the standard of supervisory liability, the Court asserts that it must <i>sua sponte</i> decide the scope of supervisory liability here. <i>Ante,</i> at 1947-1949. I agree that, absent Ashcroft and Mueller's concession, that determination would have to be made; without knowing the elements of a supervisory liability claim, there would be no way to determine whether a plaintiff had made factual allegations amounting to grounds for relief on that claim. See <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 557-558, 127 S.Ct. 1955. But deciding the scope of supervisory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1957</span> <i>Bivens</i> liability in this case is uncalled for. There are several reasons, starting with the position Ashcroft and Mueller have taken and following from it.</p>\n<p>First, Ashcroft and Mueller have, as noted, made the critical concession that a supervisor's knowledge of a subordinate's unconstitutional conduct and deliberate indifference to that conduct are grounds for <i>Bivens</i> liability. Iqbal seeks to recover on a theory that Ashcroft and Mueller at least knowingly acquiesced (and maybe more than acquiesced) in the discriminatory acts of their subordinates; if he can show this, he will satisfy Ashcroft and Mueller's own test for supervisory liability. See <i>Farmer, supra,</i> at 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (explaining that a prison official acts with \"deliberate indifference\" if \"the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm\"). We do not normally override a party's concession, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. International Business Machines Corp.,</i> 517 U.S. 843, 855, 116 S.Ct. 1793, 135 L.Ed.2d 124 (1996) (holding that \"[i]t would be inappropriate for us to [e]xamine in this case, without the benefit of the parties' briefing,\" an issue the Government had conceded), and doing so is especially inappropriate when, as here, the issue is unnecessary to decide the case, see <i>infra,</i> at 1958-1959. I would therefore accept Ashcroft and Mueller's concession for purposes of this case and proceed to consider whether the complaint alleges at least knowledge and deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p>Second, because of the concession, we have received no briefing or argument on the proper scope of supervisory liability, much less the full-dress argument we normally require. <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> 367 U.S. 643, 676-677, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). We consequently are in no position to decide the precise contours of supervisory liability here, this issue being a complicated one that has divided the Courts of Appeals. See <i>infra,</i> at 1957-1959. This Court recently remarked on the danger of \"bad decisionmaking\" when the briefing on a question is \"woefully inadequate,\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 819, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009), yet today the majority answers a question with no briefing at all. The attendant risk of error is palpable.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court's approach is most unfair to Iqbal. He was entitled to rely on Ashcroft and Mueller's concession, both in their petition for certiorari and in their merits briefs, that they could be held liable on a theory of knowledge and deliberate indifference. By overriding that concession, the Court denies Iqbal a fair chance to be heard on the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority, however, does ignore the concession. According to the majority, because Iqbal concededly cannot recover on a theory of <i>respondeat superior,</i> it follows that he cannot recover under any theory of supervisory liability. <i>Ante,</i> at 1948-1949. The majority says that in a <i>Bivens</i> action, \"where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants,\" \"the term `supervisory liability' is a misnomer,\" and that \"[a]bsent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Lest there be any mistake, in these words the majority is not narrowing the scope of supervisory liability; it is eliminating <i>Bivens</i> supervisory liability entirely. The nature of a supervisory liability theory is that the supervisor may be liable, under certain conditions, for the wrongdoing of his subordinates, and it is this very principle that the majority rejects. <i>Ante,</i> at 1952 (\"[P]etitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1958</span> acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic\").</p>\n<p>The dangers of the majority's readiness to proceed without briefing and argument are apparent in its cursory analysis, which rests on the assumption that only two outcomes are possible here: <i>respondeat superior</i> liability, in which \"an employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees while acting within the scope of their employment,\" Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.04 (2005), or no supervisory liability at all. The dichotomy is false. Even if an employer is not liable for the actions of his employee solely because the employee was acting within the scope of employment, there still might be conditions to render a supervisor liable for the conduct of his subordinate. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera,</i> 431 F.3d 1, 14 (C.A.1 2005) (distinguishing between <i>respondeat superior</i> liability and supervisory liability); <i>Bennett v. Eastpointe,</i> 410 F.3d 810, 818 (C.A.6 2005) (same); <i>Richardson v. Goord,</i> 347 F.3d 431, 435 (C.A.2 2003) (same); <i>Hall v. Lombardi,</i> 996 F.2d 954, 961 (C.A.8 1993) (same).</p>\n<p>In fact, there is quite a spectrum of possible tests for supervisory liability: it could be imposed where a supervisor has actual knowledge of a subordinate's constitutional violation and acquiesces, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Baker v. Monroe Twp.,</i> 50 F.3d 1186, 1194 (C.A.3 1995); <i>Woodward v. Worland,</i> 977 F.2d 1392, 1400 (C.A.10 1992); or where supervisors \"`know about the conduct and facilitate it, approve it, condone it, or turn a blind eye for fear of what they might see,'\" <i>International Action Center v. United States,</i> 365 F.3d 20, 28 (C.A.D.C. 2004) (Roberts, J.) (quoting <i>Jones v. Chicago,</i> 856 F.2d 985, 992 (C.A.7 1988) (Posner, J.)); or where the supervisor has no actual knowledge of the violation but was reckless in his supervision of the subordinate, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Hall, supra,</i> at 961; or where the supervisor was grossly negligent, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico,</i> 864 F.2d 881, 902 (C.A.1 1988). I am unsure what the general test for supervisory liability should be, and in the absence of briefing and argument I am in no position to choose or devise one.</p>\n<p>Neither is the majority, but what is most remarkable about its foray into supervisory liability is that its conclusion has no bearing on its resolution of the case. The majority says that all of the allegations in the complaint that Ashcroft and Mueller authorized, condoned, or even were aware of their subordinates' discriminatory conduct are \"conclusory\" and therefore are \"not entitled to be assumed true.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1951. As I explain below, this conclusion is unsound, but on the majority's understanding of Rule 8(a)(2) pleading standards, even if the majority accepted Ashcroft and Mueller's concession and asked whether the complaint sufficiently alleges knowledge and deliberate indifference, it presumably would still conclude that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts and must be dismissed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Given petitioners' concession, the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2). Ashcroft and Mueller admit they are liable for their subordinates' conduct if they \"had actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being `of high interest' and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\" Brief for Petitioners 50. Iqbal alleges <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1959</span> that after the September 11 attacks the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \"arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men,\" Complaint \u00b6 47, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, that many of these men were designated by high-ranking FBI officials as being \"`of high interest,'\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 48, 50, at 164a, and that in many cases, including Iqbal's, this designation was made \"because of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees' involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 49. The complaint further alleges that Ashcroft was the \"principal architect of the policies and practices challenged,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 10, at 157a, and that Mueller \"was instrumental in the adoption, promulgation, and implementation of the policies and practices challenged,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 11. According to the complaint, Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [Iqbal] to these conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a-173a. The complaint thus alleges, at a bare minimum, that Ashcroft and Mueller knew of and condoned the discriminatory policy their subordinates carried out. Actually, the complaint goes further in alleging that Ashcroft and Muller affirmatively acted to create the discriminatory detention policy. If these factual allegations are true, Ashcroft and Mueller were, at the very least, aware of the discriminatory policy being implemented and deliberately indifferent to it.</p>\n<p>Ashcroft and Mueller argue that these allegations fail to satisfy the \"plausibility standard\" of <i>Twombly.</i> They contend that Iqbal's claims are implausible because such high-ranking officials \"tend not to be personally involved in the specific actions of lower-level officers down the bureaucratic chain of command.\" Brief for Petitioners 28. But this response bespeaks a fundamental misunderstanding of the enquiry that <i>Twombly</i> demands. <i>Twombly</i> does not require a court at the motion-to-dismiss stage to consider whether the factual allegations are probably true. We made it clear, on the contrary, that a court must take the allegations as true, no matter how skeptical the court may be. See <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (a court must proceed \"on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)\"); <i>id.,</i> at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (\"[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable\"); see also <i>Neitzke v. Williams,</i> 490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (\"Rule 12(b)(6) does not countenance . . . dismissals based on a judge's disbelief of a complaint's factual allegations\"). The sole exception to this rule lies with allegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as we know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff's recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel. That is not what we have here.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Twombly,</i> the relevant question is whether, assuming the factual allegations are true, the plaintiff has stated a ground for relief that is plausible. That is, in <i>Twombly</i>'s words, a plaintiff must \"allege facts\" that, taken as true, are \"suggestive of illegal conduct.\" 550 U.S., at 564, n. 8, 127 S.Ct. 1955. In <i>Twombly,</i> we were faced with allegations of a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act through parallel conduct. The difficulty was that the conduct alleged was \"consistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955. We held that in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1960</span> that sort of circumstance, \"[a]n allegation of parallel conduct is . . . much like a naked assertion of conspiracy in a \u00a7 1 complaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (brackets omitted). Here, by contrast, the allegations in the complaint are neither confined to naked legal conclusions nor consistent with legal conduct. The complaint alleges that FBI officials discriminated against Iqbal solely on account of his race, religion, and national origin, and it alleges the knowledge and deliberate indifference that, by Ashcroft and Mueller's own admission, are sufficient to make them liable for the illegal action. Iqbal's complaint therefore contains \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>I do not understand the majority to disagree with this understanding of \"plausibility\" under <i>Twombly.</i> Rather, the majority discards the allegations discussed above with regard to Ashcroft and Mueller as conclusory, and is left considering only two statements in the complaint: that \"the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11,\" Complaint \u00b6 47, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 69, at 168a. See <i>ante,</i> at 1951. I think the majority is right in saying that these allegations suggest only that Ashcroft and Mueller \"sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1952, and that this produced \"a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1951-1952. And I agree that the two allegations selected by the majority, standing alone, do not state a plausible entitlement to relief for unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n<p>But these allegations do not stand alone as the only significant, nonconclusory statements in the complaint, for the complaint contains many allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to the discriminatory practices of their subordinates. See Complaint \u00b610, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (Ashcroft was the \"principal architect\" of the discriminatory policy); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 11 (Mueller was \"instrumental\" in adopting and executing the discriminatory policy); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a-173a (Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" Iqbal to harsh conditions \"as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest\").</p>\n<p>The majority says that these are \"bare assertions\" that, \"much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly,</i> amount to nothing more than a `formulaic recitation of the elements' of a constitutional discrimination claim\" and therefore are \"not entitled to be assumed true.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1951 (quoting <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). The fallacy of the majority's position, however, lies in looking at the relevant assertions in isolation. The complaint contains specific allegations that, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Chief of the FBI's International Terrorism Operations Section and the Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the FBI's New York Field Office implemented a policy that discriminated against Arab Muslim men, including Iqbal, solely on account of their race, religion, or national origin. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1961</span> Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 47-53, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a-165a. Viewed in light of these subsidiary allegations, the allegations singled out by the majority as \"conclusory\" are no such thing. Iqbal's claim is not that Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" him to a discriminatory practice that is left undefined; his allegation is that \"they knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" him to a particular, discrete, discriminatory policy detailed in the complaint. Iqbal does not say merely that Ashcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimination, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-defined constitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to create the discriminatory policy he has described. Taking the complaint as a whole, it gives Ashcroft and Mueller \"`fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.'\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (quoting <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (omission in original)).</p>\n<p>That aside, the majority's holding that the statements it selects are conclusory cannot be squared with its treatment of certain other allegations in the complaint as nonconclusory. For example, the majority takes as true the statement that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\" Complaint \u00b6 69, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a; see <i>ante,</i> at 1951. This statement makes two points: (1) after September 11, the FBI held certain detainees in highly restrictive conditions, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller discussed and approved these conditions. If, as the majority says, these allegations are not conclusory, then I cannot see why the majority deems it merely conclusory when Iqbal alleges that (1) after September 11, the FBI designated Arab Muslim detainees as being of \"`high interest'\" \"because of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees' involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 48-50, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed\" to that discrimination, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a. By my lights, there is no principled basis for the majority's disregard of the allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to their subordinates' discrimination.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice SOUTER and join his dissent. I write separately to point out that, like the Court, I believe it important to prevent unwarranted litigation from interfering with \"the proper execution of the work of the Government.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1953. But I cannot find in that need adequate justification for the Court's interpretation of <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The law, after all, provides trial courts with other legal weapons designed to prevent unwarranted interference. As the Second Circuit explained, where a Government defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for managing a case and \"mindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense,\" can structure discovery in ways that diminish the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public officials. See <i>Iqbal v. Hasty,</i> 490 F.3d 143, 158 (2007). A district court, for example, can begin discovery with lower level government defendants before determining whether a case can be made to allow <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1962</span> discovery related to higher level government officials. See <i>ibid.</i> Neither the briefs nor the Court's opinion provides convincing grounds for finding these alternative case-management tools inadequate, either in general or in the case before us. For this reason, as well as for the independently sufficient reasons set forth in Justice SOUTER's opinion, I would affirm the Second Circuit.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Iqbal makes no claim against Ashcroft and Mueller based simply on his right, as a pretrial detainee, to be free from punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt on the fraud charges. See <i>Bell v. Wolfish,</i> 441 U.S. 520, 535, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<p>[2]  If I am mistaken, and the majority's rejection of the concession is somehow outcome determinative, then its approach is even more unfair to Iqbal than previously explained, see. <i>supra,</i> at 1957, for Iqbal had no reason to argue the (apparently dispositive) supervisory liability standard in light of the concession.</p>\n\n</div>",

Argued December 10, 2008\u2014Decided May 18, 2009\nFollowing the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, respondent Iqbal,\n  a Pakistani Muslim, was arrested on criminal charges and detained\n  by federal officials under restrictive conditions. Iqbal filed a Bivens\n  action against numerous federal officials, including petitioner\n  Ashcroft, the former Attorney General, and petitioner Mueller, the\n  Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See Bivens v.\n  Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388. The complaint al\n  leged, inter alia, that petitioners designated Iqbal a person \u201cof high\n  interest\u201d on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contra\n  vention of the First and Fifth Amendments; that the FBI, under\n  Mueller\u2019s direction, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim\n  men as part of its September-11th investigation; that petitioners\n  knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\n  Iqbal to harsh conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely\n  on account of the prohibited factors and for no legitimate penological\n  interest; and that Ashcroft was the policy\u2019s \u201cprincipal architect\u201d and\n  Mueller was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in its adoption and execution. After the\n  District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss on qualified\n  immunity grounds, they invoked the collateral order doctrine to file\n  an interlocutory appeal in the Second Circuit. Affirming, that court\n  assumed without discussion that it had jurisdiction and focused on\n  the standard set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S.\n  544, for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a mo\n  tion to dismiss. Concluding that Twombly\u2019s \u201cflexible plausibility\n  standard\u201d obliging a pleader to amplify a claim with factual allega\n  tions where necessary to render it plausible was inapplicable in the\n  context of petitioners\u2019 appeal, the court held that Iqbal\u2019s complaint\n2                         ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    was adequate to allege petitioners\u2019 personal involvement in discrimi\n    natory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitu\n    tional law.\nHeld:\n    1. The Second Circuit had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the\n District Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss. Pp. 6\u2013\n 10.\n       (a) Denial of a qualified-immunity claim can fall within the nar\n row class of prejudgment orders reviewable under the collateral-order\n doctrine so long as the order \u201cturns on an issue of law.\u201d Mitchell v.\n Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530. The doctrine\u2019s applicability in this con\n text is well established; an order rejecting qualified immunity at the\n motion-to-dismiss stage is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291,\n which vests courts of appeals with \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all fi\n nal decisions of the district courts.\u201d Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S.\n 299, 307. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (b) Under these principles, the Court of Appeals had, and this\n Court has, jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s order. Because the\n order turned on an issue of law and rejected the qualified-immunity\n defense, it was a final decision \u201csubject to immediate appeal.\u201d\n Behrens, supra, at 307. Pp. 8\u201310.\n    2. Iqbal\u2019s complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for\n purposeful and unlawful discrimination. Pp. 11\u201323.\n       (a) This Court assumes, without deciding, that Iqbal\u2019s First\n Amendment claim is actionable in a Bivens action, see Hartman v.\n Moore, 547 U. S. 250, 254, n. 2. Because vicarious liability is inappli\n cable to Bivens and \u00a71983 suits, see, e.g., Monell v. New York City\n Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691, the plaintiff in a suit such\n as the present one must plead that each Government-official defen\n dant, through his own individual actions, has violated the Constitu\n tion. Purposeful discrimination requires more than \u201cintent as voli\n tion or intent as awareness of consequences\u201d; it involves a\n decisionmaker\u2019s undertaking a course of action \u201c \u2018because of,\u2019 not\n merely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 [the action\u2019s] adverse effects upon an identifiable\n group.\u201d Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256,\n 279. Iqbal must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petition\n ers adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a\n neutral, investigative reason, but for the purpose of discriminating on\n account of race, religion, or national origin. Pp. 11\u201313.\n       (b) Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint\n must contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that\n the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d \u201c[D]etailed factual allegations\u201d are\n not required, Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for\n sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a claim to relief\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthat is plausible on its face,\u201d id., at 570. A claim has facial plausibil\nity when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct\nalleged. Id., at 556. Two working principles underlie Twombly.\nFirst, the tenet that a court must accept a complaint\u2019s allegations as\ntrue is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action\u2019s ele\nments, supported by mere conclusory statements. Id., at 555. Sec\nond, determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim is con\ntext-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on its experience\nand common sense. Id., at 556. A court considering a motion to dis\nmiss may begin by identifying allegations that, because they are\nmere conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While\nlegal conclusions can provide the complaint\u2019s framework, they must\nbe supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded fac\ntual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then de\ntermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\nPp. 13\u201316.\n     (c) Iqbal\u2019s pleadings do not comply with Rule 8 under Twombly.\nSeveral of his allegations\u2014that petitioners agreed to subject him to\nharsh conditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of discrimi\nnatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest; that\nAshcroft was that policy\u2019s \u201cprincipal architect\u201d; and that Mueller was\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d in its adoption and execution\u2014are conclusory and not\nentitled to be assumed true. Moreover, the factual allegations that\nthe FBI, under Mueller, arrested and detained thousands of Arab\nMuslim men, and that he and Ashcroft approved the detention policy,\ndo not plausibly suggest that petitioners purposefully discriminated\non prohibited grounds. Given that the September 11 attacks were\nperpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate\npolicy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals be\ncause of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a dispa\nrate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy\u2019s\npurpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims. Even if the com\nplaint\u2019s well-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that\nIqbal\u2019s arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that\ninference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against pe\ntitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding detainees\ncategorized as \u201cof high interest,\u201d but the complaint does not contain\nfacts plausibly showing that their policy was based on discriminatory\nfactors. Pp. 16\u201320.\n     (d) Three of Iqbal\u2019s arguments are rejected. Pp. 20\u201323.\n        (i) His claim that Twombly should be limited to its antitrust\ncontext is not supported by that case or the Federal Rules. Because\nTwombly interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn governs the\n4                          ASHCROFT v.

P. 20.\n            (ii) Rule 8\u2019s pleading requirements need not be relaxed based\n    on the Second Circuit\u2019s instruction that the District Court cabin dis\n    covery to preserve petitioners\u2019 qualified-immunity defense in antici\n    pation of a summary judgment motion. The question presented by a\n    motion to dismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the con\n    trols placed on the discovery process. Twombly, supra, at 559. And\n    because Iqbal\u2019s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled\n    to discovery, cabined or otherwise. Pp. 20\u201322.\n            (iii) Rule 9(b)\u2014which requires particularity when pleading\n    \u201cfraud or mistake\u201d but allows \u201cother conditions of a person\u2019s mind [to]\n    be alleged generally\u201d\u2014does not require courts to credit a complaint\u2019s\n    conclusory statements without reference to its factual context. Rule 9\n    merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an\n    elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license to evade\n    Rule 8\u2019s less rigid, though still operative, strictures. Pp. 22\u201323.\n         (e) The Second Circuit should decide in the first instance\n    whether to remand to the District Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave\n    to amend his deficient complaint.

ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL,\n   ET AL., PETITIONERS v. JAVAID IQBAL ET AL.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                [May 18, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Respondent Javaid Iqbal is a citizen of Pakistan and a\nMuslim. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist\nattacks he was arrested in the United States on criminal\ncharges and detained by federal officials. Respondent\nclaims he was deprived of various constitutional protec\u00ad\ntions while in federal custody. To redress the alleged\ndeprivations, respondent filed a complaint against numer\u00ad\nous federal officials, including John Ashcroft, the former\nAttorney General of the United States, and Robert Muel\u00ad\nler, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI). Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in the case\nnow before us. As to these two petitioners, the complaint\nalleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that\nsubjected respondent to harsh conditions of confinement\non account of his race, religion, or national origin.\n   In the District Court petitioners raised the defense of\nqualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit, con\u00ad\ntending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim\nagainst them. The District Court denied the motion to\ndismiss, concluding the complaint was sufficient to state a\n2                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim despite petitioners\u2019 official status at the times in\nquestion. Petitioners brought an interlocutory appeal in\nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court,\nwithout discussion, assumed it had jurisdiction over the\norder denying the motion to dismiss; and it affirmed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s decision.\n  Respondent\u2019s account of his prison ordeal could, if\nproved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some\ngovernmental actors. But the allegations and pleadings\nwith respect to these actors are not before us here. This\ncase instead turns on a narrower question: Did respon\u00ad\ndent, as the plaintiff in the District Court, plead factual\nmatter that, if taken as true, states a claim that petition\u00ad\ners deprived him of his clearly established constitutional\nrights. We hold respondent\u2019s pleadings are insufficient.\n                                I\n   Following the 2001 attacks, the FBI and other entities\nwithin the Department of Justice began an investigation\nof vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent them\nfrom attacking anew. The FBI dedicated more than 4,000\nspecial agents and 3,000 support personnel to the en\u00ad\ndeavor. By September 18 \u201cthe FBI had received more\nthan 96,000 tips or potential leads from the public.\u201d Dept.\nof Justice, Office of Inspector General, The September 11\nDetainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on\nImmigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation\nof the September 11 Attacks 1, 11\u201312 (Apr. 2003) (herein\u00ad\nafter OIG Report), http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/\n0306/full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0&bcsi_scan\n_filename=full.pdf (as visited May 14, 2009, and available\nin Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n   In the ensuing months the FBI questioned more than\n1,000 people with suspected links to the attacks in par\u00ad\nticular or to terrorism in general. Id., at 1. Of those indi\u00ad\nviduals, some 762 were held on immigration charges; and\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Id., at 111. The high\u00ad\ninterest detainees were held under restrictive conditions\ndesigned to prevent them from communicating with the\ngeneral prison population or the outside world. Id., at\n112\u2013113.\n   Respondent was one of the detainees. According to his\ncomplaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and Im\u00ad\nmigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on\ncharges of fraud in relation to identification documents\nand conspiracy to defraud the United States. Iqbal v.\nHasty, 490 F. 3d 143, 147\u2013148 (CA2 2007). Pending trial\nfor those crimes, respondent was housed at the Metropoli\u00ad\ntan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York.\nRespondent was designated a person \u201cof high interest\u201d to\nthe September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was\nplaced in a section of the MDC known as the Administra\u00ad\ntive Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU). Id.,\nat 148. As the facility\u2019s name indicates, the ADMAX SHU\nincorporates the maximum security conditions allowable\nunder Federal Bureau of Prison regulations.              Ibid.\nADMAX SHU detainees were kept in lockdown 23 hours a\nday, spending the remaining hour outside their cells in\nhandcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer\nescort. Ibid.\n   Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal charges,\nserved a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his\nnative Pakistan. Id., at 149. He then filed a Bivens action\nin the United States District Court for the Eastern Dis\u00ad\ntrict of New York against 34 current and former federal\nofficials and 19 \u201cJohn Doe\u201d federal corrections officers.\nSee Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403\nU. S. 388 (1971). The defendants range from the correc\u00ad\ntional officers who had day-to-day contact with respondent\nduring the term of his confinement, to the wardens of the\nMDC facility, all the way to petitioners\u2014officials who\n4                    ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwere at the highest level of the federal law enforcement\nhierarchy. First Amended Complaint in No. 04\u2013CV\u20131809\n(JG)(JA), \u00b6\u00b610\u221211, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (hereinafter\nComplaint).\n   The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not challenge\nrespondent\u2019s arrest or his confinement in the MDC\u2019s gen\u00ad\neral prison population. Rather, it concentrates on his\ntreatment while confined to the ADMAX SHU. The com\u00ad\nplaint sets forth various claims against defendants who\nare not before us. For instance, the complaint alleges that\nrespondent\u2019s jailors \u201ckicked him in the stomach, punched\nhim in the face, and dragged him across\u201d his cell without\njustification, id., \u00b6113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a; sub\u00ad\njected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when\nhe posed no safety risk to himself or others, id., \u00b6\u00b6143\u2013\n145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and\nother Muslims pray because there would be \u201c[n]o prayers\nfor terrorists,\u201d id., \u00b6154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a.\n   The allegations against petitioners are the only ones\nrelevant here. The complaint contends that petitioners\ndesignated respondent a person of high interest on ac\u00ad\ncount of his race, religion, or national origin, in contraven\u00ad\ntion of the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitu\u00ad\ntion. The complaint alleges that \u201cthe [FBI], under the\ndirection of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained\nthousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its investiga\u00ad\ntion of the events of September 11.\u201d Id., \u00b647, at 164a. It\nfurther alleges that \u201c[t]he policy of holding post-\nSeptember-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions\nof confinement until they were \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was\napproved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in\ndiscussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\u201d Id.,\n\u00b669, at 168a. Lastly, the complaint posits that petitioners\n\u201ceach knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously\nagreed to subject\u201d respondent to harsh conditions of con\u00ad\nfinement \u201cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his]\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreligion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate\npenological interest.\u201d Id., \u00b696, at 172a\u2013173a. The plead\u00ad\ning names Ashcroft as the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of the\npolicy, id., \u00b610, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as \u201cinstru\u00ad\nmental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementa\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Id., \u00b611, at 157a.\n   Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to\nstate sufficient allegations to show their own involvement\nin clearly established unconstitutional conduct. The Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court denied their motion. Accepting all of the alle\u00ad\ngations in respondent\u2019s complaint as true, the court held\nthat \u201cit cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on\nwhich [respondent] would be entitled to relief as against\u201d\npetitioners. Id., at 136a\u2013137a (relying on Conley v. Gib\nson, 355 U. S. 41 (1957)). Invoking the collateral-order\ndoctrine petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nWhile that appeal was pending, this Court decided Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544 (2007), which\ndiscussed the standard for evaluating whether a complaint\nis sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   The Court of Appeals considered Twombly\u2019s applicabil\u00ad\nity to this case. Acknowledging that Twombly retired the\nConley no-set-of-facts test relied upon by the District\nCourt, the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion discussed at length\nhow to apply this Court\u2019s \u201cstandard for assessing the\nadequacy of pleadings.\u201d 490 F. 3d, at 155. It concluded\nthat Twombly called for a \u201cflexible \u2018plausibility standard,\u2019\nwhich obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some\nfactual allegations in those contexts where such amplifica\u00ad\ntion is needed to render the claim plausible.\u201d Id., at 157\u2013\n158. The court found that petitioners\u2019 appeal did not\npresent one of \u201cthose contexts\u201d requiring amplification. As\na consequence, it held respondent\u2019s pleading adequate to\nallege petitioners\u2019 personal involvement in discriminatory\ndecisions which, if true, violated clearly established consti\u00ad\n6                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntutional law. Id., at 174.\n   Judge Cabranes concurred. He agreed that the major\u00ad\nity\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of the relevant pleading standards re\u00ad\nflect[ed] the uneasy compromise . . . between a qualified\nimmunity privilege rooted in the need to preserve the\neffectiveness of government as contemplated by our consti\u00ad\ntutional structure and the pleading requirements of Rule\n8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Id., at 178\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Judge\nCabranes nonetheless expressed concern at the prospect of\nsubjecting high-ranking Government officials\u2014entitled to\nassert the defense of qualified immunity and charged with\nresponding to \u201ca national and international security emer\u00ad\ngency unprecedented in the history of the American Re\u00ad\npublic\u201d\u2014to the burdens of discovery on the basis of a\ncomplaint as nonspecific as respondent\u2019s. Id., at 179.\nReluctant to vindicate that concern as a member of the\nCourt of Appeals, ibid., Judge Cabranes urged this Court\nto address the appropriate pleading standard \u201cat the\nearliest opportunity.\u201d Id., at 178. We granted certiorari,\n554 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse.\n                              II\n   We first address whether the Court of Appeals had\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court\u2019s\norder denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss. Respondent\ndisputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue. We are\nnot free to pretermit the question. Subject-matter juris\u00ad\ndiction cannot be forfeited or waived and should be consid\u00ad\nered when fairly in doubt. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546\nU. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing United States v. Cotton, 535\nU. S. 625, 630 (2002)). According to respondent, the Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss\nis not appealable under the collateral-order doctrine. We\ndisagree.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               A\n    With exceptions inapplicable here, Congress has vested\nthe courts of appeals with \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all\nfinal decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71291. Though the statute\u2019s finality require\u00ad\nment ensures that \u201cinterlocutory appeals\u2014appeals before\nthe end of district court proceedings\u2014are the exception,\nnot the rule,\u201d Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 309 (1995),\nit does not prevent \u201creview of all prejudgment orders.\u201d\nBehrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 305 (1996). Under the\ncollateral-order doctrine a limited set of district-court\norders are reviewable \u201cthough short of final judgment.\u201d\nIbid. The orders within this narrow category \u201care imme\u00ad\ndiately appealable because they \u2018finally determine claims\nof right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted\nin the action, too important to be denied review and too\nindependent of the cause itself to require that appellate\nconsideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudi\u00ad\ncated.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan\nCorp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949)).\n    A district-court decision denying a Government officer\u2019s\nclaim of qualified immunity can fall within the narrow\nclass of appealable orders despite \u201cthe absence of a final\njudgment.\u201d Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530 (1985).\nThis is so because qualified immunity\u2014which shields\nGovernment officials \u201cfrom liability for civil damages\ninsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly estab\u00ad\nlished statutory or constitutional rights,\u201d Harlow v. Fitz\ngerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982)\u2014is both a defense to\nliability and a limited \u201centitlement not to stand trial or\nface the other burdens of litigation.\u201d Mitchell, supra, 472\nU. S., at 526. Provided it \u201cturns on an issue of law,\u201d id., at\n530, a district-court order denying qualified immunity\n\u201c \u2018conclusively determine[s]\u2019 \u201d that the defendant must bear\nthe burdens of discovery; is \u201cconceptually distinct from the\nmerits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim\u201d; and would prove \u201ceffec\u00ad\n8                    ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d Id.,\nat 527\u2212528 (citing Cohen, supra, at 546). As a general\nmatter, the collateral-order doctrine may have expanded\nbeyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the\nstrict application of the criteria set out in Cohen. But the\napplicability of the doctrine in the context of qualified\u00ad\nimmunity claims is well established; and this Court has\nbeen careful to say that a district court\u2019s order rejecting\nqualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a\nproceeding is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of\n\u00a71291. Behrens, 516 U. S., at 307.\n                                B\n   Applying these principles, we conclude that the Court of\nAppeals had jurisdiction to hear petitioners\u2019 appeal. The\nDistrict Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dis\u00ad\nmiss turned on an issue of law and rejected the defense of\nqualified immunity. It was therefore a final decision\n\u201csubject to immediate appeal.\u201d Ibid. Respondent says\nthat \u201ca qualified immunity appeal based solely on the\ncomplaint\u2019s failure to state a claim, and not on the ulti\u00ad\nmate issues relevant to the qualified immunity defense\nitself, is not a proper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent Iqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief). In\nother words, respondent contends the Court of Appeals\nhad jurisdiction to determine whether his complaint avers\na clearly established constitutional violation but that it\nlacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his plead\u00ad\nings. Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate\njurisdiction is not so strictly confined.\n     In Hartman v. Moore, 547 U. S. 250 (2006), the Court\nreviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified im\u00ad\nmunity. The legal issue decided in Hartman concerned\nthe elements a plaintiff \u201cmust plead and prove in order to\nwin\u201d a First Amendment retaliation claim. Id., at 257,\nn. 5. Similarly, two Terms ago in Wilkie v. Robbins, 551\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. 537 (2007), the Court considered another interlocu\u00ad\ntory order denying qualified immunity. The legal issue\nthere was whether a Bivens action can be employed to\nchallenge interference with property rights. 551 U. S., at\n549, n. 4. These cases cannot be squared with respon\u00ad\ndent\u2019s argument that the collateral-order doctrine restricts\nappellate jurisdiction to the \u201cultimate issu[e]\u201d whether the\nlegal wrong asserted was a violation of clearly established\nlaw while excluding the question whether the facts\npleaded establish such a violation. Iqbal Brief 15. Indeed,\nthe latter question is even more clearly within the cate\u00ad\ngory of appealable decisions than the questions presented\nin Hartman and Wilkie, since whether a particular com\u00ad\nplaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of\nlaw cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded.\nIn that sense the sufficiency of respondent\u2019s pleadings is\nboth \u201cinextricably intertwined with,\u201d Swint v. Chambers\nCounty Comm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 35, 51 (1995), and \u201cdirectly\nimplicated by,\u201d Hartman, supra, at 257, n. 5, the qualified\nimmunity defense.\n   Respondent counters that our holding in Johnson, 515\nU. S. 304, confirms the want of subject-matter jurisdiction\nhere. That is incorrect. The allegation in Johnson was\nthat five defendants, all of them police officers, unlawfully\nbeat the plaintiff. Johnson considered \u201cthe appealability\nof a portion of\u201d the District Court\u2019s summary judgment\norder that, \u201cthough entered in a \u2018qualified immunity\u2019 case,\ndetermine[d] only\u201d that there was a genuine issue of mate\u00ad\nrial fact that three of the defendants participated in the\nbeating. Id., at 313.\n   In finding that order not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for purposes\nof \u00a71291, the Johnson Court cited Mitchell for the proposi\u00ad\ntion that only decisions turning \u201c \u2018on an issue of law\u2019 \u201d are\nsubject to immediate appeal. 515 U. S., at 313. Though\ndetermining whether there is a genuine issue of material\nfact at summary judgment is a question of law, it is a legal\n10                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion that sits near the law-fact divide. Or as we said\nin Johnson, it is a \u201cfact-related\u201d legal inquiry. Id., at 314.\nTo conduct it, a court of appeals may be required to con\u00ad\nsult a \u201cvast pretrial record, with numerous conflicting\naffidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials.\u201d\nId., at 316. That process generally involves matters more\nwithin a district court\u2019s ken and may replicate inefficiently\nquestions that will arise on appeal following final judg\u00ad\nment. Ibid. Finding those concerns predominant, John\nson held that the collateral orders that are \u201cfinal\u201d under\nMitchell turn on \u201cabstract,\u201d rather than \u201cfact-based,\u201d\nissues of law. 515 U. S., at 317.\n   The concerns that animated the decision in Johnson are\nabsent when an appellate court considers the disposition\nof a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient plead\u00ad\nings. True, the categories of \u201cfact-based\u201d and \u201cabstract\u201d\nlegal questions used to guide the Court\u2019s decision in John\nson are not well defined. Here, however, the order deny\u00ad\ning petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss falls well within the\nlatter class. Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals\nconsidered only the allegations contained within the four\ncorners of respondent\u2019s complaint; resort to a \u201cvast pretrial\nrecord\u201d on petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss was unnecessary.\nId., at 316. And determining whether respondent\u2019s com\u00ad\nplaint has the \u201cheft\u201d to state a claim is a task well within\nan appellate court\u2019s core competency. Twombly, 550 U. S.,\nat 557. Evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint is not a\n\u201cfact-based\u201d question of law, so the problem the Court\nsought to avoid in Johnson is not implicated here. The\nDistrict Court\u2019s order denying petitioners\u2019 motion to dis\u00ad\nmiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine\nover which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has,\njurisdiction. We proceed to consider the merits of peti\u00ad\ntioners\u2019 appeal.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009) \n        11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III \n\n   In Twombly, supra, at 553\u2013554, the Court found it\nnecessary first to discuss the antitrust principles impli\u00ad\ncated by the complaint. Here too we begin by taking note\nof the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim of\nunconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled\nto assert the defense of qualified immunity.\n   In Bivens\u2014proceeding on the theory that a right sug\u00ad\ngests a remedy\u2014this Court \u201crecognized for the first time\nan implied private action for damages against federal\nofficers alleged to have violated a citizen\u2019s constitutional\nrights.\u201d Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U. S.\n61, 66 (2001). Because implied causes of action are disfa\u00ad\nvored, the Court has been reluctant to extend Bivens\nliability \u201cto any new context or new category of defen\u00ad\ndants.\u201d 534 U. S., at 68. See also Wilkie, 551 U. S., at\n549 \u2013550. That reluctance might well have disposed of\nrespondent\u2019s First Amendment claim of religious discrimi\u00ad\nnation. For while we have allowed a Bivens action to\nredress a violation of the equal protection component of\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, see\nDavis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), we have not found\nan implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise\nClause. Indeed, we have declined to extend Bivens to a\nclaim sounding in the First Amendment. Bush v. Lucas,\n462 U. S. 367 (1983). Petitioners do not press this argu\u00ad\nment, however, so we assume, without deciding, that\nrespondent\u2019s First Amendment claim is actionable under\nBivens.\n   In the limited settings where Bivens does apply, the\nimplied cause of action is the \u201cfederal analog to suits\nbrought against state officials under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71983.\u201d Hartman, 547 U. S., at 254, n. 2. Cf.\nWilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 609 (1999). Based on the\nrules our precedents establish, respondent correctly con\u00ad\ncedes that Government officials may not be held liable for\n12                    ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthe unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a\ntheory of respondeat superior. Iqbal Brief 46 (\u201c[I]t is un\u00ad\ndisputed that supervisory Bivens liability cannot be estab\u00ad\nlished solely on a theory of respondeat superior\u201d). See\nMonell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S.\n658, 691 (1978) (finding no vicarious liability for a munici\u00ad\npal \u201cperson\u201d under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983); see also Dunlop v.\nMunroe, 7 Cranch 242, 269 (1812) (a federal official\u2019s\nliability \u201cwill only result from his own neglect in not prop\u00ad\nerly superintending the discharge\u201d of his subordinates\u2019\nduties); Robertson v. Sichel, 127 U. S. 507, 515\u2013516 (1888)\n(\u201cA public officer or agent is not responsible for the mis\u00ad\nfeasances or position wrongs, or for the nonfeasances, or\nnegligences, or omissions of duty, of the subagents or\nservants or other persons properly employed by or under\nhim, in the discharge of his official duties\u201d). Because\nvicarious liability is inapplicable to Bivens and \u00a71983\nsuits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official\ndefendant, through the official\u2019s own individual actions,\nhas violated the Constitution.\n   The factors necessary to establish a Bivens violation will\nvary with the constitutional provision at issue. Where the\nclaim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the\nFirst and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear\nthat the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant\nacted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi\nBabalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 540\u2013541 (1993)\n(First Amendment); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229,\n240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent\npurposeful discrimination requires more than \u201cintent as\nvolition or intent as awareness of consequences.\u201d Person\nnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.

It instead involves a decisionmaker\u2019s undertaking\na course of action \u201c \u2018because of,\u2019 not merely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 [the\naction\u2019s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\u201d Ibid.\nIt follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclearly established right, respondent must plead sufficient\nfactual matter to show that petitioners adopted and im\u00ad\nplemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral,\ninvestigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating\non account of race, religion, or national origin.\n   Respondent disagrees. He argues that, under a theory\nof \u201csupervisory liability,\u201d petitioners can be liable for\n\u201cknowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates\u2019 use of\ndiscriminatory criteria to make classification decisions\namong detainees.\u201d Iqbal Brief 45\u201346. That is to say,\nrespondent believes a supervisor\u2019s mere knowledge of his\nsubordinate\u2019s discriminatory purpose amounts to the\nsupervisor\u2019s violating the Constitution. We reject this\nargument. Respondent\u2019s conception of \u201csupervisory liabil\u00ad\nity\u201d is inconsistent with his accurate stipulation that\npetitioners may not be held accountable for the misdeeds\nof their agents. In a \u00a71983 suit or a Bivens action\u2014where\nmasters do not answer for the torts of their servants\u2014the\nterm \u201csupervisory liability\u201d is a misnomer. Absent vicari\u00ad\nous liability, each Government official, his or her title\nnotwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own miscon\u00ad\nduct. In the context of determining whether there is a\nviolation of clearly established right to overcome qualified\nimmunity, purpose rather than knowledge is required to\nimpose Bivens liability on the subordinate for unconstitu\u00ad\ntional discrimination; the same holds true for an official\ncharged with violations arising from his or her superin\u00ad\ntendent responsibilities.\n                              IV \n\n                               A\n\n   We turn to respondent\u2019s complaint. Under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \u201cshort\nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader\nis entitled to relief.\u201d As the Court held in Twombly, 550\nU. S. 544, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does\n14                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot require \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d but it demands\nmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully\u00ad\nharmed-me accusation. Id., at 555 (citing Papasan v.\nAllain, 478 U. S. 265, 286 (1986)). A pleading that offers\n\u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the\nelements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d 550 U. S., at\n555. Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \u201cnaked\nassertion[s]\u201d devoid of \u201cfurther factual enhancement.\u201d Id.,\nat 557.\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must con\u00ad\ntain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u201cstate a\nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d Id., at 570. A\nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads\nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reason\u00ad\nable inference that the defendant is liable for the miscon\u00ad\nduct alleged. Id., at 556. The plausibility standard is not\nakin to a \u201cprobability requirement,\u201d but it asks for more\nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlaw\u00ad\nfully. Ibid. Where a complaint pleads facts that are\n\u201cmerely consistent with\u201d a defendant\u2019s liability, it \u201cstops\nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility of\n\u2018entitlement to relief.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 557 (brackets omitted).\n   Two working principles underlie our decision in\nTwombly. First, the tenet that a court must accept as true\nall of the allegations contained in a complaint is inappli\u00ad\ncable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the\nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclu\u00ad\nsory statements, do not suffice. Id., at 555 (Although for\nthe purposes of a motion to dismiss we must take all of the\nfactual allegations in the complaint as true, we \u201care not\nbound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a\nfactual allegation\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nRule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the\nhyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it\ndoes not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed\nwith nothing more than conclusions. Second, only a com\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a\nmotion to dismiss. Id., at 556. Determining whether a\ncomplaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the\nCourt of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that\nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experi\u00ad\nence and common sense. 490 F. 3d, at 157\u2013158. But\nwhere the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to\ninfer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the\ncomplaint has alleged\u2014but it has not \u201cshow[n]\u201d\u2014\u201cthat the\npleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).\n   In keeping with these principles a court considering a\nmotion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying plead\u00ad\nings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are\nnot entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal con\u00ad\nclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they\nmust be supported by factual allegations. When there are\nwell-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume\ntheir veracity and then determine whether they plausibly\ngive rise to an entitlement to relief.\n   Our decision in Twombly illustrates the two-pronged\napproach. There, we considered the sufficiency of a com\u00ad\nplaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications pro\u00ad\nviders had entered an agreement not to compete and to\nforestall competitive entry, in violation of the Sherman\nAct, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71. Recognizing that \u00a71 enjoins only anti\u00ad\ncompetitive conduct \u201ceffected by a contract, combination,\nor conspiracy,\u201d Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube\nCorp., 467 U. S. 752, 775 (1984), the plaintiffs in Twombly\nflatly pleaded that the defendants \u201cha[d] entered into a\ncontract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive\nentry . . . and ha[d] agreed not to compete with one an\u00ad\nother.\u201d 550 U. S., at 551 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). The complaint also alleged that the defendants\u2019\n\u201cparallel course of conduct . . . to prevent competition\u201d and\ninflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement\nalleged. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n16                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court held the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint deficient under\nRule 8. In doing so it first noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 asser\u00ad\ntion of an unlawful agreement was a \u201c \u2018legal conclusion\u2019 \u201d\nand, as such, was not entitled to the assumption of truth.\nId., at 555. Had the Court simply credited the allegation\nof a conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim\nfor relief and been entitled to proceed perforce. The Court\nnext addressed the \u201cnub\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint\u2014the\nwell-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel\nbehavior\u2014to determine whether it gave rise to a \u201cplausi\u00ad\nble suggestion of conspiracy.\u201d Id., at 565\u2013566. Acknowl\u00ad\nedging that parallel conduct was consistent with an\nunlawful agreement, the Court nevertheless concluded\nthat it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it\nwas not only compatible with, but indeed was more likely\nexplained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market behav\u00ad\nior. Id., at 567. Because the well-pleaded fact of parallel\nconduct, accepted as true, did not plausibly suggest an\nunlawful agreement, the Court held the plaintiffs\u2019 com\u00ad\nplaint must be dismissed. Id., at 570.\n                              B\n  Under Twombly\u2019s construction of Rule 8, we conclude\nthat respondent\u2019s complaint has not \u201cnudged [his] claims\u201d\nof invidious discrimination \u201cacross the line from conceiv\u00ad\nable to plausible.\u201d Ibid.\n  We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in\nthe complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of\ntruth. Respondent pleads that petitioners \u201cknew of, con\u00ad\ndoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\n[him]\u201d to harsh conditions of confinement \u201cas a matter of\npolicy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or\nnational origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\u201d\nComplaint \u00b696, App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a\u2013174a. The\ncomplaint alleges that Ashcroft was the \u201cprincipal archi\u00ad\ntect\u201d of this invidious policy, id., \u00b610, at 157a, and that\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMueller was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in adopting and executing it,\nid., \u00b611, at 157a. These bare assertions, much like the\npleading of conspiracy in Twombly, amount to nothing\nmore than a \u201cformulaic recitation of the elements\u201d of a\nconstitutional discrimination claim, 550 U. S., at 555,\nnamely, that petitioners adopted a policy \u201c \u2018because of,\u2019 not\nmerely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 its adverse effects upon an identifiable\ngroup.\u201d Feeney, 442 U. S., at 279. As such, the allegations\nare conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true.\nTwombly, supra, 550 U. S., at 554\u2013555. To be clear, we do\nnot reject these bald allegations on the ground that they\nare unrealistic or nonsensical. We do not so characterize\nthem any more than the Court in Twombly rejected the\nplaintiffs\u2019 express allegation of a \u201c \u2018contract, combination or\nconspiracy to prevent competitive entry,\u2019 \u201d id., at 551,\nbecause it thought that claim too chimerical to be main\u00ad\ntained. It is the conclusory nature of respondent\u2019s allega\u00ad\ntions, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that\ndisentitles them to the presumption of truth.\n   We next consider the factual allegations in respondent\u2019s\ncomplaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an enti\u00ad\ntlement to relief. The complaint alleges that \u201cthe [FBI],\nunder the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its\ninvestigation of the events of September 11.\u201d Complaint\n\u00b647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a. It further claims that\n\u201c[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in\nhighly restrictive conditions of confinement until they\nwere \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was approved by Defendants\nASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks\nafter September 11, 2001.\u201d Id., \u00b669, at 168a. Taken as\ntrue, these allegations are consistent with petitioners\u2019\npurposefully designating detainees \u201cof high interest\u201d\nbecause of their race, religion, or national origin. But\ngiven more likely explanations, they do not plausibly\nestablish this purpose.\n18                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab\nMuslim hijackers who counted themselves members in\ngood standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist\ngroup. Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim\u2014\nOsama bin Laden\u2014and composed in large part of his Arab\nMuslim disciples. It should come as no surprise that a\nlegitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and\ndetain individuals because of their suspected link to the\nattacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on\nArab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was\nto target neither Arabs nor Muslims. On the facts respon\u00ad\ndent alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely law\u00ad\nful and justified by his nondiscriminatory intent to detain\naliens who were illegally present in the United States and\nwho had potential connections to those who committed\nterrorist acts. As between that \u201cobvious alternative ex\u00ad\nplanation\u201d for the arrests, Twombly, supra, at 567, and the\npurposeful, invidious discrimination respondent asks us to\ninfer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.\n  But even if the complaint\u2019s well-pleaded facts give rise\nto a plausible inference that respondent\u2019s arrest was the\nresult of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference\nalone would not entitle respondent to relief. It is impor\u00ad\ntant to recall that respondent\u2019s complaint challenges\nneither the constitutionality of his arrest nor his initial\ndetention in the MDC. Respondent\u2019s constitutional claims\nagainst petitioners rest solely on their ostensible \u201cpolicy of\nholding post-September-11th detainees\u201d in the ADMAX\nSHU once they were categorized as \u201cof high interest.\u201d\nComplaint \u00b669, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a. To prevail on\nthat theory, the complaint must contain facts plausibly\nshowing that petitioners purposefully adopted a policy of\nclassifying post-September-11 detainees as \u201cof high inter\u00ad\nest\u201d because of their race, religion, or national origin.\n  This the complaint fails to do. Though respondent\nalleges that various other defendants, who are not before\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nus, may have labeled him a person of \u201cof high interest\u201d for\nimpermissible reasons, his only factual allegation against\npetitioners accuses them of adopting a policy approving\n\u201crestrictive conditions of confinement\u201d for post-September\u00ad\n11 detainees until they were \u201c \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI.\u201d Ibid.\nAccepting the truth of that allegation, the complaint does\nnot show, or even intimate, that petitioners purposefully\nhoused detainees in the ADMAX SHU due to their race,\nreligion, or national origin. All it plausibly suggests is\nthat the Nation\u2019s top law enforcement officers, in the\naftermath of a devastating terrorist attack, sought to keep\nsuspected terrorists in the most secure conditions avail\u00ad\nable until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activ\u00ad\nity. Respondent does not argue, nor can he, that such a\nmotive would violate petitioners\u2019 constitutional obliga\u00ad\ntions. He would need to allege more by way of factual\ncontent to \u201cnudg[e]\u201d his claim of purposeful discrimination\n\u201cacross the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d Twombly,\n550 U. S., at 570.\n   To be sure, respondent can attempt to draw certain\ncontrasts between the pleadings the Court considered in\nTwombly and the pleadings at issue here. In Twombly,\nthe complaint alleged general wrongdoing that extended\nover a period of years, id., at 551, whereas here the com\u00ad\nplaint alleges discrete wrongs\u2014for instance, beatings\u2014by\nlower level Government actors. The allegations here, if\ntrue, and if condoned by petitioners, could be the basis for\nsome inference of wrongful intent on petitioners\u2019 part.\nDespite these distinctions, respondent\u2019s pleadings do not\nsuffice to state a claim. Unlike in Twombly, where the\ndoctrine of respondeat superior could bind the corporate\ndefendant, here, as we have noted, petitioners cannot be\nheld liable unless they themselves acted on account of a\nconstitutionally protected characteristic. Yet respondent\u2019s\ncomplaint does not contain any factual allegation suffi\u00ad\ncient to plausibly suggest petitioners\u2019 discriminatory state\n20                  ASHCROFT v.

His pleadings thus do not meet the standard\nnecessary to comply with Rule 8.\n  It is important to note, however, that we express no\nopinion concerning the sufficiency of respondent\u2019s com\u00ad\nplaint against the defendants who are not before us.\nRespondent\u2019s account of his prison ordeal alleges serious\nofficial misconduct that we need not address here.

Iqbal Brief 37\u201338. This argument is\nnot supported by Twombly and is incompatible with the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. Though Twombly de\u00ad\ntermined the sufficiency of a complaint sounding in anti\u00ad\ntrust, the decision was based on our interpretation and\napplication of Rule 8. 550 U. S., at 554. That Rule in turn\ngoverns the pleading standard \u201cin all civil actions and\nproceedings in the United States district courts.\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 1.

S., at 555\u2013556, and n. 3.\n                              2\n  Respondent next implies that our construction of Rule 8\nshould be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals\nhas \u201cinstructed the district court to cabin discovery in such\na way as to preserve\u201d petitioners\u2019 defense of qualified\nimmunity \u201cas much as possible in anticipation of a sum\u00ad\nmary judgment motion.\u201d Iqbal Brief 27. We have held,\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever, that the question presented by a motion to dis\u00ad\nmiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn\non the controls placed upon the discovery process.\nTwombly, supra, at 559 (\u201cIt is no answer to say that a\nclaim just shy of a plausible entitlement to relief can, if\ngroundless, be weeded out early in the discovery process\nthrough careful case management given the common\nlament that the success of judicial supervision in checking\ndiscovery abuse has been on the modest side\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)).\n   Our rejection of the careful-case-management approach\nis especially important in suits where Government-official\ndefendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified\nimmunity. The basic thrust of the qualified-immunity\ndoctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation,\nincluding \u201cavoidance of disruptive discovery.\u201d Siegert v.\nGilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring\nin judgment). There are serious and legitimate reasons for\nthis. If a Government official is to devote time to his or\nher duties, and to the formulation of sound and responsi\u00ad\nble policies, it is counterproductive to require the substan\u00ad\ntial diversion that is attendant to participating in litiga\u00ad\ntion and making informed decisions as to how it should\nproceed. Litigation, though necessary to ensure that\nofficials comply with the law, exacts heavy costs in terms\nof efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and re\u00ad\nsources that might otherwise be directed to the proper\nexecution of the work of the Government. The costs of\ndiversion are only magnified when Government officials\nare charged with responding to, as Judge Cabranes aptly\nput it, \u201ca national and international security emergency\nunprecedented in the history of the American Republic.\u201d\n490 F. 3d, at 179.\n   It is no answer to these concerns to say that discovery\nfor petitioners can be deferred while pretrial proceedings\ncontinue for other defendants. It is quite likely that, when\n22                  ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscovery as to the other parties proceeds, it would prove\nnecessary for petitioners and their counsel to participate\nin the process to ensure the case does not develop in a\nmisleading or slanted way that causes prejudice to their\nposition. Even if petitioners are not yet themselves sub\u00ad\nject to discovery orders, then, they would not be free from\nthe burdens of discovery.\n  We decline respondent\u2019s invitation to relax the pleading\nrequirements on the ground that the Court of Appeals\npromises petitioners minimally intrusive discovery. That\npromise provides especially cold comfort in this pleading\ncontext, where we are impelled to give real content to the\nconcept of qualified immunity for high-level officials who\nmust be neither deterred nor detracted from the vigorous\nperformance of their duties. Because respondent\u2019s com\u00ad\nplaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to dis\u00ad\ncovery, cabined or otherwise.\n                              3\n  Respondent finally maintains that the Federal Rules\nexpressly allow him to allege petitioners\u2019 discriminatory\nintent \u201cgenerally,\u201d which he equates with a conclusory\nallegation. Iqbal Brief 32 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9).\nIt follows, respondent says, that his complaint is suffi\u00ad\nciently well pleaded because it claims that petitioners\ndiscriminated against him \u201con account of [his] religion,\nrace, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penologi\u00ad\ncal interest.\u201d Complaint \u00b696, App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a\u2013\n173a. Were we required to accept this allegation as true,\nrespondent\u2019s complaint would survive petitioners\u2019 motion\nto dismiss. But the Federal Rules do not require courts to\ncredit a complaint\u2019s conclusory statements without refer\u00ad\nence to its factual context.\n  It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when\npleading \u201cfraud or mistake,\u201d while allowing \u201c[m]alice,\nintent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\u2019s mind\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the\nparticularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake.\nRule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discrimina\u00ad\ntory intent under an elevated pleading standard. It does\nnot give him license to evade the less rigid\u2014though still\noperative\u2014strictures of Rule 8. See 5A C. Wright & A.\nMiller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71301, p. 291 (3d\ned. 2004) (\u201c[A] rigid rule requiring the detailed pleading of\na condition of mind would be undesirable because, absent\noverriding considerations pressing for a specificity re\u00ad\nquirement, as in the case of averments of fraud or mis\u00ad\ntake, the general \u2018short and plain statement of the claim\u2019\nmandate in Rule 8(a) . . . should control the second sen\u00ad\ntence of Rule 9(b)\u201d).

S.\n388 (1971), allows personal liability based on a federal\nofficer\u2019s violation of an individual\u2019s rights under the First\nand Fifth Amendments, and it comes to us with the ex\u00ad\nplicit concession of petitioners Ashcroft and Mueller that\nan officer may be subject to Bivens liability as a supervisor\non grounds other than respondeat superior. The Court\napparently rejects this concession and, although it has no\nbearing on the majority\u2019s resolution of this case, does away\nwith supervisory liability under Bivens. The majority then\nmisapplies the pleading standard under Bell Atlantic\nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544 (2007), to conclude that\nthe complaint fails to state a claim. I respectfully dissent\nfrom both the rejection of supervisory liability as a cogni\u00ad\nzable claim in the face of petitioners\u2019 concession, and from\nthe holding that the complaint fails to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n                           I\n                           A\n  Respondent Iqbal was arrested in November 2001 on\ncharges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and\n2                        ASHCROFT v.

Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F. 3d\n143, 147\u2013148 (CA2 2007).

Owing to this designation he was placed\nin the detention center\u2019s Administrative Maximum Special\nHousing Unit for over six months while awaiting the fraud\ntrial. Id., at 148. As I will mention more fully below,\nIqbal contends that Ashcroft and Mueller were at the very\nleast aware of the discriminatory detention policy and\ncondoned it (and perhaps even took part in devising it),\nthereby violating his First and Fifth Amendment rights.1\n   Iqbal claims that on the day he was transferred to the\nspecial unit, prison guards, without provocation, \u201cpicked\nhim up and threw him against the wall, kicked him in the\nstomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across\nthe room.\u201d First Amended Complaint in No. 04\u2013CV\u20131809\n(JG) (JA), \u00b6113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a (hereinafter\nComplaint).

Ashcroft and Mueller then asked this\nCourt to grant certiorari on two questions:\n    \u201c1. Whether a conclusory allegation that a cabinet\u00ad\n    level officer or other high-ranking official knew of,\n    condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly\n    unconstitutional acts purportedly committed by sub\u00ad\n    ordinate officials is sufficient to state individual\u00ad\n    capacity claims against those officials under Bivens.\n    \u201c2. Whether a cabinet-level officer or other high\u00ad\n    ranking official may be held personally liable for the\n    allegedly unconstitutional acts of subordinate officials\n    on the ground that, as high-level supervisors, they\n    had constructive notice of the discrimination allegedly\n    carried out by such subordinate officials.\u201d Pet. for\n    Cert. I.\nThe Court granted certiorari on both questions. The first\nis about pleading; the second goes to the liability standard.\n   In the first question, Ashcroft and Mueller did not ask\nwhether \u201ca cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking\nofficial\u201d who \u201cknew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a\nplaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts committed by\nsubordinate officials\u201d was subject to liability under Bivens.\nIn fact, they conceded in their petition for certiorari that\nthey would be liable if they had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of\ndiscrimination by their subordinates and exhibited \u201c \u2018de\u00ad\nliberate indifference\u2019 \u201d to that discrimination. Pet. for\nCert. 29 (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 837\n(1994)). Instead, they asked the Court to address whether\nIqbal\u2019s allegations against them (which they call conclu\u00ad\nsory) were sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2), and in particu\u00ad\n4                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nlar whether the Court of Appeals misapplied our decision\nin Twombly construing that rule. Pet. for Cert. 11\u201324.\n   In the second question, Ashcroft and Mueller asked this\nCourt to say whether they could be held personally liable\nfor the actions of their subordinates based on the theory\nthat they had constructive notice of their subordinates\u2019\nunconstitutional conduct. Id., at 25\u201333. This was an odd\nquestion to pose, since Iqbal has never claimed that\nAshcroft and Mueller are liable on a constructive notice\ntheory. Be that as it may, the second question challenged\nonly one possible ground for imposing supervisory liability\nunder Bivens. In sum, both questions assumed that a\ndefendant could raise a Bivens claim on theories of super\u00ad\nvisory liability other than constructive notice, and neither\nquestion asked the parties or the Court to address the\nelements of such liability.\n   The briefing at the merits stage was no different.\nAshcroft and Mueller argued that the factual allegations\nin Iqbal\u2019s complaint were insufficient to overcome their\nclaim of qualified immunity; they also contended that they\ncould not be held liable on a theory of constructive notice.\nAgain they conceded, however, that they would be subject\nto supervisory liability if they \u201chad actual knowledge of\nthe assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification\nof suspects as being \u2018of high interest\u2019 and they were delib\u00ad\nerately indifferent to that discrimination.\u201d Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioners 50; see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 21\u201322.\nIqbal argued that the allegations in his complaint were\nsufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) and Twombly, and conceded\nthat as a matter of law he could not recover under a theory\nof respondeat superior. See Brief for Respondent Iqbal 46.\nThus, the parties agreed as to a proper standard of super\u00ad\nvisory liability, and the disputed question was whether\nIqbal\u2019s complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)(2).\n   Without acknowledging the parties\u2019 agreement as to the\nstandard of supervisory liability, the Court asserts that it\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nmust sua sponte decide the scope of supervisory liability\nhere. Ante, at 11\u201313. I agree that, absent Ashcroft and\nMueller\u2019s concession, that determination would have to be\nmade; without knowing the elements of a supervisory\nliability claim, there would be no way to determine\nwhether a plaintiff had made factual allegations amount\u00ad\ning to grounds for relief on that claim. See Twombly, 550\nU. S., at 557\u2013558. But deciding the scope of supervisory\nBivens liability in this case is uncalled for. There are\nseveral reasons, starting with the position Ashcroft and\nMueller have taken and following from it.\n   First, Ashcroft and Mueller have, as noted, made the\ncritical concession that a supervisor\u2019s knowledge of a\nsubordinate\u2019s unconstitutional conduct and deliberate\nindifference to that conduct are grounds for Bivens liabil\u00ad\nity. Iqbal seeks to recover on a theory that Ashcroft and\nMueller at least knowingly acquiesced (and maybe more\nthan acquiesced) in the discriminatory acts of their subor\u00ad\ndinates; if he can show this, he will satisfy Ashcroft and\nMueller\u2019s own test for supervisory liability. See Farmer,\nsupra, at 842 (explaining that a prison official acts with\n\u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d if \u201cthe official acted or failed to\nact despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious\nharm\u201d). We do not normally override a party\u2019s concession,\nsee, e.g., United States v. International Business Machines\nCorp., 517 U. S. 843, 855 (1996) (holding that \u201c[i]t would\nbe inappropriate for us to [e]xamine in this case, without\nthe benefit of the parties\u2019 briefing,\u201d an issue the Govern\u00ad\nment had conceded), and doing so is especially inappropri\u00ad\nate when, as here, the issue is unnecessary to decide the\ncase, see infra, at 8. I would therefore accept Ashcroft and\nMueller\u2019s concession for purposes of this case and proceed\nto consider whether the complaint alleges at least knowl\u00ad\nedge and deliberate indifference.\n   Second, because of the concession, we have received no\nbriefing or argument on the proper scope of supervisory\n6                    ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nliability, much less the full-dress argument we normally\nrequire. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 676\u2013677 (1961)\n(Harlan, J., dissenting). We consequently are in no posi\u00ad\ntion to decide the precise contours of supervisory liability\nhere, this issue being a complicated one that has divided\nthe Courts of Appeals. See infra, at 7\u20138. This Court\nrecently remarked on the danger of \u201cbad decisionmaking\u201d\nwhen the briefing on a question is \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d\nPearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n14), yet today the majority answers a question with no\nbriefing at all. The attendant risk of error is palpable.\n   Finally, the Court\u2019s approach is most unfair to Iqbal.\nHe was entitled to rely on Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s conces\u00ad\nsion, both in their petition for certiorari and in their mer\u00ad\nits briefs, that they could be held liable on a theory of\nknowledge and deliberate indifference. By overriding that\nconcession, the Court denies Iqbal a fair chance to be\nheard on the question.\n                               B\n   The majority, however, does ignore the concession.\nAccording to the majority, because Iqbal concededly can\u00ad\nnot recover on a theory of respondeat superior, it follows\nthat he cannot recover under any theory of supervisory\nliability. Ante, at 13. The majority says that in a Bivens\naction, \u201cwhere masters do not answer for the torts of their\nservants,\u201d \u201cthe term \u2018supervisory liability\u2019 is a misnomer,\u201d\nand that \u201c[a]bsent vicarious liability, each Government\nofficial, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for\nhis or her own misconduct.\u201d Ibid. Lest there be any mis\u00ad\ntake, in these words the majority is not narrowing the\nscope of supervisory liability; it is eliminating Bivens\nsupervisory liability entirely. The nature of a supervisory\nliability theory is that the supervisor may be liable, under\ncertain conditions, for the wrongdoing of his subordinates,\nand it is this very principle that the majority rejects.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 19 (\u201c[P]etitioners cannot be held liable unless they\nthemselves acted on account of a constitutionally protected\ncharacteristic\u201d).\n   The dangers of the majority\u2019s readiness to proceed with\u00ad\nout briefing and argument are apparent in its cursory\nanalysis, which rests on the assumption that only two\noutcomes are possible here: respondeat superior liability,\nin which \u201can employer is subject to liability for torts com\u00ad\nmitted by employees while acting within the scope of their\nemployment,\u201d Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a72.04 (2005),\nor no supervisory liability at all. The dichotomy is false.\nEven if an employer is not liable for the actions of his\nemployee solely because the employee was acting within\nthe scope of employment, there still might be conditions to\nrender a supervisor liable for the conduct of his subordi\u00ad\nnate. See, e.g., Whitfield v. Mel\u00e9ndez-Rivera, 431 F. 3d 1,\n14 (CA1 2005) (distinguishing between respondeat supe\u00ad\nrior liability and supervisory liability); Bennett v. East\u00ad\npointe, 410 F. 3d 810, 818 (CA6 2005) (same); Richardson\nv. Goord, 347 F. 3d 431, 435 (CA2 2003) (same); Hall v.\nLombardi, 996 F. 2d 954, 961 (CA8 1993) (same).\n   In fact, there is quite a spectrum of possible tests for\nsupervisory liability: it could be imposed where a supervi\u00ad\nsor has actual knowledge of a subordinate\u2019s constitutional\nviolation and acquiesces, see, e.g., Baker v. Monroe Twp.,\n50 F. 3d 1186, 1994 (CA3 1995); Woodward v. Worland,\n977 F. 2d 1392, 1400 (CA10 1992); or where supervisors\n\u201c \u2018know about the conduct and facilitate it, approve it,\ncondone it, or turn a blind eye for fear of what they might\nsee,\u2019 \u201d International Action Center v. United States, 365\nF. 3d 20, 28 (CADC 2004) (Roberts, J.) (quoting Jones v.\nChicago, 856 F. 2d 985, 992 (CA7 1988) (Posner, J.)); or\nwhere the supervisor has no actual knowledge of the\nviolation but was reckless in his supervision of the subor\u00ad\ndinate, see, e.g., Hall, supra, at 961; or where the supervi\u00ad\nsor was grossly negligent, see, e.g., Lipsett v. University of\n8                       ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                        SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nPuerto Rico, 864 F. 2d 881, 902 (CA1 1988). I am unsure\nwhat the general test for supervisory liability should be,\nand in the absence of briefing and argument I am in no\nposition to choose or devise one.\n  Neither is the majority, but what is most remarkable\nabout its foray into supervisory liability is that its conclu\u00ad\nsion has no bearing on its resolution of the case. The\nmajority says that all of the allegations in the complaint\nthat Ashcroft and Mueller authorized, condoned, or even\nwere aware of their subordinates\u2019 discriminatory conduct\nare \u201cconclusory\u201d and therefore are \u201cnot entitled to be\nassumed true.\u201d Ante, at 17. As I explain below, this con\u00ad\nclusion is unsound, but on the majority\u2019s understanding of\nRule 8(a)(2) pleading standards, even if the majority ac\u00ad\ncepted Ashcroft and Mueller\u2019s concession and asked\nwhether the complaint sufficiently alleges knowledge and\ndeliberate indifference, it presumably would still conclude\nthat the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts and must\nbe dismissed.2\n                             II\n   Given petitioners\u2019 concession, the complaint satisfies\nRule 8(a)(2). Ashcroft and Mueller admit they are liable\nfor their subordinates\u2019 conduct if they \u201chad actual knowl\u00ad\nedge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classi\u00ad\nfication of suspects as being \u2018of high interest\u2019 and they\nwere deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 50.

S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthese men were designated by high-ranking FBI officials\nas being \u201c \u2018of high interest,\u2019 \u201d id., \u00b6\u00b648, 50, at 164a, and\nthat in many cases, including Iqbal\u2019s, this designation was\nmade \u201cbecause of the race, religion, and national origin of\nthe detainees, and not because of any evidence of the\ndetainees\u2019 involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\u201d\nid., \u00b649. The complaint further alleges that Ashcroft was\nthe \u201cprincipal architect of the policies and practices chal\u00ad\nlenged,\u201d id., \u00b610, at 157a, and that Mueller \u201cwas instru\u00ad\nmental in the adoption, promulgation, and implementa\u00ad\ntion of the policies and practices challenged,\u201d id., \u00b611.\nAccording to the complaint, Ashcroft and Mueller \u201cknew\nof, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to\nsubject [Iqbal] to these conditions of confinement as a\nmatter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race,\nand/or national origin and for no legitimate penological\ninterest.\u201d Id., \u00b696, at 172a\u2013173a. The complaint thus\nalleges, at a bare minimum, that Ashcroft and Mueller\nknew of and condoned the discriminatory policy their\nsubordinates carried out. Actually, the complaint goes\nfurther in alleging that Ashcroft and Muller affirmatively\nacted to create the discriminatory detention policy. If\nthese factual allegations are true, Ashcroft and Mueller\nwere, at the very least, aware of the discriminatory policy\nbeing implemented and deliberately indifferent to it.\n   Ashcroft and Mueller argue that these allegations fail to\nsatisfy the \u201cplausibility standard\u201d of Twombly. They\ncontend that Iqbal\u2019s claims are implausible because such\nhigh-ranking officials \u201ctend not to be personally involved\nin the specific actions of lower-level officers down the\nbureaucratic chain of command.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 28.\nBut this response bespeaks a fundamental misunder\u00ad\nstanding of the enquiry that Twombly demands. Twombly\ndoes not require a court at the motion-to-dismiss stage to\nconsider whether the factual allegations are probably true.\nWe made it clear, on the contrary, that a court must take\n10                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nthe allegations as true, no matter how skeptical the court\nmay be. See Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555 (a court must\nproceed \u201con the assumption that all the allegations in the\ncomplaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)\u201d); id., at 556\n(\u201c[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes\na savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is\nimprobable\u201d); see also Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319,\n327 (1989) (\u201cRule 12(b)(6) does not countenance . . . dis\u00ad\nmissals based on a judge\u2019s disbelief of a complaint\u2019s factual\nallegations\u201d). The sole exception to this rule lies with\nallegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as\nwe know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff\u2019s\nrecent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel. That is\nnot what we have here.\n   Under Twombly, the relevant question is whether,\nassuming the factual allegations are true, the plaintiff has\nstated a ground for relief that is plausible. That is, in\nTwombly\u2019s words, a plaintiff must \u201callege facts\u201d that,\ntaken as true, are \u201csuggestive of illegal conduct.\u201d 550\nU. S., at 564, n. 8. In Twombly, we were faced with allega\u00ad\ntions of a conspiracy to violate \u00a71 of the Sherman Act\nthrough parallel conduct. The difficulty was that the\nconduct alleged was \u201cconsistent with conspiracy, but just\nas much in line with a wide swath of rational and competi\u00ad\ntive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common\nperceptions of the market.\u201d Id., at 554. We held that in\nthat sort of circumstance, \u201c[a]n allegation of parallel con\u00ad\nduct is . . . much like a naked assertion of conspiracy in a\n\u00a71 complaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim,\nbut without some further factual enhancement it stops\nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility of\n\u2018entitlement to relief.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 557 (brackets omitted).\nHere, by contrast, the allegations in the complaint are\nneither confined to naked legal conclusions nor consistent\nwith legal conduct. The complaint alleges that FBI offi\u00ad\ncials discriminated against Iqbal solely on account of his\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nrace, religion, and national origin, and it alleges the\nknowledge and deliberate indifference that, by Ashcroft\nand Mueller\u2019s own admission, are sufficient to make them\nliable for the illegal action. Iqbal\u2019s complaint therefore\ncontains \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is\nplausible on its face.\u201d Id., at 570.\n   I do not understand the majority to disagree with this\nunderstanding of \u201cplausibility\u201d under Twombly. Rather,\nthe majority discards the allegations discussed above with\nregard to Ashcroft and Mueller as conclusory, and is left\nconsidering only two statements in the complaint: that\n\u201cthe [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER,\narrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . .\nas part of its investigation of the events of September 11,\u201d\nComplaint \u00b647, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and that \u201c[t]he\npolicy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly\nrestrictive conditions of confinement until they were\n\u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was approved by Defendants\nASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks\nafter September 11, 2001,\u201d id., \u00b669, at 168a. See ante, at\n17. I think the majority is right in saying that these\nallegations suggest only that Ashcroft and Mueller \u201csought\nto keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions\navailable until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist\nactivity,\u201d ante, at 19, and that this produced \u201ca disparate,\nincidental impact on Arab Muslims,\u201d ante, at 18. And I\nagree that the two allegations selected by the majority,\nstanding alone, do not state a plausible entitlement to\nrelief for unconstitutional discrimination.\n   But these allegations do not stand alone as the only\nsignificant, nonconclusory statements in the complaint, for\nthe complaint contains many allegations linking Ashcroft\nand Mueller to the discriminatory practices of their subor\u00ad\ndinates. See Complaint \u00b610, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a\n(Ashcroft was the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of the discrimina\u00ad\ntory policy); id., \u00b611 (Mueller was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in adopt\u00ad\n12                   ASHCROFT v. IQBAL\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ning and executing the discriminatory policy); id., \u00b696, at\n172a\u2013173a (Ashcroft and Mueller \u201cknew of, condoned, and\nwillfully and maliciously agreed to subject\u201d Iqbal to harsh\nconditions \u201cas a matter of policy, solely on account of [his]\nreligion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate\npenological interest\u201d).\n    The majority says that these are \u201cbare assertions\u201d that,\n\u201cmuch like the pleading of conspiracy in Twombly, amount\nto nothing more than a \u2018formulaic recitation of the ele\u00ad\nments\u2019 of a constitutional discrimination claim\u201d and there\u00ad\nfore are \u201cnot entitled to be assumed true.\u201d Ante, at 17\n(quoting Twombly, supra, at 555). The fallacy of the ma\u00ad\njority\u2019s position, however, lies in looking at the relevant\nassertions in isolation. The complaint contains specific\nallegations that, in the aftermath of the September 11\nattacks, the Chief of the FBI\u2019s International Terrorism\nOperations Section and the Assistant Special Agent in\nCharge for the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office implemented a\npolicy that discriminated against Arab Muslim men, in\u00ad\ncluding Iqbal, solely on account of their race, religion, or\nnational origin. See Complaint \u00b6\u00b647\u201353, App. to Pet. for\nCert. 164a\u2013165a. Viewed in light of these subsidiary\nallegations, the allegations singled out by the majority as\n\u201cconclusory\u201d are no such thing. Iqbal\u2019s claim is not that\nAshcroft and Mueller \u201cknew of, condoned, and willfully\nand maliciously agreed to subject\u201d him to a discriminatory\npractice that is left undefined; his allegation is that \u201cthey\nknew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to\nsubject\u201d him to a particular, discrete, discriminatory policy\ndetailed in the complaint. Iqbal does not say merely that\nAshcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimina\u00ad\ntion, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-defined\nconstitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to\ncreate the discriminatory policy he has described. Taking\nthe complaint as a whole, it gives Ashcroft and Mueller\n\u201c \u2018fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

S. 41, 47 (1957) (omission in\noriginal)).\n   That aside, the majority\u2019s holding that the statements it\nselects are conclusory cannot be squared with its treat\u00ad\nment of certain other allegations in the complaint as non\u00ad\nconclusory. For example, the majority takes as true the\nstatement that \u201c[t]he policy of holding post-September\u00ad\n11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confine\u00ad\nment until they were \u2018cleared\u2019 by the FBI was approved by\nDefendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in\nthe weeks after September 11, 2001.\u201d Complaint \u00b669,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 168a; see ante, at 17. This statement\nmakes two points: (1) after September 11, the FBI held\ncertain detainees in highly restrictive conditions, and (2)\nAshcroft and Mueller discussed and approved these condi\u00ad\ntions. If, as the majority says, these allegations are not\nconclusory, then I cannot see why the majority deems it\nmerely conclusory when Iqbal alleges that (1) after Sep\u00ad\ntember 11, the FBI designated Arab Muslim detainees as\nbeing of \u201c \u2018high interest\u2019 \u201d \u201cbecause of the race, religion, and\nnational origin of the detainees, and not because of any\nevidence of the detainees\u2019 involvement in supporting\nterrorist activity,\u201d Complaint \u00b6\u00b648\u201350, App. to Pet. for\nCert. 164a, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller \u201cknew of, con\u00ad\ndoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed\u201d to that dis\u00ad\ncrimination, id., \u00b696, at 172a. By my lights, there is no\nprincipled basis for the majority\u2019s disregard of the allega\u00ad\ntions linking Ashcroft and Mueller to their subordinates\u2019\ndiscrimination.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

But I cannot find in that need\nadequate justification for the Court\u2019s interpretation of Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U. S. 544 (2007), and\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The law, after all,\nprovides trial courts with other legal weapons designed to\nprevent unwarranted interference. As the Second Circuit\nexplained, where a Government defendant asserts a quali\nfied immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for man\naging a case and \u201cmindful of the need to vindicate the\npurpose of the qualified immunity defense,\u201d can structure\ndiscovery in ways that diminish the risk of imposing un\nwarranted burdens upon public officials. See Iqbal v.\nHasty, 490 F.3d 143, 158 (2007). A district court, for\nexample, can begin discovery with lower level government\ndefendants before determining whether a case can be\nmade to allow discovery related to higher level govern\nment officials. See ibid. Neither the briefs nor the Court\u2019s\nopinion provides convincing grounds for finding these\nalternative case-management tools inadequate, either in\ngeneral or in the case before us.

Loeb, Sarang Vijay Damle, Washington, D.C., for Petitioners.</p>\n<p>Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Respondent Javaid Iqbal is a citizen of Pakistan and a Muslim. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on criminal charges and detained by federal officials. Respondent claims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while in federal custody. To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent filed a complaint against numerous federal officials, including John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States, and Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in the case now before us. As to these two petitioners, the complaint alleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected respondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>In the District Court petitioners raised the defense of qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit, contending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim against them. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite petitioners' official status at the times in question. Petitioners brought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The court, without discussion, assumed it had jurisdiction over the order denying the motion to dismiss; and it affirmed the District Court's decision.</p>\n<p>Respondent's account of his prison ordeal could, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some governmental actors. But the allegations and pleadings with respect to these actors are not before us here. This case instead turns on a narrower question: Did respondent, as the plaintiff in the District Court, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1943</span> plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states a claim that petitioners deprived him of his clearly established constitutional rights. We hold respondent's pleadings are insufficient.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Following the 2001 attacks, the FBI and other entities within the Department of Justice began an investigation of vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent them from attacking anew. The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special agents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor. By September 18 \"the FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from the public.\" Dept. of Justice, Office of Inspector General, The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks 1, 11-12 (Apr.2003) (hereinafter OIG Report), http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/ 0306/ full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0 &amp; bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf (as visited May 14, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).</p>\n<p>In the ensuing months the FBI questioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the attacks in particular or to terrorism in general. <i>Id.,</i> at 1. Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges; and a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be \"of `high interest'\" to the investigation. <i>Id.,</i> at 111. The high-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions designed to prevent them from communicating with the general prison population or the outside world. <i>Id.,</i> at 112-113.</p>\n<p>Respondent was one of the detainees. According to his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of fraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to defraud the United States. <i>Iqbal v.

Pending trial for those crimes, respondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York. Respondent was designated a person \"of high interest\" to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was placed in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU). <i>Id.,</i> at 148. As the facility's name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum security conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison regulations. <i>Ibid.</i> ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in lockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their cells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer escort. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, served a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his native Pakistan. <i>Id.,</i> at 149. He then filed a <i>Bivens</i> action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against 34 current and former federal officials and 19 \"John Doe\" federal corrections officers.

The defendants range from the correctional officers who had day-to-day contact with respondent during the term of his confinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way to petitioners\u0097officials who were at the highest level of the federal law enforcement hierarchy. First Amended Complaint in No. 04-CV-1809 (JG)(JA), \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (hereinafter Complaint).</p>\n<p>The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not challenge respondent's arrest or his confinement in the MDC's general prison population. Rather, it concentrates on his <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1944</span> treatment while confined to the ADMAX SHU. The complaint sets forth various claims against defendants who are not before us. For instance, the complaint alleges that respondent's jailors \"kicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across\" his cell without justification, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a; subjected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when he posed no safety risk to himself or others, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 143-145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and other Muslims pray because there would be \"[n]o prayers for terrorists,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a.</p>\n<p>The allegations against petitioners are the only ones relevant here. The complaint contends that petitioners designated respondent a person of high interest on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. The complaint alleges that \"the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 47, at 164a. It further alleges that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 69, at 168a. Lastly, the complaint posits that petitioners \"each knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" respondent to harsh conditions of confinement \"as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a-173a. The pleading names Ashcroft as the \"principal architect\" of the policy, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 10, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as \"instrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 11, at 157a.</p>\n<p>Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state sufficient allegations to show their own involvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct. The District Court denied their motion. Accepting all of the allegations in respondent's complaint as true, the court held that \"it cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which [respondent] would be entitled to relief as against\" petitioners. <i>Id.,</i> at 136a-137a (relying on <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957)). Invoking the collateral-order doctrine petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While that appeal was pending, this Court decided <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), which discussed the standard for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals considered <i>Twombly'</i>s applicability to this case. Acknowledging that <i>Twombly</i> retired the <i>Conley</i> no-set-of-facts test relied upon by the District Court, the Court of Appeals' opinion discussed at length how to apply this Court's \"standard for assessing the adequacy of pleadings.\" 490 F.3d, at 155. It concluded that <i>Twombly</i> called for a \"flexible `plausibility standard,' which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to render the claim <i>plausible.</i>\" <i>Id.,</i> at 157-158. The court found that petitioners' appeal did not present one of \"those contexts\" requiring amplification. As a consequence, it held respondent's pleading adequate to allege petitioners' personal involvement in discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law. <i>Id.,</i> at 174.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1945</span> Judge Cabranes concurred. He agreed that the majority's \"discussion of the relevant pleading standards reflect[ed] the uneasy compromise . . . between a qualified immunity privilege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of government as contemplated by our constitutional structure and the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 178 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Judge Cabranes nonetheless expressed concern at the prospect of subjecting high-ranking Government officials\u0097entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity and charged with responding to \"a national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic\"\u0097to the burdens of discovery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific as respondent's. <i>Id.,</i> at 179. Reluctant to vindicate that concern as a member of the Court of Appeals, <i>ibid.,</i> Judge Cabranes urged this Court to address the appropriate pleading standard \"at the earliest opportunity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 178. We granted certiorari, 554 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2931, 171 L.Ed.2d 863 (2008), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>We first address whether the Court of Appeals had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss. Respondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue. We are not free to pretermit the question. Subjectmatter jurisdiction cannot be forfeited or waived and should be considered when fairly in doubt. <i>Arbaugh v.

Under the collateral-order doctrine a limited set of district-court orders are reviewable \"though short of final judgment.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The orders within this narrow category \"are immediately appealable because they `finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.'\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Cohen v.

Provided it \"turns on an issue of law,\" <i>id.,</i> at 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, a district-court order denying qualified immunity \"`conclusively determine[s]'\" that the defendant must bear the burdens of discovery; is \"conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff's claim\"; and would prove \"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 527-528 (citing <i>Cohen, supra,</i> at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221). As a general matter, the collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits dictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the criteria set out in <i>Cohen.</i> But the applicability of the doctrine in the context of qualified-immunity claims is well established; and this Court has been careful to say that a district court's order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a \"final decision\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1291. <i>Behrens,</i> 516 U.S., at 307, 116 S.Ct. 834.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Applying these principles, we conclude that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear petitioners' appeal. The District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and rejected the defense of qualified immunity. It was therefore a final decision \"subject to immediate appeal.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Respondent says that \"a qualified immunity appeal based solely on the complaint's failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate issues relevant to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a proper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.\" Brief for Respondent Iqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief). In other words, respondent contends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether his complaint avers a clearly established constitutional violation but that it lacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his pleadings. Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate jurisdiction is not so strictly confined.</p>\n<p>In <i>Hartman v. Moore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145662\"><a href=\"/opinion/145662/hartman-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct. 1695, 164 L.Ed.2d 441 (2006), the Court reviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified immunity. The legal issue decided in <i>Hartman</i> concerned the elements a plaintiff \"must plead and prove in order to win\" a First Amendment retaliation claim. <i>Id.,</i> at 257, n. 5, 126 S.Ct. 1695. Similarly, two Terms ago in <i>Wilkie v. Robbins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145705\"><a href=\"/opinion/145705/wilkie-v-robbins/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 2588, 168 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007), the Court considered another interlocutory order denying qualified immunity. The legal issue there was whether a <i>Bivens</i> action can be employed to challenge interference with property rights. 551 U.S., at 549, n. 4, 127 S.Ct. 2588. These cases cannot be squared with respondent's argument that the collateralorder doctrine restricts appellate jurisdiction to the \"ultimate issu[e]\" whether the legal wrong asserted was a violation of clearly established law while excluding the question whether the facts pleaded establish such a violation. Iqbal Brief 15. Indeed, the latter question is even more clearly within the category of appealable decisions than the questions presented in <i>Hartman</i> and <i>Wilkie,</i> since whether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded. In that sense the sufficiency of respondent's pleadings is both \"inextricably intertwined with,\" <i>Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117906\"><a href=\"/opinion/117906/swint-v-chambers-county-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995), and \"directly implicated by,\" <i>Hartman, supra,</i> at 257, n. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1947</span> 5, 126 S.Ct. 1695, the qualified immunity defense.</p>\n<p>Respondent counters that our holding in <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238, confirms the want of subjectmatter jurisdiction here. That is incorrect. The allegation in <i>Johnson</i> was that five defendants, all of them police officers, unlawfully beat the plaintiff. <i>Johnson</i> considered \"the appealability of a portion of\" the District Court's summary judgment order that, \"though entered in a `qualified immunity' case, determine[d] only\" that there was a genuine issue of material fact that three of the defendants participated in the beating. <i>Id.,</i> at 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p>In finding that order not a \"final decision\" for purposes of \u00a7 1291, the <i>Johnson</i> Court cited <i>Mitchell</i> for the proposition that only decisions turning \"`<i>on an issue of law'\"</i> are subject to immediate appeal. 515 U.S., at 313, 115 S.Ct. 2151. Though determining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary judgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits near the law-fact divide. Or as we said in <i>Johnson,</i> it is a \"factrelated\" legal inquiry. <i>Id.,</i> at 314, 115 S.Ct. 2151. To conduct it, a court of appeals may be required to consult a \"vast pretrial record, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. That process generally involves matters more within a district court's ken and may replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal following final judgment. <i>Ibid.</i> Finding those concerns predominant, <i>Johnson</i> held that the collateral orders that are \"final\" under <i>Mitchell</i> turn on \"abstract,\" rather than \"fact-based,\" issues of law. 515 U.S., at 317, 115 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p>The concerns that animated the decision in <i>Johnson</i> are absent when an appellate court considers the disposition of a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings. True, the categories of \"factbased\" and \"abstract\" legal questions used to guide the Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i> are not well defined. Here, however, the order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss falls well within the latter class. Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals considered only the allegations contained within the four corners of respondent's complaint; resort to a \"vast pretrial record\" on petitioners' motion to dismiss was unnecessary. <i>Id.,</i> at 316, 115 S.Ct. 2151. And determining whether respondent's complaint has the \"heft\" to state a claim is a task well within an appellate court's core competency. <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint is not a \"fact-based\" question of law, so the problem the Court sought to avoid in <i>Johnson</i> is not implicated here. The District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine over which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has, jurisdiction. We proceed to consider the merits of petitioners' appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>In <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 553-554, 127 S.Ct. 1955, the Court found it necessary first to discuss the antitrust principles implicated by the complaint. Here too we begin by taking note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p>In <i>Bivens</i>\u0097proceeding on the theory that a right suggests a remedy\u0097this Court \"recognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen's constitutional rights.\" <i>Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118466\"><a href=\"/opinion/118466/correctional-services-corp-v-malesko/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 66, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1948</span> (2001). Because implied causes of action are disfavored, the Court has been reluctant to extend <i>Bivens</i> liability \"to any new context or new category of defendants.\" 534 U.S., at 68, 122 S.Ct. 515. See also <i>Wilkie,</i> 551 U.S., at 549-550, 127 S.Ct. 2588. That reluctance might well have disposed of respondent's First Amendment claim of religious discrimination. For while we have allowed a <i>Bivens</i> action to redress a violation of the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, see <i>Davis v. Passman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979), we have not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise Clause. Indeed, we have declined to extend <i>Bivens</i> to a claim sounding in the First Amendment. <i>Bush v. Lucas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110965\"><a href=\"/opinion/110965/bush-v-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span>, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983). Petitioners do not press this argument, however, so we assume, without deciding, that respondent's First Amendment claim is actionable under <i>Bivens.</i></p>\n<p>In the limited settings where <i>Bivens</i> does apply, the implied cause of action is the \"federal analog to suits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\" <i>Hartman,</i> 547 U.S., at 254, n. 2, 126 S.Ct. 1695. Cf. <i>Wilson v.

Based on the rules our precedents establish, respondent correctly concedes that Government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of <i>respondeat superior.</i> Iqbal Brief 46 (\"[I]t is undisputed that supervisory <i>Bivens</i> liability cannot be established solely on a theory of <i>respondeat superior</i>\").

Munroe,</i> 7 Cranch 242, 269, 3 L.Ed. 329 (1812) (a federal official's liability \"will only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge\" of his subordinates' duties); <i>Robertson v.

Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to <i>Bivens</i> and \u00a7 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Governmentofficial defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The factors necessary to establish a <i>Bivens</i> violation will vary with the constitutional provision at issue. Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose. <i>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 540-541, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993) (First Amendment); <i>Washington v.

Under extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than \"intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.\" <i>Personnel Administrator of Mass. v.

It instead involves a decisionmaker's undertaking a course of action \"`because of,' not merely `in spite of,' [the action's] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead sufficient factual matter to show that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1949</span> petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>Respondent disagrees. He argues that, under a theory of \"supervisory liability,\" petitioners can be liable for \"knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates' use of discriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among detainees.\" Iqbal Brief 45-46. That is to say, respondent believes a supervisor's mere knowledge of his subordinate's discriminatory purpose amounts to the supervisor's violating the Constitution. We reject this argument. Respondent's conception of \"supervisory liability\" is inconsistent with his accurate stipulation that petitioners may not be held accountable for the misdeeds of their agents. In a \u00a7 1983 suit or a <i>Bivens</i> action\u0097where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants\u0097the term \"supervisory liability\" is a misnomer. Absent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct. In the context of determining whether there is a violation of clearly established right to overcome qualified immunity, purpose rather than knowledge is required to impose <i>Bivens</i> liability on the subordinate for unconstitutional discrimination; the same holds true for an official charged with violations arising from his or her superintendent responsibilities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>We turn to respondent's complaint. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" As the Court held in <i>Twombly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require \"detailed factual allegations,\" but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. <i>Id.,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (citing <i>Papasan v. Allain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111742\"><a href=\"/opinion/111742/papasan-v-allain/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986)). A pleading that offers \"labels and conclusions\" or \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\" 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \"naked assertion[s]\" devoid of \"further factual enhancement.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. <i>Id.,</i> at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955. The plausibility standard is not akin to a \"probability requirement,\" but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. <i>Ibid.</i> Where a complaint pleads facts that are \"merely consistent with\" a defendant's liability, it \"stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p>Two working principles underlie our decision in <i>Twombly.</i> First, the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. <i>Id.,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (Although for the purposes of a motion to dismiss we must take all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true, we <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1950</span> \"are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Rule 8 marks a notable and generous departure from the hyper-technical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions. Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss. <i>Id.,</i> at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will, as the Court of Appeals observed, be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. 490 F.3d, at 157-158. But where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged\u0097but it has not \"show[n]\"\u0097\"that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p>In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by factual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> illustrates the two-pronged approach. There, we considered the sufficiency of a complaint alleging that incumbent telecommunications providers had entered an agreement not to compete and to forestall competitive entry, in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. Recognizing that \u00a7 1 enjoins only anticompetitive conduct \"effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy,\" <i>Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111218\"><a href=\"/opinion/111218/copperweld-corp-v-independence-tube-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span>, 775, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984), the plaintiffs in <i>Twombly</i> flatly pleaded that the defendants \"ha[d] entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry. . . and ha[d] agreed not to compete with one another.\" 550 U.S., at 551, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (internal quotation marks omitted). The complaint also alleged that the defendants' \"parallel course of conduct . . . to prevent competition\" and inflate prices was indicative of the unlawful agreement alleged. <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The Court held the plaintiffs' complaint deficient under Rule 8. In doing so it first noted that the plaintiffs' assertion of an unlawful agreement was a \"`legal conclusion'\" and, as such, was not entitled to the assumption of truth. <i>Id.,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Had the Court simply credited the allegation of a conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and been entitled to proceed perforce. The Court next addressed the \"nub\" of the plaintiffs' complaint\u0097the well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegation of parallel behavior\u0097to determine whether it gave rise to a \"plausible suggestion of conspiracy.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 565-566, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Acknowledging that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agreement, the Court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausibly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compatible with, but indeed was more likely explained by, lawful, unchoreographed free-market behavior. <i>Id.,</i> at 567, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Because the well-pleaded fact of parallel conduct, accepted as true, did not plausibly suggest an unlawful agreement, the Court held the plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed. <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Under <i>Twombly</i>'s construction of Rule 8, we conclude that respondent's complaint <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1951</span> has not \"nudged [his] claims\" of invidious discrimination \"across the line from conceivable to plausible.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth. Respondent pleads that petitioners \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]\" to harsh conditions of confinement \"as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" Complaint \u00b6 96, App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a-174a. The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was the \"principal architect\" of this invidious policy, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 10, at 157a, and that Mueller was \"instrumental\" in adopting and executing it, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 11, at 157a. These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly,</i> amount to nothing more than a \"formulaic recitation of the elements\" of a constitutional discrimination claim, 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, namely, that petitioners adopted a policy \"`because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\" <i>Feeney,</i> 442 U.S., at 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282. As such, the allegations are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. <i>Twombly, supra,</i> 550 U.S., at 554-555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical. We do not so characterize them any more than the Court in <i>Twombly</i> rejected the plaintiffs' express allegation of a \"`contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,'\" <i>id.,</i> at 551, 127 S.Ct. 1955, because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained. It is the conclusory nature of respondent's allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.</p>\n<p>We next consider the factual allegations in respondent's complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief. The complaint alleges that \"the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11.\" Complaint \u00b6 47, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a. It further claims that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 69, at 168a. Taken as true, these allegations are consistent with petitioners' purposefully designating detainees \"of high interest\" because of their race, religion, or national origin. But given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose.</p>\n<p>The September 11 attacks were perpetrated by 19 Arab Muslim hijackers who counted themselves members in good standing of al Qaeda, an Islamic fundamentalist group. Al Qaeda was headed by another Arab Muslim\u0097Osama bin Laden\u0097and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disciples. It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the purpose of the policy was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims. On the facts respondent alleges the arrests Mueller oversaw were likely lawful and justified by his nondiscriminatory intent to detain aliens who were illegally present in the United States and who had potential connections to those who committed terrorist acts. As between that \"obvious alternative explanation\" for the arrests, <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 567, 127 S.Ct. 1955, and the purposeful, invidious discrimination respondent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1952</span> asks us to infer, discrimination is not a plausible conclusion.</p>\n<p>But even if the complaint's well-pleaded facts give rise to a plausible inference that respondent's arrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that inference alone would not entitle respondent to relief. It is important to recall that respondent's complaint challenges neither the constitutionality of his arrest nor his initial detention in the MDC. Respondent's constitutional claims against petitioners rest solely on their ostensible \"policy of holding post-September-11th detainees\" in the ADMAX SHU once they were categorized as \"of high interest.\" Complaint \u00b6 69, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a. To prevail on that theory, the complaint must contain facts plausibly showing that petitioners purposefully adopted a policy of classifying post-September-11 detainees as \"of high interest\" because of their race, religion, or national origin.</p>\n<p>This the complaint fails to do. Though respondent alleges that various other defendants, who are not before us, may have labeled him a person of \"of high interest\" for impermissible reasons, his only factual allegation against petitioners accuses them of adopting a policy approving \"restrictive conditions of confinement\" for post-September-11 detainees until they were \"`cleared' by the FBI.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Accepting the truth of that allegation, the complaint does not show, or even intimate, that petitioners purposefully housed detainees in the ADMAX SHU due to their race, religion, or national origin. All it plausibly suggests is that the Nation's top law enforcement officers, in the aftermath of a devastating terrorist attack, sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity. Respondent does not argue, nor can he, that such a motive would violate petitioners' constitutional obligations. He would need to allege more by way of factual content to \"nudg[e]\" his claim of purposeful discrimination \"across the line from conceivable to plausible.\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>To be sure, respondent can attempt to draw certain contrasts between the pleadings the Court considered in <i>Twombly</i> and the pleadings at issue here. In <i>Twombly,</i> the complaint alleged general wrongdoing that extended over a period of years, <i>id.,</i> at 551, 127 S.Ct. 1955, whereas here the complaint alleges discrete wrongs\u0097for instance, beatings\u0097by lower level Government actors. The allegations here, if true, and if condoned by petitioners, could be the basis for some inference of wrongful intent on petitioners' part. Despite these distinctions, respondent's pleadings do not suffice to state a claim. Unlike in <i>Twombly,</i> where the doctrine of <i>respondeat superior</i> could bind the corporate defendant, here, as we have noted, petitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic. Yet respondent's complaint does not contain any factual allegation sufficient to plausibly suggest petitioners' discriminatory state of mind. His pleadings thus do not meet the standard necessary to comply with Rule 8.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that we express no opinion concerning the sufficiency of respondent's complaint against the defendants who are not before us. Respondent's account of his prison ordeal alleges serious official misconduct that we need not address here. Our decision is limited to the determination that respondent's complaint does not entitle him to relief from petitioners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Respondent offers three arguments that bear on our disposition of his case, but none is persuasive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1953</span> 1</h2>\n<p>Respondent first says that our decision in <i>Twombly</i> should be limited to pleadings made in the context of an antitrust dispute. Iqbal Brief 37-38. This argument is not supported by <i>Twombly</i> and is incompatible with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Though <i>Twombly</i> determined the sufficiency of a complaint sounding in antitrust, the decision was based on our interpretation and application of Rule 8. 550 U.S., at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955. That Rule in turn governs the pleading standard \"in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts.\" Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 1. Our decision in <i>Twombly</i> expounded the pleading standard for \"all civil actions,\" <i>ibid.,</i> and it applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike. See 550 U.S., at 555-556, and n. 3, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Respondent next implies that our construction of Rule 8 should be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals has \"instructed the district court to cabin discovery in such a way as to preserve\" petitioners' defense of qualified immunity \"as much as possible in anticipation of a summary judgment motion.\" Iqbal Brief 27. We have held, however, that the question presented by a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed upon the discovery process. <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 559, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (\"It is no answer to say that a claim just shy of a plausible entitlement to relief can, if groundless, be weeded out early in the discovery process through careful case management given the common lament that the success of judicial supervision in checking discovery abuse has been on the modest side\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p>Our rejection of the careful-case-management approach is especially important in suits where Government-official defendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity. The basic thrust of the qualified-immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation, including \"avoidance of disruptive discovery.\" <i>Siegert v. Gilley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112594\"><a href=\"/opinion/112594/siegert-v-gilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 236, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). There are serious and legitimate reasons for this. If a Government official is to devote time to his or her duties, and to the formulation of sound and responsible policies, it is counterproductive to require the substantial diversion that is attendant to participating in litigation and making informed decisions as to how it should proceed. Litigation, though necessary to ensure that officials comply with the law, exacts heavy costs in terms of efficiency and expenditure of valuable time and resources that might otherwise be directed to the proper execution of the work of the Government. The costs of diversion are only magnified when Government officials are charged with responding to, as Judge Cabranes aptly put it, \"a national and international security emergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic.\" 490 F.3d, at 179.</p>\n<p>It is no answer to these concerns to say that discovery for petitioners can be deferred while pretrial proceedings continue for other defendants. It is quite likely that, when discovery as to the other parties proceeds, it would prove necessary for petitioners and their counsel to participate in the process to ensure the case does not develop in a misleading or slanted way that causes prejudice to their position. Even if petitioners are not yet themselves subject to discovery orders, then, they would not be free from the burdens of discovery.</p>\n<p>We decline respondent's invitation to relax the pleading requirements on the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1954</span> ground that the Court of Appeals promises petitioners minimally intrusive discovery. That promise provides especially cold comfort in this pleading context, where we are impelled to give real content to the concept of qualified immunity for high-level officials who must be neither deterred nor detracted from the vigorous performance of their duties. Because respondent's complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Respondent finally maintains that the Federal Rules expressly allow him to allege petitioners' discriminatory intent \"generally,\" which he equates with a conclusory allegation. Iqbal Brief 32 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 9). It follows, respondent says, that his complaint is sufficiently well pleaded because it claims that petitioners discriminated against him \"on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" Complaint \u00b6 96, App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a-173a. Were we required to accept this allegation as true, respondent's complaint would survive petitioners' motion to dismiss. But the Federal Rules do not require courts to credit a complaint's conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.</p>\n<p>It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when pleading \"fraud or mistake,\" while allowing \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind [to] be alleged generally.\" But \"generally\" is a relative term. In the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement applicable to fraud or mistake. Rule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent under an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license to evade the less rigid\u0097though still operative\u0097strictures of Rule 8. See 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1301, p. 291 (3d ed. 2004) (\"[A] rigid rule requiring the detailed pleading of a condition of mind would be undesirable because, absent overriding considerations pressing for a specificity requirement, as in the case of averments of fraud or mistake, the general `short and plain statement of the claim' mandate in Rule 8(a). . . should control the second sentence of Rule 9(b)\"). And Rule 8 does not empower respondent to plead the bare elements of his cause of action, affix the label \"general allegation,\" and expect his complaint to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>We hold that respondent's complaint fails to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful discrimination against petitioners. The Court of Appeals should decide in the first instance whether to remand to the District Court so that respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient complaint.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG, and Justice BREYER join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case is here on the uncontested assumption that <i>Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), allows personal liability based on a federal officer's violation of an individual's rights under the First and Fifth Amendments, and it comes to us with the explicit concession of petitioners Ashcroft and Mueller that an officer may be subject to <i>Bivens</i> liability as a supervisor on grounds other than <i>respondeat</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1955</span> <i>superior.</i> The Court apparently rejects this concession and, although it has no bearing on the majority's resolution of this case, does away with supervisory liability under <i>Bivens.</i> The majority then misapplies the pleading standard under <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), to conclude that the complaint fails to state a claim. I respectfully dissent from both the rejection of supervisory liability as a cognizable claim in the face of petitioners' concession, and from the holding that the complaint fails to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Respondent Iqbal was arrested in November 2001 on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States and fraud in relation to identification documents, and was placed in pretrial detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. <i>Iqbal v. Hasty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798076\"><a href=\"/opinion/798076/javaid-iqbal-v-dennis-hasty-former-warden-of-the-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 147-148 (C.A.2 2007). He alleges that FBI officials carried out a discriminatory policy by designating him as a person \"`of high interest'\" in the investigation of the September 11 attacks solely because of his race, religion, or national origin. Owing to this designation he was placed in the detention center's Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit for over six months while awaiting the fraud trial. <i>Id.,</i> at 148. As I will mention more fully below, Iqbal contends that Ashcroft and Mueller were at the very least aware of the discriminatory detention policy and condoned it (and perhaps even took part in devising it), thereby violating his First and Fifth Amendment rights.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Iqbal claims that on the day he was transferred to the special unit, prison guards, without provocation, \"picked him up and threw him against the wall, kicked him in the stomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across the room.\" First Amended Complaint in No. 04-CV-1809 (JG)(JA), \u00b6 113, App. to Pet. for Cert. 176a (hereinafter Complaint). He says that after being attacked a second time he sought medical attention but was denied care for two weeks. <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 187-188, at 189a. According to Iqbal's complaint, prison staff in the special unit subjected him to unjustified strip and body cavity searches, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 136-140, at 181a, verbally berated him as a \"`terrorist'\" and \"`Muslim killer,'\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 87, at 170a-171a, refused to give him adequate food, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 91, at 171a-172a, and intentionally turned on air conditioning during the winter and heating during the summer, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 84, at 170a. He claims that prison staff interfered with his attempts to pray and engage in religious study, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 153-154, at 183a-184a, and with his access to counsel, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 168, 171, at 186a-187a.</p>\n<p>The District Court denied Ashcroft and Mueller's motion to dismiss Iqbal's discrimination claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Ashcroft and Mueller then asked this Court to grant certiorari on two questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\"1. Whether a conclusory allegation that a cabinet-level officer or other highranking official knew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts purportedly committed by subordinate officials is sufficient to state individual-capacity claims against those officials under <i>Bivens.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*1956</span> \"2. Whether a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official may be held personally liable for the allegedly unconstitutional acts of subordinate officials on the ground that, as high-level supervisors, they had constructive notice of the discrimination allegedly carried out by such subordinate officials.\" Pet. for Cert. I.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court granted certiorari on both questions. The first is about pleading; the second goes to the liability standard.</p>\n<p>In the first question, Ashcroft and Mueller did not ask whether \"a cabinet-level officer or other high-ranking official\" who \"knew of, condoned, or agreed to subject a plaintiff to allegedly unconstitutional acts committed by subordinate officials\" was subject to liability under <i>Bivens.</i> In fact, they conceded in their petition for certiorari that they would be liable if they had \"actual knowledge\" of discrimination by their subordinates and exhibited \"`deliberate indifference'\" to that discrimination. Pet. for Cert. 29 (quoting <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span>, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). Instead, they asked the Court to address whether Iqbal's allegations against them (which they call conclusory) were sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2), and in particular whether the Court of Appeals misapplied our decision in <i>Twombly</i> construing that rule. Pet. for Cert. 11-24.</p>\n<p>In the second question, Ashcroft and Mueller asked this Court to say whether they could be held personally liable for the actions of their subordinates based on the theory that they had constructive notice of their subordinates' unconstitutional conduct. <i>Id.,</i> at 25-33. This was an odd question to pose, since Iqbal has never claimed that Ashcroft and Mueller are liable on a constructive notice theory. Be that as it may, the second question challenged only one possible ground for imposing supervisory liability under <i>Bivens.</i> In sum, both questions assumed that a defendant could raise a <i>Bivens</i> claim on theories of supervisory liability other than constructive notice, and neither question asked the parties or the Court to address the elements of such liability.</p>\n<p>The briefing at the merits stage was no different. Ashcroft and Mueller argued that the factual allegations in Iqbal's complaint were insufficient to overcome their claim of qualified immunity; they also contended that they could not be held liable on a theory of constructive notice. Again they conceded, however, that they would be subject to supervisory liability if they \"had actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being `of high interest' and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\" Brief for Petitioners 50; see also Reply Brief for Petitioners 21-22. Iqbal argued that the allegations in his complaint were sufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) and <i>Twombly,</i> and conceded that as a matter of law he could not recover under a theory of <i>respondeat superior.</i> See Brief for Respondent Iqbal 46. Thus, the parties agreed as to a proper standard of supervisory liability, and the disputed question was whether Iqbal's complaint satisfied Rule 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p>Without acknowledging the parties' agreement as to the standard of supervisory liability, the Court asserts that it must <i>sua sponte</i> decide the scope of supervisory liability here. <i>Ante,</i> at 1947-1949. I agree that, absent Ashcroft and Mueller's concession, that determination would have to be made; without knowing the elements of a supervisory liability claim, there would be no way to determine whether a plaintiff had made factual allegations amounting to grounds for relief on that claim. See <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 557-558, 127 S.Ct. 1955. But deciding the scope of supervisory <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1957</span> <i>Bivens</i> liability in this case is uncalled for. There are several reasons, starting with the position Ashcroft and Mueller have taken and following from it.</p>\n<p>First, Ashcroft and Mueller have, as noted, made the critical concession that a supervisor's knowledge of a subordinate's unconstitutional conduct and deliberate indifference to that conduct are grounds for <i>Bivens</i> liability. Iqbal seeks to recover on a theory that Ashcroft and Mueller at least knowingly acquiesced (and maybe more than acquiesced) in the discriminatory acts of their subordinates; if he can show this, he will satisfy Ashcroft and Mueller's own test for supervisory liability. See <i>Farmer, supra,</i> at 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (explaining that a prison official acts with \"deliberate indifference\" if \"the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm\"). We do not normally override a party's concession, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States v. International Business Machines Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118038\"><a href=\"/opinion/118038/united-states-v-international-business-machines-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span>, 855, 116 S.Ct. 1793, 135 L.Ed.2d 124 (1996) (holding that \"[i]t would be inappropriate for us to [e]xamine in this case, without the benefit of the parties' briefing,\" an issue the Government had conceded), and doing so is especially inappropriate when, as here, the issue is unnecessary to decide the case, see <i>infra,</i> at 1958-1959. I would therefore accept Ashcroft and Mueller's concession for purposes of this case and proceed to consider whether the complaint alleges at least knowledge and deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p>Second, because of the concession, we have received no briefing or argument on the proper scope of supervisory liability, much less the full-dress argument we normally require. <i>Mapp v. Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106285\"><a href=\"/opinion/106285/mapp-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span>, 676-677, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting). We consequently are in no position to decide the precise contours of supervisory liability here, this issue being a complicated one that has divided the Courts of Appeals. See <i>infra,</i> at 1957-1959. This Court recently remarked on the danger of \"bad decisionmaking\" when the briefing on a question is \"woefully inadequate,\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> 555 U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 819, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009), yet today the majority answers a question with no briefing at all. The attendant risk of error is palpable.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court's approach is most unfair to Iqbal. He was entitled to rely on Ashcroft and Mueller's concession, both in their petition for certiorari and in their merits briefs, that they could be held liable on a theory of knowledge and deliberate indifference. By overriding that concession, the Court denies Iqbal a fair chance to be heard on the question.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>The majority, however, does ignore the concession. According to the majority, because Iqbal concededly cannot recover on a theory of <i>respondeat superior,</i> it follows that he cannot recover under any theory of supervisory liability. <i>Ante,</i> at 1948-1949. The majority says that in a <i>Bivens</i> action, \"where masters do not answer for the torts of their servants,\" \"the term `supervisory liability' is a misnomer,\" and that \"[a]bsent vicarious liability, each Government official, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Lest there be any mistake, in these words the majority is not narrowing the scope of supervisory liability; it is eliminating <i>Bivens</i> supervisory liability entirely. The nature of a supervisory liability theory is that the supervisor may be liable, under certain conditions, for the wrongdoing of his subordinates, and it is this very principle that the majority rejects. <i>Ante,</i> at 1952 (\"[P]etitioners cannot be held liable unless they themselves <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1958</span> acted on account of a constitutionally protected characteristic\").</p>\n<p>The dangers of the majority's readiness to proceed without briefing and argument are apparent in its cursory analysis, which rests on the assumption that only two outcomes are possible here: <i>respondeat superior</i> liability, in which \"an employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees while acting within the scope of their employment,\" Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.04 (2005), or no supervisory liability at all. The dichotomy is false. Even if an employer is not liable for the actions of his employee solely because the employee was acting within the scope of employment, there still might be conditions to render a supervisor liable for the conduct of his subordinate. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Whitfield v. Melendez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201947\"><a href=\"/opinion/201947/whitfield-v-melendez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 (C.A.1 2005) (distinguishing between <i>respondeat superior</i> liability and supervisory liability); <i>Bennett v.

Monroe Twp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692283\"><a href=\"/opinion/692283/inez-baker-individually-and-as-guardian-ad-litem-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span>, 1194 (C.A.3 1995); <i>Woodward v.

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186179\"><a href=\"/opinion/186179/intl-actn-ctr-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 28 (C.A.D.C. 2004) (Roberts, J.)

University of Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516408\"><a href=\"/opinion/516408/annabelle-lipsett-v-university-of-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span>, 902 (C.A.1 1988). I am unsure what the general test for supervisory liability should be, and in the absence of briefing and argument I am in no position to choose or devise one.</p>\n<p>Neither is the majority, but what is most remarkable about its foray into supervisory liability is that its conclusion has no bearing on its resolution of the case. The majority says that all of the allegations in the complaint that Ashcroft and Mueller authorized, condoned, or even were aware of their subordinates' discriminatory conduct are \"conclusory\" and therefore are \"not entitled to be assumed true.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1951. As I explain below, this conclusion is unsound, but on the majority's understanding of Rule 8(a)(2) pleading standards, even if the majority accepted Ashcroft and Mueller's concession and asked whether the complaint sufficiently alleges knowledge and deliberate indifference, it presumably would still conclude that the complaint fails to plead sufficient facts and must be dismissed.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Given petitioners' concession, the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2). Ashcroft and Mueller admit they are liable for their subordinates' conduct if they \"had actual knowledge of the assertedly discriminatory nature of the classification of suspects as being `of high interest' and they were deliberately indifferent to that discrimination.\" Brief for Petitioners 50. Iqbal alleges <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1959</span> that after the September 11 attacks the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \"arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men,\" Complaint \u00b6 47, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, that many of these men were designated by high-ranking FBI officials as being \"`of high interest,'\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6\u00b6 48, 50, at 164a, and that in many cases, including Iqbal's, this designation was made \"because of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees' involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 49. The complaint further alleges that Ashcroft was the \"principal architect of the policies and practices challenged,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 10, at 157a, and that Mueller \"was instrumental in the adoption, promulgation, and implementation of the policies and practices challenged,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 11. According to the complaint, Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [Iqbal] to these conditions of confinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest.\" <i>Id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a-173a. The complaint thus alleges, at a bare minimum, that Ashcroft and Mueller knew of and condoned the discriminatory policy their subordinates carried out. Actually, the complaint goes further in alleging that Ashcroft and Muller affirmatively acted to create the discriminatory detention policy. If these factual allegations are true, Ashcroft and Mueller were, at the very least, aware of the discriminatory policy being implemented and deliberately indifferent to it.</p>\n<p>Ashcroft and Mueller argue that these allegations fail to satisfy the \"plausibility standard\" of <i>Twombly.</i> They contend that Iqbal's claims are implausible because such high-ranking officials \"tend not to be personally involved in the specific actions of lower-level officers down the bureaucratic chain of command.\" Brief for Petitioners 28. But this response bespeaks a fundamental misunderstanding of the enquiry that <i>Twombly</i> demands. <i>Twombly</i> does not require a court at the motion-to-dismiss stage to consider whether the factual allegations are probably true. We made it clear, on the contrary, that a court must take the allegations as true, no matter how skeptical the court may be. See <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (a court must proceed \"on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)\"); <i>id.,</i> at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (\"[A] well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of the facts alleged is improbable\"); see also <i>Neitzke v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112254\"><a href=\"/opinion/112254/neitzke-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989) (\"Rule 12(b)(6) does not countenance . . . dismissals based on a judge's disbelief of a complaint's factual allegations\"). The sole exception to this rule lies with allegations that are sufficiently fantastic to defy reality as we know it: claims about little green men, or the plaintiff's recent trip to Pluto, or experiences in time travel. That is not what we have here.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Twombly,</i> the relevant question is whether, assuming the factual allegations are true, the plaintiff has stated a ground for relief that is plausible. That is, in <i>Twombly</i>'s words, a plaintiff must \"allege facts\" that, taken as true, are \"suggestive of illegal conduct.\" 550 U.S., at 564, n. 8, 127 S.Ct. 1955. In <i>Twombly,</i> we were faced with allegations of a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act through parallel conduct. The difficulty was that the conduct alleged was \"consistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 554, 127 S.Ct. 1955. We held that in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1960</span> that sort of circumstance, \"[a]n allegation of parallel conduct is . . . much like a naked assertion of conspiracy in a \u00a7 1 complaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of `entitlement to relief.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (brackets omitted). Here, by contrast, the allegations in the complaint are neither confined to naked legal conclusions nor consistent with legal conduct. The complaint alleges that FBI officials discriminated against Iqbal solely on account of his race, religion, and national origin, and it alleges the knowledge and deliberate indifference that, by Ashcroft and Mueller's own admission, are sufficient to make them liable for the illegal action. Iqbal's complaint therefore contains \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>I do not understand the majority to disagree with this understanding of \"plausibility\" under <i>Twombly.</i> Rather, the majority discards the allegations discussed above with regard to Ashcroft and Mueller as conclusory, and is left considering only two statements in the complaint: that \"the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its investigation of the events of September 11,\" Complaint \u00b6 47, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001,\" <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 69, at 168a. See <i>ante,</i> at 1951. I think the majority is right in saying that these allegations suggest only that Ashcroft and Mueller \"sought to keep suspected terrorists in the most secure conditions available until the suspects could be cleared of terrorist activity,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1952, and that this produced \"a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims,\" <i>ante,</i> at 1951-1952. And I agree that the two allegations selected by the majority, standing alone, do not state a plausible entitlement to relief for unconstitutional discrimination.</p>\n<p>But these allegations do not stand alone as the only significant, nonconclusory statements in the complaint, for the complaint contains many allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to the discriminatory practices of their subordinates. See Complaint \u00b610, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (Ashcroft was the \"principal architect\" of the discriminatory policy); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 11 (Mueller was \"instrumental\" in adopting and executing the discriminatory policy); <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a-173a (Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" Iqbal to harsh conditions \"as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no legitimate penological interest\").</p>\n<p>The majority says that these are \"bare assertions\" that, \"much like the pleading of conspiracy in <i>Twombly,</i> amount to nothing more than a `formulaic recitation of the elements' of a constitutional discrimination claim\" and therefore are \"not entitled to be assumed true.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1951 (quoting <i>Twombly, supra,</i> at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955). The fallacy of the majority's position, however, lies in looking at the relevant assertions in isolation. The complaint contains specific allegations that, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the Chief of the FBI's International Terrorism Operations Section and the Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the FBI's New York Field Office implemented a policy that discriminated against Arab Muslim men, including Iqbal, solely on account of their race, religion, or national origin. See <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1961</span> Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 47-53, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a-165a. Viewed in light of these subsidiary allegations, the allegations singled out by the majority as \"conclusory\" are no such thing. Iqbal's claim is not that Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" him to a discriminatory practice that is left undefined; his allegation is that \"they knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject\" him to a particular, discrete, discriminatory policy detailed in the complaint. Iqbal does not say merely that Ashcroft was the architect of some amorphous discrimination, or that Mueller was instrumental in an ill-defined constitutional violation; he alleges that they helped to create the discriminatory policy he has described. Taking the complaint as a whole, it gives Ashcroft and Mueller \"`fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.'\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (quoting <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (omission in original)).</p>\n<p>That aside, the majority's holding that the statements it selects are conclusory cannot be squared with its treatment of certain other allegations in the complaint as nonconclusory. For example, the majority takes as true the statement that \"[t]he policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of confinement until they were `cleared' by the FBI was approved by Defendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 2001.\" Complaint \u00b6 69, App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a; see <i>ante,</i> at 1951. This statement makes two points: (1) after September 11, the FBI held certain detainees in highly restrictive conditions, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller discussed and approved these conditions. If, as the majority says, these allegations are not conclusory, then I cannot see why the majority deems it merely conclusory when Iqbal alleges that (1) after September 11, the FBI designated Arab Muslim detainees as being of \"`high interest'\" \"because of the race, religion, and national origin of the detainees, and not because of any evidence of the detainees' involvement in supporting terrorist activity,\" Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 48-50, App. to Pet. for Cert. 164a, and (2) Ashcroft and Mueller \"knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed\" to that discrimination, <i>id.,</i> \u00b6 96, at 172a. By my lights, there is no principled basis for the majority's disregard of the allegations linking Ashcroft and Mueller to their subordinates' discrimination.</p>\n<p>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>Justice BREYER, dissenting.</p>\n<p>I agree with Justice SOUTER and join his dissent. I write separately to point out that, like the Court, I believe it important to prevent unwarranted litigation from interfering with \"the proper execution of the work of the Government.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 1953. But I cannot find in that need adequate justification for the Court's interpretation of <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The law, after all, provides trial courts with other legal weapons designed to prevent unwarranted interference. As the Second Circuit explained, where a Government defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial court, responsible for managing a case and \"mindful of the need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense,\" can structure discovery in ways that diminish the risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public officials. See <i>Iqbal v. Hasty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798076\"><a href=\"/opinion/798076/javaid-iqbal-v-dennis-hasty-former-warden-of-the-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span>, 158 (2007). A district court, for example, can begin discovery with lower level government defendants before determining whether a case can be made to allow <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1962</span> discovery related to higher level government officials. See <i>ibid.</i> Neither the briefs nor the Court's opinion provides convincing grounds for finding these alternative case-management tools inadequate, either in general or in the case before us. For this reason, as well as for the independently sufficient reasons set forth in Justice SOUTER's opinion, I would affirm the Second Circuit.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Iqbal makes no claim against Ashcroft and Mueller based simply on his right, as a pretrial detainee, to be free from punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt on the fraud charges. See <i>Bell v. Wolfish,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 535, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).</p>\n<p>[2]  If I am mistaken, and the majority's rejection of the concession is somehow outcome determinative, then its approach is even more unfair to Iqbal than previously explained, see. <i>supra,</i> at 1957, for Iqbal had no reason to argue the (apparently dispositive) supervisory liability standard in light of the concession.</p>\n\n</div>",
