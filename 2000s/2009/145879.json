Argued February 24, 2009\u2014Decided May 4, 2009*\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Li\n  ability Act (CERCLA) is designed to promote the cleanup of hazard\n  ous waste sites and to ensure that cleanup costs are borne by those\n  responsible for the contamination. In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc.\n  (B&B), an agricultural chemical distributor, began operating on a\n  parcel of land located in Arvin, California. B&B later expanded onto\n  an adjacent parcel owned by petitioners Burlington Northern and\n  Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company\n  (Railroads). As part of its business, B&B purchased and stored vari\n  ous hazardous chemicals, including the pesticide D\u2013D, which it\n  bought from petitioner Shell Oil Company (Shell). Over time, many\n  of these chemicals spilled during transfers and deliveries, and as a\n  result of equipment failures.\n     Investigations of B&B by the California Department of Toxic Sub\n  stances Control and the federal Environmental Protection Agency\n  (Governments) revealed significant soil and ground water contamina\n  tion and in 1989, the Governments exercised their CERCLA author\n  ity to clean up the Arvin site, spending over $8 million by 1998.\n  Seeking to recover their costs, the Governments initiated legal action\n  against Shell and the Railroads. The District Court ruled in favor of\n  the Governments, finding that both the Railroads and Shell were po\n  tentially responsible parties under CERCLA\u2014the Railroads because\n  they owned part of the facility and Shell because it had \u201carranged for\n  disposal . . . of hazardous substances,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79607(a)(3),\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 07\u20131607, Shell Oil Co. v. United States et al., also\non certiorari to the same court.\n2         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    through D\u2013D\u2019s sale and delivery. The District Court apportioned li\n    ability, holding the Railroads liable for 9% of the Governments\u2019 total\n    response costs, and Shell liable for 6%. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\n    agreed that Shell could be held liable as an arranger under\n    \u00a79607(a)(3) and affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision in that respect.\n    Although the Court of Appeals agreed that the harm in this case was\n    theoretically capable of apportionment, it found the facts present in\n    the record insufficient to support apportionment, and therefore held\n    Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Govern\n    ments\u2019 response costs.\nHeld:\n    1. Shell is not liable as an arranger for the contamination at the\n Arvin facility. Section \u00a79607(a)(3) liability may not extend beyond\n the limits of the statute itself. Because CERCLA does not specifically\n define what it means to \u201carrang[e] for\u201d disposal of a hazardous sub\n stance, the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. In common\n parlance, \u201carrange\u201d implies action directed to a specific purpose.\n Thus, under \u00a79607(a)(3)\u2019s plain language, an entity may qualify as an\n arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous\n substance. To qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into\n D\u2013D sales with the intent that at least a portion of the product be\n disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of \u00a76903(3)\u2019s\n methods. The facts found by the District Court do not support such a\n conclusion. The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, ac\n cidental spills occurred during D\u2013D\u2019s transfer from the common car\n rier to B&B\u2019s storage tanks after the product had come under B&B\u2019s\n stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps\n to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of spills. Thus,\n Shell\u2019s mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient\n grounds for concluding that it \u201carranged for\u201d D\u2013D\u2019s disposal. Pp. 8\u2013\n 13.\n    2. The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads\u2019 share\n of the site remediation costs at 9%. Calculating liability based on\n three figures\u2014the percentage of the total area of the facility that was\n owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&B\u2019s business divided by\n the term of the Railroads\u2019 lease, and the court\u2019s determination that\n only two polluting chemicals (not D\u2013D) spilled on the leased parcel\n required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for\n roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contamination\u2014the District\n Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for\n 9% of the remediation costs. The District Court\u2019s detailed findings\n show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the fa\n cility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous\n chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the par\n  ties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount\n  of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total\n  site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each\n  chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Rail\n  road parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&B site, where\n  most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion\n  that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring\n  remediation.

S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a79601\u20139675, in response to the serious environmental\nand health risks posed by industrial pollution. See United\nStates v. Bestfoods, 524 U. S. 51, 55 (1998). The Act was\ndesigned to promote the \u201c \u2018timely cleanup of hazardous\nwaste sites\u2019 \u201d and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup\nefforts were borne by those responsible for the contamina\ntion.

CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nsite may be held responsible for the full costs of remedia\ntion.\n                                I\n   In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc. (B&B), began operating\nan agricultural chemical distribution business, purchasing\npesticides and other chemical products from suppliers\nsuch as Shell Oil Company (Shell). Using its own equip\nment, B&B applied its products to customers\u2019 farms. B&B\nopened its business on a 3.8 acre parcel of former farm\nland in Arvin, California, and in 1975, expanded opera\ntions onto an adjacent .9 acre parcel of land owned jointly\nby the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company,\nand the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (now\nknown respectively as the Burlington Northern and Santa\nFe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Com\npany) (Railroads). Both parcels of the Arvin facility were\ngraded toward a sump and drainage pond located on the\nsoutheast corner of the primary parcel. See Appendix,\ninfra. Neither the sump nor the drainage pond was lined\nuntil 1979, allowing waste water and chemical runoff from\nthe facility to seep into the ground water below.\n   During its years of operation, B&B stored and distrib\nuted various hazardous chemicals on its property. Among\nthese were the herbicide dinoseb, sold by Dow Chemicals,\nand the pesticides D\u2013D and Nemagon, both sold by Shell.\nDinoseb was stored in 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon con\ntainers on a concrete slab outside B&B\u2019s warehouse.\nNemagon was stored in 30-gallon drums and 5-gallon\ncontainers inside the warehouse. Originally, B&B pur\nchased D\u2013D in 55-gallon drums; beginning in the mid\n1960\u2019s, however, Shell began requiring its distributors to\nmaintain bulk storage facilities for D\u2013D. From that time\nonward, B&B purchased D\u2013D in bulk.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Because   D\u2013D is corrosive, bulk storage of the chemical led to nu\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    When B&B purchased D\u2013D, Shell would arrange for\ndelivery by common carrier, f.o.b. destination.2 When the\nproduct arrived, it was transferred from tanker trucks to a\nbulk storage tank located on B&B\u2019s primary parcel. From\nthere, the chemical was transferred to bobtail trucks,\nnurse tanks, and pull rigs. During each of these transfers\nleaks and spills could\u2014and often did\u2014occur. Although\nthe common carrier and B&B used buckets to catch spills\nfrom hoses and gaskets connecting the tanker trucks to its\nbulk storage tank, the buckets sometimes overflowed or\nwere knocked over, causing D\u2013D to spill onto the ground\nduring the transfer process.\n    Aware that spills of D\u2013D were commonplace among its\ndistributors, in the late 1970\u2019s Shell took several steps to\nencourage the safe handling of its products. Shell pro\nvided distributors with detailed safety manuals and insti\ntuted a voluntary discount program for distributors that\nmade improvements in their bulk handling and safety\nfacilities. Later, Shell revised its program to require\ndistributors to obtain an inspection by a qualified engineer\nand provide self-certification of compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations. B&B\u2019s Arvin facility was inspected\ntwice, and in 1981, B&B certified to Shell that it had made\na number of recommended improvements to its facilities.\n    Despite these improvements, B&B remained a\n\u201c \u2018[s]loppy\u2019 [o]perator.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u2013\n1601, p. 130a.

App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u20131601,\np. 124a.\n4       BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntanks and trucks allowed Nemagon, D\u2013D and dinoseb to\nseep into the soil and upper levels of ground water of the\nArvin facility. In 1983, the California Department of Toxic\nSubstances Control (DTSC) began investigating B&B\u2019s\nviolation of hazardous waste laws, and the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) soon followed\nsuit, discovering significant contamination of soil and\nground water. Of particular concern was a plume of con\ntaminated ground water located under the facility that\nthreatened to leach into an adjacent supply of potential\ndrinking water.3\n   Although B&B undertook some efforts at remediation,\nby 1989 it had become insolvent and ceased all operations.\nThat same year, the Arvin facility was added to the Na\ntional Priority List, see 54 Fed. Reg. 41027, and subse\nquently, DTSC and EPA (Governments) exercised their\nauthority under 42 U. S. C. \u00a79604 to undertake cleanup\nefforts at the site. By 1998, the Governments had spent\nmore than $8 million responding to the site contamina\ntion; their costs have continued to accrue.\n   In 1991, EPA issued an administrative order to the\nRailroads directing them, as owners of a portion of the\nproperty on which the Arvin facility was located, to per\nform certain remedial tasks in connection with the site.\nThe Railroads did so, incurring expenses of more than $3\nmillion in the process. Seeking to recover at least a por\ntion of their response costs, in 1992 the Railroads brought\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The ground water at the Arvin site is divided into three zones. The\n\nA-zone is located 60\u201380 feet below the ground. It has been tested and\nfound to have high levels of contamination. The B-zone is located 150\nfeet below ground. Although the B-zone is not currently used as a\nsource of drinking water, it has the potential to serve as such a source.\nNo contamination has yet been found in that zone. The C-zone is an\naquifer located 200 feet below ground. It is the sole current source of\ndrinking water and, thus far, has suffered no contamination from the\nArvin site.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

In 1996, that lawsuit\nwas consolidated with two recovery actions brought by\nDTSC and EPA against Shell and the Railroads.\n  The District Court conducted a 6-week bench trial in\n1999 and four years later entered a judgment in favor of\nthe Governments. In a lengthy order supported by 507\nseparate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court\nheld that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially\nresponsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA\u2014the Railroads\nbecause they were owners of a portion of the facility, see\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a79607(a)(1)\u2013(2), and Shell because it had\n\u201carranged for\u201d the disposal of hazardous substances\nthrough its sale and delivery of D\u2013D, see \u00a79607(a)(3).\n  Although the court found the parties liable, it did not\nimpose joint and several liability on Shell and the Rail\nroads for the entire response cost incurred by the Govern\nments. The court found that the site contamination cre\nated a single harm but concluded that the harm was\ndivisible and therefore capable of apportionment. Based\non three figures\u2014the percentage of the total area of the\nfacility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of\nB&B\u2019s business divided by the term of the Railroads\u2019 lease,\nand the Court\u2019s determination that only two of three\npolluting chemicals spilled on the leased parcel required\nremediation and that those two chemicals were responsi\nble for roughly two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation\u2014the court apportioned the Rail\nroads\u2019 liability as 9% of the Governments\u2019 total response\ncost.4 Based on estimations of chemicals spills of Shell\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Although the Railroads did not produce precise figures regarding\n\nthe exact quantity of chemical spills on each parcel in each year of the\nfacility\u2019s operation, the District Court found it \u201cindisputable that the\noverwhelming majority of hazardous substances were released from the\nB&B parcel.\u201d Id., at 248a. The court explained that \u201cthe predominant\nactivities conducted on the Railroad parcel through the years were\n6       BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nproducts, the court held Shell liable for 6% of the total site\nresponse cost.\n   The Governments appealed the District Court\u2019s appor\ntionment, and Shell cross-appealed the court\u2019s finding of\nliability. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Shell\ndid not qualify as a \u201ctraditional\u201d arranger under\n\u00a79607(a)(3), insofar as it had not contracted with B&B to\ndirectly dispose of a hazardous waste product. 520 F. 3d\n918, 948 (CA9 2008). Nevertheless, the court stated that\nShell could still be held liable under a \u201c \u2018broader\u2019 category\nof arranger liability\u201d if the \u201cdisposal of hazardous wastes\n[wa]s a foreseeable byproduct of, but not the purpose of,\nthe transaction giving rise to\u201d arranger liability. Ibid.\nRelying on CERCLA\u2019s definition of \u201cdisposal,\u201d which cov\ners acts such as \u201cleaking\u201d and \u201cspilling,\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a76903(3), the Ninth Circuit concluded that an entity could\narrange for \u201cdisposal\u201d \u201ceven if it did not intend to dispose\u201d\nof a hazardous substance. 520 F. 3d, at 949.\n   Applying that theory of arranger liability to the District\nCourt\u2019s findings of fact, the Ninth Circuit held that Shell\narranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance\nthrough its sale and delivery of D\u2013D:\n     \u201cShell arranged for delivery of the substances to the\n     site by its subcontractors; was aware of, and to some\n     degree dictated, the transfer arrangements; knew that\n     some leakage was likely in the transfer process; and\n     provided advice and supervision concerning safe\n     transfer and storage. Disposal of a hazardous sub\n     stance was thus a necessary part of the sale and de\n     livery process.\u201d Id., at 950.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstorage and some washing and rinsing of tanks, other receptacles, and\nchemical application vehicles.     Mixing, formulating, loading, and\nunloading of ag-chemical hazardous substances, which contributed\nmost of the liability causing releases, were predominantly carried out\nby B&B on the B&B parcel.\u201d Id., at 247a\u2013248a.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder such circumstances, the court concluded, arranger\nliability was not precluded by the fact that the purpose of\nShell\u2019s action had been to transport a useful and previ\nously unused product to B&B for sale.\n   On the subject of apportionment, the Court of Appeals\nfound \u201cno dispute\u201d on the question whether the harm\ncaused by Shell and the Railroads was capable of appor\ntionment. Id., at 942. The court observed that a portion of\nthe site contamination occurred before the Railroad parcel\nbecame part of the facility, only some of the hazardous\nsubstances were stored on the Railroad parcel, and \u201conly\nsome of the water on the facility washed over the Rail\nroads\u2019 site.\u201d Ibid. With respect to Shell, the court noted\nthat not all of the hazardous substances spilled on the\nfacility had been sold by Shell. Given those facts, the\ncourt readily concluded that \u201cthe contamination traceable\nto the Railroads and Shell, with adequate information,\nwould be allocable, as would be the cost of cleaning up that\ncontamination.\u201d Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals\nheld that the District Court erred in finding that the\nrecord established a reasonable basis for apportionment.\nBecause the burden of proof on the question of apportion\nment rested with Shell and the Railroads, the Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court\u2019s apportionment of\nliability and held Shell and the Railroads jointly and\nseverally liable for the Governments\u2019 cost of responding to\nthe contamination of the Arvin facility.\n   The Railroads and Shell moved for rehearing en banc,\nwhich the Court of Appeals denied over the dissent of\neight judges. See id., at 952 (Bea, J., dissenting).

Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 161\n(2004).6\n   In these cases, it is undisputed that the Railroads qual\nify as PRPs under both \u00a7\u00a79607(a)(1) and 9607(a)(2) be\ncause they owned the land leased by B&B at the time of\nthe contamination and continue to own it now. The more\ndifficult question is whether Shell also qualifies as a PRP\nunder \u00a79607(a)(3) by virtue of the circumstances sur\nrounding its sales to B&B.\n   To determine whether Shell may be held liable as an\narranger, we begin with the language of the statute. As\nrelevant here, \u00a79607(a)(3) applies to an entity that \u201car\nrange[s] for disposal . . . of hazardous substances.\u201d It is\nplain from the language of the statute that CERCLA\nliability would attach under \u00a79607(a)(3) if an entity were\nto enter into a transaction for the sole purpose of discard\ning a used and no longer useful hazardous substance. It is\nsimilarly clear that an entity could not be held liable as an\narranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the\npurchaser of that product later, and unbeknownst to the\nseller, disposed of the product in a way that led to con\ntamination. See Freeman v. Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., 189\nF. 3d 160, 164 (CA2 1999); Florida Power & Light Co. v.\nAllis Chalmers Corp., 893 F. 2d 1313, 1318 (CA11 1990).\nLess clear is the liability attaching to the many permuta\ntions of \u201carrangements\u201d that fall between these two ex\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Under  CERCLA, PRPs are liable for: \u201c(A) all costs of removal or\nremedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State\nor an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan;\n  \u201c(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other per\nson consistent with the national contingency plan;\n  \u201c(C) damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources,\nincluding the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or\nloss resulting from such a release; and\n  \u201c(D) the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried\nout under section 9604(i) of this title.\u201d \u00a79607(a)(4).\n10     BURLINGTON N. & S.

In\nsuch cases, courts have concluded that the determination\nwhether an entity is an arranger requires a fact-intensive\ninquiry that looks beyond the parties\u2019 characterization of\nthe transaction as a \u201cdisposal\u201d or a \u201csale\u201d and seeks to\ndiscern whether the arrangement was one Congress in\ntended to fall within the scope of CERCLA\u2019s strict-liability\nprovisions.

See\nCello-Foil Prods., Inc., 100 F. 3d, at 1231 (\u201c[I]t would be\nerror for us not to recognize the indispensable role that\nstate of mind must play in determining whether a party\nhas \u2018otherwise arranged for disposal . . . of hazardous\nsubstances\u2019 \u201d).\n   The Governments do not deny that the statute requires\nan entity to \u201carrang[e] for\u201d disposal; however, they inter\npret that phrase by reference to the statutory term \u201cdis\nposal,\u201d which the Act broadly defines as \u201cthe discharge,\ndeposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of\nany solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or\nwater.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a76903(3); see also \u00a79601(29) (adopting\nthe definition of \u201cdisposal\u201d contained in the Solid Waste\nDisposal Act).7 The Governments assert that by including\nunintentional acts such as \u201cspilling\u201d and \u201cleaking\u201d in the\ndefinition of disposal, Congress intended to impose liabil\nity on entities not only when they directly dispose of waste\nproducts but also when they engage in legitimate sales of\nhazardous substances8 knowing that some disposal may\noccur as a collateral consequence of the sale itself. Apply\ning that reading of the statute, the Governments contend\nthat Shell arranged for the disposal of D\u2013D within the\nmeaning of \u00a79607(a)(3) by shipping D\u2013D to B&B under\nconditions it knew would result in the spilling of a portion\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 \u201cHazardous waste\u201d is defined as \u201ca solid waste, or combination of\n\nsolid wastes, which . . . may . . . pose a substantial present or potential\nhazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated,\nstored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.\u201d \u00a76903(5)(B);\n\u00a79601(29).\n  8 CERCLA defines \u201chazardous substance\u201d to include a variety of\n\nchemicals and toxins including those designated by EPA as air pollut\nants, water pollutants, and solid wastes. \u00a79601(14).\n12     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the hazardous substance by the purchaser or common\ncarrier. See Brief for United States 24 (\u201cAlthough the\ndelivery of a useful product was the ultimate purpose of\nthe arrangement, Shell\u2019s continued participation in the\ndelivery, with knowledge that spills and leaks would\nresult, was sufficient to establish Shell\u2019s intent to dispose\nof hazardous substances\u201d). Because these spills resulted\nin wasted D\u2013D, a result Shell anticipated, the Govern\nments insist that Shell was properly found to have ar\nranged for the disposal of D\u2013D.\n  While it is true that in some instances an entity\u2019s knowl\nedge that its product will be leaked, spilled, dumped, or\notherwise discarded may provide evidence of the entity\u2019s\nintent to dispose of its hazardous wastes, knowledge alone\nis insufficient to prove that an entity \u201cplanned for\u201d the\ndisposal, particularly when the disposal occurs as a pe\nripheral result of the legitimate sale of an unused, useful\nproduct. In order to qualify as an arranger, Shell must\nhave entered into the sale of D\u2013D with the intention that\nat least a portion of the product be disposed of during the\ntransfer process by one or more of the methods described\nin \u00a76903(3). Here, the facts found by the District Court do\nnot support such a conclusion.\n  Although the evidence adduced at trial showed that\nShell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred\nduring the transfer of D\u2013D from the common carrier to\nB&B\u2019s bulk storage tanks after the product had arrived at\nthe Arvin facility and had come under B&B\u2019s stewardship,\nthe evidence does not support an inference that Shell\nintended such spills to occur. To the contrary, the evi\ndence revealed that Shell took numerous steps to encour\nage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of such spills,\nproviding them with detailed safety manuals, requiring\nthem to maintain adequate storage facilities, and provid\ning discounts for those that took safety precautions. Al\nthough Shell\u2019s efforts were less than wholly successful,\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven these facts, Shell\u2019s mere knowledge that spills and\nleaks continued to occur is insufficient grounds for con\ncluding that Shell \u201carranged for\u201d the disposal of D\u2013D\nwithin the meaning of \u00a79607(a)(3). Accordingly, we con\nclude that Shell was not liable as an arranger for the\ncontamination that occurred at B&B\u2019s Arvin facility.\n                              III\n   Having concluded that Shell is not liable as an arranger,\nwe need not decide whether the Court of Appeals erred in\nreversing the District Court\u2019s apportionment of Shell\u2019s\nliability for the cost of remediation. We must, however,\ndetermine whether the Railroads were properly held\njointly and severally liable for the full cost of the Govern\nments\u2019 response efforts.\n   The seminal opinion on the subject of apportionment in\nCERCLA actions was written in 1983 by Chief Judge Carl\nRubin of the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio. United States v. Chem-Dyne Corp., 572\nF. Supp. 802. After reviewing CERCLA\u2019s history, Chief\nJudge Rubin concluded that although the Act imposed a\n\u201cstrict liability standard,\u201d id., at 805, it did not mandate\n\u201cjoint and several\u201d liability in every case. See id., at 807.\nRather, Congress intended the scope of liability to \u201cbe\ndetermined from traditional and evolving principles of\ncommon law[.]\u201d Id., at 808. The Chem-Dyne approach has\nbeen fully embraced by the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g.,\nIn re Bell Petroleum Services, Inc., 3 F. 3d 889, 901\u2013902\n(CA5 1993); United States v.

Monsanto Co., 858 F. 2d\n160, 171\u2013173 (CA4 1988).\n   Following Chem-Dyne, the courts of appeals have ac\nknowledged that \u201c[t]he universal starting point for divisi\nbility of harm analyses in CERCLA cases\u201d is \u00a7433A of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts.

The question then is whether the record pro\nvided a reasonable basis for the District Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat the Railroads were liable for only 9% of the harm\ncaused by contamination at the Arvin facility.\n    The District Court criticized the Railroads for taking a\n\u201c \u2018scorched earth,\u2019 all-or-nothing approach to liability,\u201d\nfailing to acknowledge any responsibility for the release of\nhazardous substances that occurred on their parcel\nthroughout the 13-year period of B&B\u2019s lease. According\nto the District Court, the Railroads\u2019 position on liability,\ncombined with the Governments\u2019 refusal to acknowledge\nthe potential divisibility of the harm, complicated the\napportioning of liability. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n07\u20131601, at 236a\u2013237a (\u201cAll parties . . . effectively abdi\ncated providing any helpful arguments to the court and\nhave left the court to independently perform the equitable\napportionment analysis demanded by the circumstances of\nthe case\u201d).9 Yet despite the parties\u2019 failure to assist the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 As  the Governments point out, insofar as the District Court made\nreference to equitable considerations favoring apportionment, it erred.\nEquitable considerations play no role in the apportionment analysis;\nrather, apportionment is proper only when the evidence supports the\ndivisibility of the damages jointly caused by the PRPs. See generally\nUnited States v. Hercules, Inc., 247 F. 3d 706, 718\u2013719 (CA8 2001);\nUnited States v. Brighton, 153 F. 3d 307, 318\u2013319 (CA6 1998); Redwing\nCarriers, Inc. v. Saraland Apartments, 94 F. 3d 1489, 1513 (CA11\n1996). As the Court of Appeals explained, \u201c[a]pportionment . . . looks to\nwhether defendants may avoid joint and several liability by establish\ning a fixed amount of damage for which they are liable,\u201d while contribu\ntion actions allow jointly and severally liable PRPs to recover from each\nother on the basis of equitable considerations. 520 F. 3d 918, 939\u2013940\n(CA9 2008); see also 42 U.

The error is of no consequence, however, because despite\nthe District Court\u2019s reference to equity, its actual apportionment\n16      BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt in linking the evidence supporting apportionment to\nthe proper allocation of liability, the District Court ulti\nmately concluded that this was \u201ca classic \u2018divisible in\nterms of degree\u2019 case, both as to the time period in which\ndefendants\u2019 conduct occurred, and ownership existed, and\nas to the estimated maximum contribution of each party\u2019s\nactivities that released hazardous substances that caused\nSite contamination.\u201d Id., at 239a. Consequently, the\nDistrict Court apportioned liability, assigning the Rail\nroads 9% of the total remediation costs.\n   The District Court calculated the Railroads\u2019 liability\nbased on three figures. First, the court noted that the\nRailroad parcel constituted only 19% of the surface area of\nthe Arvin site. Second, the court observed that the Rail\nroads had leased their parcel to B&B for 13 years, which\nwas only 45% of the time B&B operated the Arvin facility.\nFinally, the court found that the volume of hazardous\nsubstance-releasing activities on the B&B property was at\nleast 10 times greater than the releases that occurred on\nthe Railroad parcel, and it concluded that only spills of\ntwo chemicals, Nemagon and dinoseb (not D\u2013D), substan\ntially contributed to the contamination that had originated\non the Railroad parcel and that those two chemicals had\ncontributed to two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation. The court then multiplied .19 by\n.45 by .66 (two-thirds) and rounded up to determine that\nthe Railroads were responsible for approximately 6% of\nthe remediation costs. \u201cAllowing for calculation errors up\nto 50%,\u201d the court concluded that the Railroads could be\nheld responsible for 9% of the total CERCLA response cost\nfor the Arvin site. Id., at 252a.\n   The Court of Appeals criticized the evidence on which\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndecision was properly rooted in evidence that provided a reasonable \n\nbasis for identifying the portion of the harm attributable to the Rail\nroads.\n\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court\u2019s conclusions rested, finding a lack of\nsufficient data to establish the precise proportion of con\ntamination that occurred on the relative portions of the\nArvin facility and the rate of contamination in the years\nprior to B&B\u2019s addition of the Railroad parcel. The court\nnoted that neither the duration of the lease nor the size of\nthe leased area alone was a reliable measure of the harm\ncaused by activities on the property owned by the Rail\nroads, and\u2014as the court\u2019s upward adjustment confirmed\u2014\nthe court had relied on estimates rather than specific and\ndetailed records as a basis for its conclusions.\n   Despite these criticisms, we conclude that the facts\ncontained in the record reasonably supported the appor\ntionment of liability. The District Court\u2019s detailed find\nings make it abundantly clear that the primary pollution\nat the Arvin facility was contained in an unlined sump\nand an unlined pond in the southeastern portion of the\nfacility most distant from the Railroads\u2019 parcel and that\nthe spills of hazardous chemicals that occurred on the\nRailroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the\ntotal site contamination, see id., at 247a\u2013248a, some of\nwhich did not require remediation. With those back\nground facts in mind, we are persuaded that it was rea\nsonable for the court to use the size of the leased parcel\nand the duration of the lease as the starting point for its\nanalysis. Although the Court of Appeals faulted the Dis\ntrict Court for relying on the \u201csimplest of considerations:\npercentages of land area, time of ownership, and types of\nhazardous products,\u201d 520 F. 3d, at 943, these were the\nsame factors the court had earlier acknowledged were\nrelevant to the apportionment analysis. See id., at 936,\nn.18 (\u201cWe of course agree with our sister circuits that, if\nadequate information is available, divisibility may be\nestablished by \u2018volumetric, chronological, or other types of\nevidence,\u2019 including appropriate geographic considera\ntions\u201d (citations omitted)).\n18     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals also criticized the District Court\u2019s\nassumption that spills of Nemagon and dinoseb were\nresponsible for only two-thirds of the chemical spills re\nquiring remediation, observing that each PRP\u2019s share of\nthe total harm was not necessarily equal to the quantity of\npollutants that were deposited on its portion of the total\nfacility. Although the evidence adduced by the parties did\nnot allow the court to calculate precisely the amount of\nhazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to\nthe total site contamination or the exact percentage of\nharm caused by each chemical, the evidence did show that\nfewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that of\nthose spills that occurred, not all were carried across the\nRailroad parcel to the B&B sump and pond from which\nmost of the contamination originated. The fact that no D\u2013\nD spills on the Railroad parcel required remediation lends\nstrength to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Rail\nroad parcel contributed only Nemagon and dinoseb in\nquantities requiring remediation.\n   The District Court\u2019s conclusion that those two chemicals\naccounted for only two-thirds of the contamination requir\ning remediation finds less support in the record; however,\nany miscalculation on that point is harmless in light of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s ultimate allocation of liability, which\nincluded a 50% margin of error equal to the 3% reduction\nin liability the District Court provided based on its as\nsessment of the effect of the Nemagon and dinoseb spills.\nHad the District Court limited its apportionment calcula\ntions to the amount of time the Railroad parcel was in use\nand the percentage of the facility located on that parcel, it\nwould have assigned the Railroads 9% of the response\ncost. By including a two-thirds reduction in liability for\nthe Nemagon and dinoseb with a 50% \u201cmargin of error,\u201d\nthe District Court reached the same result. Because the\nDistrict Court\u2019s ultimate allocation of liability is supported\nby the evidence and comports with the apportionment\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Id., at\n115a. By the mid-1960\u2019s, Shell was delivering its chemical\nto B&B in bulk tank truckloads. Id., at 89a, 115a. As the\nCourt recognizes, \u201cbulk storage of the chemical led to\nnumerous tank failures and spills as the chemical rusted\ntanks and eroded valves.\u201d Ante, at 2\u20133, n. 1.\n  Shell furthermore specified the equipment to be used in\ntransferring the chemicals from the delivery truck to\nB&B\u2019s storage tanks.

Relieving Shell of any obligation to pay for\nthe cleanup undertaken by the United States and Califor\u00ad\nnia is hardly commanded by CERCLA\u2019s text, and is surely\nat odds with CERCLA\u2019s objective\u2014to place the cost of\nremediation on persons whose activities contributed to the\ncontamination rather than on the taxpaying public.\n    As to apportioning costs, the District Court undertook\nan heroic labor. The Railroads and Shell, the court noted,\nhad pursued a \u201c \u2018scorched earth,\u2019 all-or-nothing approach to\nliability. Neither acknowledged an iota of responsibility\n. . . .

Argued February 24, 2009\u2014Decided May 4, 2009*\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Li\n  ability Act (CERCLA) is designed to promote the cleanup of hazard\n  ous waste sites and to ensure that cleanup costs are borne by those\n  responsible for the contamination. In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc.\n  (B&B), an agricultural chemical distributor, began operating on a\n  parcel of land located in Arvin, California. B&B later expanded onto\n  an adjacent parcel owned by petitioners Burlington Northern and\n  Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company\n  (Railroads). As part of its business, B&B purchased and stored vari\n  ous hazardous chemicals, including the pesticide D\u2013D, which it\n  bought from petitioner Shell Oil Company (Shell). Over time, many\n  of these chemicals spilled during transfers and deliveries, and as a\n  result of equipment failures.\n     Investigations of B&B by the California Department of Toxic Sub\n  stances Control and the federal Environmental Protection Agency\n  (Governments) revealed significant soil and ground water contamina\n  tion and in 1989, the Governments exercised their CERCLA author\n  ity to clean up the Arvin site, spending over $8 million by 1998.\n  Seeking to recover their costs, the Governments initiated legal action\n  against Shell and the Railroads. The District Court ruled in favor of\n  the Governments, finding that both the Railroads and Shell were po\n  tentially responsible parties under CERCLA\u2014the Railroads because\n  they owned part of the facility and Shell because it had \u201carranged for\n  disposal . . . of hazardous substances,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a79607(a)(3),\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 07\u20131607, Shell Oil Co. v. United States et al., also\non certiorari to the same court.\n2         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    through D\u2013D\u2019s sale and delivery. The District Court apportioned li\n    ability, holding the Railroads liable for 9% of the Governments\u2019 total\n    response costs, and Shell liable for 6%. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\n    agreed that Shell could be held liable as an arranger under\n    \u00a79607(a)(3) and affirmed the District Court\u2019s decision in that respect.\n    Although the Court of Appeals agreed that the harm in this case was\n    theoretically capable of apportionment, it found the facts present in\n    the record insufficient to support apportionment, and therefore held\n    Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Govern\n    ments\u2019 response costs.\nHeld:\n    1. Shell is not liable as an arranger for the contamination at the\n Arvin facility. Section \u00a79607(a)(3) liability may not extend beyond\n the limits of the statute itself. Because CERCLA does not specifically\n define what it means to \u201carrang[e] for\u201d disposal of a hazardous sub\n stance, the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. In common\n parlance, \u201carrange\u201d implies action directed to a specific purpose.\n Thus, under \u00a79607(a)(3)\u2019s plain language, an entity may qualify as an\n arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous\n substance. To qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into\n D\u2013D sales with the intent that at least a portion of the product be\n disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of \u00a76903(3)\u2019s\n methods. The facts found by the District Court do not support such a\n conclusion. The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, ac\n cidental spills occurred during D\u2013D\u2019s transfer from the common car\n rier to B&B\u2019s storage tanks after the product had come under B&B\u2019s\n stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps\n to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of spills. Thus,\n Shell\u2019s mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient\n grounds for concluding that it \u201carranged for\u201d D\u2013D\u2019s disposal. Pp. 8\u2013\n 13.\n    2. The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads\u2019 share\n of the site remediation costs at 9%. Calculating liability based on\n three figures\u2014the percentage of the total area of the facility that was\n owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&B\u2019s business divided by\n the term of the Railroads\u2019 lease, and the court\u2019s determination that\n only two polluting chemicals (not D\u2013D) spilled on the leased parcel\n required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for\n roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contamination\u2014the District\n Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for\n 9% of the remediation costs. The District Court\u2019s detailed findings\n show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the fa\n cility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous\n chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the par\n  ties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount\n  of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total\n  site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each\n  chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Rail\n  road parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&B site, where\n  most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion\n  that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring\n  remediation.

(B&B), began operating\nan agricultural chemical distribution business, purchasing\npesticides and other chemical products from suppliers\nsuch as Shell Oil Company (Shell). Using its own equip\nment, B&B applied its products to customers\u2019 farms. B&B\nopened its business on a 3.8 acre parcel of former farm\nland in Arvin, California, and in 1975, expanded opera\ntions onto an adjacent .9 acre parcel of land owned jointly\nby the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company,\nand the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (now\nknown respectively as the Burlington Northern and Santa\nFe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Com\npany) (Railroads). Both parcels of the Arvin facility were\ngraded toward a sump and drainage pond located on the\nsoutheast corner of the primary parcel. See Appendix,\ninfra. Neither the sump nor the drainage pond was lined\nuntil 1979, allowing waste water and chemical runoff from\nthe facility to seep into the ground water below.\n   During its years of operation, B&B stored and distrib\nuted various hazardous chemicals on its property. Among\nthese were the herbicide dinoseb, sold by Dow Chemicals,\nand the pesticides D\u2013D and Nemagon, both sold by Shell.\nDinoseb was stored in 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon con\ntainers on a concrete slab outside B&B\u2019s warehouse.\nNemagon was stored in 30-gallon drums and 5-gallon\ncontainers inside the warehouse.

S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    When B&B purchased D\u2013D, Shell would arrange for\ndelivery by common carrier, f.o.b. destination.2 When the\nproduct arrived, it was transferred from tanker trucks to a\nbulk storage tank located on B&B\u2019s primary parcel. From\nthere, the chemical was transferred to bobtail trucks,\nnurse tanks, and pull rigs. During each of these transfers\nleaks and spills could\u2014and often did\u2014occur. Although\nthe common carrier and B&B used buckets to catch spills\nfrom hoses and gaskets connecting the tanker trucks to its\nbulk storage tank, the buckets sometimes overflowed or\nwere knocked over, causing D\u2013D to spill onto the ground\nduring the transfer process.\n    Aware that spills of D\u2013D were commonplace among its\ndistributors, in the late 1970\u2019s Shell took several steps to\nencourage the safe handling of its products. Shell pro\nvided distributors with detailed safety manuals and insti\ntuted a voluntary discount program for distributors that\nmade improvements in their bulk handling and safety\nfacilities. Later, Shell revised its program to require\ndistributors to obtain an inspection by a qualified engineer\nand provide self-certification of compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations. B&B\u2019s Arvin facility was inspected\ntwice, and in 1981, B&B certified to Shell that it had made\na number of recommended improvements to its facilities.\n    Despite these improvements, B&B remained a\n\u201c \u2018[s]loppy\u2019 [o]perator.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07\u2013\n1601, p. 130a.

In 1983, the California Department of Toxic\nSubstances Control (DTSC) began investigating B&B\u2019s\nviolation of hazardous waste laws, and the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) soon followed\nsuit, discovering significant contamination of soil and\nground water. Of particular concern was a plume of con\ntaminated ground water located under the facility that\nthreatened to leach into an adjacent supply of potential\ndrinking water.3\n   Although B&B undertook some efforts at remediation,\nby 1989 it had become insolvent and ceased all operations.\nThat same year, the Arvin facility was added to the Na\ntional Priority List, see 54 Fed. Reg. 41027, and subse\nquently, DTSC and EPA (Governments) exercised their\nauthority under 42 U. S. C. \u00a79604 to undertake cleanup\nefforts at the site. By 1998, the Governments had spent\nmore than $8 million responding to the site contamina\ntion; their costs have continued to accrue.\n   In 1991, EPA issued an administrative order to the\nRailroads directing them, as owners of a portion of the\nproperty on which the Arvin facility was located, to per\nform certain remedial tasks in connection with the site.\nThe Railroads did so, incurring expenses of more than $3\nmillion in the process. Seeking to recover at least a por\ntion of their response costs, in 1992 the Railroads brought\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The ground water at the Arvin site is divided into three zones.

Although the B-zone is not currently used as a\nsource of drinking water, it has the potential to serve as such a source.\nNo contamination has yet been found in that zone. The C-zone is an\naquifer located 200 feet below ground. It is the sole current source of\ndrinking water and, thus far, has suffered no contamination from the\nArvin site.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

In 1996, that lawsuit\nwas consolidated with two recovery actions brought by\nDTSC and EPA against Shell and the Railroads.\n  The District Court conducted a 6-week bench trial in\n1999 and four years later entered a judgment in favor of\nthe Governments. In a lengthy order supported by 507\nseparate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court\nheld that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially\nresponsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA\u2014the Railroads\nbecause they were owners of a portion of the facility, see\n42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a79607(a)(1)\u2013(2), and Shell because it had\n\u201carranged for\u201d the disposal of hazardous substances\nthrough its sale and delivery of D\u2013D, see \u00a79607(a)(3).\n  Although the court found the parties liable, it did not\nimpose joint and several liability on Shell and the Rail\nroads for the entire response cost incurred by the Govern\nments. The court found that the site contamination cre\nated a single harm but concluded that the harm was\ndivisible and therefore capable of apportionment. Based\non three figures\u2014the percentage of the total area of the\nfacility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of\nB&B\u2019s business divided by the term of the Railroads\u2019 lease,\nand the Court\u2019s determination that only two of three\npolluting chemicals spilled on the leased parcel required\nremediation and that those two chemicals were responsi\nble for roughly two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation\u2014the court apportioned the Rail\nroads\u2019 liability as 9% of the Governments\u2019 total response\ncost.4 Based on estimations of chemicals spills of Shell\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Although the Railroads did not produce precise figures regarding\n\nthe exact quantity of chemical spills on each parcel in each year of the\nfacility\u2019s operation, the District Court found it \u201cindisputable that the\noverwhelming majority of hazardous substances were released from the\nB&B parcel.\u201d Id., at 248a. The court explained that \u201cthe predominant\nactivities conducted on the Railroad parcel through the years were\n6       BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nproducts, the court held Shell liable for 6% of the total site\nresponse cost.\n   The Governments appealed the District Court\u2019s appor\ntionment, and Shell cross-appealed the court\u2019s finding of\nliability. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Shell\ndid not qualify as a \u201ctraditional\u201d arranger under\n\u00a79607(a)(3), insofar as it had not contracted with B&B to\ndirectly dispose of a hazardous waste product. 520 F. 3d\n918, 948 (CA9 2008). Nevertheless, the court stated that\nShell could still be held liable under a \u201c \u2018broader\u2019 category\nof arranger liability\u201d if the \u201cdisposal of hazardous wastes\n[wa]s a foreseeable byproduct of, but not the purpose of,\nthe transaction giving rise to\u201d arranger liability. Ibid.\nRelying on CERCLA\u2019s definition of \u201cdisposal,\u201d which cov\ners acts such as \u201cleaking\u201d and \u201cspilling,\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a76903(3), the Ninth Circuit concluded that an entity could\narrange for \u201cdisposal\u201d \u201ceven if it did not intend to dispose\u201d\nof a hazardous substance. 520 F. 3d, at 949.\n   Applying that theory of arranger liability to the District\nCourt\u2019s findings of fact, the Ninth Circuit held that Shell\narranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance\nthrough its sale and delivery of D\u2013D:\n     \u201cShell arranged for delivery of the substances to the\n     site by its subcontractors; was aware of, and to some\n     degree dictated, the transfer arrangements; knew that\n     some leakage was likely in the transfer process; and\n     provided advice and supervision concerning safe\n     transfer and storage. Disposal of a hazardous sub\n     stance was thus a necessary part of the sale and de\n     livery process.\u201d Id., at 950.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstorage and some washing and rinsing of tanks, other receptacles, and\nchemical application vehicles.

S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder such circumstances, the court concluded, arranger\nliability was not precluded by the fact that the purpose of\nShell\u2019s action had been to transport a useful and previ\nously unused product to B&B for sale.\n   On the subject of apportionment, the Court of Appeals\nfound \u201cno dispute\u201d on the question whether the harm\ncaused by Shell and the Railroads was capable of appor\ntionment. Id., at 942. The court observed that a portion of\nthe site contamination occurred before the Railroad parcel\nbecame part of the facility, only some of the hazardous\nsubstances were stored on the Railroad parcel, and \u201conly\nsome of the water on the facility washed over the Rail\nroads\u2019 site.\u201d Ibid. With respect to Shell, the court noted\nthat not all of the hazardous substances spilled on the\nfacility had been sold by Shell. Given those facts, the\ncourt readily concluded that \u201cthe contamination traceable\nto the Railroads and Shell, with adequate information,\nwould be allocable, as would be the cost of cleaning up that\ncontamination.\u201d Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals\nheld that the District Court erred in finding that the\nrecord established a reasonable basis for apportionment.\nBecause the burden of proof on the question of apportion\nment rested with Shell and the Railroads, the Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court\u2019s apportionment of\nliability and held Shell and the Railroads jointly and\nseverally liable for the Governments\u2019 cost of responding to\nthe contamination of the Arvin facility.\n   The Railroads and Shell moved for rehearing en banc,\nwhich the Court of Appeals denied over the dissent of\neight judges. See id., at 952 (Bea, J., dissenting). We\ngranted certiorari to determine whether Shell was prop\nerly held liable as an entity that had \u201carranged for dis\nposal\u201d of hazardous substances within the meaning of\n\u00a79607(a)(3), and whether Shell and the Railroads were\nproperly held liable for all response costs incurred by EPA\nand the State of California.

The more\ndifficult question is whether Shell also qualifies as a PRP\nunder \u00a79607(a)(3) by virtue of the circumstances sur\nrounding its sales to B&B.\n   To determine whether Shell may be held liable as an\narranger, we begin with the language of the statute. As\nrelevant here, \u00a79607(a)(3) applies to an entity that \u201car\nrange[s] for disposal . . . of hazardous substances.\u201d It is\nplain from the language of the statute that CERCLA\nliability would attach under \u00a79607(a)(3) if an entity were\nto enter into a transaction for the sole purpose of discard\ning a used and no longer useful hazardous substance. It is\nsimilarly clear that an entity could not be held liable as an\narranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the\npurchaser of that product later, and unbeknownst to the\nseller, disposed of the product in a way that led to con\ntamination.

Apply\ning that reading of the statute, the Governments contend\nthat Shell arranged for the disposal of D\u2013D within the\nmeaning of \u00a79607(a)(3) by shipping D\u2013D to B&B under\nconditions it knew would result in the spilling of a portion\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 \u201cHazardous waste\u201d is defined as \u201ca solid waste, or combination of\n\nsolid wastes, which . . . may . . . pose a substantial present or potential\nhazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated,\nstored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.\u201d \u00a76903(5)(B);\n\u00a79601(29).\n  8 CERCLA defines \u201chazardous substance\u201d to include a variety of\n\nchemicals and toxins including those designated by EPA as air pollut\nants, water pollutants, and solid wastes. \u00a79601(14).\n12     BURLINGTON N. & S.

See Brief for United States 24 (\u201cAlthough the\ndelivery of a useful product was the ultimate purpose of\nthe arrangement, Shell\u2019s continued participation in the\ndelivery, with knowledge that spills and leaks would\nresult, was sufficient to establish Shell\u2019s intent to dispose\nof hazardous substances\u201d). Because these spills resulted\nin wasted D\u2013D, a result Shell anticipated, the Govern\nments insist that Shell was properly found to have ar\nranged for the disposal of D\u2013D.\n  While it is true that in some instances an entity\u2019s knowl\nedge that its product will be leaked, spilled, dumped, or\notherwise discarded may provide evidence of the entity\u2019s\nintent to dispose of its hazardous wastes, knowledge alone\nis insufficient to prove that an entity \u201cplanned for\u201d the\ndisposal, particularly when the disposal occurs as a pe\nripheral result of the legitimate sale of an unused, useful\nproduct. In order to qualify as an arranger, Shell must\nhave entered into the sale of D\u2013D with the intention that\nat least a portion of the product be disposed of during the\ntransfer process by one or more of the methods described\nin \u00a76903(3). Here, the facts found by the District Court do\nnot support such a conclusion.\n  Although the evidence adduced at trial showed that\nShell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred\nduring the transfer of D\u2013D from the common carrier to\nB&B\u2019s bulk storage tanks after the product had arrived at\nthe Arvin facility and had come under B&B\u2019s stewardship,\nthe evidence does not support an inference that Shell\nintended such spills to occur. To the contrary, the evi\ndence revealed that Shell took numerous steps to encour\nage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of such spills,\nproviding them with detailed safety manuals, requiring\nthem to maintain adequate storage facilities, and provid\ning discounts for those that took safety precautions.

Accordingly, we con\nclude that Shell was not liable as an arranger for the\ncontamination that occurred at B&B\u2019s Arvin facility.\n                              III\n   Having concluded that Shell is not liable as an arranger,\nwe need not decide whether the Court of Appeals erred in\nreversing the District Court\u2019s apportionment of Shell\u2019s\nliability for the cost of remediation. We must, however,\ndetermine whether the Railroads were properly held\njointly and severally liable for the full cost of the Govern\nments\u2019 response efforts.\n   The seminal opinion on the subject of apportionment in\nCERCLA actions was written in 1983 by Chief Judge Carl\nRubin of the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio. United States v. Chem-Dyne Corp., 572\nF. Supp. 802. After reviewing CERCLA\u2019s history, Chief\nJudge Rubin concluded that although the Act imposed a\n\u201cstrict liability standard,\u201d id., at 805, it did not mandate\n\u201cjoint and several\u201d liability in every case. See id., at 807.\nRather, Congress intended the scope of liability to \u201cbe\ndetermined from traditional and evolving principles of\ncommon law[.]\u201d Id., at 808. The Chem-Dyne approach has\nbeen fully embraced by the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g.,\nIn re Bell Petroleum Services, Inc., 3 F. 3d 889, 901\u2013902\n(CA5 1993); United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., 964\nF. 2d 252, 268 (CA3 1992); O\u2019Neil v. Picillo, 883 F. 2d 176,\n178 (CA1 1989); United States v. Monsanto Co., 858 F. 2d\n160, 171\u2013173 (CA4 1988).\n   Following Chem-Dyne, the courts of appeals have ac\nknowledged that \u201c[t]he universal starting point for divisi\nbility of harm analyses in CERCLA cases\u201d is \u00a7433A of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts. United States v. Hercules,\n14      BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nInc., 247 F. 3d 706, 717 (CA8 2001); Chem-Nuclear Sys\ntems, Inc. v.

Under the Restatement,\n     \u201cwhen two or more persons acting independently\n     caus[e] a distinct or single harm for which there is a\n     reasonable basis for division according to the contri\n     bution of each, each is subject to liability only for the\n     portion of the total harm that he has himself caused.\n     Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7433A, 881 (1976);\n     Prosser, Law of Torts, pp. 313\u2013314 (4th ed. 1971) . . . .\n     But where two or more persons cause a single and in\n     divisible harm, each is subject to liability for the en\n     tire harm.

See Chem-Dyne Corp., 572\nF. Supp., at 810 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7433B (1976)) (placing burden of proof on party seeking\napportionment).

The question then is whether the record pro\nvided a reasonable basis for the District Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat the Railroads were liable for only 9% of the harm\ncaused by contamination at the Arvin facility.\n    The District Court criticized the Railroads for taking a\n\u201c \u2018scorched earth,\u2019 all-or-nothing approach to liability,\u201d\nfailing to acknowledge any responsibility for the release of\nhazardous substances that occurred on their parcel\nthroughout the 13-year period of B&B\u2019s lease. According\nto the District Court, the Railroads\u2019 position on liability,\ncombined with the Governments\u2019 refusal to acknowledge\nthe potential divisibility of the harm, complicated the\napportioning of liability. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n07\u20131601, at 236a\u2013237a (\u201cAll parties . . . effectively abdi\ncated providing any helpful arguments to the court and\nhave left the court to independently perform the equitable\napportionment analysis demanded by the circumstances of\nthe case\u201d).9 Yet despite the parties\u2019 failure to assist the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 As  the Governments point out, insofar as the District Court made\nreference to equitable considerations favoring apportionment, it erred.\nEquitable considerations play no role in the apportionment analysis;\nrather, apportionment is proper only when the evidence supports the\ndivisibility of the damages jointly caused by the PRPs. See generally\nUnited States v. Hercules, Inc., 247 F. 3d 706, 718\u2013719 (CA8 2001);\nUnited States v. Brighton, 153 F. 3d 307, 318\u2013319 (CA6 1998); Redwing\nCarriers, Inc. v. Saraland Apartments, 94 F. 3d 1489, 1513 (CA11\n1996). As the Court of Appeals explained, \u201c[a]pportionment . . . looks to\nwhether defendants may avoid joint and several liability by establish\ning a fixed amount of damage for which they are liable,\u201d while contribu\ntion actions allow jointly and severally liable PRPs to recover from each\nother on the basis of equitable considerations. 520 F. 3d 918, 939\u2013940\n(CA9 2008); see also 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(f)(1) (providing that, \u201c[i]n resolv\ning contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among\nliable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are\nappropriate\u201d). The error is of no consequence, however, because despite\nthe District Court\u2019s reference to equity, its actual apportionment\n16      BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt in linking the evidence supporting apportionment to\nthe proper allocation of liability, the District Court ulti\nmately concluded that this was \u201ca classic \u2018divisible in\nterms of degree\u2019 case, both as to the time period in which\ndefendants\u2019 conduct occurred, and ownership existed, and\nas to the estimated maximum contribution of each party\u2019s\nactivities that released hazardous substances that caused\nSite contamination.\u201d Id., at 239a. Consequently, the\nDistrict Court apportioned liability, assigning the Rail\nroads 9% of the total remediation costs.\n   The District Court calculated the Railroads\u2019 liability\nbased on three figures. First, the court noted that the\nRailroad parcel constituted only 19% of the surface area of\nthe Arvin site. Second, the court observed that the Rail\nroads had leased their parcel to B&B for 13 years, which\nwas only 45% of the time B&B operated the Arvin facility.\nFinally, the court found that the volume of hazardous\nsubstance-releasing activities on the B&B property was at\nleast 10 times greater than the releases that occurred on\nthe Railroad parcel, and it concluded that only spills of\ntwo chemicals, Nemagon and dinoseb (not D\u2013D), substan\ntially contributed to the contamination that had originated\non the Railroad parcel and that those two chemicals had\ncontributed to two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation. The court then multiplied .19 by\n.45 by .66 (two-thirds) and rounded up to determine that\nthe Railroads were responsible for approximately 6% of\nthe remediation costs. \u201cAllowing for calculation errors up\nto 50%,\u201d the court concluded that the Railroads could be\nheld responsible for 9% of the total CERCLA response cost\nfor the Arvin site. Id., at 252a.\n   The Court of Appeals criticized the evidence on which\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndecision was properly rooted in evidence that provided a reasonable \n\nbasis for identifying the portion of the harm attributable to the Rail\nroads.\n\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court\u2019s conclusions rested, finding a lack of\nsufficient data to establish the precise proportion of con\ntamination that occurred on the relative portions of the\nArvin facility and the rate of contamination in the years\nprior to B&B\u2019s addition of the Railroad parcel. The court\nnoted that neither the duration of the lease nor the size of\nthe leased area alone was a reliable measure of the harm\ncaused by activities on the property owned by the Rail\nroads, and\u2014as the court\u2019s upward adjustment confirmed\u2014\nthe court had relied on estimates rather than specific and\ndetailed records as a basis for its conclusions.\n   Despite these criticisms, we conclude that the facts\ncontained in the record reasonably supported the appor\ntionment of liability. The District Court\u2019s detailed find\nings make it abundantly clear that the primary pollution\nat the Arvin facility was contained in an unlined sump\nand an unlined pond in the southeastern portion of the\nfacility most distant from the Railroads\u2019 parcel and that\nthe spills of hazardous chemicals that occurred on the\nRailroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the\ntotal site contamination, see id., at 247a\u2013248a, some of\nwhich did not require remediation. With those back\nground facts in mind, we are persuaded that it was rea\nsonable for the court to use the size of the leased parcel\nand the duration of the lease as the starting point for its\nanalysis. Although the Court of Appeals faulted the Dis\ntrict Court for relying on the \u201csimplest of considerations:\npercentages of land area, time of ownership, and types of\nhazardous products,\u201d 520 F. 3d, at 943, these were the\nsame factors the court had earlier acknowledged were\nrelevant to the apportionment analysis. See id., at 936,\nn.18 (\u201cWe of course agree with our sister circuits that, if\nadequate information is available, divisibility may be\nestablished by \u2018volumetric, chronological, or other types of\nevidence,\u2019 including appropriate geographic considera\ntions\u201d (citations omitted)).\n18     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals also criticized the District Court\u2019s\nassumption that spills of Nemagon and dinoseb were\nresponsible for only two-thirds of the chemical spills re\nquiring remediation, observing that each PRP\u2019s share of\nthe total harm was not necessarily equal to the quantity of\npollutants that were deposited on its portion of the total\nfacility. Although the evidence adduced by the parties did\nnot allow the court to calculate precisely the amount of\nhazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to\nthe total site contamination or the exact percentage of\nharm caused by each chemical, the evidence did show that\nfewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that of\nthose spills that occurred, not all were carried across the\nRailroad parcel to the B&B sump and pond from which\nmost of the contamination originated. The fact that no D\u2013\nD spills on the Railroad parcel required remediation lends\nstrength to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Rail\nroad parcel contributed only Nemagon and dinoseb in\nquantities requiring remediation.\n   The District Court\u2019s conclusion that those two chemicals\naccounted for only two-thirds of the contamination requir\ning remediation finds less support in the record; however,\nany miscalculation on that point is harmless in light of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s ultimate allocation of liability, which\nincluded a 50% margin of error equal to the 3% reduction\nin liability the District Court provided based on its as\nsessment of the effect of the Nemagon and dinoseb spills.\nHad the District Court limited its apportionment calcula\ntions to the amount of time the Railroad parcel was in use\nand the percentage of the facility located on that parcel, it\nwould have assigned the Railroads 9% of the response\ncost. By including a two-thirds reduction in liability for\nthe Nemagon and dinoseb with a 50% \u201cmargin of error,\u201d\nthe District Court reached the same result. Because the\nDistrict Court\u2019s ultimate allocation of liability is supported\nby the evidence and comports with the apportionment\n                 Cite as: 556 U.
