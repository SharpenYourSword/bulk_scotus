Argued February 24, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009*\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Li\n  ability Act (CERCLA) is designed to promote the cleanup of hazard\n  ous waste sites and to ensure that cleanup costs are borne by those\n  responsible for the contamination. In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc.\n  (B&B), an agricultural chemical distributor, began operating on a\n  parcel of land located in Arvin, California. B&B later expanded onto\n  an adjacent parcel owned by petitioners Burlington Northern and\n  Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company\n  (Railroads). As part of its business, B&B purchased and stored vari\n  ous hazardous chemicals, including the pesticide D–D, which it\n  bought from petitioner Shell Oil Company (Shell). Over time, many\n  of these chemicals spilled during transfers and deliveries, and as a\n  result of equipment failures.\n     Investigations of B&B by the California Department of Toxic Sub\n  stances Control and the federal Environmental Protection Agency\n  (Governments) revealed significant soil and ground water contamina\n  tion and in 1989, the Governments exercised their CERCLA author\n  ity to clean up the Arvin site, spending over $8 million by 1998.\n  Seeking to recover their costs, the Governments initiated legal action\n  against Shell and the Railroads. The District Court ruled in favor of\n  the Governments, finding that both the Railroads and Shell were po\n  tentially responsible parties under CERCLA—the Railroads because\n  they owned part of the facility and Shell because it had “arranged for\n  disposal . . . of hazardous substances,” 42 U. S. C. §9607(a)(3),\n——————\n  * Together with No. 07–1607, Shell Oil Co. v. United States et al., also\non certiorari to the same court.\n2         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    through D–D’s sale and delivery. The District Court apportioned li\n    ability, holding the Railroads liable for 9% of the Governments’ total\n    response costs, and Shell liable for 6%. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\n    agreed that Shell could be held liable as an arranger under\n    §9607(a)(3) and affirmed the District Court’s decision in that respect.\n    Although the Court of Appeals agreed that the harm in this case was\n    theoretically capable of apportionment, it found the facts present in\n    the record insufficient to support apportionment, and therefore held\n    Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Govern\n    ments’ response costs.\nHeld:\n    1. Shell is not liable as an arranger for the contamination at the\n Arvin facility. Section §9607(a)(3) liability may not extend beyond\n the limits of the statute itself. Because CERCLA does not specifically\n define what it means to “arrang[e] for” disposal of a hazardous sub\n stance, the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. In common\n parlance, “arrange” implies action directed to a specific purpose.\n Thus, under §9607(a)(3)’s plain language, an entity may qualify as an\n arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous\n substance. To qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into\n D–D sales with the intent that at least a portion of the product be\n disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of §6903(3)’s\n methods. The facts found by the District Court do not support such a\n conclusion. The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, ac\n cidental spills occurred during D–D’s transfer from the common car\n rier to B&B’s storage tanks after the product had come under B&B’s\n stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps\n to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of spills. Thus,\n Shell’s mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient\n grounds for concluding that it “arranged for” D–D’s disposal. Pp. 8–\n 13.\n    2. The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads’ share\n of the site remediation costs at 9%. Calculating liability based on\n three figures—the percentage of the total area of the facility that was\n owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&B’s business divided by\n the term of the Railroads’ lease, and the court’s determination that\n only two polluting chemicals (not D–D) spilled on the leased parcel\n required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for\n roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contamination—the District\n Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for\n 9% of the remediation costs. The District Court’s detailed findings\n show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the fa\n cility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous\n chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the par\n  ties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount\n  of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total\n  site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each\n  chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Rail\n  road parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&B site, where\n  most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion\n  that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring\n  remediation.

S. C.\n§§9601–9675, in response to the serious environmental\nand health risks posed by industrial pollution. See United\nStates v. Bestfoods, 524 U. S. 51, 55 (1998). The Act was\ndesigned to promote the “ ‘timely cleanup of hazardous\nwaste sites’ ” and to ensure that the costs of such cleanup\nefforts were borne by those responsible for the contamina\ntion.

(B&B), began operating\nan agricultural chemical distribution business, purchasing\npesticides and other chemical products from suppliers\nsuch as Shell Oil Company (Shell). Using its own equip\nment, B&B applied its products to customers’ farms. B&B\nopened its business on a 3.8 acre parcel of former farm\nland in Arvin, California, and in 1975, expanded opera\ntions onto an adjacent .9 acre parcel of land owned jointly\nby the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company,\nand the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (now\nknown respectively as the Burlington Northern and Santa\nFe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Com\npany) (Railroads). Both parcels of the Arvin facility were\ngraded toward a sump and drainage pond located on the\nsoutheast corner of the primary parcel. See Appendix,\ninfra. Neither the sump nor the drainage pond was lined\nuntil 1979, allowing waste water and chemical runoff from\nthe facility to seep into the ground water below.\n   During its years of operation, B&B stored and distrib\nuted various hazardous chemicals on its property. Among\nthese were the herbicide dinoseb, sold by Dow Chemicals,\nand the pesticides D–D and Nemagon, both sold by Shell.\nDinoseb was stored in 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon con\ntainers on a concrete slab outside B&B’s warehouse.\nNemagon was stored in 30-gallon drums and 5-gallon\ncontainers inside the warehouse. Originally, B&B pur\nchased D–D in 55-gallon drums; beginning in the mid\n1960’s, however, Shell began requiring its distributors to\nmaintain bulk storage facilities for D–D. From that time\nonward, B&B purchased D–D in bulk.1\n——————\n    1 Because   D–D is corrosive, bulk storage of the chemical led to nu\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    When B&B purchased D–D, Shell would arrange for\ndelivery by common carrier, f.o.b. destination.2 When the\nproduct arrived, it was transferred from tanker trucks to a\nbulk storage tank located on B&B’s primary parcel. From\nthere, the chemical was transferred to bobtail trucks,\nnurse tanks, and pull rigs. During each of these transfers\nleaks and spills could—and often did—occur. Although\nthe common carrier and B&B used buckets to catch spills\nfrom hoses and gaskets connecting the tanker trucks to its\nbulk storage tank, the buckets sometimes overflowed or\nwere knocked over, causing D–D to spill onto the ground\nduring the transfer process.\n    Aware that spills of D–D were commonplace among its\ndistributors, in the late 1970’s Shell took several steps to\nencourage the safe handling of its products. Shell pro\nvided distributors with detailed safety manuals and insti\ntuted a voluntary discount program for distributors that\nmade improvements in their bulk handling and safety\nfacilities. Later, Shell revised its program to require\ndistributors to obtain an inspection by a qualified engineer\nand provide self-certification of compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations. B&B’s Arvin facility was inspected\ntwice, and in 1981, B&B certified to Shell that it had made\na number of recommended improvements to its facilities.\n    Despite these improvements, B&B remained a\n“ ‘[s]loppy’ [o]perator.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–\n1601, p. 130a.

C. C. §2–319(1)(b) (2001). The District Court found\nthat B&B assumed “stewardship” over the D–D as soon as the common\ncarrier entered the Arvin facility.

In 1983, the California Department of Toxic\nSubstances Control (DTSC) began investigating B&B’s\nviolation of hazardous waste laws, and the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) soon followed\nsuit, discovering significant contamination of soil and\nground water. Of particular concern was a plume of con\ntaminated ground water located under the facility that\nthreatened to leach into an adjacent supply of potential\ndrinking water.3\n   Although B&B undertook some efforts at remediation,\nby 1989 it had become insolvent and ceased all operations.\nThat same year, the Arvin facility was added to the Na\ntional Priority List, see 54 Fed. Reg. 41027, and subse\nquently, DTSC and EPA (Governments) exercised their\nauthority under 42 U. S. C. §9604 to undertake cleanup\nefforts at the site. By 1998, the Governments had spent\nmore than $8 million responding to the site contamina\ntion; their costs have continued to accrue.\n   In 1991, EPA issued an administrative order to the\nRailroads directing them, as owners of a portion of the\nproperty on which the Arvin facility was located, to per\nform certain remedial tasks in connection with the site.\nThe Railroads did so, incurring expenses of more than $3\nmillion in the process. Seeking to recover at least a por\ntion of their response costs, in 1992 the Railroads brought\n\n——————\n  3 The ground water at the Arvin site is divided into three zones. The\n\nA-zone is located 60–80 feet below the ground. It has been tested and\nfound to have high levels of contamination. The B-zone is located 150\nfeet below ground. Although the B-zone is not currently used as a\nsource of drinking water, it has the potential to serve as such a source.\nNo contamination has yet been found in that zone. The C-zone is an\naquifer located 200 feet below ground. It is the sole current source of\ndrinking water and, thus far, has suffered no contamination from the\nArvin site.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

In 1996, that lawsuit\nwas consolidated with two recovery actions brought by\nDTSC and EPA against Shell and the Railroads.\n  The District Court conducted a 6-week bench trial in\n1999 and four years later entered a judgment in favor of\nthe Governments. In a lengthy order supported by 507\nseparate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court\nheld that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially\nresponsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA—the Railroads\nbecause they were owners of a portion of the facility, see\n42 U. S. C. §§9607(a)(1)–(2), and Shell because it had\n“arranged for” the disposal of hazardous substances\nthrough its sale and delivery of D–D, see §9607(a)(3).\n  Although the court found the parties liable, it did not\nimpose joint and several liability on Shell and the Rail\nroads for the entire response cost incurred by the Govern\nments. The court found that the site contamination cre\nated a single harm but concluded that the harm was\ndivisible and therefore capable of apportionment. Based\non three figures—the percentage of the total area of the\nfacility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of\nB&B’s business divided by the term of the Railroads’ lease,\nand the Court’s determination that only two of three\npolluting chemicals spilled on the leased parcel required\nremediation and that those two chemicals were responsi\nble for roughly two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation—the court apportioned the Rail\nroads’ liability as 9% of the Governments’ total response\ncost.4 Based on estimations of chemicals spills of Shell\n——————\n  4 Although the Railroads did not produce precise figures regarding\n\nthe exact quantity of chemical spills on each parcel in each year of the\nfacility’s operation, the District Court found it “indisputable that the\noverwhelming majority of hazardous substances were released from the\nB&B parcel.” Id., at 248a. The court explained that “the predominant\nactivities conducted on the Railroad parcel through the years were\n6       BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nproducts, the court held Shell liable for 6% of the total site\nresponse cost.\n   The Governments appealed the District Court’s appor\ntionment, and Shell cross-appealed the court’s finding of\nliability. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Shell\ndid not qualify as a “traditional” arranger under\n§9607(a)(3), insofar as it had not contracted with B&B to\ndirectly dispose of a hazardous waste product. 520 F. 3d\n918, 948 (CA9 2008). Nevertheless, the court stated that\nShell could still be held liable under a “ ‘broader’ category\nof arranger liability” if the “disposal of hazardous wastes\n[wa]s a foreseeable byproduct of, but not the purpose of,\nthe transaction giving rise to” arranger liability. Ibid.\nRelying on CERCLA’s definition of “disposal,” which cov\ners acts such as “leaking” and “spilling,” 42 U. S. C.\n§6903(3), the Ninth Circuit concluded that an entity could\narrange for “disposal” “even if it did not intend to dispose”\nof a hazardous substance. 520 F. 3d, at 949.\n   Applying that theory of arranger liability to the District\nCourt’s findings of fact, the Ninth Circuit held that Shell\narranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance\nthrough its sale and delivery of D–D:\n     “Shell arranged for delivery of the substances to the\n     site by its subcontractors; was aware of, and to some\n     degree dictated, the transfer arrangements; knew that\n     some leakage was likely in the transfer process; and\n     provided advice and supervision concerning safe\n     transfer and storage. Disposal of a hazardous sub\n     stance was thus a necessary part of the sale and de\n     livery process.” Id., at 950.\n\n——————\nstorage and some washing and rinsing of tanks, other receptacles, and\nchemical application vehicles.     Mixing, formulating, loading, and\nunloading of ag-chemical hazardous substances, which contributed\nmost of the liability causing releases, were predominantly carried out\nby B&B on the B&B parcel.” Id., at 247a–248a.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder such circumstances, the court concluded, arranger\nliability was not precluded by the fact that the purpose of\nShell’s action had been to transport a useful and previ\nously unused product to B&B for sale.\n   On the subject of apportionment, the Court of Appeals\nfound “no dispute” on the question whether the harm\ncaused by Shell and the Railroads was capable of appor\ntionment. Id., at 942. The court observed that a portion of\nthe site contamination occurred before the Railroad parcel\nbecame part of the facility, only some of the hazardous\nsubstances were stored on the Railroad parcel, and “only\nsome of the water on the facility washed over the Rail\nroads’ site.” Ibid. With respect to Shell, the court noted\nthat not all of the hazardous substances spilled on the\nfacility had been sold by Shell. Given those facts, the\ncourt readily concluded that “the contamination traceable\nto the Railroads and Shell, with adequate information,\nwould be allocable, as would be the cost of cleaning up that\ncontamination.” Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals\nheld that the District Court erred in finding that the\nrecord established a reasonable basis for apportionment.\nBecause the burden of proof on the question of apportion\nment rested with Shell and the Railroads, the Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court’s apportionment of\nliability and held Shell and the Railroads jointly and\nseverally liable for the Governments’ cost of responding to\nthe contamination of the Arvin facility.\n   The Railroads and Shell moved for rehearing en banc,\nwhich the Court of Appeals denied over the dissent of\neight judges. See id., at 952 (Bea, J., dissenting). We\ngranted certiorari to determine whether Shell was prop\nerly held liable as an entity that had “arranged for dis\nposal” of hazardous substances within the meaning of\n§9607(a)(3), and whether Shell and the Railroads were\nproperly held liable for all response costs incurred by EPA\nand the State of California.

S. 157, 161\n(2004).6\n   In these cases, it is undisputed that the Railroads qual\nify as PRPs under both §§9607(a)(1) and 9607(a)(2) be\ncause they owned the land leased by B&B at the time of\nthe contamination and continue to own it now. The more\ndifficult question is whether Shell also qualifies as a PRP\nunder §9607(a)(3) by virtue of the circumstances sur\nrounding its sales to B&B.\n   To determine whether Shell may be held liable as an\narranger, we begin with the language of the statute. As\nrelevant here, §9607(a)(3) applies to an entity that “ar\nrange[s] for disposal . . . of hazardous substances.” It is\nplain from the language of the statute that CERCLA\nliability would attach under §9607(a)(3) if an entity were\nto enter into a transaction for the sole purpose of discard\ning a used and no longer useful hazardous substance. It is\nsimilarly clear that an entity could not be held liable as an\narranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the\npurchaser of that product later, and unbeknownst to the\nseller, disposed of the product in a way that led to con\ntamination.

See\nCello-Foil Prods., Inc., 100 F. 3d, at 1231 (“[I]t would be\nerror for us not to recognize the indispensable role that\nstate of mind must play in determining whether a party\nhas ‘otherwise arranged for disposal . . . of hazardous\nsubstances’ ”).\n   The Governments do not deny that the statute requires\nan entity to “arrang[e] for” disposal; however, they inter\npret that phrase by reference to the statutory term “dis\nposal,” which the Act broadly defines as “the discharge,\ndeposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of\nany solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or\nwater.” 42 U. S. C. §6903(3); see also §9601(29) (adopting\nthe definition of “disposal” contained in the Solid Waste\nDisposal Act).7 The Governments assert that by including\nunintentional acts such as “spilling” and “leaking” in the\ndefinition of disposal, Congress intended to impose liabil\nity on entities not only when they directly dispose of waste\nproducts but also when they engage in legitimate sales of\nhazardous substances8 knowing that some disposal may\noccur as a collateral consequence of the sale itself. Apply\ning that reading of the statute, the Governments contend\nthat Shell arranged for the disposal of D–D within the\nmeaning of §9607(a)(3) by shipping D–D to B&B under\nconditions it knew would result in the spilling of a portion\n\n——————\n  7 “Hazardous waste” is defined as “a solid waste, or combination of\n\nsolid wastes, which . . . may . . . pose a substantial present or potential\nhazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated,\nstored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.” §6903(5)(B);\n§9601(29).\n  8 CERCLA defines “hazardous substance” to include a variety of\n\nchemicals and toxins including those designated by EPA as air pollut\nants, water pollutants, and solid wastes. §9601(14).\n12     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the hazardous substance by the purchaser or common\ncarrier. See Brief for United States 24 (“Although the\ndelivery of a useful product was the ultimate purpose of\nthe arrangement, Shell’s continued participation in the\ndelivery, with knowledge that spills and leaks would\nresult, was sufficient to establish Shell’s intent to dispose\nof hazardous substances”). Because these spills resulted\nin wasted D–D, a result Shell anticipated, the Govern\nments insist that Shell was properly found to have ar\nranged for the disposal of D–D.\n  While it is true that in some instances an entity’s knowl\nedge that its product will be leaked, spilled, dumped, or\notherwise discarded may provide evidence of the entity’s\nintent to dispose of its hazardous wastes, knowledge alone\nis insufficient to prove that an entity “planned for” the\ndisposal, particularly when the disposal occurs as a pe\nripheral result of the legitimate sale of an unused, useful\nproduct. In order to qualify as an arranger, Shell must\nhave entered into the sale of D–D with the intention that\nat least a portion of the product be disposed of during the\ntransfer process by one or more of the methods described\nin §6903(3). Here, the facts found by the District Court do\nnot support such a conclusion.\n  Although the evidence adduced at trial showed that\nShell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred\nduring the transfer of D–D from the common carrier to\nB&B’s bulk storage tanks after the product had arrived at\nthe Arvin facility and had come under B&B’s stewardship,\nthe evidence does not support an inference that Shell\nintended such spills to occur. To the contrary, the evi\ndence revealed that Shell took numerous steps to encour\nage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of such spills,\nproviding them with detailed safety manuals, requiring\nthem to maintain adequate storage facilities, and provid\ning discounts for those that took safety precautions. Al\nthough Shell’s efforts were less than wholly successful,\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven these facts, Shell’s mere knowledge that spills and\nleaks continued to occur is insufficient grounds for con\ncluding that Shell “arranged for” the disposal of D–D\nwithin the meaning of §9607(a)(3). Accordingly, we con\nclude that Shell was not liable as an arranger for the\ncontamination that occurred at B&B’s Arvin facility.\n                              III\n   Having concluded that Shell is not liable as an arranger,\nwe need not decide whether the Court of Appeals erred in\nreversing the District Court’s apportionment of Shell’s\nliability for the cost of remediation. We must, however,\ndetermine whether the Railroads were properly held\njointly and severally liable for the full cost of the Govern\nments’ response efforts.\n   The seminal opinion on the subject of apportionment in\nCERCLA actions was written in 1983 by Chief Judge Carl\nRubin of the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio. United States v. Chem-Dyne Corp., 572\nF. Supp. 802. After reviewing CERCLA’s history, Chief\nJudge Rubin concluded that although the Act imposed a\n“strict liability standard,” id., at 805, it did not mandate\n“joint and several” liability in every case. See id., at 807.\nRather, Congress intended the scope of liability to “be\ndetermined from traditional and evolving principles of\ncommon law[.]” Id., at 808. The Chem-Dyne approach has\nbeen fully embraced by the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g.,\nIn re Bell Petroleum Services, Inc., 3 F. 3d 889, 901–902\n(CA5 1993); United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., 964\nF. 2d 252, 268 (CA3 1992); O’Neil v. Picillo, 883 F. 2d 176,\n178 (CA1 1989); United States v. Monsanto Co., 858 F. 2d\n160, 171–173 (CA4 1988).\n   Following Chem-Dyne, the courts of appeals have ac\nknowledged that “[t]he universal starting point for divisi\nbility of harm analyses in CERCLA cases” is §433A of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts. United States v. Hercules,\n14      BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nInc., 247 F. 3d 706, 717 (CA8 2001); Chem-Nuclear Sys\ntems, Inc. v. Bush, 292 F. 3d 254, 259 (CADC 2002);\nUnited States v. R. W. Meyer, Inc., 889 F. 2d 1497, 1507\n(CA6 1989). Under the Restatement,\n     “when two or more persons acting independently\n     caus[e] a distinct or single harm for which there is a\n     reasonable basis for division according to the contri\n     bution of each, each is subject to liability only for the\n     portion of the total harm that he has himself caused.\n     Restatement (Second) of Torts, §§433A, 881 (1976);\n     Prosser, Law of Torts, pp. 313–314 (4th ed. 1971) . . . .\n     But where two or more persons cause a single and in\n     divisible harm, each is subject to liability for the en\n     tire harm. Restatement (Second) of Torts, §875;\n     Prosser, at 315–316.” Chem-Dyne Corp., 572 F. Supp.,\n     at 810.\nIn other words, apportionment is proper when “there is a\nreasonable basis for determining the contribution of each\ncause to a single harm.” Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§433A(1)(b), p. 434 (1963–1964).\n  Not all harms are capable of apportionment, however,\nand CERCLA defendants seeking to avoid joint and sev\neral liability bear the burden of proving that a reasonable\nbasis for apportionment exists. See Chem-Dyne Corp., 572\nF. Supp., at 810 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§433B (1976)) (placing burden of proof on party seeking\napportionment). When two or more causes produce a\nsingle, indivisible harm, “courts have refused to make an\narbitrary apportionment for its own sake, and each of the\ncauses is charged with responsibility for the entire harm.”\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §433A, Comment i, p. 440\n(1963–1964).\n  Neither the parties nor the lower courts dispute the\nprinciples that govern apportionment in CERCLA cases,\nand both the District Court and Court of Appeals agreed\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

The question then is whether the record pro\nvided a reasonable basis for the District Court’s conclusion\nthat the Railroads were liable for only 9% of the harm\ncaused by contamination at the Arvin facility.\n    The District Court criticized the Railroads for taking a\n“ ‘scorched earth,’ all-or-nothing approach to liability,”\nfailing to acknowledge any responsibility for the release of\nhazardous substances that occurred on their parcel\nthroughout the 13-year period of B&B’s lease. According\nto the District Court, the Railroads’ position on liability,\ncombined with the Governments’ refusal to acknowledge\nthe potential divisibility of the harm, complicated the\napportioning of liability. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n07–1601, at 236a–237a (“All parties . . . effectively abdi\ncated providing any helpful arguments to the court and\nhave left the court to independently perform the equitable\napportionment analysis demanded by the circumstances of\nthe case”).9 Yet despite the parties’ failure to assist the\n——————\n  9 As  the Governments point out, insofar as the District Court made\nreference to equitable considerations favoring apportionment, it erred.\nEquitable considerations play no role in the apportionment analysis;\nrather, apportionment is proper only when the evidence supports the\ndivisibility of the damages jointly caused by the PRPs. See generally\nUnited States v. Hercules, Inc., 247 F. 3d 706, 718–719 (CA8 2001);\nUnited States v. Brighton, 153 F. 3d 307, 318–319 (CA6 1998); Redwing\nCarriers, Inc. v. Saraland Apartments, 94 F. 3d 1489, 1513 (CA11\n1996). As the Court of Appeals explained, “[a]pportionment . . . looks to\nwhether defendants may avoid joint and several liability by establish\ning a fixed amount of damage for which they are liable,” while contribu\ntion actions allow jointly and severally liable PRPs to recover from each\nother on the basis of equitable considerations. 520 F. 3d 918, 939–940\n(CA9 2008); see also 42 U. S. C. §9613(f)(1) (providing that, “[i]n resolv\ning contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among\nliable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are\nappropriate”). The error is of no consequence, however, because despite\nthe District Court’s reference to equity, its actual apportionment\n16      BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt in linking the evidence supporting apportionment to\nthe proper allocation of liability, the District Court ulti\nmately concluded that this was “a classic ‘divisible in\nterms of degree’ case, both as to the time period in which\ndefendants’ conduct occurred, and ownership existed, and\nas to the estimated maximum contribution of each party’s\nactivities that released hazardous substances that caused\nSite contamination.” Id., at 239a. Consequently, the\nDistrict Court apportioned liability, assigning the Rail\nroads 9% of the total remediation costs.\n   The District Court calculated the Railroads’ liability\nbased on three figures. First, the court noted that the\nRailroad parcel constituted only 19% of the surface area of\nthe Arvin site. Second, the court observed that the Rail\nroads had leased their parcel to B&B for 13 years, which\nwas only 45% of the time B&B operated the Arvin facility.\nFinally, the court found that the volume of hazardous\nsubstance-releasing activities on the B&B property was at\nleast 10 times greater than the releases that occurred on\nthe Railroad parcel, and it concluded that only spills of\ntwo chemicals, Nemagon and dinoseb (not D–D), substan\ntially contributed to the contamination that had originated\non the Railroad parcel and that those two chemicals had\ncontributed to two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation. The court then multiplied .19 by\n.45 by .66 (two-thirds) and rounded up to determine that\nthe Railroads were responsible for approximately 6% of\nthe remediation costs. “Allowing for calculation errors up\nto 50%,” the court concluded that the Railroads could be\nheld responsible for 9% of the total CERCLA response cost\nfor the Arvin site. Id., at 252a.\n   The Court of Appeals criticized the evidence on which\n—————— \n\ndecision was properly rooted in evidence that provided a reasonable \n\nbasis for identifying the portion of the harm attributable to the Rail\nroads.\n\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court’s conclusions rested, finding a lack of\nsufficient data to establish the precise proportion of con\ntamination that occurred on the relative portions of the\nArvin facility and the rate of contamination in the years\nprior to B&B’s addition of the Railroad parcel. The court\nnoted that neither the duration of the lease nor the size of\nthe leased area alone was a reliable measure of the harm\ncaused by activities on the property owned by the Rail\nroads, and—as the court’s upward adjustment confirmed—\nthe court had relied on estimates rather than specific and\ndetailed records as a basis for its conclusions.\n   Despite these criticisms, we conclude that the facts\ncontained in the record reasonably supported the appor\ntionment of liability. The District Court’s detailed find\nings make it abundantly clear that the primary pollution\nat the Arvin facility was contained in an unlined sump\nand an unlined pond in the southeastern portion of the\nfacility most distant from the Railroads’ parcel and that\nthe spills of hazardous chemicals that occurred on the\nRailroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the\ntotal site contamination, see id., at 247a–248a, some of\nwhich did not require remediation. With those back\nground facts in mind, we are persuaded that it was rea\nsonable for the court to use the size of the leased parcel\nand the duration of the lease as the starting point for its\nanalysis. Although the Court of Appeals faulted the Dis\ntrict Court for relying on the “simplest of considerations:\npercentages of land area, time of ownership, and types of\nhazardous products,” 520 F. 3d, at 943, these were the\nsame factors the court had earlier acknowledged were\nrelevant to the apportionment analysis. See id., at 936,\nn.18 (“We of course agree with our sister circuits that, if\nadequate information is available, divisibility may be\nestablished by ‘volumetric, chronological, or other types of\nevidence,’ including appropriate geographic considera\ntions” (citations omitted)).\n18     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals also criticized the District Court’s\nassumption that spills of Nemagon and dinoseb were\nresponsible for only two-thirds of the chemical spills re\nquiring remediation, observing that each PRP’s share of\nthe total harm was not necessarily equal to the quantity of\npollutants that were deposited on its portion of the total\nfacility. Although the evidence adduced by the parties did\nnot allow the court to calculate precisely the amount of\nhazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to\nthe total site contamination or the exact percentage of\nharm caused by each chemical, the evidence did show that\nfewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that of\nthose spills that occurred, not all were carried across the\nRailroad parcel to the B&B sump and pond from which\nmost of the contamination originated. The fact that no D–\nD spills on the Railroad parcel required remediation lends\nstrength to the District Court’s conclusion that the Rail\nroad parcel contributed only Nemagon and dinoseb in\nquantities requiring remediation.\n   The District Court’s conclusion that those two chemicals\naccounted for only two-thirds of the contamination requir\ning remediation finds less support in the record; however,\nany miscalculation on that point is harmless in light of the\nDistrict Court’s ultimate allocation of liability, which\nincluded a 50% margin of error equal to the 3% reduction\nin liability the District Court provided based on its as\nsessment of the effect of the Nemagon and dinoseb spills.\nHad the District Court limited its apportionment calcula\ntions to the amount of time the Railroad parcel was in use\nand the percentage of the facility located on that parcel, it\nwould have assigned the Railroads 9% of the response\ncost. By including a two-thirds reduction in liability for\nthe Nemagon and dinoseb with a 50% “margin of error,”\nthe District Court reached the same result. Because the\nDistrict Court’s ultimate allocation of liability is supported\nby the evidence and comports with the apportionment\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Relieving Shell of any obligation to pay for\nthe cleanup undertaken by the United States and Califor­\nnia is hardly commanded by CERCLA’s text, and is surely\nat odds with CERCLA’s objective—to place the cost of\nremediation on persons whose activities contributed to the\ncontamination rather than on the taxpaying public.\n    As to apportioning costs, the District Court undertook\nan heroic labor. The Railroads and Shell, the court noted,\nhad pursued a “ ‘scorched earth,’ all-or-nothing approach to\nliability. Neither acknowledged an iota of responsibility\n. . . . Neither party offered helpful arguments to apportion\nliability.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1601, p. 236a,\n¶455. Consequently, the court strived “independently [to]\nperform [an] equitable apportionment analysis.” Id., at\n237a, ¶455. Given the party presentation principle basic\nto our procedural system, Greenlaw v. United States, 554\nU.

Argued February 24, 2009—Decided May 4, 2009*\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Li\n  ability Act (CERCLA) is designed to promote the cleanup of hazard\n  ous waste sites and to ensure that cleanup costs are borne by those\n  responsible for the contamination. In 1960, Brown & Bryant, Inc.\n  (B&B), an agricultural chemical distributor, began operating on a\n  parcel of land located in Arvin, California. B&B later expanded onto\n  an adjacent parcel owned by petitioners Burlington Northern and\n  Santa Fe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company\n  (Railroads). As part of its business, B&B purchased and stored vari\n  ous hazardous chemicals, including the pesticide D–D, which it\n  bought from petitioner Shell Oil Company (Shell). Over time, many\n  of these chemicals spilled during transfers and deliveries, and as a\n  result of equipment failures.\n     Investigations of B&B by the California Department of Toxic Sub\n  stances Control and the federal Environmental Protection Agency\n  (Governments) revealed significant soil and ground water contamina\n  tion and in 1989, the Governments exercised their CERCLA author\n  ity to clean up the Arvin site, spending over $8 million by 1998.\n  Seeking to recover their costs, the Governments initiated legal action\n  against Shell and the Railroads. The District Court ruled in favor of\n  the Governments, finding that both the Railroads and Shell were po\n  tentially responsible parties under CERCLA—the Railroads because\n  they owned part of the facility and Shell because it had “arranged for\n  disposal . . . of hazardous substances,” 42 U. S. C. §9607(a)(3),\n——————\n  * Together with No. 07–1607, Shell Oil Co. v. United States et al., also\non certiorari to the same court.\n2         BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    through D–D’s sale and delivery. The District Court apportioned li\n    ability, holding the Railroads liable for 9% of the Governments’ total\n    response costs, and Shell liable for 6%. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\n    agreed that Shell could be held liable as an arranger under\n    §9607(a)(3) and affirmed the District Court’s decision in that respect.\n    Although the Court of Appeals agreed that the harm in this case was\n    theoretically capable of apportionment, it found the facts present in\n    the record insufficient to support apportionment, and therefore held\n    Shell and the Railroads jointly and severally liable for the Govern\n    ments’ response costs.\nHeld:\n    1. Shell is not liable as an arranger for the contamination at the\n Arvin facility. Section §9607(a)(3) liability may not extend beyond\n the limits of the statute itself. Because CERCLA does not specifically\n define what it means to “arrang[e] for” disposal of a hazardous sub\n stance, the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. In common\n parlance, “arrange” implies action directed to a specific purpose.\n Thus, under §9607(a)(3)’s plain language, an entity may qualify as an\n arranger when it takes intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous\n substance. To qualify as an arranger, Shell must have entered into\n D–D sales with the intent that at least a portion of the product be\n disposed of during the transfer process by one or more of §6903(3)’s\n methods. The facts found by the District Court do not support such a\n conclusion. The evidence shows that Shell was aware that minor, ac\n cidental spills occurred during D–D’s transfer from the common car\n rier to B&B’s storage tanks after the product had come under B&B’s\n stewardship; however, it also reveals that Shell took numerous steps\n to encourage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of spills. Thus,\n Shell’s mere knowledge of continuing spills and leaks is insufficient\n grounds for concluding that it “arranged for” D–D’s disposal. Pp. 8–\n 13.\n    2. The District Court reasonably apportioned the Railroads’ share\n of the site remediation costs at 9%. Calculating liability based on\n three figures—the percentage of the total area of the facility that was\n owned by the Railroads, the duration of B&B’s business divided by\n the term of the Railroads’ lease, and the court’s determination that\n only two polluting chemicals (not D–D) spilled on the leased parcel\n required remediation and that those chemicals were responsible for\n roughly two-thirds of the remediable site contamination—the District\n Court ultimately determined that the Railroads were responsible for\n 9% of the remediation costs. The District Court’s detailed findings\n show that the primary pollution at the site was on a portion of the fa\n cility most distant from the Railroad parcel and that the hazardous\n chemical spills on the Railroad parcel contributed to no more than\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Moreover, although the evidence adduced by the par\n  ties did not allow the District Court to calculate precisely the amount\n  of hazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to the total\n  site contamination or the exact percentage of harm caused by each\n  chemical, the evidence showed that fewer spills occurred on the Rail\n  road parcel and that not all of them crossed to the B&B site, where\n  most of the contamination originated, thus supporting the conclusion\n  that the parcel contributed only two chemicals in quantities requiring\n  remediation.

(B&B), began operating\nan agricultural chemical distribution business, purchasing\npesticides and other chemical products from suppliers\nsuch as Shell Oil Company (Shell). Using its own equip\nment, B&B applied its products to customers’ farms. B&B\nopened its business on a 3.8 acre parcel of former farm\nland in Arvin, California, and in 1975, expanded opera\ntions onto an adjacent .9 acre parcel of land owned jointly\nby the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company,\nand the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (now\nknown respectively as the Burlington Northern and Santa\nFe Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Com\npany) (Railroads). Both parcels of the Arvin facility were\ngraded toward a sump and drainage pond located on the\nsoutheast corner of the primary parcel. See Appendix,\ninfra. Neither the sump nor the drainage pond was lined\nuntil 1979, allowing waste water and chemical runoff from\nthe facility to seep into the ground water below.\n   During its years of operation, B&B stored and distrib\nuted various hazardous chemicals on its property. Among\nthese were the herbicide dinoseb, sold by Dow Chemicals,\nand the pesticides D–D and Nemagon, both sold by Shell.\nDinoseb was stored in 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon con\ntainers on a concrete slab outside B&B’s warehouse.\nNemagon was stored in 30-gallon drums and 5-gallon\ncontainers inside the warehouse. Originally, B&B pur\nchased D–D in 55-gallon drums; beginning in the mid\n1960’s, however, Shell began requiring its distributors to\nmaintain bulk storage facilities for D–D. From that time\nonward, B&B purchased D–D in bulk.1\n——————\n    1 Because   D–D is corrosive, bulk storage of the chemical led to nu\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n    When B&B purchased D–D, Shell would arrange for\ndelivery by common carrier, f.o.b. destination.2 When the\nproduct arrived, it was transferred from tanker trucks to a\nbulk storage tank located on B&B’s primary parcel. From\nthere, the chemical was transferred to bobtail trucks,\nnurse tanks, and pull rigs. During each of these transfers\nleaks and spills could—and often did—occur. Although\nthe common carrier and B&B used buckets to catch spills\nfrom hoses and gaskets connecting the tanker trucks to its\nbulk storage tank, the buckets sometimes overflowed or\nwere knocked over, causing D–D to spill onto the ground\nduring the transfer process.\n    Aware that spills of D–D were commonplace among its\ndistributors, in the late 1970’s Shell took several steps to\nencourage the safe handling of its products. Shell pro\nvided distributors with detailed safety manuals and insti\ntuted a voluntary discount program for distributors that\nmade improvements in their bulk handling and safety\nfacilities. Later, Shell revised its program to require\ndistributors to obtain an inspection by a qualified engineer\nand provide self-certification of compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations. B&B’s Arvin facility was inspected\ntwice, and in 1981, B&B certified to Shell that it had made\na number of recommended improvements to its facilities.\n    Despite these improvements, B&B remained a\n“ ‘[s]loppy’ [o]perator.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–\n1601, p. 130a.

In 1983, the California Department of Toxic\nSubstances Control (DTSC) began investigating B&B’s\nviolation of hazardous waste laws, and the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) soon followed\nsuit, discovering significant contamination of soil and\nground water. Of particular concern was a plume of con\ntaminated ground water located under the facility that\nthreatened to leach into an adjacent supply of potential\ndrinking water.3\n   Although B&B undertook some efforts at remediation,\nby 1989 it had become insolvent and ceased all operations.\nThat same year, the Arvin facility was added to the Na\ntional Priority List, see 54 Fed. Reg. 41027, and subse\nquently, DTSC and EPA (Governments) exercised their\nauthority under 42 U. S. C. §9604 to undertake cleanup\nefforts at the site. By 1998, the Governments had spent\nmore than $8 million responding to the site contamina\ntion; their costs have continued to accrue.\n   In 1991, EPA issued an administrative order to the\nRailroads directing them, as owners of a portion of the\nproperty on which the Arvin facility was located, to per\nform certain remedial tasks in connection with the site.\nThe Railroads did so, incurring expenses of more than $3\nmillion in the process.

Although the B-zone is not currently used as a\nsource of drinking water, it has the potential to serve as such a source.\nNo contamination has yet been found in that zone. The C-zone is an\naquifer located 200 feet below ground. It is the sole current source of\ndrinking water and, thus far, has suffered no contamination from the\nArvin site.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

In 1996, that lawsuit\nwas consolidated with two recovery actions brought by\nDTSC and EPA against Shell and the Railroads.\n  The District Court conducted a 6-week bench trial in\n1999 and four years later entered a judgment in favor of\nthe Governments. In a lengthy order supported by 507\nseparate findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court\nheld that both the Railroads and Shell were potentially\nresponsible parties (PRPs) under CERCLA—the Railroads\nbecause they were owners of a portion of the facility, see\n42 U. S. C. §§9607(a)(1)–(2), and Shell because it had\n“arranged for” the disposal of hazardous substances\nthrough its sale and delivery of D–D, see §9607(a)(3).\n  Although the court found the parties liable, it did not\nimpose joint and several liability on Shell and the Rail\nroads for the entire response cost incurred by the Govern\nments. The court found that the site contamination cre\nated a single harm but concluded that the harm was\ndivisible and therefore capable of apportionment. Based\non three figures—the percentage of the total area of the\nfacility that was owned by the Railroads, the duration of\nB&B’s business divided by the term of the Railroads’ lease,\nand the Court’s determination that only two of three\npolluting chemicals spilled on the leased parcel required\nremediation and that those two chemicals were responsi\nble for roughly two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation—the court apportioned the Rail\nroads’ liability as 9% of the Governments’ total response\ncost.4 Based on estimations of chemicals spills of Shell\n——————\n  4 Although the Railroads did not produce precise figures regarding\n\nthe exact quantity of chemical spills on each parcel in each year of the\nfacility’s operation, the District Court found it “indisputable that the\noverwhelming majority of hazardous substances were released from the\nB&B parcel.” Id., at 248a. The court explained that “the predominant\nactivities conducted on the Railroad parcel through the years were\n6       BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nproducts, the court held Shell liable for 6% of the total site\nresponse cost.\n   The Governments appealed the District Court’s appor\ntionment, and Shell cross-appealed the court’s finding of\nliability. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Shell\ndid not qualify as a “traditional” arranger under\n§9607(a)(3), insofar as it had not contracted with B&B to\ndirectly dispose of a hazardous waste product. 520 F. 3d\n918, 948 (CA9 2008). Nevertheless, the court stated that\nShell could still be held liable under a “ ‘broader’ category\nof arranger liability” if the “disposal of hazardous wastes\n[wa]s a foreseeable byproduct of, but not the purpose of,\nthe transaction giving rise to” arranger liability. Ibid.\nRelying on CERCLA’s definition of “disposal,” which cov\ners acts such as “leaking” and “spilling,” 42 U. S. C.\n§6903(3), the Ninth Circuit concluded that an entity could\narrange for “disposal” “even if it did not intend to dispose”\nof a hazardous substance. 520 F. 3d, at 949.\n   Applying that theory of arranger liability to the District\nCourt’s findings of fact, the Ninth Circuit held that Shell\narranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance\nthrough its sale and delivery of D–D:\n     “Shell arranged for delivery of the substances to the\n     site by its subcontractors; was aware of, and to some\n     degree dictated, the transfer arrangements; knew that\n     some leakage was likely in the transfer process; and\n     provided advice and supervision concerning safe\n     transfer and storage. Disposal of a hazardous sub\n     stance was thus a necessary part of the sale and de\n     livery process.” Id., at 950.\n\n——————\nstorage and some washing and rinsing of tanks, other receptacles, and\nchemical application vehicles.

S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnder such circumstances, the court concluded, arranger\nliability was not precluded by the fact that the purpose of\nShell’s action had been to transport a useful and previ\nously unused product to B&B for sale.\n   On the subject of apportionment, the Court of Appeals\nfound “no dispute” on the question whether the harm\ncaused by Shell and the Railroads was capable of appor\ntionment. Id., at 942. The court observed that a portion of\nthe site contamination occurred before the Railroad parcel\nbecame part of the facility, only some of the hazardous\nsubstances were stored on the Railroad parcel, and “only\nsome of the water on the facility washed over the Rail\nroads’ site.” Ibid. With respect to Shell, the court noted\nthat not all of the hazardous substances spilled on the\nfacility had been sold by Shell. Given those facts, the\ncourt readily concluded that “the contamination traceable\nto the Railroads and Shell, with adequate information,\nwould be allocable, as would be the cost of cleaning up that\ncontamination.” Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals\nheld that the District Court erred in finding that the\nrecord established a reasonable basis for apportionment.\nBecause the burden of proof on the question of apportion\nment rested with Shell and the Railroads, the Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court’s apportionment of\nliability and held Shell and the Railroads jointly and\nseverally liable for the Governments’ cost of responding to\nthe contamination of the Arvin facility.\n   The Railroads and Shell moved for rehearing en banc,\nwhich the Court of Appeals denied over the dissent of\neight judges. See id., at 952 (Bea, J., dissenting). We\ngranted certiorari to determine whether Shell was prop\nerly held liable as an entity that had “arranged for dis\nposal” of hazardous substances within the meaning of\n§9607(a)(3), and whether Shell and the Railroads were\nproperly held liable for all response costs incurred by EPA\nand the State of California.

See Cooper\n——————\n   5 For purposes of the statute, a “person” is defined as “an individual,\n\nfirm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, joint venture,\ncommercial entity, United States Government, State, municipality,\ncommission, political subdivision of a State, or any interstate body.” 42\nU. S. C. §9601(21).\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nIndustries, Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 161\n(2004).6\n   In these cases, it is undisputed that the Railroads qual\nify as PRPs under both §§9607(a)(1) and 9607(a)(2) be\ncause they owned the land leased by B&B at the time of\nthe contamination and continue to own it now. The more\ndifficult question is whether Shell also qualifies as a PRP\nunder §9607(a)(3) by virtue of the circumstances sur\nrounding its sales to B&B.\n   To determine whether Shell may be held liable as an\narranger, we begin with the language of the statute. As\nrelevant here, §9607(a)(3) applies to an entity that “ar\nrange[s] for disposal . . . of hazardous substances.” It is\nplain from the language of the statute that CERCLA\nliability would attach under §9607(a)(3) if an entity were\nto enter into a transaction for the sole purpose of discard\ning a used and no longer useful hazardous substance. It is\nsimilarly clear that an entity could not be held liable as an\narranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the\npurchaser of that product later, and unbeknownst to the\nseller, disposed of the product in a way that led to con\ntamination. See Freeman v. Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., 189\nF. 3d 160, 164 (CA2 1999); Florida Power & Light Co. v.\nAllis Chalmers Corp., 893 F. 2d 1313, 1318 (CA11 1990).\nLess clear is the liability attaching to the many permuta\ntions of “arrangements” that fall between these two ex\n——————\n  6 Under  CERCLA, PRPs are liable for: “(A) all costs of removal or\nremedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State\nor an Indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan;\n  “(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other per\nson consistent with the national contingency plan;\n  “(C) damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources,\nincluding the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or\nloss resulting from such a release; and\n  “(D) the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried\nout under section 9604(i) of this title.” §9607(a)(4).\n10     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntremes—cases in which the seller has some knowledge of\nthe buyers’ planned disposal or whose motives for the\n“sale” of a hazardous substance are less than clear. In\nsuch cases, courts have concluded that the determination\nwhether an entity is an arranger requires a fact-intensive\ninquiry that looks beyond the parties’ characterization of\nthe transaction as a “disposal” or a “sale” and seeks to\ndiscern whether the arrangement was one Congress in\ntended to fall within the scope of CERCLA’s strict-liability\nprovisions. See Freeman, 189 F. 3d, at 164; Pneumo Abex\nCorp. v. High Point, Thomasville & Denton R. Co., 142 F.\n3d 769, 775 (CA4 1998) (“ ‘[T]here is no bright line between\na sale and a disposal under CERCLA.

Because CERCLA does not specifically\ndefine what it means to “arrang[e] for” disposal of a haz\nardous substance, see, e.g., United States v. Cello-Foil\nProds., Inc., 100 F. 3d 1227, 1231 (CA6 1996); Amcast\nIndus. Corp. v.

See\nCello-Foil Prods., Inc., 100 F. 3d, at 1231 (“[I]t would be\nerror for us not to recognize the indispensable role that\nstate of mind must play in determining whether a party\nhas ‘otherwise arranged for disposal . . . of hazardous\nsubstances’ ”).\n   The Governments do not deny that the statute requires\nan entity to “arrang[e] for” disposal; however, they inter\npret that phrase by reference to the statutory term “dis\nposal,” which the Act broadly defines as “the discharge,\ndeposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, or placing of\nany solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or\nwater.” 42 U. S. C. §6903(3); see also §9601(29) (adopting\nthe definition of “disposal” contained in the Solid Waste\nDisposal Act).7 The Governments assert that by including\nunintentional acts such as “spilling” and “leaking” in the\ndefinition of disposal, Congress intended to impose liabil\nity on entities not only when they directly dispose of waste\nproducts but also when they engage in legitimate sales of\nhazardous substances8 knowing that some disposal may\noccur as a collateral consequence of the sale itself. Apply\ning that reading of the statute, the Governments contend\nthat Shell arranged for the disposal of D–D within the\nmeaning of §9607(a)(3) by shipping D–D to B&B under\nconditions it knew would result in the spilling of a portion\n\n——————\n  7 “Hazardous waste” is defined as “a solid waste, or combination of\n\nsolid wastes, which . . . may . . . pose a substantial present or potential\nhazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated,\nstored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.” §6903(5)(B);\n§9601(29).\n  8 CERCLA defines “hazardous substance” to include a variety of\n\nchemicals and toxins including those designated by EPA as air pollut\nants, water pollutants, and solid wastes. §9601(14).\n12     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the hazardous substance by the purchaser or common\ncarrier. See Brief for United States 24 (“Although the\ndelivery of a useful product was the ultimate purpose of\nthe arrangement, Shell’s continued participation in the\ndelivery, with knowledge that spills and leaks would\nresult, was sufficient to establish Shell’s intent to dispose\nof hazardous substances”). Because these spills resulted\nin wasted D–D, a result Shell anticipated, the Govern\nments insist that Shell was properly found to have ar\nranged for the disposal of D–D.\n  While it is true that in some instances an entity’s knowl\nedge that its product will be leaked, spilled, dumped, or\notherwise discarded may provide evidence of the entity’s\nintent to dispose of its hazardous wastes, knowledge alone\nis insufficient to prove that an entity “planned for” the\ndisposal, particularly when the disposal occurs as a pe\nripheral result of the legitimate sale of an unused, useful\nproduct. In order to qualify as an arranger, Shell must\nhave entered into the sale of D–D with the intention that\nat least a portion of the product be disposed of during the\ntransfer process by one or more of the methods described\nin §6903(3). Here, the facts found by the District Court do\nnot support such a conclusion.\n  Although the evidence adduced at trial showed that\nShell was aware that minor, accidental spills occurred\nduring the transfer of D–D from the common carrier to\nB&B’s bulk storage tanks after the product had arrived at\nthe Arvin facility and had come under B&B’s stewardship,\nthe evidence does not support an inference that Shell\nintended such spills to occur. To the contrary, the evi\ndence revealed that Shell took numerous steps to encour\nage its distributors to reduce the likelihood of such spills,\nproviding them with detailed safety manuals, requiring\nthem to maintain adequate storage facilities, and provid\ning discounts for those that took safety precautions. Al\nthough Shell’s efforts were less than wholly successful,\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven these facts, Shell’s mere knowledge that spills and\nleaks continued to occur is insufficient grounds for con\ncluding that Shell “arranged for” the disposal of D–D\nwithin the meaning of §9607(a)(3). Accordingly, we con\nclude that Shell was not liable as an arranger for the\ncontamination that occurred at B&B’s Arvin facility.\n                              III\n   Having concluded that Shell is not liable as an arranger,\nwe need not decide whether the Court of Appeals erred in\nreversing the District Court’s apportionment of Shell’s\nliability for the cost of remediation. We must, however,\ndetermine whether the Railroads were properly held\njointly and severally liable for the full cost of the Govern\nments’ response efforts.\n   The seminal opinion on the subject of apportionment in\nCERCLA actions was written in 1983 by Chief Judge Carl\nRubin of the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Ohio. United States v. Chem-Dyne Corp., 572\nF. Supp. 802. After reviewing CERCLA’s history, Chief\nJudge Rubin concluded that although the Act imposed a\n“strict liability standard,” id., at 805, it did not mandate\n“joint and several” liability in every case. See id., at 807.\nRather, Congress intended the scope of liability to “be\ndetermined from traditional and evolving principles of\ncommon law[.]” Id., at 808. The Chem-Dyne approach has\nbeen fully embraced by the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g.,\nIn re Bell Petroleum Services, Inc., 3 F. 3d 889, 901–902\n(CA5 1993); United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., 964\nF. 2d 252, 268 (CA3 1992); O’Neil v. Picillo, 883 F. 2d 176,\n178 (CA1 1989); United States v. Monsanto Co., 858 F. 2d\n160, 171–173 (CA4 1988).\n   Following Chem-Dyne, the courts of appeals have ac\nknowledged that “[t]he universal starting point for divisi\nbility of harm analyses in CERCLA cases” is §433A of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts. United States v. Hercules,\n14      BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nInc., 247 F. 3d 706, 717 (CA8 2001); Chem-Nuclear Sys\ntems, Inc. v. Bush, 292 F. 3d 254, 259 (CADC 2002);\nUnited States v. R. W. Meyer, Inc., 889 F. 2d 1497, 1507\n(CA6 1989). Under the Restatement,\n     “when two or more persons acting independently\n     caus[e] a distinct or single harm for which there is a\n     reasonable basis for division according to the contri\n     bution of each, each is subject to liability only for the\n     portion of the total harm that he has himself caused.\n     Restatement (Second) of Torts, §§433A, 881 (1976);\n     Prosser, Law of Torts, pp. 313–314 (4th ed. 1971) . . . .\n     But where two or more persons cause a single and in\n     divisible harm, each is subject to liability for the en\n     tire harm. Restatement (Second) of Torts, §875;\n     Prosser, at 315–316.” Chem-Dyne Corp., 572 F. Supp.,\n     at 810.\nIn other words, apportionment is proper when “there is a\nreasonable basis for determining the contribution of each\ncause to a single harm.” Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§433A(1)(b), p. 434 (1963–1964).\n  Not all harms are capable of apportionment, however,\nand CERCLA defendants seeking to avoid joint and sev\neral liability bear the burden of proving that a reasonable\nbasis for apportionment exists. See Chem-Dyne Corp., 572\nF. Supp., at 810 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts\n§433B (1976)) (placing burden of proof on party seeking\napportionment). When two or more causes produce a\nsingle, indivisible harm, “courts have refused to make an\narbitrary apportionment for its own sake, and each of the\ncauses is charged with responsibility for the entire harm.”\nRestatement (Second) of Torts §433A, Comment i, p. 440\n(1963–1964).\n  Neither the parties nor the lower courts dispute the\nprinciples that govern apportionment in CERCLA cases,\nand both the District Court and Court of Appeals agreed\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the harm created by the contamination of the Arvin\nsite, although singular, was theoretically capable of appor\ntionment. The question then is whether the record pro\nvided a reasonable basis for the District Court’s conclusion\nthat the Railroads were liable for only 9% of the harm\ncaused by contamination at the Arvin facility.\n    The District Court criticized the Railroads for taking a\n“ ‘scorched earth,’ all-or-nothing approach to liability,”\nfailing to acknowledge any responsibility for the release of\nhazardous substances that occurred on their parcel\nthroughout the 13-year period of B&B’s lease. According\nto the District Court, the Railroads’ position on liability,\ncombined with the Governments’ refusal to acknowledge\nthe potential divisibility of the harm, complicated the\napportioning of liability. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n07–1601, at 236a–237a (“All parties . . . effectively abdi\ncated providing any helpful arguments to the court and\nhave left the court to independently perform the equitable\napportionment analysis demanded by the circumstances of\nthe case”).9 Yet despite the parties’ failure to assist the\n——————\n  9 As  the Governments point out, insofar as the District Court made\nreference to equitable considerations favoring apportionment, it erred.\nEquitable considerations play no role in the apportionment analysis;\nrather, apportionment is proper only when the evidence supports the\ndivisibility of the damages jointly caused by the PRPs. See generally\nUnited States v. Hercules, Inc., 247 F. 3d 706, 718–719 (CA8 2001);\nUnited States v. Brighton, 153 F. 3d 307, 318–319 (CA6 1998); Redwing\nCarriers, Inc. v. Saraland Apartments, 94 F. 3d 1489, 1513 (CA11\n1996). As the Court of Appeals explained, “[a]pportionment . . . looks to\nwhether defendants may avoid joint and several liability by establish\ning a fixed amount of damage for which they are liable,” while contribu\ntion actions allow jointly and severally liable PRPs to recover from each\nother on the basis of equitable considerations. 520 F. 3d 918, 939–940\n(CA9 2008); see also 42 U. S. C. §9613(f)(1) (providing that, “[i]n resolv\ning contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among\nliable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are\nappropriate”). The error is of no consequence, however, because despite\nthe District Court’s reference to equity, its actual apportionment\n16      BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt in linking the evidence supporting apportionment to\nthe proper allocation of liability, the District Court ulti\nmately concluded that this was “a classic ‘divisible in\nterms of degree’ case, both as to the time period in which\ndefendants’ conduct occurred, and ownership existed, and\nas to the estimated maximum contribution of each party’s\nactivities that released hazardous substances that caused\nSite contamination.” Id., at 239a. Consequently, the\nDistrict Court apportioned liability, assigning the Rail\nroads 9% of the total remediation costs.\n   The District Court calculated the Railroads’ liability\nbased on three figures. First, the court noted that the\nRailroad parcel constituted only 19% of the surface area of\nthe Arvin site. Second, the court observed that the Rail\nroads had leased their parcel to B&B for 13 years, which\nwas only 45% of the time B&B operated the Arvin facility.\nFinally, the court found that the volume of hazardous\nsubstance-releasing activities on the B&B property was at\nleast 10 times greater than the releases that occurred on\nthe Railroad parcel, and it concluded that only spills of\ntwo chemicals, Nemagon and dinoseb (not D–D), substan\ntially contributed to the contamination that had originated\non the Railroad parcel and that those two chemicals had\ncontributed to two-thirds of the overall site contamination\nrequiring remediation. The court then multiplied .19 by\n.45 by .66 (two-thirds) and rounded up to determine that\nthe Railroads were responsible for approximately 6% of\nthe remediation costs. “Allowing for calculation errors up\nto 50%,” the court concluded that the Railroads could be\nheld responsible for 9% of the total CERCLA response cost\nfor the Arvin site. Id., at 252a.\n   The Court of Appeals criticized the evidence on which\n—————— \n\ndecision was properly rooted in evidence that provided a reasonable \n\nbasis for identifying the portion of the harm attributable to the Rail\nroads.\n\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court’s conclusions rested, finding a lack of\nsufficient data to establish the precise proportion of con\ntamination that occurred on the relative portions of the\nArvin facility and the rate of contamination in the years\nprior to B&B’s addition of the Railroad parcel. The court\nnoted that neither the duration of the lease nor the size of\nthe leased area alone was a reliable measure of the harm\ncaused by activities on the property owned by the Rail\nroads, and—as the court’s upward adjustment confirmed—\nthe court had relied on estimates rather than specific and\ndetailed records as a basis for its conclusions.\n   Despite these criticisms, we conclude that the facts\ncontained in the record reasonably supported the appor\ntionment of liability. The District Court’s detailed find\nings make it abundantly clear that the primary pollution\nat the Arvin facility was contained in an unlined sump\nand an unlined pond in the southeastern portion of the\nfacility most distant from the Railroads’ parcel and that\nthe spills of hazardous chemicals that occurred on the\nRailroad parcel contributed to no more than 10% of the\ntotal site contamination, see id., at 247a–248a, some of\nwhich did not require remediation. With those back\nground facts in mind, we are persuaded that it was rea\nsonable for the court to use the size of the leased parcel\nand the duration of the lease as the starting point for its\nanalysis. Although the Court of Appeals faulted the Dis\ntrict Court for relying on the “simplest of considerations:\npercentages of land area, time of ownership, and types of\nhazardous products,” 520 F. 3d, at 943, these were the\nsame factors the court had earlier acknowledged were\nrelevant to the apportionment analysis. See id., at 936,\nn.18 (“We of course agree with our sister circuits that, if\nadequate information is available, divisibility may be\nestablished by ‘volumetric, chronological, or other types of\nevidence,’ including appropriate geographic considera\ntions” (citations omitted)).\n18     BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals also criticized the District Court’s\nassumption that spills of Nemagon and dinoseb were\nresponsible for only two-thirds of the chemical spills re\nquiring remediation, observing that each PRP’s share of\nthe total harm was not necessarily equal to the quantity of\npollutants that were deposited on its portion of the total\nfacility. Although the evidence adduced by the parties did\nnot allow the court to calculate precisely the amount of\nhazardous chemicals contributed by the Railroad parcel to\nthe total site contamination or the exact percentage of\nharm caused by each chemical, the evidence did show that\nfewer spills occurred on the Railroad parcel and that of\nthose spills that occurred, not all were carried across the\nRailroad parcel to the B&B sump and pond from which\nmost of the contamination originated. The fact that no D–\nD spills on the Railroad parcel required remediation lends\nstrength to the District Court’s conclusion that the Rail\nroad parcel contributed only Nemagon and dinoseb in\nquantities requiring remediation.\n   The District Court’s conclusion that those two chemicals\naccounted for only two-thirds of the contamination requir\ning remediation finds less support in the record; however,\nany miscalculation on that point is harmless in light of the\nDistrict Court’s ultimate allocation of liability, which\nincluded a 50% margin of error equal to the 3% reduction\nin liability the District Court provided based on its as\nsessment of the effect of the Nemagon and dinoseb spills.\nHad the District Court limited its apportionment calcula\ntions to the amount of time the Railroad parcel was in use\nand the percentage of the facility located on that parcel, it\nwould have assigned the Railroads 9% of the response\ncost. By including a two-thirds reduction in liability for\nthe Nemagon and dinoseb with a 50% “margin of error,”\nthe District Court reached the same result. Because the\nDistrict Court’s ultimate allocation of liability is supported\nby the evidence and comports with the apportionment\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

As the facts\nfound by the District Court bear out, App. to Pet. for Cert.\nin No. 07–1601, pp. 113a–129a, 208a–213a, Shell “ar­\nranged for disposal . . . of hazardous substances” owned by\nShell when the arrangements were made.1\n  In the 1950’s and early 1960’s, Shell shipped most of its\nproducts to Brown and Bryant (B&B) in 55-gallon drums,\nthereby ensuring against spillage or leakage during deliv­\nery and transfer. Id., at 89a, 115a. Later, Shell found it\neconomically advantageous, in lieu of shipping in drums,\n——————\n  1 “Disposal”   is defined in 42 U. S. C. §6903(3) to include “spilling [or]\nleaking” of “any . . . hazardous waste into or on any land or water so\nthat [the] . . . hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the\nenvironment or be emitted into the air or discharged into any waters.”\n2        BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nto require B&B to maintain bulk storage facilities for\nreceipt of the chemicals B&B purchased from Shell. Id., at\n115a. By the mid-1960’s, Shell was delivering its chemical\nto B&B in bulk tank truckloads. Id., at 89a, 115a. As the\nCourt recognizes, “bulk storage of the chemical led to\nnumerous tank failures and spills as the chemical rusted\ntanks and eroded valves.” Ante, at 2–3, n. 1.\n  Shell furthermore specified the equipment to be used in\ntransferring the chemicals from the delivery truck to\nB&B’s storage tanks. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–\n1601, pp. 120a–122a, 124a.2 In the process, spills and\nleaks were inevitable, indeed spills occurred every time\ndeliveries were made. 520 F. 3d 918, 950–951 (CA9 2008).\nSee also App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1601, pp. 119a–\n122a (“It is undisputed that spills were inherent in the\ndelivery process that Shell arranged . . . .”).\n  That Shell sold B&B useful products, the Ninth Circuit\nobserved, did not exonerate Shell from CERCLA liability,\nfor the sales “necessarily and immediately result[ed] in\nthe leakage of hazardous substances.” 520 F. 3d, at 950.\nThe deliveries, Shell was well aware, directly and rou­\ntinely resulted in disposals of hazardous substances\n(through spills and leaks) for more than 20 years. “[M]ere\nknowledge” may not be enough, ante, at 13, but Shell did\nnot simply know of the spills and leaks without contribut­\ning to them. Given the control rein held by Shell over the\nmode of delivery and transfer, 520 F. 3d, at 950–951, the\n\n——————\n   2 Shell shipped the chemicals to B&B “F.O.B. Destination.” At oral\n\nargument, the Court asked Shell’s counsel: Suppose there had been “no\ntransfer of ownership until the delivery [was] complete?” In that event,\ncounsel responded, “Shell would have been the owner of the waste.” Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 8. The Court credits the fact that at the time of the spills,\nthe chemicals, having been shipped “F.O.B. Destination,” “had come\nunder B&B’s stewardship.” Ante, at 12. In my view, CERCLA liability,\nor the absence thereof, should not turn, in any part, on such an emi­\nnently shipper-fixable specification as “F.O.B. Destination.”\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nlower courts held and I agree, Shell was properly ranked\nan arranger. Relieving Shell of any obligation to pay for\nthe cleanup undertaken by the United States and Califor­\nnia is hardly commanded by CERCLA’s text, and is surely\nat odds with CERCLA’s objective—to place the cost of\nremediation on persons whose activities contributed to the\ncontamination rather than on the taxpaying public.\n    As to apportioning costs, the District Court undertook\nan heroic labor. The Railroads and Shell, the court noted,\nhad pursued a “ ‘scorched earth,’ all-or-nothing approach to\nliability. Neither acknowledged an iota of responsibility\n. . . . Neither party offered helpful arguments to apportion\nliability.” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07–1601, p. 236a,\n¶455. Consequently, the court strived “independently [to]\nperform [an] equitable apportionment analysis.” Id., at\n237a, ¶455. Given the party presentation principle basic\nto our procedural system, Greenlaw v. United States, 554\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 5), it is questionable\nwhether the court should have pursued the matter sua\nsponte. See Castro v. United States, 540 U. S. 375, 386\n(2003) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“Our adversary system is\ndesigned around the premise that the parties know what\nis best for them, and are responsible for advancing the\nfacts and arguments entitling them to relief.”). Cf. Kap­\nlan, von Mehren, & Schaefer, Phases of German Civil\nProcedure I, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1193, 1224 (1958) (describ­\ning court’s obligation, under Germany’s Code of Civil\nProcedure, to see to it that the case is fully developed).\n    The trial court’s mode of procedure, the United States\nurged before this Court, “deprived the government of a fair\nopportunity to respond to the court’s theories of appor­\ntionment and to rebut their factual underpinnings—an\nopportunity the governmen[t] would have had if those\ntheories had been advanced by petitioners themselves.”\n4        BURLINGTON N. & S. F. R. CO. v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nBrief for United States 41.3 I would return these cases to\nthe District Court to give all parties a fair opportunity to\naddress that court’s endeavor to allocate costs. Because\nthe Court’s disposition precludes that opportunity, I dis­\nsent from the Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n   3 For example, on brief, the United States observed: “[P]etitioners\n\nidentify no record support for the district court’s assumption that each\nparty’s contribution to the overall harm is proportional to the relative\nvolume of hazardous substances attributable to it.” Brief for United\nStates 45. And at oral argument, counsel for the United States\nstressed that the District Court “framed the relevant inquiry as what\npercentage of the contamination was attributable to the railroad parcel,\nto the Shell-controlled deliveries, and to the B&B parcel. But it made\nno finding . . . as to what the cost of [remediation] would have been . . .\nif the only source of contamination had been the railroad parcel.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 52. See also id., at 56 (“[T]he crucial question is what re­\nsponse costs the government would have been required to bear . . . if\nonly the railroad parcel’s contamination had been at issue . . . .”).\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145879/", "sha1": "c5c202ba006326bce7386fc85f6a18ad931f6edc", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-052", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:53"}
