UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08–5274. Argued March 4, 2009—Decided April 29, 2009\nAn individual convicted for using or carrying a firearm during and in\n relation to any violent or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a fire\n arm in furtherance of such a crime, receives a 5-year mandatory\n minimum sentence, in addition to the punishment for the underlying\n crime. 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum in\n creases to 7 years “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if\n the firearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).\n    Petitioner Dean was convicted of conspiring to commit a bank rob\n bery and discharging a firearm during an armed robbery. Because\n the firearm was “discharged” during the robbery, Dean was sen\n tenced to a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term on the firearm\n count. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). On appeal, he contended that the discharge\n was accidental, and that §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the de\n fendant intended to discharge the firearm. The Eleventh Circuit af\n firmed, holding that no proof of intent is required.\nHeld: Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of intent. The\n 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the\n course of a violent or drug trafficking crime, whether on purpose or\n by accident. Pp. 2–9.\n    (a) Subsection (iii) provides a minimum 10-year sentence “if the\n firearm is discharged.” It does not require that the discharge be done\n knowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of limitation.\n This Court “ordinarily resist[s] reading words or elements into a\n statute that do not appear on its face.” Bates v. United States, 522\n U. S. 23, 29. Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates\n that subsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. Cf. Watson v.\n United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___. The statute’s structure also sug\n gests no such limitation. Congress expressly included an intent re\n2                       DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    quirement for the 7-year mandatory minimum for brandishing a fire\n    arm by separately defining “brandish” to require that the firearm be\n    displayed “in order to intimidate” another person. §924(c)(4). Con\n    gress did not, however, separately define “discharge” to include an in\n    tent requirement. It is generally presumed that Congress acts inten\n    tionally when including particular language in one section of a\n    statute but not in another. Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,\n    23. Contrary to Dean’s contention, the phrase “during and in relation\n    to” in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A) does not modify “is dis\n    charged,” which appears in a separate subsection and in a different\n    voice than the principal paragraph. “[I]n relation to” is most natu\n    rally read to modify only the nearby verbs “uses” and “carries.” This\n    reading will not lead to the absurd results posited by Dean. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) Dean argues that subsection (iii) must be limited to intentional\n    discharges in order to give effect to the statute’s progression of\n    harsher penalties for increasingly culpable conduct. While it is un\n    usual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely\n    accidental conduct, it is not unusual to punish individuals for the un\n    intended consequences of their unlawful acts. The fact that the dis\n    charge may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blame\n    less. The sentencing enhancement accounts for the risk of harm\n    resulting from the manner in which the crime is carried out, for\n    which the defendant is responsible. See Harris v. United States, 536\n    U. S. 545, 553. An individual bringing a loaded weapon to commit a\n    crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally. A gun\n    shot—whether accidental or intended—increases the risk that others\n    will be injured, that people will panic, or that violence will be used in\n    response. It also traumatizes bystanders, as it did here. Pp. 6–9.\n       (c) Because the statutory text and structure demonstrate that the\n    discharge provision does not contain an intent requirement, the rule\n    of lenity is not implicated in this case.\n517 F. 3d 1224, affirmed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 29, 2009] \n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  Accidents happen. Sometimes they happen to individu\nals committing crimes with loaded guns. The question\nhere is whether extra punishment Congress imposed for\nthe discharge of a gun during certain crimes applies when\nthe gun goes off accidentally.\n                              I\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or\ncarrying a firearm during and in relation to any violent or\ndrug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in further\nance of such a crime. An individual convicted of that\noffense receives a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, in\naddition to the punishment for the underlying crime.\n§924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum increases to 7\nyears “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if the\nfirearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).\n   In this case, a masked man entered a bank, waved a\ngun, and yelled at everyone to get down. He then walked\nbehind the teller counter and started removing money\nfrom the teller stations. He grabbed bills with his left\n2                   DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nhand, holding the gun in his right. At one point, he\nreached over a teller to remove money from her drawer.\nAs he was collecting the money, the gun discharged, leav\ning a bullet hole in the partition between two stations.\nThe robber cursed and dashed out of the bank. Witnesses\nlater testified that he seemed surprised that the gun had\ngone off. No one was hurt. App. 16–19, 24, 27, 47–48, 79.\n   Police arrested Christopher Michael Dean and Ricardo\nCurtis Lopez for the crime. Both defendants were charged\nwith conspiracy to commit a robbery affecting interstate\ncommerce, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1951(a), and aiding\nand abetting each other in using, carrying, possessing, and\ndischarging a firearm during an armed robbery, in viola\ntion of §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and §2. App. 11–12. At trial,\nDean admitted that he had committed the robbery, id., at\n76–81, and a jury found him guilty on both the robbery\nand firearm counts. The District Court sentenced Dean to\na mandatory minimum term of 10 years in prison on the\nfirearm count, because the firearm “discharged” during\nthe robbery. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii); App. 136.\n   Dean appealed, contending that the discharge was\naccidental, and that the sentencing enhancement in\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the defendant in\ntended to discharge the firearm. The Court of Appeals\naffirmed, holding that separate proof of intent was not\nrequired. 517 F. 3d 1224, 1229 (CA11 2008). That deci\nsion created a conflict among the Circuits over whether\nthe accidental discharge of a firearm during the specified\ncrimes gives rise to the 10-year mandatory minimum. See\nUnited States v. Brown, 449 F. 3d 154 (CADC 2006) (hold\ning that it does not). We granted certiorari to resolve that\nconflict. 555 U. S. ____ (2008).\n                               II\n    Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides:\n      “[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or\n    carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such\n    crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the\n    punishment provided for such crime of violence or\n    drug trafficking crime—\n      “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n    less than 5 years;\n      “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n      “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”\n   The principal paragraph defines a complete offense and\nthe subsections “explain how defendants are to ‘be sen\ntenced.’ ” Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552\n(2002). Subsection (i) “sets a catchall minimum” sentence\nof not less than five years. Id., at 552–553. Subsections\n(ii) and (iii) increase the minimum penalty if the firearm\n“is brandished” or “is discharged.” See id., at 553. The\nparties disagree over whether §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains a\nrequirement that the defendant intend to discharge the\nfirearm. We hold that it does not.\n                               A\n  “We start, as always, with the language of the statute.”\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000). The text of\nsubsection (iii) provides that a defendant shall be sen\ntenced to a minimum of 10 years “if the firearm is dis\ncharged.” It does not require that the discharge be done\nknowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of\nlimitation. As we explained in Bates v. United States, 522\nU. S. 23 (1997), in declining to infer an “ ‘intent to de\nfraud’ ” requirement into a statute, “we ordinarily resist\nreading words or elements into a statute that do not ap\npear on its face.” Id., at 29.\n  Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates that\nsubsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. The pas\n4                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsive voice focuses on an event that occurs without respect\nto a specific actor, and therefore without respect to any\nactor’s intent or culpability. Cf. Watson v. United States,\n552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7) (use of passive\nvoice in statutory phrase “to be used” in 18 U. S. C.\n§924(d)(1) reflects “agnosticism . . . about who does the\nusing”). It is whether something happened—not how or\nwhy it happened—that matters.\n   The structure of the statute also suggests that subsec\ntion (iii) is not limited to the intentional discharge of a\nfirearm. Subsection (ii) provides a 7-year mandatory\nminimum sentence if the firearm “is brandished.” Con\ngress expressly included an intent requirement for that\nprovision, by defining “brandish” to mean “to display all or\npart of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the\nfirearm known to another person, in order to intimidate\nthat person.” §924(c)(4) (emphasis added). The defendant\nmust have intended to brandish the firearm, because the\nbrandishing must have been done for a specific purpose.\nCongress did not, however, separately define “discharge”\nto include an intent requirement. “[W]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russello v. United\nStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Dean argues that the statute is not silent on the ques\ntion presented. Congress, he contends, included an intent\nelement in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A), and\nthat element extends to the sentencing enhancements.\nSection 924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or carrying a fire\narm “during and in relation to” any violent or drug traf\nficking crime. In Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223\n(1993), we stated that the phrase “in relation to” means\n“that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrespect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or in\nvolvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.”\nId., at 238. Dean argues that the adverbial phrase thus\nnecessarily embodies an intent requirement, and that the\nphrase modifies all the verbs in the statute—not only use,\ncarry, and possess, but also brandish and discharge. Such\na reading requires that a perpetrator knowingly discharge\nthe firearm for the enhancement to apply. If the discharge\nis accidental, Dean argues, it is not “in relation to” the\nunderlying crime.\n   The most natural reading of the statute, however, is\nthat “in relation to” modifies only the nearby verbs “uses”\nand “carries.” The next verb—“possesses”—is modified by\nits own adverbial clause, “in furtherance of.” The last two\nverbs—“is brandished” and “is discharged”—appear in\nseparate subsections and are in a different voice than the\nverbs in the principal paragraph. There is no basis for\nreading “in relation to” to extend all the way down to\nmodify “is discharged.” The better reading of the statute\nis that the adverbial phrases in the opening paragraph—\n“in relation to” and “in furtherance of”—modify their\nrespective nearby verbs, and that neither phrase extends\nto the sentencing factors.\n   But, Dean argues, such a reading will lead to absurd\nresults. The discharge provision on its face contains no\ntemporal or causal limitations. In the absence of an intent\nrequirement, the enhancement would apply “regardless of\nwhen the actions occur, or by whom or for what reason\nthey are taken.” Brief for Petitioner 11–12. It would, for\nexample, apply if the gun used during the crime were\ndischarged “weeks (or years) before or after the crime.”\nReply Brief for Petitioner 11.\n   We do not agree that implying an intent requirement is\nnecessary to address such concerns. As the Government\nrecognizes, sentencing factors such as the one here “often\ninvolve . . . special features of the manner in which a basic\n6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncrime was carried out.” Brief for United States 29 (quot\ning Harris, 536 U. S., at 553; internal quotation marks\nomitted). The basic crime here is using or carrying a\nfirearm during and in relation to a violent or drug traffick\ning crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of any\nsuch crime. Fanciful hypotheticals testing whether the\ndischarge was a “special featur[e]” of how the “basic crime\nwas carried out,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 553 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), are best addressed in those terms,\nnot by contorting and stretching the statutory language to\nimply an intent requirement.\n                              B\n   Dean further argues that even if the statute is viewed as\nsilent on the intent question, that silence compels a ruling\nin his favor. There is, he notes, a presumption that crimi\nnal prohibitions include a requirement that the Govern\nment prove the defendant intended the conduct made\ncriminal. In light of this presumption, we have “on a\nnumber of occasions read a state-of-mind component into\nan offense even when the statutory definition did not in\nterms so provide.” United States v. United States Gypsum\nCo., 438 U. S. 422, 437 (1978). “[S]ome indication of con\ngressional intent, express or implied, is required to dis\npense with mens rea as an element of a crime.” Staples v.\nUnited States, 511 U. S. 600, 606 (1994).\n   Dean argues that the presumption is especially strong\nin this case, given the structure and purpose of the stat\nute. In his view, the three subsections are intended to\nprovide harsher penalties for increasingly culpable con\nduct: a 5-year minimum for using, carrying, or possessing\na firearm; a 7-year minimum for brandishing a firearm;\nand a 10-year minimum for discharging a firearm. Incor\nporating an intent requirement into the discharge provi\nsion is necessary to give effect to that progression, because\nan accidental discharge is less culpable than intentional\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbrandishment. See Brown, 449 F. 3d, at 156.\n   It is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the\nconsequences of purely accidental conduct. But it is not\nunusual to punish individuals for the unintended conse\nquences of their unlawful acts. See 2 W. LaFave, Sub\nstantive Criminal Law §14.4, pp. 436–437 (2d ed. 2003).\nThe felony-murder rule is a familiar example: If a defen\ndant commits an unintended homicide while committing\nanother felony, the defendant can be convicted of murder.\nSee 18 U. S. C. §1111. The Sentencing Guidelines reflect\nthe same principle. See United States Sentencing Com\nmission, Guidelines Manual §2A2.2(b)(3) (Nov. 2008)\n(USSG) (increasing offense level for aggravated assault\naccording to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3 (in\ncreasing offense level for operating or directing the opera\ntion of a common carrier under the influence of alcohol or\ndrugs if death or serious bodily injury results).\n   Blackstone expressed the idea in the following terms:\n    “[I]f any accidental mischief happens to follow from\n    the performance of a lawful act, the party stands ex\n    cused from all guilt: but if a man be doing any thing\n    unlawful, and a consequence ensues which he did not\n    foresee or intend, as the death of a man or the like, his\n    want of foresight shall be no excuse; for, being guilty\n    of one offence, in doing antecedently what is in itself\n    unlawful, he is criminally guilty of whatever conse\n    quence may follow the first misbehaviour.” 4 W.\n    Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n    26–27 (1769).\nHere the defendant is already guilty of unlawful conduct\ntwice over: a violent or drug trafficking offense and the\nuse, carrying, or possession of a firearm in the course of\nthat offense. That unlawful conduct was not an accident.\nSee Smith, 508 U. S., at 238.\n  The fact that the actual discharge of a gun covered\n8                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) may be accidental does not mean\nthat the defendant is blameless. The sentencing en\nhancement in subsection (iii) accounts for the risk of harm\nresulting from the manner in which the crime is carried\nout, for which the defendant is responsible. See Harris,\nsupra, at 553. An individual who brings a loaded weapon\nto commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will dis\ncharge accidentally. A gunshot in such circumstances—\nwhether accidental or intended—increases the risk that\nothers will be injured, that people will panic, or that vio\nlence (with its own danger to those nearby) will be used in\nresponse. Those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for\nan inadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm,\nhandle it with care during the underlying violent or drug\ntrafficking crime, leave the gun at home, or—best yet—\navoid committing the felony in the first place.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS contends that the statute should be\nread to require a showing of intent because harm resulting\nfrom a discharge may be punishable under other provi\nsions, such as the Sentencing Guidelines (but only if “bod\nily injury” results). Post, at 6 (dissenting opinion) (citing\nUSSG §2B3.1(b)(3)). But Congress in §924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\nelected to impose a mandatory term, without regard to\nmore generally applicable sentencing provisions. Punish\nment available under such provisions therefore does not\nsuggest that the statute at issue here is limited to inten\ntional discharges.\n   And although the point is not relevant under the correct\nreading of the statute, it is wrong to assert that the gun\nshot here “caused no harm.” Post, at 1. By pure luck, no\none was killed or wounded. But the gunshot plainly added\nto the trauma experienced by those held during the armed\nrobbery. See, e.g., App. 22 (the gunshot “shook us all”);\nibid. (“Melissa in the lobby popped up and said, ‘oh, my\nGod, has he shot Nora?’ ”).\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

See Brief for Petitioner 6.\n“The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, how\never, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule,\nfor most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.” Mus\ncarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138 (1998); see also\nSmith, supra, at 239 (“The mere possibility of articulating\na narrower construction, however, does not by itself make\nthe rule of lenity applicable”). “To invoke the rule, we\nmust conclude that there is a grievous ambiguity or uncer\ntainty in the statute.” Muscarello, supra, at 138–139\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the\nstatutory text and structure convince us that the dis\ncharge provision does not contain an intent requirement.\nDean’s contrary arguments are not enough to render the\nstatute grievously ambiguous.\n                       *      *    *\n  Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of\nintent. The 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun\nis discharged in the course of a violent or drug traffick-\ning crime, whether on purpose or by accident.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [April 29, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.\n   Accidents happen, but they seldom give rise to crimi\nnal liability. Indeed, if they cause no harm they seldom\ngive rise to any liability. The Court today nevertheless\nholds that petitioner is subject to a mandatory additional\nsentence—a species of criminal liability—for an accident\nthat caused no harm. For two reasons, 18 U. S. C.\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) should not be so construed. First, the\nstructure of §924(c)(1)(A) suggests that Congress intended\nto provide escalating sentences for increasingly culpable\nconduct and that the discharge provision therefore applies\nonly to intentional discharges. Second, even if the statute\ndid not affirmatively support that inference, the common\nlaw presumption that provisions imposing criminal penal\nties require proof of mens rea would lead to the same\nconclusion. Cf. United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,\n513 U. S. 64, 70 (1994). Accordingly, I would hold that the\nCourt of Appeals erred in concluding that petitioner could\nbe sentenced under §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) absent evidence that\nhe intended to discharge his gun.\n                              I\n  It is clear from the structure and history of §924(c)(1)(A)\nthat Congress intended §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to\nintentional discharges. The statute’s structure supports\n2                     DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe inference that Congress intended to impose increas\ningly harsh punishment for increasingly culpable conduct.\nThe lesser enhancements for carrying or brandishing\nprovided by clauses (i) and (ii) clearly require proof of\nintent. Clause (i) imposes a 5-year mandatory minimum\nsentence for using or carrying a firearm “during and in\nrelation to” a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense,\nor possessing a firearm “in furtherance” of such an offense.\nAs we have said before, the provision’s relational terms\nconvey that it does not reach inadvertent conduct. See\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 238 (1993) (“The\nphrase ‘in relation to’ . . . at a minimum, clarifies that the\nfirearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to\nthe drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement\ncannot be the result of accident or coincidence”). Simi\nlarly, clause (ii) mandates an enhanced penalty for bran\ndishing a firearm only upon proof that a defendant had\nthe specific intent to intimidate. See §924(c)(4). In that\ncontext, the most natural reading of clause (iii), which\nimposes the greatest mandatory penalty, is that it pro\nvides additional punishment for the more culpable act of\nintentional discharge.1\n   The legislative history also indicates that Congress\nintended to impose an enhanced penalty only for inten\ntional discharge. In Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,\n148 (1995), the Court held that “use” of a firearm for\npurposes of §924(c)(1) required some type of “active em\nployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering,\nstriking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to\nfire.”    Congress responded to Bailey by amending\n——————\n  1 Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, ante, at 4, Congress’ provision of\n\na specific intent element for brandishing and not for discharge only\nsupports the conclusion that Congress did not intend enhancements\nunder the discharge provision to require proof of specific intent; it\nsupports no inference that Congress also intended to eliminate any\ngeneral intent requirement and thereby make offenders strictly liable.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n§924(c)(1), making it an offense to “posses[s]” a firearm “in\nfurtherance of” one of the predicate offenses and adding\nsentencing enhancements for brandishing and discharge.\nSee Pub. L. 105–386, §1(2)(1), 112 Stat. 3469; see also 144\nCong. Rec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine) (refer\nring to the amendments as the “Bailey Fix Act”). Given\nthe close relationship between the Bailey decision and\nCongress’ enactment of the brandishing and discharge\nprovisions, those terms are best read as codifying some of\nthe more culpable among the “active employments” of a\nfirearm that the Court identified in Bailey.\n                             II\n   Even if there were no evidence that Congress intended\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to intentional discharges,\nthe presumption that criminal provisions include an intent\nrequirement would lead me to the same conclusion. Con\nsistent with the common-law tradition, the requirement of\nmens rea has long been the rule of our criminal jurispru\ndence. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,\n438 U. S. 422 (1978). The concept of crime as a “concur\nrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand . . .\ntook deep and early root in American soil.” Morissette v.\nUnited States, 342 U. S. 246, 251–252 (1952). Legislating\nagainst that backdrop, States often omitted intent ele\nments when codifying the criminal law, and “courts as\nsumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the\nprinciple but merely recognized that intent was so inher\nent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory\naffirmation.” Id., at 252. Similarly, absent a clear state\nment by Congress that it intended to create a strict\nliability offense, a mens rea requirement has generally\nbeen presumed in federal statutes. See id., at 273; Staples\nv. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 605–606 (1994). With only\na few narrowly delineated exceptions for such crimes as\nstatutory rape and public welfare offenses, the presump\n4                  DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntion remains the rule today. See Morissette, 342 U. S., at\n251–254, and n. 8; see also Staples, 511 U. S., at 606–607\n(discussing United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922)).\n   Although mandatory minimum sentencing provisions\nare of too recent genesis to have any common-law pedi\ngree, see Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 579, 581,\nn. 5 (2002) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), there is no sensible\nreason for treating them differently from offense elements\nfor purposes of the presumption of mens rea. Sentencing\nprovisions of this type have substantially the same effect\non a defendant’s liberty as aggravated offense provisions.\nAlthough a sentencing judge has discretion to issue sen\ntences under §924(c)(1)(A) within the substantial range\nbounded on one end by the 5-, 7-, or 10-year mandatory\nminimum sentence and on the other by the statutory\nmaximum sentence, judges in practice rarely exercise that\ndiscretion. As JUSTICE THOMAS noted in Harris, “the\nsentence imposed when a defendant is found only to have\n‘carried’ a firearm ‘in relation to’ a drug trafficking offense\nappears to be, almost uniformly, if not invariably, five\nyears,” and “those found to have brandished a firearm\ntypically, if not always, are sentenced only to 7 years in\nprison while those found to have discharged a firearm are\nsentenced only to 10 years.” Id., at 578 (dissenting opin\nion); see also United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual §2K2.4, comment., n. 2 (Nov. 2008)\n(USSG) (stating that the minimum sentence required by\n§924(c)(1)(A) is the guideline sentence and any increase is\nan upward departure). If anything, imposition of a man\ndatory minimum sentence under §924(c)(1)(A) will likely\nhave a greater effect on a defendant’s liberty than will\nconviction for another offense because, unlike sentences\nfor most federal offenses, sentences imposed pursuant to\nthat section must be served consecutively to any other\nsentence. See §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).\n   As the foregoing shows, mandatory minimum sentenc\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ning provisions are in effect no different from aggravated\noffense provisions. The common-law tradition of requiring\nproof of mens rea to establish criminal culpability should\nthus apply equally to such sentencing factors. Absent a\nclear indication that Congress intended to create a strict-\nliability enhancement, courts should presume that a pro-\nvision that mandates enhanced criminal penalties re-\nquires proof of intent. This conclusion is bolstered by the\nfact that we have long applied the rule of lenity—which is\nsimilar to the mens rea rule in both origin and purpose—to\nprovisions that increase criminal penalties as well as\nthose that criminalize conduct. See United States v.\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305 (1992) (plurality opinion);\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980); Ladner\nv. United States, 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958).2 Accordingly, I\nwould apply the presumption in this case and avoid the\nstrange result of imposing a substantially harsher penalty\nfor an act caused not by an “evil-meaning mind” but by a\nclumsy hand.\n   The majority urges the result in this case is not unusual\nbecause legislatures commonly “punish individuals for the\nunintended consequences of their unlawful acts,” ante, at\n7, but the collection of examples that follows this assertion\n——————\n  2 To be sure, there are also inquiries for which the Court has said that\nsentencing provisions are different. In Harris v. United States, 536\nU. S. 545, 557 (2002) (plurality opinion), and McMillan v. Pennsyl-\nvania, 477 U. S. 79, 87–88 (1986), the Court distinguished for purposes\nof constitutional analysis mandatory minimum sentencing schemes\nfrom offense elements and provisions that increase the statutory\nmaximum sentence. I continue to agree with JUSTICE THOMAS’ compel-\nling dissent in Harris, in which he rejected the distinction on the\nground that mandatory minimum sentencing provisions have at least\nas significant an effect on a defendant’s liberty as additional convic-\ntions or statutory maximum provisions. 536 U. S., at 577–578. The\nlogic of treating these provisions similarly is buttressed by our subse-\nquent decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 233–234\n(2005).\n6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nis telling. The Court cites the felony-murder rule, 18\nU. S. C. §1111, and Sentencing Guidelines provisions that\npermit increased punishment based on the seriousness of\nthe harm caused by the predicate act, see USSG\n§2A2.2(b)(3) (increasing the offense level for aggravated\nassault according to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3\n(increasing the offense level for operating a common car\nrier under the influence of alcohol or drugs if death or\nserious injury results). These examples have in common\nthe provision of enhanced penalties for the infliction of\nsome additional harm.         By contrast, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\npunishes discharges whether or not any harm is realized.\nAdditionally, in each of the majority’s examples Congress\nor the Sentencing Commission made explicit its intent to\npunish the resulting harm regardless of the perpetrator’s\nmens rea. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no analogous\nstatement. For these reasons, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) is readily\ndistinguishable from the provisions the majority cites.\n   Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, the existence of\nprovisions that penalize the unintended consequences of\nfelonious conduct underscores the reasonableness of read\ning §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to require proof of intent. When harm\nresults from a firearm discharge during the commission of\na violent felony or drug trafficking offense, the defendant\nwill be punishable pursuant to USSG §2B3.1(b)(3) (in\ncreasing the offense level for robbery according to the\nresulting degree of bodily injury), the felony-murder rule,\nor a similar provision. That a defendant will be subject to\npunishment for the harm resulting from a discharge\nwhether or not he is also subject to the enhanced penalty\nimposed by §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) indicates that the latter\nprovision was intended to serve a different purpose—\nnamely, to punish the more culpable act of intentional\ndischarge.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   In sum, the structure and history of §924(c)(1)(A) indi\ncate that Congress meant to impose the more substantial\npenalty provided by clause (iii) only in cases of intentional\ndischarge. Were the statute unclear in that regard, I\nwould reach the same conclusion by applying the pre\nsumption that Congress intended to include a mens rea\nrequirement. Mandatory sentencing provisions are not\nmeaningfully distinguishable from statutes defining\ncrimes to which we have previously applied the presump\ntion; the rule of Morissette and Staples and not the felony\nmurder rule should therefore guide our analysis. Because\nthere is insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption in\nthis case, I respectfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [April 29, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting.\n   For many of the reasons that JUSTICE STEVENS sets\nforth, I believe the statutory provision before us applies to\nintentional, but not to accidental, discharges of firearms.\nAs JUSTICE STEVENS points out, this Court in Bailey v.\nUnited States, 516 U. S. 137, 148 (1995), held that simple\npossession of a firearm, without some type of “active em\nployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering,\nstriking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to\nfire,” did not constitute “use” of a firearm. See ante, at 2\n(dissenting opinion). It seems possible, if not likely, that\nCongress, in this statute, amended then-existing law by\ncriminalizing the “simple possession” that Bailey found\ninsufficient and then imposed a set of ever more severe\nmandatory sentences for the conduct that the Court listed\nin Bailey when it considered ways in which an offender\nmight use a firearm. See ante, at 2–3. If so, the statutory\nwords “is discharged,” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii), refer to\nwhat Bailey called “firing,” and they do not encompass an\naccidental discharge.\n   I concede that the Court lists strong arguments to the\ncontrary. But, in my view, the “rule of lenity” tips the\nbalance against the majority’s position. The “rule of len\nity” as ordinarily applied reflects the law’s insistence that\na criminal statute provide “fair warning . . . of what the\n2                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlaw intends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States\nv. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But here, where a mandatory minimum\nsentence is at issue, its application reflects an additional\nconsideration, namely, that its application will likely\nproduce an interpretation that hews more closely to Con\ngress’ sentencing intent.\n   That is because, in the case of a mandatory minimum,\nan interpretation that errs on the side of exclusion (an\ninterpretive error on the side of leniency) still permits the\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, perhaps\nclose to, the statutory sentence even if that sentence (be\ncause of the court’s interpretation of the statute) is not\nlegislatively required. See, e.g., United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2B3.1(b)(2) (Nov. 2008)\n(Specific Offense Characteristics) (possibly calling for a 7\nto-9 year increase in the sentencing range in a case like\nthis one). The sentencing judge is most likely to give a low\nnon-Guidelines sentence in an unusual case—where the\nnature of the accident, for example, makes clear that the\noffender was not responsible and perhaps that the dis\ncharge put no one at risk. See, e.g., Koon v. United States,\n518 U. S. 81, 92–94 (1996). And, of course, the unusual\nnature of such a case means it is the kind of case that\nCongress did not have in mind when it enacted the stat\nute. Moreover, an error that excludes (erroneously) a set\nof instances Congress meant to include (such as accidental\ndischarge) could lead the Sentencing Commission to focus\non those cases and exercise its investigative and judg\nmental powers to decide how those cases should be han\ndled. This investigation would, in turn, make available to\nCongress a body of evidence and analysis that will help it\nreconsider the statute if it wishes to do so.\n   On the other hand, an interpretation that errs on the\nside of inclusion requires imposing 10 years of additional\nimprisonment on individuals whom Congress would not\n                Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave intended to punish so harshly. Such an interpreta\ntion would prevent a sentencing court from giving a lower\nsentence even in an unusual case, for example, where the\naccident is unintended, unforeseeable, and imposes no\nadditional risk. And such an interpretation, by errone\nously taking discretion away from the sentencing judge,\nwould ensure results that depart dramatically from those\nCongress would have intended. Cf. Harris v. United\nStates, 536 U. S. 545, 570 (2002) (BREYER, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment) (“statutory manda\ntory minimums generally deny the judge the legal power\nto depart downward, no matter how unusual the special\ncircumstances that call for leniency”). Moreover, because\nsuch unusual cases are (by definition) rare, these errors\nwould provide little incentive to the Sentencing Commis\nsion or Congress to reconsider the statute.\n   These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of lenity\nspecial force in the context of mandatory minimum provi\nsions. Because I believe the discharge provision here is\nsufficiently ambiguous to warrant the application of that\nrule, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145881, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/04/29/Dean_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 4, 2009—Decided April 29, 2009\nAn individual convicted for using or carrying a firearm during and in\n relation to any violent or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a fire\n arm in furtherance of such a crime, receives a 5-year mandatory\n minimum sentence, in addition to the punishment for the underlying\n crime. 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum in\n creases to 7 years “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if\n the firearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).\n    Petitioner Dean was convicted of conspiring to commit a bank rob\n bery and discharging a firearm during an armed robbery. Because\n the firearm was “discharged” during the robbery, Dean was sen\n tenced to a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term on the firearm\n count. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). On appeal, he contended that the discharge\n was accidental, and that §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the de\n fendant intended to discharge the firearm. The Eleventh Circuit af\n firmed, holding that no proof of intent is required.\nHeld: Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of intent. The\n 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the\n course of a violent or drug trafficking crime, whether on purpose or\n by accident. Pp. 2–9.\n    (a) Subsection (iii) provides a minimum 10-year sentence “if the\n firearm is discharged.” It does not require that the discharge be done\n knowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of limitation.\n This Court “ordinarily resist[s] reading words or elements into a\n statute that do not appear on its face.” Bates v. United States, 522\n U. S. 23, 29. Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates\n that subsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. Cf. Watson v.\n United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___. The statute’s structure also sug\n gests no such limitation. Congress expressly included an intent re\n2                       DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    quirement for the 7-year mandatory minimum for brandishing a fire\n    arm by separately defining “brandish” to require that the firearm be\n    displayed “in order to intimidate” another person. §924(c)(4). Con\n    gress did not, however, separately define “discharge” to include an in\n    tent requirement. It is generally presumed that Congress acts inten\n    tionally when including particular language in one section of a\n    statute but not in another. Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,\n    23. Contrary to Dean’s contention, the phrase “during and in relation\n    to” in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A) does not modify “is dis\n    charged,” which appears in a separate subsection and in a different\n    voice than the principal paragraph. “[I]n relation to” is most natu\n    rally read to modify only the nearby verbs “uses” and “carries.” This\n    reading will not lead to the absurd results posited by Dean. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) Dean argues that subsection (iii) must be limited to intentional\n    discharges in order to give effect to the statute’s progression of\n    harsher penalties for increasingly culpable conduct. While it is un\n    usual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely\n    accidental conduct, it is not unusual to punish individuals for the un\n    intended consequences of their unlawful acts. The fact that the dis\n    charge may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blame\n    less. The sentencing enhancement accounts for the risk of harm\n    resulting from the manner in which the crime is carried out, for\n    which the defendant is responsible. See Harris v. United States, 536\n    U. S. 545, 553. An individual bringing a loaded weapon to commit a\n    crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally. A gun\n    shot—whether accidental or intended—increases the risk that others\n    will be injured, that people will panic, or that violence will be used in\n    response. It also traumatizes bystanders, as it did here. Pp. 6–9.\n       (c) Because the statutory text and structure demonstrate that the\n    discharge provision does not contain an intent requirement, the rule\n    of lenity is not implicated in this case.\n517 F. 3d 1224, affirmed.\n\n   ROBERTS, C.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 29, 2009] \n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  Accidents happen. Sometimes they happen to individu\nals committing crimes with loaded guns. The question\nhere is whether extra punishment Congress imposed for\nthe discharge of a gun during certain crimes applies when\nthe gun goes off accidentally.\n                              I\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or\ncarrying a firearm during and in relation to any violent or\ndrug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in further\nance of such a crime. An individual convicted of that\noffense receives a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, in\naddition to the punishment for the underlying crime.\n§924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum increases to 7\nyears “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if the\nfirearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).\n   In this case, a masked man entered a bank, waved a\ngun, and yelled at everyone to get down. He then walked\nbehind the teller counter and started removing money\nfrom the teller stations. He grabbed bills with his left\n2                   DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nhand, holding the gun in his right. At one point, he\nreached over a teller to remove money from her drawer.\nAs he was collecting the money, the gun discharged, leav\ning a bullet hole in the partition between two stations.\nThe robber cursed and dashed out of the bank. Witnesses\nlater testified that he seemed surprised that the gun had\ngone off. No one was hurt. App. 16–19, 24, 27, 47–48, 79.\n   Police arrested Christopher Michael Dean and Ricardo\nCurtis Lopez for the crime. Both defendants were charged\nwith conspiracy to commit a robbery affecting interstate\ncommerce, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1951(a), and aiding\nand abetting each other in using, carrying, possessing, and\ndischarging a firearm during an armed robbery, in viola\ntion of §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and §2. App. 11–12. At trial,\nDean admitted that he had committed the robbery, id., at\n76–81, and a jury found him guilty on both the robbery\nand firearm counts. The District Court sentenced Dean to\na mandatory minimum term of 10 years in prison on the\nfirearm count, because the firearm “discharged” during\nthe robbery. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii); App. 136.\n   Dean appealed, contending that the discharge was\naccidental, and that the sentencing enhancement in\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the defendant in\ntended to discharge the firearm. The Court of Appeals\naffirmed, holding that separate proof of intent was not\nrequired. 517 F. 3d 1224, 1229 (CA11 2008). That deci\nsion created a conflict among the Circuits over whether\nthe accidental discharge of a firearm during the specified\ncrimes gives rise to the 10-year mandatory minimum. See\nUnited States v. Brown, 449 F. 3d 154 (CADC 2006) (hold\ning that it does not). We granted certiorari to resolve that\nconflict. 555 U. S. ____ (2008).\n                               II\n    Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides:\n      “[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or\n    carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such\n    crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the\n    punishment provided for such crime of violence or\n    drug trafficking crime—\n      “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n    less than 5 years;\n      “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n      “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”\n   The principal paragraph defines a complete offense and\nthe subsections “explain how defendants are to ‘be sen\ntenced.’ ” Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552\n(2002). Subsection (i) “sets a catchall minimum” sentence\nof not less than five years. Id., at 552–553. Subsections\n(ii) and (iii) increase the minimum penalty if the firearm\n“is brandished” or “is discharged.” See id., at 553. The\nparties disagree over whether §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains a\nrequirement that the defendant intend to discharge the\nfirearm. We hold that it does not.\n                               A\n  “We start, as always, with the language of the statute.”\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000). The text of\nsubsection (iii) provides that a defendant shall be sen\ntenced to a minimum of 10 years “if the firearm is dis\ncharged.” It does not require that the discharge be done\nknowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of\nlimitation. As we explained in Bates v. United States, 522\nU. S. 23 (1997), in declining to infer an “ ‘intent to de\nfraud’ ” requirement into a statute, “we ordinarily resist\nreading words or elements into a statute that do not ap\npear on its face.” Id., at 29.\n  Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates that\nsubsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. The pas\n4                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsive voice focuses on an event that occurs without respect\nto a specific actor, and therefore without respect to any\nactor’s intent or culpability. Cf. Watson v. United States,\n552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7) (use of passive\nvoice in statutory phrase “to be used” in 18 U. S. C.\n§924(d)(1) reflects “agnosticism . . . about who does the\nusing”). It is whether something happened—not how or\nwhy it happened—that matters.\n   The structure of the statute also suggests that subsec\ntion (iii) is not limited to the intentional discharge of a\nfirearm. Subsection (ii) provides a 7-year mandatory\nminimum sentence if the firearm “is brandished.” Con\ngress expressly included an intent requirement for that\nprovision, by defining “brandish” to mean “to display all or\npart of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the\nfirearm known to another person, in order to intimidate\nthat person.” §924(c)(4) (emphasis added). The defendant\nmust have intended to brandish the firearm, because the\nbrandishing must have been done for a specific purpose.\nCongress did not, however, separately define “discharge”\nto include an intent requirement. “[W]here Congress\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russello v. United\nStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Dean argues that the statute is not silent on the ques\ntion presented. Congress, he contends, included an intent\nelement in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A), and\nthat element extends to the sentencing enhancements.\nSection 924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or carrying a fire\narm “during and in relation to” any violent or drug traf\nficking crime. In Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223\n(1993), we stated that the phrase “in relation to” means\n“that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrespect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or in\nvolvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.”\nId., at 238. Dean argues that the adverbial phrase thus\nnecessarily embodies an intent requirement, and that the\nphrase modifies all the verbs in the statute—not only use,\ncarry, and possess, but also brandish and discharge. Such\na reading requires that a perpetrator knowingly discharge\nthe firearm for the enhancement to apply. If the discharge\nis accidental, Dean argues, it is not “in relation to” the\nunderlying crime.\n   The most natural reading of the statute, however, is\nthat “in relation to” modifies only the nearby verbs “uses”\nand “carries.” The next verb—“possesses”—is modified by\nits own adverbial clause, “in furtherance of.” The last two\nverbs—“is brandished” and “is discharged”—appear in\nseparate subsections and are in a different voice than the\nverbs in the principal paragraph. There is no basis for\nreading “in relation to” to extend all the way down to\nmodify “is discharged.” The better reading of the statute\nis that the adverbial phrases in the opening paragraph—\n“in relation to” and “in furtherance of”—modify their\nrespective nearby verbs, and that neither phrase extends\nto the sentencing factors.\n   But, Dean argues, such a reading will lead to absurd\nresults. The discharge provision on its face contains no\ntemporal or causal limitations. In the absence of an intent\nrequirement, the enhancement would apply “regardless of\nwhen the actions occur, or by whom or for what reason\nthey are taken.” Brief for Petitioner 11–12. It would, for\nexample, apply if the gun used during the crime were\ndischarged “weeks (or years) before or after the crime.”\nReply Brief for Petitioner 11.\n   We do not agree that implying an intent requirement is\nnecessary to address such concerns. As the Government\nrecognizes, sentencing factors such as the one here “often\ninvolve . . . special features of the manner in which a basic\n6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncrime was carried out.” Brief for United States 29 (quot\ning Harris, 536 U. S., at 553; internal quotation marks\nomitted). The basic crime here is using or carrying a\nfirearm during and in relation to a violent or drug traffick\ning crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of any\nsuch crime. Fanciful hypotheticals testing whether the\ndischarge was a “special featur[e]” of how the “basic crime\nwas carried out,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 553 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted), are best addressed in those terms,\nnot by contorting and stretching the statutory language to\nimply an intent requirement.\n                              B\n   Dean further argues that even if the statute is viewed as\nsilent on the intent question, that silence compels a ruling\nin his favor. There is, he notes, a presumption that crimi\nnal prohibitions include a requirement that the Govern\nment prove the defendant intended the conduct made\ncriminal. In light of this presumption, we have “on a\nnumber of occasions read a state-of-mind component into\nan offense even when the statutory definition did not in\nterms so provide.” United States v. United States Gypsum\nCo., 438 U. S. 422, 437 (1978). “[S]ome indication of con\ngressional intent, express or implied, is required to dis\npense with mens rea as an element of a crime.” Staples v.\nUnited States, 511 U. S. 600, 606 (1994).\n   Dean argues that the presumption is especially strong\nin this case, given the structure and purpose of the stat\nute. In his view, the three subsections are intended to\nprovide harsher penalties for increasingly culpable con\nduct: a 5-year minimum for using, carrying, or possessing\na firearm; a 7-year minimum for brandishing a firearm;\nand a 10-year minimum for discharging a firearm. Incor\nporating an intent requirement into the discharge provi\nsion is necessary to give effect to that progression, because\nan accidental discharge is less culpable than intentional\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbrandishment. See Brown, 449 F. 3d, at 156.\n   It is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the\nconsequences of purely accidental conduct. But it is not\nunusual to punish individuals for the unintended conse\nquences of their unlawful acts. See 2 W. LaFave, Sub\nstantive Criminal Law §14.4, pp. 436–437 (2d ed. 2003).\nThe felony-murder rule is a familiar example: If a defen\ndant commits an unintended homicide while committing\nanother felony, the defendant can be convicted of murder.\nSee 18 U. S. C. §1111. The Sentencing Guidelines reflect\nthe same principle. See United States Sentencing Com\nmission, Guidelines Manual §2A2.2(b)(3) (Nov. 2008)\n(USSG) (increasing offense level for aggravated assault\naccording to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3 (in\ncreasing offense level for operating or directing the opera\ntion of a common carrier under the influence of alcohol or\ndrugs if death or serious bodily injury results).\n   Blackstone expressed the idea in the following terms:\n    “[I]f any accidental mischief happens to follow from\n    the performance of a lawful act, the party stands ex\n    cused from all guilt: but if a man be doing any thing\n    unlawful, and a consequence ensues which he did not\n    foresee or intend, as the death of a man or the like, his\n    want of foresight shall be no excuse; for, being guilty\n    of one offence, in doing antecedently what is in itself\n    unlawful, he is criminally guilty of whatever conse\n    quence may follow the first misbehaviour.” 4 W.\n    Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n    26–27 (1769).\nHere the defendant is already guilty of unlawful conduct\ntwice over: a violent or drug trafficking offense and the\nuse, carrying, or possession of a firearm in the course of\nthat offense. That unlawful conduct was not an accident.\nSee Smith, 508 U. S., at 238.\n  The fact that the actual discharge of a gun covered\n8                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) may be accidental does not mean\nthat the defendant is blameless. The sentencing en\nhancement in subsection (iii) accounts for the risk of harm\nresulting from the manner in which the crime is carried\nout, for which the defendant is responsible. See Harris,\nsupra, at 553. An individual who brings a loaded weapon\nto commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will dis\ncharge accidentally. A gunshot in such circumstances—\nwhether accidental or intended—increases the risk that\nothers will be injured, that people will panic, or that vio\nlence (with its own danger to those nearby) will be used in\nresponse. Those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for\nan inadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm,\nhandle it with care during the underlying violent or drug\ntrafficking crime, leave the gun at home, or—best yet—\navoid committing the felony in the first place.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS contends that the statute should be\nread to require a showing of intent because harm resulting\nfrom a discharge may be punishable under other provi\nsions, such as the Sentencing Guidelines (but only if “bod\nily injury” results). Post, at 6 (dissenting opinion) (citing\nUSSG §2B3.1(b)(3)). But Congress in §924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\nelected to impose a mandatory term, without regard to\nmore generally applicable sentencing provisions. Punish\nment available under such provisions therefore does not\nsuggest that the statute at issue here is limited to inten\ntional discharges.\n   And although the point is not relevant under the correct\nreading of the statute, it is wrong to assert that the gun\nshot here “caused no harm.” Post, at 1. By pure luck, no\none was killed or wounded. But the gunshot plainly added\nto the trauma experienced by those held during the armed\nrobbery. See, e.g., App. 22 (the gunshot “shook us all”);\nibid. (“Melissa in the lobby popped up and said, ‘oh, my\nGod, has he shot Nora?’ ”).\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

See Brief for Petitioner 6.\n“The simple existence of some statutory ambiguity, how\never, is not sufficient to warrant application of that rule,\nfor most statutes are ambiguous to some degree.” Mus\ncarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138 (1998); see also\nSmith, supra, at 239 (“The mere possibility of articulating\na narrower construction, however, does not by itself make\nthe rule of lenity applicable”). “To invoke the rule, we\nmust conclude that there is a grievous ambiguity or uncer\ntainty in the statute.” Muscarello, supra, at 138–139\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the\nstatutory text and structure convince us that the dis\ncharge provision does not contain an intent requirement.\nDean’s contrary arguments are not enough to render the\nstatute grievously ambiguous.\n                       *      *    *\n  Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of\nintent. The 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun\nis discharged in the course of a violent or drug traffick-\ning crime, whether on purpose or by accident. The judg\nment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is\naffirmed.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [April 29, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.\n   Accidents happen, but they seldom give rise to crimi\nnal liability. Indeed, if they cause no harm they seldom\ngive rise to any liability. The Court today nevertheless\nholds that petitioner is subject to a mandatory additional\nsentence—a species of criminal liability—for an accident\nthat caused no harm. For two reasons, 18 U. S. C.\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) should not be so construed. First, the\nstructure of §924(c)(1)(A) suggests that Congress intended\nto provide escalating sentences for increasingly culpable\nconduct and that the discharge provision therefore applies\nonly to intentional discharges. Second, even if the statute\ndid not affirmatively support that inference, the common\nlaw presumption that provisions imposing criminal penal\nties require proof of mens rea would lead to the same\nconclusion. Cf. United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,\n513 U. S. 64, 70 (1994). Accordingly, I would hold that the\nCourt of Appeals erred in concluding that petitioner could\nbe sentenced under §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) absent evidence that\nhe intended to discharge his gun.\n                              I\n  It is clear from the structure and history of §924(c)(1)(A)\nthat Congress intended §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to\nintentional discharges. The statute’s structure supports\n2                     DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe inference that Congress intended to impose increas\ningly harsh punishment for increasingly culpable conduct.\nThe lesser enhancements for carrying or brandishing\nprovided by clauses (i) and (ii) clearly require proof of\nintent. Clause (i) imposes a 5-year mandatory minimum\nsentence for using or carrying a firearm “during and in\nrelation to” a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense,\nor possessing a firearm “in furtherance” of such an offense.\nAs we have said before, the provision’s relational terms\nconvey that it does not reach inadvertent conduct. See\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 238 (1993) (“The\nphrase ‘in relation to’ . . . at a minimum, clarifies that the\nfirearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to\nthe drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement\ncannot be the result of accident or coincidence”). Simi\nlarly, clause (ii) mandates an enhanced penalty for bran\ndishing a firearm only upon proof that a defendant had\nthe specific intent to intimidate. See §924(c)(4). In that\ncontext, the most natural reading of clause (iii), which\nimposes the greatest mandatory penalty, is that it pro\nvides additional punishment for the more culpable act of\nintentional discharge.1\n   The legislative history also indicates that Congress\nintended to impose an enhanced penalty only for inten\ntional discharge. In Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,\n148 (1995), the Court held that “use” of a firearm for\npurposes of §924(c)(1) required some type of “active em\nployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering,\nstriking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to\nfire.”    Congress responded to Bailey by amending\n——————\n  1 Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, ante, at 4, Congress’ provision of\n\na specific intent element for brandishing and not for discharge only\nsupports the conclusion that Congress did not intend enhancements\nunder the discharge provision to require proof of specific intent; it\nsupports no inference that Congress also intended to eliminate any\ngeneral intent requirement and thereby make offenders strictly liable.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n§924(c)(1), making it an offense to “posses[s]” a firearm “in\nfurtherance of” one of the predicate offenses and adding\nsentencing enhancements for brandishing and discharge.\nSee Pub. L. 105–386, §1(2)(1), 112 Stat. 3469; see also 144\nCong. Rec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine) (refer\nring to the amendments as the “Bailey Fix Act”). Given\nthe close relationship between the Bailey decision and\nCongress’ enactment of the brandishing and discharge\nprovisions, those terms are best read as codifying some of\nthe more culpable among the “active employments” of a\nfirearm that the Court identified in Bailey.\n                             II\n   Even if there were no evidence that Congress intended\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to intentional discharges,\nthe presumption that criminal provisions include an intent\nrequirement would lead me to the same conclusion. Con\nsistent with the common-law tradition, the requirement of\nmens rea has long been the rule of our criminal jurispru\ndence. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,\n438 U. S. 422 (1978). The concept of crime as a “concur\nrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand . . .\ntook deep and early root in American soil.” Morissette v.\nUnited States, 342 U. S. 246, 251–252 (1952). Legislating\nagainst that backdrop, States often omitted intent ele\nments when codifying the criminal law, and “courts as\nsumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the\nprinciple but merely recognized that intent was so inher\nent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory\naffirmation.” Id., at 252. Similarly, absent a clear state\nment by Congress that it intended to create a strict\nliability offense, a mens rea requirement has generally\nbeen presumed in federal statutes. See id., at 273; Staples\nv. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 605–606 (1994). With only\na few narrowly delineated exceptions for such crimes as\nstatutory rape and public welfare offenses, the presump\n4                  DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntion remains the rule today. See Morissette, 342 U. S., at\n251–254, and n. 8; see also Staples, 511 U. S., at 606–607\n(discussing United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922)).\n   Although mandatory minimum sentencing provisions\nare of too recent genesis to have any common-law pedi\ngree, see Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 579, 581,\nn. 5 (2002) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), there is no sensible\nreason for treating them differently from offense elements\nfor purposes of the presumption of mens rea. Sentencing\nprovisions of this type have substantially the same effect\non a defendant’s liberty as aggravated offense provisions.\nAlthough a sentencing judge has discretion to issue sen\ntences under §924(c)(1)(A) within the substantial range\nbounded on one end by the 5-, 7-, or 10-year mandatory\nminimum sentence and on the other by the statutory\nmaximum sentence, judges in practice rarely exercise that\ndiscretion. As JUSTICE THOMAS noted in Harris, “the\nsentence imposed when a defendant is found only to have\n‘carried’ a firearm ‘in relation to’ a drug trafficking offense\nappears to be, almost uniformly, if not invariably, five\nyears,” and “those found to have brandished a firearm\ntypically, if not always, are sentenced only to 7 years in\nprison while those found to have discharged a firearm are\nsentenced only to 10 years.” Id., at 578 (dissenting opin\nion); see also United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual §2K2.4, comment., n. 2 (Nov. 2008)\n(USSG) (stating that the minimum sentence required by\n§924(c)(1)(A) is the guideline sentence and any increase is\nan upward departure). If anything, imposition of a man\ndatory minimum sentence under §924(c)(1)(A) will likely\nhave a greater effect on a defendant’s liberty than will\nconviction for another offense because, unlike sentences\nfor most federal offenses, sentences imposed pursuant to\nthat section must be served consecutively to any other\nsentence. See §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).\n   As the foregoing shows, mandatory minimum sentenc\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

The common-law tradition of requiring\nproof of mens rea to establish criminal culpability should\nthus apply equally to such sentencing factors. Absent a\nclear indication that Congress intended to create a strict-\nliability enhancement, courts should presume that a pro-\nvision that mandates enhanced criminal penalties re-\nquires proof of intent. This conclusion is bolstered by the\nfact that we have long applied the rule of lenity—which is\nsimilar to the mens rea rule in both origin and purpose—to\nprovisions that increase criminal penalties as well as\nthose that criminalize conduct. See United States v.\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305 (1992) (plurality opinion);\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980); Ladner\nv. United States, 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958).2 Accordingly, I\nwould apply the presumption in this case and avoid the\nstrange result of imposing a substantially harsher penalty\nfor an act caused not by an “evil-meaning mind” but by a\nclumsy hand.\n   The majority urges the result in this case is not unusual\nbecause legislatures commonly “punish individuals for the\nunintended consequences of their unlawful acts,” ante, at\n7, but the collection of examples that follows this assertion\n——————\n  2 To be sure, there are also inquiries for which the Court has said that\nsentencing provisions are different. In Harris v. United States, 536\nU. S. 545, 557 (2002) (plurality opinion), and McMillan v. Pennsyl-\nvania, 477 U. S. 79, 87–88 (1986), the Court distinguished for purposes\nof constitutional analysis mandatory minimum sentencing schemes\nfrom offense elements and provisions that increase the statutory\nmaximum sentence. I continue to agree with JUSTICE THOMAS’ compel-\nling dissent in Harris, in which he rejected the distinction on the\nground that mandatory minimum sentencing provisions have at least\nas significant an effect on a defendant’s liberty as additional convic-\ntions or statutory maximum provisions. 536 U. S., at 577–578. The\nlogic of treating these provisions similarly is buttressed by our subse-\nquent decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 233–234\n(2005).\n6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nis telling. The Court cites the felony-murder rule, 18\nU. S. C. §1111, and Sentencing Guidelines provisions that\npermit increased punishment based on the seriousness of\nthe harm caused by the predicate act, see USSG\n§2A2.2(b)(3) (increasing the offense level for aggravated\nassault according to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3\n(increasing the offense level for operating a common car\nrier under the influence of alcohol or drugs if death or\nserious injury results). These examples have in common\nthe provision of enhanced penalties for the infliction of\nsome additional harm.         By contrast, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\npunishes discharges whether or not any harm is realized.\nAdditionally, in each of the majority’s examples Congress\nor the Sentencing Commission made explicit its intent to\npunish the resulting harm regardless of the perpetrator’s\nmens rea. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no analogous\nstatement. For these reasons, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) is readily\ndistinguishable from the provisions the majority cites.\n   Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, the existence of\nprovisions that penalize the unintended consequences of\nfelonious conduct underscores the reasonableness of read\ning §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to require proof of intent. When harm\nresults from a firearm discharge during the commission of\na violent felony or drug trafficking offense, the defendant\nwill be punishable pursuant to USSG §2B3.1(b)(3) (in\ncreasing the offense level for robbery according to the\nresulting degree of bodily injury), the felony-murder rule,\nor a similar provision. That a defendant will be subject to\npunishment for the harm resulting from a discharge\nwhether or not he is also subject to the enhanced penalty\nimposed by §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) indicates that the latter\nprovision was intended to serve a different purpose—\nnamely, to punish the more culpable act of intentional\ndischarge.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Were the statute unclear in that regard, I\nwould reach the same conclusion by applying the pre\nsumption that Congress intended to include a mens rea\nrequirement. Mandatory sentencing provisions are not\nmeaningfully distinguishable from statutes defining\ncrimes to which we have previously applied the presump\ntion; the rule of Morissette and Staples and not the felony\nmurder rule should therefore guide our analysis. Because\nthere is insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption in\nthis case, I respectfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

S. 137, 148 (1995), held that simple\npossession of a firearm, without some type of “active em\nployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering,\nstriking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to\nfire,” did not constitute “use” of a firearm. See ante, at 2\n(dissenting opinion). It seems possible, if not likely, that\nCongress, in this statute, amended then-existing law by\ncriminalizing the “simple possession” that Bailey found\ninsufficient and then imposed a set of ever more severe\nmandatory sentences for the conduct that the Court listed\nin Bailey when it considered ways in which an offender\nmight use a firearm. See ante, at 2–3. If so, the statutory\nwords “is discharged,” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii), refer to\nwhat Bailey called “firing,” and they do not encompass an\naccidental discharge.\n   I concede that the Court lists strong arguments to the\ncontrary. But, in my view, the “rule of lenity” tips the\nbalance against the majority’s position. The “rule of len\nity” as ordinarily applied reflects the law’s insistence that\na criminal statute provide “fair warning . . . of what the\n2                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlaw intends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States\nv. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But here, where a mandatory minimum\nsentence is at issue, its application reflects an additional\nconsideration, namely, that its application will likely\nproduce an interpretation that hews more closely to Con\ngress’ sentencing intent.\n   That is because, in the case of a mandatory minimum,\nan interpretation that errs on the side of exclusion (an\ninterpretive error on the side of leniency) still permits the\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, perhaps\nclose to, the statutory sentence even if that sentence (be\ncause of the court’s interpretation of the statute) is not\nlegislatively required. See, e.g., United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2B3.1(b)(2) (Nov. 2008)\n(Specific Offense Characteristics) (possibly calling for a 7\nto-9 year increase in the sentencing range in a case like\nthis one). The sentencing judge is most likely to give a low\nnon-Guidelines sentence in an unusual case—where the\nnature of the accident, for example, makes clear that the\noffender was not responsible and perhaps that the dis\ncharge put no one at risk. See, e.g., Koon v. United States,\n518 U. S. 81, 92–94 (1996). And, of course, the unusual\nnature of such a case means it is the kind of case that\nCongress did not have in mind when it enacted the stat\nute. Moreover, an error that excludes (erroneously) a set\nof instances Congress meant to include (such as accidental\ndischarge) could lead the Sentencing Commission to focus\non those cases and exercise its investigative and judg\nmental powers to decide how those cases should be han\ndled. This investigation would, in turn, make available to\nCongress a body of evidence and analysis that will help it\nreconsider the statute if it wishes to do so.\n   On the other hand, an interpretation that errs on the\nside of inclusion requires imposing 10 years of additional\nimprisonment on individuals whom Congress would not\n                Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave intended to punish so harshly. Such an interpreta\ntion would prevent a sentencing court from giving a lower\nsentence even in an unusual case, for example, where the\naccident is unintended, unforeseeable, and imposes no\nadditional risk. And such an interpretation, by errone\nously taking discretion away from the sentencing judge,\nwould ensure results that depart dramatically from those\nCongress would have intended. Cf. Harris v. United\nStates, 536 U. S. 545, 570 (2002) (BREYER, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment) (“statutory manda\ntory minimums generally deny the judge the legal power\nto depart downward, no matter how unusual the special\ncircumstances that call for leniency”). Moreover, because\nsuch unusual cases are (by definition) rare, these errors\nwould provide little incentive to the Sentencing Commis\nsion or Congress to reconsider the statute.\n   These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of lenity\nspecial force in the context of mandatory minimum provi\nsions. Because I believe the discharge provision here is\nsufficiently ambiguous to warrant the application of that\nrule, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145881/", "sha1": "87e088fb3c2dd7e58069df6fdee58c7e04cd8956", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-050", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:08:53"}
