Argued November 4, 2008\u2014Decided April 28, 2009\nFederal law bans the broadcasting of \u201cany . . . indecent . . . language,\u201d\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, which includes references to sexual or excretory ac\n  tivity or organs, see FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726. Hav\n  ing first defined the prohibited speech in 1975, the Federal Commu\n  nications Commission (FCC) took a cautious, but gradually\n  expanding, approach to enforcing the statutory prohibition. In 2004,\n  the FCC\u2019s Golden Globes Order declared for the first time that an ex\n  pletive (nonliteral) use of the F-Word or the S-Word could be actiona\n  bly indecent, even when the word is used only once.\n     This case concerns isolated utterances of the F- and S-Words dur\n  ing two live broadcasts aired by Fox Television Stations, Inc. In its\n  order upholding the indecency findings, the FCC, inter alia, stated\n  that the Golden Globes Order eliminated any doubt that fleeting ex\n  pletives could be actionable; declared that under the new policy, a\n  lack of repetition weighs against a finding of indecency, but is not a\n  safe harbor; and held that both broadcasts met the new test because\n  one involved a literal description of excrement and both invoked the\n  F-Word. The order did not impose sanctions for either broadcast.\n  The Second Circuit set aside the agency action, declining to address\n  the constitutionality of the FCC\u2019s action but finding the FCC\u2019s rea\n  soning inadequate under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n489 F. 3d 444, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\n  III\u2013E, concluding:\n    1. The FCC\u2019s orders are neither \u201carbitrary\u201d nor \u201ccapricious\u201d within\n2              FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the meaning of the APA, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). Pp. 9\u201319.\n         (a) Under the APA standard, an agency must \u201cexamine the rele\n    vant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.\u201d\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut.\n    Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 43. In overturning the FCC\u2019s\n    judgment, the Second Circuit relied in part on its precedent inter\n    preting the APA and State Farm to require a more substantial expla\n    nation for agency action that changes prior policy. There is, however,\n    no basis in the Act or this Court\u2019s opinions for a requirement that all\n    agency change be subjected to more searching review. Although an\n    agency must ordinarily display awareness that it is changing posi\n    tion, see United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 696, and may some\n    times need to account for prior factfinding or certain reliance inter\n    ests created by a prior policy, it need not demonstrate to a court\u2019s\n    satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the\n    reasons for the old one. It suffices that the new policy is permissible\n    under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the\n    agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change adequately\n    indicates. Pp. 9\u201312.\n         (b) Under these standards, the FCC\u2019s new policy and its order\n    finding the broadcasts at issue actionably indecent were neither arbi\n    trary nor capricious. First, the FCC forthrightly acknowledged that\n    its recent actions have broken new ground, taking account of incon\n    sistent prior FCC and staff actions, and explicitly disavowing them as\n    no longer good law. The agency\u2019s reasons for expanding its enforce\n    ment activity, moreover, were entirely rational. Even when used as\n    an expletive, the F-Word\u2019s power to insult and offend derives from its\n    sexual meaning. And the decision to look at the patent offensiveness\n    of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with Pacifica\u2019s\n    context-based approach. Because the FCC\u2019s prior safe-harbor-for\n    single-words approach would likely lead to more widespread use, and\n    in light of technological advances reducing the costs of bleeping of\n    fending words, it was rational for the agency to step away from its old\n    regime. The FCC\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions precludes any\n    argument that it is arbitrarily punishing parties without notice of\n    their actions\u2019 potential consequences. Pp. 13\u201315.\n         (c) None of the Second Circuit\u2019s grounds for finding the FCC\u2019s ac\n    tion arbitrary and capricious is valid. First, the FCC did not need\n    empirical evidence proving that fleeting expletives constitute harmful\n    \u201cfirst blows\u201d to children; it suffices to know that children mimic be\n    havior they observe. Second, the court of appeals\u2019 finding that fidel\n    ity to the FCC\u2019s \u201cfirst blow\u201d theory would require a categorical ban on\n    all broadcasts of expletives is not responsive to the actual policy un\n    der review since the FCC has always evaluated the patent offensive\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  ness of words and statements in relation to the context in which they\n  were broadcast. The FCC\u2019s decision to retain some discretion in less\n  egregious cases does not invalidate its regulation of the broadcasts\n  under review. Third, the FCC\u2019s prediction that a per se exemption for\n  fleeting expletives would lead to their increased use merits deference\n  and makes entire sense. Pp. 15\u201318.\n        (d) Fox\u2019s additional arguments are not tenable grounds for affir\n  mance. Fox misconstrues the agency\u2019s orders when it argues that\n  that the new policy is a presumption of indecency for certain words.\n  It reads more into Pacifica than is there by arguing that the FCC\n  failed adequately to explain how this regulation is consistent with\n  that case. And Fox\u2019s argument that the FCC\u2019s repeated appeal to\n  \u201ccontext\u201d is a smokescreen for a standardless regime of unbridled dis\n  cretion ignores the fact that the opinion in Pacifica endorsed a con\n  text-based approach. Pp. 18\u201319.\n     2. Absent a lower court opinion on the matter, this Court declines\n  to address the FCC orders\u2019 constitutionality.

S. C. \u00a71464, which includes\nexpletives referring to sexual or excretory activity or\norgans, see FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726\n(1978). This case concerns the adequacy of the Federal\nCommunications Commission\u2019s explanation of its decision\nthat this sometimes forbids the broadcasting of indecent\nexpletives even when the offensive words are not repeated.\n          I. Statutory and Regulatory Background\n   The Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 47\nU. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), established a\nsystem of limited-term broadcast licenses subject to vari\u00ad\nous \u201cconditions\u201d designed \u201cto maintain the control of the\nUnited States over all the channels of radio transmission,\u201d\n\u00a7301 (2000 ed.). Twenty-seven years ago we said that \u201c[a]\nlicensed broadcaster is granted the free and exclusive use\nof a limited and valuable part of the public domain; when\nhe accepts that franchise it is burdened by enforceable\n2            FCC v.

S. 367, 395\n(1981) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   One of the burdens that licensees shoulder is the inde\u00ad\ncency ban\u2014the statutory proscription against \u201cutter[ing]\nany obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of\nradio communication,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464\u2014which Congress\nhas instructed the Commission to enforce between the\nhours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Public Telecommunications\nAct of 1992, \u00a716(a), 106 Stat. 954, note following 47\nU. S. C. \u00a7303.1 Congress has given the Commission vari\u00ad\nous means of enforcing the indecency ban, including civil\nfines, see \u00a7503(b)(1), and license revocations or the denial\nof license renewals, see \u00a7\u00a7309(k), 312(a)(6).\n   The Commission first invoked the statutory ban on\nindecent broadcasts in 1975, declaring a daytime broad\u00ad\ncast of George Carlin\u2019s \u201cFilthy Words\u201d monologue\nactionably indecent. Pacifica Foundation, 56 F. C. C. 2d\n94. At that time, the Commission announced the defini\u00ad\ntion of indecent speech that it uses to this day, prohibiting\n\u201clanguage that describes, in terms patently offensive as\nmeasured by contemporary community standards for the\nbroadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or or\u00ad\ngans, at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk\nthat children may be in the audience.\u201d Id., at 98.\n   In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, supra, we upheld the\nCommission\u2019s order against statutory and constitutional\nchallenge. We rejected the broadcasters\u2019 argument that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The statutory prohibition applicable to commercial radio and televi\u00ad\n\nsion stations extends by its terms from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight. The\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held, however,\nthat because \u201cCongress and the Commission [had] backed away from\nthe consequences of their own reasoning,\u201d by allowing some public\nbroadcasters to air indecent speech after 10 p.m., the court was forced\n\u201cto hold that the section is unconstitutional insofar as it bars the\nbroadcasting of indecent speech between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and\nmidnight.\u201d Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, 58 F. 3d 654, 669\n(1995) (en banc), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1043 (1996).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statutory proscription applied only to speech appealing\nto the prurient interest, noting that \u201cthe normal definition\nof \u2018indecent\u2019 merely refers to nonconformance with ac\u00ad\ncepted standards of morality.\u201d Id., at 740. And we held\nthat the First Amendment allowed Carlin\u2019s monologue to\nbe banned in light of the \u201cuniquely pervasive presence\u201d of\nthe medium and the fact that broadcast programming is\n\u201cuniquely accessible to children.\u201d Id., at 748\u2013749.\n   In the ensuing years, the Commission took a cautious,\nbut gradually expanding, approach to enforcing the statu\u00ad\ntory prohibition against indecent broadcasts. Shortly after\nPacifica, 438 U. S. 726, the Commission expressed its\n\u201cinten[tion] strictly to observe the narrowness of the\nPacifica holding,\u201d which \u201crelied in part on the repetitive\noccurrence of the \u2018indecent\u2019 words\u201d contained in Carlin\u2019s\nmonologue. In re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation,\n69 F. C. C. 2d 1250, 1254, \u00b610 (1978). When the full Com\u00ad\nmission next considered its indecency standard, however,\nit repudiated the view that its enforcement power was\nlimited to \u201cdeliberate, repetitive use of the seven words\nactually contained in the George Carlin monologue.\u201d In re\nPacifica Foundation, Inc., 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699, \u00b612\n(1987). The Commission determined that such a \u201chighly\nrestricted enforcement standard . . . was unduly narrow as\na matter of law and inconsistent with [the Commission\u2019s]\nenforcement responsibilities under Section 1464.\u201d In re\nInfinity Broadcasting Corp. of Pa., 3 FCC Rcd. 930, \u00b65\n(1987). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit upheld this expanded enforcement standard\nagainst constitutional and Administrative Procedure Act\nchallenge. See Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC,\n852 F. 2d 1332 (1988) (R. Ginsburg, J.), superseded in part\nby Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, 58 F. 3d 654\n(1995) (en banc).\n   Although the Commission had expanded its enforcement\nbeyond the \u201crepetitive use of specific words or phrases,\u201d it\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreserved a distinction between literal and nonliteral (or\n\u201cexpletive\u201d) uses of evocative language. In re Pacifica\nFoundation, Inc., 2 FCC Rcd., at 2699, \u00b613. The Commis\u00ad\nsion explained that each literal \u201cdescription or depiction of\nsexual or excretory functions must be examined in context\nto determine whether it is patently offensive,\u201d but that\n\u201cdeliberate and repetitive use . . . is a requisite to a finding\nof indecency\u201d when a complaint focuses solely on the use of\nnonliteral expletives. Ibid.\n   Over a decade later, the Commission emphasized that\nthe \u201cfull context\u201d in which particular materials appear is\n\u201ccritically important,\u201d but that a few \u201cprincipal\u201d factors\nguide the inquiry, such as the \u201cexplicitness or graphic\nnature\u201d of the material, the extent to which the material\n\u201cdwells on or repeats\u201d the offensive material, and the\nextent to which the material was presented to \u201cpander,\u201d to\n\u201ctitillate,\u201d or to \u201cshock.\u201d In re Industry Guidance On the\nCommission\u2019s Case Law Interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464\nand Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency,\n16 FCC Rcd. 7999, 8002, \u00b69, 8003, \u00b610 (2001) (emphasis\ndeleted). \u201cNo single factor,\u201d the Commission said, \u201cgener\u00ad\nally provides the basis for an indecency finding,\u201d but\n\u201cwhere sexual or excretory references have been made\nonce or have been passing or fleeting in nature, this char\u00ad\nacteristic has tended to weigh against a finding of inde\u00ad\ncency.\u201d Id., at 8003, \u00b610, 8008, \u00b617.\n   In 2004, the Commission took one step further by de\u00ad\nclaring for the first time that a nonliteral (expletive) use of\nthe F- and S-Words could be actionably indecent, even\nwhen the word is used only once. The first order to this\neffect dealt with an NBC broadcast of the Golden Globe\nAwards, in which the performer Bono commented, \u201c \u2018This\nis really, really, f***ing brilliant.\u2019 \u201d In re Complaints\nAgainst Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their\nAiring of the \u201cGolden Globe Awards\u201d Program, 19 FCC\nRcd. 4975, 4976, n. 4 (2004) (Golden Globes Order).

S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthough the Commission had received numerous com\u00ad\nplaints directed at the broadcast, its enforcement bureau\nhad concluded that the material was not indecent because\n\u201cBono did not describe, in context, sexual or excretory\norgans or activities and . . . the utterance was fleeting and\nisolated.\u201d Id., at 4975\u20134976, \u00b63. The full Commission\nreviewed and reversed the staff ruling.\n   The Commission first declared that Bono\u2019s use of the F-\nWord fell within its indecency definition, even though the\nword was used as an intensifier rather than a literal\ndescriptor. \u201c[G]iven the core meaning of the \u2018F-Word,\u2019 \u201d it\nsaid, \u201cany use of that word . . . inherently has a sexual\nconnotation.\u201d Id., at 4978, \u00b68. The Commission deter\u00ad\nmined, moreover, that the broadcast was \u201cpatently offen\u00ad\nsive\u201d because the F-Word \u201cis one of the most vulgar,\ngraphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the\nEnglish language,\u201d because \u201c[i]ts use invariably invokes a\ncoarse sexual image,\u201d and because Bono\u2019s use of the word\nwas entirely \u201cshocking and gratuitous.\u201d Id., at 4979, \u00b69.\n   The Commission observed that categorically exempting\nsuch language from enforcement actions would \u201clikely lead\nto more widespread use.\u201d Ibid. Commission action was\nnecessary to \u201csafeguard the well-being of the nation\u2019s\nchildren from the most objectionable, most offensive lan\u00ad\nguage.\u201d Ibid. The order noted that technological advances\nhave made it far easier to delete (\u201cbleep out\u201d) a \u201csingle and\ngratuitous use of a vulgar expletive,\u201d without adulterating\nthe content of a broadcast. Id., at 4980, \u00b611.\n   The order acknowledged that \u201cprior Commission and\nstaff action have indicated that isolated or fleeting broad\u00ad\ncasts of the \u2018F-Word\u2019 . . . are not indecent or would not be\nacted upon.\u201d It explicitly ruled that \u201cany such interpreta\u00ad\ntion is no longer good law.\u201d Ibid., \u00b612. It \u201cclarif[ied] . . .\nthat the mere fact that specific words or phrases are not\nsustained or repeated does not mandate a finding that\nmaterial that is otherwise patently offensive to the broad\u00ad\n6          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncast medium is not indecent.\u201d Ibid. Because, however,\n\u201cexisting precedent would have permitted this broadcast,\u201d\nthe Commission determined that \u201cNBC and its affiliates\nnecessarily did not have the requisite notice to justify a\npenalty.\u201d Id., at 4981\u20134982, \u00b615.\n                    II. The Present Case\n   This case concerns utterances in two live broadcasts\naired by Fox Television Stations, Inc., and its affiliates\nprior to the Commission\u2019s Golden Globes Order. The first\noccurred during the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, when\nthe singer Cher exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve also had critics for the\nlast 40 years saying that I was on my way out every year.\nRight.

The second\ninvolved a segment of the 2003 Billboard Music Awards,\nduring the presentation of an award by Nicole Richie and\nParis Hilton, principals in a Fox television series called\n\u201cThe Simple Life.\u201d Ms. Hilton began their interchange by\nreminding Ms. Richie to \u201cwatch the bad language,\u201d but\nMs. Richie proceeded to ask the audience, \u201cWhy do they\neven call it \u2018The Simple Life?\u2019 Have you ever tried to get\ncow s*** out of a Prada purse? It\u2019s not so f***ing simple.\u201d\nId., at 9\u201310. Following each of these broadcasts, the Com\u00ad\nmission received numerous complaints from parents\nwhose children were exposed to the language.\n   On March 15, 2006, the Commission released Notices of\nApparent Liability for a number of broadcasts that the\nCommission deemed actionably indecent, including the\ntwo described above. In re Complaints Regarding Various\nTelevision Broadcasts Between February 2, 2002 and\nMarch 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 2664 (2006). Multiple parties\npetitioned the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for\njudicial review of the order, asserting a variety of constitu\u00ad\ntional and statutory challenges. Since the order had\ndeclined to impose sanctions, the Commission had not\npreviously given the broadcasters an opportunity to re\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspond to the indecency charges. It therefore requested\nand obtained from the Court of Appeals a voluntary re\u00ad\nmand so that the parties could air their objections. 489\nF. 3d 444, 453 (2007). The Commission\u2019s order on remand\nupheld the indecency findings for the broadcasts described\nabove. See In re Complaints Regarding Various Television\nBroadcasts Between February 2, 2002, and March 8, 2005,\n21 FCC Rcd. 13299 (2006) (Remand Order).\n   The order first explained that both broadcasts fell com\u00ad\nfortably within the subject-matter scope of the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s indecency test because the 2003 broadcast involved\na literal description of excrement and both broadcasts\ninvoked the \u201cF-Word,\u201d which inherently has a sexual\nconnotation. Id., at 13304, \u00b616, 13323, \u00b658. The order\nnext determined that the broadcasts were patently offen\u00ad\nsive under community standards for the medium. Both\nbroadcasts, it noted, involved entirely gratuitous uses of\n\u201cone of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit words for\nsexual activity in the English language.\u201d Id., at 13305,\n\u00b617, 13324, \u00b659. It found Ms. Richie\u2019s use of the \u201cF-Word\u201d\nand her \u201cexplicit description of the handling of excrement\u201d\nto be \u201cvulgar and shocking,\u201d as well as to constitute \u201cpan\u00ad\ndering,\u201d after Ms. Hilton had playfully warned her to\n\u201c \u2018watch the bad language.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 13305, \u00b617. And it\nfound Cher\u2019s statement patently offensive in part because\nshe metaphorically suggested a sexual act as a means of\nexpressing hostility to her critics. Id., at 13324, \u00b660. The\norder relied upon the \u201ccritically important\u201d context of the\nutterances, id., at 13304, \u00b615, noting that they were aired\nduring prime-time awards shows \u201cdesigned to draw a\nlarge nationwide audience that could be expected to in\u00ad\nclude many children interested in seeing their favorite\nmusic stars,\u201d id., at 13305, \u00b618, 13324, \u00b659. Indeed, ap\u00ad\nproximately 2.5 million minors witnessed each of the\nbroadcasts. Id., at 13306, \u00b618, 13326, \u00b665.\n   The order asserted that both broadcasts under review\n8          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould have been actionably indecent under the staff rul\u00ad\nings and Commission dicta in effect prior to the Golden\nGlobes Order\u2014the 2003 broadcast because it involved a\nliteral description of excrement, rather than a mere exple\u00ad\ntive, because it used more than one offensive word, and\nbecause it was planned, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, \u00b622; and\nthe 2002 broadcast because Cher used the F-Word not as a\nmere intensifier, but as a description of the sexual act to\nexpress hostility to her critics, id., at 13324, \u00b660. The\norder stated, however, that the pre-Golden Globes regime\nof immunity for isolated indecent expletives rested only\nupon staff rulings and Commission dicta, and that the\nCommission itself had never held \u201cthat the isolated use of\nan expletive . . . was not indecent or could not be inde\u00ad\ncent,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, \u00b621. In any event, the order\nmade clear, the Golden Globes Order eliminated any doubt\nthat fleeting expletives could be actionably indecent, 21\nFCC Rcd., at 13308, \u00b623, 13325, \u00b661, and the Commission\ndisavowed the bureau-level decisions and its own dicta\nthat had said otherwise, id., at 13306\u201313307, \u00b6\u00b620, 21.\nUnder the new policy, a lack of repetition \u201cweigh[s]\nagainst a finding of indecency,\u201d id., at 13325, \u00b661, but is\nnot a safe harbor.\n   The order explained that the Commission\u2019s prior \u201cstrict\ndichotomy between \u2018expletives\u2019 and \u2018descriptions or depic\u00ad\ntions of sexual or excretory functions\u2019 is artificial and does\nnot make sense in light of the fact that an \u2018expletive\u2019s\u2019\npower to offend derives from its sexual or excretory mean\u00ad\ning.\u201d Id., at 13308, \u00b623. In the Commission\u2019s view,\n\u201cgranting an automatic exemption for \u2018isolated or fleeting\u2019\nexpletives unfairly forces viewers (including children)\u201d to\ntake \u201c \u2018the first blow\u2019 \u201d and would allow broadcasters \u201cto air\nexpletives at all hours of a day so long as they did so one\nat a time.\u201d Id., at 13309, \u00b625. Although the Commission\ndetermined that Fox encouraged the offensive language by\nusing suggestive scripting in the 2003 broadcast, and\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nunreasonably failed to take adequate precautions in both\nbroadcasts, id., at 13311\u201313314, \u00b6\u00b631\u201337, the order again\ndeclined to impose any forfeiture or other sanction for\neither of the broadcasts, id., at 13321, \u00b653, 13326, \u00b666.\n   Fox returned to the Second Circuit for review of the\nRemand Order, and various intervenors including CBS,\nNBC, and ABC joined the action. The Court of Appeals\nreversed the agency\u2019s orders, finding the Commission\u2019s\nreasoning inadequate under the Administrative Procedure\nAct. 489 F. 3d 444. The majority was \u201cskeptical that the\nCommission [could] provide a reasoned explanation for its\n\u2018fleeting expletive\u2019 regime that would pass constitutional\nmuster,\u201d but it declined to reach the constitutional ques\u00ad\ntion. Id., at 462. Judge Leval dissented, id., at 467. We\ngranted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                        III. Analysis\n                  A. Governing Principles\n  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7551 et\nseq., which sets forth the full extent of judicial authority to\nreview executive agency action for procedural correctness,\nsee Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Re\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 545\u2013549\n(1978), permits (insofar as relevant here) the setting aside\nof agency action that is \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious,\u201d 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). Under what we have called this \u201cnar\u00ad\nrow\u201d standard of review, we insist that an agency \u201cexam\u00ad\nine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory expla\u00ad\nnation for its action.\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United\nStates, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463\nU. S. 29, 43 (1983). We have made clear, however, that \u201ca\ncourt is not to substitute its judgment for that of the\nagency,\u201d ibid., and should \u201cuphold a decision of less than\nideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be dis\u00ad\ncerned,\u201d Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight\nSystem, Inc., 419 U. S. 281, 286 (1974).\n10            FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In overturning the Commission\u2019s judgment, the Court of\nAppeals here relied in part on Circuit precedent requiring\na more substantial explanation for agency action that\nchanges prior policy. The Second Circuit has interpreted\nthe Administrative Procedure Act and our opinion in State\nFarm as requiring agencies to make clear \u201c \u2018why the origi\u00ad\nnal reasons for adopting the [displaced] rule or policy are\nno longer dispositive\u2019 \u201d as well as \u201c \u2018why the new rule effec\u00ad\ntuates the statute as well as or better than the old rule.\u2019 \u201d\n489 F. 3d, at 456\u2013457 (quoting New York Council, Assn. of\nCivilian Technicians v. FLRA, 757 F. 2d 502, 508 (CA2\n1985); emphasis deleted). The Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit has similarly indicated that a\ncourt\u2019s standard of review is \u201cheightened somewhat\u201d when\nan agency reverses course. NAACP v. FCC, 682 F. 2d 993,\n998 (1982).\n   We find no basis in the Administrative Procedure Act or\nin our opinions for a requirement that all agency change\nbe subjected to more searching review. The Act mentions\nno such heightened standard. And our opinion in State\nFarm neither held nor implied that every agency action\nrepresenting a policy change must be justified by reasons\nmore substantial than those required to adopt a policy in\nthe first instance. That case, which involved the rescis\u00ad\nsion of a prior regulation, said only that such action re\u00ad\nquires \u201ca reasoned analysis for the change beyond that\nwhich may be required when an agency does not act in the\nfirst instance.\u201d 463 U. S., at 42 (emphasis added).2 Treat\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s contention that State Farm did anything more,\npost, at 4\u20136 (dissenting opinion), rests upon his failure to observe the\nitalicized phrase and upon a passage quoted in State Farm from a\nplurality opinion in Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade,\n412 U. S. 800 (1973). That passage referred to \u201ca presumption that\n[congressional] policies will be carried out best if the settled rule is\nadhered to.\u201d Id., at 807\u2013808 (opinion of Marshall, J.). But the Atchison\nplurality made this statement in the context of requiring the agency to\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning failures to act and rescissions of prior action differ\u00ad\nently for purposes of the standard of review makes good\nsense, and has basis in the text of the statute, which\nlikewise treats the two separately. It instructs a review\u00ad\ning court to \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or\nunreasonably delayed,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(1), and to \u201chold\nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and con\u00ad\nclusions found to be [among other things] . . . arbitrary [or]\ncapricious,\u201d \u00a7706(2)(A). The statute makes no distinction,\nhowever, between initial agency action and subsequent\nagency action undoing or revising that action.\n   To be sure, the requirement that an agency provide\nreasoned explanation for its action would ordinarily de\u00ad\nmand that it display awareness that it is changing posi\u00ad\ntion. An agency may not, for example, depart from a prior\npolicy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still\non the books. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683,\n696 (1974). And of course the agency must show that\nthere are good reasons for the new policy. But it need not\ndemonstrate to a court\u2019s satisfaction that the reasons for\nthe new policy are better than the reasons for the old one;\nit suffices that the new policy is permissible under the\nstatute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the\nagency believes it to be better, which the conscious change\nof course adequately indicates. This means that the\nagency need not always provide a more detailed justifica\u00ad\ntion than what would suffice for a new policy created on a\nblank slate. Sometimes it must\u2014when, for example, its\nnew policy rests upon factual findings that contradict\nthose which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprovide some explanation for a change, \u201cso that the reviewing court\nmay understand the basis of the agency\u2019s action and so may judge the\nconsistency of that action with the agency\u2019s mandate,\u201d id., at 808. The\nopinion did not assert the authority of a court to demand explanation\nsufficient to enable it to weigh (by its own lights) the merits of the\nagency\u2019s change. Nor did our opinion in State Farm.\n12            FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy has engendered serious reliance interests that must\nbe taken into account. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota),\nN. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996). It would be arbitrary or\ncapricious to ignore such matters. In such cases it is not\nthat further justification is demanded by the mere fact of\npolicy change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed\nfor disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or\nwere engendered by the prior policy.\n   In this appeal from the Second Circuit\u2019s setting aside of\nCommission action for failure to comply with a procedural\nrequirement of the Administrative Procedure Act, the\nbroadcasters\u2019 arguments have repeatedly referred to the\nFirst Amendment. If they mean to invite us to apply a\nmore stringent arbitrary-and-capricious review to agency\nactions that implicate constitutional liberties, we reject\nthe invitation. The so-called canon of constitutional\navoidance is an interpretive tool, counseling that ambigu\u00ad\nous statutory language be construed to avoid serious\nconstitutional doubts. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.\nFlorida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council,\n485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). We know of no precedent for\napplying it to limit the scope of authorized executive ac\u00ad\ntion. In the same section authorizing courts to set aside\n\u201carbitrary [or] capricious\u201d agency action, the Administra\u00ad\ntive Procedure Act separately provides for setting aside\nagency action that is \u201cunlawful,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A),\nwhich of course includes unconstitutional action. We\nthink that is the only context in which constitutionality\nbears upon judicial review of authorized agency action. If\nthe Commission\u2019s action here was not arbitrary or capri\u00ad\ncious in the ordinary sense, it satisfies the Administrative\nProcedure Act\u2019s \u201carbitrary [or] capricious\u201d standard; its\nlawfulness under the Constitution is a separate question\nto be addressed in a constitutional challenge.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 JUSTICE   BREYER claims that \u201c[t]he Court has often applied [the doc\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                 B. Application to This Case\n   Judged under the above described standards, the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s new enforcement policy and its order finding the\nbroadcasts actionably indecent were neither arbitrary nor\ncapricious. First, the Commission forthrightly acknowl\u00ad\nedged that its recent actions have broken new ground,\ntaking account of inconsistent \u201cprior Commission and staff\naction\u201d and explicitly disavowing them as \u201cno longer good\nlaw.\u201d Golden Globes Order, 19 FCC Rcd., at 4980, \u00b612. To\nbe sure, the (superfluous) explanation in its Remand\nOrder of why the Cher broadcast would even have violated\nits earlier policy may not be entirely convincing. But that\nunnecessary detour is irrelevant. There is no doubt that\nthe Commission knew it was making a change. That is\nwhy it declined to assess penalties; and it relied on the\nGolden Globes Order as removing any lingering doubt.\nRemand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \u00b623, 13325, \u00b661.\n   Moreover, the agency\u2019s reasons for expanding the scope\nof its enforcement activity were entirely rational. It was\ncertainly reasonable to determine that it made no sense to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntrine of constitutional avoidance] where an agency\u2019s regulation relies on\na plausible but constitutionally suspect interpretation of a statute.\u201d\nPost, at 21. The cases he cites, however, set aside an agency regulation\nbecause, applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to the am\u00ad\nbiguous statute under which the agency acted, the Court found the\nagency\u2019s interpretation of the statute erroneous. See Solid Waste\nAgency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S.\n159, 174 (2001); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490,\n507 (1979). But JUSTICE BREYER does not urge that we issue such a\nholding, evidently agreeing that we should limit our review to what the\nCourt of Appeals decided, see Part IV, infra\u2014which included only the\nadequacy of the Commission\u2019s rulemaking procedure, and not the\nstatutory question. Rather, JUSTICE BREYER seeks a \u201cremand [that]\nwould do no more than ask the agency to reconsider its policy decision\nin light of\u201d constitutional concerns. Post, at 21. That strange and novel\ndisposition would be entirely unrelated to the doctrine of constitutional\navoidance, and would better be termed the doctrine of judicial arm\u00ad\ntwisting or appellate review by the wagged finger.\n14         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndistinguish between literal and nonliteral uses of offensive\nwords, requiring repetitive use to render only the latter\nindecent. As the Commission said with regard to expletive\nuse of the F-Word, \u201cthe word\u2019s power to insult and offend\nderives from its sexual meaning.\u201d Id., at 13323, \u00b658. And\nthe Commission\u2019s decision to look at the patent offensive\u00ad\nness of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words\nfits with the context-based approach we sanctioned in\nPacifica, 438 U. S., at 750. Even isolated utterances can\nbe made in \u201cpander[ing,] . . . vulgar and shocking\u201d man\u00ad\nners, Remand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13305, \u00b617, and can\nconstitute harmful \u201c \u2018first blow[s]\u2019 \u201d to children, id., at\n13309, \u00b625. It is surely rational (if not inescapable) to\nbelieve that a safe harbor for single words would \u201clikely\nlead to more widespread use of the offensive language,\u201d\nGolden Globes Order, supra, at 4979, \u00b69.\n   When confronting other requests for per se rules govern\u00ad\ning its enforcement of the indecency prohibition, the\nCommission has declined to create safe harbors for par\u00ad\nticular types of broadcasts. See In re Pacifica Foundation,\nInc., 2 FCC Rcd., at 2699, \u00b612 (repudiating the view that\nthe Commission\u2019s enforcement power was limited to \u201cde\u00ad\nliberate, repetitive use of the seven words actually con\u00ad\ntained in the George Carlin monologue\u201d); In re Infinity\nBroadcasting Corp. of Pa., 3 FCC Rcd., at 932, \u00b617 (\u201cre\u00ad\nject[ing] an approach that would hold that if a work has\nmerit, it is per se not indecent\u201d). The Commission could\nrationally decide it needed to step away from its old re\u00ad\ngime where nonrepetitive use of an expletive was per se\nnonactionable because that was \u201cat odds with the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s overall enforcement policy.\u201d Remand Order,\nsupra, at 13308, \u00b623.\n   The fact that technological advances have made it easier\nfor broadcasters to bleep out offending words further\nsupports the Commission\u2019s stepped-up enforcement policy.\nGolden Globes Order, supra, at 4980, \u00b611.

The Court of Appeals\u2019 Reasoning\n    The Court of Appeals found the Commission\u2019s action\narbitrary and capricious on three grounds. First, the court\ncriticized the Commission for failing to explain why it had\nnot previously banned fleeting expletives as \u201charmful \u2018first\nblow[s].\u2019 \u201d 489 F. 3d, at 458. In the majority\u2019s view, with\u00ad\nout \u201cevidence that suggests a fleeting expletive is harmful\n[and] . . . serious enough to warrant government regula\u00ad\ntion,\u201d the agency could not regulate more broadly. Id., at\n461. As explained above, the fact that an agency had a\nprior stance does not alone prevent it from changing its\nview or create a higher hurdle for doing so. And it is not\nthe Commission, but Congress that has proscribed \u201cany\n. . . indecent . . . language.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464.\n    There are some propositions for which scant empirical\nevidence can be marshaled, and the harmful effect of\nbroadcast profanity on children is one of them. One can\u00ad\nnot demand a multiyear controlled study, in which some\nchildren are intentionally exposed to indecent broadcasts\n(and insulated from all other indecency), and others are\nshielded from all indecency. It is one thing to set aside\nagency action under the Administrative Procedure Act\nbecause of failure to adduce empirical data that can read\u00ad\nily be obtained. See, e.g., State Farm, 463 U. S., at 46\u201356\n(addressing the costs and benefits of mandatory passive\nrestraints for automobiles). It is something else to insist\nupon obtaining the unobtainable. Here it suffices to know\nthat children mimic the behavior they observe\u2014or at least\nthe behavior that is presented to them as normal and\nappropriate. Programming replete with one-word inde\u00ad\ncent expletives will tend to produce children who use (at\n16         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleast) one-word indecent expletives. Congress has made\nthe determination that indecent material is harmful to\nchildren, and has left enforcement of the ban to the Com\u00ad\nmission. If enforcement had to be supported by empirical\ndata, the ban would effectively be a nullity.\n  The Commission had adduced no quantifiable measure\nof the harm caused by the language in Pacifica, and we\nnonetheless held that the \u201cgovernment\u2019s interest in the\n\u2018well-being of its youth\u2019 . . . justified the regulation of\notherwise protected expression.\u201d 438 U. S., at 749 (quot\u00ad\ning Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 640, 639 (1968)).\nIf the Constitution itself demands of agencies no more\nscientifically certain criteria to comply with the First\nAmendment, neither does the Administrative Procedure\nAct to comply with the requirement of reasoned decision\u00ad\nmaking.\n  The court\u2019s second objection is that fidelity to the\nagency\u2019s \u201cfirst blow\u201d theory of harm would require a cate\u00ad\ngorical ban on all broadcasts of expletives; the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s failure to go to this extreme thus undermined the\ncoherence of its rationale. 489 F. 3d, at 458\u2013459. This\nobjection, however, is not responsive to the Commission\u2019s\nactual policy under review\u2014the decision to include pat\u00ad\nently offensive fleeting expletives within the definition of\nindecency. The Commission\u2019s prior enforcement practice,\nunchallenged here, already drew distinctions between the\noffensiveness of particular words based upon the context\nin which they appeared. Any complaint about the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s failure to ban only some fleeting expletives is\nbetter directed at the agency\u2019s context-based system gen\u00ad\nerally rather than its inclusion of isolated expletives.\n  More fundamentally, however, the agency\u2019s decision to\nconsider the patent offensiveness of isolated expletives on\na case-by-case basis is not arbitrary or capricious. \u201cEven a\nprime-time recitation of Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Miller\u2019s Tale,\u201d\nwe have explained, \u201cwould not be likely to command the\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

The same rationale could\nsupport the Commission\u2019s finding that a broadcast of the\nfilm Saving Private Ryan was not indecent\u2014a finding to\nwhich the broadcasters point as supposed evidence of the\nCommission\u2019s inconsistency. The frightening suspense\nand the graphic violence in the movie could well dissuade\nthe most vulnerable from watching and would put parents\non notice of potentially objectionable material. See In re\nComplaints Against Various Television Licensees Regard\ning Their Broadcast on Nov. 11, 2004 of the ABC Televi\nsion Network\u2019s Presentation of the Film \u201cSaving Private\nRyan,\u201d 20 FCC Rcd. 4507, 4513, \u00b615 (2005) (noting that\nthe broadcast was not \u201cintended as family entertain\u00ad\nment\u201d). The agency\u2019s decision to retain some discretion\ndoes not render arbitrary or capricious its regulation of\nthe deliberate and shocking uses of offensive language at\nthe award shows under review\u2014shows that were expected\nto (and did) draw the attention of millions of children.\n   Finally, the Court of Appeals found unconvincing the\nagency\u2019s prediction (without any evidence) that a per se\nexemption for fleeting expletives would lead to increased\nuse of expletives one at a time. 489 F. 3d, at 460. But\neven in the absence of evidence, the agency\u2019s predictive\njudgment (which merits deference) makes entire sense. To\npredict that complete immunity for fleeting expletives,\nardently desired by broadcasters, will lead to a substantial\nincrease in fleeting expletives seems to us an exercise in\nlogic rather than clairvoyance. The Court of Appeals was\nperhaps correct that the Commission\u2019s prior policy had not\nyet caused broadcasters to \u201cbarrag[e] the airwaves with\nexpletives,\u201d ibid. That may have been because its prior\npermissive policy had been confirmed (save in dicta) only\nat the staff level. In any event, as the Golden Globes order\ndemonstrated, it did produce more expletives than the\n18         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission (which has the first call in this matter)\ndeemed in conformity with the statute.\n                D. Respondents\u2019 Arguments\n  Respondents press some arguments that the court did\nnot adopt. They claim that the Commission failed to\nacknowledge its change in enforcement policy. That con\u00ad\ntention is not tenable in light of the Golden Globes Order\u2019s\nspecific declaration that its prior rulings were no longer\ngood law, 19 FCC Rcd., at 4980, \u00b612, and the Remand\nOrder\u2019s disavowal of those staff rulings and Commission\ndicta as \u201cseriously flawed,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \u00b623.\nThe broadcasters also try to recharacterize the nature of\nthe Commission\u2019s shift, contending that the old policy was\nnot actually a per se rule against liability for isolated\nexpletives and that the new policy is a presumption of\nindecency for certain words. This description of the prior\nagency policy conflicts with the broadcasters\u2019 own prior\nposition in this case. See, e.g., Brief in Opposition for\nRespondent Fox Television Stations, Inc., et al. 4 (\u201cFor\nalmost 30 years following Pacifica, the FCC did not con\u00ad\nsider fleeting, isolated or inadvertent expletives to be\nindecent\u201d). And we find no basis for the contention that\nthe Commission has now adopted a presumption of inde\u00ad\ncency; its repeated reliance on context refutes this claim.\n  The broadcasters also make much of the fact that the\nCommission has gone beyond the scope of authority ap\u00ad\nproved in Pacifica, which it once regarded as the farthest\nextent of its power. But we have never held that Pacifica\nrepresented the outer limits of permissible regulation, so\nthat fleeting expletives may not be forbidden. To the\ncontrary, we explicitly left for another day whether \u201can\noccasional expletive\u201d in \u201ca telecast of an Elizabethan\ncomedy\u201d could be prohibited. 438 U. S., at 748.

Nothing\nprohibits federal agencies from moving in an incremental\nmanner. Cf. National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.\nv. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 1002 (2005).\n   Finally, the broadcasters claim that the Commission\u2019s\nrepeated appeal to \u201ccontext\u201d is simply a smokescreen for a\nstandardless regime of unbridled discretion. But we have\npreviously approved Commission regulation based \u201con a\nnuisance rationale under which context is all-important,\u201d\nPacifica, supra, at 750, and we find no basis in the Admin\u00ad\nistrative Procedure Act for mandating anything different.\n                E. The Dissents\u2019 Arguments\n   JUSTICE BREYER purports to \u201cbegin with applicable law,\u201d\npost, at 1, but in fact begins by stacking the deck. He\nclaims that the FCC\u2019s status as an \u201cindependent\u201d agency\nsheltered from political oversight requires courts to be \u201call\nthe more\u201d vigilant in ensuring \u201cthat major policy decisions\nbe based upon articulable reasons.\u201d Post, at 1, 2. Not so.\nThe independent agencies are sheltered not from politics\nbut from the President, and it has often been observed\nthat their freedom from presidential oversight (and protec\u00ad\ntion) has simply been replaced by increased subservience\nto congressional direction.

Members\nof the Subcommittee specifically \u201ccalled on the full Commission to\nreverse [the staff ruling in the Golden Globes case]\u201d because they\nperceived a \u201cfeeling amongst many Americans that some broadcasters\nare engaged in a race to the bottom, pushing the decency envelope to\ndistinguish themselves in the increasingly crowded entertainment\nfield.\u201d Id., at 2 (statement of Rep. Upton); see also, e.g., id., at 17\n(statement of Rep. Terry), 19 (statement of Rep. Pitts). They repeatedly\nexpressed disapproval of the FCC\u2019s enforcement policies, see, e.g., id.,\nat 3 (statement of Rep. Upton) (\u201cAt some point we have to ask the FCC:\nHow much is enough?

R 3717 before the Subcommittee on Telecommunica\u00ad\ntions and the Internet of the House Committee on Energy and Com\u00ad\nmerce, 108th Cong., 2d Sess.

Terry) (\u201cChairman Powell, . . . it seems like common\nsense that if we had . . . more frequent enforcement instead of a few\nexamples of fines . . . that would be a deterrent in itself\u201d); id., at 7\n(statement of Rep. Dingell) (\u201cI see that apparently . . . there is no\nenforcement of regulations at the FCC\u201d). Certain statements, more\u00ad\nover, indicate that the political pressure applied by Congress had its\ndesired effect. See ibid. (\u201cI think our committee\u2019s work has gotten the\nattention of FCC Chairman Powell and the Bush Administration.

In his judgment,\nthe FCC is \u201cbetter viewed as an agent of Congress\u201d than\nas part of the Executive. Post, at 3 (dissenting opinion).\nHe nonetheless argues that this is a good reason for re\u00ad\nquiring the FCC to explain \u201cwhy its prior policy is no\nlonger sound before allowing it to change course.\u201d Post, at\n4. Leaving aside the unconstitutionality of a scheme\ngiving the power to enforce laws to agents of Congress, see\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986), it seems to us\nthat JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 conclusion does not follow from his\npremise. If the FCC is indeed an agent of Congress, it\nwould seem an adequate explanation of its change of\nposition that Congress made clear its wishes for stricter\nenforcement, see n. 4, supra.5 The Administrative Proce\u00ad\ndure Act, after all, does not apply to Congress and its\nagencies.6\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS accuses us of equating statements made in a con\u00ad\n\ngressional hearing with the intent of Congress. Post, at 4, n. 3. In this\nopinion, we do not. The intent of the full Congress (or at least a major\u00ad\nity of each House) is thought relevant to the interpretation of statutes,\nsince they must be passed by the entire Congress. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. I, \u00a77. It is quite irrelevant, however, to the extrastatutory influ\u00ad\nence Congress exerts over agencies of the Executive Branch, which is\nexerted by the congressional committees responsible for oversight and\nappropriations with respect to the relevant agency. That is a major\nreason why committee assignments are important, and committee\nchairmanships powerful. Surely JUSTICE STEVENS knows this.\n   6 The Administrative Procedure Act defines \u201cagency\u201d to mean \u201ceach\n\nauthority of the Government of the United States,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7551(1),\nbut specifically excludes \u201cthe Congress,\u201d \u00a7551(1)(A). The Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has \u201cinterpreted [this]\nexemption for \u2018the Congress\u2019 to mean the entire legislative branch,\u201d\nWashington Legal Foundation v.

The Administrative Procedure\nAct, which provides judicial review, makes no distinction\nbetween independent and other agencies, neither in its\ndefinition of agency, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701(b)(1), nor in the stan\u00ad\ndards for reviewing agency action, \u00a7706. Nor does any\ncase of ours express or reflect the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d\nJUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE STEVENS would impose.\nIndeed, it is hard to imagine any closer scrutiny than that\nwe have given to the Environmental Protection Agency,\nwhich is not an independent agency. See Massachusetts v.\nEPA, 549 U. S. 497, 533\u2013535 (2007); Whitman v. American\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 481\u2013486 (2001).\nThere is no reason to magnify the separation-of-powers\ndilemma posed by the Headless Fourth Branch, see Frey\ntag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 921 (1991) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment), by letting\nArticle III judges\u2014like jackals stealing the lion\u2019s kill\u2014\nexpropriate some of the power that Congress has wrested\nfrom the unitary Executive.\n  JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE STEVENS rely upon two\nsupposed omissions in the FCC\u2019s analysis that they believe\npreclude a finding that the agency did not act arbitrarily.\nNeither of these omissions could undermine the coherence\nof the rationale the agency gave, but the dissenters\u2019\nevaluation of each is flawed in its own right.\n  First, both claim that the Commission failed adequately\nto explain its consideration of the constitutional issues\ninherent in its regulation, post, at 7\u201311 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.); post, at 4\u20137 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). We are\nunaware that we have ever before reversed an executive\nagency, not for violating our cases, but for failure to dis\u00ad\ncuss them adequately. But leave that aside. According to\nJUSTICE BREYER, the agency said \u201cnext to nothing about\nthe relation between the change it made in its prior \u2018fleet\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

The Remand\nOrder does, however, devote four full pages of small-type,\nsingle-spaced text (over 1,300 words not counting the\nfootnotes) to explaining why the Commission believes that\nits indecency-enforcement regime (which includes its\nchange in policy) is consistent with the First Amend\u00ad\nment\u2014and therefore not censorship as the term is under\u00ad\nstood. More specifically, JUSTICE BREYER faults the FCC\nfor \u201cnot explain[ing] why the agency changed its mind\nabout the line that Pacifica draws or its policy\u2019s relation to\nthat line,\u201d post, at 10. But in fact (and as the Commission\nexplained) this Court\u2019s holding in Pacifica, 438 U. S. 726,\ndrew no constitutional line; to the contrary, it expressly\ndeclined to express any view on the constitutionality of\nprohibiting isolated indecency. JUSTICE BREYER and\nJUSTICE STEVENS evidently believe that when an agency\nhas obtained this Court\u2019s determination that a less restric\u00ad\ntive rule is constitutional, its successors acquire some\nspecial burden to explain why a more restrictive rule is\nnot unconstitutional. We know of no such principle.7\n   Second, JUSTICE BREYER looks over the vast field of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes us for \u201cassuming that Pacifica endorsed\u201d\n\nthe enforcement at issue here. Post, at 4. We do nothing of the sort.\nWe rely on the fact that certain aspects of the agency\u2019s decision mirror\nthe context-based approach Pacifica approved, supra, at 14, but that\ngoes to our holding on administrative law, and says nothing about\nconstitutionality. JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that heightened defer\u00ad\nence should be due the FCC\u2019s prior policy because the \u201cFCC\u2019s initial\nviews . . . reflect the views of the Congress that delegated the Commis\u00ad\nsion authority to flesh out details not fully defined in the enacting\nstatute.\u201d Post, at 3. We do not believe that the dead hand of a departed\nCongressional oversight Committee should constrain the discretion that\nthe text of a statute confers\u2014but the point is in any event irrelevant in\nthis appeal, which concerns not whether the agency has exceeded its\nstatutory mandate but whether the reasons for its actions are ade\u00ad\nquate.\n24         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                                 the Court\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nparticular factual scenarios unaddressed by the FCC\u2019s 35\u00ad\npage Remand Order and finds one that is fatal: the plight\nof the small local broadcaster who cannot afford the new\ntechnology that enables the screening of live broadcasts\nfor indecent utterances. Cf. post, at 11\u201316. The Commis\u00ad\nsion has failed to address the fate of this unfortunate, who\nwill, he believes, be subject to sanction.\n   We doubt, to begin with, that small-town broadcasters\nrun a heightened risk of liability for indecent utterances.\nIn programming that they originate, their down-home\nlocal guests probably employ vulgarity less than big-city\nfolks; and small-town stations generally cannot afford or\ncannot attract foul-mouthed glitteratae from Hollywood.\nTheir main exposure with regard to self-originated pro\u00ad\ngramming is live coverage of news and public affairs. But\nthe Remand Order went out of its way to note that the\ncase at hand did not involve \u201cbreaking news coverage,\u201d\nand that \u201cit may be inequitable to hold a licensee respon\u00ad\nsible for airing offensive speech during live coverage of a\npublic event,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13311, \u00b633. As for the\nprogramming that small stations receive on a network\n\u201cfeed\u201d: This will be cleansed by the expensive technology\nsmall stations (by JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s hypothesis) cannot\nafford.\n   But never mind the detail of whether small broadcasters\nare uniquely subject to a great risk of punishment for\nfleeting expletives. The fundamental fallacy of JUSTICE\nBREYER\u2019s small-broadcaster gloomyscenario is its demon\u00ad\nstrably false assumption that the Remand Order makes no\nprovision for the avoidance of unfairness\u2014that the single\u00ad\nutterance prohibition will be invoked uniformly, in all\nsituations. The Remand Order made very clear that this\nis not the case. It said that in determining \u201cwhat, if any,\nremedy is appropriate\u201d the Commission would consider\nthe facts of each individual case, such as the \u201cpossibility of\nhuman error in using delay equipment,\u201d id., at 13313, \u00b635.\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 25\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nThus, the fact that the agency believed that Fox (a large\nbroadcaster that used suggestive scripting and a deficient\ndelay system to air a prime-time awards show aimed at\nmillions of children) \u201cfail[ed] to exercise \u2018reasonable judg\u00ad\nment, responsibility and sensitivity,\u2019 \u201d id., at 13311, \u00b633,\nand n. 91 (quoting Pacifica Foundation, Inc., 2 FCC Rcd.,\nat 2700, \u00b618), says little about how the Commission would\ntreat smaller broadcasters who cannot afford screening\nequipment. Indeed, that they would not be punished for\nfailing to purchase equipment they cannot afford is posi\u00ad\ntively suggested by the Remand Order\u2019s statement that\n\u201c[h]olding Fox responsible for airing indecent material in\nthis case does not . . . impose undue burdens on broadcast\u00ad\ners.\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13313, \u00b636.\n   There was, in sum, no need for the Commission to com\u00ad\npose a special treatise on local broadcasters.8          And\nJUSTICE BREYER can safely defer his concern for those\nyeomen of the airwaves until we have before us a case that\ninvolves one.\n                     IV. Constitutionality\n  The Second Circuit did not definitively rule on the con\u00ad\nstitutionality of the Commission\u2019s orders, but respondents\nnonetheless ask us to decide their validity under the First\nAmendment. This Court, however, is one of final review,\n\u201cnot of first view.\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718,\nn. 7 (2005). It is conceivable that the Commission\u2019s orders\nmay cause some broadcasters to avoid certain language\nthat is beyond the Commission\u2019s reach under the Consti\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 JUSTICE BREYER posits that the FCC would have been required to\ngive more explanation had it used notice-and-comment rulemaking,\nwhich \u201cshould lead us to the same conclusion\u201d in this review of the\nagency\u2019s change through adjudication. Post, at 17.

See Red Lion Broadcast\ning Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969); FCC v. Pacifica\nFoundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). Red Lion and Pacifica\nwere unconvincing when they were issued, and the pas\nsage of time has only increased doubt regarding their\ncontinued validity. \u201cThe text of the First Amendment\nmakes no distinctions among print, broadcast, and cable\nmedia, but we have done so\u201d in these cases. Denver Area\nEd. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518\nU. S. 727, 812 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part).\n   In Red Lion, this Court upheld the so-called \u201cfairness\ndoctrine,\u201d a Government requirement \u201cthat discussion of\npublic issues be presented on broadcast stations, and that\neach side of those issues must be given fair coverage.\u201d 395\nU. S., at 369, 400\u2013401. The decision relied heavily on the\n2          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nscarcity of available broadcast frequencies. According to\nthe Court, because broadcast spectrum was so scarce, it\n\u201ccould be regulated and rationalized only by the Govern\nment. Without government control, the medium would be\nof little use because of the cacophony of competing voices,\nnone of which could be clearly and predictably heard.\u201d Id.,\nat 376. To this end, the Court concluded that the Gov\nernment should be \u201cpermitted to put restraints on licen\nsees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on\nthis unique medium.\u201d Id., at 390; see also id., at 389\n(concluding that \u201cas far as the First Amendment is con\ncerned those who are licensed stand no better than those\nto whom licenses are refused\u201d). Applying this principle,\nthe Court held that \u201c[i]t does not violate the First\nAmendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using\nscarce radio frequencies as proxies for the entire commu\nnity, obligated to give suitable time and attention to mat\nters of great public concern.\u201d Id., at 394.\n  Red Lion specifically declined to answer whether the\nFirst Amendment authorized the Government\u2019s \u201crefusal to\npermit the broadcaster to carry a particular program or to\npublish his own views[,] . . . [or] government censorship of\na particular program,\u201d id., at 396. But then in Pacifica,\nthis Court rejected a challenge to the FCC\u2019s authority to\nimpose sanctions on the broadcast of indecent material.\nSee 438 U. S., at 729\u2013730, 750\u2013751; id., at 742 (plurality\nopinion), relying on Red Lion, the Court noted that \u201cbroad\ncasting . . . has received the most limited First Amend\nment protection.\u201d 438 U. S., at 748. The Court also em\nphasized the \u201cuniquely pervasive presence\u201d of the\nbroadcast media in Americans\u2019 lives and the fact that\nbroadcast programming was \u201cuniquely accessible to chil\ndren.\u201d Id., at 748\u2013749.\n  This deep intrusion into the First Amendment rights of\nbroadcasters, which the Court has justified based only on\nthe nature of the medium, is problematic on two levels.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nFirst, instead of looking to first principles to evaluate the\nconstitutional question, the Court relied on a set of transi\ntory facts, e.g., the \u201cscarcity of radio frequencies,\u201d Red\nLion, supra, at 390, to determine the applicable First\nAmendment standard. But the original meaning of the\nConstitution cannot turn on modern necessity: \u201cConstitu\ntional rights are enshrined with the scope they were un\nderstood to have when the people adopted them, whether\nor not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think\nthat scope too broad.\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller, 554\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 63). In breaching this\nprinciple, Red Lion adopted, and Pacifica reaffirmed, a\nlegal rule that lacks any textual basis in the Constitution.\nDenver Area, supra, at 813 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cFirst Amend\nment distinctions between media [have been] dubious from\ntheir infancy\u201d). Indeed, the logical weakness of Red Lion\nand Pacifica has been apparent for some time: \u201cIt is cer\ntainly true that broadcast frequencies are scarce but it is\nunclear why that fact justifies content regulation of broad\ncasting in a way that would be intolerable if applied to the\neditorial process of the print media.\u201d Telecommunications\nResearch & Action Center v. FCC, 801 F. 2d 501, 508\n(CADC 1986) (Bork, J.).\n   Highlighting the doctrinal incoherence of Red Lion and\nPacifica, the Court has declined to apply the lesser stan\ndard of First Amendment scrutiny imposed on broadcast\nspeech to federal regulation of telephone dial-in services,\nsee Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S.\n115, 127\u2013128 (1989), cable television programming, see\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,\n637 (1994), and the Internet, see Reno v. American Civil\nLiberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867\u2013868 (1997). \u201cThere is\nno justification for this apparent dichotomy in First\nAmendment jurisprudence.

The justifica\ntions relied on by the Court in Red Lion and Pacifica\u2014\n\u201cspectrum scarcity, intrusiveness, and accessibility to\nchildren\u2014neither distinguish broadcast from cable, nor\nexplain the relaxed application of the principles of the\nFirst Amendment to broadcast.\u201d 58 F. 3d, at 673; see also\nIn re Industry Guidance on Commission\u2019s Case Law Inter\npreting 18 U.

American Civil Liberties\nUnion, 521 U. S. 844 (1997)], than would the same exact\ncontent broadcast over-the-air\u201d).\n   Second, even if this Court\u2019s disfavored treatment of\nbroadcasters under the First Amendment could have been\njustified at the time of Red Lion and Pacifica, dramatic\ntechnological advances have eviscerated the factual as\nsumptions underlying those decisions. Broadcast spec\ntrum is significantly less scarce than it was 40 years ago.\nSee Brief for Respondents NBC Universal et al. 37\u201338\n(hereinafter NBC Brief). As NBC notes, the number of\nover-the-air broadcast stations grew from 7,411 in 1969,\nwhen Red Lion was issued, to 15,273 by the end of 2004.\nSee NBC Brief 38; see also FCC Media Bureau Staff Re\nsearch Paper, J. Berresford, The Scarcity Rationale for\nRegulating Traditional Broadcasting: An Idea Whose Time\nHas Passed 12\u201313 (Mar. 2005) (No. 2005\u20132). And the\ntrend should continue with broadcast television\u2019s immi\nnent switch from analog to digital transmission, which\nwill allow the FCC to \u201cstack broadcast channels right\nbeside one another along the spectrum, and ultimately\nutilize significantly less than the 400 MHz of spectrum the\nanalog system absorbs today.\u201d Consumer Electronics\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

For most consumers, traditional broadcast media\nprogramming is now bundled with cable or satellite ser\nvices. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a. Broadcast and\nother video programming is also widely available over the\nInternet. See Stelter, Serving Up Television Without the\nTV Set, N. Y. Times, Mar. 10, 2008, p. C1. And like radio\nand television broadcasts, Internet access is now often\nfreely available over the airwaves and can be accessed by\nportable computer, cell phones, and other wireless devices.\nSee May, Charting a New Constitutional Jurisprudence\nfor the Digital Age, 3 Charleston L. Rev. 373, 375 (2009).\nThe extant facts that drove this Court to subject broad\ncasters to unique disfavor under the First Amendment\nsimply do not exist today. See In re Industry Guidance,\nsupra, at 8020 (statement of Commissioner Furchtgott-\nRoth) (\u201cIf rules regulating broadcast content were ever a\njustifiable infringement of speech, it was because of the\nrelative dominance of that medium in the communications\nmarketplace of the past.

This separate writing is to underscore certain\nbackground principles for the conclusion that an agency\u2019s\ndecision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious\nif the agency sets a new course that reverses an earlier\ndetermination but does not provide a reasoned explana\u00ad\ntion for doing so. In those circumstances I agree with the\ndissenting opinion of JUSTICE BREYER that the agency\nmust explain why \u201cit now reject[s] the considerations that\nled it to adopt that initial policy.\u201d Post, at 5.\n   The question whether a change in policy requires an\nagency to provide a more-reasoned explanation than when\nthe original policy was first announced is not susceptible,\nin my view, to an answer that applies in all cases. There\nmay be instances when it becomes apparent to an agency\nthat the reasons for a longstanding policy have been al\u00ad\ntered by discoveries in science, advances in technology, or\nby any of the other forces at work in a dynamic society. If\nan agency seeks to respond to new circumstances by modi\u00ad\nfying its earlier policy, the agency may have a substantial\nbody of data and experience that can shape and inform the\n2          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nnew rule. In other cases the altered circumstances may be\nso new that the agency must make predictive judgments\nthat are as difficult now as when the agency\u2019s earlier\npolicy was first announced. Reliance interests in the prior\npolicy may also have weight in the analysis.\n   The question in each case is whether the agency\u2019s rea\u00ad\nsons for the change, when viewed in light of the data\navailable to it, and when informed by the experience and\nexpertise of the agency, suffice to demonstrate that the\nnew policy rests upon principles that are rational, neutral,\nand in accord with the agency\u2019s proper understanding of\nits authority. That showing may be required if the agency\nis to demonstrate that its action is not \u201carbitrary, capri\u00ad\ncious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor\u00ad\ndance with law.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). And, of course, the\nagency action must not be \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdic\u00ad\ntion, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\u201d\n\u00a7706(2)(C).\n   These requirements stem from the administrative\nagency\u2019s unique constitutional position. The dynamics of\nthe three branches of Government are well understood as\na general matter. But the role and position of the agency,\nand the exact locus of its powers, present questions that\nare delicate, subtle, and complex. The Federal Govern\u00ad\nment could not perform its duties in a responsible and\neffective way without administrative agencies. Yet the\namorphous character of the administrative agency in the\nconstitutional system escapes simple explanation.\n   If agencies were permitted unbridled discretion, their\nactions might violate important constitutional principles\nof separation of powers and checks and balances. To that\nend the Constitution requires that Congress\u2019 delegation of\nlawmaking power to an agency must be \u201cspecific and\ndetailed.\u201d Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 374\n(1989). Congress must \u201cclearly delineat[e] the general\npolicy\u201d an agency is to achieve and must specify the\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Id., at 372\n(quoting J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276\nU. S. 394, 409 (1928)).\n   Congress passed the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA) to ensure that agencies follow constraints even as\nthey exercise their powers. One of these constraints is the\nduty of agencies to find and formulate policies that can be\njustified by neutral principles and a reasoned explanation.\nTo achieve that end, Congress confined agencies\u2019 discre\u00ad\ntion and subjected their decisions to judicial review. See\nR. Stewart & C. Sunstein, Public Programs and Private\nRights, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1193, 1248 (1982) (the APA was a\n\u201cworking compromise, in which broad delegations of dis\u00ad\ncretion were tolerated as long as they were checked by\nextensive procedural safeguards\u201d). If an agency takes\naction not based on neutral and rational principles, the\nAPA grants federal courts power to set aside the agency\u2019s\naction as \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A);\nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S.\n402, 416 (1971). For these reasons, agencies under the\nAPA are subject to a \u201csearching and careful\u201d review by the\ncourts. Ibid.\n   Where there is a policy change the record may be much\nmore developed because the agency based its prior policy\non factual findings. In that instance, an agency\u2019s decision\nto change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the\nagency ignores or countermands its earlier factual find\u00ad\nings without reasoned explanation for doing so. An agency\ncannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual\ndeterminations that it made in the past, any more than it\ncan ignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank\nslate.\n   This is the principle followed in the Court\u2019s opinion in\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nFarm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29 (1983).\nThere, Congress directed the agency to issue regulations\nthat would \u201c \u2018meet the need for motor vehicle safety.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 33. The agency promulgated a regulation requiring\ncars to have passive-restraint systems\u2014either airbags or\nautomatic seatbelts. Id., at 37. The agency based this\nregulation on its factual finding that these systems save\nlives. Id., at 35.\n   Following a change in Presidential administration,\nhowever, the agency reversed course and rescinded the\nregulation. In doing so, the agency did not address its\nprior finding that airbags save lives. Id., at 47\u201348. In\u00ad\ndeed, \u201c[n]ot one sentence\u201d of the agency\u2019s \u201crulemaking\nstatement\u201d in support of rescinding the regulation dis\u00ad\ncussed the benefits of airbags. Id., at 48. This Court\nfound the agency\u2019s rescission arbitrary and capricious\nbecause the agency did not address its prior factual find\u00ad\nings. See id., at 49\u201351.\n   The present case does not raise the concerns addressed\nin State Farm. Rather than base its prior policy on its\nknowledge of the broadcast industry and its audience, the\nFCC instead based its policy on what it considered to be\nour holding in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726\n(1978). See In re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation,\n69 F. C. C. 2d 1250, 1254, \u00b610 (1978) (\u201cWe intend strictly\nto observe the narrowness of the Pacifica holding\u201d). The\nFCC did not base its prior policy on factual findings.\n   The FCC\u2019s Remand Order explains that the agency has\nchanged its reading of Pacifica. The reasons the agency\nannounces for this change are not so precise, detailed, or\nelaborate as to be a model for agency explanation. But, as\nthe opinion for the Court well explains, the FCC\u2019s reasons\nfor its action were the sort of reasons an agency may\nconsider and act upon.

Apparently assuming that the Federal Communica\u00ad\ntions Commission\u2019s (FCC or Commission) rulemaking\nauthority is a species of executive power, the Court es\u00ad\npouses the novel proposition that the Commission need\nnot explain its decision to discard a longstanding rule in\nfavor of a dramatically different approach to regulation.\nSee ante, at 10\u201311. Moreover, the Court incorrectly as\u00ad\nsumes that our decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,\n438 U. S. 726 (1978), decided that the word \u201cindecent,\u201d as\nused in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464,1 permits the FCC to punish the\nbroadcast of any expletive that has a sexual or excretory\norigin. Pacifica was not so sweeping, and the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s changed view of its statutory mandate certainly\nwould have been rejected if presented to the Court at the\ntime.\n                           I\n  \u201cThe structure of our Government as conceived by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 1464 provides: \u201cWhoever utters any obscene, indecent, or\n\nprofane language by means of radio communication shall be fined\nunder this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\u201d\n2          FCC v.

Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc.,\n501 U. S. 252, 272 (1991). The distinction among the\nbranches is not always sharp, see Bowsher v. Synar, 478\nU. S. 714, 749 (1986) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg\u00ad\nment) (citing cases), a consequence of the fact that the\n\u201cgreat ordinances of the Constitution do not establish and\ndivide fields of black and white,\u201d Springer v. Philippine\nIslands, 277 U. S. 189, 209 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting).\nStrict lines of authority are particularly elusive when\nCongress and the President both exert a measure of con\u00ad\ntrol over an agency. As a landmark decision involving the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) made clear, however,\nwhen Congress grants rulemaking and adjudicative au\u00ad\nthority to an expert agency composed of commissioners\nselected through a bipartisan procedure and appointed for\nfixed terms, it substantially insulates the agency from\nexecutive control. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United\nStates, 295 U. S. 602, 623\u2013628 (1935).\n   With the view that broadcast regulation \u201cshould be as\nfree from political influence or arbitrary control as possi\u00ad\nble,\u201d S. Rep.

Just as the FCC\u2019s commissioners do not serve at the\nwill of the President, see 47 U. S. C. \u00a7154(c) (2000 ed.), its\nregulations are not subject to change at the President\u2019s\nwill. And when the Commission fashions rules that gov\u00ad\nern the airwaves, it exercises legislative power delegated\nto it by Congress. See Whitman v. American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U.

S., at 628.2\n   The FCC, like all agencies, may revise its regulations\nfrom time to time, just as Congress amends its statutes as\ncircumstances warrant. But the FCC is constrained by its\ncongressional mandate. There should be a strong pre\u00ad\nsumption that the FCC\u2019s initial views, reflecting the in\u00ad\nformed judgment of independent commissioners with\nexpertise in the regulated area, also reflect the views of\nthe Congress that delegated the Commission authority to\nflesh out details not fully defined in the enacting statute.\nThe rules adopted after Pacifica, 438 U. S. 726, have been\nin effect for decades and have not proved unworkable in\nthe intervening years. As JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s opinion\nexplains, broadcasters have a substantial interest in\nregulatory stability; the threat of crippling financial pen\u00ad\nalties looms large over these entities. See post, at 10\u201314.\nThe FCC\u2019s shifting and impermissibly vague indecency\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE  SCALIA erroneously concludes that treating the FCC\u2019s rule\u00ad\nmaking authority as an exercise of legislative power would somehow be\nunconstitutional. See ante, at 21 (citing Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S.\n714, 726 (1986)). But that is the nature of rulemaking: Rules promul\u00ad\ngated by agencies (independent or not) carry the force of law precisely\nbecause they are exercises of such legislative authority. This may\noffend JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s theory of the \u201cunitary Executive,\u201d ante, at 22,\nbut it does not offend the Constitution. Indeed, \u201cthe Framers vested\n\u2018All legislative Powers\u2019 in the Congress, Art. I, \u00a71, just as in Article II\nthey vested the \u2018executive Power\u2019 in the President, Art. II, \u00a71. Those\nprovisions do not purport to limit the authority of either recipient of\npower to delegate authority to others.\u201d Whitman v. American Trucking\nAssns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 489 (2001) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment).\n4            FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npolicy only imperils these broadcasters and muddles the\nregulatory landscape. It therefore makes eminent sense to\nrequire the Commission to justify why its prior policy is no\nlonger sound before allowing it to change course.3 The\nFCC\u2019s congressional charter, 47 U. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq., the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A) (2006\ned.) (instructing courts to \u201chold unlawful and set aside . . .\narbitrary [or] capricious\u201d agency action), and the rule of\nlaw all favor stability over administrative whim.\n                              II\n  The Court commits a second critical error by assuming\nthat Pacifica endorsed a construction of the term \u201cinde\u00ad\ncent,\u201d as used in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, that would include any\nexpletive that has a sexual or excretory origin. Neither\nthe opinion of the Court, nor Justice Powell\u2019s concurring\nopinion, adopted such a far-reaching interpretation. Our\nholding was narrow in two critical respects. First, we\nconcluded, over the dissent of four Justices, that the statu\u00ad\ntory term \u201cindecent\u201d was not limited to material that had\nprurient appeal and instead included material that was in\n\u201cnonconformance with accepted standards of morality.\u201d\nPacifica, 438 U. S., at 740. Second, we upheld the FCC\u2019s\nadjudication that a 12-minute, expletive-filled monologue\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 It appears that JUSTICE SCALIA has come to the view that isolated\n\nstatements by members of a congressional oversight subcommittee are\nsufficient evidence of Congress\u2019 intent. See ante, at 20, n. 4. Delving\ninto the details of how various lawmakers \u201cgrilled\u201d the full slate of FCC\nCommissioners, JUSTICE SCALIA concludes, quite remarkably, that this\nencounter \u201cmade clear [Congress\u2019] wishes for stricter enforcement\u201d and\n\u201cwould seem an adequate explanation of [the FCC\u2019s] change of posi\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Ante, at 21. Putting to the side the question whether congres\u00ad\nsional outrage is the kind of evidence sufficient to explain the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s decision to adopt a thinly-reasoned and unconstitutional policy,\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s treatment of these proceedings as evidencing the\nintent of Congress would make even the most ardent student of legisla\u00ad\ntive history blush.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

We did not decide whether an isolated\nexpletive could qualify as indecent. Id., at 750; id., at\n760\u2013761 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). And we certainly did not hold that any word\nwith a sexual or scatological origin, however used, was\nindecent.\n   The narrow treatment of the term \u201cindecent\u201d in Pacifica\ndefined the outer boundaries of the enforcement policies\nadopted by the FCC in the ensuing years. The Commis\u00ad\nsion originally explained that \u201cunder the legal standards\nset forth in Pacifica, deliberate and repetitive use [of\nexpletives] in a patently offensive manner is a requisite to\na finding of indecency.\u201d In re Pacifica Foundation, 2 FCC\nRcd. 2698, 2699, \u00b613 (1987). While the \u201crepetitive use\u201d\nissue has received the most attention in this case, it\nshould not be forgotten that Pacifica permitted the Com\u00ad\nmission to regulate only those words that describe sex or\nexcrement. See 438 U. S., at 743 (plurality opinion)\n(\u201c[T]he Commission\u2019s definition of indecency will deter\nonly the broadcasting of patently offensive references to\nexcretory and sexual organs and activities\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). The FCC minimizes the strength of this limita\u00ad\ntion by now claiming that any use of the words at issue in\nthis case, in any context and in any form, necessarily\ndescribes sex or excrement. See In re Complaints Regard\ning Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2,\n2002 and March 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 13299, 13308, \u00b623\n(2006) (Remand Order) (\u201c[A]ny strict dichotomy between\nexpletives and descriptions or depictions of sexual or\nexcretory functions is artificial and does not make sense in\nlight of the fact that an expletive\u2019s power to offend derives\nfrom its sexual or excretory meaning\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). The customs of speech refute this claim:\nThere is a critical distinction between the use of an exple\u00ad\ntive to describe a sexual or excretory function and the use\n6             FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof such a word for an entirely different purpose, such as to\nexpress an emotion. One rests at the core of indecency;\nthe other stands miles apart. As any golfer who has\nwatched his partner shank a short approach knows, it\nwould be absurd to accept the suggestion that the resul\u00ad\ntant four-letter word uttered on the golf course describes\nsex or excrement and is therefore indecent. But that is the\nabsurdity the FCC has embraced in its new approach to\nindecency.4 See In re Complaints Against Various Broad\ncast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \u201cGolden Globe\nAwards\u201d Program, 19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4978\u20134979, \u00b6\u00b68\u20139\n(2004) (declaring that even the use of an expletive to\nemphasize happiness \u201cinvariably invokes a coarse sexual\nimage\u201d).\n   Even if the words that concern the Court in this case\nsometimes retain their sexual or excretory meaning, there\nare surely countless instances in which they are used in a\nmanner unrelated to their origin. These words may not be\npolite, but that does not mean they are necessarily \u201cinde\u00ad\ncent\u201d under \u00a71464. By improperly equating the two, the\nCommission has adopted an interpretation of \u201cindecency\u201d\nthat bears no resemblance to what Pacifica contemplated.5\nMost distressingly, the Commission appears to be entirely\nunaware of this fact, see Remand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at\n13308 (erroneously referencing Pacifica in support of its\nnew policy), and today\u2019s majority seems untroubled by this\nsignificant oversight, see ante, at 4\u20135, 13\u201314. Because the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 It is ironic, to say the least, that while the FCC patrols the airwaves\n\nfor words that have a tenuous relationship with sex or excrement,\ncommercials broadcast during prime-time hours frequently ask viewers\nwhether they too are battling erectile dysfunction or are having trouble\ngoing to the bathroom.\n  5 While JUSTICE THOMAS and I disagree about the continued wisdom\n\nof Pacifica, see ante, p. 1 (concurring opinion), the changes in technol\u00ad\nogy and the availability of broadcast spectrum he identifies certainly\ncounsel a restrained approach to indecency regulation, not the wildly\nexpansive path the FCC has chosen.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

This appeal, I recognize, arises under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act.* JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s\ndissenting opinion, which I join, cogently describes the\ninfirmities of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s\n(FCC or Commission) policy switch under that Act. The\nCommission\u2019s bold stride beyond the bounds of FCC v.\nPacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978), I agree, exem\nplified \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201ccapricious\u201d decisionmaking. I\nwrite separately only to note that there is no way to hide\nthe long shadow the First Amendment casts over what the\nCommission has done. Today\u2019s decision does nothing to\ndiminish that shadow.\n  More than 30 years ago, a sharply divided Court allowed\nthe FCC to sanction a midafternoon radio broadcast of\ncomedian George Carlin\u2019s 12-minute \u201cFilthy Words\u201d mono\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The Second Circuit, presented with both constitutional and statu\ntory challenges, vacated the remand order on APA grounds.

Justice\nPowell, concurring, described Carlin\u2019s speech as \u201cverbal\nshock treatment.\u201d Id., at 757 (concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment).\n   In contrast, the unscripted fleeting expletives at issue\nhere are neither deliberate nor relentlessly repetitive. Nor\ndoes the Commission\u2019s policy home in on expressions used\nto describe sexual or excretory activities or organs. Spon\ntaneous utterances used simply to convey an emotion or\nintensify a statement fall within the order\u2019s compass. Cf.\nCohen v. California, 403 U.

Its\nexplanation fails to discuss two critical factors, at least\none of which directly underlay its original policy decision.\nIts explanation instead discussed several factors well\nknown to it the first time around, which by themselves\nprovide no significant justification for a change of policy.\nConsequently, the FCC decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious,\nan abuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U.

FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreasons nor to rest them primarily upon unexplained\npolicy preferences. Federal Communications Commission\u00ad\ners have fixed terms of office; they are not directly respon\u00ad\nsible to the voters; and they enjoy an independence ex\u00ad\npressly designed to insulate them, to a degree, from \u201c \u2018the\nexercise of political oversight.\u2019 \u201d Freytag v.

That insulation helps to\nsecure important governmental objectives, such as the\nconstitutionally related objective of maintaining broadcast\nregulation that does not bend too readily before the politi\u00ad\ncal winds. But that agency\u2019s comparative freedom from\nballot-box control makes it all the more important that\ncourts review its decisionmaking to assure compliance\nwith applicable provisions of the law\u2014including law re\u00ad\nquiring that major policy decisions be based upon articu\u00ad\nlable reasons.\n  The statutory provision applicable here is the Adminis\u00ad\ntrative Procedure Act\u2019s (APA) prohibition of agency action\nthat is \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,\u201d 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). This legal requirement helps assure\nagency decisionmaking based upon more than the per\u00ad\nsonal preferences of the decisionmakers. Courts have\napplied the provision sparingly, granting agencies broad\npolicymaking leeway. But they have also made clear that\nagency discretion is not \u201c \u2018unbounded.\u2019 \u201d Burlington Truck\nLines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.

NLRB,\n522 U. S. 359, 374 (1998). An agency\u2019s policy decisions\nmust reflect the reasoned exercise of expert judgment. See\nBurlington Truck Lines, supra, at 167 (decision must\nreflect basis on which agency \u201cexercised its expert discre\u00ad\ntion\u201d); see also Humphrey\u2019s Executor v.

And, as\nthis Court has specified, in determining whether an\nagency\u2019s policy choice was \u201carbitrary,\u201d a reviewing court\n\u201cmust consider whether the decision was based on a con\u00ad\nsideration of the relevant factors and whether there has\nbeen a clear error of judgment.\u201d Overton Park, supra, at\n416.\n   Moreover, an agency must act consistently. The agency\nmust follow its own rules. Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchi\nson, T. & S. F. R. Co., 284 U. S. 370, 389\u2013390 (1932). And\nwhen an agency seeks to change those rules, it must focus\non the fact of change and explain the basis for that\nchange. See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications\nAssn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981\n(2005) (\u201cUnexplained inconsistency is\u201d a \u201creason for hold\u00ad\ning an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious\nchange from agency practice\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   To explain a change requires more than setting forth\nreasons why the new policy is a good one. It also requires\nthe agency to answer the question, \u201cWhy did you change?\u201d\nAnd a rational answer to this question typically requires a\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmore complete explanation than would prove satisfactory\nwere change itself not at issue. An (imaginary) adminis\u00ad\ntrator explaining why he chose a policy that requires\ndriving on the right-side, rather than the left-side, of the\nroad might say, \u201cWell, one side seemed as good as the\nother, so I flipped a coin.\u201d But even assuming the ration\u00ad\nality of that explanation for an initial choice, that expla\u00ad\nnation is not at all rational if offered to explain why the\nadministrator changed driving practice, from right-side to\nleft-side, 25 years later.\n   In State Farm, a unanimous Court applied these com\u00ad\nmonsense requirements to an agency decision that re\u00ad\nscinded an earlier agency policy. The Court wrote that an\nagency must provide an explanation for the agency\u2019s \u201crevo\ncation\u201d of a prior action that is more thorough than the\nexplanation necessary when it does not act in the first\ninstance. The Court defined \u201crevocation,\u201d not simply as\nrescinding an earlier policy, cf. ante, at 10\u201311, but as \u201ca\nreversal of the agency\u2019s former views as to the proper\ncourse.\u201d State Farm, 463 U. S., at 41 (emphasis added).\nSee also Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S.\n467, 502, n. 20 (2002) (portion of Court\u2019s opinion joined by\nSCALIA, KENNEDY, and THOMAS, JJ.)

But see ante, at 10\u201311. It\nsaid that the law required an explanation for such a\nchange because the earlier policy, representing a \u201c \u2018settled\ncourse of behavior[,] embodies the agency\u2019s informed\njudgment that, by pursuing that course, it will carry out\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Thus, the agency must\nexplain why it has come to the conclusion that it should\nnow change direction. Why does it now reject the consid\u00ad\nerations that led it to adopt that initial policy? What has\nchanged in the world that offers justification for the\nchange? What other good reasons are there for departing\nfrom the earlier policy?\n   Contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization of this dis\u00ad\nsent, it would not (and State Farm does not) require a\n\u201cheightened standard\u201d of review. Ante, at 10 (emphasis\nadded). Rather, the law requires application of the same\nstandard of review to different circumstances, namely\ncircumstances characterized by the fact that change is at\nissue. It requires the agency to focus upon the fact of\nchange where change is relevant, just as it must focus\nupon any other relevant circumstance. It requires the\nagency here to focus upon the reasons that led the agency\nto adopt the initial policy, and to explain why it now comes\nto a new judgment.\n   I recognize that sometimes the ultimate explanation for\na change may have to be, \u201cWe now weigh the relevant\nconsiderations differently.\u201d But at other times, an agency\ncan and should say more. Where, for example, the agency\nrested its previous policy on particular factual findings,\nsee ante, at 3\u20135 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment); or where an agency rested its\nprior policy on its view of the governing law, see infra, at\n7\u201311; or where an agency rested its previous policy on,\nsay, a special need to coordinate with another agency, one\nwould normally expect the agency to focus upon those\nearlier views of fact, of law, or of policy and explain why\nthey are no longer controlling. Regardless, to say that the\nagency here must answer the question \u201cwhy change\u201d is not\nto require the agency to provide a justification that is\n\u201cbetter than the reasons for the old [policy].\u201d Ante, at 11.\n6          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nIt is only to recognize the obvious fact that change is some\u00ad\ntimes (not always) a relevant background feature that\nsometimes (not always) requires focus (upon prior justifi\u00ad\ncations) and explanation lest the adoption of the new\npolicy (in that circumstance) be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an\nabuse of discretion.\u201d\n   That is certainly how courts of appeals, the courts that\nreview agency decisions, have always treated the matter\nin practice. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Federation of Sports\nmen\u2019s Clubs, Inc. v. Kempthorne, 497 F. 3d 337, 351 (CA3\n2007); Yale-New Haven Hosp. v. Leavitt, 470 F. 3d 71, 79\n(CA2 2006); Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United\nStates, 391 F. 3d 338, 352 (CA1 2004). But see NAACP v.\nFCC, 682 F. 2d 993, 998 (CADC 1982) (using word \u201cheight\u00ad\nened\u201d). The majority\u2019s holding could in this respect sig\u00ad\nnificantly change judicial review in practice, and not in a\nhealthy direction. But see, ante, at 1\u20135 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). After all,\nif it is always legally sufficient for the agency to reply to\nthe question \u201cwhy change?\u201d with the answer \u201cwe prefer\nthe new policy\u201d (even when the agency has not considered\nthe major factors that led it to adopt its old policy), then\nwhy bother asking the agency to focus on the fact of\nchange? More to the point, why would the law exempt this\nand no other aspect of an agency decision from \u201carbitrary,\ncapricious\u201d review? Where does, and why would, the APA\ngrant agencies the freedom to change major policies on the\nbasis of nothing more than political considerations or even\npersonal whim?\n   Avoiding the application of any heightened standard of\nreview, the Court in State Farm recognized that the APA\u2019s\n\u201cnonarbitrary\u201d requirement affords agencies generous\nleeway when they set policy. 463 U. S., at 42. But it also\nrecognized that this leeway is not absolute. The Court\ndescribed its boundaries by then listing considerations\nthat help determine whether an explanation is adequate.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nMirroring and elaborating upon its statement in Overton\nPark, 401 U. S. 402, the Court said that a reviewing court\nshould take into account whether the agency had \u201crelied\non factors which Congress has not intended it to consider,\nentirely failed to consider an important aspect of the\nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs\ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implau\u00ad\nsible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or\nthe product of agency expertise.\u201d State Farm, supra, at 43;\nsee also Overton Park, supra, at 416.\n                              II\n  We here must apply the general standards set forth in\nState Farm and Overton Park to an agency decision that\nchanges a 25-year-old \u201cfleeting expletive\u201d policy from (1)\nthe old policy that would normally permit broadcasters to\ntransmit a single, fleeting use of an expletive to (2) a new\npolicy that would threaten broadcasters with large fines\nfor transmitting even a single use (including its use by a\nmember of the public) of such an expletive, alone with\nnothing more. The question is whether that decision\nsatisfies the minimal standards necessary to assure a\nreviewing court that such a change of policy is not \u201carbi\u00ad\ntrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2)(A), particularly as set forth in, e.g., State Farm\nand Overton Park, supra, at 2\u20137. The decision, in my\nview, does not satisfy those standards.\n  Consider the requirement that an agency at least mini\u00ad\nmally \u201cconsider . . . important aspect[s] of the problem.\u201d\nState Farm, supra, at 43. The FCC failed to satisfy this\nrequirement, for it failed to consider two critically impor\u00ad\ntant aspects of the problem that underlay its initial policy\njudgment (one of which directly, the other of which indi\u00ad\nrectly). First, the FCC said next to nothing about the\nrelation between the change it made in its prior \u201cfleeting\nexpletive\u201d policy and the First-Amendment-related need to\n8          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\navoid \u201ccensorship,\u201d a matter as closely related to broad\u00ad\ncasting regulation as is health to that of the environment.\nThe reason that discussion of the matter is particularly\nimportant here is that the FCC had explicitly rested its\nprior policy in large part upon the need to avoid treading\ntoo close to the constitutional line.\n    Thirty years ago, the Court considered the location of\nthat constitutional line. In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,\n438 U. S. 726 (1978), the Court reviewed an FCC decision\nforbidding the broadcast of a monologue that deliberately\nand repeatedly uttered the expletives here at issue more\nthan 100 times in one hour at a time of day when children\nwere likely to hear the broadcast. Id., at 739. The Court\nheld that the FCC\u2019s prohibition did not violate the First\nAmendment. But the Court divided 5 to 4. And two Mem\u00ad\nbers of the majority, Justices Powell and Blackmun, ex\u00ad\nplicitly noted that the Court \u201cdoes not speak to cases\ninvolving the isolated use of a potentially offensive word\n. . . as distinguished from the verbal shock treatment\nadministered by respondent here.\u201d Id., at 760\u2013761 (Pow\u00ad\nell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(emphasis added). This statement by two Members of the\nmajority suggested that they could reach a different re\u00ad\nsult, finding an FCC prohibition unconstitutional, were\nthat prohibition aimed at the fleeting or single use of an\nexpletive.\n    The FCC subsequently made clear that it thought that\nJustice Powell\u2019s concurrence set forth a constitutional line\nthat its indecency policy should embody. In 1978, the\nCommission wrote that the First Amendment \u201cseverely\nlimit[s]\u201d the Commission\u2019s role in regulating indecency. It\nadded that the Court, in Pacifica, had \u201crelied . . . on the\nrepetitive occurrence of the \u2018indecent\u2019 words in question.\u201d\nAnd it said that, in setting policy, it \u201cintend[ed] strictly to\nobserve the narrowness of the Pacifica holding.\u201d In re\nApplication of WGBH Educ.

C. C. 2d\n750, 760, \u00b6\u00b617\u201318. In 1987, the Commission once more\nexplained that its \u201cfleeting expletives\u201d policy reflected the\nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacifica. It said that, under its policy,\n\u201cspeech that is indecent must involve more than an iso\u00ad\nlated use of an offensive word,\u201d adding that \u201cwe believe\nthat under the legal standards set forth in Pacifica, delib\u00ad\nerate and repetitive use in a patently offensive manner is\na requisite to a finding of indecency.\u201d In re Pacifica Foun\ndation, 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699, \u00b613 (emphasis added). In\nanother order that same year, the Commission stated that\n\u201cthe First Amendment dicate[s] a careful and restrained\napproach with regard to review of matters involving\nbroadcast programming\u201d; it then explained, citing\nPacifica, that \u201c[s]peech that is indecent must involve more\nthan the isolated use of an offensive word.\u201d In re Infinity\nBroadcasting, 2 FCC Rcd. 2705, 2705, \u00b6\u00b66\u20137 (1987) (em\u00ad\nphasis added). And in 2001, in giving the industry guid\u00ad\nance, the FCC once again said in respect to its regulation\nof indecent speech that it \u201cmust both identify a compelling\ninterest for any regulation . . . and choose the least restric\u00ad\ntive means to further that interest.\u201d In re Industry Guid\nance On Commission\u2019s Case Law Interpreting 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast\nIndecency, 16 FCC Rcd. 7999, 8000\u20138001, \u00b63\u20135.\n   The FCC thus repeatedly made clear that it based its\n\u201cfleeting expletive\u201d policy upon the need to avoid treading\ntoo close to the constitutional line as set forth in Justice\nPowell\u2019s Pacifica concurrence. What then did it say, when\n10         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nit changed its policy, about why it abandoned this Consti\u00ad\ntution-based reasoning? The FCC devoted \u201cfour full pages\nof small-type, single-spaced text,\u201d ante, at 23, responding\nto industry arguments that, e.g., changes in the nature of\nthe broadcast industry made all indecency regulation, i.e.,\n18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, unconstitutional. In doing so it repeat\u00ad\nedly reaffirmed its view that Pacifica remains good law.\nIn re Complaints Regarding Various Television Broadcasts\nBetween February 2, 2002, and March, 8, 2008, 21 FCC\nRcd. 13299, 13317\u201313321, \u00b6\u00b642\u201352 (2006) (Remand Or\nder). All the more surprising then that, in respect to why\nit abandoned its prior view about the critical relation\nbetween its prior fleeting expletive policy and Justice\nPowell\u2019s Pacifica concurrence, it says no more than the\nfollowing:\n   \u201c[O]ur decision is not inconsistent with the Supreme\nCourt ruling in Pacifica. The Court explicitly left open the\nissue of whether an occasional expletive could be consid\u00ad\nered indecent.\u201d In re Complaints Against Various Broad\ncast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \u201cGolden Globe\nAwards\u201d Program, 19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4982, \u00b616 (2004)\n(Golden Globe Order). And, (repeating what it already\nhad said), \u201c[Pacifica] specifically reserved the question of\n\u2018an occasional expletive\u2019 and noted that it addressed only\nthe \u2018particular broadcast\u2019 at issue in that case.\u201d Remand\nOrder, supra, at 13308\u201313309, \u00b624.\n   These two sentences are not a summary of the FCC\u2019s\ndiscussion about why it abandoned its prior understanding\nof Pacifica.

The result is not simply Hamlet\nwithout the prince, but Hamlet with a prince who, in mid\u00ad\nplay and without explanation, just disappears.\n    I have found one other related reference to Pacifica, but\nthat reference occurs in an opinion written by a dissenting\nCommissioner. That dissenter said that the FCC had\n\u201c \u2018fail[ed] to address the many serious [constitutional]\nconcerns raised\u2019 \u201d by the new policy, while adding that the\nnew policy was \u201cnot the restrained enforcement policy\nencouraged by the Supreme Court in Pacifica.\u201d Remand\nOrder, supra, at 13331, 13334. Neither that Commis\u00ad\nsioner in his dissent, nor I in this dissent, claim that\nagencies must always take account of possible constitu\u00ad\ntional issues when they formulate policy. Cf. ante, at 12.\nBut the FCC works in the shadow of the First Amendment\nand its view of the application of that Amendment to\n\u201cfleeting expletives\u201d directly informed its initial policy\nchoice. Under these circumstances, the FCC\u2019s failure to\naddress this \u201caspect\u201d of the problem calls for a remand to\nthe agency. Overton Park, 401 U. S., at 420\u2013421.\n    Second, the FCC failed to consider the potential impact\nof its new policy upon local broadcasting coverage. This\n\u201caspect of the problem\u201d is particularly important because\nthe FCC explicitly took account of potential broadcasting\nimpact. Golden Globe Order, supra, at 4980, \u00b611 (\u201cThe\nease with which broadcasters today can block even fleeting\nwords in a live broadcast is an element in our decision\u201d).\nIndeed, in setting forth \u201cbleeping\u201d technology changes\n(presumably lowering bleeping costs) as justifying the\npolicy change, it implicitly reasoned that lower costs,\nmaking it easier for broadcasters to install bleeping\nequipment, made it less likely that the new policy would\nlead broadcasters to reduce coverage, say by canceling\ncoverage of public events. Ibid. (\u201c[T]echnological advances\n12         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave made it possible . . . to prevent the broadcast of a\nsingle offending word or action without blocking or dispro\u00ad\nportionately disrupting the message of the speaker or\nperformer\u201d).\n    What then did the FCC say about the likelihood that\nsmaller independent broadcasters, including many public\nservice broadcasters, still would not be able to afford\n\u201cbleeping\u201d technology and, as a consequence, would reduce\nlocal coverage, indeed cancel coverage, of many public\nevents? It said nothing at all.\n    The FCC cannot claim that local coverage lacks special\nimportance. To the contrary, \u201cthe concept of localism has\nbeen a cornerstone of broadcast regulation for decades.\u201d\nIn re Broadcast Localism, 23 FCC Rcd. 1324, 1326, 1327,\n\u00b6\u00b63, 5 (2008). That policy seeks to provide \u201cviewers and\nlisteners . . . access to locally responsive programming\nincluding, but not limited to, local news and public affairs\nmatter\u201d and to ensure \u201cdiversity in what is seen and heard\nover the airwaves.\u201d That policy has long favored local\nbroadcasting, both as a means to increase coverage of local\nevents and, insofar as it increases the number of broadcast\nvoices, as an end in itself. See, e.g., In re Reexamination of\nComparative Standards for Noncommercial Educ.

Ante, at 24\u201325.\nThe plurality's \u201cdoubt[s]\u201d rest upon its views (1) that\nvulgar expression is less prevalent (at least among broad\u00ad\ncast guests) in smaller towns, ante, at 24; (2) that the\ngreatest risk the new policy poses for \u201csmall-town broad\u00ad\ncasters\u201d arises when they broadcast local \u201cnews and public\naffairs,\u201d ibid., and (3) that the Remand Order says \u201clittle\nabout how the Commission would treat smaller broadcast\u00ad\ners who cannot afford screening equipment,\u201d while also\npointing out that the new policy \u201c \u2018does not . . . impose\nundue burdens on broadcasters\u2019 \u201d and emphasizing that\nthe case before it did not involve \u201c \u2018breaking news.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 24\u201325.\n   As to the first point, about the prevalence of vulgarity in\nsmall towns, I confess ignorance. But I do know that there\nare independent stations in many large and medium sized\ncities. See Television & Cable Factbook, Directory of\nTelevision Stations in Operation 2008. As to the second\npoint, I too believe that coverage of local public events, if\nnot news, lies at the heart of the problem.\n   I cannot agree with the plurality, however, about the\ncritical third point, namely that the new policy obviously\nprovides smaller independent broadcasters with adequate\nassurance that they will not be fined. The new policy\nremoves the \u201cfleeting expletive\u201d exception, an exception\nthat assured smaller independent stations that they would\nnot be fined should someone swear at a public event. In\nits place, it puts a policy that places all broadcasters at\nrisk when they broadcast fleeting expletives, including\nexpletives uttered at public events.

It does list those circumstances as\nincluding the \u201cpossibility of human error in using delay\nequipment.\u201d Id., at 13313, \u00b635. But it says nothing about\na station\u2019s inability to afford delay equipment (a matter\nthat in individual cases could itself prove debatable). All\nthe FCC had to do was to consider this matter and either\ngrant an exemption or explain why it did not grant an\nexemption. But it did not. And the result is a rule that\nmay well chill coverage\u2014the kind of consequence that the\nlaw has considered important for decades, to which the\nbroadcasters pointed in their arguments before the FCC,\nand which the FCC nowhere discusses. See, e.g., Dom\nbrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 494 (1965) (\u201cSo long as\nthe statute remains available to the State the threat of\nprosecutions of protected expression is a real and substan\u00ad\ntial one.

The agency\u2019s failure to discuss these two \u201cimportant\naspect[s] of the problem\u201d means that the resulting decision\nis \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d requiring\nus to remand the matter to the agency. State Farm, 463\nU. S., at 43; Overton Park, 401 U. S., at 416.\n                              III\n   The three reasons the FCC did set forth in support of its\nchange of policy cannot make up for the failures I have\ndiscussed. Consider each of them. First, as I have pointed\nout, the FCC based its decision in part upon the fact that\n\u201cbleeping/delay systems\u201d technology has advanced. I have\nalready set forth my reasons for believing that that fact,\nwithout more, cannot provide a sufficient justification for\nits policy change. Supra, at 11\u201316.\n   Second, the FCC says that the expletives here in ques\u00ad\ntion always invoke a coarse excretory or sexual image;\nhence it makes no sense to distinguish between whether\none uses the relevant terms as an expletive or as a literal\ndescription. The problem with this answer is that it does\nnot help to justify the change in policy. The FCC was\naware of the coarseness of the \u201cimage\u201d the first time\naround. See, e.g., Remand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308,\n\u00b623 (asserting that FCC has always understood the words\nas coarse and indecent). And it explained the first time\naround why it nonetheless distinguished between their\nliteral use and their use as fleeting expletives. See, e.g., In\nre Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation, 69 F. C. C. 2d,\nat 1254\u20131255, \u00b6\u00b610\u201311 (discussing First Amendment\nconsiderations and related need to avoid reduced broad\u00ad\ncast coverage). Simply to announce that the words,\nwhether used descriptively or as expletives, call forth\nsimilar \u201cimages\u201d is not to address those reasons.\n   Third, the FCC said that \u201cperhaps\u201d its \u201cmost impor\u00ad\n18         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntan[t]\u201d justification for the new policy lay in the fact that\nits new \u201ccontextual\u201d approach to fleeting expletives is\nbetter and more \u201c[c]onsistent with\u201d the agency\u2019s \u201cgeneral\napproach to indecency\u201d than was its previous \u201ccate\u00ad\ngorica[l]\u201d approach, which offered broadcasters virtual\nimmunity for the broadcast of fleeting expletives. Remand\nOrder, supra, at 13308, \u00b623. This justification, however,\noffers no support for the change without an understanding\nof why, i.e., in what way, the FCC considered the new\napproach better or more consistent with the agency\u2019s\ngeneral approach.\n   The Solicitor General sets forth one way in which the\nnew policy might be more consistent with statutory policy.\nThe indecency statute prohibits the broadcast of \u201cany . . .\nindecent . . . language.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464. The very point\nof the statute, he says, is to eliminate nuisance; and the\nuse of expletives, even once, can constitute such a nui\u00ad\nsance. The Solicitor General adds that the statutory word\n\u201cany\u201d indicates that Congress did not intend a safe-harbor\nfor a fleeting use of that language. Brief for Petitioners\n24\u201325. The fatal flaw in this argument, however, lies in\nthe fact that the Solicitor General and not the agency has\nmade it. We must consider the lawfulness of an agency\u2019s\ndecision on the basis of the reasons the agency gave, not\non the basis of those it might have given. SEC v. Chenery\nCorp., 332 U. S. 194, 196\u2013197 (1947); State Farm, supra,\nat 50. And the FCC did not make this claim. Hence, we\ncannot take it into account and need not evaluate its\nmerits.\n   In fact, the FCC found that the new policy was better in\npart because, in its view, the new policy better protects\nchildren against what it described as \u201c \u2018the first blow\u2019 \u201d of\nbroadcast indecency that results from the \u201c \u2018pervasive\u2019 \u201d\nnature of broadcast media. It wrote that its former policy\nof \u201cgranting an automatic exemption for \u2018isolated or fleet\u00ad\ning\u2019 expletives unfairly forces viewers (including children)\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto take \u2018the first blow.\u2019 \u201d Remand Order, supra, at 13309,\n\u00b625.\n   The difficulty with this argument, however, is that it\ndoes not explain the change. The FCC has long used the\ntheory of the \u201cfirst blow\u201d to justify its regulation of broad\u00ad\ncast indecency. See, e.g., In re Enforcement of Prohibitions\nAgainst Broadcast Indecency in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, 5 FCC\nRcd. 5297, 5302, \u00b6\u00b634\u201335 (1990). Yet the FCC has also\nlong followed its original \u201cfleeting expletives\u201d policy. Nor\nwas the FCC ever unaware of the fact to which the major\u00ad\nity points, namely that children\u2019s surroundings influence\ntheir behavior. See, e.g., In re Enforcement of Prohibitions\nAgainst Broadcast Indecency in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, 8 FCC\nRcd. 704, 706, \u00b611 (1993). So, to repeat the question:\nWhat, in respect to the \u201cfirst blow,\u201d has changed?\n   The FCC points to no empirical (or other) evidence to\ndemonstrate that it previously understated the impor\u00ad\ntance of avoiding the \u201cfirst blow.\u201d Like the majority, I do\nnot believe that an agency must always conduct full em\u00ad\npirical studies of such matters. Ante, at 15\u201316. But the\nFCC could have referred to, and explained, relevant em\u00ad\npirical studies that suggest the contrary. One review of\nthe empirical evidence, for example, reports that \u201c[i]t is\ndoubtful that children under the age of 12 understand\nsexual language and innuendo; therefore it is unlikely that\nvulgarities have any negative effect.\u201d Kaye & Sapolsky,\nWatch Your Mouth! An Analysis of Profanity Uttered by\nChildren on Prime-Time Television, 2004 Mass Communi\u00ad\ncation & Soc\u2019y 429, 433 (Vol. 7) (citing two studies). The\nCommission need not have accepted this conclusion. But\nits failure to discuss this or any other such evidence, while\nproviding no empirical evidence at all that favors its posi\u00ad\ntion, must weaken the logical force of its conclusion. See\nState Farm, 463 U. S., at 43 (explaining that an agency\u2019s\nfailure to \u201cexamine the relevant data\u201d is a factor in deter\u00ad\nmining whether the decision is \u201carbitrary\u201d).\n20         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The FCC also found the new policy better because it\nbelieved that its prior policy \u201cwould as a matter of logic\npermit broadcasters to air expletives at all hours of a day\nso long as they did so one at a time.\u201d Remand Order, 21\nFCC Rcd., at 13309, \u00b625. This statement, however, raises\nan obvious question: Did that happen? The FCC\u2019s initial\n\u201cfleeting expletives\u201d policy was in effect for 25 years. Had\nbroadcasters during those 25 years aired a series of exple\u00ad\ntives \u201cone at a time?\u201d If so, it should not be difficult to find\nevidence of that fact. But the FCC refers to none. Indeed,\nthe FCC did not even claim that a change had taken place\nin this respect. It spoke only of the pure \u201clogic\u201d of the\ninitial policy \u201cpermitting\u201d such a practice. That logic\nwould have been apparent to anyone, including the FCC,\nin 1978 when the FCC set forth its initial policy.\n   Finally, the FCC made certain statements that suggest\nit did not believe it was changing prior policy in any major\nway. It referred to that prior policy as based on \u201cstaff\nletters and dicta\u201d and it said that at least one of the in\u00ad\nstances before it (namely, the Cher broadcast) would have\nbeen actionably indecent under that prior policy. Id., at\n13306\u201313307, 13324, \u00b6\u00b620\u201321, 60. As we all agree, how\u00ad\never, in fact the FCC did change its policy in a major way.\nSee ante, at 13. To the extent that the FCC minimized\nthat fact when considering the change, it did not fully\nfocus on the fact of change. And any such failure would\nmake its decision still less supportable. See National\nCable, 545 U. S., at 981.\n                             IV\n   Were the question a closer one, the doctrine of constitu\u00ad\ntional avoidance would nonetheless lead me to remand the\ncase. See United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394,\n401 (1916) (\u201cA statute must be construed, if fairly possible,\nso as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitu\u00ad\ntional but also grave doubts upon that score\u201d (emphasis\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nadded)). That doctrine seeks to avoid unnecessary judicial\nconsideration of constitutional questions, assumes that\nCongress, no less than the Judicial Branch, seeks to act\nwithin constitutional bounds, and thereby diminishes the\nfriction between the branches that judicial holdings of\nunconstitutionality might otherwise generate. See Al\nmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 237\u2013238\n(1998); see also Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.\nv. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 172\u2013173 (2001);\nEdward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building\n& Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988); Res\ncue Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, 331 U. S. 549,\n571 (1947); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 345\u2013348\n(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). The doctrine assumes\nthat Congress would prefer a less-than-optimal interpreta\u00ad\ntion of its statute to the grave risk of a constitutional\nholding that would set the statute entirely aside. See\nAlmendarez-Torres, supra, at 238 (construction of statute\nthat avoids invalidation best reflects congressional will);\ncf. United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 249, 267 (2005).\n   Unlike the majority, I can find no convincing reason for\nrefusing to apply a similar doctrine here. The Court has\noften applied that doctrine where an agency\u2019s regulation\nrelies on a plausible but constitutionally suspect interpre\u00ad\ntation of a statute. See, e.g., Solid Waste Agency, supra, at\n172\u2013174; NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S.\n490, 506\u2013507 (1979). The values the doctrine serves apply\nwhether the agency\u2019s decision does, or does not, rest upon\na constitutionally suspect interpretation of a statute. And\na remand here would do no more than ask the agency to\nreconsider its policy decision in light of the concerns raised\nin a judicial opinion. Cf. Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S.\n448, 551 (1980) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (a holding that a\ncongressional action implicating the Equal Protection\nClause \u201cwas not adequately preceded by a consideration of\nless drastic alternatives or adequately explained by a\n22         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstatement of legislative purpose would be far less intru\u00ad\nsive than a final determination that the substance of\u201d that\naction was unconstitutional). I would not now foreclose, as\nthe majority forecloses, our further consideration of this\nmatter. (Of course, nothing in the Court\u2019s decision today\nprevents the Commission from reconsidering its current\npolicy in light of potential constitutional considerations or\nfor other reasons.)\n                              V\n   In sum, the FCC\u2019s explanation of its change leaves out\ntwo critically important matters underlying its earlier\npolicy, namely Pacifica and local broadcasting coverage.\nIts explanation rests upon three considerations previously\nknown to the agency (\u201ccoarseness,\u201d the \u201cfirst blow,\u201d and\nrunning single expletives all day, one at a time). With one\nexception, it provides no empirical or other information\nexplaining why those considerations, which did not justify\nits new policy before, justify it now. Its discussion of the\none exception (technological advances in bleeping/delay\nsystems), failing to take account of local broadcast cover\u00ad\nage, is seriously incomplete.\n   I need not decide whether one or two of these features,\nstanding alone, would require us to remand the case.\nHere all come together. And taken together they suggest\nthat the FCC\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cWhy change?\u201d is,\n\u201cWe like the new policy better.\u201d This kind of answer,\nmight be perfectly satisfactory were it given by an elected\nofficial. But when given by an agency, in respect to a\nmajor change of an important policy where much more\nmight be said, it is not sufficient. State Farm, 463 U.

Argued November 4, 2008\u2014Decided April 28, 2009\nFederal law bans the broadcasting of \u201cany . . . indecent . . . language,\u201d\n  18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, which includes references to sexual or excretory ac\n  tivity or organs, see FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726. Hav\n  ing first defined the prohibited speech in 1975, the Federal Commu\n  nications Commission (FCC) took a cautious, but gradually\n  expanding, approach to enforcing the statutory prohibition. In 2004,\n  the FCC\u2019s Golden Globes Order declared for the first time that an ex\n  pletive (nonliteral) use of the F-Word or the S-Word could be actiona\n  bly indecent, even when the word is used only once.\n     This case concerns isolated utterances of the F- and S-Words dur\n  ing two live broadcasts aired by Fox Television Stations, Inc. In its\n  order upholding the indecency findings, the FCC, inter alia, stated\n  that the Golden Globes Order eliminated any doubt that fleeting ex\n  pletives could be actionable; declared that under the new policy, a\n  lack of repetition weighs against a finding of indecency, but is not a\n  safe harbor; and held that both broadcasts met the new test because\n  one involved a literal description of excrement and both invoked the\n  F-Word. The order did not impose sanctions for either broadcast.\n  The Second Circuit set aside the agency action, declining to address\n  the constitutionality of the FCC\u2019s action but finding the FCC\u2019s rea\n  soning inadequate under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n489 F. 3d 444, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\n  III\u2013E, concluding:\n    1. The FCC\u2019s orders are neither \u201carbitrary\u201d nor \u201ccapricious\u201d within\n2              FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the meaning of the APA, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). Pp. 9\u201319.\n         (a) Under the APA standard, an agency must \u201cexamine the rele\n    vant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.\u201d\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut.\n    Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 43. In overturning the FCC\u2019s\n    judgment, the Second Circuit relied in part on its precedent inter\n    preting the APA and State Farm to require a more substantial expla\n    nation for agency action that changes prior policy. There is, however,\n    no basis in the Act or this Court\u2019s opinions for a requirement that all\n    agency change be subjected to more searching review. Although an\n    agency must ordinarily display awareness that it is changing posi\n    tion, see United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 696, and may some\n    times need to account for prior factfinding or certain reliance inter\n    ests created by a prior policy, it need not demonstrate to a court\u2019s\n    satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are better than the\n    reasons for the old one. It suffices that the new policy is permissible\n    under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the\n    agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change adequately\n    indicates. Pp. 9\u201312.\n         (b) Under these standards, the FCC\u2019s new policy and its order\n    finding the broadcasts at issue actionably indecent were neither arbi\n    trary nor capricious. First, the FCC forthrightly acknowledged that\n    its recent actions have broken new ground, taking account of incon\n    sistent prior FCC and staff actions, and explicitly disavowing them as\n    no longer good law. The agency\u2019s reasons for expanding its enforce\n    ment activity, moreover, were entirely rational. Even when used as\n    an expletive, the F-Word\u2019s power to insult and offend derives from its\n    sexual meaning. And the decision to look at the patent offensiveness\n    of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with Pacifica\u2019s\n    context-based approach. Because the FCC\u2019s prior safe-harbor-for\n    single-words approach would likely lead to more widespread use, and\n    in light of technological advances reducing the costs of bleeping of\n    fending words, it was rational for the agency to step away from its old\n    regime. The FCC\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions precludes any\n    argument that it is arbitrarily punishing parties without notice of\n    their actions\u2019 potential consequences. Pp. 13\u201315.\n         (c) None of the Second Circuit\u2019s grounds for finding the FCC\u2019s ac\n    tion arbitrary and capricious is valid. First, the FCC did not need\n    empirical evidence proving that fleeting expletives constitute harmful\n    \u201cfirst blows\u201d to children; it suffices to know that children mimic be\n    havior they observe. Second, the court of appeals\u2019 finding that fidel\n    ity to the FCC\u2019s \u201cfirst blow\u201d theory would require a categorical ban on\n    all broadcasts of expletives is not responsive to the actual policy un\n    der review since the FCC has always evaluated the patent offensive\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  ness of words and statements in relation to the context in which they\n  were broadcast. The FCC\u2019s decision to retain some discretion in less\n  egregious cases does not invalidate its regulation of the broadcasts\n  under review. Third, the FCC\u2019s prediction that a per se exemption for\n  fleeting expletives would lead to their increased use merits deference\n  and makes entire sense. Pp. 15\u201318.\n        (d) Fox\u2019s additional arguments are not tenable grounds for affir\n  mance. Fox misconstrues the agency\u2019s orders when it argues that\n  that the new policy is a presumption of indecency for certain words.\n  It reads more into Pacifica than is there by arguing that the FCC\n  failed adequately to explain how this regulation is consistent with\n  that case. And Fox\u2019s argument that the FCC\u2019s repeated appeal to\n  \u201ccontext\u201d is a smokescreen for a standardless regime of unbridled dis\n  cretion ignores the fact that the opinion in Pacifica endorsed a con\n  text-based approach.

S. C. \u00a71464, which includes\nexpletives referring to sexual or excretory activity or\norgans, see FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726\n(1978). This case concerns the adequacy of the Federal\nCommunications Commission\u2019s explanation of its decision\nthat this sometimes forbids the broadcasting of indecent\nexpletives even when the offensive words are not repeated.\n          I. Statutory and Regulatory Background\n   The Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, 47\nU. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), established a\nsystem of limited-term broadcast licenses subject to vari\u00ad\nous \u201cconditions\u201d designed \u201cto maintain the control of the\nUnited States over all the channels of radio transmission,\u201d\n\u00a7301 (2000 ed.). Twenty-seven years ago we said that \u201c[a]\nlicensed broadcaster is granted the free and exclusive use\nof a limited and valuable part of the public domain; when\nhe accepts that franchise it is burdened by enforceable\n2            FCC v.

S. C. \u00a7303.1 Congress has given the Commission vari\u00ad\nous means of enforcing the indecency ban, including civil\nfines, see \u00a7503(b)(1), and license revocations or the denial\nof license renewals, see \u00a7\u00a7309(k), 312(a)(6).\n   The Commission first invoked the statutory ban on\nindecent broadcasts in 1975, declaring a daytime broad\u00ad\ncast of George Carlin\u2019s \u201cFilthy Words\u201d monologue\nactionably indecent. Pacifica Foundation, 56 F. C. C. 2d\n94. At that time, the Commission announced the defini\u00ad\ntion of indecent speech that it uses to this day, prohibiting\n\u201clanguage that describes, in terms patently offensive as\nmeasured by contemporary community standards for the\nbroadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or or\u00ad\ngans, at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk\nthat children may be in the audience.\u201d Id., at 98.\n   In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, supra, we upheld the\nCommission\u2019s order against statutory and constitutional\nchallenge. We rejected the broadcasters\u2019 argument that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The statutory prohibition applicable to commercial radio and televi\u00ad\n\nsion stations extends by its terms from 6 a.m. to 12 midnight. The\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held, however,\nthat because \u201cCongress and the Commission [had] backed away from\nthe consequences of their own reasoning,\u201d by allowing some public\nbroadcasters to air indecent speech after 10 p.m., the court was forced\n\u201cto hold that the section is unconstitutional insofar as it bars the\nbroadcasting of indecent speech between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and\nmidnight.\u201d Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, 58 F. 3d 654, 669\n(1995) (en banc), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1043 (1996).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statutory proscription applied only to speech appealing\nto the prurient interest, noting that \u201cthe normal definition\nof \u2018indecent\u2019 merely refers to nonconformance with ac\u00ad\ncepted standards of morality.\u201d Id., at 740. And we held\nthat the First Amendment allowed Carlin\u2019s monologue to\nbe banned in light of the \u201cuniquely pervasive presence\u201d of\nthe medium and the fact that broadcast programming is\n\u201cuniquely accessible to children.\u201d Id., at 748\u2013749.\n   In the ensuing years, the Commission took a cautious,\nbut gradually expanding, approach to enforcing the statu\u00ad\ntory prohibition against indecent broadcasts. Shortly after\nPacifica, 438 U. S. 726, the Commission expressed its\n\u201cinten[tion] strictly to observe the narrowness of the\nPacifica holding,\u201d which \u201crelied in part on the repetitive\noccurrence of the \u2018indecent\u2019 words\u201d contained in Carlin\u2019s\nmonologue. In re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation,\n69 F. C. C. 2d 1250, 1254, \u00b610 (1978). When the full Com\u00ad\nmission next considered its indecency standard, however,\nit repudiated the view that its enforcement power was\nlimited to \u201cdeliberate, repetitive use of the seven words\nactually contained in the George Carlin monologue.\u201d In re\nPacifica Foundation, Inc., 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699, \u00b612\n(1987). The Commission determined that such a \u201chighly\nrestricted enforcement standard . . . was unduly narrow as\na matter of law and inconsistent with [the Commission\u2019s]\nenforcement responsibilities under Section 1464.\u201d In re\nInfinity Broadcasting Corp. of Pa., 3 FCC Rcd. 930, \u00b65\n(1987). The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit upheld this expanded enforcement standard\nagainst constitutional and Administrative Procedure Act\nchallenge. See Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC,\n852 F. 2d 1332 (1988) (R. Ginsburg, J.), superseded in part\nby Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, 58 F. 3d 654\n(1995) (en banc).\n   Although the Commission had expanded its enforcement\nbeyond the \u201crepetitive use of specific words or phrases,\u201d it\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreserved a distinction between literal and nonliteral (or\n\u201cexpletive\u201d) uses of evocative language. In re Pacifica\nFoundation, Inc., 2 FCC Rcd., at 2699, \u00b613. The Commis\u00ad\nsion explained that each literal \u201cdescription or depiction of\nsexual or excretory functions must be examined in context\nto determine whether it is patently offensive,\u201d but that\n\u201cdeliberate and repetitive use . . . is a requisite to a finding\nof indecency\u201d when a complaint focuses solely on the use of\nnonliteral expletives. Ibid.\n   Over a decade later, the Commission emphasized that\nthe \u201cfull context\u201d in which particular materials appear is\n\u201ccritically important,\u201d but that a few \u201cprincipal\u201d factors\nguide the inquiry, such as the \u201cexplicitness or graphic\nnature\u201d of the material, the extent to which the material\n\u201cdwells on or repeats\u201d the offensive material, and the\nextent to which the material was presented to \u201cpander,\u201d to\n\u201ctitillate,\u201d or to \u201cshock.\u201d In re Industry Guidance On the\nCommission\u2019s Case Law Interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464\nand Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency,\n16 FCC Rcd. 7999, 8002, \u00b69, 8003, \u00b610 (2001) (emphasis\ndeleted). \u201cNo single factor,\u201d the Commission said, \u201cgener\u00ad\nally provides the basis for an indecency finding,\u201d but\n\u201cwhere sexual or excretory references have been made\nonce or have been passing or fleeting in nature, this char\u00ad\nacteristic has tended to weigh against a finding of inde\u00ad\ncency.\u201d Id., at 8003, \u00b610, 8008, \u00b617.\n   In 2004, the Commission took one step further by de\u00ad\nclaring for the first time that a nonliteral (expletive) use of\nthe F- and S-Words could be actionably indecent, even\nwhen the word is used only once. The first order to this\neffect dealt with an NBC broadcast of the Golden Globe\nAwards, in which the performer Bono commented, \u201c \u2018This\nis really, really, f***ing brilliant.\u2019 \u201d In re Complaints\nAgainst Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their\nAiring of the \u201cGolden Globe Awards\u201d Program, 19 FCC\nRcd. 4975, 4976, n. 4 (2004) (Golden Globes Order).

S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthough the Commission had received numerous com\u00ad\nplaints directed at the broadcast, its enforcement bureau\nhad concluded that the material was not indecent because\n\u201cBono did not describe, in context, sexual or excretory\norgans or activities and . . . the utterance was fleeting and\nisolated.\u201d Id., at 4975\u20134976, \u00b63. The full Commission\nreviewed and reversed the staff ruling.\n   The Commission first declared that Bono\u2019s use of the F-\nWord fell within its indecency definition, even though the\nword was used as an intensifier rather than a literal\ndescriptor. \u201c[G]iven the core meaning of the \u2018F-Word,\u2019 \u201d it\nsaid, \u201cany use of that word . . . inherently has a sexual\nconnotation.\u201d Id., at 4978, \u00b68. The Commission deter\u00ad\nmined, moreover, that the broadcast was \u201cpatently offen\u00ad\nsive\u201d because the F-Word \u201cis one of the most vulgar,\ngraphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the\nEnglish language,\u201d because \u201c[i]ts use invariably invokes a\ncoarse sexual image,\u201d and because Bono\u2019s use of the word\nwas entirely \u201cshocking and gratuitous.\u201d Id., at 4979, \u00b69.\n   The Commission observed that categorically exempting\nsuch language from enforcement actions would \u201clikely lead\nto more widespread use.\u201d Ibid. Commission action was\nnecessary to \u201csafeguard the well-being of the nation\u2019s\nchildren from the most objectionable, most offensive lan\u00ad\nguage.\u201d Ibid. The order noted that technological advances\nhave made it far easier to delete (\u201cbleep out\u201d) a \u201csingle and\ngratuitous use of a vulgar expletive,\u201d without adulterating\nthe content of a broadcast. Id., at 4980, \u00b611.\n   The order acknowledged that \u201cprior Commission and\nstaff action have indicated that isolated or fleeting broad\u00ad\ncasts of the \u2018F-Word\u2019 . . . are not indecent or would not be\nacted upon.\u201d It explicitly ruled that \u201cany such interpreta\u00ad\ntion is no longer good law.\u201d Ibid., \u00b612. It \u201cclarif[ied] . . .\nthat the mere fact that specific words or phrases are not\nsustained or repeated does not mandate a finding that\nmaterial that is otherwise patently offensive to the broad\u00ad\n6          FCC v.

The Present Case\n   This case concerns utterances in two live broadcasts\naired by Fox Television Stations, Inc., and its affiliates\nprior to the Commission\u2019s Golden Globes Order. The first\noccurred during the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, when\nthe singer Cher exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve also had critics for the\nlast 40 years saying that I was on my way out every year.\nRight. So f*** \u2018em.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 9. The second\ninvolved a segment of the 2003 Billboard Music Awards,\nduring the presentation of an award by Nicole Richie and\nParis Hilton, principals in a Fox television series called\n\u201cThe Simple Life.\u201d Ms. Hilton began their interchange by\nreminding Ms. Richie to \u201cwatch the bad language,\u201d but\nMs. Richie proceeded to ask the audience, \u201cWhy do they\neven call it \u2018The Simple Life?\u2019 Have you ever tried to get\ncow s*** out of a Prada purse? It\u2019s not so f***ing simple.\u201d\nId., at 9\u201310. Following each of these broadcasts, the Com\u00ad\nmission received numerous complaints from parents\nwhose children were exposed to the language.\n   On March 15, 2006, the Commission released Notices of\nApparent Liability for a number of broadcasts that the\nCommission deemed actionably indecent, including the\ntwo described above. In re Complaints Regarding Various\nTelevision Broadcasts Between February 2, 2002 and\nMarch 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 2664 (2006). Multiple parties\npetitioned the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for\njudicial review of the order, asserting a variety of constitu\u00ad\ntional and statutory challenges. Since the order had\ndeclined to impose sanctions, the Commission had not\npreviously given the broadcasters an opportunity to re\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspond to the indecency charges. It therefore requested\nand obtained from the Court of Appeals a voluntary re\u00ad\nmand so that the parties could air their objections. 489\nF. 3d 444, 453 (2007). The Commission\u2019s order on remand\nupheld the indecency findings for the broadcasts described\nabove. See In re Complaints Regarding Various Television\nBroadcasts Between February 2, 2002, and March 8, 2005,\n21 FCC Rcd. 13299 (2006) (Remand Order).\n   The order first explained that both broadcasts fell com\u00ad\nfortably within the subject-matter scope of the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s indecency test because the 2003 broadcast involved\na literal description of excrement and both broadcasts\ninvoked the \u201cF-Word,\u201d which inherently has a sexual\nconnotation. Id., at 13304, \u00b616, 13323, \u00b658. The order\nnext determined that the broadcasts were patently offen\u00ad\nsive under community standards for the medium. Both\nbroadcasts, it noted, involved entirely gratuitous uses of\n\u201cone of the most vulgar, graphic, and explicit words for\nsexual activity in the English language.\u201d Id., at 13305,\n\u00b617, 13324, \u00b659. It found Ms. Richie\u2019s use of the \u201cF-Word\u201d\nand her \u201cexplicit description of the handling of excrement\u201d\nto be \u201cvulgar and shocking,\u201d as well as to constitute \u201cpan\u00ad\ndering,\u201d after Ms. Hilton had playfully warned her to\n\u201c \u2018watch the bad language.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 13305, \u00b617. And it\nfound Cher\u2019s statement patently offensive in part because\nshe metaphorically suggested a sexual act as a means of\nexpressing hostility to her critics. Id., at 13324, \u00b660. The\norder relied upon the \u201ccritically important\u201d context of the\nutterances, id., at 13304, \u00b615, noting that they were aired\nduring prime-time awards shows \u201cdesigned to draw a\nlarge nationwide audience that could be expected to in\u00ad\nclude many children interested in seeing their favorite\nmusic stars,\u201d id., at 13305, \u00b618, 13324, \u00b659. Indeed, ap\u00ad\nproximately 2.5 million minors witnessed each of the\nbroadcasts. Id., at 13306, \u00b618, 13326, \u00b665.\n   The order asserted that both broadcasts under review\n8          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould have been actionably indecent under the staff rul\u00ad\nings and Commission dicta in effect prior to the Golden\nGlobes Order\u2014the 2003 broadcast because it involved a\nliteral description of excrement, rather than a mere exple\u00ad\ntive, because it used more than one offensive word, and\nbecause it was planned, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, \u00b622; and\nthe 2002 broadcast because Cher used the F-Word not as a\nmere intensifier, but as a description of the sexual act to\nexpress hostility to her critics, id., at 13324, \u00b660. The\norder stated, however, that the pre-Golden Globes regime\nof immunity for isolated indecent expletives rested only\nupon staff rulings and Commission dicta, and that the\nCommission itself had never held \u201cthat the isolated use of\nan expletive . . . was not indecent or could not be inde\u00ad\ncent,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, \u00b621. In any event, the order\nmade clear, the Golden Globes Order eliminated any doubt\nthat fleeting expletives could be actionably indecent, 21\nFCC Rcd., at 13308, \u00b623, 13325, \u00b661, and the Commission\ndisavowed the bureau-level decisions and its own dicta\nthat had said otherwise, id., at 13306\u201313307, \u00b6\u00b620, 21.\nUnder the new policy, a lack of repetition \u201cweigh[s]\nagainst a finding of indecency,\u201d id., at 13325, \u00b661, but is\nnot a safe harbor.\n   The order explained that the Commission\u2019s prior \u201cstrict\ndichotomy between \u2018expletives\u2019 and \u2018descriptions or depic\u00ad\ntions of sexual or excretory functions\u2019 is artificial and does\nnot make sense in light of the fact that an \u2018expletive\u2019s\u2019\npower to offend derives from its sexual or excretory mean\u00ad\ning.\u201d Id., at 13308, \u00b623. In the Commission\u2019s view,\n\u201cgranting an automatic exemption for \u2018isolated or fleeting\u2019\nexpletives unfairly forces viewers (including children)\u201d to\ntake \u201c \u2018the first blow\u2019 \u201d and would allow broadcasters \u201cto air\nexpletives at all hours of a day so long as they did so one\nat a time.\u201d Id., at 13309, \u00b625.

The Court of Appeals\nreversed the agency\u2019s orders, finding the Commission\u2019s\nreasoning inadequate under the Administrative Procedure\nAct. 489 F. 3d 444. The majority was \u201cskeptical that the\nCommission [could] provide a reasoned explanation for its\n\u2018fleeting expletive\u2019 regime that would pass constitutional\nmuster,\u201d but it declined to reach the constitutional ques\u00ad\ntion.

FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In overturning the Commission\u2019s judgment, the Court of\nAppeals here relied in part on Circuit precedent requiring\na more substantial explanation for agency action that\nchanges prior policy. The Second Circuit has interpreted\nthe Administrative Procedure Act and our opinion in State\nFarm as requiring agencies to make clear \u201c \u2018why the origi\u00ad\nnal reasons for adopting the [displaced] rule or policy are\nno longer dispositive\u2019 \u201d as well as \u201c \u2018why the new rule effec\u00ad\ntuates the statute as well as or better than the old rule.\u2019 \u201d\n489 F. 3d, at 456\u2013457 (quoting New York Council, Assn. of\nCivilian Technicians v. FLRA, 757 F. 2d 502, 508 (CA2\n1985); emphasis deleted). The Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit has similarly indicated that a\ncourt\u2019s standard of review is \u201cheightened somewhat\u201d when\nan agency reverses course. NAACP v. FCC, 682 F. 2d 993,\n998 (1982).\n   We find no basis in the Administrative Procedure Act or\nin our opinions for a requirement that all agency change\nbe subjected to more searching review. The Act mentions\nno such heightened standard. And our opinion in State\nFarm neither held nor implied that every agency action\nrepresenting a policy change must be justified by reasons\nmore substantial than those required to adopt a policy in\nthe first instance. That case, which involved the rescis\u00ad\nsion of a prior regulation, said only that such action re\u00ad\nquires \u201ca reasoned analysis for the change beyond that\nwhich may be required when an agency does not act in the\nfirst instance.\u201d 463 U. S., at 42 (emphasis added).2 Treat\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s contention that State Farm did anything more,\npost, at 4\u20136 (dissenting opinion), rests upon his failure to observe the\nitalicized phrase and upon a passage quoted in State Farm from a\nplurality opinion in Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade,\n412 U. S. 800 (1973). That passage referred to \u201ca presumption that\n[congressional] policies will be carried out best if the settled rule is\nadhered to.\u201d Id., at 807\u2013808 (opinion of Marshall, J.). But the Atchison\nplurality made this statement in the context of requiring the agency to\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ning failures to act and rescissions of prior action differ\u00ad\nently for purposes of the standard of review makes good\nsense, and has basis in the text of the statute, which\nlikewise treats the two separately. It instructs a review\u00ad\ning court to \u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or\nunreasonably delayed,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(1), and to \u201chold\nunlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and con\u00ad\nclusions found to be [among other things] . . . arbitrary [or]\ncapricious,\u201d \u00a7706(2)(A). The statute makes no distinction,\nhowever, between initial agency action and subsequent\nagency action undoing or revising that action.\n   To be sure, the requirement that an agency provide\nreasoned explanation for its action would ordinarily de\u00ad\nmand that it display awareness that it is changing posi\u00ad\ntion. An agency may not, for example, depart from a prior\npolicy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that are still\non the books. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683,\n696 (1974). And of course the agency must show that\nthere are good reasons for the new policy. But it need not\ndemonstrate to a court\u2019s satisfaction that the reasons for\nthe new policy are better than the reasons for the old one;\nit suffices that the new policy is permissible under the\nstatute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the\nagency believes it to be better, which the conscious change\nof course adequately indicates. This means that the\nagency need not always provide a more detailed justifica\u00ad\ntion than what would suffice for a new policy created on a\nblank slate. Sometimes it must\u2014when, for example, its\nnew policy rests upon factual findings that contradict\nthose which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprovide some explanation for a change, \u201cso that the reviewing court\nmay understand the basis of the agency\u2019s action and so may judge the\nconsistency of that action with the agency\u2019s mandate,\u201d id., at 808. The\nopinion did not assert the authority of a court to demand explanation\nsufficient to enable it to weigh (by its own lights) the merits of the\nagency\u2019s change. Nor did our opinion in State Farm.\n12            FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy has engendered serious reliance interests that must\nbe taken into account. Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota),\nN. A., 517 U. S. 735, 742 (1996). It would be arbitrary or\ncapricious to ignore such matters. In such cases it is not\nthat further justification is demanded by the mere fact of\npolicy change; but that a reasoned explanation is needed\nfor disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or\nwere engendered by the prior policy.\n   In this appeal from the Second Circuit\u2019s setting aside of\nCommission action for failure to comply with a procedural\nrequirement of the Administrative Procedure Act, the\nbroadcasters\u2019 arguments have repeatedly referred to the\nFirst Amendment. If they mean to invite us to apply a\nmore stringent arbitrary-and-capricious review to agency\nactions that implicate constitutional liberties, we reject\nthe invitation. The so-called canon of constitutional\navoidance is an interpretive tool, counseling that ambigu\u00ad\nous statutory language be construed to avoid serious\nconstitutional doubts. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v.\nFlorida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council,\n485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). We know of no precedent for\napplying it to limit the scope of authorized executive ac\u00ad\ntion. In the same section authorizing courts to set aside\n\u201carbitrary [or] capricious\u201d agency action, the Administra\u00ad\ntive Procedure Act separately provides for setting aside\nagency action that is \u201cunlawful,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A),\nwhich of course includes unconstitutional action. We\nthink that is the only context in which constitutionality\nbears upon judicial review of authorized agency action. If\nthe Commission\u2019s action here was not arbitrary or capri\u00ad\ncious in the ordinary sense, it satisfies the Administrative\nProcedure Act\u2019s \u201carbitrary [or] capricious\u201d standard; its\nlawfulness under the Constitution is a separate question\nto be addressed in a constitutional challenge.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 JUSTICE   BREYER claims that \u201c[t]he Court has often applied [the doc\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                 B. Application to This Case\n   Judged under the above described standards, the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s new enforcement policy and its order finding the\nbroadcasts actionably indecent were neither arbitrary nor\ncapricious. First, the Commission forthrightly acknowl\u00ad\nedged that its recent actions have broken new ground,\ntaking account of inconsistent \u201cprior Commission and staff\naction\u201d and explicitly disavowing them as \u201cno longer good\nlaw.\u201d Golden Globes Order, 19 FCC Rcd., at 4980, \u00b612. To\nbe sure, the (superfluous) explanation in its Remand\nOrder of why the Cher broadcast would even have violated\nits earlier policy may not be entirely convincing. But that\nunnecessary detour is irrelevant. There is no doubt that\nthe Commission knew it was making a change. That is\nwhy it declined to assess penalties; and it relied on the\nGolden Globes Order as removing any lingering doubt.\nRemand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \u00b623, 13325, \u00b661.\n   Moreover, the agency\u2019s reasons for expanding the scope\nof its enforcement activity were entirely rational. It was\ncertainly reasonable to determine that it made no sense to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntrine of constitutional avoidance] where an agency\u2019s regulation relies on\na plausible but constitutionally suspect interpretation of a statute.\u201d\nPost, at 21. The cases he cites, however, set aside an agency regulation\nbecause, applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to the am\u00ad\nbiguous statute under which the agency acted, the Court found the\nagency\u2019s interpretation of the statute erroneous. See Solid Waste\nAgency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S.\n159, 174 (2001); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490,\n507 (1979). But JUSTICE BREYER does not urge that we issue such a\nholding, evidently agreeing that we should limit our review to what the\nCourt of Appeals decided, see Part IV, infra\u2014which included only the\nadequacy of the Commission\u2019s rulemaking procedure, and not the\nstatutory question. Rather, JUSTICE BREYER seeks a \u201cremand [that]\nwould do no more than ask the agency to reconsider its policy decision\nin light of\u201d constitutional concerns. Post, at 21. That strange and novel\ndisposition would be entirely unrelated to the doctrine of constitutional\navoidance, and would better be termed the doctrine of judicial arm\u00ad\ntwisting or appellate review by the wagged finger.\n14         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndistinguish between literal and nonliteral uses of offensive\nwords, requiring repetitive use to render only the latter\nindecent. As the Commission said with regard to expletive\nuse of the F-Word, \u201cthe word\u2019s power to insult and offend\nderives from its sexual meaning.\u201d Id., at 13323, \u00b658. And\nthe Commission\u2019s decision to look at the patent offensive\u00ad\nness of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words\nfits with the context-based approach we sanctioned in\nPacifica, 438 U. S., at 750. Even isolated utterances can\nbe made in \u201cpander[ing,] . . . vulgar and shocking\u201d man\u00ad\nners, Remand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13305, \u00b617, and can\nconstitute harmful \u201c \u2018first blow[s]\u2019 \u201d to children, id., at\n13309, \u00b625. It is surely rational (if not inescapable) to\nbelieve that a safe harbor for single words would \u201clikely\nlead to more widespread use of the offensive language,\u201d\nGolden Globes Order, supra, at 4979, \u00b69.\n   When confronting other requests for per se rules govern\u00ad\ning its enforcement of the indecency prohibition, the\nCommission has declined to create safe harbors for par\u00ad\nticular types of broadcasts. See In re Pacifica Foundation,\nInc., 2 FCC Rcd., at 2699, \u00b612 (repudiating the view that\nthe Commission\u2019s enforcement power was limited to \u201cde\u00ad\nliberate, repetitive use of the seven words actually con\u00ad\ntained in the George Carlin monologue\u201d); In re Infinity\nBroadcasting Corp. of Pa., 3 FCC Rcd., at 932, \u00b617 (\u201cre\u00ad\nject[ing] an approach that would hold that if a work has\nmerit, it is per se not indecent\u201d). The Commission could\nrationally decide it needed to step away from its old re\u00ad\ngime where nonrepetitive use of an expletive was per se\nnonactionable because that was \u201cat odds with the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s overall enforcement policy.\u201d Remand Order,\nsupra, at 13308, \u00b623.\n   The fact that technological advances have made it easier\nfor broadcasters to bleep out offending words further\nsupports the Commission\u2019s stepped-up enforcement policy.\nGolden Globes Order, supra, at 4980, \u00b611.

The Court of Appeals\u2019 Reasoning\n    The Court of Appeals found the Commission\u2019s action\narbitrary and capricious on three grounds. First, the court\ncriticized the Commission for failing to explain why it had\nnot previously banned fleeting expletives as \u201charmful \u2018first\nblow[s].\u2019 \u201d 489 F. 3d, at 458. In the majority\u2019s view, with\u00ad\nout \u201cevidence that suggests a fleeting expletive is harmful\n[and] . . . serious enough to warrant government regula\u00ad\ntion,\u201d the agency could not regulate more broadly. Id., at\n461. As explained above, the fact that an agency had a\nprior stance does not alone prevent it from changing its\nview or create a higher hurdle for doing so. And it is not\nthe Commission, but Congress that has proscribed \u201cany\n. . . indecent . . . language.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464.\n    There are some propositions for which scant empirical\nevidence can be marshaled, and the harmful effect of\nbroadcast profanity on children is one of them. One can\u00ad\nnot demand a multiyear controlled study, in which some\nchildren are intentionally exposed to indecent broadcasts\n(and insulated from all other indecency), and others are\nshielded from all indecency. It is one thing to set aside\nagency action under the Administrative Procedure Act\nbecause of failure to adduce empirical data that can read\u00ad\nily be obtained. See, e.g., State Farm, 463 U. S., at 46\u201356\n(addressing the costs and benefits of mandatory passive\nrestraints for automobiles). It is something else to insist\nupon obtaining the unobtainable. Here it suffices to know\nthat children mimic the behavior they observe\u2014or at least\nthe behavior that is presented to them as normal and\nappropriate. Programming replete with one-word inde\u00ad\ncent expletives will tend to produce children who use (at\n16         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nleast) one-word indecent expletives. Congress has made\nthe determination that indecent material is harmful to\nchildren, and has left enforcement of the ban to the Com\u00ad\nmission. If enforcement had to be supported by empirical\ndata, the ban would effectively be a nullity.\n  The Commission had adduced no quantifiable measure\nof the harm caused by the language in Pacifica, and we\nnonetheless held that the \u201cgovernment\u2019s interest in the\n\u2018well-being of its youth\u2019 . . . justified the regulation of\notherwise protected expression.\u201d 438 U. S., at 749 (quot\u00ad\ning Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 640, 639 (1968)).\nIf the Constitution itself demands of agencies no more\nscientifically certain criteria to comply with the First\nAmendment, neither does the Administrative Procedure\nAct to comply with the requirement of reasoned decision\u00ad\nmaking.\n  The court\u2019s second objection is that fidelity to the\nagency\u2019s \u201cfirst blow\u201d theory of harm would require a cate\u00ad\ngorical ban on all broadcasts of expletives; the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s failure to go to this extreme thus undermined the\ncoherence of its rationale. 489 F. 3d, at 458\u2013459. This\nobjection, however, is not responsive to the Commission\u2019s\nactual policy under review\u2014the decision to include pat\u00ad\nently offensive fleeting expletives within the definition of\nindecency. The Commission\u2019s prior enforcement practice,\nunchallenged here, already drew distinctions between the\noffensiveness of particular words based upon the context\nin which they appeared. Any complaint about the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s failure to ban only some fleeting expletives is\nbetter directed at the agency\u2019s context-based system gen\u00ad\nerally rather than its inclusion of isolated expletives.\n  More fundamentally, however, the agency\u2019s decision to\nconsider the patent offensiveness of isolated expletives on\na case-by-case basis is not arbitrary or capricious. \u201cEven a\nprime-time recitation of Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Miller\u2019s Tale,\u201d\nwe have explained, \u201cwould not be likely to command the\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

The same rationale could\nsupport the Commission\u2019s finding that a broadcast of the\nfilm Saving Private Ryan was not indecent\u2014a finding to\nwhich the broadcasters point as supposed evidence of the\nCommission\u2019s inconsistency. The frightening suspense\nand the graphic violence in the movie could well dissuade\nthe most vulnerable from watching and would put parents\non notice of potentially objectionable material. See In re\nComplaints Against Various Television Licensees Regard\ning Their Broadcast on Nov. 11, 2004 of the ABC Televi\nsion Network\u2019s Presentation of the Film \u201cSaving Private\nRyan,\u201d 20 FCC Rcd. 4507, 4513, \u00b615 (2005) (noting that\nthe broadcast was not \u201cintended as family entertain\u00ad\nment\u201d). The agency\u2019s decision to retain some discretion\ndoes not render arbitrary or capricious its regulation of\nthe deliberate and shocking uses of offensive language at\nthe award shows under review\u2014shows that were expected\nto (and did) draw the attention of millions of children.\n   Finally, the Court of Appeals found unconvincing the\nagency\u2019s prediction (without any evidence) that a per se\nexemption for fleeting expletives would lead to increased\nuse of expletives one at a time. 489 F. 3d, at 460. But\neven in the absence of evidence, the agency\u2019s predictive\njudgment (which merits deference) makes entire sense. To\npredict that complete immunity for fleeting expletives,\nardently desired by broadcasters, will lead to a substantial\nincrease in fleeting expletives seems to us an exercise in\nlogic rather than clairvoyance. The Court of Appeals was\nperhaps correct that the Commission\u2019s prior policy had not\nyet caused broadcasters to \u201cbarrag[e] the airwaves with\nexpletives,\u201d ibid. That may have been because its prior\npermissive policy had been confirmed (save in dicta) only\nat the staff level. In any event, as the Golden Globes order\ndemonstrated, it did produce more expletives than the\n18         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission (which has the first call in this matter)\ndeemed in conformity with the statute.\n                D. Respondents\u2019 Arguments\n  Respondents press some arguments that the court did\nnot adopt. They claim that the Commission failed to\nacknowledge its change in enforcement policy. That con\u00ad\ntention is not tenable in light of the Golden Globes Order\u2019s\nspecific declaration that its prior rulings were no longer\ngood law, 19 FCC Rcd., at 4980, \u00b612, and the Remand\nOrder\u2019s disavowal of those staff rulings and Commission\ndicta as \u201cseriously flawed,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308, \u00b623.\nThe broadcasters also try to recharacterize the nature of\nthe Commission\u2019s shift, contending that the old policy was\nnot actually a per se rule against liability for isolated\nexpletives and that the new policy is a presumption of\nindecency for certain words. This description of the prior\nagency policy conflicts with the broadcasters\u2019 own prior\nposition in this case. See, e.g., Brief in Opposition for\nRespondent Fox Television Stations, Inc., et al. 4 (\u201cFor\nalmost 30 years following Pacifica, the FCC did not con\u00ad\nsider fleeting, isolated or inadvertent expletives to be\nindecent\u201d). And we find no basis for the contention that\nthe Commission has now adopted a presumption of inde\u00ad\ncency; its repeated reliance on context refutes this claim.\n  The broadcasters also make much of the fact that the\nCommission has gone beyond the scope of authority ap\u00ad\nproved in Pacifica, which it once regarded as the farthest\nextent of its power. But we have never held that Pacifica\nrepresented the outer limits of permissible regulation, so\nthat fleeting expletives may not be forbidden. To the\ncontrary, we explicitly left for another day whether \u201can\noccasional expletive\u201d in \u201ca telecast of an Elizabethan\ncomedy\u201d could be prohibited. 438 U. S., at 748.

Nothing\nprohibits federal agencies from moving in an incremental\nmanner. Cf. National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.\nv. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 1002 (2005).\n   Finally, the broadcasters claim that the Commission\u2019s\nrepeated appeal to \u201ccontext\u201d is simply a smokescreen for a\nstandardless regime of unbridled discretion. But we have\npreviously approved Commission regulation based \u201con a\nnuisance rationale under which context is all-important,\u201d\nPacifica, supra, at 750, and we find no basis in the Admin\u00ad\nistrative Procedure Act for mandating anything different.\n                E. The Dissents\u2019 Arguments\n   JUSTICE BREYER purports to \u201cbegin with applicable law,\u201d\npost, at 1, but in fact begins by stacking the deck. He\nclaims that the FCC\u2019s status as an \u201cindependent\u201d agency\nsheltered from political oversight requires courts to be \u201call\nthe more\u201d vigilant in ensuring \u201cthat major policy decisions\nbe based upon articulable reasons.\u201d Post, at 1, 2. Not so.\nThe independent agencies are sheltered not from politics\nbut from the President, and it has often been observed\nthat their freedom from presidential oversight (and protec\u00ad\ntion) has simply been replaced by increased subservience\nto congressional direction. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case, 838\nF. 2d 476, 507\u2013508 (CADC) (Silberman, J.), rev\u2019d sub nom.\nMorrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988); Kagan, Presiden\u00ad\ntial Administration, 114 Harv.

Members\nof the Subcommittee specifically \u201ccalled on the full Commission to\nreverse [the staff ruling in the Golden Globes case]\u201d because they\nperceived a \u201cfeeling amongst many Americans that some broadcasters\nare engaged in a race to the bottom, pushing the decency envelope to\ndistinguish themselves in the increasingly crowded entertainment\nfield.\u201d Id., at 2 (statement of Rep. Upton); see also, e.g., id., at 17\n(statement of Rep. Terry), 19 (statement of Rep. Pitts). They repeatedly\nexpressed disapproval of the FCC\u2019s enforcement policies, see, e.g., id.,\nat 3 (statement of Rep. Upton) (\u201cAt some point we have to ask the FCC:\nHow much is enough? When will it revoke a license?\u201d); id., at 4 (state\u00ad\nment of Rep. Markey) (\u201cToday\u2019s hearing will allow us to explore the\nFCC\u2019s lackluster enforcement record with respect to these violations\u201d).\n   About two weeks later, on February 11, 2004, the same Subcommit\u00ad\ntee held hearings on a bill increasing the fines for indecency violations.\nHearings on H. R 3717 before the Subcommittee on Telecommunica\u00ad\ntions and the Internet of the House Committee on Energy and Com\u00ad\nmerce, 108th Cong., 2d Sess. All five Commissioners were present and\nwere grilled about enforcement shortcomings. See, e.g., id., at 124\n(statement of Rep. Terry) (\u201cChairman Powell, . . . it seems like common\nsense that if we had . . . more frequent enforcement instead of a few\nexamples of fines . . . that would be a deterrent in itself\u201d); id., at 7\n(statement of Rep. Dingell) (\u201cI see that apparently . . . there is no\nenforcement of regulations at the FCC\u201d). Certain statements, more\u00ad\nover, indicate that the political pressure applied by Congress had its\ndesired effect. See ibid. (\u201cI think our committee\u2019s work has gotten the\nattention of FCC Chairman Powell and the Bush Administration.

A version of the bill ultimately became law as the Broadcast\nDecency Enforcement Act of 2005, 120 Stat. 491.\n   The FCC adopted the change that is the subject of this litigation on\nMarch 3, 2004, about three weeks after this second hearing.

In his judgment,\nthe FCC is \u201cbetter viewed as an agent of Congress\u201d than\nas part of the Executive. Post, at 3 (dissenting opinion).\nHe nonetheless argues that this is a good reason for re\u00ad\nquiring the FCC to explain \u201cwhy its prior policy is no\nlonger sound before allowing it to change course.\u201d Post, at\n4. Leaving aside the unconstitutionality of a scheme\ngiving the power to enforce laws to agents of Congress, see\nBowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 726 (1986), it seems to us\nthat JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 conclusion does not follow from his\npremise. If the FCC is indeed an agent of Congress, it\nwould seem an adequate explanation of its change of\nposition that Congress made clear its wishes for stricter\nenforcement, see n. 4, supra.5 The Administrative Proce\u00ad\ndure Act, after all, does not apply to Congress and its\nagencies.6\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 JUSTICE STEVENS accuses us of equating statements made in a con\u00ad\n\ngressional hearing with the intent of Congress. Post, at 4, n. 3. In this\nopinion, we do not. The intent of the full Congress (or at least a major\u00ad\nity of each House) is thought relevant to the interpretation of statutes,\nsince they must be passed by the entire Congress. See U. S. Const.,\nArt. I, \u00a77. It is quite irrelevant, however, to the extrastatutory influ\u00ad\nence Congress exerts over agencies of the Executive Branch, which is\nexerted by the congressional committees responsible for oversight and\nappropriations with respect to the relevant agency. That is a major\nreason why committee assignments are important, and committee\nchairmanships powerful. Surely JUSTICE STEVENS knows this.\n   6 The Administrative Procedure Act defines \u201cagency\u201d to mean \u201ceach\n\nauthority of the Government of the United States,\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7551(1),\nbut specifically excludes \u201cthe Congress,\u201d \u00a7551(1)(A). The Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has \u201cinterpreted [this]\nexemption for \u2018the Congress\u2019 to mean the entire legislative branch,\u201d\nWashington Legal Foundation v. United States Sentencing Comm\u2019n, 17\nF. 3d 1446, 1449 (1994); see also Ethnic Employees of Library of Con\ngress v. Boorstin, 751 F. 2d 1405, 1416, n. 15 (CADC 1985) (holding\nthat the Library of Congress is not an \u201cagency\u201d under the Act).\n22         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                                the Court\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n  Regardless, it is assuredly not \u201capplicable law\u201d that\nrulemaking by independent regulatory agencies is subject\nto heightened scrutiny. The Administrative Procedure\nAct, which provides judicial review, makes no distinction\nbetween independent and other agencies, neither in its\ndefinition of agency, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701(b)(1), nor in the stan\u00ad\ndards for reviewing agency action, \u00a7706. Nor does any\ncase of ours express or reflect the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d\nJUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE STEVENS would impose.\nIndeed, it is hard to imagine any closer scrutiny than that\nwe have given to the Environmental Protection Agency,\nwhich is not an independent agency. See Massachusetts v.\nEPA, 549 U. S. 497, 533\u2013535 (2007); Whitman v. American\nTrucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 481\u2013486 (2001).\nThere is no reason to magnify the separation-of-powers\ndilemma posed by the Headless Fourth Branch, see Frey\ntag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 921 (1991) (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment), by letting\nArticle III judges\u2014like jackals stealing the lion\u2019s kill\u2014\nexpropriate some of the power that Congress has wrested\nfrom the unitary Executive.\n  JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE STEVENS rely upon two\nsupposed omissions in the FCC\u2019s analysis that they believe\npreclude a finding that the agency did not act arbitrarily.\nNeither of these omissions could undermine the coherence\nof the rationale the agency gave, but the dissenters\u2019\nevaluation of each is flawed in its own right.\n  First, both claim that the Commission failed adequately\nto explain its consideration of the constitutional issues\ninherent in its regulation, post, at 7\u201311 (opinion of\nBREYER, J.); post, at 4\u20137 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). We are\nunaware that we have ever before reversed an executive\nagency, not for violating our cases, but for failure to dis\u00ad\ncuss them adequately. But leave that aside. According to\nJUSTICE BREYER, the agency said \u201cnext to nothing about\nthe relation between the change it made in its prior \u2018fleet\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   23\n\n                                    the Court\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\ning expletive\u2019 policy and the First-Amendment-related\nneed to avoid \u2018censorship,\u2019 \u201d post, at 7\u20138. The Remand\nOrder does, however, devote four full pages of small-type,\nsingle-spaced text (over 1,300 words not counting the\nfootnotes) to explaining why the Commission believes that\nits indecency-enforcement regime (which includes its\nchange in policy) is consistent with the First Amend\u00ad\nment\u2014and therefore not censorship as the term is under\u00ad\nstood. More specifically, JUSTICE BREYER faults the FCC\nfor \u201cnot explain[ing] why the agency changed its mind\nabout the line that Pacifica draws or its policy\u2019s relation to\nthat line,\u201d post, at 10. But in fact (and as the Commission\nexplained) this Court\u2019s holding in Pacifica, 438 U. S. 726,\ndrew no constitutional line; to the contrary, it expressly\ndeclined to express any view on the constitutionality of\nprohibiting isolated indecency. JUSTICE BREYER and\nJUSTICE STEVENS evidently believe that when an agency\nhas obtained this Court\u2019s determination that a less restric\u00ad\ntive rule is constitutional, its successors acquire some\nspecial burden to explain why a more restrictive rule is\nnot unconstitutional. We know of no such principle.7\n   Second, JUSTICE BREYER looks over the vast field of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes us for \u201cassuming that Pacifica endorsed\u201d\n\nthe enforcement at issue here. Post, at 4. We do nothing of the sort.\nWe rely on the fact that certain aspects of the agency\u2019s decision mirror\nthe context-based approach Pacifica approved, supra, at 14, but that\ngoes to our holding on administrative law, and says nothing about\nconstitutionality. JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that heightened defer\u00ad\nence should be due the FCC\u2019s prior policy because the \u201cFCC\u2019s initial\nviews . . . reflect the views of the Congress that delegated the Commis\u00ad\nsion authority to flesh out details not fully defined in the enacting\nstatute.\u201d Post, at 3. We do not believe that the dead hand of a departed\nCongressional oversight Committee should constrain the discretion that\nthe text of a statute confers\u2014but the point is in any event irrelevant in\nthis appeal, which concerns not whether the agency has exceeded its\nstatutory mandate but whether the reasons for its actions are ade\u00ad\nquate.\n24         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                                 the Court\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nparticular factual scenarios unaddressed by the FCC\u2019s 35\u00ad\npage Remand Order and finds one that is fatal: the plight\nof the small local broadcaster who cannot afford the new\ntechnology that enables the screening of live broadcasts\nfor indecent utterances. Cf. post, at 11\u201316. The Commis\u00ad\nsion has failed to address the fate of this unfortunate, who\nwill, he believes, be subject to sanction.\n   We doubt, to begin with, that small-town broadcasters\nrun a heightened risk of liability for indecent utterances.\nIn programming that they originate, their down-home\nlocal guests probably employ vulgarity less than big-city\nfolks; and small-town stations generally cannot afford or\ncannot attract foul-mouthed glitteratae from Hollywood.\nTheir main exposure with regard to self-originated pro\u00ad\ngramming is live coverage of news and public affairs. But\nthe Remand Order went out of its way to note that the\ncase at hand did not involve \u201cbreaking news coverage,\u201d\nand that \u201cit may be inequitable to hold a licensee respon\u00ad\nsible for airing offensive speech during live coverage of a\npublic event,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13311, \u00b633. As for the\nprogramming that small stations receive on a network\n\u201cfeed\u201d: This will be cleansed by the expensive technology\nsmall stations (by JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s hypothesis) cannot\nafford.\n   But never mind the detail of whether small broadcasters\nare uniquely subject to a great risk of punishment for\nfleeting expletives. The fundamental fallacy of JUSTICE\nBREYER\u2019s small-broadcaster gloomyscenario is its demon\u00ad\nstrably false assumption that the Remand Order makes no\nprovision for the avoidance of unfairness\u2014that the single\u00ad\nutterance prohibition will be invoked uniformly, in all\nsituations. The Remand Order made very clear that this\nis not the case. It said that in determining \u201cwhat, if any,\nremedy is appropriate\u201d the Commission would consider\nthe facts of each individual case, such as the \u201cpossibility of\nhuman error in using delay equipment,\u201d id., at 13313, \u00b635.\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 25\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nThus, the fact that the agency believed that Fox (a large\nbroadcaster that used suggestive scripting and a deficient\ndelay system to air a prime-time awards show aimed at\nmillions of children) \u201cfail[ed] to exercise \u2018reasonable judg\u00ad\nment, responsibility and sensitivity,\u2019 \u201d id., at 13311, \u00b633,\nand n. 91 (quoting Pacifica Foundation, Inc., 2 FCC Rcd.,\nat 2700, \u00b618), says little about how the Commission would\ntreat smaller broadcasters who cannot afford screening\nequipment. Indeed, that they would not be punished for\nfailing to purchase equipment they cannot afford is posi\u00ad\ntively suggested by the Remand Order\u2019s statement that\n\u201c[h]olding Fox responsible for airing indecent material in\nthis case does not . . . impose undue burdens on broadcast\u00ad\ners.\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13313, \u00b636.\n   There was, in sum, no need for the Commission to com\u00ad\npose a special treatise on local broadcasters.8          And\nJUSTICE BREYER can safely defer his concern for those\nyeomen of the airwaves until we have before us a case that\ninvolves one.\n                     IV. Constitutionality\n  The Second Circuit did not definitively rule on the con\u00ad\nstitutionality of the Commission\u2019s orders, but respondents\nnonetheless ask us to decide their validity under the First\nAmendment. This Court, however, is one of final review,\n\u201cnot of first view.\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718,\nn. 7 (2005). It is conceivable that the Commission\u2019s orders\nmay cause some broadcasters to avoid certain language\nthat is beyond the Commission\u2019s reach under the Consti\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 JUSTICE BREYER posits that the FCC would have been required to\ngive more explanation had it used notice-and-comment rulemaking,\nwhich \u201cshould lead us to the same conclusion\u201d in this review of the\nagency\u2019s change through adjudication. Post, at 17. Even assuming the\npremise, there is no basis for incorporating all of the Administrative\nProcedure Act\u2019s notice-and-comment procedural requirements into\narbitrary-and-capricious review of adjudicatory decisions. Cf. Vermont\nYankee, 435 U. S., at 545\u2013549.\n26         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntution. Whether that is so, and, if so, whether it is uncon\u00ad\nstitutional, will be determined soon enough, perhaps in\nthis very case. Meanwhile, any chilled references to excre\u00ad\ntory and sexual material \u201csurely lie at the periphery of\nFirst Amendment concern,\u201d Pacifica, 438 U. S., at 743\n(plurality opinion of STEVENS, J.). We see no reason to\nabandon our usual procedures in a rush to judgment\nwithout a lower court opinion. We decline to address the\nconstitutional questions at this time.\n                        *     *     *\n   The Second Circuit believed that children today \u201clikely\nhear this language far more often from other sources than\nthey did in the 1970\u2019s when the Commission first began\nsanctioning indecent speech,\u201d and that this cuts against\nmore stringent regulation of broadcasts. 489 F. 3d, at 461.\nAssuming the premise is true (for this point the Second\nCircuit did not demand empirical evidence) the conclusion\ndoes not necessarily follow. The Commission could rea\u00ad\nsonably conclude that the pervasiveness of foul language,\nand the coarsening of public entertainment in other media\nsuch as cable, justify more stringent regulation of broad\u00ad\ncast programs so as to give conscientious parents a rela\u00ad\ntively safe haven for their children.

See Red Lion Broadcast\ning Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969); FCC v. Pacifica\nFoundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). Red Lion and Pacifica\nwere unconvincing when they were issued, and the pas\nsage of time has only increased doubt regarding their\ncontinued validity. \u201cThe text of the First Amendment\nmakes no distinctions among print, broadcast, and cable\nmedia, but we have done so\u201d in these cases. Denver Area\nEd. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518\nU. S. 727, 812 (1996) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part).\n   In Red Lion, this Court upheld the so-called \u201cfairness\ndoctrine,\u201d a Government requirement \u201cthat discussion of\npublic issues be presented on broadcast stations, and that\neach side of those issues must be given fair coverage.\u201d 395\nU. S., at 369, 400\u2013401. The decision relied heavily on the\n2          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nscarcity of available broadcast frequencies. According to\nthe Court, because broadcast spectrum was so scarce, it\n\u201ccould be regulated and rationalized only by the Govern\nment. Without government control, the medium would be\nof little use because of the cacophony of competing voices,\nnone of which could be clearly and predictably heard.\u201d Id.,\nat 376. To this end, the Court concluded that the Gov\nernment should be \u201cpermitted to put restraints on licen\nsees in favor of others whose views should be expressed on\nthis unique medium.\u201d Id., at 390; see also id., at 389\n(concluding that \u201cas far as the First Amendment is con\ncerned those who are licensed stand no better than those\nto whom licenses are refused\u201d). Applying this principle,\nthe Court held that \u201c[i]t does not violate the First\nAmendment to treat licensees given the privilege of using\nscarce radio frequencies as proxies for the entire commu\nnity, obligated to give suitable time and attention to mat\nters of great public concern.\u201d Id., at 394.\n  Red Lion specifically declined to answer whether the\nFirst Amendment authorized the Government\u2019s \u201crefusal to\npermit the broadcaster to carry a particular program or to\npublish his own views[,] . . . [or] government censorship of\na particular program,\u201d id., at 396. But then in Pacifica,\nthis Court rejected a challenge to the FCC\u2019s authority to\nimpose sanctions on the broadcast of indecent material.\nSee 438 U. S., at 729\u2013730, 750\u2013751; id., at 742 (plurality\nopinion), relying on Red Lion, the Court noted that \u201cbroad\ncasting . . . has received the most limited First Amend\nment protection.\u201d 438 U. S., at 748. The Court also em\nphasized the \u201cuniquely pervasive presence\u201d of the\nbroadcast media in Americans\u2019 lives and the fact that\nbroadcast programming was \u201cuniquely accessible to chil\ndren.\u201d Id., at 748\u2013749.\n  This deep intrusion into the First Amendment rights of\nbroadcasters, which the Court has justified based only on\nthe nature of the medium, is problematic on two levels.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nFirst, instead of looking to first principles to evaluate the\nconstitutional question, the Court relied on a set of transi\ntory facts, e.g., the \u201cscarcity of radio frequencies,\u201d Red\nLion, supra, at 390, to determine the applicable First\nAmendment standard. But the original meaning of the\nConstitution cannot turn on modern necessity: \u201cConstitu\ntional rights are enshrined with the scope they were un\nderstood to have when the people adopted them, whether\nor not future legislatures or (yes) even future judges think\nthat scope too broad.\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller, 554\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 63). In breaching this\nprinciple, Red Lion adopted, and Pacifica reaffirmed, a\nlegal rule that lacks any textual basis in the Constitution.\nDenver Area, supra, at 813 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cFirst Amend\nment distinctions between media [have been] dubious from\ntheir infancy\u201d). Indeed, the logical weakness of Red Lion\nand Pacifica has been apparent for some time: \u201cIt is cer\ntainly true that broadcast frequencies are scarce but it is\nunclear why that fact justifies content regulation of broad\ncasting in a way that would be intolerable if applied to the\neditorial process of the print media.\u201d Telecommunications\nResearch & Action Center v. FCC, 801 F. 2d 501, 508\n(CADC 1986) (Bork, J.).\n   Highlighting the doctrinal incoherence of Red Lion and\nPacifica, the Court has declined to apply the lesser stan\ndard of First Amendment scrutiny imposed on broadcast\nspeech to federal regulation of telephone dial-in services,\nsee Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S.\n115, 127\u2013128 (1989), cable television programming, see\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,\n637 (1994), and the Internet, see Reno v. American Civil\nLiberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 867\u2013868 (1997). \u201cThere is\nno justification for this apparent dichotomy in First\nAmendment jurisprudence.          Whatever the merits of\nPacifica when it was issued[,] . . . it makes no sense now.\u201d\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nAction for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, 58 F. 3d 654, 673\n(CADC 1995) (Edwards, C. J., dissenting). The justifica\ntions relied on by the Court in Red Lion and Pacifica\u2014\n\u201cspectrum scarcity, intrusiveness, and accessibility to\nchildren\u2014neither distinguish broadcast from cable, nor\nexplain the relaxed application of the principles of the\nFirst Amendment to broadcast.\u201d 58 F. 3d, at 673; see also\nIn re Industry Guidance on Commission\u2019s Case Law Inter\npreting 18 U.

American Civil Liberties\nUnion, 521 U. S. 844 (1997)], than would the same exact\ncontent broadcast over-the-air\u201d).\n   Second, even if this Court\u2019s disfavored treatment of\nbroadcasters under the First Amendment could have been\njustified at the time of Red Lion and Pacifica, dramatic\ntechnological advances have eviscerated the factual as\nsumptions underlying those decisions. Broadcast spec\ntrum is significantly less scarce than it was 40 years ago.\nSee Brief for Respondents NBC Universal et al. 37\u201338\n(hereinafter NBC Brief). As NBC notes, the number of\nover-the-air broadcast stations grew from 7,411 in 1969,\nwhen Red Lion was issued, to 15,273 by the end of 2004.\nSee NBC Brief 38; see also FCC Media Bureau Staff Re\nsearch Paper, J. Berresford, The Scarcity Rationale for\nRegulating Traditional Broadcasting: An Idea Whose Time\nHas Passed 12\u201313 (Mar. 2005) (No. 2005\u20132). And the\ntrend should continue with broadcast television\u2019s immi\nnent switch from analog to digital transmission, which\nwill allow the FCC to \u201cstack broadcast channels right\nbeside one another along the spectrum, and ultimately\nutilize significantly less than the 400 MHz of spectrum the\nanalog system absorbs today.\u201d Consumer Electronics\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

For most consumers, traditional broadcast media\nprogramming is now bundled with cable or satellite ser\nvices. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a. Broadcast and\nother video programming is also widely available over the\nInternet. See Stelter, Serving Up Television Without the\nTV Set, N. Y. Times, Mar. 10, 2008, p. C1. And like radio\nand television broadcasts, Internet access is now often\nfreely available over the airwaves and can be accessed by\nportable computer, cell phones, and other wireless devices.\nSee May, Charting a New Constitutional Jurisprudence\nfor the Digital Age, 3 Charleston L. Rev. 373, 375 (2009).\nThe extant facts that drove this Court to subject broad\ncasters to unique disfavor under the First Amendment\nsimply do not exist today. See In re Industry Guidance,\nsupra, at 8020 (statement of Commissioner Furchtgott-\nRoth) (\u201cIf rules regulating broadcast content were ever a\njustifiable infringement of speech, it was because of the\nrelative dominance of that medium in the communications\nmarketplace of the past. As the Commission has long\nrecognized, the facts underlying this justification are no\nlonger true\u201d (footnote omitted)).*\n  These dramatic changes in factual circumstances might\nwell support a departure from precedent under the pre\nvailing approach to stare decisis.

This separate writing is to underscore certain\nbackground principles for the conclusion that an agency\u2019s\ndecision to change course may be arbitrary and capricious\nif the agency sets a new course that reverses an earlier\ndetermination but does not provide a reasoned explana\u00ad\ntion for doing so. In those circumstances I agree with the\ndissenting opinion of JUSTICE BREYER that the agency\nmust explain why \u201cit now reject[s] the considerations that\nled it to adopt that initial policy.\u201d Post, at 5.\n   The question whether a change in policy requires an\nagency to provide a more-reasoned explanation than when\nthe original policy was first announced is not susceptible,\nin my view, to an answer that applies in all cases. There\nmay be instances when it becomes apparent to an agency\nthat the reasons for a longstanding policy have been al\u00ad\ntered by discoveries in science, advances in technology, or\nby any of the other forces at work in a dynamic society. If\nan agency seeks to respond to new circumstances by modi\u00ad\nfying its earlier policy, the agency may have a substantial\nbody of data and experience that can shape and inform the\n2          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nnew rule. In other cases the altered circumstances may be\nso new that the agency must make predictive judgments\nthat are as difficult now as when the agency\u2019s earlier\npolicy was first announced. Reliance interests in the prior\npolicy may also have weight in the analysis.\n   The question in each case is whether the agency\u2019s rea\u00ad\nsons for the change, when viewed in light of the data\navailable to it, and when informed by the experience and\nexpertise of the agency, suffice to demonstrate that the\nnew policy rests upon principles that are rational, neutral,\nand in accord with the agency\u2019s proper understanding of\nits authority. That showing may be required if the agency\nis to demonstrate that its action is not \u201carbitrary, capri\u00ad\ncious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor\u00ad\ndance with law.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A). And, of course, the\nagency action must not be \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdic\u00ad\ntion, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\u201d\n\u00a7706(2)(C).\n   These requirements stem from the administrative\nagency\u2019s unique constitutional position. The dynamics of\nthe three branches of Government are well understood as\na general matter. But the role and position of the agency,\nand the exact locus of its powers, present questions that\nare delicate, subtle, and complex. The Federal Govern\u00ad\nment could not perform its duties in a responsible and\neffective way without administrative agencies. Yet the\namorphous character of the administrative agency in the\nconstitutional system escapes simple explanation.\n   If agencies were permitted unbridled discretion, their\nactions might violate important constitutional principles\nof separation of powers and checks and balances. To that\nend the Constitution requires that Congress\u2019 delegation of\nlawmaking power to an agency must be \u201cspecific and\ndetailed.\u201d Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 374\n(1989). Congress must \u201cclearly delineat[e] the general\npolicy\u201d an agency is to achieve and must specify the\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Id., at 372\n(quoting J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276\nU. S. 394, 409 (1928)).\n   Congress passed the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA) to ensure that agencies follow constraints even as\nthey exercise their powers. One of these constraints is the\nduty of agencies to find and formulate policies that can be\njustified by neutral principles and a reasoned explanation.\nTo achieve that end, Congress confined agencies\u2019 discre\u00ad\ntion and subjected their decisions to judicial review. See\nR. Stewart & C. Sunstein, Public Programs and Private\nRights, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1193, 1248 (1982) (the APA was a\n\u201cworking compromise, in which broad delegations of dis\u00ad\ncretion were tolerated as long as they were checked by\nextensive procedural safeguards\u201d). If an agency takes\naction not based on neutral and rational principles, the\nAPA grants federal courts power to set aside the agency\u2019s\naction as \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A);\nCitizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U. S.\n402, 416 (1971). For these reasons, agencies under the\nAPA are subject to a \u201csearching and careful\u201d review by the\ncourts. Ibid.\n   Where there is a policy change the record may be much\nmore developed because the agency based its prior policy\non factual findings. In that instance, an agency\u2019s decision\nto change course may be arbitrary and capricious if the\nagency ignores or countermands its earlier factual find\u00ad\nings without reasoned explanation for doing so. An agency\ncannot simply disregard contrary or inconvenient factual\ndeterminations that it made in the past, any more than it\ncan ignore inconvenient facts when it writes on a blank\nslate.\n   This is the principle followed in the Court\u2019s opinion in\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nFarm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29 (1983).\nThere, Congress directed the agency to issue regulations\nthat would \u201c \u2018meet the need for motor vehicle safety.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 33. The agency promulgated a regulation requiring\ncars to have passive-restraint systems\u2014either airbags or\nautomatic seatbelts. Id., at 37. The agency based this\nregulation on its factual finding that these systems save\nlives. Id., at 35.\n   Following a change in Presidential administration,\nhowever, the agency reversed course and rescinded the\nregulation. In doing so, the agency did not address its\nprior finding that airbags save lives. Id., at 47\u201348. In\u00ad\ndeed, \u201c[n]ot one sentence\u201d of the agency\u2019s \u201crulemaking\nstatement\u201d in support of rescinding the regulation dis\u00ad\ncussed the benefits of airbags. Id., at 48. This Court\nfound the agency\u2019s rescission arbitrary and capricious\nbecause the agency did not address its prior factual find\u00ad\nings. See id., at 49\u201351.\n   The present case does not raise the concerns addressed\nin State Farm. Rather than base its prior policy on its\nknowledge of the broadcast industry and its audience, the\nFCC instead based its policy on what it considered to be\nour holding in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726\n(1978). See In re Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation,\n69 F. C. C. 2d 1250, 1254, \u00b610 (1978) (\u201cWe intend strictly\nto observe the narrowness of the Pacifica holding\u201d). The\nFCC did not base its prior policy on factual findings.\n   The FCC\u2019s Remand Order explains that the agency has\nchanged its reading of Pacifica. The reasons the agency\nannounces for this change are not so precise, detailed, or\nelaborate as to be a model for agency explanation. But, as\nthe opinion for the Court well explains, the FCC\u2019s reasons\nfor its action were the sort of reasons an agency may\nconsider and act upon. The Court\u2019s careful and complete\nanalysis\u2014both with respect to the procedural history of\nthe FCC\u2019s indecency policies, and the reasons the agency\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

I agree with the Court that as this case\ncomes to us from the Court of Appeals we must reserve\njudgment on the question whether the agency\u2019s action is\nconsistent with the guarantees of the Constitution.\n                   Cite as: 556 U.

Apparently assuming that the Federal Communica\u00ad\ntions Commission\u2019s (FCC or Commission) rulemaking\nauthority is a species of executive power, the Court es\u00ad\npouses the novel proposition that the Commission need\nnot explain its decision to discard a longstanding rule in\nfavor of a dramatically different approach to regulation.\nSee ante, at 10\u201311. Moreover, the Court incorrectly as\u00ad\nsumes that our decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,\n438 U. S. 726 (1978), decided that the word \u201cindecent,\u201d as\nused in 18 U. S.

But the FCC is constrained by its\ncongressional mandate. There should be a strong pre\u00ad\nsumption that the FCC\u2019s initial views, reflecting the in\u00ad\nformed judgment of independent commissioners with\nexpertise in the regulated area, also reflect the views of\nthe Congress that delegated the Commission authority to\nflesh out details not fully defined in the enacting statute.\nThe rules adopted after Pacifica, 438 U. S. 726, have been\nin effect for decades and have not proved unworkable in\nthe intervening years. As JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s opinion\nexplains, broadcasters have a substantial interest in\nregulatory stability; the threat of crippling financial pen\u00ad\nalties looms large over these entities. See post, at 10\u201314.\nThe FCC\u2019s shifting and impermissibly vague indecency\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE  SCALIA erroneously concludes that treating the FCC\u2019s rule\u00ad\nmaking authority as an exercise of legislative power would somehow be\nunconstitutional. See ante, at 21 (citing Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S.\n714, 726 (1986)). But that is the nature of rulemaking: Rules promul\u00ad\ngated by agencies (independent or not) carry the force of law precisely\nbecause they are exercises of such legislative authority. This may\noffend JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s theory of the \u201cunitary Executive,\u201d ante, at 22,\nbut it does not offend the Constitution. Indeed, \u201cthe Framers vested\n\u2018All legislative Powers\u2019 in the Congress, Art. I, \u00a71, just as in Article II\nthey vested the \u2018executive Power\u2019 in the President, Art.

It therefore makes eminent sense to\nrequire the Commission to justify why its prior policy is no\nlonger sound before allowing it to change course.3 The\nFCC\u2019s congressional charter, 47 U. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq., the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(2)(A) (2006\ned.)

S. C. \u00a71464, that would include any\nexpletive that has a sexual or excretory origin. Neither\nthe opinion of the Court, nor Justice Powell\u2019s concurring\nopinion, adopted such a far-reaching interpretation. Our\nholding was narrow in two critical respects. First, we\nconcluded, over the dissent of four Justices, that the statu\u00ad\ntory term \u201cindecent\u201d was not limited to material that had\nprurient appeal and instead included material that was in\n\u201cnonconformance with accepted standards of morality.\u201d\nPacifica, 438 U.

Second, we upheld the FCC\u2019s\nadjudication that a 12-minute, expletive-filled monologue\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 It appears that JUSTICE SCALIA has come to the view that isolated\n\nstatements by members of a congressional oversight subcommittee are\nsufficient evidence of Congress\u2019 intent. See ante, at 20, n. 4. Delving\ninto the details of how various lawmakers \u201cgrilled\u201d the full slate of FCC\nCommissioners, JUSTICE SCALIA concludes, quite remarkably, that this\nencounter \u201cmade clear [Congress\u2019] wishes for stricter enforcement\u201d and\n\u201cwould seem an adequate explanation of [the FCC\u2019s] change of posi\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Ante, at 21. Putting to the side the question whether congres\u00ad\nsional outrage is the kind of evidence sufficient to explain the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s decision to adopt a thinly-reasoned and unconstitutional policy,\nJUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s treatment of these proceedings as evidencing the\nintent of Congress would make even the most ardent student of legisla\u00ad\ntive history blush.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

We did not decide whether an isolated\nexpletive could qualify as indecent. Id., at 750; id., at\n760\u2013761 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). And we certainly did not hold that any word\nwith a sexual or scatological origin, however used, was\nindecent.\n   The narrow treatment of the term \u201cindecent\u201d in Pacifica\ndefined the outer boundaries of the enforcement policies\nadopted by the FCC in the ensuing years. The Commis\u00ad\nsion originally explained that \u201cunder the legal standards\nset forth in Pacifica, deliberate and repetitive use [of\nexpletives] in a patently offensive manner is a requisite to\na finding of indecency.\u201d In re Pacifica Foundation, 2 FCC\nRcd. 2698, 2699, \u00b613 (1987). While the \u201crepetitive use\u201d\nissue has received the most attention in this case, it\nshould not be forgotten that Pacifica permitted the Com\u00ad\nmission to regulate only those words that describe sex or\nexcrement. See 438 U. S., at 743 (plurality opinion)\n(\u201c[T]he Commission\u2019s definition of indecency will deter\nonly the broadcasting of patently offensive references to\nexcretory and sexual organs and activities\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). The FCC minimizes the strength of this limita\u00ad\ntion by now claiming that any use of the words at issue in\nthis case, in any context and in any form, necessarily\ndescribes sex or excrement. See In re Complaints Regard\ning Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2,\n2002 and March 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 13299, 13308, \u00b623\n(2006) (Remand Order) (\u201c[A]ny strict dichotomy between\nexpletives and descriptions or depictions of sexual or\nexcretory functions is artificial and does not make sense in\nlight of the fact that an expletive\u2019s power to offend derives\nfrom its sexual or excretory meaning\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). The customs of speech refute this claim:\nThere is a critical distinction between the use of an exple\u00ad\ntive to describe a sexual or excretory function and the use\n6             FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof such a word for an entirely different purpose, such as to\nexpress an emotion. One rests at the core of indecency;\nthe other stands miles apart. As any golfer who has\nwatched his partner shank a short approach knows, it\nwould be absurd to accept the suggestion that the resul\u00ad\ntant four-letter word uttered on the golf course describes\nsex or excrement and is therefore indecent. But that is the\nabsurdity the FCC has embraced in its new approach to\nindecency.4 See In re Complaints Against Various Broad\ncast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \u201cGolden Globe\nAwards\u201d Program, 19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4978\u20134979, \u00b6\u00b68\u20139\n(2004) (declaring that even the use of an expletive to\nemphasize happiness \u201cinvariably invokes a coarse sexual\nimage\u201d).\n   Even if the words that concern the Court in this case\nsometimes retain their sexual or excretory meaning, there\nare surely countless instances in which they are used in a\nmanner unrelated to their origin. These words may not be\npolite, but that does not mean they are necessarily \u201cinde\u00ad\ncent\u201d under \u00a71464. By improperly equating the two, the\nCommission has adopted an interpretation of \u201cindecency\u201d\nthat bears no resemblance to what Pacifica contemplated.5\nMost distressingly, the Commission appears to be entirely\nunaware of this fact, see Remand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at\n13308 (erroneously referencing Pacifica in support of its\nnew policy), and today\u2019s majority seems untroubled by this\nsignificant oversight, see ante, at 4\u20135, 13\u201314.

This appeal, I recognize, arises under\nthe Administrative Procedure Act.* JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s\ndissenting opinion, which I join, cogently describes the\ninfirmities of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s\n(FCC or Commission) policy switch under that Act.

Nor\ndoes the Commission\u2019s policy home in on expressions used\nto describe sexual or excretory activities or organs.

Its\nexplanation fails to discuss two critical factors, at least\none of which directly underlay its original policy decision.\nIts explanation instead discussed several factors well\nknown to it the first time around, which by themselves\nprovide no significant justification for a change of policy.\nConsequently, the FCC decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious,\nan abuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U.

That law grants those in\ncharge of independent administrative agencies broad\nauthority to determine relevant policy. But it does not\npermit them to make policy choices for purely political\n2          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nreasons nor to rest them primarily upon unexplained\npolicy preferences. Federal Communications Commission\u00ad\ners have fixed terms of office; they are not directly respon\u00ad\nsible to the voters; and they enjoy an independence ex\u00ad\npressly designed to insulate them, to a degree, from \u201c \u2018the\nexercise of political oversight.\u2019 \u201d Freytag v.

That insulation helps to\nsecure important governmental objectives, such as the\nconstitutionally related objective of maintaining broadcast\nregulation that does not bend too readily before the politi\u00ad\ncal winds. But that agency\u2019s comparative freedom from\nballot-box control makes it all the more important that\ncourts review its decisionmaking to assure compliance\nwith applicable provisions of the law\u2014including law re\u00ad\nquiring that major policy decisions be based upon articu\u00ad\nlable reasons.\n  The statutory provision applicable here is the Adminis\u00ad\ntrative Procedure Act\u2019s (APA) prohibition of agency action\nthat is \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,\u201d 5\nU.

And, as\nthis Court has specified, in determining whether an\nagency\u2019s policy choice was \u201carbitrary,\u201d a reviewing court\n\u201cmust consider whether the decision was based on a con\u00ad\nsideration of the relevant factors and whether there has\nbeen a clear error of judgment.\u201d Overton Park, supra, at\n416.\n   Moreover, an agency must act consistently. The agency\nmust follow its own rules. Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchi\nson, T. & S. F. R. Co., 284 U. S. 370, 389\u2013390 (1932). And\nwhen an agency seeks to change those rules, it must focus\non the fact of change and explain the basis for that\nchange. See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications\nAssn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981\n(2005) (\u201cUnexplained inconsistency is\u201d a \u201creason for hold\u00ad\ning an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious\nchange from agency practice\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   To explain a change requires more than setting forth\nreasons why the new policy is a good one. It also requires\nthe agency to answer the question, \u201cWhy did you change?\u201d\nAnd a rational answer to this question typically requires a\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmore complete explanation than would prove satisfactory\nwere change itself not at issue. An (imaginary) adminis\u00ad\ntrator explaining why he chose a policy that requires\ndriving on the right-side, rather than the left-side, of the\nroad might say, \u201cWell, one side seemed as good as the\nother, so I flipped a coin.\u201d But even assuming the ration\u00ad\nality of that explanation for an initial choice, that expla\u00ad\nnation is not at all rational if offered to explain why the\nadministrator changed driving practice, from right-side to\nleft-side, 25 years later.\n   In State Farm, a unanimous Court applied these com\u00ad\nmonsense requirements to an agency decision that re\u00ad\nscinded an earlier agency policy. The Court wrote that an\nagency must provide an explanation for the agency\u2019s \u201crevo\ncation\u201d of a prior action that is more thorough than the\nexplanation necessary when it does not act in the first\ninstance. The Court defined \u201crevocation,\u201d not simply as\nrescinding an earlier policy, cf. ante, at 10\u201311, but as \u201ca\nreversal of the agency\u2019s former views as to the proper\ncourse.\u201d State Farm, 463 U. S., at 41 (emphasis added).\nSee also Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S.\n467, 502, n. 20 (2002) (portion of Court\u2019s opinion joined by\nSCALIA, KENNEDY, and THOMAS, JJ.)

It\nsaid that the law required an explanation for such a\nchange because the earlier policy, representing a \u201c \u2018settled\ncourse of behavior[,] embodies the agency\u2019s informed\njudgment that, by pursuing that course, it will carry out\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Thus, the agency must\nexplain why it has come to the conclusion that it should\nnow change direction. Why does it now reject the consid\u00ad\nerations that led it to adopt that initial policy? What has\nchanged in the world that offers justification for the\nchange? What other good reasons are there for departing\nfrom the earlier policy?\n   Contrary to the majority\u2019s characterization of this dis\u00ad\nsent, it would not (and State Farm does not) require a\n\u201cheightened standard\u201d of review. Ante, at 10 (emphasis\nadded). Rather, the law requires application of the same\nstandard of review to different circumstances, namely\ncircumstances characterized by the fact that change is at\nissue. It requires the agency to focus upon the fact of\nchange where change is relevant, just as it must focus\nupon any other relevant circumstance. It requires the\nagency here to focus upon the reasons that led the agency\nto adopt the initial policy, and to explain why it now comes\nto a new judgment.\n   I recognize that sometimes the ultimate explanation for\na change may have to be, \u201cWe now weigh the relevant\nconsiderations differently.\u201d But at other times, an agency\ncan and should say more. Where, for example, the agency\nrested its previous policy on particular factual findings,\nsee ante, at 3\u20135 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment); or where an agency rested its\nprior policy on its view of the governing law, see infra, at\n7\u201311; or where an agency rested its previous policy on,\nsay, a special need to coordinate with another agency, one\nwould normally expect the agency to focus upon those\nearlier views of fact, of law, or of policy and explain why\nthey are no longer controlling. Regardless, to say that the\nagency here must answer the question \u201cwhy change\u201d is not\nto require the agency to provide a justification that is\n\u201cbetter than the reasons for the old [policy].\u201d Ante, at 11.\n6          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nIt is only to recognize the obvious fact that change is some\u00ad\ntimes (not always) a relevant background feature that\nsometimes (not always) requires focus (upon prior justifi\u00ad\ncations) and explanation lest the adoption of the new\npolicy (in that circumstance) be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an\nabuse of discretion.\u201d\n   That is certainly how courts of appeals, the courts that\nreview agency decisions, have always treated the matter\nin practice. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Federation of Sports\nmen\u2019s Clubs, Inc. v. Kempthorne, 497 F. 3d 337, 351 (CA3\n2007); Yale-New Haven Hosp. v. Leavitt, 470 F. 3d 71, 79\n(CA2 2006); Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. United\nStates, 391 F. 3d 338, 352 (CA1 2004). But see NAACP v.\nFCC, 682 F. 2d 993, 998 (CADC 1982) (using word \u201cheight\u00ad\nened\u201d). The majority\u2019s holding could in this respect sig\u00ad\nnificantly change judicial review in practice, and not in a\nhealthy direction. But see, ante, at 1\u20135 (KENNEDY, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment). After all,\nif it is always legally sufficient for the agency to reply to\nthe question \u201cwhy change?\u201d with the answer \u201cwe prefer\nthe new policy\u201d (even when the agency has not considered\nthe major factors that led it to adopt its old policy), then\nwhy bother asking the agency to focus on the fact of\nchange? More to the point, why would the law exempt this\nand no other aspect of an agency decision from \u201carbitrary,\ncapricious\u201d review? Where does, and why would, the APA\ngrant agencies the freedom to change major policies on the\nbasis of nothing more than political considerations or even\npersonal whim?\n   Avoiding the application of any heightened standard of\nreview, the Court in State Farm recognized that the APA\u2019s\n\u201cnonarbitrary\u201d requirement affords agencies generous\nleeway when they set policy. 463 U. S., at 42. But it also\nrecognized that this leeway is not absolute.

S. 402, the Court said that a reviewing court\nshould take into account whether the agency had \u201crelied\non factors which Congress has not intended it to consider,\nentirely failed to consider an important aspect of the\nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs\ncounter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implau\u00ad\nsible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or\nthe product of agency expertise.\u201d State Farm, supra, at 43;\nsee also Overton Park, supra, at 416.\n                              II\n  We here must apply the general standards set forth in\nState Farm and Overton Park to an agency decision that\nchanges a 25-year-old \u201cfleeting expletive\u201d policy from (1)\nthe old policy that would normally permit broadcasters to\ntransmit a single, fleeting use of an expletive to (2) a new\npolicy that would threaten broadcasters with large fines\nfor transmitting even a single use (including its use by a\nmember of the public) of such an expletive, alone with\nnothing more. The question is whether that decision\nsatisfies the minimal standards necessary to assure a\nreviewing court that such a change of policy is not \u201carbi\u00ad\ntrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2)(A), particularly as set forth in, e.g., State Farm\nand Overton Park, supra, at 2\u20137. The decision, in my\nview, does not satisfy those standards.\n  Consider the requirement that an agency at least mini\u00ad\nmally \u201cconsider . . . important aspect[s] of the problem.\u201d\nState Farm, supra, at 43. The FCC failed to satisfy this\nrequirement, for it failed to consider two critically impor\u00ad\ntant aspects of the problem that underlay its initial policy\njudgment (one of which directly, the other of which indi\u00ad\nrectly). First, the FCC said next to nothing about the\nrelation between the change it made in its prior \u201cfleeting\nexpletive\u201d policy and the First-Amendment-related need to\n8          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\navoid \u201ccensorship,\u201d a matter as closely related to broad\u00ad\ncasting regulation as is health to that of the environment.\nThe reason that discussion of the matter is particularly\nimportant here is that the FCC had explicitly rested its\nprior policy in large part upon the need to avoid treading\ntoo close to the constitutional line.\n    Thirty years ago, the Court considered the location of\nthat constitutional line. In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,\n438 U. S. 726 (1978), the Court reviewed an FCC decision\nforbidding the broadcast of a monologue that deliberately\nand repeatedly uttered the expletives here at issue more\nthan 100 times in one hour at a time of day when children\nwere likely to hear the broadcast. Id., at 739. The Court\nheld that the FCC\u2019s prohibition did not violate the First\nAmendment. But the Court divided 5 to 4. And two Mem\u00ad\nbers of the majority, Justices Powell and Blackmun, ex\u00ad\nplicitly noted that the Court \u201cdoes not speak to cases\ninvolving the isolated use of a potentially offensive word\n. . . as distinguished from the verbal shock treatment\nadministered by respondent here.\u201d Id., at 760\u2013761 (Pow\u00ad\nell, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\n(emphasis added). This statement by two Members of the\nmajority suggested that they could reach a different re\u00ad\nsult, finding an FCC prohibition unconstitutional, were\nthat prohibition aimed at the fleeting or single use of an\nexpletive.\n    The FCC subsequently made clear that it thought that\nJustice Powell\u2019s concurrence set forth a constitutional line\nthat its indecency policy should embody. In 1978, the\nCommission wrote that the First Amendment \u201cseverely\nlimit[s]\u201d the Commission\u2019s role in regulating indecency. It\nadded that the Court, in Pacifica, had \u201crelied . . . on the\nrepetitive occurrence of the \u2018indecent\u2019 words in question.\u201d\nAnd it said that, in setting policy, it \u201cintend[ed] strictly to\nobserve the narrowness of the Pacifica holding.\u201d In re\nApplication of WGBH Educ.

C. C. 2d\n750, 760, \u00b6\u00b617\u201318. In 1987, the Commission once more\nexplained that its \u201cfleeting expletives\u201d policy reflected the\nCourt\u2019s decision in Pacifica. It said that, under its policy,\n\u201cspeech that is indecent must involve more than an iso\u00ad\nlated use of an offensive word,\u201d adding that \u201cwe believe\nthat under the legal standards set forth in Pacifica, delib\u00ad\nerate and repetitive use in a patently offensive manner is\na requisite to a finding of indecency.\u201d In re Pacifica Foun\ndation, 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699, \u00b613 (emphasis added). In\nanother order that same year, the Commission stated that\n\u201cthe First Amendment dicate[s] a careful and restrained\napproach with regard to review of matters involving\nbroadcast programming\u201d; it then explained, citing\nPacifica, that \u201c[s]peech that is indecent must involve more\nthan the isolated use of an offensive word.\u201d In re Infinity\nBroadcasting, 2 FCC Rcd. 2705, 2705, \u00b6\u00b66\u20137 (1987) (em\u00ad\nphasis added). And in 2001, in giving the industry guid\u00ad\nance, the FCC once again said in respect to its regulation\nof indecent speech that it \u201cmust both identify a compelling\ninterest for any regulation . . . and choose the least restric\u00ad\ntive means to further that interest.\u201d In re Industry Guid\nance On Commission\u2019s Case Law Interpreting 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast\nIndecency, 16 FCC Rcd. 7999, 8000\u20138001, \u00b63\u20135.\n   The FCC thus repeatedly made clear that it based its\n\u201cfleeting expletive\u201d policy upon the need to avoid treading\ntoo close to the constitutional line as set forth in Justice\nPowell\u2019s Pacifica concurrence. What then did it say, when\n10         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nit changed its policy, about why it abandoned this Consti\u00ad\ntution-based reasoning? The FCC devoted \u201cfour full pages\nof small-type, single-spaced text,\u201d ante, at 23, responding\nto industry arguments that, e.g., changes in the nature of\nthe broadcast industry made all indecency regulation, i.e.,\n18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, unconstitutional. In doing so it repeat\u00ad\nedly reaffirmed its view that Pacifica remains good law.\nIn re Complaints Regarding Various Television Broadcasts\nBetween February 2, 2002, and March, 8, 2008, 21 FCC\nRcd. 13299, 13317\u201313321, \u00b6\u00b642\u201352 (2006) (Remand Or\nder). All the more surprising then that, in respect to why\nit abandoned its prior view about the critical relation\nbetween its prior fleeting expletive policy and Justice\nPowell\u2019s Pacifica concurrence, it says no more than the\nfollowing:\n   \u201c[O]ur decision is not inconsistent with the Supreme\nCourt ruling in Pacifica. The Court explicitly left open the\nissue of whether an occasional expletive could be consid\u00ad\nered indecent.\u201d In re Complaints Against Various Broad\ncast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \u201cGolden Globe\nAwards\u201d Program, 19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4982, \u00b616 (2004)\n(Golden Globe Order). And, (repeating what it already\nhad said), \u201c[Pacifica] specifically reserved the question of\n\u2018an occasional expletive\u2019 and noted that it addressed only\nthe \u2018particular broadcast\u2019 at issue in that case.\u201d Remand\nOrder, supra, at 13308\u201313309, \u00b624.\n   These two sentences are not a summary of the FCC\u2019s\ndiscussion about why it abandoned its prior understanding\nof Pacifica.

The result is not simply Hamlet\nwithout the prince, but Hamlet with a prince who, in mid\u00ad\nplay and without explanation, just disappears.\n    I have found one other related reference to Pacifica, but\nthat reference occurs in an opinion written by a dissenting\nCommissioner. That dissenter said that the FCC had\n\u201c \u2018fail[ed] to address the many serious [constitutional]\nconcerns raised\u2019 \u201d by the new policy, while adding that the\nnew policy was \u201cnot the restrained enforcement policy\nencouraged by the Supreme Court in Pacifica.\u201d Remand\nOrder, supra, at 13331, 13334. Neither that Commis\u00ad\nsioner in his dissent, nor I in this dissent, claim that\nagencies must always take account of possible constitu\u00ad\ntional issues when they formulate policy. Cf. ante, at 12.\nBut the FCC works in the shadow of the First Amendment\nand its view of the application of that Amendment to\n\u201cfleeting expletives\u201d directly informed its initial policy\nchoice. Under these circumstances, the FCC\u2019s failure to\naddress this \u201caspect\u201d of the problem calls for a remand to\nthe agency. Overton Park, 401 U. S., at 420\u2013421.\n    Second, the FCC failed to consider the potential impact\nof its new policy upon local broadcasting coverage. This\n\u201caspect of the problem\u201d is particularly important because\nthe FCC explicitly took account of potential broadcasting\nimpact. Golden Globe Order, supra, at 4980, \u00b611 (\u201cThe\nease with which broadcasters today can block even fleeting\nwords in a live broadcast is an element in our decision\u201d).\nIndeed, in setting forth \u201cbleeping\u201d technology changes\n(presumably lowering bleeping costs) as justifying the\npolicy change, it implicitly reasoned that lower costs,\nmaking it easier for broadcasters to install bleeping\nequipment, made it less likely that the new policy would\nlead broadcasters to reduce coverage, say by canceling\ncoverage of public events. Ibid. (\u201c[T]echnological advances\n12         FCC v.

It said nothing at all.\n    The FCC cannot claim that local coverage lacks special\nimportance. To the contrary, \u201cthe concept of localism has\nbeen a cornerstone of broadcast regulation for decades.\u201d\nIn re Broadcast Localism, 23 FCC Rcd. 1324, 1326, 1327,\n\u00b6\u00b63, 5 (2008). That policy seeks to provide \u201cviewers and\nlisteners . . . access to locally responsive programming\nincluding, but not limited to, local news and public affairs\nmatter\u201d and to ensure \u201cdiversity in what is seen and heard\nover the airwaves.\u201d That policy has long favored local\nbroadcasting, both as a means to increase coverage of local\nevents and, insofar as it increases the number of broadcast\nvoices, as an end in itself. See, e.g., In re Reexamination of\nComparative Standards for Noncommercial Educ. Appli\ncants, 15 FCC Rcd. 7386, 7399, \u00b629 (2000) (adopting a\nsystem for selecting applicants for broadcast channels that\n\u201cwould foster our goal of broadcast diversity by enabling\nthe local public to be served by differing . . . licensees\u201d); In\nre 2002 Biennial Regulatory Review, 18 FCC Rcd. 13620,\n13644, \u00b6\u00b677, 79 (2003) (\u201cWe remain firmly committed to\nthe policy of promoting localism among broadcast outlets.\n. . .

Ante, at 24\u201325.\nThe plurality's \u201cdoubt[s]\u201d rest upon its views (1) that\nvulgar expression is less prevalent (at least among broad\u00ad\ncast guests) in smaller towns, ante, at 24; (2) that the\ngreatest risk the new policy poses for \u201csmall-town broad\u00ad\ncasters\u201d arises when they broadcast local \u201cnews and public\naffairs,\u201d ibid., and (3) that the Remand Order says \u201clittle\nabout how the Commission would treat smaller broadcast\u00ad\ners who cannot afford screening equipment,\u201d while also\npointing out that the new policy \u201c \u2018does not . . . impose\nundue burdens on broadcasters\u2019 \u201d and emphasizing that\nthe case before it did not involve \u201c \u2018breaking news.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 24\u201325.\n   As to the first point, about the prevalence of vulgarity in\nsmall towns, I confess ignorance. But I do know that there\nare independent stations in many large and medium sized\ncities. See Television & Cable Factbook, Directory of\nTelevision Stations in Operation 2008. As to the second\npoint, I too believe that coverage of local public events, if\nnot news, lies at the heart of the problem.\n   I cannot agree with the plurality, however, about the\ncritical third point, namely that the new policy obviously\nprovides smaller independent broadcasters with adequate\nassurance that they will not be fined. The new policy\nremoves the \u201cfleeting expletive\u201d exception, an exception\nthat assured smaller independent stations that they would\nnot be fined should someone swear at a public event. In\nits place, it puts a policy that places all broadcasters at\nrisk when they broadcast fleeting expletives, including\nexpletives uttered at public events. The Remand Order\nsays that there \u201cis no outright news exemption from our\nindecency rules.\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13327, \u00b671 (emphasis\nadded).

It does list those circumstances as\nincluding the \u201cpossibility of human error in using delay\nequipment.\u201d Id., at 13313, \u00b635. But it says nothing about\na station\u2019s inability to afford delay equipment (a matter\nthat in individual cases could itself prove debatable). All\nthe FCC had to do was to consider this matter and either\ngrant an exemption or explain why it did not grant an\nexemption. But it did not. And the result is a rule that\nmay well chill coverage\u2014the kind of consequence that the\nlaw has considered important for decades, to which the\nbroadcasters pointed in their arguments before the FCC,\nand which the FCC nowhere discusses. See, e.g., Dom\nbrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 494 (1965) (\u201cSo long as\nthe statute remains available to the State the threat of\nprosecutions of protected expression is a real and substan\u00ad\ntial one. Even the prospect of ultimate failure of such\nprosecutions by no means dispels their chilling effect on\nprotected expression\u201d); see also Ashcroft v. Free Speech\nCoalition, 535 U.

C. \u00a7553, the two failures\nI have just discussed would clearly require a court to\nvacate the resulting agency decision. See ACLU v.

Here the agency did not make\nnew policy through the medium of notice and comment\nproceedings. But the same failures here\u2014where the policy\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             17\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nis important, the significance of the issues clear, the fail\u00ad\nures near complete\u2014should lead us to the same conclu\u00ad\nsion. The agency\u2019s failure to discuss these two \u201cimportant\naspect[s] of the problem\u201d means that the resulting decision\nis \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d requiring\nus to remand the matter to the agency. State Farm, 463\nU. S., at 43; Overton Park, 401 U. S., at 416.\n                              III\n   The three reasons the FCC did set forth in support of its\nchange of policy cannot make up for the failures I have\ndiscussed. Consider each of them. First, as I have pointed\nout, the FCC based its decision in part upon the fact that\n\u201cbleeping/delay systems\u201d technology has advanced. I have\nalready set forth my reasons for believing that that fact,\nwithout more, cannot provide a sufficient justification for\nits policy change. Supra, at 11\u201316.\n   Second, the FCC says that the expletives here in ques\u00ad\ntion always invoke a coarse excretory or sexual image;\nhence it makes no sense to distinguish between whether\none uses the relevant terms as an expletive or as a literal\ndescription. The problem with this answer is that it does\nnot help to justify the change in policy. The FCC was\naware of the coarseness of the \u201cimage\u201d the first time\naround. See, e.g., Remand Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308,\n\u00b623 (asserting that FCC has always understood the words\nas coarse and indecent). And it explained the first time\naround why it nonetheless distinguished between their\nliteral use and their use as fleeting expletives. See, e.g., In\nre Application of WGBH Educ. Foundation, 69 F. C. C. 2d,\nat 1254\u20131255, \u00b6\u00b610\u201311 (discussing First Amendment\nconsiderations and related need to avoid reduced broad\u00ad\ncast coverage). Simply to announce that the words,\nwhether used descriptively or as expletives, call forth\nsimilar \u201cimages\u201d is not to address those reasons.\n   Third, the FCC said that \u201cperhaps\u201d its \u201cmost impor\u00ad\n18         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntan[t]\u201d justification for the new policy lay in the fact that\nits new \u201ccontextual\u201d approach to fleeting expletives is\nbetter and more \u201c[c]onsistent with\u201d the agency\u2019s \u201cgeneral\napproach to indecency\u201d than was its previous \u201ccate\u00ad\ngorica[l]\u201d approach, which offered broadcasters virtual\nimmunity for the broadcast of fleeting expletives. Remand\nOrder, supra, at 13308, \u00b623. This justification, however,\noffers no support for the change without an understanding\nof why, i.e., in what way, the FCC considered the new\napproach better or more consistent with the agency\u2019s\ngeneral approach.\n   The Solicitor General sets forth one way in which the\nnew policy might be more consistent with statutory policy.\nThe indecency statute prohibits the broadcast of \u201cany . . .\nindecent . . . language.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464. The very point\nof the statute, he says, is to eliminate nuisance; and the\nuse of expletives, even once, can constitute such a nui\u00ad\nsance. The Solicitor General adds that the statutory word\n\u201cany\u201d indicates that Congress did not intend a safe-harbor\nfor a fleeting use of that language. Brief for Petitioners\n24\u201325. The fatal flaw in this argument, however, lies in\nthe fact that the Solicitor General and not the agency has\nmade it. We must consider the lawfulness of an agency\u2019s\ndecision on the basis of the reasons the agency gave, not\non the basis of those it might have given. SEC v. Chenery\nCorp., 332 U. S. 194, 196\u2013197 (1947); State Farm, supra,\nat 50. And the FCC did not make this claim. Hence, we\ncannot take it into account and need not evaluate its\nmerits.\n   In fact, the FCC found that the new policy was better in\npart because, in its view, the new policy better protects\nchildren against what it described as \u201c \u2018the first blow\u2019 \u201d of\nbroadcast indecency that results from the \u201c \u2018pervasive\u2019 \u201d\nnature of broadcast media. It wrote that its former policy\nof \u201cgranting an automatic exemption for \u2018isolated or fleet\u00ad\ning\u2019 expletives unfairly forces viewers (including children)\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto take \u2018the first blow.\u2019 \u201d Remand Order, supra, at 13309,\n\u00b625.\n   The difficulty with this argument, however, is that it\ndoes not explain the change. The FCC has long used the\ntheory of the \u201cfirst blow\u201d to justify its regulation of broad\u00ad\ncast indecency. See, e.g., In re Enforcement of Prohibitions\nAgainst Broadcast Indecency in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, 5 FCC\nRcd. 5297, 5302, \u00b6\u00b634\u201335 (1990). Yet the FCC has also\nlong followed its original \u201cfleeting expletives\u201d policy. Nor\nwas the FCC ever unaware of the fact to which the major\u00ad\nity points, namely that children\u2019s surroundings influence\ntheir behavior. See, e.g., In re Enforcement of Prohibitions\nAgainst Broadcast Indecency in 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464, 8 FCC\nRcd. 704, 706, \u00b611 (1993). So, to repeat the question:\nWhat, in respect to the \u201cfirst blow,\u201d has changed?\n   The FCC points to no empirical (or other) evidence to\ndemonstrate that it previously understated the impor\u00ad\ntance of avoiding the \u201cfirst blow.\u201d Like the majority, I do\nnot believe that an agency must always conduct full em\u00ad\npirical studies of such matters. Ante, at 15\u201316. But the\nFCC could have referred to, and explained, relevant em\u00ad\npirical studies that suggest the contrary. One review of\nthe empirical evidence, for example, reports that \u201c[i]t is\ndoubtful that children under the age of 12 understand\nsexual language and innuendo; therefore it is unlikely that\nvulgarities have any negative effect.\u201d Kaye & Sapolsky,\nWatch Your Mouth! An Analysis of Profanity Uttered by\nChildren on Prime-Time Television, 2004 Mass Communi\u00ad\ncation & Soc\u2019y 429, 433 (Vol. 7) (citing two studies). The\nCommission need not have accepted this conclusion. But\nits failure to discuss this or any other such evidence, while\nproviding no empirical evidence at all that favors its posi\u00ad\ntion, must weaken the logical force of its conclusion. See\nState Farm, 463 U. S., at 43 (explaining that an agency\u2019s\nfailure to \u201cexamine the relevant data\u201d is a factor in deter\u00ad\nmining whether the decision is \u201carbitrary\u201d).\n20         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The FCC also found the new policy better because it\nbelieved that its prior policy \u201cwould as a matter of logic\npermit broadcasters to air expletives at all hours of a day\nso long as they did so one at a time.\u201d Remand Order, 21\nFCC Rcd., at 13309, \u00b625. This statement, however, raises\nan obvious question: Did that happen? The FCC\u2019s initial\n\u201cfleeting expletives\u201d policy was in effect for 25 years. Had\nbroadcasters during those 25 years aired a series of exple\u00ad\ntives \u201cone at a time?\u201d If so, it should not be difficult to find\nevidence of that fact. But the FCC refers to none. Indeed,\nthe FCC did not even claim that a change had taken place\nin this respect. It spoke only of the pure \u201clogic\u201d of the\ninitial policy \u201cpermitting\u201d such a practice. That logic\nwould have been apparent to anyone, including the FCC,\nin 1978 when the FCC set forth its initial policy.\n   Finally, the FCC made certain statements that suggest\nit did not believe it was changing prior policy in any major\nway. It referred to that prior policy as based on \u201cstaff\nletters and dicta\u201d and it said that at least one of the in\u00ad\nstances before it (namely, the Cher broadcast) would have\nbeen actionably indecent under that prior policy. Id., at\n13306\u201313307, 13324, \u00b6\u00b620\u201321, 60. As we all agree, how\u00ad\never, in fact the FCC did change its policy in a major way.\nSee ante, at 13. To the extent that the FCC minimized\nthat fact when considering the change, it did not fully\nfocus on the fact of change. And any such failure would\nmake its decision still less supportable. See National\nCable, 545 U. S., at 981.\n                             IV\n   Were the question a closer one, the doctrine of constitu\u00ad\ntional avoidance would nonetheless lead me to remand the\ncase. See United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394,\n401 (1916) (\u201cA statute must be construed, if fairly possible,\nso as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitu\u00ad\ntional but also grave doubts upon that score\u201d (emphasis\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nadded)). That doctrine seeks to avoid unnecessary judicial\nconsideration of constitutional questions, assumes that\nCongress, no less than the Judicial Branch, seeks to act\nwithin constitutional bounds, and thereby diminishes the\nfriction between the branches that judicial holdings of\nunconstitutionality might otherwise generate. See Al\nmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 237\u2013238\n(1998); see also Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.\nv. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 172\u2013173 (2001);\nEdward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building\n& Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988); Res\ncue Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, 331 U. S. 549,\n571 (1947); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 345\u2013348\n(1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). The doctrine assumes\nthat Congress would prefer a less-than-optimal interpreta\u00ad\ntion of its statute to the grave risk of a constitutional\nholding that would set the statute entirely aside. See\nAlmendarez-Torres, supra, at 238 (construction of statute\nthat avoids invalidation best reflects congressional will);\ncf. United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 249, 267 (2005).\n   Unlike the majority, I can find no convincing reason for\nrefusing to apply a similar doctrine here. The Court has\noften applied that doctrine where an agency\u2019s regulation\nrelies on a plausible but constitutionally suspect interpre\u00ad\ntation of a statute. See, e.g., Solid Waste Agency, supra, at\n172\u2013174; NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S.\n490, 506\u2013507 (1979). The values the doctrine serves apply\nwhether the agency\u2019s decision does, or does not, rest upon\na constitutionally suspect interpretation of a statute. And\na remand here would do no more than ask the agency to\nreconsider its policy decision in light of the concerns raised\nin a judicial opinion. Cf. Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S.\n448, 551 (1980) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (a holding that a\ncongressional action implicating the Equal Protection\nClause \u201cwas not adequately preceded by a consideration of\nless drastic alternatives or adequately explained by a\n22         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nstatement of legislative purpose would be far less intru\u00ad\nsive than a final determination that the substance of\u201d that\naction was unconstitutional). I would not now foreclose, as\nthe majority forecloses, our further consideration of this\nmatter. (Of course, nothing in the Court\u2019s decision today\nprevents the Commission from reconsidering its current\npolicy in light of potential constitutional considerations or\nfor other reasons.)\n                              V\n   In sum, the FCC\u2019s explanation of its change leaves out\ntwo critically important matters underlying its earlier\npolicy, namely Pacifica and local broadcasting coverage.\nIts explanation rests upon three considerations previously\nknown to the agency (\u201ccoarseness,\u201d the \u201cfirst blow,\u201d and\nrunning single expletives all day, one at a time). With one\nexception, it provides no empirical or other information\nexplaining why those considerations, which did not justify\nits new policy before, justify it now. Its discussion of the\none exception (technological advances in bleeping/delay\nsystems), failing to take account of local broadcast cover\u00ad\nage, is seriously incomplete.\n   I need not decide whether one or two of these features,\nstanding alone, would require us to remand the case.\nHere all come together. And taken together they suggest\nthat the FCC\u2019s answer to the question, \u201cWhy change?\u201d is,\n\u201cWe like the new policy better.\u201d This kind of answer,\nmight be perfectly satisfactory were it given by an elected\nofficial. But when given by an agency, in respect to a\nmajor change of an important policy where much more\nmight be said, it is not sufficient. State Farm, 463 U. S.,\nat 41\u201342.\n   For these reasons I would find the FCC\u2019s decision \u201carbi\u00ad\ntrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion,\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7706(2)(A), requiring remand of this case to the FCC. And\nI would affirm the Second Circuit\u2019s similar determination.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n</pre>",
