Argued December 8, 2008\u2014Decided April 21, 2009*\nAs part of the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) statutory duty to\n  help a veteran develop a benefits claim, the Secretary of Veterans Af\n  fairs (Secretary) must notify an applicant of any information or evi\n  dence that is necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 U. S. C.\n  \u00a75103(a). VA regulations require the notice to specify (1) what fur\n  ther information is necessary, (2) what portions of that information\n  the VA will obtain, and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.\n  These requirements are referred to as Type One, Type Two, and Type\n  Three, respectively.\n     The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), which\n  hears initial appeals from VA claims decisions, has a statutory duty\n  to \u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\u201d \u00a77261(b)(2). It\n  has developed a system for dealing with notice errors, whereby a\n  claimant arguing that the VA failed to give proper notice must ex\n  plain precisely how the notice was defective. The reviewing judge\n  will then decide what \u201ctype\u201d of notice error the VA committed. Under\n  the Veterans Court\u2019s approach, a Type One error has the \u201cnatural ef\n  fect\u201d of harming the claimant, but Types Two and Three errors do\n  not. In the latter instances, the claimant must show harm, e.g., by\n  describing what evidence he would have provided (or asked the Sec\n  retary to provide) had the notice not been defective, and explaining\n  just how the lack of that notice and evidence affected the adjudica\n  tion\u2019s essential fairness.\n     The Federal Circuit, which reviews Veterans Court decisions, re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs v. Simmons,\nalso on certiorari to the same court (see this Court\u2019s Rule 12.4).\n2                        SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jected the Veterans Court\u2019s approach and set forth its own framework\n    for determining whether a notice error is harmless. When the VA\n    provides a claimant with a notice that is deficient in any respect, the\n    framework requires the Veterans Court to presume that the error is\n    prejudicial and requires reversal unless the VA can demonstrate (1)\n    that the defect was cured by the claimant\u2019s actual knowledge or (2)\n    that benefits could not have been awarded as a matter of law. The\n    Federal Circuit applied its framework in both of the present cases.\n       In respondent Sanders\u2019 case, the VA denied disability benefits on\n    the ground that Sanders\u2019 disability, blindness in his right eye, was\n    not related to his military service. Sanders argued to the Veterans\n    Court that the VA had made notice errors Type Two and Type Three\n    when it informed him what further information was necessary, but\n    failed to tell him which portions of that information the Secretary\n    would provide and which portions he would have to provide. The\n    Veterans Court held these notice errors harmless, but the Federal\n    Circuit reversed, ruling that the VA had not made the necessary\n    claimant-knowledge or benefits-ineligibilty showing required by the\n    Federal Circuit\u2019s framework.\n       The VA also denied benefits in respondent Simmons\u2019 case after\n    finding that her left-ear hearing loss, while service connected, was\n    not severe enough to warrant compensation. Simmons argued to the\n    Veterans Court, inter alia, that the VA had made a Type One notice\n    error by failing to notify her of the information necessary to show\n    worsening of her hearing. The court agreed, finding the error preju\n    dicial. Noting that a Type One notice error has the \u201cnatural effect\u201d of\n    producing prejudice, the Veterans Court added that its review of the\n    record convinced it that Simmons did not have actual knowledge of\n    what evidence was necessary to substantiate her claim and, had the\n    VA told her more specifically what additional information was\n    needed, she might have obtained that evidence. The Federal Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s harmless-error framework conflicts with\n \u00a77261(b)(2)\u2019s requirement that the Veterans Court take \u201cdue account\n of the rule of prejudicial error.\u201d Pp. 8\u201315.\n       (a) That \u00a77261(b)(2) requires the same sort of \u201charmless-error\u201d\n rule as is ordinarily applied in civil cases is shown by the statutory\n words \u201ctake due account\u201d and \u201cprejudicial error.\u201d Congress used the\n same words in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.

See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760. Second, the\nframework imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden on the VA,\nrequiring the Secretary to demonstrate, e.g., a claimant\u2019s state of\nmind about what he knew or the nonexistence of evidence that might\nsignificantly help the claimant. Third, the framework requires the\nVA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless. The bur\nden of showing harmfulness is normally on the party attacking an\nagency\u2019s determination. See, e.g., Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109,\n116. This Court has placed the burden on the Government only when\nthe underlying matter was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos, supra, at\n760. The good reasons for this rule do not apply in the ordinary civil\ncase. Pp. 9\u201313.\n      (c) The foregoing analysis is subject to two important qualifica\ntions. First, the Court need not, and does not, decide the lawfulness\nof the Veterans Court\u2019s reliance on the \u201cnatural effects\u201d of certain\nkinds of notice errors. Second, although Congress\u2019 special solicitude\nfor veterans might lead a reviewing court to consider harmful in a\nveteran\u2019s case error that it might consider harmless in other cases,\nthat is not at issue, and need not be decided here. Pp. 13\u201315.\n   2. In Sanders\u2019 case, a review of the record demonstrates that the\nVeterans Court lawfully found the notice errors harmless. The VA\u2019s\nTypes Two and Three notice errors did not matter, given that Sand\ners has pursued his claim for many years and should be aware of why\nhe has been unable to show that his disability is service connected.\nSanders has not told the reviewing courts what additional evidence\nproper notice would have led him to obtain or seek and has not ex\nplained how the notice errors could have made any difference.\n   In Simmons\u2019 case, some features of the record suggest that the VA\u2019s\nType One error was harmless, e.g., that she has long sought benefits\nand has a long history of medical examinations. But other features,\ne.g., that her left-ear hearing loss was concededly service connected\nand has continuously deteriorated over time, suggest the opposite.\nGiven the uncertainties, the Veterans Court should decide whether\nreconsideration is necessary.

SIMMONS \n\nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                                 [April 21, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In these two civil cases, the Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA) denied veterans\u2019 claims for disability benefits.\nIn both cases the VA erroneously failed to provide the\nveteran with a certain kind of statutorily required notice.\nSee 38 U. S. C. \u00a75103(a). In both cases the VA argued that\nthe error was harmless. And in both cases the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, after setting forth a\nframework for determining whether a notice error is\nharmless, rejected the VA\u2019s argument.\n  In our view, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201charmless-error\u201d\nframework is too complex and rigid, its presumptions\nimpose unreasonable evidentiary burdens upon the VA,\nand it is too likely too often to require the Court of Appeals\nfor Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) to treat as harmful\nerrors that in fact are harmless. We conclude that the\nframework conflicts with established law. See \u00a77261(b)(2)\n(Veterans Court must \u201ctake due account of the rule of\nprejudicial error\u201d).\n2                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   The law entitles veterans who have served on active\nduty in the United States military to receive benefits for\ndisabilities caused or aggravated by their military service.\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the\nVA to help a veteran develop his or her benefits claim.\n\u00a75103A. In doing so, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n(Secretary), upon \u201creceipt of\u201d an \u201capplication\u201d for benefits,\nmust \u201cnotify the claimant . . . of any information, and any\nmedical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the\nSecretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.\u201d As\n\u201cpart of\u201d the required \u201cnotice,\u201d the Secretary must also\n\u201cindicate which portion of\u201d the required \u201cinformation and\nevidence . . . is to be provided by the claimant and which\nportion . . . the Secretary . . . will attempt to obtain.\u201d\n\u00a75103(a).\n   Repeating these statutory requirements in its regula\ntions, the VA has said it will provide a claimant with a\nletter that tells the claimant (1) what further information\nis necessary to substantiate his or her claim; (2) what\nportions of that information the VA will obtain for the\nclaimant; and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.\n38 CFR \u00a73.159(b) (2008). At the time of the decisions\nbelow, the regulations also required the VA to tell the\nclaimant (4) that he may submit any other relevant infor\nmation that he has available. \u00a73.159(b)(1). (The VA refers\nto these notice requirements as Type One, Type Two, Type\nThree, and Type Four, respectively.)\n                            B\n  The VA\u2019s regional offices decide most claims. A claim\nant may appeal an adverse regional office decision to the\nVA\u2019s Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, an administrative board\nwith the power to consider certain types of new evidence.\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n38 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77107(b), 7109(a); 38 CFR \u00a720.1304(c). The\nclaimant may seek review of an adverse Board decision in\nthe Veterans Court, an Article I court. And the claimant\n(or the Government) may appeal an adverse decision of the\nVeterans Court to the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit\u2014but only in respect to certain legal matters,\nnamely, \u201cthe validity . . . of any statute or regulation . . . or\nany interpretation thereof . . . that was relied on\u201d by the\nVeterans Court in making its decision. 38 U. S. C. \u00a77292.\n  A specific statute requires the Veterans Court to \u201ctake\ndue account of the rule of prejudicial error.\u201d \u00a77261(b)(2).\nIn applying this statutory provision, the Veterans Court\nhas developed its own special framework for notice errors.\nUnder this framework, a claimant who argues that the VA\nfailed to give proper notice must explain precisely how the\nnotice was defective. Then the reviewing judge will decide\nwhat \u201ctype\u201d of notice error the VA committed. The Veter\nans Court has gone on to say that a Type One error (i.e., a\nfailure to explain what further information is needed) has\nthe \u201cnatural effect\u201d of harming the claimant; but errors of\nTypes Two, Three, or Four (i.e., a failure to explain just\nwho, claimant or agency, must provide the needed mate\nrial or to tell the veteran that he may submit any other\nevidence available) do not have the \u201cnatural effect\u201d of\nharming the claimant. In these latter instances, the\nclaimant must show how the error caused harm, for ex\nample, by stating in particular just \u201cwhat evidence\u201d he\nwould have provided (or asked the Secretary to provide)\nhad the notice not been defective, and explaining just \u201chow\nthe lack of that notice and evidence affected the essential\nfairness of the adjudication.\u201d Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19\nVet. App. 103, 121 (2005).\n                           C\n  In the first case, Woodrow Sanders, a veteran of World\nWar II, claimed that a bazooka exploded near his face in\n4                   SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1944, causing later blindness in his right eye. His war\ntime medical records, however, did not indicate any eye\nproblems. Indeed, his 1945 discharge examination showed\nnear-perfect vision. But a 1948 eye examination revealed\nan inflammation of the right-eye retina and surrounding\ntissues\u2014a condition that eventually left him nearly blind\nin that eye. Soon after the examination Sanders filed a\nclaim for disability benefits. But in 1949 the VA denied\nbenefits on the ground that Sanders had failed to show a\nconnection between his eye condition and his earlier mili\ntary service.\n   Forty-two years later, Sanders asked the VA to reopen\nhis benefits claim. He argued that the 1944 bazooka\nexplosion had hurt his eye, and added that that he had\nbegun to experience symptoms\u2014blurred vision, swelling,\nand loss of sight\u2014in 1946. He included a report from a\nVA doctor, Dr. Joseph Ruda, who said that \u201c[i]t is not\ninconceivable that\u201d the condition \u201ccould have occurred\nsecondary to trauma, as stated by\u201d Sanders. A private\nophthalmologist, Dr. Gregory Strainer, confirming that\nSanders\u2019 right retina was scarred, added that this \u201c[t]ype\nof . . . injury . . . can certainly be concussive in character.\u201d\nApp. C to Pet. for Cert. 26a\u201327a.\n   In 1992, the VA reopened Sanders\u2019 claim. Id., at 29a.\nAfter obtaining Sanders\u2019 military medical records, the VA\narranged for a further medical examination, this time by\nVA eye specialist Dr. Sheila Anderson. After examining\nSanders\u2019 medical history (including records of the exami\nnations made at the time of Sanders\u2019 enlistment and\ndischarge), Anderson agreed with the medical diagnosis\nbut concluded that Sanders\u2019 condition was not service\nrelated. Since Sanders\u2019 right-eye \u201cvisual acuity\u201d was\n\u201c20/20\u201d upon enlistment and \u201c20/25\u201d upon discharge, and\nhe had \u201creported decreased vision only 6 months prior\u201d to\nhis 1948 doctor\u2019s \u201cvisit,\u201d and since \u201cthere are no other\nsigns of ocular trauma,\u201d Anderson thought that Sanders\u2019\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncondition \u201cis most likely infectious in nature, although the\netiology at this point is impossible to determine.\u201d \u201cBased\non the documented records,\u201d she concluded, \u201cthe patient\ndid not lose vision while on active duty.\u201d The VA regional\noffice denied Sanders\u2019 claim. Ibid.\n   Sanders sought Board review, and in the meantime he\nobtained the opinion of another VA doctor, Dr. Duane Nii,\nwho said that the \u201cetiology of the patient\u2019s\u201d eye condition\n\u201cis . . . difficult to ascertain.\u201d He thought that \u201cit is possi\nble that\u201d the condition \u201ccould be related to\u201d a bazooka\nexplosion, though the \u201cpossibility of\u201d an infection \u201cas the\netiology . . . could also be entertained.\u201d Id., at 30a. The\nBoard concluded that Sanders had failed to show that the\neye injury was service connected. The Board said that it\nhad relied most heavily upon Anderson\u2019s report because,\nunlike other reports, it took account of Sanders\u2019 military\nmedical records documenting his eyesight at the time of\nhis enlistment and discharge. And the Board conse\nquently affirmed the regional office\u2019s denial of Sanders\u2019\nclaim.\n   Sanders then appealed to the Veterans Court. There he\nargued, among other things, that the VA had made a\nnotice error. Sanders conceded that the VA had sent him\na letter telling him (1) what further information was\nnecessary to substantiate his claim. But, he said, the VA\nletter did not tell him (2) which portions of the information\nthe Secretary would provide or (3) which portions he\nwould have to provide. That is to say, he complained\nabout notice errors Type Two and Type Three.\n   The Veterans Court held that these notice errors were\nharmless. It said that Sanders had not explained how he\nwould have acted differently, say, by identifying what\ndifferent evidence he would have produced or asked the\nSecretary to obtain for him, had he received proper notice.\nFinding no other error, the Veterans Court affirmed the\nBoard\u2019s decision.\n6                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             D\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed\nthe Veterans Court\u2019s decision and held that the Veterans\nCourt was wrong to find the notice error harmless. The\nFederal Circuit wrote that when the VA provides a claim\nant with a notice letter that is deficient in any respect (to\nthe point where a \u201creasonable person\u201d would not have read\nit as providing the necessary information), the Veterans\nCourt \u201cshould . . . presum[e]\u201d that the notice error is\n\u201cprejudicial, requiring reversal unless the VA can show\nthat the error did not affect the essential fairness of the\nadjudication.\u201d Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F. 3d 881, 889\n(2007). To make this latter showing, the court added, the\nVA must \u201cdemonstrate\u201d (1) that the \u201cdefect was cured by\nactual knowledge on the\u201d claimant\u2019s \u201cpart,\u201d or (2) \u201cthat a\nbenefit could not have been awarded as a matter of law.\u201d\nIbid. Because the VA had not made such a showing, the\nFederal Circuit reversed the Veterans Court\u2019s decision.\n                             E\n  In the second case before us, the claimant, Patricia\nSimmons, served on active military duty from December\n1978 to April 1980. While on duty she worked in a noisy\nenvironment close to aircraft; after three months she\nbegan to lose hearing in her left ear; and by the time she\nwas discharged, her left-ear hearing had become worse.\nSoon after her discharge, Simmons applied for disability\nbenefits. The VA regional office found her hearing loss\nwas service connected; but it also found the loss insuffi\nciently severe to warrant compensation. In November\n1980, it denied her claim.\n  In 1998, Simmons asked the VA to reopen her claim.\nShe provided medical examination records showing fur\nther loss of hearing in her left ear along with (what she\nconsidered related) loss of hearing in her right ear. The\nVA arranged for hearing examinations by VA doctors in\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1999, 2001, and 2002. The doctors measured her left-ear\nhearing loss, ranking it as moderate to severe; they also\nmeasured her right-ear hearing loss, ranking it as mild to\nmoderate. After comparing the results of the examina\ntions with a VA hearing-loss compensation schedule, the\nregional office concluded that Simmons\u2019 left-ear hearing\nloss, while service connected, was not severe enough to\nwarrant compensation. At the same time, the regional\noffice concluded that her right-ear hearing loss was nei\nther service connected nor sufficiently severe. Simmons\nappealed the decision to the Board, which affirmed the\nregional office\u2019s determination.\n   In 2003, Simmons appealed to the Veterans Court.\nAmong other things, she said that she had not received a\nnotice about (and she consequently failed to attend) a\nfurther right-ear medical examination that the VA later\ntold her it had arranged. She added that, in respect to her\nclaim for benefits for loss of hearing in her left ear, the VA\nhad made a Type One notice error (i.e., it had failed to tell\nher what further information was needed to substantiate\nher claim). Simmons conceded that she had received a\nletter from the VA. But the letter told her only what, in\ngeneral, a person had to do to show that a hearing injury\nwas service connected. It did not tell her anything about\nher specific problem, namely, what further information\nshe must provide to show a worsening of hearing in her\nleft ear, to the point where she could receive benefits.\n   The Veterans Court agreed with Simmons, and it found\nboth errors prejudicial. In respect to Simmons\u2019 left-ear\nhearing loss (the matter at issue here), it pointed out that\nit had earlier said (in Mayfield, 19 Vet. App., at 120\u2013124)\nthat a Type One notice error has the \u201cnatural effect of\nproducing prejudice.\u201d The court added that its \u201crevie[w]\n[of] the record in its entirety\u201d convinced it that Simmons\ndid not have \u201cactual knowledge of what evidence was\nnecessary to substantiate her claim\u201d and, had the VA told\n8                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSimmons more specifically about what additional medical\ninformation it needed, Simmons might have \u201cobtained\u201d a\nfurther \u201cprivate\u201d medical \u201cexamination substantiating her\nclaim.\u201d App. G to Pet. for Cert. 81a. The Veterans Court\nconsequently remanded the case to the Board.\n  The Government appealed the Veterans Court\u2019s deter\nmination to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nAnd that court affirmed the Veterans Court\u2019s decision on\nthe basis of its decision in Sanders. Simmons v. Nichol\nson, 487 F. 3d 892 (2007).\n                             F\n  We granted certiorari in both Sanders\u2019 and Simmons\u2019\ncases in order to determine the lawfulness of the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s \u201charmless-error\u201d holdings.\n                             II\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s holdings flow directly from its use\nof the \u201charmless-error\u201d framework that we have described.\nSupra, at 6. Thus we must decide whether that frame\nwork is consistent with a particular statutory require\nment, namely, the requirement that the Veterans Court\n\u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error,\u201d\n38 U. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2). See supra, at 3. We conclude\nthat the framework is not consistent with the statutory\ndemand.\n                             A\n  We believe that the statute, in stating that the Veterans\nCourt must \u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial\nerror,\u201d requires the Veterans Court to apply the same kind\nof \u201charmless-error\u201d rule that courts ordinarily apply in\ncivil cases. The statutory words \u201ctake due account\u201d and\n\u201cprejudicial error\u201d make clear that is so. Congress used\nthe same words in the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA). 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706 (\u201c[A] court shall review the whole\nrecord . . . and due account shall be taken of the rule of\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the\nAdministrative Procedure Act explained that the APA\u2019s\nreference to \u201cprejudicial error\u201d is intended to \u201csu[m] up in\nsuccinct fashion the \u2018harmless error\u2019 rule applied by the\ncourts in the review of lower court decisions as well as of\nadministrative bodies.\u201d Dept. of Justice, Attorney Gen\neral\u2019s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 110\n(1947) (emphasis added). And we have previously de\nscribed \u00a7706 as an \u201c \u2018administrative law . . . harmless error\nrule.\u2019 \u201d National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nPDK Labs. Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement\nAdmin., 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004)). Legislative\nhistory confirms that Congress intended the Veterans\nCourt \u201cprejudicial error\u201d statute to \u201cincorporate a refer\nence\u201d to the APA\u2019s approach. S. Rep. No. 100\u2013418, p. 61\n(1988). We have no indication of any relevant distinction\nbetween the manner in which reviewing courts treat civil\nand administrative cases. Consequently, we assess the\nlawfulness of the Federal Circuit\u2019s approach in light of our\ngeneral case law governing application of the harmless\nerror standard.\n                            B\n  Three related features of the Federal Circuit\u2019s frame\nwork, taken together, convince us that it mandates an\napproach to harmless error that differs significantly from\nthe approach courts normally take in ordinary civil cases.\nFirst, the framework is complex, rigid, and mandatory. In\nevery case involving a notice error (of no matter which\nkind) the Veterans Court must find the error harmful\nunless the VA \u201cdemonstrate[s]\u201d (1) that the claimant\u2019s\n\u201cactual knowledge\u201d cured the defect or (2) that the claim\nant could not have received a benefit as a matter of law.\nSuppose the notice error, as in Sanders\u2019 case, consisted of\na failure to describe what additional information, if any,\n10                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe VA would provide. It might be obvious from the record\nin the particular case that the error made no difference.\nBut under the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule, the Veterans Court\nwould have to remand the case for new proceedings\nregardless.\n   We have previously warned against courts\u2019 determining\nwhether an error is harmless through the use of manda\ntory presumptions and rigid rules rather than case-specific\napplication of judgment, based upon examination of the\nrecord. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760\n(1946). The federal \u201charmless-error\u201d statute, now codified\nat 28 U. S. C. \u00a72111, tells courts to review cases for errors\nof law \u201cwithout regard to errors\u201d that do not affect the\nparties\u2019 \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d That language seeks to\nprevent appellate courts from becoming \u201c \u2018 impregnable\ncitadels of technicality, \u2019 \u201d Kotteakos, 328 U. S., at 759. And\nwe have read it as expressing a congressional preference\nfor determining \u201charmless error\u201d without the use of pre\nsumptions insofar as those presumptions may lead courts\nto find an error harmful, when, in fact, in the particular\ncase before the court, it is not. See id., at 760; O\u2019Neal v.\nMcAninch, 513 U. S. 432, 436\u2013437 (1995); see also R.\nTraynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 26 (1970) (herein\nafter Traynor) (reviewing court normally should \u201cdeter\nmine whether the error affected the judgment . . . without\nbenefit of such aids as presumptions . . . that expedite fact\nfinding at trial \u201d).\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s presumptions exhibit the very\ncharacteristics that Congress sought to discourage. In the\ncases before us, they would prevent the reviewing court\nfrom directly asking the harmless-error question. They\nwould prevent that court from resting its conclusion on the\nfacts and circumstances of the particular case. And they\nwould require the reviewing court to find the notice error\nprejudicial even if that court, having read the entire re\ncord, conscientiously concludes the contrary.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, the Federal Circuit\u2019s framework imposes an\nunreasonable evidentiary burden upon the VA. How is the\nSecretary to demonstrate, in Sanders\u2019 case for example,\nthat Sanders knew that he, not the VA, would have to\nproduce more convincing evidence that the bazooka acci\ndent caused his eye injury? How could the Secretary\ndemonstrate that there is no evidence anywhere that\nwould entitle Sanders to benefits? To show a claimant\u2019s\nstate of mind about such a matter will often prove diffi\ncult, perhaps impossible. And even if the VA (as in Sand\ners\u2019 case) searches the military records and comes up\nemptyhanded, it may still prove difficult, or impossible, to\nprove the nonexistence of evidence lying somewhere about\nthat might significantly help the claimant.\n   We have previously pointed out that setting an eviden\ntiary \u201cbarrier so high that it could never be surmounted\nwould justify the very criticism that spawned the harm\nless-error doctrine,\u201d namely, reversing for error \u201c \u2018regard\nless of its effect on the judgment.\u2019 \u201d Neder v. United States,\n527 U. S. 1, 18 (1999) (quoting Traynor 50). The Federal\nCircuit\u2019s evidentiary rules increase the likelihood of rever\nsal in cases where, in fact, the error is harmless. And, as\nwe pointed out in Neder, that likelihood encourages abuse\nof the judicial process and diminishes the public\u2019s confi\ndence in the fair and effective operation of the judicial\nsystem. 527 U. S., at 18.\n   Third, the Federal Circuit\u2019s framework requires the VA,\nnot the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless.\nThis Court has said that the party that \u201cseeks to have a\njudgment set aside because of an erroneous ruling carries\nthe burden of showing that prejudice resulted.\u201d Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 116 (1943); see also Tipton v.\nSocony Mobil Oil Co., 375 U. S. 34, 36 (1963) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Borden Co., 347 U. S. 514, 516\u2013517\n(1954); cf. McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Green\nwood, 464 U. S. 548, 553 (1984); Market Street R. Co. v.\n12                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRailroad Comm\u2019n of Cal., 324 U. S. 548, 562 (1945) (find\ning error harmless \u201cin the absence of any showing of . . .\nprejudice\u201d).\n  Lower court cases make clear that courts have corre\nlated review of ordinary administrative proceedings to\nappellate review of civil cases in this respect. Conse\nquently, the burden of showing that an error is harmful\nnormally falls upon the party attacking the agency\u2019s de\ntermination. See, e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Depart\nment of Transp., 202 F. 3d 788, 797 (CA5 2000) (declining\nto remand where appellant failed to show that error in\nadministrative proceeding was harmful); Air Canada v.\nDepartment of Transp., 148 F. 3d 1142, 1156\u20131157 (CADC\n1998) (same); Nelson v. Apfel, 131 F. 3d 1228, 1236 (CA7\n1997) (same); Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F. 2d 735,\n740 (CA10 1993) (same); Camden v. Department of Labor,\n831 F. 2d 449, 451 (CA3 1987) (same); Panhandle Co-op\nAssn. v. EPA, 771 F. 2d 1149, 1153 (CA8 1985) (same);\nFrankfort v. FERC, 678 F. 2d 699, 708 (CA7 1982) (same);\nNLRB v. Seine & Line Fishermen, 374 F. 2d 974, 981 (CA9\n1967) (same).\n  To say that the claimant has the \u201cburden\u201d of showing\nthat an error was harmful is not to impose a complex\nsystem of \u201cburden shifting\u201d rules or a particularly onerous\nrequirement. In ordinary civil appeals, for example, the\nappellant will point to rulings by the trial judge that the\nappellant claims are erroneous, say, a ruling excluding\nfavorable evidence. Often the circumstances of the case\nwill make clear to the appellate judge that the ruling, if\nerroneous, was harmful and nothing further need be said.\nBut, if not, then the party seeking reversal normally must\nexplain why the erroneous ruling caused harm. If, for\nexample, the party seeking an affirmance makes a strong\nargument that the evidence on the point was overwhelm\ning regardless, it normally makes sense to ask the party\nseeking reversal to provide an explanation, say, by mar\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nshaling the facts and evidence showing the contrary. The\nparty seeking to reverse the result of a civil proceeding\nwill likely be in a position at least as good as, and often\nbetter than, the opposing party to explain how he has been\nhurt by an error. Cf. United States v. Fior D\u2019Italia, Inc.,\n536 U. S. 238, 256, n. 4 (2002) (SOUTER, J., dissenting).\n  Respondents urge the creation of a special rule for this\ncontext, placing upon the agency the burden of proving\nthat a notice error did not cause harm. But we have\nplaced such a burden on the appellee only when the mat\nter underlying review was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos,\n328 U. S., at 760. In criminal cases the Government seeks\nto deprive an individual of his liberty, thereby providing a\ngood reason to require the Government to explain why an\nerror should not upset the trial court\u2019s determination.\nAnd the fact that the Government must prove its case\nbeyond a reasonable doubt justifies a rule that makes it\nmore difficult for the reviewing court to find that an error\ndid not affect the outcome of a case. See United States v.\nOlano, 507 U. S. 725, 741 (1993) (stating that the Gov\nernment bears the \u201cburden of showing the absence of\nprejudice\u201d). But in the ordinary civil case that is not so.\nSee Palmer, supra, at 116.\n                              C\n  Our discussion above is subject to two important qualifi\ncations. First, we need not, and we do not, decide the\nlawfulness of the use by the Veterans Court of what it\ncalled the \u201cnatural effects\u201d of certain kinds of notice er\nrors. We have previously made clear that courts may\nsometimes make empirically based generalizations about\nwhat kinds of errors are likely, as a factual matter, to\nprove harmful. See Kotteakos, supra, at 760\u2013761 (review\ning courts may learn over time that the \u201c \u2018natural effect\u2019 \u201d\nof certain errors is \u201c \u2018to prejudice a litigant\u2019s substantial\nrights\u2019 \u201d (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 913, 65th Cong., 3d Sess.,\n14                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\np. 1 (1919))). And by drawing upon \u201cexperience\u201d that\nreveals some such \u201c \u2018natural effect,\u2019 \u201d a court might prop\nerly influence, though not control, future determinations.\nSee Kotteakos, supra, at 760\u2013761. We consider here,\nhowever, only the Federal Circuit\u2019s harmless-error frame\nwork. That framework, as we have said, is mandatory.\nAnd its presumptions are not based upon an effort to\ndetermine \u201cnatural effects.\u201d\n   Indeed, the Federal Circuit is the wrong court to make\nsuch determinations. Statutes limit the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nreview to certain kinds of Veterans Court errors, namely,\nthose that concern \u201cthe validity of . . . any statute or regu\nlation . . . or any interpretation thereof.\u201d 38 U. S. C.\n\u00a77292. But the factors that inform a reviewing court\u2019s\n\u201charmless-error\u201d determination are various, potentially\ninvolving, among other case-specific factors, an estimation\nof the likelihood that the result would have been different,\nan awareness of what body (jury, lower court, administra\ntive agency) has the authority to reach that result, a con\nsideration of the error\u2019s likely effects on the perceived\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed\nings, and a hesitancy to generalize too broadly about\nparticular kinds of errors when the specific factual cir\ncumstances in which the error arises may well make all\nthe difference. See Neder, 527 U. S., at 18\u201319; Kotteakos,\nsupra, at 761\u2013763; Traynor 33\u201337.\n   It is the Veterans Court, not the Federal Circuit, that\nsees sufficient case-specific raw material in veterans\u2019 cases\nto enable it to make empirically based, nonbinding gener\nalizations about \u201cnatural effects.\u201d And the Veterans\nCourt, which has exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, is\nlikely better able than is the Federal Circuit to exercise an\ninformed judgment as to how often veterans are harmed\nby which kinds of notice errors. Cf. United States v. Hag\ngar Apparel Co., 526 U. S. 380, 394 (1999) (Article I court\u2019s\nspecial \u201cexpertise . . . guides it in making complex deter\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nminations in a specialized area of the law\u201d).\n   Second, we recognize that Congress has expressed spe\ncial solicitude for the veterans\u2019 cause. See post, at 2\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting). A veteran, after all, has per\nformed an especially important service for the Nation,\noften at the risk of his or her own life. And Congress has\nmade clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency. Rather,\nthe VA has a statutory duty to help the veteran develop\nhis or her benefits claim. See Veterans Claims Assistance\nAct of 2000, 38 U. S. C. \u00a75103A. Moreover, the adjudica\ntory process is not truly adversarial, and the veteran is\noften unrepresented during the claims proceedings. See\nWalters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473\nU. S. 305, 311 (1985). These facts might lead a reviewing\ncourt to consider harmful in a veteran\u2019s case error that it\nmight consider harmless in other circumstances. But that\nis not the question before us. And we need not here decide\nwhether, or to what extent, that may be so.\n                              III\n  We have considered the two cases before us in light of\nthe principles discussed. In Sanders\u2019 case, the Veterans\nCourt found the notice error harmless. And after review\ning the record, we conclude that finding is lawful. The VA\ntold Sanders what further evidence would be needed to\nsubstantiate his claim. It failed to specify what portion of\nany additional evidence the Secretary would provide (we\nimagine none) and what portion Sanders would have to\nprovide (we imagine all).\n  How could the VA\u2019s failure to specify this (or any other)\ndivision of labor have mattered? Sanders has pursued his\nclaim for over six decades; he has had numerous medical\nexaminations; and he should be aware of the respect in\nwhich his benefits claim is deficient (namely, his inability\nto show that his disability is connected to his World War II\nservice). See supra, at 5. Sanders has not told the Veter\n16                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nans Court, the Federal Circuit, or this Court, what specific\nadditional evidence proper notice would have led him to\nobtain or seek. He has not explained to the Veterans\nCourt, to the Federal Circuit, or to us, how the notice error\nto which he points could have made any difference. The\nVeterans Court did not consider the harmlessness issue a\nborderline question. Nor do we. We consequently reverse\nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand the case so\nthat the court can reinstate the judgment of the Veterans\nCourt.\n   Simmons\u2019 case is more difficult. The Veterans Court\nfound that the VA had committed a Type One error, i.e., a\nfailure to tell Simmons what information or evidence she\nmust provide to substantiate her claim. The VA sent\nSimmons a letter that provided her only with general\ninformation about how to prove a claim while telling her\nnothing at all about how to proceed further in her own\ncase, a case in which the question was whether a conced\nedly service-connected left-ear hearing problem had dete\nriorated to the point where it was compensable. And the\nVA did so in the context of having arranged for a further\nright-ear medical examination, which (because of lack of\nnotice) Simmons failed to attend. The Veterans Court\ntook the \u201cnatural effect\u201d of a Type One error into account\nwhile also reviewing the record as a whole.\n   Some features of the record suggest the error was harm\nless, for example, the fact that Simmons has long sought\nbenefits and has a long history of medical examinations.\nBut other features\u2014e.g., the fact that her left-ear hearing\nloss was concededly service connected and has continu\nously deteriorated over time, and the fact that the VA had\nscheduled a further examination of her right ear that (had\nnotice been given) might have revealed further left-ear\nhearing loss\u2014suggest the opposite. Given the uncertain\nties, we believe it is appropriate to remand this case so\nthat the Veterans Court can decide whether re\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2). We reverse the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s judgment in Sanders\u2019 case, and we va\ncate its judgment in Simmons\u2019 case. We remand both\ncases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

The Court reverses because the Federal Cir\ncuit\u2019s approach is \u201ccomplex, rigid, and mandatory,\u201d ante,\nat 9, \u201cimposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden upon\nthe VA,\u201d ante, at 10\u201311, and contradicts the rule in other\ncivil and administrative cases by \u201crequir[ing] the VA, not\nthe claimant, to explain why the error is harmless,\u201d ante,\nat 11. I respectfully disagree.\n   Taking the last point first, the Court assumes that there\nis a standard allocation of the burden of proving harm\nlessness that Congress meant to adopt in directing the\nVeterans Court to \u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudi\n2                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncial error.\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2). But as both the major\nity and the Government concede, \u201c[t]here are no hard-and\nfast standards governing the allocation of the burden of\nproof in every situation,\u201d Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Den\nver, 413 U. S. 189, 209 (1973), and courts impose the\nburden of dealing with harmlessness differently in differ\nent circumstances. As the Court says, the burden is on\nthe Government in criminal cases, ante, at 13, and even in\ncivil and administrative appeals courts sometimes require\nthe party getting the benefit of the error to show its harm\nlessness, depending on the statutory setting or specific\nsort of mistake made, see, e.g., McLouth Steel Prods. Corp.\nv. Thomas, 838 F. 2d 1317, 1324 (CADC 1988) (declaring\nthat imposing the burden of proving harm \u201con the chal\nlenger is normally inappropriate where the agency has\ncompletely failed to comply with\u201d notice and comment\nprocedures).\n   Thus, the question is whether placing the burden of\npersuasion on the veteran is in order under the statutory\nscheme governing the VA. I believe it is not. The VA\ndiffers from virtually every other agency in being itself\nobliged to help the claimant develop his claim, see, e.g., 38\nU. S. C. \u00a75103A, and a number of other provisions and\npractices of the VA\u2019s administrative and judicial review\nprocess reflect a congressional policy to favor the veteran,\nsee, e.g., \u00a75107(b) (\u201c[T]he Secretary shall give the benefit\nof the doubt to the claimant\u201d whenever \u201cthere is an ap\nproximate balance of positive and negative evidence re\ngarding any issue material to the determination of a mat\nter\u201d); \u00a77252(a) (allowing the veteran, but not the\nSecretary, to appeal an adverse decision to the Veterans\nCourt). Given Congress\u2019s understandable decision to place\na thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s favor in the course of\nadministrative and judicial review of VA decisions, I\nwould not remove a comparable benefit in the Veteran\u2019s\nCourt based on the ambiguous directive of \u00a77261(b)(2).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nAnd even if there were a question in my mind, I would\ncome out the same way under our longstanding \u201crule that\ninterpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran\u2019s favor.\u201d\nBrown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n    The majority\u2019s other arguments are open to judgment,\nbut I do not see that placing the burden of showing harm\non the VA goes so far as to create a \u201ccomplex, rigid, and\nmandatory\u201d scheme, ante, at 9, or to impose \u201can unreason\nable evidentiary burden upon the VA,\u201d ante, at 10\u201311.\nUnder the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule, the VA simply \u201cmust\npersuade the reviewing court that the purpose of the\nnotice was not frustrated, e.g., by demonstrating: (1) that\nany defect was cured by actual knowledge on the part of\nthe claimant, (2) that a reasonable person could be ex\npected to understand from the notice what was needed, or\n(3) that a benefit could not have been awarded as a matter\nof law.\u201d Sanders, supra, at 889. This gives the VA several\nways to show that an error was harmless, and the VA has\nbeen able to shoulder the burden in a number of cases.\nSee, e.g., Holmes v. Peake, No. 06\u20130852, 2008 WL 974728,\n*2 (Vet. App., Apr. 3, 2008) (Table) (finding notice error\nharmless because the claimant had \u201cactual knowledge of\nwhat was required to substantiate\u201d his claim); Clark v.\nPeake, No. 05\u20132422, 2008 WL 852588, *4 (Vet. App., Mar.\n24, 2008) (Table) (same).\n    The Federal Circuit\u2019s rule thus strikes me as workable\nand in keeping with the statutory scheme governing vet\nerans\u2019 benefits. It has the added virtue of giving the VA a\nstrong incentive to comply with its notice obligations,\nobligations \u201cthat g[o] to the very essence of the nonadver\nsarial, pro-claimant nature of the VA adjudication system\n. . . by affording a claimant a meaningful opportunity to\nparticipate effectively in the processing of his or her\nclaim.\u201d Mayfield v.

Argued December 8, 2008\u2014Decided April 21, 2009*\nAs part of the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) statutory duty to\n  help a veteran develop a benefits claim, the Secretary of Veterans Af\n  fairs (Secretary) must notify an applicant of any information or evi\n  dence that is necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 U. S. C.\n  \u00a75103(a). VA regulations require the notice to specify (1) what fur\n  ther information is necessary, (2) what portions of that information\n  the VA will obtain, and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.\n  These requirements are referred to as Type One, Type Two, and Type\n  Three, respectively.\n     The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), which\n  hears initial appeals from VA claims decisions, has a statutory duty\n  to \u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error.\u201d \u00a77261(b)(2). It\n  has developed a system for dealing with notice errors, whereby a\n  claimant arguing that the VA failed to give proper notice must ex\n  plain precisely how the notice was defective. The reviewing judge\n  will then decide what \u201ctype\u201d of notice error the VA committed. Under\n  the Veterans Court\u2019s approach, a Type One error has the \u201cnatural ef\n  fect\u201d of harming the claimant, but Types Two and Three errors do\n  not. In the latter instances, the claimant must show harm, e.g., by\n  describing what evidence he would have provided (or asked the Sec\n  retary to provide) had the notice not been defective, and explaining\n  just how the lack of that notice and evidence affected the adjudica\n  tion\u2019s essential fairness.\n     The Federal Circuit, which reviews Veterans Court decisions, re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs v. Simmons,\nalso on certiorari to the same court (see this Court\u2019s Rule 12.4).\n2                        SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jected the Veterans Court\u2019s approach and set forth its own framework\n    for determining whether a notice error is harmless. When the VA\n    provides a claimant with a notice that is deficient in any respect, the\n    framework requires the Veterans Court to presume that the error is\n    prejudicial and requires reversal unless the VA can demonstrate (1)\n    that the defect was cured by the claimant\u2019s actual knowledge or (2)\n    that benefits could not have been awarded as a matter of law. The\n    Federal Circuit applied its framework in both of the present cases.\n       In respondent Sanders\u2019 case, the VA denied disability benefits on\n    the ground that Sanders\u2019 disability, blindness in his right eye, was\n    not related to his military service. Sanders argued to the Veterans\n    Court that the VA had made notice errors Type Two and Type Three\n    when it informed him what further information was necessary, but\n    failed to tell him which portions of that information the Secretary\n    would provide and which portions he would have to provide. The\n    Veterans Court held these notice errors harmless, but the Federal\n    Circuit reversed, ruling that the VA had not made the necessary\n    claimant-knowledge or benefits-ineligibilty showing required by the\n    Federal Circuit\u2019s framework.\n       The VA also denied benefits in respondent Simmons\u2019 case after\n    finding that her left-ear hearing loss, while service connected, was\n    not severe enough to warrant compensation. Simmons argued to the\n    Veterans Court, inter alia, that the VA had made a Type One notice\n    error by failing to notify her of the information necessary to show\n    worsening of her hearing. The court agreed, finding the error preju\n    dicial. Noting that a Type One notice error has the \u201cnatural effect\u201d of\n    producing prejudice, the Veterans Court added that its review of the\n    record convinced it that Simmons did not have actual knowledge of\n    what evidence was necessary to substantiate her claim and, had the\n    VA told her more specifically what additional information was\n    needed, she might have obtained that evidence. The Federal Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Circuit\u2019s harmless-error framework conflicts with\n \u00a77261(b)(2)\u2019s requirement that the Veterans Court take \u201cdue account\n of the rule of prejudicial error.\u201d Pp. 8\u201315.\n       (a) That \u00a77261(b)(2) requires the same sort of \u201charmless-error\u201d\n rule as is ordinarily applied in civil cases is shown by the statutory\n words \u201ctake due account\u201d and \u201cprejudicial error.\u201d Congress used the\n same words in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.

See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760. Second, the\nframework imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden on the VA,\nrequiring the Secretary to demonstrate, e.g., a claimant\u2019s state of\nmind about what he knew or the nonexistence of evidence that might\nsignificantly help the claimant. Third, the framework requires the\nVA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless. The bur\nden of showing harmfulness is normally on the party attacking an\nagency\u2019s determination. See, e.g., Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109,\n116. This Court has placed the burden on the Government only when\nthe underlying matter was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos, supra, at\n760. The good reasons for this rule do not apply in the ordinary civil\ncase. Pp. 9\u201313.\n      (c) The foregoing analysis is subject to two important qualifica\ntions. First, the Court need not, and does not, decide the lawfulness\nof the Veterans Court\u2019s reliance on the \u201cnatural effects\u201d of certain\nkinds of notice errors. Second, although Congress\u2019 special solicitude\nfor veterans might lead a reviewing court to consider harmful in a\nveteran\u2019s case error that it might consider harmless in other cases,\nthat is not at issue, and need not be decided here. Pp. 13\u201315.\n   2. In Sanders\u2019 case, a review of the record demonstrates that the\nVeterans Court lawfully found the notice errors harmless. The VA\u2019s\nTypes Two and Three notice errors did not matter, given that Sand\ners has pursued his claim for many years and should be aware of why\nhe has been unable to show that his disability is service connected.\nSanders has not told the reviewing courts what additional evidence\nproper notice would have led him to obtain or seek and has not ex\nplained how the notice errors could have made any difference.\n   In Simmons\u2019 case, some features of the record suggest that the VA\u2019s\nType One error was harmless, e.g., that she has long sought benefits\nand has a long history of medical examinations. But other features,\ne.g., that her left-ear hearing loss was concededly service connected\nand has continuously deteriorated over time, suggest the opposite.\nGiven the uncertainties, the Veterans Court should decide whether\nreconsideration is necessary.

S. C. \u00a75103(a). In both cases the VA argued that\nthe error was harmless. And in both cases the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, after setting forth a\nframework for determining whether a notice error is\nharmless, rejected the VA\u2019s argument.\n  In our view, the Federal Circuit\u2019s \u201charmless-error\u201d\nframework is too complex and rigid, its presumptions\nimpose unreasonable evidentiary burdens upon the VA,\nand it is too likely too often to require the Court of Appeals\nfor Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) to treat as harmful\nerrors that in fact are harmless.

SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1944, causing later blindness in his right eye. His war\ntime medical records, however, did not indicate any eye\nproblems. Indeed, his 1945 discharge examination showed\nnear-perfect vision. But a 1948 eye examination revealed\nan inflammation of the right-eye retina and surrounding\ntissues\u2014a condition that eventually left him nearly blind\nin that eye. Soon after the examination Sanders filed a\nclaim for disability benefits. But in 1949 the VA denied\nbenefits on the ground that Sanders had failed to show a\nconnection between his eye condition and his earlier mili\ntary service.\n   Forty-two years later, Sanders asked the VA to reopen\nhis benefits claim. He argued that the 1944 bazooka\nexplosion had hurt his eye, and added that that he had\nbegun to experience symptoms\u2014blurred vision, swelling,\nand loss of sight\u2014in 1946. He included a report from a\nVA doctor, Dr. Joseph Ruda, who said that \u201c[i]t is not\ninconceivable that\u201d the condition \u201ccould have occurred\nsecondary to trauma, as stated by\u201d Sanders. A private\nophthalmologist, Dr. Gregory Strainer, confirming that\nSanders\u2019 right retina was scarred, added that this \u201c[t]ype\nof . . . injury . . . can certainly be concussive in character.\u201d\nApp. C to Pet. for Cert. 26a\u201327a.\n   In 1992, the VA reopened Sanders\u2019 claim.

S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncondition \u201cis most likely infectious in nature, although the\netiology at this point is impossible to determine.\u201d \u201cBased\non the documented records,\u201d she concluded, \u201cthe patient\ndid not lose vision while on active duty.\u201d The VA regional\noffice denied Sanders\u2019 claim. Ibid.\n   Sanders sought Board review, and in the meantime he\nobtained the opinion of another VA doctor, Dr. Duane Nii,\nwho said that the \u201cetiology of the patient\u2019s\u201d eye condition\n\u201cis . . . difficult to ascertain.\u201d He thought that \u201cit is possi\nble that\u201d the condition \u201ccould be related to\u201d a bazooka\nexplosion, though the \u201cpossibility of\u201d an infection \u201cas the\netiology . . . could also be entertained.\u201d Id., at 30a. The\nBoard concluded that Sanders had failed to show that the\neye injury was service connected. The Board said that it\nhad relied most heavily upon Anderson\u2019s report because,\nunlike other reports, it took account of Sanders\u2019 military\nmedical records documenting his eyesight at the time of\nhis enlistment and discharge. And the Board conse\nquently affirmed the regional office\u2019s denial of Sanders\u2019\nclaim.\n   Sanders then appealed to the Veterans Court. There he\nargued, among other things, that the VA had made a\nnotice error. Sanders conceded that the VA had sent him\na letter telling him (1) what further information was\nnecessary to substantiate his claim. But, he said, the VA\nletter did not tell him (2) which portions of the information\nthe Secretary would provide or (3) which portions he\nwould have to provide. That is to say, he complained\nabout notice errors Type Two and Type Three.\n   The Veterans Court held that these notice errors were\nharmless. It said that Sanders had not explained how he\nwould have acted differently, say, by identifying what\ndifferent evidence he would have produced or asked the\nSecretary to obtain for him, had he received proper notice.\nFinding no other error, the Veterans Court affirmed the\nBoard\u2019s decision.\n6                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             D\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed\nthe Veterans Court\u2019s decision and held that the Veterans\nCourt was wrong to find the notice error harmless. The\nFederal Circuit wrote that when the VA provides a claim\nant with a notice letter that is deficient in any respect (to\nthe point where a \u201creasonable person\u201d would not have read\nit as providing the necessary information), the Veterans\nCourt \u201cshould . . . presum[e]\u201d that the notice error is\n\u201cprejudicial, requiring reversal unless the VA can show\nthat the error did not affect the essential fairness of the\nadjudication.\u201d Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F. 3d 881, 889\n(2007). To make this latter showing, the court added, the\nVA must \u201cdemonstrate\u201d (1) that the \u201cdefect was cured by\nactual knowledge on the\u201d claimant\u2019s \u201cpart,\u201d or (2) \u201cthat a\nbenefit could not have been awarded as a matter of law.\u201d\nIbid. Because the VA had not made such a showing, the\nFederal Circuit reversed the Veterans Court\u2019s decision.\n                             E\n  In the second case before us, the claimant, Patricia\nSimmons, served on active military duty from December\n1978 to April 1980. While on duty she worked in a noisy\nenvironment close to aircraft; after three months she\nbegan to lose hearing in her left ear; and by the time she\nwas discharged, her left-ear hearing had become worse.\nSoon after her discharge, Simmons applied for disability\nbenefits. The VA regional office found her hearing loss\nwas service connected; but it also found the loss insuffi\nciently severe to warrant compensation. In November\n1980, it denied her claim.\n  In 1998, Simmons asked the VA to reopen her claim.\nShe provided medical examination records showing fur\nther loss of hearing in her left ear along with (what she\nconsidered related) loss of hearing in her right ear. The\nVA arranged for hearing examinations by VA doctors in\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1999, 2001, and 2002. The doctors measured her left-ear\nhearing loss, ranking it as moderate to severe; they also\nmeasured her right-ear hearing loss, ranking it as mild to\nmoderate. After comparing the results of the examina\ntions with a VA hearing-loss compensation schedule, the\nregional office concluded that Simmons\u2019 left-ear hearing\nloss, while service connected, was not severe enough to\nwarrant compensation. At the same time, the regional\noffice concluded that her right-ear hearing loss was nei\nther service connected nor sufficiently severe. Simmons\nappealed the decision to the Board, which affirmed the\nregional office\u2019s determination.\n   In 2003, Simmons appealed to the Veterans Court.\nAmong other things, she said that she had not received a\nnotice about (and she consequently failed to attend) a\nfurther right-ear medical examination that the VA later\ntold her it had arranged. She added that, in respect to her\nclaim for benefits for loss of hearing in her left ear, the VA\nhad made a Type One notice error (i.e., it had failed to tell\nher what further information was needed to substantiate\nher claim). Simmons conceded that she had received a\nletter from the VA. But the letter told her only what, in\ngeneral, a person had to do to show that a hearing injury\nwas service connected. It did not tell her anything about\nher specific problem, namely, what further information\nshe must provide to show a worsening of hearing in her\nleft ear, to the point where she could receive benefits.\n   The Veterans Court agreed with Simmons, and it found\nboth errors prejudicial. In respect to Simmons\u2019 left-ear\nhearing loss (the matter at issue here), it pointed out that\nit had earlier said (in Mayfield, 19 Vet. App., at 120\u2013124)\nthat a Type One notice error has the \u201cnatural effect of\nproducing prejudice.\u201d The court added that its \u201crevie[w]\n[of] the record in its entirety\u201d convinced it that Simmons\ndid not have \u201cactual knowledge of what evidence was\nnecessary to substantiate her claim\u201d and, had the VA told\n8                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSimmons more specifically about what additional medical\ninformation it needed, Simmons might have \u201cobtained\u201d a\nfurther \u201cprivate\u201d medical \u201cexamination substantiating her\nclaim.\u201d App. G to Pet. for Cert. 81a. The Veterans Court\nconsequently remanded the case to the Board.\n  The Government appealed the Veterans Court\u2019s deter\nmination to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nAnd that court affirmed the Veterans Court\u2019s decision on\nthe basis of its decision in Sanders. Simmons v. Nichol\nson, 487 F. 3d 892 (2007).\n                             F\n  We granted certiorari in both Sanders\u2019 and Simmons\u2019\ncases in order to determine the lawfulness of the Federal\nCircuit\u2019s \u201charmless-error\u201d holdings.\n                             II\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s holdings flow directly from its use\nof the \u201charmless-error\u201d framework that we have described.\nSupra, at 6. Thus we must decide whether that frame\nwork is consistent with a particular statutory require\nment, namely, the requirement that the Veterans Court\n\u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial error,\u201d\n38 U. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2). See supra, at 3. We conclude\nthat the framework is not consistent with the statutory\ndemand.\n                             A\n  We believe that the statute, in stating that the Veterans\nCourt must \u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial\nerror,\u201d requires the Veterans Court to apply the same kind\nof \u201charmless-error\u201d rule that courts ordinarily apply in\ncivil cases. The statutory words \u201ctake due account\u201d and\n\u201cprejudicial error\u201d make clear that is so. Congress used\nthe same words in the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA). 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706 (\u201c[A] court shall review the whole\nrecord . . . and due account shall be taken of the rule of\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudicial error\u201d). The Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the\nAdministrative Procedure Act explained that the APA\u2019s\nreference to \u201cprejudicial error\u201d is intended to \u201csu[m] up in\nsuccinct fashion the \u2018harmless error\u2019 rule applied by the\ncourts in the review of lower court decisions as well as of\nadministrative bodies.\u201d Dept. of Justice, Attorney Gen\neral\u2019s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 110\n(1947) (emphasis added). And we have previously de\nscribed \u00a7706 as an \u201c \u2018administrative law . . . harmless error\nrule.\u2019 \u201d National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nPDK Labs. Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement\nAdmin., 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004)). Legislative\nhistory confirms that Congress intended the Veterans\nCourt \u201cprejudicial error\u201d statute to \u201cincorporate a refer\nence\u201d to the APA\u2019s approach. S. Rep. No. 100\u2013418, p. 61\n(1988). We have no indication of any relevant distinction\nbetween the manner in which reviewing courts treat civil\nand administrative cases. Consequently, we assess the\nlawfulness of the Federal Circuit\u2019s approach in light of our\ngeneral case law governing application of the harmless\nerror standard.\n                            B\n  Three related features of the Federal Circuit\u2019s frame\nwork, taken together, convince us that it mandates an\napproach to harmless error that differs significantly from\nthe approach courts normally take in ordinary civil cases.\nFirst, the framework is complex, rigid, and mandatory. In\nevery case involving a notice error (of no matter which\nkind) the Veterans Court must find the error harmful\nunless the VA \u201cdemonstrate[s]\u201d (1) that the claimant\u2019s\n\u201cactual knowledge\u201d cured the defect or (2) that the claim\nant could not have received a benefit as a matter of law.\nSuppose the notice error, as in Sanders\u2019 case, consisted of\na failure to describe what additional information, if any,\n10                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe VA would provide. It might be obvious from the record\nin the particular case that the error made no difference.\nBut under the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule, the Veterans Court\nwould have to remand the case for new proceedings\nregardless.\n   We have previously warned against courts\u2019 determining\nwhether an error is harmless through the use of manda\ntory presumptions and rigid rules rather than case-specific\napplication of judgment, based upon examination of the\nrecord. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760\n(1946). The federal \u201charmless-error\u201d statute, now codified\nat 28 U. S. C. \u00a72111, tells courts to review cases for errors\nof law \u201cwithout regard to errors\u201d that do not affect the\nparties\u2019 \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d That language seeks to\nprevent appellate courts from becoming \u201c \u2018 impregnable\ncitadels of technicality, \u2019 \u201d Kotteakos, 328 U. S., at 759. And\nwe have read it as expressing a congressional preference\nfor determining \u201charmless error\u201d without the use of pre\nsumptions insofar as those presumptions may lead courts\nto find an error harmful, when, in fact, in the particular\ncase before the court, it is not. See id., at 760; O\u2019Neal v.\nMcAninch, 513 U. S. 432, 436\u2013437 (1995); see also R.\nTraynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 26 (1970) (herein\nafter Traynor) (reviewing court normally should \u201cdeter\nmine whether the error affected the judgment . . . without\nbenefit of such aids as presumptions . . . that expedite fact\nfinding at trial \u201d).\n   The Federal Circuit\u2019s presumptions exhibit the very\ncharacteristics that Congress sought to discourage. In the\ncases before us, they would prevent the reviewing court\nfrom directly asking the harmless-error question. They\nwould prevent that court from resting its conclusion on the\nfacts and circumstances of the particular case. And they\nwould require the reviewing court to find the notice error\nprejudicial even if that court, having read the entire re\ncord, conscientiously concludes the contrary.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, the Federal Circuit\u2019s framework imposes an\nunreasonable evidentiary burden upon the VA. How is the\nSecretary to demonstrate, in Sanders\u2019 case for example,\nthat Sanders knew that he, not the VA, would have to\nproduce more convincing evidence that the bazooka acci\ndent caused his eye injury? How could the Secretary\ndemonstrate that there is no evidence anywhere that\nwould entitle Sanders to benefits? To show a claimant\u2019s\nstate of mind about such a matter will often prove diffi\ncult, perhaps impossible. And even if the VA (as in Sand\ners\u2019 case) searches the military records and comes up\nemptyhanded, it may still prove difficult, or impossible, to\nprove the nonexistence of evidence lying somewhere about\nthat might significantly help the claimant.\n   We have previously pointed out that setting an eviden\ntiary \u201cbarrier so high that it could never be surmounted\nwould justify the very criticism that spawned the harm\nless-error doctrine,\u201d namely, reversing for error \u201c \u2018regard\nless of its effect on the judgment.\u2019 \u201d Neder v. United States,\n527 U. S. 1, 18 (1999) (quoting Traynor 50). The Federal\nCircuit\u2019s evidentiary rules increase the likelihood of rever\nsal in cases where, in fact, the error is harmless. And, as\nwe pointed out in Neder, that likelihood encourages abuse\nof the judicial process and diminishes the public\u2019s confi\ndence in the fair and effective operation of the judicial\nsystem. 527 U. S., at 18.\n   Third, the Federal Circuit\u2019s framework requires the VA,\nnot the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless.\nThis Court has said that the party that \u201cseeks to have a\njudgment set aside because of an erroneous ruling carries\nthe burden of showing that prejudice resulted.\u201d Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 116 (1943); see also Tipton v.\nSocony Mobil Oil Co., 375 U. S. 34, 36 (1963) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Borden Co., 347 U. S. 514, 516\u2013517\n(1954); cf. McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Green\nwood, 464 U. S. 548, 553 (1984); Market Street R. Co. v.\n12                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRailroad Comm\u2019n of Cal., 324 U. S. 548, 562 (1945) (find\ning error harmless \u201cin the absence of any showing of . . .\nprejudice\u201d).\n  Lower court cases make clear that courts have corre\nlated review of ordinary administrative proceedings to\nappellate review of civil cases in this respect. Conse\nquently, the burden of showing that an error is harmful\nnormally falls upon the party attacking the agency\u2019s de\ntermination. See, e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Depart\nment of Transp., 202 F. 3d 788, 797 (CA5 2000) (declining\nto remand where appellant failed to show that error in\nadministrative proceeding was harmful); Air Canada v.\nDepartment of Transp., 148 F. 3d 1142, 1156\u20131157 (CADC\n1998) (same); Nelson v. Apfel, 131 F. 3d 1228, 1236 (CA7\n1997) (same); Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F. 2d 735,\n740 (CA10 1993) (same); Camden v. Department of Labor,\n831 F. 2d 449, 451 (CA3 1987) (same); Panhandle Co-op\nAssn. v. EPA, 771 F. 2d 1149, 1153 (CA8 1985) (same);\nFrankfort v. FERC, 678 F. 2d 699, 708 (CA7 1982) (same);\nNLRB v. Seine & Line Fishermen, 374 F. 2d 974, 981 (CA9\n1967) (same).\n  To say that the claimant has the \u201cburden\u201d of showing\nthat an error was harmful is not to impose a complex\nsystem of \u201cburden shifting\u201d rules or a particularly onerous\nrequirement. In ordinary civil appeals, for example, the\nappellant will point to rulings by the trial judge that the\nappellant claims are erroneous, say, a ruling excluding\nfavorable evidence. Often the circumstances of the case\nwill make clear to the appellate judge that the ruling, if\nerroneous, was harmful and nothing further need be said.\nBut, if not, then the party seeking reversal normally must\nexplain why the erroneous ruling caused harm. If, for\nexample, the party seeking an affirmance makes a strong\nargument that the evidence on the point was overwhelm\ning regardless, it normally makes sense to ask the party\nseeking reversal to provide an explanation, say, by mar\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nshaling the facts and evidence showing the contrary. The\nparty seeking to reverse the result of a civil proceeding\nwill likely be in a position at least as good as, and often\nbetter than, the opposing party to explain how he has been\nhurt by an error. Cf. United States v. Fior D\u2019Italia, Inc.,\n536 U. S. 238, 256, n. 4 (2002) (SOUTER, J., dissenting).\n  Respondents urge the creation of a special rule for this\ncontext, placing upon the agency the burden of proving\nthat a notice error did not cause harm. But we have\nplaced such a burden on the appellee only when the mat\nter underlying review was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos,\n328 U. S., at 760. In criminal cases the Government seeks\nto deprive an individual of his liberty, thereby providing a\ngood reason to require the Government to explain why an\nerror should not upset the trial court\u2019s determination.\nAnd the fact that the Government must prove its case\nbeyond a reasonable doubt justifies a rule that makes it\nmore difficult for the reviewing court to find that an error\ndid not affect the outcome of a case. See United States v.\nOlano, 507 U. S. 725, 741 (1993) (stating that the Gov\nernment bears the \u201cburden of showing the absence of\nprejudice\u201d). But in the ordinary civil case that is not so.\nSee Palmer, supra, at 116.\n                              C\n  Our discussion above is subject to two important qualifi\ncations. First, we need not, and we do not, decide the\nlawfulness of the use by the Veterans Court of what it\ncalled the \u201cnatural effects\u201d of certain kinds of notice er\nrors. We have previously made clear that courts may\nsometimes make empirically based generalizations about\nwhat kinds of errors are likely, as a factual matter, to\nprove harmful. See Kotteakos, supra, at 760\u2013761 (review\ning courts may learn over time that the \u201c \u2018natural effect\u2019 \u201d\nof certain errors is \u201c \u2018to prejudice a litigant\u2019s substantial\nrights\u2019 \u201d (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 913, 65th Cong., 3d Sess.,\n14                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\np. 1 (1919))). And by drawing upon \u201cexperience\u201d that\nreveals some such \u201c \u2018natural effect,\u2019 \u201d a court might prop\nerly influence, though not control, future determinations.\nSee Kotteakos, supra, at 760\u2013761. We consider here,\nhowever, only the Federal Circuit\u2019s harmless-error frame\nwork. That framework, as we have said, is mandatory.\nAnd its presumptions are not based upon an effort to\ndetermine \u201cnatural effects.\u201d\n   Indeed, the Federal Circuit is the wrong court to make\nsuch determinations. Statutes limit the Federal Circuit\u2019s\nreview to certain kinds of Veterans Court errors, namely,\nthose that concern \u201cthe validity of . . . any statute or regu\nlation . . . or any interpretation thereof.\u201d 38 U. S. C.\n\u00a77292. But the factors that inform a reviewing court\u2019s\n\u201charmless-error\u201d determination are various, potentially\ninvolving, among other case-specific factors, an estimation\nof the likelihood that the result would have been different,\nan awareness of what body (jury, lower court, administra\ntive agency) has the authority to reach that result, a con\nsideration of the error\u2019s likely effects on the perceived\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed\nings, and a hesitancy to generalize too broadly about\nparticular kinds of errors when the specific factual cir\ncumstances in which the error arises may well make all\nthe difference. See Neder, 527 U. S., at 18\u201319; Kotteakos,\nsupra, at 761\u2013763; Traynor 33\u201337.\n   It is the Veterans Court, not the Federal Circuit, that\nsees sufficient case-specific raw material in veterans\u2019 cases\nto enable it to make empirically based, nonbinding gener\nalizations about \u201cnatural effects.\u201d And the Veterans\nCourt, which has exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, is\nlikely better able than is the Federal Circuit to exercise an\ninformed judgment as to how often veterans are harmed\nby which kinds of notice errors. Cf. United States v. Hag\ngar Apparel Co., 526 U. S. 380, 394 (1999) (Article I court\u2019s\nspecial \u201cexpertise . . . guides it in making complex deter\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nminations in a specialized area of the law\u201d).\n   Second, we recognize that Congress has expressed spe\ncial solicitude for the veterans\u2019 cause. See post, at 2\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting). A veteran, after all, has per\nformed an especially important service for the Nation,\noften at the risk of his or her own life. And Congress has\nmade clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency. Rather,\nthe VA has a statutory duty to help the veteran develop\nhis or her benefits claim. See Veterans Claims Assistance\nAct of 2000, 38 U. S. C. \u00a75103A. Moreover, the adjudica\ntory process is not truly adversarial, and the veteran is\noften unrepresented during the claims proceedings. See\nWalters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473\nU. S. 305, 311 (1985). These facts might lead a reviewing\ncourt to consider harmful in a veteran\u2019s case error that it\nmight consider harmless in other circumstances. But that\nis not the question before us. And we need not here decide\nwhether, or to what extent, that may be so.\n                              III\n  We have considered the two cases before us in light of\nthe principles discussed. In Sanders\u2019 case, the Veterans\nCourt found the notice error harmless. And after review\ning the record, we conclude that finding is lawful. The VA\ntold Sanders what further evidence would be needed to\nsubstantiate his claim. It failed to specify what portion of\nany additional evidence the Secretary would provide (we\nimagine none) and what portion Sanders would have to\nprovide (we imagine all).\n  How could the VA\u2019s failure to specify this (or any other)\ndivision of labor have mattered? Sanders has pursued his\nclaim for over six decades; he has had numerous medical\nexaminations; and he should be aware of the respect in\nwhich his benefits claim is deficient (namely, his inability\nto show that his disability is connected to his World War II\nservice). See supra, at 5. Sanders has not told the Veter\n16                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nans Court, the Federal Circuit, or this Court, what specific\nadditional evidence proper notice would have led him to\nobtain or seek. He has not explained to the Veterans\nCourt, to the Federal Circuit, or to us, how the notice error\nto which he points could have made any difference. The\nVeterans Court did not consider the harmlessness issue a\nborderline question. Nor do we. We consequently reverse\nthe Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment and remand the case so\nthat the court can reinstate the judgment of the Veterans\nCourt.\n   Simmons\u2019 case is more difficult. The Veterans Court\nfound that the VA had committed a Type One error, i.e., a\nfailure to tell Simmons what information or evidence she\nmust provide to substantiate her claim. The VA sent\nSimmons a letter that provided her only with general\ninformation about how to prove a claim while telling her\nnothing at all about how to proceed further in her own\ncase, a case in which the question was whether a conced\nedly service-connected left-ear hearing problem had dete\nriorated to the point where it was compensable. And the\nVA did so in the context of having arranged for a further\nright-ear medical examination, which (because of lack of\nnotice) Simmons failed to attend. The Veterans Court\ntook the \u201cnatural effect\u201d of a Type One error into account\nwhile also reviewing the record as a whole.\n   Some features of the record suggest the error was harm\nless, for example, the fact that Simmons has long sought\nbenefits and has a long history of medical examinations.\nBut other features\u2014e.g., the fact that her left-ear hearing\nloss was concededly service connected and has continu\nously deteriorated over time, and the fact that the VA had\nscheduled a further examination of her right ear that (had\nnotice been given) might have revealed further left-ear\nhearing loss\u2014suggest the opposite. Given the uncertain\nties, we believe it is appropriate to remand this case so\nthat the Veterans Court can decide whether re\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n\n  AFFAIRS, PETITIONER v. WOODROW F. SANDERS\n\n   ERIC K. SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n\n  AFFAIRS, PETITIONER v. PATRICIA D. SIMMONS \n\nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                        [April 21, 2009]\n\n   JUSTICE SOUTER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS and\nJUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.\n   Federal law requires the Court of Appeals for Veterans\nClaims to \u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudicial\nerror.\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2). Under this provision,\nwhen the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) fails to\nnotify a veteran of the information needed to support his\nbenefit claim, as required by 38 U. S. C. \u00a75103(a), must\nthe veteran prove the error harmful, or must the VA prove\nits error harmless? The Federal Circuit held that the VA\nshould bear the burden. Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F. 3d\n881 (2007). The Court reverses because the Federal Cir\ncuit\u2019s approach is \u201ccomplex, rigid, and mandatory,\u201d ante,\nat 9, \u201cimposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden upon\nthe VA,\u201d ante, at 10\u201311, and contradicts the rule in other\ncivil and administrative cases by \u201crequir[ing] the VA, not\nthe claimant, to explain why the error is harmless,\u201d ante,\nat 11. I respectfully disagree.\n   Taking the last point first, the Court assumes that there\nis a standard allocation of the burden of proving harm\nlessness that Congress meant to adopt in directing the\nVeterans Court to \u201ctake due account of the rule of prejudi\n2                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncial error.\u201d 38 U. S. C. \u00a77261(b)(2). But as both the major\nity and the Government concede, \u201c[t]here are no hard-and\nfast standards governing the allocation of the burden of\nproof in every situation,\u201d Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Den\nver, 413 U. S. 189, 209 (1973), and courts impose the\nburden of dealing with harmlessness differently in differ\nent circumstances. As the Court says, the burden is on\nthe Government in criminal cases, ante, at 13, and even in\ncivil and administrative appeals courts sometimes require\nthe party getting the benefit of the error to show its harm\nlessness, depending on the statutory setting or specific\nsort of mistake made, see, e.g., McLouth Steel Prods. Corp.\nv. Thomas, 838 F. 2d 1317, 1324 (CADC 1988) (declaring\nthat imposing the burden of proving harm \u201con the chal\nlenger is normally inappropriate where the agency has\ncompletely failed to comply with\u201d notice and comment\nprocedures).\n   Thus, the question is whether placing the burden of\npersuasion on the veteran is in order under the statutory\nscheme governing the VA. I believe it is not. The VA\ndiffers from virtually every other agency in being itself\nobliged to help the claimant develop his claim, see, e.g., 38\nU. S. C. \u00a75103A, and a number of other provisions and\npractices of the VA\u2019s administrative and judicial review\nprocess reflect a congressional policy to favor the veteran,\nsee, e.g., \u00a75107(b) (\u201c[T]he Secretary shall give the benefit\nof the doubt to the claimant\u201d whenever \u201cthere is an ap\nproximate balance of positive and negative evidence re\ngarding any issue material to the determination of a mat\nter\u201d); \u00a77252(a) (allowing the veteran, but not the\nSecretary, to appeal an adverse decision to the Veterans\nCourt). Given Congress\u2019s understandable decision to place\na thumb on the scale in the veteran\u2019s favor in the course of\nadministrative and judicial review of VA decisions, I\nwould not remove a comparable benefit in the Veteran\u2019s\nCourt based on the ambiguous directive of \u00a77261(b)(2).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nAnd even if there were a question in my mind, I would\ncome out the same way under our longstanding \u201crule that\ninterpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran\u2019s favor.\u201d\nBrown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n    The majority\u2019s other arguments are open to judgment,\nbut I do not see that placing the burden of showing harm\non the VA goes so far as to create a \u201ccomplex, rigid, and\nmandatory\u201d scheme, ante, at 9, or to impose \u201can unreason\nable evidentiary burden upon the VA,\u201d ante, at 10\u201311.\nUnder the Federal Circuit\u2019s rule, the VA simply \u201cmust\npersuade the reviewing court that the purpose of the\nnotice was not frustrated, e.g., by demonstrating: (1) that\nany defect was cured by actual knowledge on the part of\nthe claimant, (2) that a reasonable person could be ex\npected to understand from the notice what was needed, or\n(3) that a benefit could not have been awarded as a matter\nof law.\u201d Sanders, supra, at 889. This gives the VA several\nways to show that an error was harmless, and the VA has\nbeen able to shoulder the burden in a number of cases.\nSee, e.g., Holmes v. Peake, No. 06\u20130852, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">974728</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n*2 (Vet. App., Apr. 3, 2008) (Table) (finding notice error\nharmless because the claimant had \u201cactual knowledge of\nwhat was required to substantiate\u201d his claim); Clark v.\nPeake, No. 05\u20132422, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">852588</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *4 (Vet.

It has the added virtue of giving the VA a\nstrong incentive to comply with its notice obligations,\nobligations \u201cthat g[o] to the very essence of the nonadver\nsarial, pro-claimant nature of the VA adjudication system\n. . . by affording a claimant a meaningful opportunity to\nparticipate effectively in the processing of his or her\nclaim.\u201d Mayfield v. Nicholson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"817036\"><a href=\"/opinion/817036/mayfield-v-nicholson/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vet.
