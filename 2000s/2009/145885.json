Argued December 8, 2008—Decided April 21, 2009*\nAs part of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) statutory duty to\n  help a veteran develop a benefits claim, the Secretary of Veterans Af\n  fairs (Secretary) must notify an applicant of any information or evi\n  dence that is necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 U. S. C.\n  §5103(a). VA regulations require the notice to specify (1) what fur\n  ther information is necessary, (2) what portions of that information\n  the VA will obtain, and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.\n  These requirements are referred to as Type One, Type Two, and Type\n  Three, respectively.\n     The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), which\n  hears initial appeals from VA claims decisions, has a statutory duty\n  to “take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.” §7261(b)(2). It\n  has developed a system for dealing with notice errors, whereby a\n  claimant arguing that the VA failed to give proper notice must ex\n  plain precisely how the notice was defective. The reviewing judge\n  will then decide what “type” of notice error the VA committed. Under\n  the Veterans Court’s approach, a Type One error has the “natural ef\n  fect” of harming the claimant, but Types Two and Three errors do\n  not. In the latter instances, the claimant must show harm, e.g., by\n  describing what evidence he would have provided (or asked the Sec\n  retary to provide) had the notice not been defective, and explaining\n  just how the lack of that notice and evidence affected the adjudica\n  tion’s essential fairness.\n     The Federal Circuit, which reviews Veterans Court decisions, re\n——————\n  * Together with Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs v. Simmons,\nalso on certiorari to the same court (see this Court’s Rule 12.4).\n2                        SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jected the Veterans Court’s approach and set forth its own framework\n    for determining whether a notice error is harmless. When the VA\n    provides a claimant with a notice that is deficient in any respect, the\n    framework requires the Veterans Court to presume that the error is\n    prejudicial and requires reversal unless the VA can demonstrate (1)\n    that the defect was cured by the claimant’s actual knowledge or (2)\n    that benefits could not have been awarded as a matter of law. The\n    Federal Circuit applied its framework in both of the present cases.\n       In respondent Sanders’ case, the VA denied disability benefits on\n    the ground that Sanders’ disability, blindness in his right eye, was\n    not related to his military service. Sanders argued to the Veterans\n    Court that the VA had made notice errors Type Two and Type Three\n    when it informed him what further information was necessary, but\n    failed to tell him which portions of that information the Secretary\n    would provide and which portions he would have to provide. The\n    Veterans Court held these notice errors harmless, but the Federal\n    Circuit reversed, ruling that the VA had not made the necessary\n    claimant-knowledge or benefits-ineligibilty showing required by the\n    Federal Circuit’s framework.\n       The VA also denied benefits in respondent Simmons’ case after\n    finding that her left-ear hearing loss, while service connected, was\n    not severe enough to warrant compensation. Simmons argued to the\n    Veterans Court, inter alia, that the VA had made a Type One notice\n    error by failing to notify her of the information necessary to show\n    worsening of her hearing. The court agreed, finding the error preju\n    dicial. Noting that a Type One notice error has the “natural effect” of\n    producing prejudice, the Veterans Court added that its review of the\n    record convinced it that Simmons did not have actual knowledge of\n    what evidence was necessary to substantiate her claim and, had the\n    VA told her more specifically what additional information was\n    needed, she might have obtained that evidence. The Federal Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Circuit’s harmless-error framework conflicts with\n §7261(b)(2)’s requirement that the Veterans Court take “due account\n of the rule of prejudicial error.” Pp. 8–15.\n       (a) That §7261(b)(2) requires the same sort of “harmless-error”\n rule as is ordinarily applied in civil cases is shown by the statutory\n words “take due account” and “prejudicial error.” Congress used the\n same words in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.\n §706, which is an “ ‘administrative law . . . harmless error rule,’ ” Na\n tional Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644,\n ___. Legislative history confirms that Congress intended §7261(b)(2)\n to incorporate the APA’s approach. Pp. 8–9.\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (b) Three related features, taken together, demonstrate that the\nFederal Circuit’s framework mandates an approach to harmless error\nthat differs significantly from the one normally taken in civil cases.\nFirst, the framework is too complex and rigid: In every case involving\nany type of notice error, the Veterans Court must find the error\nharmful unless the VA demonstrates the claimant’s actual knowledge\ncuring the defect or his ineligibility for benefits as a matter of law.\nAn error’s harmlessness should not be determined through the use of\nmandatory presumptions and rigid rules, but through the case\nspecific application of judgment, based upon examination of the re\ncord. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760. Second, the\nframework imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden on the VA,\nrequiring the Secretary to demonstrate, e.g., a claimant’s state of\nmind about what he knew or the nonexistence of evidence that might\nsignificantly help the claimant. Third, the framework requires the\nVA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless. The bur\nden of showing harmfulness is normally on the party attacking an\nagency’s determination. See, e.g., Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109,\n116. This Court has placed the burden on the Government only when\nthe underlying matter was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos, supra, at\n760. The good reasons for this rule do not apply in the ordinary civil\ncase. Pp. 9–13.\n      (c) The foregoing analysis is subject to two important qualifica\ntions. First, the Court need not, and does not, decide the lawfulness\nof the Veterans Court’s reliance on the “natural effects” of certain\nkinds of notice errors. Second, although Congress’ special solicitude\nfor veterans might lead a reviewing court to consider harmful in a\nveteran’s case error that it might consider harmless in other cases,\nthat is not at issue, and need not be decided here. Pp. 13–15.\n   2. In Sanders’ case, a review of the record demonstrates that the\nVeterans Court lawfully found the notice errors harmless. The VA’s\nTypes Two and Three notice errors did not matter, given that Sand\ners has pursued his claim for many years and should be aware of why\nhe has been unable to show that his disability is service connected.\nSanders has not told the reviewing courts what additional evidence\nproper notice would have led him to obtain or seek and has not ex\nplained how the notice errors could have made any difference.\n   In Simmons’ case, some features of the record suggest that the VA’s\nType One error was harmless, e.g., that she has long sought benefits\nand has a long history of medical examinations. But other features,\ne.g., that her left-ear hearing loss was concededly service connected\nand has continuously deteriorated over time, suggest the opposite.\nGiven the uncertainties, the Veterans Court should decide whether\nreconsideration is necessary.

SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n\n  AFFAIRS, PETITIONER v. WOODROW F. SANDERS\n\n   ERIC K. SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n\n  AFFAIRS, PETITIONER v. PATRICIA D. SIMMONS \n\nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                                 [April 21, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In these two civil cases, the Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA) denied veterans’ claims for disability benefits.\nIn both cases the VA erroneously failed to provide the\nveteran with a certain kind of statutorily required notice.\nSee 38 U. S. C. §5103(a). In both cases the VA argued that\nthe error was harmless. And in both cases the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, after setting forth a\nframework for determining whether a notice error is\nharmless, rejected the VA’s argument.\n  In our view, the Federal Circuit’s “harmless-error”\nframework is too complex and rigid, its presumptions\nimpose unreasonable evidentiary burdens upon the VA,\nand it is too likely too often to require the Court of Appeals\nfor Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) to treat as harmful\nerrors that in fact are harmless. We conclude that the\nframework conflicts with established law. See §7261(b)(2)\n(Veterans Court must “take due account of the rule of\nprejudicial error”).\n2                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   The law entitles veterans who have served on active\nduty in the United States military to receive benefits for\ndisabilities caused or aggravated by their military service.\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the\nVA to help a veteran develop his or her benefits claim.\n§5103A. In doing so, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n(Secretary), upon “receipt of” an “application” for benefits,\nmust “notify the claimant . . . of any information, and any\nmedical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the\nSecretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.” As\n“part of” the required “notice,” the Secretary must also\n“indicate which portion of” the required “information and\nevidence . . . is to be provided by the claimant and which\nportion . . . the Secretary . . . will attempt to obtain.”\n§5103(a).\n   Repeating these statutory requirements in its regula\ntions, the VA has said it will provide a claimant with a\nletter that tells the claimant (1) what further information\nis necessary to substantiate his or her claim; (2) what\nportions of that information the VA will obtain for the\nclaimant; and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.\n38 CFR §3.159(b) (2008). At the time of the decisions\nbelow, the regulations also required the VA to tell the\nclaimant (4) that he may submit any other relevant infor\nmation that he has available. §3.159(b)(1). (The VA refers\nto these notice requirements as Type One, Type Two, Type\nThree, and Type Four, respectively.)\n                            B\n  The VA’s regional offices decide most claims. A claim\nant may appeal an adverse regional office decision to the\nVA’s Board of Veterans’ Appeals, an administrative board\nwith the power to consider certain types of new evidence.\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n38 U. S. C. §§7107(b), 7109(a); 38 CFR §20.1304(c). The\nclaimant may seek review of an adverse Board decision in\nthe Veterans Court, an Article I court. And the claimant\n(or the Government) may appeal an adverse decision of the\nVeterans Court to the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit—but only in respect to certain legal matters,\nnamely, “the validity . . . of any statute or regulation . . . or\nany interpretation thereof . . . that was relied on” by the\nVeterans Court in making its decision. 38 U. S. C. §7292.\n  A specific statute requires the Veterans Court to “take\ndue account of the rule of prejudicial error.” §7261(b)(2).\nIn applying this statutory provision, the Veterans Court\nhas developed its own special framework for notice errors.\nUnder this framework, a claimant who argues that the VA\nfailed to give proper notice must explain precisely how the\nnotice was defective. Then the reviewing judge will decide\nwhat “type” of notice error the VA committed. The Veter\nans Court has gone on to say that a Type One error (i.e., a\nfailure to explain what further information is needed) has\nthe “natural effect” of harming the claimant; but errors of\nTypes Two, Three, or Four (i.e., a failure to explain just\nwho, claimant or agency, must provide the needed mate\nrial or to tell the veteran that he may submit any other\nevidence available) do not have the “natural effect” of\nharming the claimant. In these latter instances, the\nclaimant must show how the error caused harm, for ex\nample, by stating in particular just “what evidence” he\nwould have provided (or asked the Secretary to provide)\nhad the notice not been defective, and explaining just “how\nthe lack of that notice and evidence affected the essential\nfairness of the adjudication.” Mayfield v. Nicholson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"817036\"><a href=\"/opinion/817036/mayfield-v-nicholson/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Vet. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121 (2005).\n                           C\n  In the first case, Woodrow Sanders, a veteran of World\nWar II, claimed that a bazooka exploded near his face in\n4                   SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1944, causing later blindness in his right eye. His war\ntime medical records, however, did not indicate any eye\nproblems. Indeed, his 1945 discharge examination showed\nnear-perfect vision. But a 1948 eye examination revealed\nan inflammation of the right-eye retina and surrounding\ntissues—a condition that eventually left him nearly blind\nin that eye. Soon after the examination Sanders filed a\nclaim for disability benefits. But in 1949 the VA denied\nbenefits on the ground that Sanders had failed to show a\nconnection between his eye condition and his earlier mili\ntary service.\n   Forty-two years later, Sanders asked the VA to reopen\nhis benefits claim. He argued that the 1944 bazooka\nexplosion had hurt his eye, and added that that he had\nbegun to experience symptoms—blurred vision, swelling,\nand loss of sight—in 1946. He included a report from a\nVA doctor, Dr. Joseph Ruda, who said that “[i]t is not\ninconceivable that” the condition “could have occurred\nsecondary to trauma, as stated by” Sanders. A private\nophthalmologist, Dr. Gregory Strainer, confirming that\nSanders’ right retina was scarred, added that this “[t]ype\nof . . . injury . . . can certainly be concussive in character.”\nApp. C to Pet. for Cert. 26a–27a.\n   In 1992, the VA reopened Sanders’ claim. Id., at 29a.\nAfter obtaining Sanders’ military medical records, the VA\narranged for a further medical examination, this time by\nVA eye specialist Dr. Sheila Anderson. After examining\nSanders’ medical history (including records of the exami\nnations made at the time of Sanders’ enlistment and\ndischarge), Anderson agreed with the medical diagnosis\nbut concluded that Sanders’ condition was not service\nrelated. Since Sanders’ right-eye “visual acuity” was\n“20/20” upon enlistment and “20/25” upon discharge, and\nhe had “reported decreased vision only 6 months prior” to\nhis 1948 doctor’s “visit,” and since “there are no other\nsigns of ocular trauma,” Anderson thought that Sanders’\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncondition “is most likely infectious in nature, although the\netiology at this point is impossible to determine.” “Based\non the documented records,” she concluded, “the patient\ndid not lose vision while on active duty.” The VA regional\noffice denied Sanders’ claim. Ibid.\n   Sanders sought Board review, and in the meantime he\nobtained the opinion of another VA doctor, Dr. Duane Nii,\nwho said that the “etiology of the patient’s” eye condition\n“is . . . difficult to ascertain.” He thought that “it is possi\nble that” the condition “could be related to” a bazooka\nexplosion, though the “possibility of” an infection “as the\netiology . . . could also be entertained.” Id., at 30a. The\nBoard concluded that Sanders had failed to show that the\neye injury was service connected. The Board said that it\nhad relied most heavily upon Anderson’s report because,\nunlike other reports, it took account of Sanders’ military\nmedical records documenting his eyesight at the time of\nhis enlistment and discharge. And the Board conse\nquently affirmed the regional office’s denial of Sanders’\nclaim.\n   Sanders then appealed to the Veterans Court. There he\nargued, among other things, that the VA had made a\nnotice error. Sanders conceded that the VA had sent him\na letter telling him (1) what further information was\nnecessary to substantiate his claim. But, he said, the VA\nletter did not tell him (2) which portions of the information\nthe Secretary would provide or (3) which portions he\nwould have to provide. That is to say, he complained\nabout notice errors Type Two and Type Three.\n   The Veterans Court held that these notice errors were\nharmless. It said that Sanders had not explained how he\nwould have acted differently, say, by identifying what\ndifferent evidence he would have produced or asked the\nSecretary to obtain for him, had he received proper notice.\nFinding no other error, the Veterans Court affirmed the\nBoard’s decision.\n6                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             D\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed\nthe Veterans Court’s decision and held that the Veterans\nCourt was wrong to find the notice error harmless. The\nFederal Circuit wrote that when the VA provides a claim\nant with a notice letter that is deficient in any respect (to\nthe point where a “reasonable person” would not have read\nit as providing the necessary information), the Veterans\nCourt “should . . . presum[e]” that the notice error is\n“prejudicial, requiring reversal unless the VA can show\nthat the error did not affect the essential fairness of the\nadjudication.” Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F. 3d 881, 889\n(2007). To make this latter showing, the court added, the\nVA must “demonstrate” (1) that the “defect was cured by\nactual knowledge on the” claimant’s “part,” or (2) “that a\nbenefit could not have been awarded as a matter of law.”\nIbid. Because the VA had not made such a showing, the\nFederal Circuit reversed the Veterans Court’s decision.\n                             E\n  In the second case before us, the claimant, Patricia\nSimmons, served on active military duty from December\n1978 to April 1980. While on duty she worked in a noisy\nenvironment close to aircraft; after three months she\nbegan to lose hearing in her left ear; and by the time she\nwas discharged, her left-ear hearing had become worse.\nSoon after her discharge, Simmons applied for disability\nbenefits. The VA regional office found her hearing loss\nwas service connected; but it also found the loss insuffi\nciently severe to warrant compensation. In November\n1980, it denied her claim.\n  In 1998, Simmons asked the VA to reopen her claim.\nShe provided medical examination records showing fur\nther loss of hearing in her left ear along with (what she\nconsidered related) loss of hearing in her right ear. The\nVA arranged for hearing examinations by VA doctors in\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1999, 2001, and 2002. The doctors measured her left-ear\nhearing loss, ranking it as moderate to severe; they also\nmeasured her right-ear hearing loss, ranking it as mild to\nmoderate. After comparing the results of the examina\ntions with a VA hearing-loss compensation schedule, the\nregional office concluded that Simmons’ left-ear hearing\nloss, while service connected, was not severe enough to\nwarrant compensation. At the same time, the regional\noffice concluded that her right-ear hearing loss was nei\nther service connected nor sufficiently severe. Simmons\nappealed the decision to the Board, which affirmed the\nregional office’s determination.\n   In 2003, Simmons appealed to the Veterans Court.\nAmong other things, she said that she had not received a\nnotice about (and she consequently failed to attend) a\nfurther right-ear medical examination that the VA later\ntold her it had arranged. She added that, in respect to her\nclaim for benefits for loss of hearing in her left ear, the VA\nhad made a Type One notice error (i.e., it had failed to tell\nher what further information was needed to substantiate\nher claim). Simmons conceded that she had received a\nletter from the VA. But the letter told her only what, in\ngeneral, a person had to do to show that a hearing injury\nwas service connected. It did not tell her anything about\nher specific problem, namely, what further information\nshe must provide to show a worsening of hearing in her\nleft ear, to the point where she could receive benefits.\n   The Veterans Court agreed with Simmons, and it found\nboth errors prejudicial. In respect to Simmons’ left-ear\nhearing loss (the matter at issue here), it pointed out that\nit had earlier said (in Mayfield, 19 Vet. App., at 120–124)\nthat a Type One notice error has the “natural effect of\nproducing prejudice.” The court added that its “revie[w]\n[of] the record in its entirety” convinced it that Simmons\ndid not have “actual knowledge of what evidence was\nnecessary to substantiate her claim” and, had the VA told\n8                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSimmons more specifically about what additional medical\ninformation it needed, Simmons might have “obtained” a\nfurther “private” medical “examination substantiating her\nclaim.” App. G to Pet. for Cert. 81a. The Veterans Court\nconsequently remanded the case to the Board.\n  The Government appealed the Veterans Court’s deter\nmination to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nAnd that court affirmed the Veterans Court’s decision on\nthe basis of its decision in Sanders. Simmons v. Nichol\nson, 487 F. 3d 892 (2007).\n                             F\n  We granted certiorari in both Sanders’ and Simmons’\ncases in order to determine the lawfulness of the Federal\nCircuit’s “harmless-error” holdings.\n                             II\n   The Federal Circuit’s holdings flow directly from its use\nof the “harmless-error” framework that we have described.\nSupra, at 6. Thus we must decide whether that frame\nwork is consistent with a particular statutory require\nment, namely, the requirement that the Veterans Court\n“take due account of the rule of prejudicial error,”\n38 U. S. C. §7261(b)(2). See supra, at 3. We conclude\nthat the framework is not consistent with the statutory\ndemand.\n                             A\n  We believe that the statute, in stating that the Veterans\nCourt must “take due account of the rule of prejudicial\nerror,” requires the Veterans Court to apply the same kind\nof “harmless-error” rule that courts ordinarily apply in\ncivil cases. The statutory words “take due account” and\n“prejudicial error” make clear that is so. Congress used\nthe same words in the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA). 5 U. S. C. §706 (“[A] court shall review the whole\nrecord . . . and due account shall be taken of the rule of\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudicial error”). The Attorney General’s Manual on the\nAdministrative Procedure Act explained that the APA’s\nreference to “prejudicial error” is intended to “su[m] up in\nsuccinct fashion the ‘harmless error’ rule applied by the\ncourts in the review of lower court decisions as well as of\nadministrative bodies.” Dept. of Justice, Attorney Gen\neral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 110\n(1947) (emphasis added). And we have previously de\nscribed §706 as an “ ‘administrative law . . . harmless error\nrule.’ ” National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nPDK Labs. Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement\nAdmin., 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004)). Legislative\nhistory confirms that Congress intended the Veterans\nCourt “prejudicial error” statute to “incorporate a refer\nence” to the APA’s approach. S. Rep. No. 100–418, p. 61\n(1988). We have no indication of any relevant distinction\nbetween the manner in which reviewing courts treat civil\nand administrative cases. Consequently, we assess the\nlawfulness of the Federal Circuit’s approach in light of our\ngeneral case law governing application of the harmless\nerror standard.\n                            B\n  Three related features of the Federal Circuit’s frame\nwork, taken together, convince us that it mandates an\napproach to harmless error that differs significantly from\nthe approach courts normally take in ordinary civil cases.\nFirst, the framework is complex, rigid, and mandatory. In\nevery case involving a notice error (of no matter which\nkind) the Veterans Court must find the error harmful\nunless the VA “demonstrate[s]” (1) that the claimant’s\n“actual knowledge” cured the defect or (2) that the claim\nant could not have received a benefit as a matter of law.\nSuppose the notice error, as in Sanders’ case, consisted of\na failure to describe what additional information, if any,\n10                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe VA would provide. It might be obvious from the record\nin the particular case that the error made no difference.\nBut under the Federal Circuit’s rule, the Veterans Court\nwould have to remand the case for new proceedings\nregardless.\n   We have previously warned against courts’ determining\nwhether an error is harmless through the use of manda\ntory presumptions and rigid rules rather than case-specific\napplication of judgment, based upon examination of the\nrecord. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760\n(1946). The federal “harmless-error” statute, now codified\nat 28 U. S. C. §2111, tells courts to review cases for errors\nof law “without regard to errors” that do not affect the\nparties’ “substantial rights.” That language seeks to\nprevent appellate courts from becoming “ ‘ impregnable\ncitadels of technicality, ’ ” Kotteakos, 328 U. S., at 759. And\nwe have read it as expressing a congressional preference\nfor determining “harmless error” without the use of pre\nsumptions insofar as those presumptions may lead courts\nto find an error harmful, when, in fact, in the particular\ncase before the court, it is not. See id., at 760; O’Neal v.\nMcAninch, 513 U. S. 432, 436–437 (1995); see also R.\nTraynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 26 (1970) (herein\nafter Traynor) (reviewing court normally should “deter\nmine whether the error affected the judgment . . . without\nbenefit of such aids as presumptions . . . that expedite fact\nfinding at trial ”).\n   The Federal Circuit’s presumptions exhibit the very\ncharacteristics that Congress sought to discourage. In the\ncases before us, they would prevent the reviewing court\nfrom directly asking the harmless-error question. They\nwould prevent that court from resting its conclusion on the\nfacts and circumstances of the particular case. And they\nwould require the reviewing court to find the notice error\nprejudicial even if that court, having read the entire re\ncord, conscientiously concludes the contrary.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, the Federal Circuit’s framework imposes an\nunreasonable evidentiary burden upon the VA. How is the\nSecretary to demonstrate, in Sanders’ case for example,\nthat Sanders knew that he, not the VA, would have to\nproduce more convincing evidence that the bazooka acci\ndent caused his eye injury? How could the Secretary\ndemonstrate that there is no evidence anywhere that\nwould entitle Sanders to benefits? To show a claimant’s\nstate of mind about such a matter will often prove diffi\ncult, perhaps impossible. And even if the VA (as in Sand\ners’ case) searches the military records and comes up\nemptyhanded, it may still prove difficult, or impossible, to\nprove the nonexistence of evidence lying somewhere about\nthat might significantly help the claimant.\n   We have previously pointed out that setting an eviden\ntiary “barrier so high that it could never be surmounted\nwould justify the very criticism that spawned the harm\nless-error doctrine,” namely, reversing for error “ ‘regard\nless of its effect on the judgment.’ ” Neder v. United States,\n527 U. S. 1, 18 (1999) (quoting Traynor 50). The Federal\nCircuit’s evidentiary rules increase the likelihood of rever\nsal in cases where, in fact, the error is harmless. And, as\nwe pointed out in Neder, that likelihood encourages abuse\nof the judicial process and diminishes the public’s confi\ndence in the fair and effective operation of the judicial\nsystem. 527 U. S., at 18.\n   Third, the Federal Circuit’s framework requires the VA,\nnot the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless.\nThis Court has said that the party that “seeks to have a\njudgment set aside because of an erroneous ruling carries\nthe burden of showing that prejudice resulted.” Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 116 (1943); see also Tipton v.\nSocony Mobil Oil Co., 375 U. S. 34, 36 (1963) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Borden Co., 347 U. S. 514, 516–517\n(1954); cf. McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Green\nwood, 464 U. S. 548, 553 (1984); Market Street R. Co. v.\n12                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRailroad Comm’n of Cal., 324 U. S. 548, 562 (1945) (find\ning error harmless “in the absence of any showing of . . .\nprejudice”).\n  Lower court cases make clear that courts have corre\nlated review of ordinary administrative proceedings to\nappellate review of civil cases in this respect. Conse\nquently, the burden of showing that an error is harmful\nnormally falls upon the party attacking the agency’s de\ntermination. See, e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Depart\nment of Transp., 202 F. 3d 788, 797 (CA5 2000) (declining\nto remand where appellant failed to show that error in\nadministrative proceeding was harmful); Air Canada v.\nDepartment of Transp., 148 F. 3d 1142, 1156–1157 (CADC\n1998) (same); Nelson v. Apfel, 131 F. 3d 1228, 1236 (CA7\n1997) (same); Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F. 2d 735,\n740 (CA10 1993) (same); Camden v. Department of Labor,\n831 F. 2d 449, 451 (CA3 1987) (same); Panhandle Co-op\nAssn. v. EPA, 771 F. 2d 1149, 1153 (CA8 1985) (same);\nFrankfort v. FERC, 678 F. 2d 699, 708 (CA7 1982) (same);\nNLRB v. Seine & Line Fishermen, 374 F. 2d 974, 981 (CA9\n1967) (same).\n  To say that the claimant has the “burden” of showing\nthat an error was harmful is not to impose a complex\nsystem of “burden shifting” rules or a particularly onerous\nrequirement. In ordinary civil appeals, for example, the\nappellant will point to rulings by the trial judge that the\nappellant claims are erroneous, say, a ruling excluding\nfavorable evidence. Often the circumstances of the case\nwill make clear to the appellate judge that the ruling, if\nerroneous, was harmful and nothing further need be said.\nBut, if not, then the party seeking reversal normally must\nexplain why the erroneous ruling caused harm. If, for\nexample, the party seeking an affirmance makes a strong\nargument that the evidence on the point was overwhelm\ning regardless, it normally makes sense to ask the party\nseeking reversal to provide an explanation, say, by mar\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nshaling the facts and evidence showing the contrary. The\nparty seeking to reverse the result of a civil proceeding\nwill likely be in a position at least as good as, and often\nbetter than, the opposing party to explain how he has been\nhurt by an error. Cf. United States v. Fior D’Italia, Inc.,\n536 U. S. 238, 256, n. 4 (2002) (SOUTER, J., dissenting).\n  Respondents urge the creation of a special rule for this\ncontext, placing upon the agency the burden of proving\nthat a notice error did not cause harm. But we have\nplaced such a burden on the appellee only when the mat\nter underlying review was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos,\n328 U. S., at 760. In criminal cases the Government seeks\nto deprive an individual of his liberty, thereby providing a\ngood reason to require the Government to explain why an\nerror should not upset the trial court’s determination.\nAnd the fact that the Government must prove its case\nbeyond a reasonable doubt justifies a rule that makes it\nmore difficult for the reviewing court to find that an error\ndid not affect the outcome of a case. See United States v.\nOlano, 507 U. S. 725, 741 (1993) (stating that the Gov\nernment bears the “burden of showing the absence of\nprejudice”). But in the ordinary civil case that is not so.\nSee Palmer, supra, at 116.\n                              C\n  Our discussion above is subject to two important qualifi\ncations. First, we need not, and we do not, decide the\nlawfulness of the use by the Veterans Court of what it\ncalled the “natural effects” of certain kinds of notice er\nrors. We have previously made clear that courts may\nsometimes make empirically based generalizations about\nwhat kinds of errors are likely, as a factual matter, to\nprove harmful. See Kotteakos, supra, at 760–761 (review\ning courts may learn over time that the “ ‘natural effect’ ”\nof certain errors is “ ‘to prejudice a litigant’s substantial\nrights’ ” (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 913, 65th Cong., 3d Sess.,\n14                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\np. 1 (1919))). And by drawing upon “experience” that\nreveals some such “ ‘natural effect,’ ” a court might prop\nerly influence, though not control, future determinations.\nSee Kotteakos, supra, at 760–761. We consider here,\nhowever, only the Federal Circuit’s harmless-error frame\nwork. That framework, as we have said, is mandatory.\nAnd its presumptions are not based upon an effort to\ndetermine “natural effects.”\n   Indeed, the Federal Circuit is the wrong court to make\nsuch determinations. Statutes limit the Federal Circuit’s\nreview to certain kinds of Veterans Court errors, namely,\nthose that concern “the validity of . . . any statute or regu\nlation . . . or any interpretation thereof.” 38 U. S. C.\n§7292. But the factors that inform a reviewing court’s\n“harmless-error” determination are various, potentially\ninvolving, among other case-specific factors, an estimation\nof the likelihood that the result would have been different,\nan awareness of what body (jury, lower court, administra\ntive agency) has the authority to reach that result, a con\nsideration of the error’s likely effects on the perceived\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed\nings, and a hesitancy to generalize too broadly about\nparticular kinds of errors when the specific factual cir\ncumstances in which the error arises may well make all\nthe difference. See Neder, 527 U. S., at 18–19; Kotteakos,\nsupra, at 761–763; Traynor 33–37.\n   It is the Veterans Court, not the Federal Circuit, that\nsees sufficient case-specific raw material in veterans’ cases\nto enable it to make empirically based, nonbinding gener\nalizations about “natural effects.” And the Veterans\nCourt, which has exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, is\nlikely better able than is the Federal Circuit to exercise an\ninformed judgment as to how often veterans are harmed\nby which kinds of notice errors. Cf. United States v. Hag\ngar Apparel Co., 526 U. S. 380, 394 (1999) (Article I court’s\nspecial “expertise . . . guides it in making complex deter\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nminations in a specialized area of the law”).\n   Second, we recognize that Congress has expressed spe\ncial solicitude for the veterans’ cause. See post, at 2\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting). A veteran, after all, has per\nformed an especially important service for the Nation,\noften at the risk of his or her own life. And Congress has\nmade clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency. Rather,\nthe VA has a statutory duty to help the veteran develop\nhis or her benefits claim. See Veterans Claims Assistance\nAct of 2000, 38 U. S. C. §5103A. Moreover, the adjudica\ntory process is not truly adversarial, and the veteran is\noften unrepresented during the claims proceedings. See\nWalters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473\nU. S. 305, 311 (1985). These facts might lead a reviewing\ncourt to consider harmful in a veteran’s case error that it\nmight consider harmless in other circumstances. But that\nis not the question before us. And we need not here decide\nwhether, or to what extent, that may be so.\n                              III\n  We have considered the two cases before us in light of\nthe principles discussed. In Sanders’ case, the Veterans\nCourt found the notice error harmless. And after review\ning the record, we conclude that finding is lawful. The VA\ntold Sanders what further evidence would be needed to\nsubstantiate his claim. It failed to specify what portion of\nany additional evidence the Secretary would provide (we\nimagine none) and what portion Sanders would have to\nprovide (we imagine all).\n  How could the VA’s failure to specify this (or any other)\ndivision of labor have mattered? Sanders has pursued his\nclaim for over six decades; he has had numerous medical\nexaminations; and he should be aware of the respect in\nwhich his benefits claim is deficient (namely, his inability\nto show that his disability is connected to his World War II\nservice). See supra, at 5. Sanders has not told the Veter\n16                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nans Court, the Federal Circuit, or this Court, what specific\nadditional evidence proper notice would have led him to\nobtain or seek. He has not explained to the Veterans\nCourt, to the Federal Circuit, or to us, how the notice error\nto which he points could have made any difference. The\nVeterans Court did not consider the harmlessness issue a\nborderline question. Nor do we. We consequently reverse\nthe Federal Circuit’s judgment and remand the case so\nthat the court can reinstate the judgment of the Veterans\nCourt.\n   Simmons’ case is more difficult. The Veterans Court\nfound that the VA had committed a Type One error, i.e., a\nfailure to tell Simmons what information or evidence she\nmust provide to substantiate her claim. The VA sent\nSimmons a letter that provided her only with general\ninformation about how to prove a claim while telling her\nnothing at all about how to proceed further in her own\ncase, a case in which the question was whether a conced\nedly service-connected left-ear hearing problem had dete\nriorated to the point where it was compensable. And the\nVA did so in the context of having arranged for a further\nright-ear medical examination, which (because of lack of\nnotice) Simmons failed to attend. The Veterans Court\ntook the “natural effect” of a Type One error into account\nwhile also reviewing the record as a whole.\n   Some features of the record suggest the error was harm\nless, for example, the fact that Simmons has long sought\nbenefits and has a long history of medical examinations.\nBut other features—e.g., the fact that her left-ear hearing\nloss was concededly service connected and has continu\nously deteriorated over time, and the fact that the VA had\nscheduled a further examination of her right ear that (had\nnotice been given) might have revealed further left-ear\nhearing loss—suggest the opposite. Given the uncertain\nties, we believe it is appropriate to remand this case so\nthat the Veterans Court can decide whether re\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §7261(b)(2). We reverse the\nFederal Circuit’s judgment in Sanders’ case, and we va\ncate its judgment in Simmons’ case. We remand both\ncases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §7261(b)(2). Under this provision,\nwhen the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) fails to\nnotify a veteran of the information needed to support his\nbenefit claim, as required by 38 U. S. C. §5103(a), must\nthe veteran prove the error harmful, or must the VA prove\nits error harmless? The Federal Circuit held that the VA\nshould bear the burden. Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F. 3d\n881 (2007). The Court reverses because the Federal Cir\ncuit’s approach is “complex, rigid, and mandatory,” ante,\nat 9, “imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden upon\nthe VA,” ante, at 10–11, and contradicts the rule in other\ncivil and administrative cases by “requir[ing] the VA, not\nthe claimant, to explain why the error is harmless,” ante,\nat 11. I respectfully disagree.\n   Taking the last point first, the Court assumes that there\nis a standard allocation of the burden of proving harm\nlessness that Congress meant to adopt in directing the\nVeterans Court to “take due account of the rule of prejudi\n2                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncial error.” 38 U. S. C. §7261(b)(2). But as both the major\nity and the Government concede, “[t]here are no hard-and\nfast standards governing the allocation of the burden of\nproof in every situation,” Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Den\nver, 413 U. S. 189, 209 (1973), and courts impose the\nburden of dealing with harmlessness differently in differ\nent circumstances. As the Court says, the burden is on\nthe Government in criminal cases, ante, at 13, and even in\ncivil and administrative appeals courts sometimes require\nthe party getting the benefit of the error to show its harm\nlessness, depending on the statutory setting or specific\nsort of mistake made, see, e.g., McLouth Steel Prods. Corp.\nv. Thomas, 838 F. 2d 1317, 1324 (CADC 1988) (declaring\nthat imposing the burden of proving harm “on the chal\nlenger is normally inappropriate where the agency has\ncompletely failed to comply with” notice and comment\nprocedures).\n   Thus, the question is whether placing the burden of\npersuasion on the veteran is in order under the statutory\nscheme governing the VA. I believe it is not. The VA\ndiffers from virtually every other agency in being itself\nobliged to help the claimant develop his claim, see, e.g., 38\nU. S. C. §5103A, and a number of other provisions and\npractices of the VA’s administrative and judicial review\nprocess reflect a congressional policy to favor the veteran,\nsee, e.g., §5107(b) (“[T]he Secretary shall give the benefit\nof the doubt to the claimant” whenever “there is an ap\nproximate balance of positive and negative evidence re\ngarding any issue material to the determination of a mat\nter”); §7252(a) (allowing the veteran, but not the\nSecretary, to appeal an adverse decision to the Veterans\nCourt). Given Congress’s understandable decision to place\na thumb on the scale in the veteran’s favor in the course of\nadministrative and judicial review of VA decisions, I\nwould not remove a comparable benefit in the Veteran’s\nCourt based on the ambiguous directive of §7261(b)(2).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nAnd even if there were a question in my mind, I would\ncome out the same way under our longstanding “rule that\ninterpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran’s favor.”\nBrown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n    The majority’s other arguments are open to judgment,\nbut I do not see that placing the burden of showing harm\non the VA goes so far as to create a “complex, rigid, and\nmandatory” scheme, ante, at 9, or to impose “an unreason\nable evidentiary burden upon the VA,” ante, at 10–11.\nUnder the Federal Circuit’s rule, the VA simply “must\npersuade the reviewing court that the purpose of the\nnotice was not frustrated, e.g., by demonstrating: (1) that\nany defect was cured by actual knowledge on the part of\nthe claimant, (2) that a reasonable person could be ex\npected to understand from the notice what was needed, or\n(3) that a benefit could not have been awarded as a matter\nof law.” Sanders, supra, at 889. This gives the VA several\nways to show that an error was harmless, and the VA has\nbeen able to shoulder the burden in a number of cases.\nSee, e.g., Holmes v. Peake, No. 06–0852, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">974728</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n*2 (Vet.

It has the added virtue of giving the VA a\nstrong incentive to comply with its notice obligations,\nobligations “that g[o] to the very essence of the nonadver\nsarial, pro-claimant nature of the VA adjudication system\n. . . by affording a claimant a meaningful opportunity to\nparticipate effectively in the processing of his or her\nclaim.” Mayfield v.

Argued December 8, 2008—Decided April 21, 2009*\nAs part of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) statutory duty to\n  help a veteran develop a benefits claim, the Secretary of Veterans Af\n  fairs (Secretary) must notify an applicant of any information or evi\n  dence that is necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 U. S. C.\n  §5103(a). VA regulations require the notice to specify (1) what fur\n  ther information is necessary, (2) what portions of that information\n  the VA will obtain, and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.\n  These requirements are referred to as Type One, Type Two, and Type\n  Three, respectively.\n     The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), which\n  hears initial appeals from VA claims decisions, has a statutory duty\n  to “take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.” §7261(b)(2). It\n  has developed a system for dealing with notice errors, whereby a\n  claimant arguing that the VA failed to give proper notice must ex\n  plain precisely how the notice was defective. The reviewing judge\n  will then decide what “type” of notice error the VA committed. Under\n  the Veterans Court’s approach, a Type One error has the “natural ef\n  fect” of harming the claimant, but Types Two and Three errors do\n  not. In the latter instances, the claimant must show harm, e.g., by\n  describing what evidence he would have provided (or asked the Sec\n  retary to provide) had the notice not been defective, and explaining\n  just how the lack of that notice and evidence affected the adjudica\n  tion’s essential fairness.\n     The Federal Circuit, which reviews Veterans Court decisions, re\n——————\n  * Together with Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs v. Simmons,\nalso on certiorari to the same court (see this Court’s Rule 12.4).\n2                        SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    jected the Veterans Court’s approach and set forth its own framework\n    for determining whether a notice error is harmless. When the VA\n    provides a claimant with a notice that is deficient in any respect, the\n    framework requires the Veterans Court to presume that the error is\n    prejudicial and requires reversal unless the VA can demonstrate (1)\n    that the defect was cured by the claimant’s actual knowledge or (2)\n    that benefits could not have been awarded as a matter of law. The\n    Federal Circuit applied its framework in both of the present cases.\n       In respondent Sanders’ case, the VA denied disability benefits on\n    the ground that Sanders’ disability, blindness in his right eye, was\n    not related to his military service. Sanders argued to the Veterans\n    Court that the VA had made notice errors Type Two and Type Three\n    when it informed him what further information was necessary, but\n    failed to tell him which portions of that information the Secretary\n    would provide and which portions he would have to provide. The\n    Veterans Court held these notice errors harmless, but the Federal\n    Circuit reversed, ruling that the VA had not made the necessary\n    claimant-knowledge or benefits-ineligibilty showing required by the\n    Federal Circuit’s framework.\n       The VA also denied benefits in respondent Simmons’ case after\n    finding that her left-ear hearing loss, while service connected, was\n    not severe enough to warrant compensation. Simmons argued to the\n    Veterans Court, inter alia, that the VA had made a Type One notice\n    error by failing to notify her of the information necessary to show\n    worsening of her hearing. The court agreed, finding the error preju\n    dicial. Noting that a Type One notice error has the “natural effect” of\n    producing prejudice, the Veterans Court added that its review of the\n    record convinced it that Simmons did not have actual knowledge of\n    what evidence was necessary to substantiate her claim and, had the\n    VA told her more specifically what additional information was\n    needed, she might have obtained that evidence. The Federal Circuit\n    affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Circuit’s harmless-error framework conflicts with\n §7261(b)(2)’s requirement that the Veterans Court take “due account\n of the rule of prejudicial error.” Pp. 8–15.\n       (a) That §7261(b)(2) requires the same sort of “harmless-error”\n rule as is ordinarily applied in civil cases is shown by the statutory\n words “take due account” and “prejudicial error.” Congress used the\n same words in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.\n §706, which is an “ ‘administrative law . . . harmless error rule,’ ” Na\n tional Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644,\n ___. Legislative history confirms that Congress intended §7261(b)(2)\n to incorporate the APA’s approach. Pp. 8–9.\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n      (b) Three related features, taken together, demonstrate that the\nFederal Circuit’s framework mandates an approach to harmless error\nthat differs significantly from the one normally taken in civil cases.\nFirst, the framework is too complex and rigid: In every case involving\nany type of notice error, the Veterans Court must find the error\nharmful unless the VA demonstrates the claimant’s actual knowledge\ncuring the defect or his ineligibility for benefits as a matter of law.\nAn error’s harmlessness should not be determined through the use of\nmandatory presumptions and rigid rules, but through the case\nspecific application of judgment, based upon examination of the re\ncord. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760. Second, the\nframework imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden on the VA,\nrequiring the Secretary to demonstrate, e.g., a claimant’s state of\nmind about what he knew or the nonexistence of evidence that might\nsignificantly help the claimant. Third, the framework requires the\nVA, not the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless. The bur\nden of showing harmfulness is normally on the party attacking an\nagency’s determination. See, e.g., Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109,\n116. This Court has placed the burden on the Government only when\nthe underlying matter was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos, supra, at\n760. The good reasons for this rule do not apply in the ordinary civil\ncase. Pp. 9–13.\n      (c) The foregoing analysis is subject to two important qualifica\ntions. First, the Court need not, and does not, decide the lawfulness\nof the Veterans Court’s reliance on the “natural effects” of certain\nkinds of notice errors. Second, although Congress’ special solicitude\nfor veterans might lead a reviewing court to consider harmful in a\nveteran’s case error that it might consider harmless in other cases,\nthat is not at issue, and need not be decided here. Pp. 13–15.\n   2. In Sanders’ case, a review of the record demonstrates that the\nVeterans Court lawfully found the notice errors harmless. The VA’s\nTypes Two and Three notice errors did not matter, given that Sand\ners has pursued his claim for many years and should be aware of why\nhe has been unable to show that his disability is service connected.\nSanders has not told the reviewing courts what additional evidence\nproper notice would have led him to obtain or seek and has not ex\nplained how the notice errors could have made any difference.\n   In Simmons’ case, some features of the record suggest that the VA’s\nType One error was harmless, e.g., that she has long sought benefits\nand has a long history of medical examinations. But other features,\ne.g., that her left-ear hearing loss was concededly service connected\nand has continuously deteriorated over time, suggest the opposite.\nGiven the uncertainties, the Veterans Court should decide whether\nreconsideration is necessary.

SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n\n  AFFAIRS, PETITIONER v. WOODROW F. SANDERS\n\n   ERIC K. SHINSEKI, SECRETARY OF VETERANS \n\n  AFFAIRS, PETITIONER v. PATRICIA D. SIMMONS \n\nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n          APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n                                 [April 21, 2009]\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In these two civil cases, the Department of Veterans\nAffairs (VA) denied veterans’ claims for disability benefits.\nIn both cases the VA erroneously failed to provide the\nveteran with a certain kind of statutorily required notice.\nSee 38 U. S. C. §5103(a). In both cases the VA argued that\nthe error was harmless. And in both cases the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit, after setting forth a\nframework for determining whether a notice error is\nharmless, rejected the VA’s argument.\n  In our view, the Federal Circuit’s “harmless-error”\nframework is too complex and rigid, its presumptions\nimpose unreasonable evidentiary burdens upon the VA,\nand it is too likely too often to require the Court of Appeals\nfor Veterans Claims (Veterans Court) to treat as harmful\nerrors that in fact are harmless. We conclude that the\nframework conflicts with established law. See §7261(b)(2)\n(Veterans Court must “take due account of the rule of\nprejudicial error”).\n2                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   The law entitles veterans who have served on active\nduty in the United States military to receive benefits for\ndisabilities caused or aggravated by their military service.\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the\nVA to help a veteran develop his or her benefits claim.\n§5103A. In doing so, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n(Secretary), upon “receipt of” an “application” for benefits,\nmust “notify the claimant . . . of any information, and any\nmedical or lay evidence, not previously provided to the\nSecretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.” As\n“part of” the required “notice,” the Secretary must also\n“indicate which portion of” the required “information and\nevidence . . . is to be provided by the claimant and which\nportion . . . the Secretary . . . will attempt to obtain.”\n§5103(a).\n   Repeating these statutory requirements in its regula\ntions, the VA has said it will provide a claimant with a\nletter that tells the claimant (1) what further information\nis necessary to substantiate his or her claim; (2) what\nportions of that information the VA will obtain for the\nclaimant; and (3) what portions the claimant must obtain.\n38 CFR §3.159(b) (2008). At the time of the decisions\nbelow, the regulations also required the VA to tell the\nclaimant (4) that he may submit any other relevant infor\nmation that he has available. §3.159(b)(1). (The VA refers\nto these notice requirements as Type One, Type Two, Type\nThree, and Type Four, respectively.)\n                            B\n  The VA’s regional offices decide most claims. A claim\nant may appeal an adverse regional office decision to the\nVA’s Board of Veterans’ Appeals, an administrative board\nwith the power to consider certain types of new evidence.\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)              3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n38 U. S. C. §§7107(b), 7109(a); 38 CFR §20.1304(c). The\nclaimant may seek review of an adverse Board decision in\nthe Veterans Court, an Article I court. And the claimant\n(or the Government) may appeal an adverse decision of the\nVeterans Court to the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit—but only in respect to certain legal matters,\nnamely, “the validity . . . of any statute or regulation . . . or\nany interpretation thereof . . . that was relied on” by the\nVeterans Court in making its decision. 38 U. S. C. §7292.\n  A specific statute requires the Veterans Court to “take\ndue account of the rule of prejudicial error.” §7261(b)(2).\nIn applying this statutory provision, the Veterans Court\nhas developed its own special framework for notice errors.\nUnder this framework, a claimant who argues that the VA\nfailed to give proper notice must explain precisely how the\nnotice was defective. Then the reviewing judge will decide\nwhat “type” of notice error the VA committed. The Veter\nans Court has gone on to say that a Type One error (i.e., a\nfailure to explain what further information is needed) has\nthe “natural effect” of harming the claimant; but errors of\nTypes Two, Three, or Four (i.e., a failure to explain just\nwho, claimant or agency, must provide the needed mate\nrial or to tell the veteran that he may submit any other\nevidence available) do not have the “natural effect” of\nharming the claimant. In these latter instances, the\nclaimant must show how the error caused harm, for ex\nample, by stating in particular just “what evidence” he\nwould have provided (or asked the Secretary to provide)\nhad the notice not been defective, and explaining just “how\nthe lack of that notice and evidence affected the essential\nfairness of the adjudication.” Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19\nVet. App. 103, 121 (2005).\n                           C\n  In the first case, Woodrow Sanders, a veteran of World\nWar II, claimed that a bazooka exploded near his face in\n4                   SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1944, causing later blindness in his right eye. His war\ntime medical records, however, did not indicate any eye\nproblems. Indeed, his 1945 discharge examination showed\nnear-perfect vision. But a 1948 eye examination revealed\nan inflammation of the right-eye retina and surrounding\ntissues—a condition that eventually left him nearly blind\nin that eye. Soon after the examination Sanders filed a\nclaim for disability benefits. But in 1949 the VA denied\nbenefits on the ground that Sanders had failed to show a\nconnection between his eye condition and his earlier mili\ntary service.\n   Forty-two years later, Sanders asked the VA to reopen\nhis benefits claim. He argued that the 1944 bazooka\nexplosion had hurt his eye, and added that that he had\nbegun to experience symptoms—blurred vision, swelling,\nand loss of sight—in 1946. He included a report from a\nVA doctor, Dr. Joseph Ruda, who said that “[i]t is not\ninconceivable that” the condition “could have occurred\nsecondary to trauma, as stated by” Sanders. A private\nophthalmologist, Dr. Gregory Strainer, confirming that\nSanders’ right retina was scarred, added that this “[t]ype\nof . . . injury . . . can certainly be concussive in character.”\nApp. C to Pet. for Cert. 26a–27a.\n   In 1992, the VA reopened Sanders’ claim. Id., at 29a.\nAfter obtaining Sanders’ military medical records, the VA\narranged for a further medical examination, this time by\nVA eye specialist Dr. Sheila Anderson. After examining\nSanders’ medical history (including records of the exami\nnations made at the time of Sanders’ enlistment and\ndischarge), Anderson agreed with the medical diagnosis\nbut concluded that Sanders’ condition was not service\nrelated. Since Sanders’ right-eye “visual acuity” was\n“20/20” upon enlistment and “20/25” upon discharge, and\nhe had “reported decreased vision only 6 months prior” to\nhis 1948 doctor’s “visit,” and since “there are no other\nsigns of ocular trauma,” Anderson thought that Sanders’\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncondition “is most likely infectious in nature, although the\netiology at this point is impossible to determine.” “Based\non the documented records,” she concluded, “the patient\ndid not lose vision while on active duty.” The VA regional\noffice denied Sanders’ claim. Ibid.\n   Sanders sought Board review, and in the meantime he\nobtained the opinion of another VA doctor, Dr. Duane Nii,\nwho said that the “etiology of the patient’s” eye condition\n“is . . . difficult to ascertain.” He thought that “it is possi\nble that” the condition “could be related to” a bazooka\nexplosion, though the “possibility of” an infection “as the\netiology . . . could also be entertained.” Id., at 30a. The\nBoard concluded that Sanders had failed to show that the\neye injury was service connected. The Board said that it\nhad relied most heavily upon Anderson’s report because,\nunlike other reports, it took account of Sanders’ military\nmedical records documenting his eyesight at the time of\nhis enlistment and discharge. And the Board conse\nquently affirmed the regional office’s denial of Sanders’\nclaim.\n   Sanders then appealed to the Veterans Court. There he\nargued, among other things, that the VA had made a\nnotice error. Sanders conceded that the VA had sent him\na letter telling him (1) what further information was\nnecessary to substantiate his claim. But, he said, the VA\nletter did not tell him (2) which portions of the information\nthe Secretary would provide or (3) which portions he\nwould have to provide. That is to say, he complained\nabout notice errors Type Two and Type Three.\n   The Veterans Court held that these notice errors were\nharmless. It said that Sanders had not explained how he\nwould have acted differently, say, by identifying what\ndifferent evidence he would have produced or asked the\nSecretary to obtain for him, had he received proper notice.\nFinding no other error, the Veterans Court affirmed the\nBoard’s decision.\n6                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             D\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed\nthe Veterans Court’s decision and held that the Veterans\nCourt was wrong to find the notice error harmless. The\nFederal Circuit wrote that when the VA provides a claim\nant with a notice letter that is deficient in any respect (to\nthe point where a “reasonable person” would not have read\nit as providing the necessary information), the Veterans\nCourt “should . . . presum[e]” that the notice error is\n“prejudicial, requiring reversal unless the VA can show\nthat the error did not affect the essential fairness of the\nadjudication.” Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F. 3d 881, 889\n(2007). To make this latter showing, the court added, the\nVA must “demonstrate” (1) that the “defect was cured by\nactual knowledge on the” claimant’s “part,” or (2) “that a\nbenefit could not have been awarded as a matter of law.”\nIbid. Because the VA had not made such a showing, the\nFederal Circuit reversed the Veterans Court’s decision.\n                             E\n  In the second case before us, the claimant, Patricia\nSimmons, served on active military duty from December\n1978 to April 1980. While on duty she worked in a noisy\nenvironment close to aircraft; after three months she\nbegan to lose hearing in her left ear; and by the time she\nwas discharged, her left-ear hearing had become worse.\nSoon after her discharge, Simmons applied for disability\nbenefits. The VA regional office found her hearing loss\nwas service connected; but it also found the loss insuffi\nciently severe to warrant compensation. In November\n1980, it denied her claim.\n  In 1998, Simmons asked the VA to reopen her claim.\nShe provided medical examination records showing fur\nther loss of hearing in her left ear along with (what she\nconsidered related) loss of hearing in her right ear. The\nVA arranged for hearing examinations by VA doctors in\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1999, 2001, and 2002. The doctors measured her left-ear\nhearing loss, ranking it as moderate to severe; they also\nmeasured her right-ear hearing loss, ranking it as mild to\nmoderate. After comparing the results of the examina\ntions with a VA hearing-loss compensation schedule, the\nregional office concluded that Simmons’ left-ear hearing\nloss, while service connected, was not severe enough to\nwarrant compensation. At the same time, the regional\noffice concluded that her right-ear hearing loss was nei\nther service connected nor sufficiently severe. Simmons\nappealed the decision to the Board, which affirmed the\nregional office’s determination.\n   In 2003, Simmons appealed to the Veterans Court.\nAmong other things, she said that she had not received a\nnotice about (and she consequently failed to attend) a\nfurther right-ear medical examination that the VA later\ntold her it had arranged. She added that, in respect to her\nclaim for benefits for loss of hearing in her left ear, the VA\nhad made a Type One notice error (i.e., it had failed to tell\nher what further information was needed to substantiate\nher claim). Simmons conceded that she had received a\nletter from the VA. But the letter told her only what, in\ngeneral, a person had to do to show that a hearing injury\nwas service connected. It did not tell her anything about\nher specific problem, namely, what further information\nshe must provide to show a worsening of hearing in her\nleft ear, to the point where she could receive benefits.\n   The Veterans Court agreed with Simmons, and it found\nboth errors prejudicial. In respect to Simmons’ left-ear\nhearing loss (the matter at issue here), it pointed out that\nit had earlier said (in Mayfield, 19 Vet. App., at 120–124)\nthat a Type One notice error has the “natural effect of\nproducing prejudice.” The court added that its “revie[w]\n[of] the record in its entirety” convinced it that Simmons\ndid not have “actual knowledge of what evidence was\nnecessary to substantiate her claim” and, had the VA told\n8                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSimmons more specifically about what additional medical\ninformation it needed, Simmons might have “obtained” a\nfurther “private” medical “examination substantiating her\nclaim.” App. G to Pet. for Cert. 81a. The Veterans Court\nconsequently remanded the case to the Board.\n  The Government appealed the Veterans Court’s deter\nmination to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nAnd that court affirmed the Veterans Court’s decision on\nthe basis of its decision in Sanders. Simmons v. Nichol\nson, 487 F. 3d 892 (2007).\n                             F\n  We granted certiorari in both Sanders’ and Simmons’\ncases in order to determine the lawfulness of the Federal\nCircuit’s “harmless-error” holdings.\n                             II\n   The Federal Circuit’s holdings flow directly from its use\nof the “harmless-error” framework that we have described.\nSupra, at 6. Thus we must decide whether that frame\nwork is consistent with a particular statutory require\nment, namely, the requirement that the Veterans Court\n“take due account of the rule of prejudicial error,”\n38 U. S. C. §7261(b)(2). See supra, at 3. We conclude\nthat the framework is not consistent with the statutory\ndemand.\n                             A\n  We believe that the statute, in stating that the Veterans\nCourt must “take due account of the rule of prejudicial\nerror,” requires the Veterans Court to apply the same kind\nof “harmless-error” rule that courts ordinarily apply in\ncivil cases. The statutory words “take due account” and\n“prejudicial error” make clear that is so. Congress used\nthe same words in the Administrative Procedure Act\n(APA). 5 U. S. C. §706 (“[A] court shall review the whole\nrecord . . . and due account shall be taken of the rule of\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The Attorney General’s Manual on the\nAdministrative Procedure Act explained that the APA’s\nreference to “prejudicial error” is intended to “su[m] up in\nsuccinct fashion the ‘harmless error’ rule applied by the\ncourts in the review of lower court decisions as well as of\nadministrative bodies.” Dept. of Justice, Attorney Gen\neral’s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 110\n(1947) (emphasis added). And we have previously de\nscribed §706 as an “ ‘administrative law . . . harmless error\nrule.’ ” National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nPDK Labs. Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement\nAdmin., 362 F. 3d 786, 799 (CADC 2004)). Legislative\nhistory confirms that Congress intended the Veterans\nCourt “prejudicial error” statute to “incorporate a refer\nence” to the APA’s approach. S. Rep. No. 100–418, p. 61\n(1988). We have no indication of any relevant distinction\nbetween the manner in which reviewing courts treat civil\nand administrative cases. Consequently, we assess the\nlawfulness of the Federal Circuit’s approach in light of our\ngeneral case law governing application of the harmless\nerror standard.\n                            B\n  Three related features of the Federal Circuit’s frame\nwork, taken together, convince us that it mandates an\napproach to harmless error that differs significantly from\nthe approach courts normally take in ordinary civil cases.\nFirst, the framework is complex, rigid, and mandatory. In\nevery case involving a notice error (of no matter which\nkind) the Veterans Court must find the error harmful\nunless the VA “demonstrate[s]” (1) that the claimant’s\n“actual knowledge” cured the defect or (2) that the claim\nant could not have received a benefit as a matter of law.\nSuppose the notice error, as in Sanders’ case, consisted of\na failure to describe what additional information, if any,\n10                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe VA would provide. It might be obvious from the record\nin the particular case that the error made no difference.\nBut under the Federal Circuit’s rule, the Veterans Court\nwould have to remand the case for new proceedings\nregardless.\n   We have previously warned against courts’ determining\nwhether an error is harmless through the use of manda\ntory presumptions and rigid rules rather than case-specific\napplication of judgment, based upon examination of the\nrecord. See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 760\n(1946). The federal “harmless-error” statute, now codified\nat 28 U. S. C. §2111, tells courts to review cases for errors\nof law “without regard to errors” that do not affect the\nparties’ “substantial rights.” That language seeks to\nprevent appellate courts from becoming “ ‘ impregnable\ncitadels of technicality, ’ ” Kotteakos, 328 U. S., at 759. And\nwe have read it as expressing a congressional preference\nfor determining “harmless error” without the use of pre\nsumptions insofar as those presumptions may lead courts\nto find an error harmful, when, in fact, in the particular\ncase before the court, it is not. See id., at 760; O’Neal v.\nMcAninch, 513 U. S. 432, 436–437 (1995); see also R.\nTraynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 26 (1970) (herein\nafter Traynor) (reviewing court normally should “deter\nmine whether the error affected the judgment . . . without\nbenefit of such aids as presumptions . . . that expedite fact\nfinding at trial ”).\n   The Federal Circuit’s presumptions exhibit the very\ncharacteristics that Congress sought to discourage. In the\ncases before us, they would prevent the reviewing court\nfrom directly asking the harmless-error question. They\nwould prevent that court from resting its conclusion on the\nfacts and circumstances of the particular case. And they\nwould require the reviewing court to find the notice error\nprejudicial even if that court, having read the entire re\ncord, conscientiously concludes the contrary.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Second, the Federal Circuit’s framework imposes an\nunreasonable evidentiary burden upon the VA. How is the\nSecretary to demonstrate, in Sanders’ case for example,\nthat Sanders knew that he, not the VA, would have to\nproduce more convincing evidence that the bazooka acci\ndent caused his eye injury? How could the Secretary\ndemonstrate that there is no evidence anywhere that\nwould entitle Sanders to benefits? To show a claimant’s\nstate of mind about such a matter will often prove diffi\ncult, perhaps impossible. And even if the VA (as in Sand\ners’ case) searches the military records and comes up\nemptyhanded, it may still prove difficult, or impossible, to\nprove the nonexistence of evidence lying somewhere about\nthat might significantly help the claimant.\n   We have previously pointed out that setting an eviden\ntiary “barrier so high that it could never be surmounted\nwould justify the very criticism that spawned the harm\nless-error doctrine,” namely, reversing for error “ ‘regard\nless of its effect on the judgment.’ ” Neder v. United States,\n527 U. S. 1, 18 (1999) (quoting Traynor 50). The Federal\nCircuit’s evidentiary rules increase the likelihood of rever\nsal in cases where, in fact, the error is harmless. And, as\nwe pointed out in Neder, that likelihood encourages abuse\nof the judicial process and diminishes the public’s confi\ndence in the fair and effective operation of the judicial\nsystem. 527 U. S., at 18.\n   Third, the Federal Circuit’s framework requires the VA,\nnot the claimant, to explain why the error is harmless.\nThis Court has said that the party that “seeks to have a\njudgment set aside because of an erroneous ruling carries\nthe burden of showing that prejudice resulted.” Palmer v.\nHoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 116 (1943); see also Tipton v.\nSocony Mobil Oil Co., 375 U. S. 34, 36 (1963) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Borden Co., 347 U. S. 514, 516–517\n(1954); cf. McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Green\nwood, 464 U. S. 548, 553 (1984); Market Street R. Co. v.\n12                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRailroad Comm’n of Cal., 324 U. S. 548, 562 (1945) (find\ning error harmless “in the absence of any showing of . . .\nprejudice”).\n  Lower court cases make clear that courts have corre\nlated review of ordinary administrative proceedings to\nappellate review of civil cases in this respect. Conse\nquently, the burden of showing that an error is harmful\nnormally falls upon the party attacking the agency’s de\ntermination. See, e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Depart\nment of Transp., 202 F. 3d 788, 797 (CA5 2000) (declining\nto remand where appellant failed to show that error in\nadministrative proceeding was harmful); Air Canada v.\nDepartment of Transp., 148 F. 3d 1142, 1156–1157 (CADC\n1998) (same); Nelson v. Apfel, 131 F. 3d 1228, 1236 (CA7\n1997) (same); Bar MK Ranches v. Yuetter, 994 F. 2d 735,\n740 (CA10 1993) (same); Camden v. Department of Labor,\n831 F. 2d 449, 451 (CA3 1987) (same); Panhandle Co-op\nAssn. v. EPA, 771 F. 2d 1149, 1153 (CA8 1985) (same);\nFrankfort v. FERC, 678 F. 2d 699, 708 (CA7 1982) (same);\nNLRB v. Seine & Line Fishermen, 374 F. 2d 974, 981 (CA9\n1967) (same).\n  To say that the claimant has the “burden” of showing\nthat an error was harmful is not to impose a complex\nsystem of “burden shifting” rules or a particularly onerous\nrequirement. In ordinary civil appeals, for example, the\nappellant will point to rulings by the trial judge that the\nappellant claims are erroneous, say, a ruling excluding\nfavorable evidence. Often the circumstances of the case\nwill make clear to the appellate judge that the ruling, if\nerroneous, was harmful and nothing further need be said.\nBut, if not, then the party seeking reversal normally must\nexplain why the erroneous ruling caused harm. If, for\nexample, the party seeking an affirmance makes a strong\nargument that the evidence on the point was overwhelm\ning regardless, it normally makes sense to ask the party\nseeking reversal to provide an explanation, say, by mar\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nshaling the facts and evidence showing the contrary. The\nparty seeking to reverse the result of a civil proceeding\nwill likely be in a position at least as good as, and often\nbetter than, the opposing party to explain how he has been\nhurt by an error. Cf. United States v. Fior D’Italia, Inc.,\n536 U. S. 238, 256, n. 4 (2002) (SOUTER, J., dissenting).\n  Respondents urge the creation of a special rule for this\ncontext, placing upon the agency the burden of proving\nthat a notice error did not cause harm. But we have\nplaced such a burden on the appellee only when the mat\nter underlying review was criminal. See, e.g., Kotteakos,\n328 U. S., at 760. In criminal cases the Government seeks\nto deprive an individual of his liberty, thereby providing a\ngood reason to require the Government to explain why an\nerror should not upset the trial court’s determination.\nAnd the fact that the Government must prove its case\nbeyond a reasonable doubt justifies a rule that makes it\nmore difficult for the reviewing court to find that an error\ndid not affect the outcome of a case. See United States v.\nOlano, 507 U. S. 725, 741 (1993) (stating that the Gov\nernment bears the “burden of showing the absence of\nprejudice”). But in the ordinary civil case that is not so.\nSee Palmer, supra, at 116.\n                              C\n  Our discussion above is subject to two important qualifi\ncations. First, we need not, and we do not, decide the\nlawfulness of the use by the Veterans Court of what it\ncalled the “natural effects” of certain kinds of notice er\nrors. We have previously made clear that courts may\nsometimes make empirically based generalizations about\nwhat kinds of errors are likely, as a factual matter, to\nprove harmful. See Kotteakos, supra, at 760–761 (review\ning courts may learn over time that the “ ‘natural effect’ ”\nof certain errors is “ ‘to prejudice a litigant’s substantial\nrights’ ” (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 913, 65th Cong., 3d Sess.,\n14                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\np. 1 (1919))). And by drawing upon “experience” that\nreveals some such “ ‘natural effect,’ ” a court might prop\nerly influence, though not control, future determinations.\nSee Kotteakos, supra, at 760–761. We consider here,\nhowever, only the Federal Circuit’s harmless-error frame\nwork. That framework, as we have said, is mandatory.\nAnd its presumptions are not based upon an effort to\ndetermine “natural effects.”\n   Indeed, the Federal Circuit is the wrong court to make\nsuch determinations. Statutes limit the Federal Circuit’s\nreview to certain kinds of Veterans Court errors, namely,\nthose that concern “the validity of . . . any statute or regu\nlation . . . or any interpretation thereof.” 38 U. S. C.\n§7292. But the factors that inform a reviewing court’s\n“harmless-error” determination are various, potentially\ninvolving, among other case-specific factors, an estimation\nof the likelihood that the result would have been different,\nan awareness of what body (jury, lower court, administra\ntive agency) has the authority to reach that result, a con\nsideration of the error’s likely effects on the perceived\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed\nings, and a hesitancy to generalize too broadly about\nparticular kinds of errors when the specific factual cir\ncumstances in which the error arises may well make all\nthe difference. See Neder, 527 U. S., at 18–19; Kotteakos,\nsupra, at 761–763; Traynor 33–37.\n   It is the Veterans Court, not the Federal Circuit, that\nsees sufficient case-specific raw material in veterans’ cases\nto enable it to make empirically based, nonbinding gener\nalizations about “natural effects.” And the Veterans\nCourt, which has exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, is\nlikely better able than is the Federal Circuit to exercise an\ninformed judgment as to how often veterans are harmed\nby which kinds of notice errors. Cf. United States v. Hag\ngar Apparel Co., 526 U. S. 380, 394 (1999) (Article I court’s\nspecial “expertise . . . guides it in making complex deter\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nminations in a specialized area of the law”).\n   Second, we recognize that Congress has expressed spe\ncial solicitude for the veterans’ cause. See post, at 2\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting). A veteran, after all, has per\nformed an especially important service for the Nation,\noften at the risk of his or her own life. And Congress has\nmade clear that the VA is not an ordinary agency. Rather,\nthe VA has a statutory duty to help the veteran develop\nhis or her benefits claim. See Veterans Claims Assistance\nAct of 2000, 38 U. S. C. §5103A. Moreover, the adjudica\ntory process is not truly adversarial, and the veteran is\noften unrepresented during the claims proceedings. See\nWalters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors, 473\nU. S. 305, 311 (1985). These facts might lead a reviewing\ncourt to consider harmful in a veteran’s case error that it\nmight consider harmless in other circumstances. But that\nis not the question before us. And we need not here decide\nwhether, or to what extent, that may be so.\n                              III\n  We have considered the two cases before us in light of\nthe principles discussed. In Sanders’ case, the Veterans\nCourt found the notice error harmless. And after review\ning the record, we conclude that finding is lawful. The VA\ntold Sanders what further evidence would be needed to\nsubstantiate his claim. It failed to specify what portion of\nany additional evidence the Secretary would provide (we\nimagine none) and what portion Sanders would have to\nprovide (we imagine all).\n  How could the VA’s failure to specify this (or any other)\ndivision of labor have mattered? Sanders has pursued his\nclaim for over six decades; he has had numerous medical\nexaminations; and he should be aware of the respect in\nwhich his benefits claim is deficient (namely, his inability\nto show that his disability is connected to his World War II\nservice). See supra, at 5. Sanders has not told the Veter\n16                 SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nans Court, the Federal Circuit, or this Court, what specific\nadditional evidence proper notice would have led him to\nobtain or seek. He has not explained to the Veterans\nCourt, to the Federal Circuit, or to us, how the notice error\nto which he points could have made any difference. The\nVeterans Court did not consider the harmlessness issue a\nborderline question. Nor do we. We consequently reverse\nthe Federal Circuit’s judgment and remand the case so\nthat the court can reinstate the judgment of the Veterans\nCourt.\n   Simmons’ case is more difficult. The Veterans Court\nfound that the VA had committed a Type One error, i.e., a\nfailure to tell Simmons what information or evidence she\nmust provide to substantiate her claim. The VA sent\nSimmons a letter that provided her only with general\ninformation about how to prove a claim while telling her\nnothing at all about how to proceed further in her own\ncase, a case in which the question was whether a conced\nedly service-connected left-ear hearing problem had dete\nriorated to the point where it was compensable. And the\nVA did so in the context of having arranged for a further\nright-ear medical examination, which (because of lack of\nnotice) Simmons failed to attend. The Veterans Court\ntook the “natural effect” of a Type One error into account\nwhile also reviewing the record as a whole.\n   Some features of the record suggest the error was harm\nless, for example, the fact that Simmons has long sought\nbenefits and has a long history of medical examinations.\nBut other features—e.g., the fact that her left-ear hearing\nloss was concededly service connected and has continu\nously deteriorated over time, and the fact that the VA had\nscheduled a further examination of her right ear that (had\nnotice been given) might have revealed further left-ear\nhearing loss—suggest the opposite. Given the uncertain\nties, we believe it is appropriate to remand this case so\nthat the Veterans Court can decide whether re\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §7261(b)(2). We reverse the\nFederal Circuit’s judgment in Sanders’ case, and we va\ncate its judgment in Simmons’ case. We remand both\ncases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §7261(b)(2). Under this provision,\nwhen the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) fails to\nnotify a veteran of the information needed to support his\nbenefit claim, as required by 38 U. S. C. §5103(a), must\nthe veteran prove the error harmful, or must the VA prove\nits error harmless? The Federal Circuit held that the VA\nshould bear the burden. Sanders v. Nicholson, 487 F. 3d\n881 (2007). The Court reverses because the Federal Cir\ncuit’s approach is “complex, rigid, and mandatory,” ante,\nat 9, “imposes an unreasonable evidentiary burden upon\nthe VA,” ante, at 10–11, and contradicts the rule in other\ncivil and administrative cases by “requir[ing] the VA, not\nthe claimant, to explain why the error is harmless,” ante,\nat 11. I respectfully disagree.\n   Taking the last point first, the Court assumes that there\nis a standard allocation of the burden of proving harm\nlessness that Congress meant to adopt in directing the\nVeterans Court to “take due account of the rule of prejudi\n2                  SHINSEKI v. SANDERS\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncial error.” 38 U. S. C. §7261(b)(2). But as both the major\nity and the Government concede, “[t]here are no hard-and\nfast standards governing the allocation of the burden of\nproof in every situation,” Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Den\nver, 413 U. S. 189, 209 (1973), and courts impose the\nburden of dealing with harmlessness differently in differ\nent circumstances. As the Court says, the burden is on\nthe Government in criminal cases, ante, at 13, and even in\ncivil and administrative appeals courts sometimes require\nthe party getting the benefit of the error to show its harm\nlessness, depending on the statutory setting or specific\nsort of mistake made, see, e.g., McLouth Steel Prods. Corp.\nv. Thomas, 838 F. 2d 1317, 1324 (CADC 1988) (declaring\nthat imposing the burden of proving harm “on the chal\nlenger is normally inappropriate where the agency has\ncompletely failed to comply with” notice and comment\nprocedures).\n   Thus, the question is whether placing the burden of\npersuasion on the veteran is in order under the statutory\nscheme governing the VA. I believe it is not. The VA\ndiffers from virtually every other agency in being itself\nobliged to help the claimant develop his claim, see, e.g., 38\nU. S. C. §5103A, and a number of other provisions and\npractices of the VA’s administrative and judicial review\nprocess reflect a congressional policy to favor the veteran,\nsee, e.g., §5107(b) (“[T]he Secretary shall give the benefit\nof the doubt to the claimant” whenever “there is an ap\nproximate balance of positive and negative evidence re\ngarding any issue material to the determination of a mat\nter”); §7252(a) (allowing the veteran, but not the\nSecretary, to appeal an adverse decision to the Veterans\nCourt). Given Congress’s understandable decision to place\na thumb on the scale in the veteran’s favor in the course of\nadministrative and judicial review of VA decisions, I\nwould not remove a comparable benefit in the Veteran’s\nCourt based on the ambiguous directive of §7261(b)(2).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nAnd even if there were a question in my mind, I would\ncome out the same way under our longstanding “rule that\ninterpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran’s favor.”\nBrown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n    The majority’s other arguments are open to judgment,\nbut I do not see that placing the burden of showing harm\non the VA goes so far as to create a “complex, rigid, and\nmandatory” scheme, ante, at 9, or to impose “an unreason\nable evidentiary burden upon the VA,” ante, at 10–11.\nUnder the Federal Circuit’s rule, the VA simply “must\npersuade the reviewing court that the purpose of the\nnotice was not frustrated, e.g., by demonstrating: (1) that\nany defect was cured by actual knowledge on the part of\nthe claimant, (2) that a reasonable person could be ex\npected to understand from the notice what was needed, or\n(3) that a benefit could not have been awarded as a matter\nof law.” Sanders, supra, at 889. This gives the VA several\nways to show that an error was harmless, and the VA has\nbeen able to shoulder the burden in a number of cases.\nSee, e.g., Holmes v. Peake, No. 06–0852, 2008 WL 974728,\n*2 (Vet. App., Apr. 3, 2008) (Table) (finding notice error\nharmless because the claimant had “actual knowledge of\nwhat was required to substantiate” his claim); Clark v.\nPeake, No. 05–2422, 2008 WL 852588, *4 (Vet. App., Mar.\n24, 2008) (Table) (same).\n    The Federal Circuit’s rule thus strikes me as workable\nand in keeping with the statutory scheme governing vet\nerans’ benefits. It has the added virtue of giving the VA a\nstrong incentive to comply with its notice obligations,\nobligations “that g[o] to the very essence of the nonadver\nsarial, pro-claimant nature of the VA adjudication system\n. . . by affording a claimant a meaningful opportunity to\nparticipate effectively in the processing of his or her\nclaim.” Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103, 120–121\n(2005).\n    I would affirm the Federal Circuit and respectfully\ndissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145885/", "sha1": "3f60574221da97619f894c5e52538f9b49873a05", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-046", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:00"}
