ELAHI \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07\u2013615.      Argued January 12, 2009\u2014Decided April 21, 2009\nIn 1997, the International Court of Arbitration awarded petitioner Ira\n  nian Ministry of Defense (hereinafter Iran) $2.8 million to settle a\n  dispute with Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., a California company, over\n  a 1977 contract that would have provided Iran with an air combat\n  training system. When Cubic refused to pay, Iran sued in the Fed\n  eral District Court in San Diego, which ordered Cubic to pay the\n  award plus interest (Cubic Judgment). In 2000, respondent Elahi\n  sued Iran in the D.C. Federal District Court, claiming that Iranian\n  agents had murdered his brother. He obtained a default judgment of\n  about $312 million and sought to collect some of the money by attach\n  ing the Cubic Judgment. Iran opposed the lien under the Foreign\n  Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA). The California District\n  Court denied Iran\u2019s immunity claim, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed,\n  finding an exception to sovereign immunity. This Court vacated and\n  remanded. Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Is\n  lamic Republic of Iran v. Elahi, 546 U. S. 450.\n     On remand, the Ninth Circuit found that a different immunity ex\n  ception applied, citing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002\n  (TRIA), which permitted holders of terrorism-related judgments\n  against Iran to attach \u201cblocked\u201d Iranian assets. The United States\n  had blocked Iranian assets following the Iranian hostage crisis in\n  1979, and the court held that the asset Elahi sought to attach had\n  remained blocked notwithstanding the unblocking orders issued after\n  the crisis was resolved by the Algiers Accords in 1981. The court rea\n  soned that those unblocking orders had omitted military goods such\n  as the training system underlying the Cubic Judgment. The court\n2       MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n        FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    further rejected Iran\u2019s argument that Elahi had waived his right of\n    attachment, and concluded that he could attach the Cubic Judgment.\nHeld:\n    1. The asset in question was not \u201cblocked\u201d at the time of the Ninth\n Circuit\u2019s decision. Contrary to that court\u2019s holding, the relevant asset\n is not Iran\u2019s interest in the air combat training system, but, rather, a\n judgment enforcing an arbitration award based upon Cubic\u2019s failure\n to account to Iran for its share of the proceeds of the system\u2019s even\n tual sale to Canada. And neither the Cubic Judgment nor the sale\n proceeds it represents were blocked assets at the time of the Court of\n Appeals\u2019 2007 decision. In a 1981 order, the Treasury Department\n unblocked transactions involving property in which Iran\u2019s interest\n arose after January 19, 1981. Iran\u2019s interest in the Cubic Judgment\n itself arose on December 7, 1998, when the District Court confirmed\n the arbitration award. And Iran\u2019s interest in the property underlying\n the judgment arose, as the arbitrators ruled, when Cubic completed\n its sale of the air combat system in October 1982. Thus, whether\n Iran\u2019s \u201cinterest in property\u201d is considered to be its interest in the Cu\n bic Judgment itself or its underlying interest in the sale proceeds, the\n interest falls within the terms of the Treasury Department\u2019s general\n unblocking order. Even assuming (as the Ninth Circuit held) that\n the relevant asset was Iran\u2019s pre-1981 interest in the training system\n itself, that asset still was not \u201cblocked\u201d at the time of the decision be\n low. Such an interest would fall directly within the scope of Execu\n tive Order No. 12281, which required that property owned by Iran be\n transferred \u201cas directed . . . by the Government of Iran.\u201d No author\n ity supports the contrary conclusion. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    2. Elahi cannot attach the Cubic Judgment because he has waived\n his right to do so. Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Vio\n lence Protection Act of 2000 (VPA) offers compensation to individuals\n holding terrorism-related judgments against Iran. It requires those\n receiving payment to relinquish \u201call rights to . . . attach property that\n is at issue in claims against the United States before an international\n tribunal.\u201d \u00a72002(a)(2)(D). In 2003, the U. S. Government paid Elahi\n $2.3 million under the VPA as partial compensation for his judgment\n against Iran, and he signed a waiver form that mirrors the statutory\n language. A review of the record in Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal Case\n No. B61 demonstrates that the Cubic Judgment falls within the\n terms of Elahi\u2019s waiver. Iran filed that case in 1982, claiming that\n between 1979 and 1981 the United States had wrongly barred the\n transfer of the Cubic training system and other military equipment\n to Iran. Iran asked the Tribunal to order the United States, among\n other things, to pay Iran damages. The United States answered that\n the Tribunal should set off the $2.8 million represented by the Cubic\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Judgment against any award. Iran argued that the Tribunal should\n  not set off the $2.8 million insofar as third parties have attached the\n  judgment. In the terms of Elahi\u2019s waiver, therefore, the Cubic Judg\n  ment is \u201cproperty,\u201d and Case No. B61 itself is a \u201cclai[m] against the\n  United States before an international tribunal.\u201d And there remains a\n  significant dispute about whether the Cubic Judgment can be used by\n  the Tribunal as a setoff, placing the Judgment \u201cat issue\u201d in Case No.\n  B61. Elahi\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Pp. 12\u201320.\n    3. Given Elahi\u2019s waiver, this Court need not decide whether the\n  Cubic Judgment was blocked by new Executive Branch actions fol\n  lowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision.

Seeking to collect some of the money, he has tried\nto attach an asset belonging to Iran, namely a $2.8 million\njudgment that Iran obtained against a California company\ncalled Cubic Defense Systems, Inc. (Cubic Judgment).\nIran has asserted a defense of sovereign immunity in\norder to prevent the attachment. See Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610.\n   Since Iran is a sovereign nation, Elahi cannot attach the\nCubic Judgment unless he finds an exception to the prin\u00ad\nciple of sovereign immunity that would allow him to do so.\nSee Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of\nIslamic Republic of Iran v. Elahi, 546 U. S. 450 (2006) (per\ncuriam). As the case reaches us, the Terrorism Risk In\u00ad\nsurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), \u00a7201(a), 116 Stat. 2337, note\nfollowing 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610, provides the sole possible\nexception. That Act authorizes holders of terrorism\u00ad\n2     MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nrelated judgments against Iran, such as Elahi, to attach\nIranian assets that the United States has \u201cblocked.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added). And we initially decide whether Iran\u2019s\nCubic Judgment is a \u201cblocked asset\u201d within the terms of\nthat Act.\n   Even if the Cubic Judgment is a blocked asset, however,\nElahi still cannot attach it if he waived his right to do so.\nAnd we next decide whether Elahi waived that right\nwhen, in return for partial compensation from the Gov\u00ad\nernment, he agreed not to attach \u201cproperty that is at issue\nin claims against the United States before an international\ntribunal.\u201d Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection\nAct of 2000 (VPA), \u00a72002(d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA\n\u00a7201(c)(4), 116 Stat. 2339, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610\n(emphasis added).\n   We ultimately hold that the Cubic Judgment was not a\n\u201cblocked asset\u201d at the time the Court of Appeals handed\ndown its decision in this case. We recognize that since\nthat time new Executive Branch action may have\n\u201cblocked\u201d that asset; but, in light of the posture of the case,\nwe do not decide whether it has done so. Rather, we de\u00ad\ntermine that Elahi cannot attach the Cubic Judgment\nregardless, for the Judgment is \u201cat issue\u201d in a claim\nagainst the United States before the Iran-U. S. Claims\nTribunal. The Judgment consequently falls within the\nterms of Elahi\u2019s waiver.\n                              I\n  We initially set forth key background elements, includ\u00ad\ning in this section the events necessary to understand the\n\u201cblocked asset\u201d question, while leaving for Part III, infra,\nadditional background matters related to Elahi\u2019s waiver.\n                         A\n  The Cubic Judgment arose out of a 1977 contract be\u00ad\ntween Cubic Defense Systems, a California company and\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Cubic there promised to supply Iran with certain\nmilitary goods, namely an air combat training system, for\nwhich Iran promised to pay approximately $18 million\ndollars. In 1979, after Iran had paid some of the money\nbut before Cubic had sent the training system, the Iranian\nRevolution broke out, militants in Iran seized American\nhostages, and President Carter \u201cblocked all property and\ninterests in property of the Government of Iran . . . subject\nto the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d Exec.

L. M. 224. Under the\nAccords, the United States agreed to \u201crestore the financial\nposition of Iran, in so far as possible, to that which existed\nprior to November 14, 1979,\u201d ibid., and (with some excep\u00ad\ntions) to \u201carrange, subject to the provisions of U.

The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction included claims by\nnationals of one state against the other state, but it did\nnot include claims by one state against nationals of the\nother state. Id., at 231\u2013232.\n                              B\n   In January 1982, Iran filed two Cubic-based claims in\nthe Tribunal. In Case No. B61, Iran claimed that between\n1979 and 1981 the United States had wrongly barred the\ntransfer of certain military equipment, including the\nCubic air combat training system, to Iran. Iran asked the\nTribunal to order the United States either to issue an\nexport license for the equipment or to pay Iran damages.\nApp. to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22a, 24a,\n31a.\n   In Case No. B66, Iran claimed that Cubic had breached\nits contract to deliver the training system partly because\nthe United States had taken actions contrary to the Al\u00ad\ngiers Accords. Again Iran asked the Tribunal to order\neither the issuance of an export license for the equipment\nor the payment of damages. Id., at 1a, 2a, 9a\u201310a. In\nApril 1987 the Tribunal dismissed this second case (No.\nB66) on the grounds that the Iran-Cubic contract imposed\nno obligations on the United States and that the Tribunal\nlacked jurisdiction to consider a suit by a state (Iran)\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Iran asked that arbitration tribunal to award\nit restitution and damages.\n   In May 1997 the arbitrators issued their decision. The\narbitrators found that prior to the Iranian Revolution,\nprior to the hostage crisis, and prior to the blocking of any\nIranian assets, (1) Iran and Cubic had themselves agreed\nthat they would temporarily discontinue (but not termi\u00ad\nnate) the contract; and (2) Cubic had agreed to try to sell\nthe training system to another buyer and to settle ac\u00ad\ncounts with Iran later. The arbitrators further found that\nafter the crisis (in September 1981) (3) Cubic successfully\nsold a modified version of the system to Canada.

The arbitrators concluded that Cubic\nhad not lived up to this modified agreement. And, after\ntaking account of the advance payments that Iran had\nmade to Cubic, the funds that Cubic had spent, the\namount that Canada had paid Cubic, and various other\nitems, they awarded Iran $2.8 million plus interest. Id.,\n\u00b6C.18.3(a), at G\u201331.\n   Cubic refused to pay Iran this money. Iran then sued in\nthe Federal District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia to enforce the arbitration award.

S., at 452\u2013453.\n   We remanded the case, and on remand, the Ninth Cir\u00ad\ncuit held that the Ministry of Defense fell into the latter\ncategory (an inseparable part of the state of Iran), not the\nformer (an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of Iran). 495 F. 3d\n1024, 1035\u20131036 (2007). Hence Elahi could not take\nadvantage of the \u201cengaged in commercial activities\u201d excep\u00ad\ntion. The Court of Appeals also found inapplicable a\nslightly different exception applicable to \u201cproperty . . . of a\nforeign state . . . used for a commercial activity in the\nUnited States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610(a). 495 F. 3d, at 1036\u2013\n1037.\n   Nonetheless the Court of Appeals found yet another\nexception that it believed denied Iran its sovereign immu\u00ad\nnity defense. The court pointed out that in 2002 Congress\nhad enacted the TRIA. That Act permitted a person with\na terrorism-related judgment to attach an asset of the\nresponsible \u201cterrorist\u201d state to satisfy the judgment,\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d provided\nthat the asset was a \u201cblocked asset.\u201d \u00a7201(a), 116 Stat.\n2337. The Court of Appeals noted that the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment arose out of a pre-1981 contract with Iran involving\n8    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nan air combat training system for Iran, and that President\nCarter had blocked virtually all Iranian assets following\nthe Iranian hostage crisis.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a71701\u20131702 (2000 ed. and Supp.\nV); 31 CFR \u00a7535.201. The Court of Appeals then held that\nthe President had never unblocked the asset in question.\n495 F. 3d, at 1033. In its view, the many unblocking\norders that were issued after the 1981 Algiers Accords,\nsee, e.g., Exec. Orders Nos. 12277\u201312282, 3 CFR 105\u2013113;\n31 CFR \u00a7\u00a7535.211\u2013535.215, 535.579(a), did not apply\nbecause those unblocking orders omitted \u201cmilitary goods\nsuch as the [training system that underlay the Cubic\nJudgment].\u201d 495 F. 3d, at 1033.\n  The Court of Appeals also rejected Iran\u2019s argument that\nElahi had waived his right to attach the Cubic Judgment\nregardless (a matter to which we shall turn in Part III).\nAnd the court concluded that Elahi was free to attach the\nJudgment. Id., at 1037.\n  Iran, with the support of the Department of State, asked\nus to grant certiorari. We did so, and we shall consider\nboth aspects of the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   We turn first to the question whether the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment was a \u201cblocked asset.\u201d The Ninth Circuit held that\nthe asset in question consisted of Iran\u2019s interest in mili\u00ad\ntary goods, namely an air combat training system, which\nit believed the Executive Branch had failed to unblock\nafter the Iranian hostage crisis ended. None of the parties\nhere, however, supports the Ninth Circuit\u2019s determination.\nAnd neither do we.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The basic reason we cannot accept the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nrationale is that we do not believe Cubic\u2019s air combat\ntraining system is the asset here in question. Elahi does\nnot seek to attach that system. Cubic sent the system\nitself to Canada, where, as far as we know, it remains.\nRather, Elahi seeks to attach a judgment enforcing an\narbitration award based upon Cubic\u2019s failure to account to\nIran for Iran\u2019s share of the proceeds of that system\u2019s sale.\nAnd neither the Cubic Judgment nor the sale proceeds\nthat it represents were blocked assets at the time the\nCourt of Appeals issued its decision.\n   In 1981, the Treasury Department issued an order that\nauthorized \u201c[t]ransactions involving property in which\nIran . . . has an interest\u201d where \u201c[t]he interest in the prop\nerty . . . arises after January 19, 1981.\u201d 31 CFR\n\u00a7535.579(a)(1) (emphasis added). As the Court of Appeals\nitself pointed out, Iran\u2019s interest in the Cubic Judgment\narose \u201con December 7, 1998, when the district court con\u00ad\nfirmed the [arbitration] award.\u201d 385 F. 3d, at 1224. Since\nit arose more than 17 years \u201cafter January 19, 1981,\u201d the\nCubic Judgment falls within the terms of Treasury\u2019s\norder. And that fact, in our view, is sufficient to treat the\nJudgment as unblocked.\n   Iran\u2019s interest in the property that underlies the Cubic\nJudgment also arose after January 19, 1981. As the In\u00ad\nternational Court of Arbitration held, Cubic and Iran\nentered into their initial contract before 1981. But they\nlater agreed to discontinue (but not to terminate) the\ncontract. Arbitration Award G\u201315, G\u201321. They agreed\nthat Cubic would try to sell the system elsewhere. Id.,\n\u00b6C.9.15, at G\u201314. And they further agreed that they\nwould take \u201cfinal decisions\u201d about who owed what to\nwhom \u201conly . . . once the result of Cubic\u2019s attempt to resell\nthe System\u201d was \u201cknown.\u201d Id., \u00b6B.10.7, at G\u201317.\n   Cubic completed its sale of the system (to Canada) in\nOctober 1982. Id., \u00b6B.12.14, at G\u201322. And the arbitrators\n10    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nreferred to October 1982 as \u201cthe date the Parties had in\nmind when they agreed to await the outcome of Cubic\u2019s\nresale attempts.\u201d Ibid. Only then was Cubic \u201cin a position\nto reasonably, comprehensively and precisely account for\nthe reuse of components originally manufactured for Iran\nand for any modification costs.\u201d Ibid. For those reasons,\nand in light of the arbitrators\u2019 findings, we must conclude\nthat October 1982 is the time when Iran\u2019s claim to pro\u00ad\nceeds arose.\n   The upshot is that, whether we consider Iran\u2019s \u201cinterest\nin property\u201d as its interest in the Cubic Judgment itself or\nits underlying interest in the proceeds of the Canadian\nsale, the interest falls within the terms of the Treasury\nDepartment\u2019s general license authorizing \u201c[t]ransactions\ninvolving property in which Iran . . . has an interest\u201d\nwhere \u201c[t]he interest in the property . . . arises after Janu\u00ad\nary 19, 1981.\u201d 31 CFR \u00a7535.579(a). And, as we said, that\nfact is sufficient for present purposes to treat the asset as\nhaving been unblocked at the time the Ninth Circuit\nissued the decision below.\n   Finally, even if we were to assume (as the Ninth Circuit\nheld) that the relevant asset were Iran\u2019s pre-1981 interest\nin the air combat training system itself, we should still\nconclude that that asset was not \u201cblocked\u201d at the time of\nthe decision below. As the Government points out, such\nan interest falls directly within the scope of Executive\nOrder No. 12281, an unblocking order that required prop\u00ad\nerty owned by Iran to be transferred \u201cas directed . . . by\nthe Government of Iran.\u201d See also 31 CFR \u00a7535.215(a).\nNone of the four authorities upon which the Ninth Circuit\nrelied indicates the contrary conclusion. First, the Circuit\ncited the Arms Export Control Act, 82 Stat. 1321, 22\nU. S. C. \u00a72751 et seq., and its implementing regulations, a\nstatute and regulations which regulate arms shipments.\nIt is true that, notwithstanding Executive Order No.\n12281, the export of certain military equipment remained\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsubject to regulation under other statutes, including the\nArms Export Control Act. See 31 CFR \u00a7535.215(c). But\nthat fact does not show that military equipment remained\nblocked under IEEPA. The Court of Appeals next cited the\n1979 Executive Order freezing Iranian assets, Exec. Order\nNo. 12170, 3 CFR 457 (Comp. 1980)\u2014but it failed to con\u00ad\nsider the effect of the subsequent unblocking order just\ndiscussed. The Court of Appeals also relied on a 2005\nPresidential notice extending the national emergency with\nrespect to Iran, 70 Fed. Reg. 69039, but that notice did not\nimpose any additional restrictions on Iranian assets.\nFinally, the Court of Appeals pointed to a Treasury De\u00ad\npartment guidance document, which states that \u201c[c]ertain\nassets\u201d\u2014consisting \u201cmainly of military and dual-use prop\u00ad\nerty\u201d\u2014 \u201crelated to . . . claims\u201d by \u201cU. S. nationals . . .\nagainst Iran or Iranian entities\u201d still being litigated in the\nTribunal \u201cremain blocked in the United States.\u201d Office of\nForeign Assets Control, Dept. of Treasury, Foreign Assets\nControl Regulations for Exporters and Importers 23\n(2007). But the training system does not fall into the\ncategory of assets identified by the guidance document.\nThe system neither \u201cremain[s] . . . in the United States\u201d\n(having been sent to Canada), nor was it related to claims\nby \u201cU. S. nationals . . . against Iran or Iranian entities\u201d\nbefore the Tribunal. In sum, no authority supports the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that an Iranian interest in the\ntraining system itself would be a \u201cblocked asset.\u201d And\nnone of the parties defend the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\nhere.\n                           B\n  Although the Cubic Judgment was not a blocked asset\nat the time the Court of Appeals reached its decision, the\nGovernment believes that it is a blocked asset now. In\n2005 the President issued a new Executive Order that\nblocks assets held by proliferators of weapons of mass\n12   MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\ndestruction. Exec. Order No. 13382, 3 CFR 170 (2005\nComp.). And in 2007, after the Court of Appeals issued its\ndecision, the State Department designated certain compo\u00ad\nnent parts of Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense as entities whose\nproperty and interests in property are blocked under\nExecutive Order No. 13382. See 72 Fed. Reg. 71991\u2013\n71992. If the Iranian entity to which the Cubic Judgment\nbelongs falls within the terms of the State Department\u2019s\ndesignation, then presumably that asset is blocked at this\ntime.\n   The problem for the Government, however, is that Iran\ndoes not agree that the relevant parts of its Ministry of\nDefense fall within the scope of the State Department\u2019s\ndesignation. Thus the matter is in dispute. The lower\ncourts have not considered that dispute. The relevant\narguments have not been set forth in detail here. And in\nsuch circumstances we normally would remand the case,\npermitting the lower courts to decide the issue in the first\ninstance. See, e.g., F. Hoffmann\u2013La Roche Ltd v. Empa\ngran S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 175 (2004). Consequently, we\nshall not decide whether the new Executive Branch ac\u00ad\ntions have blocked the Cubic Judgment. Instead, we turn\nto the \u201cwaiver\u201d question. And our answer (that Elahi has\nwaived his right to attach the Cubic Judgment) makes it\nunnecessary to remand the blocking question for further\nconsideration.\n                             III\n  As we have just said, the second question concerns\nElahi\u2019s waiver of his right to attach the Cubic Judgment.\nIn 2000, Congress enacted a statute that offers some\ncompensation to certain individuals, including Elahi, who\nhold terrorism-related judgments against Iran.           VPA\n\u00a72002, as amended by TRIA \u00a7201(c). The Act requires\nthose who receive that compensation to relinquish \u201call\nrights to execute against or attach property that is at issue\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin claims against the United States before an international\ntribunal, [or] that is the subject of awards rendered by\nsuch tribunal.\u201d \u00a72002(a)(2)(D), 114 Stat. 1542; see also\n\u00a72002(d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4) (cross\u00ad\nreferencing \u00a72002(a)(2)(D)). In 2003 the Government paid\nElahi $2.3 million under the Act as partial compensation\nfor his judgment against Iran. Brief for Respondent 9.\nAnd at that time, Elahi signed a waiver form that mirrors\nthe statutory language. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30 (citing 68\nFed. Reg. 8077, 8081 (2003)).\n   The question is whether the Cubic Judgment \u201cis at issue\nin claims\u201d against the United States before an \u201cinterna\u00ad\ntional tribunal,\u201d namely the Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal.\nIf so, the Cubic Judgment falls within the terms of Elahi\u2019s\nwaiver. The Court of Appeals believed the Judgment was\nnot \u201cat issue.\u201d 495 F. 3d, at 1030\u20131031. But we find to the\ncontrary.\n   A review of the record in Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal\nCase No. B61 leads us to conclude that the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment is \u201cat issue\u201d before that Tribunal. In Case No. B61\nIran argued that, between 1979 and 1981, the United\nStates had wrongly prevented the transfer of Cubic\u2019s air\ncombat training system to Iran. Iran asked the Tribunal,\namong other things, to order the United States to pay\ndamages. Statement of Claim, Islamic Republic of Iran v.\nUnited States (filed Jan. 19, 1982), App. to Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 22a, 24a, 31a. In its briefing\nbefore the Tribunal, Iran acknowledged that any amount\nit recovered from Cubic would \u201cbe recuperated from the\nremedy sought\u201d against the United States. App. 76, n. 2.\nAnd Iran sent a letter to the United States in which it said\nthat any amounts it actually received from Cubic would be\n\u201crecouped from the remedy sought against the United\nStates in Case B61.\u201d App. to Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 84a. But Iran added that the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment could not be used as a setoff insofar as it had been\n14   MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nattached by creditors. Id., at 85a.\n   Meanwhile, in a rebuttal brief before the Tribunal, the\nUnited States, while arguing that in fact it owed Iran\nnothing, added that at the very least Iran must set off the\namount \u201calready . . . awarded\u201d by the International Court\nof Arbitration (namely, the $2.8 million awarded to Iran\nfrom Cubic) against any money awarded by the Tribunal.\nId., at 52a, 80a\u201381a, and n. 32. And the United States\u2019\ndemand for a setoff applies even if third parties have\nattached the Cubic Judgment. See Tr. of Tribunal Hear\u00ad\ning, in No. B61 (Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib., Dec. 7 and 12, 2006),\nApp. to Brief for Respondent 37, 38\u201339, 41, 42.\n   The upshot is a dispute about the Cubic Judgment. The\nUnited States argues (and argued before the Tribunal)\nthat the Tribunal should set off the $2.8 million that the\nCubic Judgment represents against any award that the\nTribunal may make against the United States in Case No.\nB61. Iran argues (and argued before the Tribunal) that\nthe Tribunal should not set off the $2.8 million insofar as\nthird parties have attached the Judgment.\n   To put the matter in terms of the language of Elahi\u2019s\nwaiver, one can say for certain that the Cubic Judgment is\n\u201cproperty.\u201d And Case No. B61 itself is a \u201cclai[m] against\nthe United States before an international tribunal.\u201d We\ncan also be reasonably certain that how the Tribunal\nshould use that property is also under dispute or in ques\u00ad\ntion in that claim. Moreover, since several parties other\nthan Elahi have already attached the Cubic Judgment, see\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20, the question\nwhether an attached claim can be used as a setoff is po\u00ad\ntentially significant, irrespective of Elahi\u2019s own efforts to\nattach the judgment.\n   Are these circumstances sufficient to place the Cubic\nJudgment \u201cat issue\u201d in Case No. B61? Elahi argues not.\nHe points out that the Cubic Judgment does not appear on\na list of property contained in Iran\u2019s statement of claim in\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCase No. B61; nor is it the subject of any other claim\nbefore the Tribunal. Indeed, Iran and the United States\ndo not dispute the Cubic Judgment\u2019s validity; they do not\ndispute the Cubic Judgment\u2019s ownership; and they do not\ndispute the fact that the United States\u2019 asset freeze had no\nadverse effect on the Cubic Judgment or on Iran\u2019s entitle\u00ad\nment to the Cubic Judgment. As the dissent correctly\npoints out, the Judgment is not \u201cat issue\u201d in any of these\nsenses. The Judgment will neither be suspended nor\nmodified by the Tribunal in Case No. B61, nor is the\nJudgment property claimed by Iran from the United\nStates in that case, see post, at 2\u20135.\n  But that does not end the matter. The question is\nwhether, for purposes of the VPA, a judgment can never\u00ad\ntheless be \u201cat issue\u201d before the Tribunal even when it will\nnot be suspended or modified by the Tribunal and when it\nis not claimed by Iran from the United States. Here, a\nsignificant dispute about the Cubic Judgment still re\u00ad\nmains, namely a dispute about whether it can be used by\nthe Tribunal as a setoff. And in our view, that dispute is\nsufficient to put the Judgment \u201cat issue\u201d in the case.\n  For one thing, we do not doubt that the setoff matter is\n\u201cunder dispute\u201d or \u201cin question\u201d in Case No. B61, and\nthose words typically define the term \u201cat issue.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 136 (8th ed. 2004). In the event that the\nTribunal finds the United States liable in Case No. B61,\nthe total sum awarded to Iran by the Tribunal will depend\non whether the Judgment is used as a setoff. And whether\nthe Judgment can be so used depends, in turn, on whether\nthe United States is right that an attached judgment\nshould be set off or whether Iran is right that it should not\nbe\u2014a matter in question before the Tribunal. In that\nsense, the Judgment is \u201cunder dispute.\u201d We recognize\nthat the dispute is over the use of the Judgment, not the\nvalidity of the Judgment. But we do not see how that fact\nmatters.\n16    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n  For another thing, ordinary legal disputes can easily\nencompass questions of setoff. Suppose Smith sues a\ncarrier for wrongfully harming a shipment of goods. The\nquestion of liability, the question of damages, and the\nquestion of reducing damages through setoff may all be at\nissue in the case. Which is the more important issue in a\nparticular case depends not upon the category (liability,\ndamages, or setoff) but upon the circumstances of that\nparticular case.\n  Further, the language of the statute suggests that Con\u00ad\ngress meant the words \u201cat issue\u201d to carry the ordinary\nmeaning just described. Elahi essentially distinguishes\nbetween property that is the subject of a claim (a claim, for\nexample, that the United States took or harmed particular\nproperty belonging to Iran) and property that might oth\u00ad\nerwise affect a Tribunal judgment (say, through its use as\na setoff). And he argues that the statutory phrase \u201cat\nissue\u201d covers only the first kind of dispute, not the second.\nBut the statute does not limit the property that is \u201cat issue\nin a claim\u201d to property that is the subject of a claim. To\nthe contrary, the statute says that judgment creditors\nsuch as Elahi must\n     \u201crelinquis[h] all rights to execute against or attach\n     property [1] that is at issue in claims against the\n     United States before an international tribunal [or] [2]\n     that is the subject of awards rendered by such tribu\u00ad\n     nal.\u201d VPA \u00a72002(a)(2)(D), 114 Stat. 1542 (emphasis\n     added); see also \u00a72002(d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA\n     \u00a7201(c)(4) (cross-referencing \u00a72002(a)(2)(D)).\nHad Congress wanted to limit the property to which it\nfirst refers (namely, property that is \u201cat issue\u201d in a claim)\nto property that is the subject of a claim, it seems likely\nthat Congress straightforwardly would have used the\nwords \u201csubject of\u201d\u2014words that appear later (in respect to\nawards rendered) in the very same sentence.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, the statute\u2019s purpose leans in the direction of a\nbroader interpretation of the words \u201cat issue\u201d than that\nproposed by Elahi. Pointing to the statute\u2019s legislative\nhistory, Elahi says that the statute seeks to enable victims\nof terrorism to collect on judgments they have won against\nterrorist parties. See Brief of Respondent 6\u20137, 31 (citing\nH. R. Conf. Rep. No. 107\u2013779 (2002); 148 Cong. Rec.\n23119, 23121\u201323123 (2002) (statement of Sen. Harkin)).\nHe is such a victim, and, he says, Congress would have\nintended an interpretation that favors his cause. But\nCongress had a more complicated set of purposes in mind.\nThe statute authorizes the attachment of blocked assets,\nand it provides partial compensation to victims to be paid\n(in part) from general Treasury funds. But it does so in\nexchange for a right of subrogation, VPA \u00a72002(c), and for\nthe victim\u2019s promise not to pursue the balance of the\njudgment by attaching property \u201cat issue\u201d in a claim\nagainst the United States before the Tribunal. VPA\n\u00a7\u00a72002(a)(2)(D), (d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4).\nThe statute thereby protects property that the United\nStates might use to satisfy its potential liability to Iran.\n   The Cubic Judgment falls into this category. It is prop\u00ad\nerty that the United States could use to satisfy its poten\u00ad\ntial liability to Iran, but which may be unavailable for that\npurpose if successfully attached. With respect to the\nstatute\u2019s revenue-saving purpose, it is difficult to distin\u00ad\nguish between property that is the subject of a claim\nbefore a tribunal and property that is in dispute before the\ntribunal in respect to its use as an offset.\n   The dissent adds that the \u201cbetter reading\u201d of the words\n\u201cat issue\u201d is one that limits them to the \u201cfoster[ing] [of]\ncompliance with the Government\u2019s international obliga\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Post, at 6. We agree with this statement, but we\ndo not see how it adds anything but new phraseology to\nthe dissent\u2019s basic claim, namely that arguments before\nthe Tribunal about \u201csetoffs\u201d do not count as \u201cissues.\u201d To\n18   MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nrepeat our own view of the matter, a dispute about\nwhether one country must pay the other country more\nmoney because it cannot use particular property (because\nof an attachment) to satisfy an obligation raises an issue\nthat the Tribunal must resolve, no less and no more than\nother issues that might be before the Tribunal in that case\nor other cases.\n   Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, post, at 8, there is\nno unfairness in our holding. Elahi could have chosen to\nforgo the Government\u2019s compensation scheme, and he then\ncould have attached the Cubic Judgment, as have other\nterrorist victims with judgments against Iran. See Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 20. But that course\ncarried risks: Iran had challenged Elahi\u2019s notice of lien\nand it was uncertain whether Elahi would prevail. In\n2003, while litigation over his notice of lien was pending,\nElahi chose to participate in the Government\u2019s scheme.\nHe thereby received the benefit of immediate, guaranteed\npartial compensation from the Government\u2014in exchange\nfor a promise not to interfere with property that the\nUnited States might need to satisfy potential liability to\nIran. Having received $2.3 million in Government funds,\nthere is nothing unfair about holding Elahi to the terms of\nhis bargain.\n   Elahi makes several other arguments. He points to\nlanguage in the TRIA (the statute authorizing attachment\nof blocked assets) which says: \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other\nprovision of law\u201d the \u201cblocked assets\u201d of a state \u201cshall be\nsubject to . . . attachment in aid of execution\u201d of a terror\u00ad\nism-related judgment. \u00a7201(a), 116 Stat. 2337 (emphasis\nadded). He also points to VPA \u00a72002(d)(4), as added by\nTRIA \u00a7201(c)(4), 116 Stat. 2339, which reads: \u201c[N]othing\nin this subsection [which contains the relinquishment\nprovision] shall bar . . . enforcement of any\u201d terrorism\u00ad\nrelated \u201cjudgment . . . against assets otherwise available\nunder this section or under any other provision of law\u201d\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(emphasis added). The first provision, Elahi argues, per\u00ad\nmits him to attach blocked assets notwithstanding the\nVPA\u2019s requirement that he relinquish his right to attach\nproperty \u201cat issue\u201d before an international tribunal; and\nthat conclusion, he says, is reinforced by VPA \u00a72002(d)(4).\nOur interpretation, he adds, would \u201cbar . . . enforcement\u201d\nof a terrorism-related judgment \u201cotherwise available\u201d\nunder TRIA \u00a7201(a)\u2014contrary to the statutory language\njust quoted.\n   But VPA \u00a72002(d)(5) requires Elahi, in exchange for\nhaving received partial compensation, to relinquish \u201call\nrights\u201d to attach property \u201cat issue\u201d in an international\ntribunal. VPA \u00a72002(a)(2)(D), 114 Stat. 1542 (cross\u00ad\nreferenced by \u00a72002(d)(5)(B); emphasis added). And, as\nseveral courts of appeals have apparently assumed, the\nrelinquishment of \u201call rights\u201d includes the right given by\nTRIA \u00a7201(a) to attach blocked assets. See Hegna v.\nIslamic Republic of Iran, 376 F. 3d 226, 232 (CA4 2004);\nHegna v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 380 F. 3d 1000, 1009\n(CA7 2004); Hegna v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 402 F. 3d\n97, 99 (CA2 2005) (per curiam).\n   Moreover, the relinquishment provision that applies to\nElahi was added to the VPA by the very same statute, the\nTRIA, that permitted the attachment of blocked assets,\nand which contains the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause upon\nwhich Elahi relies. \u00a7201(a) (blocked assets); \u00a7201(c)\n(amending VPA). Congress could not have intended the\nwords to which Elahi refers to narrow so dramatically an\nimportant provision that it inserted in the same statute.\nAnd for those who, like Elahi, argue that the legislative\nhistory supports his reading of the statute, we point out\nthat the history suggests that Congress placed the \u201cnot\u00ad\nwithstanding\u201d clause in \u00a7201(a) for totally different rea\u00ad\nsons, namely to eliminate the effect of any Presidential\nwaiver issued under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610(f) prior to the date\nof the TRIA\u2019s enactment. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 107\u2013779, at\n20    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n27.\n   Elahi makes three final arguments, first that setoff is\nnot \u201cat issue\u201d because the United States has argued in\nCase No. B61 that it has no liability at all, second that set\u00ad\noff is not \u201cat issue\u201d because the United States has not\nformally asserted a setoff before the Tribunal, and third\nthat the Government violated his due process rights by\ninadequately informing that his waiver would deprive him\nof his right to attach the Cubic Judgment. We find none of\nthese arguments convincing and shall briefly indicate our\nreasons in summary form.\n   As to the first, the United States argued setoff in the\nalternative, thereby placing it, in the alternative, \u201cat\nissue\u201d before the Tribunal. As to the second, Elahi at most\npoints to a ground for disputing the propriety, under\nTribunal rules, for granting a setoff; he does not deny that\nthe Tribunal sometimes can do so, see, e.g., Futura Trad\ning Inc. v. National Iranian Oil Co., 13 Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib.\nRep. 99, 115\u2013116, \u00b662 (1986) (preventing collection on a\nclaim because the claimant had already collected the sum\nat issue from a different party). Hence whether the Tri\u00ad\nbunal can provide for a setoff here is a matter for the\nTribunal to decide, and until it does decide, one way or the\nother, the matter is \u201cat issue.\u201d As to the third, we can find\nnothing that shows Elahi was unfairly surprised by the\nscope of his waiver\u2014certainly not to the point of violating\nany Due Process rights. See, e.g., 14 Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib.\nRep., at 278, \u00b610 (dismissal of Iran\u2019s claim against Cubic\nwas \u201cwithout prejudice to any findings it may make con\u00ad\ncerning [the Cubic contract] in Case No. B61\u201d).\n                           IV\n  We conclude: The Cubic Judgment was not blocked at\nthe time the Court of Appeals reached its decision. We do\nnot decide whether more recent Executive Branch actions\nwould block the Judgment at present. Regardless, Elahi\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

As to Parts I and\nII, the Court is correct, in my view, to hold that the Cubic\nJudgment was not a \u201cblocked asset\u201d when the Court of\nAppeals reached its decision. As to Parts III and IV,\nhowever, respondent Dariush Elahi has not relinquished\nhis right to attach the Cubic Judgment. By holding oth\u00ad\nerwise, the Court departs from the plain meaning and the\npurpose of the statutes Congress enacted to compensate\nElahi and other victims of terrorism.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   The statutory phrase to be interpreted is \u201cproperty that\nis at issue in claims against the United States before an\ninternational tribunal.\u201d Victims of Trafficking and Vio\u00ad\nlence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA), \u00a72002(d)(s), as\nadded by Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA),\n\u00a7201(c)(4), 116 Stat. 2339, note following 28 U.

The context, of course, is Case No. B61\u2014a suit by\nIran against the United States that is pending before the\n2    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                  Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nIran-U. S. Claims Tribunal. The word \u201cproperty,\u201d as used\nin the statutory phrase, surely can refer both to tangible\nproperty, such as real estate or valuables in a safe-deposit\nbox, and to intangible property interests, such as a claim,\na cause of action or, as in this case, a judgment rendered\nby a United States district court. Still, it must be ac\u00ad\nknowledged that the term \u201cat issue\u201d is neither precise nor\nmuch illuminated by its operation in cases or other stat\u00ad\nutes. The absence of any clear authority on this point\nmakes it imperative to adopt an interpretation that ac\u00ad\ncords with familiar and well-settled principles of law. In\nthis case those principles are the rules designed to give\nfull and proper respect to final judgments rendered by\ncourts of competent jurisdiction.\n   To determine whether the Cubic Judgment is \u201cat issue\u201d\nin Case No. B61, the primary consideration must be\nwhether the Claims Tribunal, in the exercise of its own\nauthority and jurisdiction, can affect the ownership, dispo\u00ad\nsition, or control of the property the judgment comprises.\nHere the property in question is a judgment rendered by\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District\nof California. As all acknowledge, that court had jurisdic\u00ad\ntion over the subject and the persons then before it. And,\nas is further conceded, that court\u2019s judgment is valid and\nhas binding force on Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., the non\u00ad\ngovernmental party before that court. See Ministry of\nDefense and Support for Armed Forces of Islamic Republic\nof Iran v. Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., 29 F. Supp. 2d\n1168, 1170 (1998). Neither party to Case No. B61 ques\u00ad\ntions the judgment or requests the Claims Tribunal to\ninterpret it\u2014much less to alter, enforce or invalidate it.\n   Even if one of the parties were to ask the Claims Tribu\u00ad\nnal to modify the Cubic Judgment, the Tribunal would\nsimply lack power to do so. The judgment arises out of\nIran\u2019s contractual dispute with Cubic, an American com\u00ad\npany, and the Tribunal has no \u201cjurisdiction over claims by\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

In these circumstances the Cubic Judgment\nis simply an extrinsic fact beyond the Claims Tribunal\u2019s\npower to affect. True, the Tribunal, when it enters its own\norders, might or might not give credit to the United States\nfor a payment, or a right to payment, arising out of the\nCubic Judgment; but that does not put the judgment itself\nat issue.\n                            B\n   Even if the Court\u2019s broad reading of the phrase \u201cat\nissue\u201d were correct, the Court\u2019s conclusion would still be\nwrong because the relinquishment provision is limited to\nproperty that is at issue \u201cin claims against the United\nStates.\u201d And the Cubic Judgment is not part of the claims\nIran makes in Case No. B61, as both Iran and the United\nStates have made clear in their submissions to the Claims\nTribunal. To put the countries\u2019 filings in context, a brief\nreview of both the Cubic Judgment and Case No. B61 is\nnecessary.\n   The Cubic Judgment is the result of a contract dispute\nbetween Iran and Cubic. In the late 1970\u2019s, Iran hired\nCubic to build an air combat training system, and ad\u00ad\nvanced some $12 million for the project. But Iran failed to\nmake all the payments due. App. 43\u201344. Thus rebuffed,\nCubic sold the system to Canada and refused to refund\nany of Iran\u2019s advance payments. Iran brought an arbitra\u00ad\ntion against Cubic. The panel of arbitrators, after ascer\u00ad\ntaining Cubic\u2019s costs of building the system, and after\nallowing the company a reasonable profit of $3.5 million,\nordered Cubic to return to Iran $2.8 million of the $12\nmillion advance. Iran brought this arbitration award to\n4     MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v.

The\njudgment orders Cubic to pay Iran $2.8 million. Cubic\nDefense Systems, supra, at 1171, 1174.\n   Case No. B61 is in essence a contract dispute between\nIran and the United States. Iran accuses the United\nStates of breaking its promise, made in the Algiers Ac\u00ad\ncords, to \u201carrange . . . for the transfer to Iran of all Iranian\nproperties\u201d located in the United States on January 19,\n1981. 20 I. L. M. 224, 227, \u00b69 (1981). One of the proper\u00ad\nties Iran claims is Cubic\u2019s air combat training system. See\nStatement of Claim in No. B61, (Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib.), App.\nto Brief for United States 22a, 24a, 31a. Both parties have\nconfirmed, in their joint report describing all the \u201cproperty\nclaimed by Iran,\u201d that Cubic\u2019s system is \u201cat issue\u201d in Iran\u2019s\nclaims. Cover Letter to Final Joint Report (July 14, 1989),\nApp. to Brief for Respondent 14.\n   But the Cubic Judgment, in contrast to Cubic\u2019s training\nsystem, is not part of Iran\u2019s claims in Case No. B61. Both\ncountries made this clear in their submissions to the Tri\u00ad\nbunal. Their joint report does not list the Cubic Judgment\namong the properties \u201cat issue.\u201d Final Joint Report (July\n14, 1989), App. to Brief for Respondent 15\u201323. And, in a\nstatement altogether consistent with that omission, Iran\ntold the Tribunal that \u201c [t]he subject matter of [Case No.\nB61], at variance with the [arbitration] action [against\nCubic], is the losses suffered by Iran as a result of the\nUnited States\u2019 non-export of Iranian properties. \u201d Iran\u2019s\nStatement 16, App. 73, 76.

TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4), 116\nStat. 2339 (amending VTVPA \u00a72002(d)).\n                                II\n   Even if the text of the relinquishment provision were\nsomehow ambiguous\u2014and it is not\u2014then the purpose of\nthe VTVPA and TRIA would tip the scales in Elahi\u2019s favor.\nThe text and the evident purpose of those statutes demon\u00ad\nstrate that Congress\u2019 primary purpose was to compensate\nthe victims of terrorism, not to secure from those victims a\nrelinquishment of their claims to property owned by enti\u00ad\nties found to have sponsored terrorism.\n   The text of the VTVPA, and of the amendments made to\nit by the TRIA, shows that Congress\u2019 primary purpose was\nto enable the victims of terrorism to execute on the assets\nof a state found to have sponsored or assisted in a terrorist\nact. In the first subsection of the TRIA concerning the\nattachment of state assets by victims of terrorism, Con\u00ad\ngress provided that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision\nof law . . . in every case in which a person has obtained a\njudgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon\nan act of terrorism . . . the blocked assets of that terrorist\nparty . . . shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid\nof execution in order to satisfy such judgment . . . .\u201d TRIA\n\u00a7201(a), id., at 2337. The effect of this subsection is to\nensure that other laws do not bar victims\u2019 efforts to en\u00ad\nforce judgments against terrorist states. To like effect is\n6     MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nanother paragraph of the VTVPA concerning victims of\nIranian terrorism. Entitled \u201cStatutory Construction,\u201d this\nparagraph reads: \u201cNothing in this subsection shall bar, or\nrequire delay in, enforcement of any judgment to which\nthis subsection applies under any procedure . . . .\u201d\n\u00a72002(d)(4), as added by TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4), id., at 2339.\nThough neither provision refers in direct terms to the\nrelinquishment provision, both provisions show Congress\u2019\nintent to broaden, rather than limit, the rights of victims\nlike Elahi to execute on property owned by state sponsors\nof terrorism. Yet the opinion issued by the Court today\ndoes just the opposite.\n   To contravene the statute\u2019s clear design, the Court\nsurmises that Congress also had a \u201cmore complicated\u201d\npurpose, namely, to \u201cprotec[t] property that the United\nStates might use to satisfy its potential liability to Iran.\u201d\nAnte, at 17. This imagined purpose, the Court says, re\u00ad\nquires us to read the relinquishment provision as broadly\nas possible so as to prevent victims of terrorism from\nattaching property. But the Court does not point to evi\u00ad\ndence of this putative purpose, aside from the text of the\nrelinquishment provision itself\u2014a text which, as submit\u00ad\nted above, the Court reads the wrong way.\n   The better reading of the relinquishment provision\u2014and\none much more consistent with Congress\u2019 protective pur\u00ad\npose\u2014is not as a \u201crevenue-saving\u201d device, ibid., but as a\nway to foster compliance with the Government\u2019s interna\u00ad\ntional obligations. If Iran has asked the Claims Tribunal\nto resolve the status of certain property, then Iran and the\nTribunal may well take the position that the United\nStates has a responsibility under the Algiers Accords to\nprevent U. S. nationals from executing against that prop\u00ad\nerty. That concern is not present in this case. The owner\u00ad\nship of the Cubic Judgment is not disputed, and allowing\nElahi to attach it will not affect Iran\u2019s right to obtain full\nrecovery from the United States in Case No. B61. At\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Ante, at 17. But that agreement is\nhard to square with the Court\u2019s insistence upon fulfilling\nwhat it sees as the statute\u2019s \u201crevenue-saving purpose.\u201d\nIbid. If the Court did in fact believe that the \u201c\u2018better\nreading\u2019\u201d of the statute\u2019s purpose, ibid., is to foster compli\u00ad\nance with the United States\u2019 international obligations,\nthen the Court would affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals. Elahi\u2019s attachment of the Cubic Judgment does\nnot hinder the U. S. Government\u2019s efforts to comply with\nits obligations under the Algiers Accords. At Algiers, the\nUnited States agreed to \u201carrange . . . for the transfer to\nIran of all Iranian properties\u201d located in the United\nStates. 20 I. L. M., at 227, \u00b69. That is not an obligation to\npay Iran money, as the Court seems to believe. See ante,\nat 17. It is instead an obligation to take specific action in\nregard to specific properties. These specific properties do\nnot include the Cubic Judgment\u2014as the Court concedes.\nSee ante, at 9 (holding that the Cubic Judgment was not\nblocked). Therefore, Elahi\u2019s attachment of the Cubic\nJudgment does not impede the United States\u2019 efforts to\nmake good on its obligations under the Algiers Accords.\n   To be sure, a judicial lien on one of the specific proper\u00ad\nties referenced by the Algiers Accords might make it diffi\u00ad\ncult for the U. S. Government to comply with its obliga\u00ad\ntions, under those Accords, to arrange for that property\u2019s\ntransfer to Iran. By encouraging creditors such as Elahi\nto give up their liens on these specific properties that are\nsubject to the Algiers Accords, the TRIA makes it easier\nfor the Government to comply with its obligation to \u201car\u00ad\nrange . . . for the transfer\u201d of these properties to Iran.\nThis purpose (fostering compliance with the United States\u2019\nobligation under the Algiers Accords) is more in keeping\nwith the statute\u2019s text than is the Court\u2019s \u201crevenue-saving\u201d\n8    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v.

The Court today puts an end to Elahi\u2019s\ndecade-long quest to hold Iran to account for murdering\nhis brother Cyrus. In 2000, Elahi won a wrongful-death\nlawsuit against Iran and was awarded some $6 million in\ncompensatory damages. See Elahi v. Islamic Republic of\nIran, 124 F. Supp. 2d 97 (DC). In April 2003, Elahi took\nwhat he must have considered a further step toward his\ngoal when he accepted $2.3 million from the U. S. Gov\u00ad\nernment under the VTVPA.\n  After today\u2019s ruling, what once appeared Elahi\u2019s gain of\n$2.3 million now seems to be a loss of $500,000. By taking\nthe VTVPA\u2019s $2.3 million, the Court holds, Elahi relin\u00ad\nquished his right to the $2.8 million Cubic Judgment he\nhad already attached. The practical effect of the Court\u2019s\nruling is to turn the purpose of the VTVPA on its head.\nRather than further Elahi\u2019s effort to obtain compensation\nfor the murder of his brother, the Act has instead set him\nback half a million dollars. For the reasons given above,\nthis result was not what Congress intended when it\npassed the VTVPA.\n                           IV\n  Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence\nProtection Act and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to\ncompensate victims of terrorism. Congress expressed this\npurpose both in the text of the principal provision inter\u00ad\npreted here and in accompanying sections of the statute.\n                Cite as: 556 U.

Argued January 12, 2009\u2014Decided April 21, 2009\nIn 1997, the International Court of Arbitration awarded petitioner Ira\n  nian Ministry of Defense (hereinafter Iran) $2.8 million to settle a\n  dispute with Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., a California company, over\n  a 1977 contract that would have provided Iran with an air combat\n  training system. When Cubic refused to pay, Iran sued in the Fed\n  eral District Court in San Diego, which ordered Cubic to pay the\n  award plus interest (Cubic Judgment). In 2000, respondent Elahi\n  sued Iran in the D.C. Federal District Court, claiming that Iranian\n  agents had murdered his brother. He obtained a default judgment of\n  about $312 million and sought to collect some of the money by attach\n  ing the Cubic Judgment. Iran opposed the lien under the Foreign\n  Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA). The California District\n  Court denied Iran\u2019s immunity claim, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed,\n  finding an exception to sovereign immunity. This Court vacated and\n  remanded. Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of Is\n  lamic Republic of Iran v. Elahi, 546 U. S. 450.\n     On remand, the Ninth Circuit found that a different immunity ex\n  ception applied, citing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002\n  (TRIA), which permitted holders of terrorism-related judgments\n  against Iran to attach \u201cblocked\u201d Iranian assets. The United States\n  had blocked Iranian assets following the Iranian hostage crisis in\n  1979, and the court held that the asset Elahi sought to attach had\n  remained blocked notwithstanding the unblocking orders issued after\n  the crisis was resolved by the Algiers Accords in 1981. The court rea\n  soned that those unblocking orders had omitted military goods such\n  as the training system underlying the Cubic Judgment. The court\n2       MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n        FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    further rejected Iran\u2019s argument that Elahi had waived his right of\n    attachment, and concluded that he could attach the Cubic Judgment.\nHeld:\n    1. The asset in question was not \u201cblocked\u201d at the time of the Ninth\n Circuit\u2019s decision. Contrary to that court\u2019s holding, the relevant asset\n is not Iran\u2019s interest in the air combat training system, but, rather, a\n judgment enforcing an arbitration award based upon Cubic\u2019s failure\n to account to Iran for its share of the proceeds of the system\u2019s even\n tual sale to Canada. And neither the Cubic Judgment nor the sale\n proceeds it represents were blocked assets at the time of the Court of\n Appeals\u2019 2007 decision. In a 1981 order, the Treasury Department\n unblocked transactions involving property in which Iran\u2019s interest\n arose after January 19, 1981. Iran\u2019s interest in the Cubic Judgment\n itself arose on December 7, 1998, when the District Court confirmed\n the arbitration award. And Iran\u2019s interest in the property underlying\n the judgment arose, as the arbitrators ruled, when Cubic completed\n its sale of the air combat system in October 1982. Thus, whether\n Iran\u2019s \u201cinterest in property\u201d is considered to be its interest in the Cu\n bic Judgment itself or its underlying interest in the sale proceeds, the\n interest falls within the terms of the Treasury Department\u2019s general\n unblocking order. Even assuming (as the Ninth Circuit held) that\n the relevant asset was Iran\u2019s pre-1981 interest in the training system\n itself, that asset still was not \u201cblocked\u201d at the time of the decision be\n low. Such an interest would fall directly within the scope of Execu\n tive Order No. 12281, which required that property owned by Iran be\n transferred \u201cas directed . . . by the Government of Iran.\u201d No author\n ity supports the contrary conclusion. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    2. Elahi cannot attach the Cubic Judgment because he has waived\n his right to do so. Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Vio\n lence Protection Act of 2000 (VPA) offers compensation to individuals\n holding terrorism-related judgments against Iran. It requires those\n receiving payment to relinquish \u201call rights to . . . attach property that\n is at issue in claims against the United States before an international\n tribunal.\u201d \u00a72002(a)(2)(D). In 2003, the U. S. Government paid Elahi\n $2.3 million under the VPA as partial compensation for his judgment\n against Iran, and he signed a waiver form that mirrors the statutory\n language. A review of the record in Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal Case\n No. B61 demonstrates that the Cubic Judgment falls within the\n terms of Elahi\u2019s waiver. Iran filed that case in 1982, claiming that\n between 1979 and 1981 the United States had wrongly barred the\n transfer of the Cubic training system and other military equipment\n to Iran. Iran asked the Tribunal to order the United States, among\n other things, to pay Iran damages. The United States answered that\n the Tribunal should set off the $2.8 million represented by the Cubic\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Judgment against any award. Iran argued that the Tribunal should\n  not set off the $2.8 million insofar as third parties have attached the\n  judgment. In the terms of Elahi\u2019s waiver, therefore, the Cubic Judg\n  ment is \u201cproperty,\u201d and Case No. B61 itself is a \u201cclai[m] against the\n  United States before an international tribunal.\u201d And there remains a\n  significant dispute about whether the Cubic Judgment can be used by\n  the Tribunal as a setoff, placing the Judgment \u201cat issue\u201d in Case No.\n  B61. Elahi\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Pp. 12\u201320.\n    3. Given Elahi\u2019s waiver, this Court need not decide whether the\n  Cubic Judgment was blocked by new Executive Branch actions fol\n  lowing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision.

Seeking to collect some of the money, he has tried\nto attach an asset belonging to Iran, namely a $2.8 million\njudgment that Iran obtained against a California company\ncalled Cubic Defense Systems, Inc. (Cubic Judgment).\nIran has asserted a defense of sovereign immunity in\norder to prevent the attachment. See Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610.\n   Since Iran is a sovereign nation, Elahi cannot attach the\nCubic Judgment unless he finds an exception to the prin\u00ad\nciple of sovereign immunity that would allow him to do so.\nSee Ministry of Defense and Support for Armed Forces of\nIslamic Republic of Iran v. Elahi, 546 U. S. 450 (2006) (per\ncuriam). As the case reaches us, the Terrorism Risk In\u00ad\nsurance Act of 2002 (TRIA), \u00a7201(a), 116 Stat. 2337, note\nfollowing 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610, provides the sole possible\nexception. That Act authorizes holders of terrorism\u00ad\n2     MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v.

And we initially decide whether Iran\u2019s\nCubic Judgment is a \u201cblocked asset\u201d within the terms of\nthat Act.\n   Even if the Cubic Judgment is a blocked asset, however,\nElahi still cannot attach it if he waived his right to do so.\nAnd we next decide whether Elahi waived that right\nwhen, in return for partial compensation from the Gov\u00ad\nernment, he agreed not to attach \u201cproperty that is at issue\nin claims against the United States before an international\ntribunal.\u201d Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection\nAct of 2000 (VPA), \u00a72002(d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA\n\u00a7201(c)(4), 116 Stat. 2339, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610\n(emphasis added).\n   We ultimately hold that the Cubic Judgment was not a\n\u201cblocked asset\u201d at the time the Court of Appeals handed\ndown its decision in this case. We recognize that since\nthat time new Executive Branch action may have\n\u201cblocked\u201d that asset; but, in light of the posture of the case,\nwe do not decide whether it has done so. Rather, we de\u00ad\ntermine that Elahi cannot attach the Cubic Judgment\nregardless, for the Judgment is \u201cat issue\u201d in a claim\nagainst the United States before the Iran-U. S. Claims\nTribunal. The Judgment consequently falls within the\nterms of Elahi\u2019s waiver.\n                              I\n  We initially set forth key background elements, includ\u00ad\ning in this section the events necessary to understand the\n\u201cblocked asset\u201d question, while leaving for Part III, infra,\nadditional background matters related to Elahi\u2019s waiver.\n                         A\n  The Cubic Judgment arose out of a 1977 contract be\u00ad\ntween Cubic Defense Systems, a California company and\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

In Case No. B61, Iran claimed that between\n1979 and 1981 the United States had wrongly barred the\ntransfer of certain military equipment, including the\nCubic air combat training system, to Iran.

The Court of Appeals thought that the Minis\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

S. C.\n\u00a71610(b). See 385 F. 3d, at 1219\u20131222. But, on review\nhere, we pointed out (in a per curiam opinion) that the\nsovereign immunity exception upon which the Ninth\nCircuit had relied\u2014the exception for the property of an\nentity that has \u201cengaged in commercial activity,\u201d\n\u00a71610(b)(2)\u2014applies only to property of an \u201cagency or\ninstrumentality\u201d of a foreign state. It does not apply to\nproperty of an entity that itself is an inseparable part of\nthe foreign state. \u00a71610(a). Elahi, 546 U. S., at 452\u2013453.\n   We remanded the case, and on remand, the Ninth Cir\u00ad\ncuit held that the Ministry of Defense fell into the latter\ncategory (an inseparable part of the state of Iran), not the\nformer (an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of Iran). 495 F. 3d\n1024, 1035\u20131036 (2007). Hence Elahi could not take\nadvantage of the \u201cengaged in commercial activities\u201d excep\u00ad\ntion. The Court of Appeals also found inapplicable a\nslightly different exception applicable to \u201cproperty . . . of a\nforeign state . . . used for a commercial activity in the\nUnited States,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610(a). 495 F. 3d, at 1036\u2013\n1037.\n   Nonetheless the Court of Appeals found yet another\nexception that it believed denied Iran its sovereign immu\u00ad\nnity defense. The court pointed out that in 2002 Congress\nhad enacted the TRIA. That Act permitted a person with\na terrorism-related judgment to attach an asset of the\nresponsible \u201cterrorist\u201d state to satisfy the judgment,\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,\u201d provided\nthat the asset was a \u201cblocked asset.\u201d \u00a7201(a), 116 Stat.\n2337. The Court of Appeals noted that the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment arose out of a pre-1981 contract with Iran involving\n8    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nan air combat training system for Iran, and that President\nCarter had blocked virtually all Iranian assets following\nthe Iranian hostage crisis. See Exec. Order No. 12170, 44\nFed.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a71701\u20131702 (2000 ed. and Supp.\nV); 31 CFR \u00a7535.201. The Court of Appeals then held that\nthe President had never unblocked the asset in question.\n495 F. 3d, at 1033. In its view, the many unblocking\norders that were issued after the 1981 Algiers Accords,\nsee, e.g., Exec. Orders Nos. 12277\u201312282, 3 CFR 105\u2013113;\n31 CFR \u00a7\u00a7535.211\u2013535.215, 535.579(a), did not apply\nbecause those unblocking orders omitted \u201cmilitary goods\nsuch as the [training system that underlay the Cubic\nJudgment].\u201d 495 F. 3d, at 1033.\n  The Court of Appeals also rejected Iran\u2019s argument that\nElahi had waived his right to attach the Cubic Judgment\nregardless (a matter to which we shall turn in Part III).\nAnd the court concluded that Elahi was free to attach the\nJudgment. Id., at 1037.\n  Iran, with the support of the Department of State, asked\nus to grant certiorari. We did so, and we shall consider\nboth aspects of the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   We turn first to the question whether the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment was a \u201cblocked asset.\u201d The Ninth Circuit held that\nthe asset in question consisted of Iran\u2019s interest in mili\u00ad\ntary goods, namely an air combat training system, which\nit believed the Executive Branch had failed to unblock\nafter the Iranian hostage crisis ended. None of the parties\nhere, however, supports the Ninth Circuit\u2019s determination.\nAnd neither do we.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The basic reason we cannot accept the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nrationale is that we do not believe Cubic\u2019s air combat\ntraining system is the asset here in question. Elahi does\nnot seek to attach that system. Cubic sent the system\nitself to Canada, where, as far as we know, it remains.\nRather, Elahi seeks to attach a judgment enforcing an\narbitration award based upon Cubic\u2019s failure to account to\nIran for Iran\u2019s share of the proceeds of that system\u2019s sale.\nAnd neither the Cubic Judgment nor the sale proceeds\nthat it represents were blocked assets at the time the\nCourt of Appeals issued its decision.\n   In 1981, the Treasury Department issued an order that\nauthorized \u201c[t]ransactions involving property in which\nIran . . . has an interest\u201d where \u201c[t]he interest in the prop\nerty . . . arises after January 19, 1981.\u201d 31 CFR\n\u00a7535.579(a)(1) (emphasis added). As the Court of Appeals\nitself pointed out, Iran\u2019s interest in the Cubic Judgment\narose \u201con December 7, 1998, when the district court con\u00ad\nfirmed the [arbitration] award.\u201d 385 F. 3d, at 1224. Since\nit arose more than 17 years \u201cafter January 19, 1981,\u201d the\nCubic Judgment falls within the terms of Treasury\u2019s\norder. And that fact, in our view, is sufficient to treat the\nJudgment as unblocked.\n   Iran\u2019s interest in the property that underlies the Cubic\nJudgment also arose after January 19, 1981. As the In\u00ad\nternational Court of Arbitration held, Cubic and Iran\nentered into their initial contract before 1981. But they\nlater agreed to discontinue (but not to terminate) the\ncontract. Arbitration Award G\u201315, G\u201321. They agreed\nthat Cubic would try to sell the system elsewhere. Id.,\n\u00b6C.9.15, at G\u201314. And they further agreed that they\nwould take \u201cfinal decisions\u201d about who owed what to\nwhom \u201conly . . . once the result of Cubic\u2019s attempt to resell\nthe System\u201d was \u201cknown.\u201d Id., \u00b6B.10.7, at G\u201317.\n   Cubic completed its sale of the system (to Canada) in\nOctober 1982. Id., \u00b6B.12.14, at G\u201322. And the arbitrators\n10    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nreferred to October 1982 as \u201cthe date the Parties had in\nmind when they agreed to await the outcome of Cubic\u2019s\nresale attempts.\u201d Ibid. Only then was Cubic \u201cin a position\nto reasonably, comprehensively and precisely account for\nthe reuse of components originally manufactured for Iran\nand for any modification costs.\u201d Ibid. For those reasons,\nand in light of the arbitrators\u2019 findings, we must conclude\nthat October 1982 is the time when Iran\u2019s claim to pro\u00ad\nceeds arose.\n   The upshot is that, whether we consider Iran\u2019s \u201cinterest\nin property\u201d as its interest in the Cubic Judgment itself or\nits underlying interest in the proceeds of the Canadian\nsale, the interest falls within the terms of the Treasury\nDepartment\u2019s general license authorizing \u201c[t]ransactions\ninvolving property in which Iran . . . has an interest\u201d\nwhere \u201c[t]he interest in the property . . . arises after Janu\u00ad\nary 19, 1981.\u201d 31 CFR \u00a7535.579(a). And, as we said, that\nfact is sufficient for present purposes to treat the asset as\nhaving been unblocked at the time the Ninth Circuit\nissued the decision below.\n   Finally, even if we were to assume (as the Ninth Circuit\nheld) that the relevant asset were Iran\u2019s pre-1981 interest\nin the air combat training system itself, we should still\nconclude that that asset was not \u201cblocked\u201d at the time of\nthe decision below. As the Government points out, such\nan interest falls directly within the scope of Executive\nOrder No. 12281, an unblocking order that required prop\u00ad\nerty owned by Iran to be transferred \u201cas directed . . . by\nthe Government of Iran.\u201d See also 31 CFR \u00a7535.215(a).\nNone of the four authorities upon which the Ninth Circuit\nrelied indicates the contrary conclusion. First, the Circuit\ncited the Arms Export Control Act, 82 Stat. 1321, 22\nU. S. C. \u00a72751 et seq., and its implementing regulations, a\nstatute and regulations which regulate arms shipments.\nIt is true that, notwithstanding Executive Order No.\n12281, the export of certain military equipment remained\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsubject to regulation under other statutes, including the\nArms Export Control Act. See 31 CFR \u00a7535.215(c). But\nthat fact does not show that military equipment remained\nblocked under IEEPA. The Court of Appeals next cited the\n1979 Executive Order freezing Iranian assets, Exec. Order\nNo. 12170, 3 CFR 457 (Comp. 1980)\u2014but it failed to con\u00ad\nsider the effect of the subsequent unblocking order just\ndiscussed. The Court of Appeals also relied on a 2005\nPresidential notice extending the national emergency with\nrespect to Iran, 70 Fed. Reg. 69039, but that notice did not\nimpose any additional restrictions on Iranian assets.\nFinally, the Court of Appeals pointed to a Treasury De\u00ad\npartment guidance document, which states that \u201c[c]ertain\nassets\u201d\u2014consisting \u201cmainly of military and dual-use prop\u00ad\nerty\u201d\u2014 \u201crelated to . . . claims\u201d by \u201cU. S. nationals . . .\nagainst Iran or Iranian entities\u201d still being litigated in the\nTribunal \u201cremain blocked in the United States.\u201d Office of\nForeign Assets Control, Dept. of Treasury, Foreign Assets\nControl Regulations for Exporters and Importers 23\n(2007). But the training system does not fall into the\ncategory of assets identified by the guidance document.\nThe system neither \u201cremain[s] . . . in the United States\u201d\n(having been sent to Canada), nor was it related to claims\nby \u201cU. S. nationals . . . against Iran or Iranian entities\u201d\nbefore the Tribunal. In sum, no authority supports the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that an Iranian interest in the\ntraining system itself would be a \u201cblocked asset.\u201d And\nnone of the parties defend the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\nhere.\n                           B\n  Although the Cubic Judgment was not a blocked asset\nat the time the Court of Appeals reached its decision, the\nGovernment believes that it is a blocked asset now. In\n2005 the President issued a new Executive Order that\nblocks assets held by proliferators of weapons of mass\n12   MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\ndestruction. Exec. Order No. 13382, 3 CFR 170 (2005\nComp.). And in 2007, after the Court of Appeals issued its\ndecision, the State Department designated certain compo\u00ad\nnent parts of Iran\u2019s Ministry of Defense as entities whose\nproperty and interests in property are blocked under\nExecutive Order No. 13382. See 72 Fed. Reg. 71991\u2013\n71992. If the Iranian entity to which the Cubic Judgment\nbelongs falls within the terms of the State Department\u2019s\ndesignation, then presumably that asset is blocked at this\ntime.\n   The problem for the Government, however, is that Iran\ndoes not agree that the relevant parts of its Ministry of\nDefense fall within the scope of the State Department\u2019s\ndesignation. Thus the matter is in dispute. The lower\ncourts have not considered that dispute. The relevant\narguments have not been set forth in detail here. And in\nsuch circumstances we normally would remand the case,\npermitting the lower courts to decide the issue in the first\ninstance. See, e.g., F. Hoffmann\u2013La Roche Ltd v. Empa\ngran S. A., 542 U. S. 155, 175 (2004). Consequently, we\nshall not decide whether the new Executive Branch ac\u00ad\ntions have blocked the Cubic Judgment. Instead, we turn\nto the \u201cwaiver\u201d question. And our answer (that Elahi has\nwaived his right to attach the Cubic Judgment) makes it\nunnecessary to remand the blocking question for further\nconsideration.\n                             III\n  As we have just said, the second question concerns\nElahi\u2019s waiver of his right to attach the Cubic Judgment.\nIn 2000, Congress enacted a statute that offers some\ncompensation to certain individuals, including Elahi, who\nhold terrorism-related judgments against Iran.           VPA\n\u00a72002, as amended by TRIA \u00a7201(c). The Act requires\nthose who receive that compensation to relinquish \u201call\nrights to execute against or attach property that is at issue\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin claims against the United States before an international\ntribunal, [or] that is the subject of awards rendered by\nsuch tribunal.\u201d \u00a72002(a)(2)(D), 114 Stat. 1542; see also\n\u00a72002(d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4) (cross\u00ad\nreferencing \u00a72002(a)(2)(D)). In 2003 the Government paid\nElahi $2.3 million under the Act as partial compensation\nfor his judgment against Iran. Brief for Respondent 9.\nAnd at that time, Elahi signed a waiver form that mirrors\nthe statutory language. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30 (citing 68\nFed. Reg. 8077, 8081 (2003)).\n   The question is whether the Cubic Judgment \u201cis at issue\nin claims\u201d against the United States before an \u201cinterna\u00ad\ntional tribunal,\u201d namely the Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal.\nIf so, the Cubic Judgment falls within the terms of Elahi\u2019s\nwaiver. The Court of Appeals believed the Judgment was\nnot \u201cat issue.\u201d 495 F. 3d, at 1030\u20131031. But we find to the\ncontrary.\n   A review of the record in Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal\nCase No. B61 leads us to conclude that the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment is \u201cat issue\u201d before that Tribunal. In Case No. B61\nIran argued that, between 1979 and 1981, the United\nStates had wrongly prevented the transfer of Cubic\u2019s air\ncombat training system to Iran. Iran asked the Tribunal,\namong other things, to order the United States to pay\ndamages. Statement of Claim, Islamic Republic of Iran v.\nUnited States (filed Jan. 19, 1982), App. to Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 22a, 24a, 31a. In its briefing\nbefore the Tribunal, Iran acknowledged that any amount\nit recovered from Cubic would \u201cbe recuperated from the\nremedy sought\u201d against the United States. App. 76, n. 2.\nAnd Iran sent a letter to the United States in which it said\nthat any amounts it actually received from Cubic would be\n\u201crecouped from the remedy sought against the United\nStates in Case B61.\u201d App. to Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 84a. But Iran added that the Cubic Judg\u00ad\nment could not be used as a setoff insofar as it had been\n14   MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nattached by creditors. Id., at 85a.\n   Meanwhile, in a rebuttal brief before the Tribunal, the\nUnited States, while arguing that in fact it owed Iran\nnothing, added that at the very least Iran must set off the\namount \u201calready . . . awarded\u201d by the International Court\nof Arbitration (namely, the $2.8 million awarded to Iran\nfrom Cubic) against any money awarded by the Tribunal.\nId., at 52a, 80a\u201381a, and n. 32. And the United States\u2019\ndemand for a setoff applies even if third parties have\nattached the Cubic Judgment. See Tr. of Tribunal Hear\u00ad\ning, in No. B61 (Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib., Dec. 7 and 12, 2006),\nApp. to Brief for Respondent 37, 38\u201339, 41, 42.\n   The upshot is a dispute about the Cubic Judgment. The\nUnited States argues (and argued before the Tribunal)\nthat the Tribunal should set off the $2.8 million that the\nCubic Judgment represents against any award that the\nTribunal may make against the United States in Case No.\nB61. Iran argues (and argued before the Tribunal) that\nthe Tribunal should not set off the $2.8 million insofar as\nthird parties have attached the Judgment.\n   To put the matter in terms of the language of Elahi\u2019s\nwaiver, one can say for certain that the Cubic Judgment is\n\u201cproperty.\u201d And Case No. B61 itself is a \u201cclai[m] against\nthe United States before an international tribunal.\u201d We\ncan also be reasonably certain that how the Tribunal\nshould use that property is also under dispute or in ques\u00ad\ntion in that claim. Moreover, since several parties other\nthan Elahi have already attached the Cubic Judgment, see\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20, the question\nwhether an attached claim can be used as a setoff is po\u00ad\ntentially significant, irrespective of Elahi\u2019s own efforts to\nattach the judgment.\n   Are these circumstances sufficient to place the Cubic\nJudgment \u201cat issue\u201d in Case No. B61? Elahi argues not.\nHe points out that the Cubic Judgment does not appear on\na list of property contained in Iran\u2019s statement of claim in\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCase No. B61; nor is it the subject of any other claim\nbefore the Tribunal. Indeed, Iran and the United States\ndo not dispute the Cubic Judgment\u2019s validity; they do not\ndispute the Cubic Judgment\u2019s ownership; and they do not\ndispute the fact that the United States\u2019 asset freeze had no\nadverse effect on the Cubic Judgment or on Iran\u2019s entitle\u00ad\nment to the Cubic Judgment. As the dissent correctly\npoints out, the Judgment is not \u201cat issue\u201d in any of these\nsenses. The Judgment will neither be suspended nor\nmodified by the Tribunal in Case No. B61, nor is the\nJudgment property claimed by Iran from the United\nStates in that case, see post, at 2\u20135.\n  But that does not end the matter. The question is\nwhether, for purposes of the VPA, a judgment can never\u00ad\ntheless be \u201cat issue\u201d before the Tribunal even when it will\nnot be suspended or modified by the Tribunal and when it\nis not claimed by Iran from the United States. Here, a\nsignificant dispute about the Cubic Judgment still re\u00ad\nmains, namely a dispute about whether it can be used by\nthe Tribunal as a setoff. And in our view, that dispute is\nsufficient to put the Judgment \u201cat issue\u201d in the case.\n  For one thing, we do not doubt that the setoff matter is\n\u201cunder dispute\u201d or \u201cin question\u201d in Case No. B61, and\nthose words typically define the term \u201cat issue.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 136 (8th ed. 2004). In the event that the\nTribunal finds the United States liable in Case No. B61,\nthe total sum awarded to Iran by the Tribunal will depend\non whether the Judgment is used as a setoff. And whether\nthe Judgment can be so used depends, in turn, on whether\nthe United States is right that an attached judgment\nshould be set off or whether Iran is right that it should not\nbe\u2014a matter in question before the Tribunal. In that\nsense, the Judgment is \u201cunder dispute.\u201d We recognize\nthat the dispute is over the use of the Judgment, not the\nvalidity of the Judgment. But we do not see how that fact\nmatters.\n16    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n  For another thing, ordinary legal disputes can easily\nencompass questions of setoff. Suppose Smith sues a\ncarrier for wrongfully harming a shipment of goods. The\nquestion of liability, the question of damages, and the\nquestion of reducing damages through setoff may all be at\nissue in the case. Which is the more important issue in a\nparticular case depends not upon the category (liability,\ndamages, or setoff) but upon the circumstances of that\nparticular case.\n  Further, the language of the statute suggests that Con\u00ad\ngress meant the words \u201cat issue\u201d to carry the ordinary\nmeaning just described. Elahi essentially distinguishes\nbetween property that is the subject of a claim (a claim, for\nexample, that the United States took or harmed particular\nproperty belonging to Iran) and property that might oth\u00ad\nerwise affect a Tribunal judgment (say, through its use as\na setoff). And he argues that the statutory phrase \u201cat\nissue\u201d covers only the first kind of dispute, not the second.\nBut the statute does not limit the property that is \u201cat issue\nin a claim\u201d to property that is the subject of a claim. To\nthe contrary, the statute says that judgment creditors\nsuch as Elahi must\n     \u201crelinquis[h] all rights to execute against or attach\n     property [1] that is at issue in claims against the\n     United States before an international tribunal [or] [2]\n     that is the subject of awards rendered by such tribu\u00ad\n     nal.\u201d VPA \u00a72002(a)(2)(D), 114 Stat. 1542 (emphasis\n     added); see also \u00a72002(d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA\n     \u00a7201(c)(4) (cross-referencing \u00a72002(a)(2)(D)).\nHad Congress wanted to limit the property to which it\nfirst refers (namely, property that is \u201cat issue\u201d in a claim)\nto property that is the subject of a claim, it seems likely\nthat Congress straightforwardly would have used the\nwords \u201csubject of\u201d\u2014words that appear later (in respect to\nawards rendered) in the very same sentence.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, the statute\u2019s purpose leans in the direction of a\nbroader interpretation of the words \u201cat issue\u201d than that\nproposed by Elahi. Pointing to the statute\u2019s legislative\nhistory, Elahi says that the statute seeks to enable victims\nof terrorism to collect on judgments they have won against\nterrorist parties. See Brief of Respondent 6\u20137, 31 (citing\nH. R. Conf. Rep. No. 107\u2013779 (2002); 148 Cong. Rec.\n23119, 23121\u201323123 (2002) (statement of Sen. Harkin)).\nHe is such a victim, and, he says, Congress would have\nintended an interpretation that favors his cause. But\nCongress had a more complicated set of purposes in mind.\nThe statute authorizes the attachment of blocked assets,\nand it provides partial compensation to victims to be paid\n(in part) from general Treasury funds. But it does so in\nexchange for a right of subrogation, VPA \u00a72002(c), and for\nthe victim\u2019s promise not to pursue the balance of the\njudgment by attaching property \u201cat issue\u201d in a claim\nagainst the United States before the Tribunal. VPA\n\u00a7\u00a72002(a)(2)(D), (d)(5)(B), as added by TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4).\nThe statute thereby protects property that the United\nStates might use to satisfy its potential liability to Iran.\n   The Cubic Judgment falls into this category. It is prop\u00ad\nerty that the United States could use to satisfy its poten\u00ad\ntial liability to Iran, but which may be unavailable for that\npurpose if successfully attached. With respect to the\nstatute\u2019s revenue-saving purpose, it is difficult to distin\u00ad\nguish between property that is the subject of a claim\nbefore a tribunal and property that is in dispute before the\ntribunal in respect to its use as an offset.\n   The dissent adds that the \u201cbetter reading\u201d of the words\n\u201cat issue\u201d is one that limits them to the \u201cfoster[ing] [of]\ncompliance with the Government\u2019s international obliga\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Post, at 6. We agree with this statement, but we\ndo not see how it adds anything but new phraseology to\nthe dissent\u2019s basic claim, namely that arguments before\nthe Tribunal about \u201csetoffs\u201d do not count as \u201cissues.\u201d To\n18   MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nrepeat our own view of the matter, a dispute about\nwhether one country must pay the other country more\nmoney because it cannot use particular property (because\nof an attachment) to satisfy an obligation raises an issue\nthat the Tribunal must resolve, no less and no more than\nother issues that might be before the Tribunal in that case\nor other cases.\n   Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, post, at 8, there is\nno unfairness in our holding. Elahi could have chosen to\nforgo the Government\u2019s compensation scheme, and he then\ncould have attached the Cubic Judgment, as have other\nterrorist victims with judgments against Iran. See Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 20. But that course\ncarried risks: Iran had challenged Elahi\u2019s notice of lien\nand it was uncertain whether Elahi would prevail. In\n2003, while litigation over his notice of lien was pending,\nElahi chose to participate in the Government\u2019s scheme.\nHe thereby received the benefit of immediate, guaranteed\npartial compensation from the Government\u2014in exchange\nfor a promise not to interfere with property that the\nUnited States might need to satisfy potential liability to\nIran. Having received $2.3 million in Government funds,\nthere is nothing unfair about holding Elahi to the terms of\nhis bargain.\n   Elahi makes several other arguments. He points to\nlanguage in the TRIA (the statute authorizing attachment\nof blocked assets) which says: \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other\nprovision of law\u201d the \u201cblocked assets\u201d of a state \u201cshall be\nsubject to . . . attachment in aid of execution\u201d of a terror\u00ad\nism-related judgment. \u00a7201(a), 116 Stat. 2337 (emphasis\nadded). He also points to VPA \u00a72002(d)(4), as added by\nTRIA \u00a7201(c)(4), 116 Stat. 2339, which reads: \u201c[N]othing\nin this subsection [which contains the relinquishment\nprovision] shall bar . . . enforcement of any\u201d terrorism\u00ad\nrelated \u201cjudgment . . . against assets otherwise available\nunder this section or under any other provision of law\u201d\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(emphasis added). The first provision, Elahi argues, per\u00ad\nmits him to attach blocked assets notwithstanding the\nVPA\u2019s requirement that he relinquish his right to attach\nproperty \u201cat issue\u201d before an international tribunal; and\nthat conclusion, he says, is reinforced by VPA \u00a72002(d)(4).\nOur interpretation, he adds, would \u201cbar . . . enforcement\u201d\nof a terrorism-related judgment \u201cotherwise available\u201d\nunder TRIA \u00a7201(a)\u2014contrary to the statutory language\njust quoted.\n   But VPA \u00a72002(d)(5) requires Elahi, in exchange for\nhaving received partial compensation, to relinquish \u201call\nrights\u201d to attach property \u201cat issue\u201d in an international\ntribunal. VPA \u00a72002(a)(2)(D), 114 Stat. 1542 (cross\u00ad\nreferenced by \u00a72002(d)(5)(B); emphasis added). And, as\nseveral courts of appeals have apparently assumed, the\nrelinquishment of \u201call rights\u201d includes the right given by\nTRIA \u00a7201(a) to attach blocked assets. See Hegna v.\nIslamic Republic of Iran, 376 F. 3d 226, 232 (CA4 2004);\nHegna v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 380 F. 3d 1000, 1009\n(CA7 2004); Hegna v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 402 F. 3d\n97, 99 (CA2 2005) (per curiam).\n   Moreover, the relinquishment provision that applies to\nElahi was added to the VPA by the very same statute, the\nTRIA, that permitted the attachment of blocked assets,\nand which contains the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause upon\nwhich Elahi relies. \u00a7201(a) (blocked assets); \u00a7201(c)\n(amending VPA). Congress could not have intended the\nwords to which Elahi refers to narrow so dramatically an\nimportant provision that it inserted in the same statute.\nAnd for those who, like Elahi, argue that the legislative\nhistory supports his reading of the statute, we point out\nthat the history suggests that Congress placed the \u201cnot\u00ad\nwithstanding\u201d clause in \u00a7201(a) for totally different rea\u00ad\nsons, namely to eliminate the effect of any Presidential\nwaiver issued under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71610(f) prior to the date\nof the TRIA\u2019s enactment. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 107\u2013779, at\n20    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n27.\n   Elahi makes three final arguments, first that setoff is\nnot \u201cat issue\u201d because the United States has argued in\nCase No. B61 that it has no liability at all, second that set\u00ad\noff is not \u201cat issue\u201d because the United States has not\nformally asserted a setoff before the Tribunal, and third\nthat the Government violated his due process rights by\ninadequately informing that his waiver would deprive him\nof his right to attach the Cubic Judgment. We find none of\nthese arguments convincing and shall briefly indicate our\nreasons in summary form.\n   As to the first, the United States argued setoff in the\nalternative, thereby placing it, in the alternative, \u201cat\nissue\u201d before the Tribunal. As to the second, Elahi at most\npoints to a ground for disputing the propriety, under\nTribunal rules, for granting a setoff; he does not deny that\nthe Tribunal sometimes can do so, see, e.g., Futura Trad\ning Inc. v. National Iranian Oil Co., 13 Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib.\nRep. 99, 115\u2013116, \u00b662 (1986) (preventing collection on a\nclaim because the claimant had already collected the sum\nat issue from a different party). Hence whether the Tri\u00ad\nbunal can provide for a setoff here is a matter for the\nTribunal to decide, and until it does decide, one way or the\nother, the matter is \u201cat issue.\u201d As to the third, we can find\nnothing that shows Elahi was unfairly surprised by the\nscope of his waiver\u2014certainly not to the point of violating\nany Due Process rights. See, e.g., 14 Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib.\nRep., at 278, \u00b610 (dismissal of Iran\u2019s claim against Cubic\nwas \u201cwithout prejudice to any findings it may make con\u00ad\ncerning [the Cubic contract] in Case No. B61\u201d).\n                           IV\n  We conclude: The Cubic Judgment was not blocked at\nthe time the Court of Appeals reached its decision. We do\nnot decide whether more recent Executive Branch actions\nwould block the Judgment at present. Regardless, Elahi\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

As to Parts I and\nII, the Court is correct, in my view, to hold that the Cubic\nJudgment was not a \u201cblocked asset\u201d when the Court of\nAppeals reached its decision. As to Parts III and IV,\nhowever, respondent Dariush Elahi has not relinquished\nhis right to attach the Cubic Judgment. By holding oth\u00ad\nerwise, the Court departs from the plain meaning and the\npurpose of the statutes Congress enacted to compensate\nElahi and other victims of terrorism.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   The statutory phrase to be interpreted is \u201cproperty that\nis at issue in claims against the United States before an\ninternational tribunal.\u201d Victims of Trafficking and Vio\u00ad\nlence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA), \u00a72002(d)(s), as\nadded by Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA),\n\u00a7201(c)(4), 116 Stat. 2339, note following 28 U.

ELAHI \n\n                  Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nIran-U. S. Claims Tribunal. The word \u201cproperty,\u201d as used\nin the statutory phrase, surely can refer both to tangible\nproperty, such as real estate or valuables in a safe-deposit\nbox, and to intangible property interests, such as a claim,\na cause of action or, as in this case, a judgment rendered\nby a United States district court. Still, it must be ac\u00ad\nknowledged that the term \u201cat issue\u201d is neither precise nor\nmuch illuminated by its operation in cases or other stat\u00ad\nutes. The absence of any clear authority on this point\nmakes it imperative to adopt an interpretation that ac\u00ad\ncords with familiar and well-settled principles of law. In\nthis case those principles are the rules designed to give\nfull and proper respect to final judgments rendered by\ncourts of competent jurisdiction.\n   To determine whether the Cubic Judgment is \u201cat issue\u201d\nin Case No. B61, the primary consideration must be\nwhether the Claims Tribunal, in the exercise of its own\nauthority and jurisdiction, can affect the ownership, dispo\u00ad\nsition, or control of the property the judgment comprises.\nHere the property in question is a judgment rendered by\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District\nof California. As all acknowledge, that court had jurisdic\u00ad\ntion over the subject and the persons then before it. And,\nas is further conceded, that court\u2019s judgment is valid and\nhas binding force on Cubic Defense Systems, Inc., the non\u00ad\ngovernmental party before that court.

In these circumstances the Cubic Judgment\nis simply an extrinsic fact beyond the Claims Tribunal\u2019s\npower to affect. True, the Tribunal, when it enters its own\norders, might or might not give credit to the United States\nfor a payment, or a right to payment, arising out of the\nCubic Judgment; but that does not put the judgment itself\nat issue.\n                            B\n   Even if the Court\u2019s broad reading of the phrase \u201cat\nissue\u201d were correct, the Court\u2019s conclusion would still be\nwrong because the relinquishment provision is limited to\nproperty that is at issue \u201cin claims against the United\nStates.\u201d And the Cubic Judgment is not part of the claims\nIran makes in Case No. B61, as both Iran and the United\nStates have made clear in their submissions to the Claims\nTribunal. To put the countries\u2019 filings in context, a brief\nreview of both the Cubic Judgment and Case No. B61 is\nnecessary.\n   The Cubic Judgment is the result of a contract dispute\nbetween Iran and Cubic. In the late 1970\u2019s, Iran hired\nCubic to build an air combat training system, and ad\u00ad\nvanced some $12 million for the project. But Iran failed to\nmake all the payments due. App. 43\u201344. Thus rebuffed,\nCubic sold the system to Canada and refused to refund\nany of Iran\u2019s advance payments. Iran brought an arbitra\u00ad\ntion against Cubic. The panel of arbitrators, after ascer\u00ad\ntaining Cubic\u2019s costs of building the system, and after\nallowing the company a reasonable profit of $3.5 million,\nordered Cubic to return to Iran $2.8 million of the $12\nmillion advance. Iran brought this arbitration award to\n4     MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v.

The\njudgment orders Cubic to pay Iran $2.8 million. Cubic\nDefense Systems, supra, at 1171, 1174.\n   Case No. B61 is in essence a contract dispute between\nIran and the United States. Iran accuses the United\nStates of breaking its promise, made in the Algiers Ac\u00ad\ncords, to \u201carrange . . . for the transfer to Iran of all Iranian\nproperties\u201d located in the United States on January 19,\n1981. 20 I. L. M. 224, 227, \u00b69 (1981). One of the proper\u00ad\nties Iran claims is Cubic\u2019s air combat training system. See\nStatement of Claim in No. B61, (Iran-U. S. Cl. Trib.), App.\nto Brief for United States 22a, 24a, 31a. Both parties have\nconfirmed, in their joint report describing all the \u201cproperty\nclaimed by Iran,\u201d that Cubic\u2019s system is \u201cat issue\u201d in Iran\u2019s\nclaims. Cover Letter to Final Joint Report (July 14, 1989),\nApp. to Brief for Respondent 14.\n   But the Cubic Judgment, in contrast to Cubic\u2019s training\nsystem, is not part of Iran\u2019s claims in Case No. B61. Both\ncountries made this clear in their submissions to the Tri\u00ad\nbunal. Their joint report does not list the Cubic Judgment\namong the properties \u201cat issue.\u201d Final Joint Report (July\n14, 1989), App. to Brief for Respondent 15\u201323. And, in a\nstatement altogether consistent with that omission, Iran\ntold the Tribunal that \u201c [t]he subject matter of [Case No.\nB61], at variance with the [arbitration] action [against\nCubic], is the losses suffered by Iran as a result of the\nUnited States\u2019 non-export of Iranian properties. \u201d Iran\u2019s\nStatement 16, App. 73, 76.

TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4), 116\nStat. 2339 (amending VTVPA \u00a72002(d)).\n                                II\n   Even if the text of the relinquishment provision were\nsomehow ambiguous\u2014and it is not\u2014then the purpose of\nthe VTVPA and TRIA would tip the scales in Elahi\u2019s favor.\nThe text and the evident purpose of those statutes demon\u00ad\nstrate that Congress\u2019 primary purpose was to compensate\nthe victims of terrorism, not to secure from those victims a\nrelinquishment of their claims to property owned by enti\u00ad\nties found to have sponsored terrorism.\n   The text of the VTVPA, and of the amendments made to\nit by the TRIA, shows that Congress\u2019 primary purpose was\nto enable the victims of terrorism to execute on the assets\nof a state found to have sponsored or assisted in a terrorist\nact. In the first subsection of the TRIA concerning the\nattachment of state assets by victims of terrorism, Con\u00ad\ngress provided that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision\nof law . . . in every case in which a person has obtained a\njudgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon\nan act of terrorism . . . the blocked assets of that terrorist\nparty . . . shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid\nof execution in order to satisfy such judgment . . . .\u201d TRIA\n\u00a7201(a), id., at 2337. The effect of this subsection is to\nensure that other laws do not bar victims\u2019 efforts to en\u00ad\nforce judgments against terrorist states. To like effect is\n6     MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n      FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nanother paragraph of the VTVPA concerning victims of\nIranian terrorism. Entitled \u201cStatutory Construction,\u201d this\nparagraph reads: \u201cNothing in this subsection shall bar, or\nrequire delay in, enforcement of any judgment to which\nthis subsection applies under any procedure . . . .\u201d\n\u00a72002(d)(4), as added by TRIA \u00a7201(c)(4), id., at 2339.\nThough neither provision refers in direct terms to the\nrelinquishment provision, both provisions show Congress\u2019\nintent to broaden, rather than limit, the rights of victims\nlike Elahi to execute on property owned by state sponsors\nof terrorism. Yet the opinion issued by the Court today\ndoes just the opposite.\n   To contravene the statute\u2019s clear design, the Court\nsurmises that Congress also had a \u201cmore complicated\u201d\npurpose, namely, to \u201cprotec[t] property that the United\nStates might use to satisfy its potential liability to Iran.\u201d\nAnte, at 17. This imagined purpose, the Court says, re\u00ad\nquires us to read the relinquishment provision as broadly\nas possible so as to prevent victims of terrorism from\nattaching property. But the Court does not point to evi\u00ad\ndence of this putative purpose, aside from the text of the\nrelinquishment provision itself\u2014a text which, as submit\u00ad\nted above, the Court reads the wrong way.\n   The better reading of the relinquishment provision\u2014and\none much more consistent with Congress\u2019 protective pur\u00ad\npose\u2014is not as a \u201crevenue-saving\u201d device, ibid., but as a\nway to foster compliance with the Government\u2019s interna\u00ad\ntional obligations. If Iran has asked the Claims Tribunal\nto resolve the status of certain property, then Iran and the\nTribunal may well take the position that the United\nStates has a responsibility under the Algiers Accords to\nprevent U. S. nationals from executing against that prop\u00ad\nerty. That concern is not present in this case. The owner\u00ad\nship of the Cubic Judgment is not disputed, and allowing\nElahi to attach it will not affect Iran\u2019s right to obtain full\nrecovery from the United States in Case No. B61.

Ante, at 17. But that agreement is\nhard to square with the Court\u2019s insistence upon fulfilling\nwhat it sees as the statute\u2019s \u201crevenue-saving purpose.\u201d\nIbid. If the Court did in fact believe that the \u201c\u2018better\nreading\u2019\u201d of the statute\u2019s purpose, ibid., is to foster compli\u00ad\nance with the United States\u2019 international obligations,\nthen the Court would affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals. Elahi\u2019s attachment of the Cubic Judgment does\nnot hinder the U. S. Government\u2019s efforts to comply with\nits obligations under the Algiers Accords. At Algiers, the\nUnited States agreed to \u201carrange . . . for the transfer to\nIran of all Iranian properties\u201d located in the United\nStates. 20 I. L. M., at 227, \u00b69. That is not an obligation to\npay Iran money, as the Court seems to believe. See ante,\nat 17. It is instead an obligation to take specific action in\nregard to specific properties. These specific properties do\nnot include the Cubic Judgment\u2014as the Court concedes.\nSee ante, at 9 (holding that the Cubic Judgment was not\nblocked). Therefore, Elahi\u2019s attachment of the Cubic\nJudgment does not impede the United States\u2019 efforts to\nmake good on its obligations under the Algiers Accords.\n   To be sure, a judicial lien on one of the specific proper\u00ad\nties referenced by the Algiers Accords might make it diffi\u00ad\ncult for the U. S. Government to comply with its obliga\u00ad\ntions, under those Accords, to arrange for that property\u2019s\ntransfer to Iran. By encouraging creditors such as Elahi\nto give up their liens on these specific properties that are\nsubject to the Algiers Accords, the TRIA makes it easier\nfor the Government to comply with its obligation to \u201car\u00ad\nrange . . . for the transfer\u201d of these properties to Iran.\nThis purpose (fostering compliance with the United States\u2019\nobligation under the Algiers Accords) is more in keeping\nwith the statute\u2019s text than is the Court\u2019s \u201crevenue-saving\u201d\n8    MINISTRY OF DEFENSE AND SUPPORT FOR ARMED \n\n     FORCES OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN v. ELAHI \n\n                  Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\npurpose. And this purpose\u2014that is, the purpose of ena\u00ad\nbling the United States to meet its obligations under the\nAlgiers Accords\u2014is not in the least frustrated by permit\u00ad\nting Elahi to attach the Cubic Judgment, a property\nthat, as the Court concedes, is not subject to the Algiers\nAccords.\n                            III\n  The facts of this case show the injustice of the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation. The Court today puts an end to Elahi\u2019s\ndecade-long quest to hold Iran to account for murdering\nhis brother Cyrus. In 2000, Elahi won a wrongful-death\nlawsuit against Iran and was awarded some $6 million in\ncompensatory damages. See Elahi v. Islamic Republic of\nIran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569541\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569541/elahi-v-islamic-republic-of-iran/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (DC). In April 2003, Elahi took\nwhat he must have considered a further step toward his\ngoal when he accepted $2.3 million from the U. S. Gov\u00ad\nernment under the VTVPA.\n  After today\u2019s ruling, what once appeared Elahi\u2019s gain of\n$2.3 million now seems to be a loss of $500,000. By taking\nthe VTVPA\u2019s $2.3 million, the Court holds, Elahi relin\u00ad\nquished his right to the $2.8 million Cubic Judgment he\nhad already attached. The practical effect of the Court\u2019s\nruling is to turn the purpose of the VTVPA on its head.\nRather than further Elahi\u2019s effort to obtain compensation\nfor the murder of his brother, the Act has instead set him\nback half a million dollars. For the reasons given above,\nthis result was not what Congress intended when it\npassed the VTVPA.\n                           IV\n  Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence\nProtection Act and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to\ncompensate victims of terrorism. Congress expressed this\npurpose both in the text of the principal provision inter\u00ad\npreted here and in accompanying sections of the statute.\n                Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          9\n\n                   Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nBy stripping Elahi of his right to attach the valid judg\u00ad\nment against Cubic rendered by the District Court\u2014a\njudgment not before the Claims Tribunal in any sense\u2014\nthe Court fails to give the statute its intended effect.\nThese reasons explain my respectful dissent.\n</pre>",
