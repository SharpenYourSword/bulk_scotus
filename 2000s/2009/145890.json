PYETT ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 07\u2013581.      Argued December 1, 2008\u2014Decided April 1, 2009\nRespondents are members of the Service Employees International Un\n  ion, Local 32BJ (Union). Under the National Labor Relations Act,\n  the Union is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees\n  within the building-services industry in New York City, which in\n  cludes building cleaners, porters, and doorpersons. The Union has\n  exclusive authority to bargain on behalf of its members over their\n  \u201crates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of em\n  ployment,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7159(a), and engages in industry-wide collec\n  tive bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations,\n  Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargaining association for the New York\n  City real-estate industry. The agreement between the Union and the\n  RAB is embodied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Con\n  tractors and Building Owners (CBA). The CBA requires union mem\n  bers to submit all claims of employment discrimination to binding ar\n  bitration under the CBA\u2019s grievance and dispute resolution\n  procedures.\n     Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB. It owns\n  and operates the New York City office building where respondents\n  worked as night lobby watchmen and in other similar capacities. Re\n  spondents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service Indus\n  tries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and cleaning contractor.\n  After 14 Penn Plaza, with the Union\u2019s consent, engaged a unionized\n  security contractor affiliated with Temco to provide licensed security\n  guards for the building, Temco reassigned respondents to jobs as por\n  ters and cleaners. Contending that these reassignments led to a loss\n  in income, other damages, and were otherwise less desirable than\n  their former positions, respondents asked the Union to file grievances\n  alleging, among other things, that petitioners violated the CBA\u2019s ban\n2                    14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    on workplace discrimination by reassigning respondents on the basis\n    of their age in violation of Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n    1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7621 et seq. The Union requested arbitra\n    tion under the CBA, but after the initial hearing, withdrew the age\n    discrimination claims on the ground that its consent to the new secu\n    rity contract precluded it from objecting to respondents\u2019 reassign\n    ments as discriminatory. Respondents then filed a complaint with\n    the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging\n    that petitioners had violated their ADEA rights, and the EEOC is\n    sued each of them a right-to-sue notice. In the ensuing lawsuit, the\n    District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of re\n    spondents\u2019 age discrimination claims. The Second Circuit affirmed,\n    holding that Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, forbids en\n    forcement of collective-bargaining provisions requiring arbitration of\n    ADEA claims.\nHeld: A provision in a collective-bargaining agreement that clearly and\n unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is\n enforceable as a matter of federal law. Pp. 6\u201325.\n    (a) Examination of the two federal statutes at issue here, the\n ADEA and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), yields a\n straightforward answer to the question presented. The Union and\n the RAB, negotiating on behalf of 14 Penn Plaza, collectively bar\n gained in good faith and agreed that employment-related discrimina\n tion claims, including ADEA claims, would be resolved in arbitration.\n This freely negotiated contractual term easily qualifies as a \u201ccondi\n tio[n] of employment\u201d subject to mandatory bargaining under the\n NLRA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7159(a). See, e.g., Litton Financial Printing Div.,\n Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 199. As in any\n contractual negotiation, a union may agree to the inclusion of an ar\n bitration provision in a collective-bargaining agreement in return for\n other concessions from the employer, and courts generally may not\n interfere in this bargained-for exchange. See NLRB v. Magnavox\n Co., 415 U. S. 322, 328. Thus, the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision must\n be honored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular class of\n grievances from the NLRA\u2019s broad sweep. See Mitsubishi Motors\n Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628. It does\n not. This Court has squarely held that the ADEA does not preclude\n arbitration of claims brought under the statute. See Gilmer v. Inter\n state/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26\u201333. Pp. 6\u201310. Accord\n ingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down the arbitra\n tion clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union\n and the RAB, and which clearly and unmistakably requires respon\n dents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this ap\n peal. Pp. 6\u201310.\n                   Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n   (b) The CBA\u2019s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under\nthe Gardner-Denver line of cases. Respondents incorrectly interpret\nGardner-Denver and its progeny as holding that an agreement to ar\nbitrate ADEA claims provided for in a collective-bargaining agree\nment cannot waive an individual employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum\nunder federal antidiscrimination statutes.. Pp. 11\u201323.\n     (i) The facts underlying Gardner-Denver and its progeny reveal\nthe narrow scope of the legal rule they engendered. Those cases \u201cdid\nnot involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbi\ntrate statutory claims,\u201d but \u201cthe quite different issue whether arbi\ntration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolu\ntion of statutory claims.\u201d Gilmer, supra, at 35. Gardner-Denver does\nnot control the outcome where, as here, the collective-bargaining\nagreement\u2019s arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and\ncontractual discrimination claims. Pp. 11\u201315.\n     (ii) Apart from their narrow holdings, the Gardner-Denver line of\ncases included broad dicta highly critical of using arbitration to vin\ndicate statutory antidiscrimination rights. That skepticism, however,\nrested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since\nabandoned. First, contrary to Gardner-Denver\u2019s erroneous assump\ntion, 415 U. S., at 51, the decision to resolve ADEA claims by way of\narbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to\nbe free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to\nseek relief from a court in the first instance, see, e.g., Gilmer, supra,\nat 26. Second, Gardner-Denver\u2019s mistaken suggestion that certain in\nformal features of arbitration made it a forum \u201cwell suited to the\nresolution of contractual disputes,\u201d but \u201ca comparatively inappropri\nate forum for the final resolution of [employment] rights.\u201d 415 U. S.,\nat 56, has been corrected. See, e.g., Shearson/American Express Inc.\nv. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 232. Third, Gardner-Denver\u2019s concern\nthat, in arbitration, a union may subordinate an individual em\nployee\u2019s interests to the collective interests of all employees in the\nbargaining unit, 415 U. S., at 58, n. 19, cannot be relied on to intro\nduce a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text. Until\nCongress amends the ADEA to meet the conflict-of-interest concern\nidentified in the Gardner-Denver dicta, there is \u201cno reason to color\nthe lens through which the arbitration clause is read.\u201d Mitsubishi,\nsupra, at 628. In any event, the conflict-of-interest argument\namounts to an unsustainable collateral attack on the NLRA, see Em\nporium Capwell Co. v. Western Addition Community Organization,\n420 U. S. 50, 62, and Congress has accounted for the conflict in sev\neral ways: union members may bring a duty of fair representation\nclaim against the union; a union can be subjected to direct liability\nunder the ADEA if it discriminates on the basis of age; and union\n4                     14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    members may also file age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and\n    the National Labor Relations Board. Pp. 15\u201323.\n       (c) Because respondents\u2019 arguments that the CBA does not clearly\n    and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims were\n    not raised in the lower courts, they have been forfeited. Moreover, al\n    though a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not\n    be upheld, see, e.g., Mitsubishi, supra, at 637, and n. 19, this Court is\n    not positioned to resolve in the first instance respondents\u2019 claim that\n    the CBA allows the Union to prevent them from effectively vindicat\n    ing their federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum, given that\n    this question would require resolution of contested factual allega\n    tions, was not fully briefed here or below, and is not fairly encom\n    passed within the question presented. Resolution now would be par\n    ticularly inappropriate in light of the Court\u2019s hesitation to invalidate\n    arbitration agreements based on speculation. See, e.g., Green Tree\n    Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79.

S. C.\n\u00a7621 et seq., is enforceable. The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit held that this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36\n(1974), forbids enforcement of such arbitration provisions.\nWe disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                            I\n  Respondents are members of the Service Employees\nInternational Union, Local 32BJ (Union). Under the\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as\namended, the Union is the exclusive bargaining represen\ntative of employees within the building-services industry\nin New York City, which includes building cleaners, por\nters, and doorpersons. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7159(a). In this\nrole, the Union has exclusive authority to bargain on\n2                   14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbehalf of its members over their \u201crates of pay, wages,\nhours of employment, or other conditions of employment.\u201d\nIbid. Since the 1930\u2019s, the Union has engaged in industry\nwide collective bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board\non Labor Relations, Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargain\ning association for the New York City real-estate industry.\nThe agreement between the Union and the RAB is embod\nied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Contrac\ntors and Building Owners (CBA). The CBA requires union\nmembers to submit all claims of employment discrimina\ntion to binding arbitration under the CBA\u2019s grievance and\ndispute resolution procedures:\n     \u201c\u00a730 NO DISCRIMINATION. There shall be no dis\n     crimination against any present or future employee by\n     reason of race, creed, color, age, disability, national\n     origin, sex, union membership, or any other character\n     istic protected by law, including, but not limited to,\n     claims made pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights\n     Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Dis\n     crimination in Employment Act, the New York State\n     Human Rights Law, the New York City Human\n     Rights Code, . . . or any other similar laws, rules, or\n     regulations. All such claims shall be subject to the\n     grievance and arbitration procedures (Articles V and\n     VI) as the sole and exclusive remedy for violations.\n     Arbitrators shall apply appropriate law in rendering\n     decisions based upon claims of discrimination.\u201d App.\n     to Pet. for Cert. 48a.1\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Article V establishes the grievance process, which applies to all\n\nclaims regardless of whether they are subject to arbitration under the\nCBA.

S. ____ (2009)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB.\nIt owns and operates the New York City office building\nwhere, prior to August 2003, respondents worked as night\nlobby watchmen and in other similar capacities. Respon\ndents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service\nIndustries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and clean\ning contractor. In August 2003, with the Union\u2019s consent,\n14 Penn Plaza engaged Spartan Security, a unionized\nsecurity services contractor and affiliate of Temco, to\nprovide licensed security guards to staff the lobby and\nentrances of its building. Because this rendered respon\ndents\u2019 lobby services unnecessary, Temco reassigned them\nto jobs as night porters and light duty cleaners in other\nlocations in the building. Respondents contend that these\nreassignments led to a loss in income, caused them emo\ntional distress, and were otherwise less desirable than\ntheir former positions.\n   At respondents\u2019 request, the Union filed grievances\nchallenging the reassignments. The grievances alleged\nthat petitioners: (1) violated the CBA\u2019s ban on workplace\ndiscrimination by reassigning respondents on account of\ntheir age; (2) violated seniority rules by failing to promote\none of the respondents to a handyman position; and (3)\nfailed to equitably rotate overtime. After failing to obtain\nrelief on any of these claims through the grievance proc\ness, the Union requested arbitration under the CBA.\n   After the initial arbitration hearing, the Union with\ndrew the first set of respondents\u2019 grievances\u2014the age\ndiscrimination claims\u2014from arbitration. Because it had\nconsented to the contract for new security personnel at 14\nPenn Plaza, the Union believed that it could not legiti\nmately object to respondents\u2019 reassignments as discrimi\nnatory. But the Union continued to arbitrate the seniority\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nbefore him under the terms of this Agreement.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n\n43a\u201347a. \n\n4                   14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand overtime claims, and, after several hearings, the\nclaims were denied.\n   In May 2004, while the arbitration was ongoing but\nafter the Union withdrew the age-discrimination claims,\nrespondents filed a complaint with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that petitioners\nhad violated their rights under the ADEA. Approximately\none month later, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice\nof Rights, which explained that the agency\u2019s \u201c \u2018review of\nthe evidence . . . fail[ed] to indicate that a violation ha[d]\noccurred,\u2019 \u201d and notified each respondent of his right to\nsue. Pyett v. Pennsylvania Building Co., 498 F. 3d 88, 91\n(CA2 2007).\n   Respondents thereafter filed suit against petitioners in\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District\nof New York, alleging that their reassignment violated the\nADEA and state and local laws prohibiting age discrimi\nnation.2 Petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration of\nrespondents\u2019 claims pursuant to \u00a73 and \u00a74 of the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73, 4.3 The District\nCourt denied the motion because under Second Circuit\nprecedent, \u201ceven a clear and unmistakable union\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Respondents also filed a \u201chybrid\u201d lawsuit against the Union and\n\npetitioners under \u00a7301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947,\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7185, see also DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, 164\u2013\n165 (1983), alleging that the Union breached its \u201cduty of fair represen\ntation\u201d under the NLRA by withdrawing support for the age\ndiscrimination claims during the arbitration and that petitioners\nbreached the CBA by reassigning respondents. Respondents later\nvoluntarily dismissed this suit with prejudice.\n  3 Petitioners also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim. The District Court denied the motion, holding that\nrespondents had sufficiently alleged an ADEA claim by claiming that\nthey \u201cwere over the age of 40, . . . they were reassigned to positions\nwhich led to substantial losses in income, and . . . their replacements\nwere both younger and had less seniority at the building.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 20a (footnote omitted).

Respondents immedi\nately appealed the ruling under \u00a716 of the FAA, which\nauthorizes an interlocutory appeal of \u201can order . . . refus\ning a stay of any action under section 3 of this title\u201d or\n\u201cdenying a petition under section 4 of this title to order\narbitration to proceed.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a716(a)(1)(A)\u2013(B).\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 498 F. 3d 88. According\nto the Court of Appeals, it could not compel arbitration of\nthe dispute because Gardner-Denver, which \u201cremains good\nlaw,\u201d held \u201cthat a collective bargaining agreement could\nnot waive covered workers\u2019 rights to a judicial forum for\ncauses of action created by Congress.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 92, 91,\nn. 3 (citing Gardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 49\u201351). The\nCourt of Appeals observed that the Gardner-Denver deci\nsion was in tension with this Court\u2019s more recent decision\nin Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20\n(1991), which \u201cheld that an individual employee who had\nagreed individually to waive his right to a federal forum\ncould be compelled to arbitrate a federal age discrimina\ntion claim.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 91, n. 3 (citing Gilmer, supra, at\n33\u201335; emphasis in original). The Court of Appeals also\nnoted that this Court previously declined to resolve this\ntension in Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., 525\nU. S. 70, 82 (1998), where the waiver at issue was not\n\u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 91, n. 3.\n   The Court of Appeals attempted to reconcile Gardner-\nDenver and Gilmer by holding that arbitration provisions\nin a collective-bargaining agreement, \u201cwhich purport to\nwaive employees\u2019 rights to a federal forum with respect to\nstatutory claims, are unenforceable.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 93\u201394.\nAs a result, an individual employee would be free to\nchoose compulsory arbitration under Gilmer, but a labor\nunion could not collectively bargain for arbitration on\nbehalf of its members.

S. 36 (1974)] that \u2018Title VII . . . stands on plainly different ground\u2019\nfrom \u2018statutory rights related to collective activity\u2019: \u2018it concerns not\nmajoritarian processes, but an individual\u2019s right to equal employment\nopportunities.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 5 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Gardner-\nDenver, 415 U. S., at 51). As explained below, however, JUSTICE\nSOUTER repeats the key analytical mistake made in Gardner-Denver\u2019s\ndicta by equating the decision to arbitrate Title VII and ADEA claims\nto a decision to forgo these substantive guarantees against workplace\ndiscrimination. See infra, at 15\u201317. The right to a judicial forum is not\nthe nonwaivable \u201csubstantive\u201d right protected by the ADEA. See infra,\nat 9, 24. Thus, although Title VII and ADEA rights may well stand on\n\u201cdifferent ground\u201d than statutory rights that protect \u201cmajoritarian\nprocesses,\u201d Gardner-Denver, supra, at 51, the voluntary decision to\ncollectively bargain for arbitration does not deny those statutory\nantidiscrimination rights the full protection they are due.\n8               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecisely because of the economics of dispute resolution.\nSee Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.

As in any contractual negotiation, a union\nmay agree to the inclusion of an arbitration provision in a\ncollective-bargaining agreement in return for other con\ncessions from the employer. Courts generally may not\ninterfere in this bargained-for exchange. \u201cJudicial nullifi\ncation of contractual concessions . . . is contrary to what\nthe Court has recognized as one of the fundamental poli\ncies of the National Labor Relations Act\u2014freedom of\ncontract.\u201d NLRB v. Magnavox Co., 415 U. S. 322, 328\n(1974) (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n  As a result, the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision must be\nhonored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular\nclass of grievances from the NLRA\u2019s broad sweep. See\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985). It does not. This Court has\nsquarely held that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration\nof claims brought under the statute. See Gilmer, 500\nU. S., at 26\u201333.\n  In Gilmer, the Court explained that \u201c[a]lthough all\nstatutory claims may not be appropriate for arbitration,\n\u2018having made the bargain to arbitrate, the party should be\nheld to it unless Congress itself has evinced an intention\nto preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory\nrights at issue.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 26 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp., supra, at 628). And \u201cif Congress intended the sub\nstantive protection afforded by the ADEA to include pro\ntection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum, that\nintention will be deducible from text or legislative history.\u201d\n500 U. S., at 29 (internal quotation marks and brackets\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted). The Court determined that \u201cnothing in the text\nof the ADEA or its legislative history explicitly precludes\narbitration.\u201d Id., at 26\u201327. The Court also concluded that\narbitrating ADEA disputes would not undermine the\nstatute\u2019s \u201cremedial and deterrent function.\u201d Id., at 28\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In the end, the em\nployee\u2019s \u201cgeneralized attacks\u201d on \u201cthe adequacy of arbitra\ntion procedures\u201d were \u201cinsufficient to preclude arbitration\nof statutory claims,\u201d id., at 30, because there was no evi\ndence that \u201cCongress, in enacting the ADEA, intended to\npreclude arbitration of claims under that Act,\u201d id., at 35.\n   The Gilmer Court\u2019s interpretation of the ADEA fully\napplies in the collective-bargaining context. Nothing in\nthe law suggests a distinction between the status of arbi\ntration agreements signed by an individual employee and\nthose agreed to by a union representative. This Court has\nrequired only that an agreement to arbitrate statutory\nantidiscrimination claims be \u201cexplicitly stated\u201d in the\ncollective-bargaining agreement. Wright, 525 U. S., at 80\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The CBA under\nreview here meets that obligation. Respondents incor\nrectly counter that an individual employee must person\nally \u201cwaive\u201d a \u201c[substantive] right\u201d to proceed in court for a\nwaiver to be \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d under the ADEA.\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(f)(1). As explained below, however, the\nagreement to arbitrate ADEA claims is not the waiver of a\n\u201csubstantive right\u201d as that term is employed in the ADEA.\nWright, supra, at 80; see infra, at 15\u201316. Indeed, if the\n\u201cright\u201d referred to in \u00a7626(f)(1) included the prospective\nwaiver of the right to bring an ADEA claim in court, even\na waiver signed by an individual employee would be inva\nlid as the statute also prevents individuals from \u201cwaiv[ing]\nrights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is\nexecuted.\u201d \u00a7626(f)(1)(C).6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 6 Respondents\u2019   contention that \u00a7118 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n10                  14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Examination of the two federal statutes at issue in this\ncase, therefore, yields a straightforward answer to the\nquestion presented: The NLRA provided the Union and\nthe RAB with statutory authority to collectively bargain\nfor arbitration of workplace discrimination claims, and\nCongress did not terminate that authority with respect to\nfederal age-discrimination claims in the ADEA. Accord\ningly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down\nthe arbitration clause in this CBA, which was freely nego\ntiated by the Union and the RAB, and which clearly and\nunmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age\ndiscrimination claims at issue in this appeal. Congress\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPub. L. 102\u2013166, 105 Stat. 1081, note following 42 U. S. C. \u00a71981 (2000\ned.), precludes the enforcement of this arbitration agreement also is\nmisplaced. See Brief for Respondents 31\u201332; see also post, at 8\u20139\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting). Section 118 expresses Congress\u2019 support for\nalternative dispute resolution: \u201cWhere appropriate and to the extent\nauthorized by law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution,\nincluding . . . arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising\nunder\u201d the ADEA. 105 Stat. 1081, note following 42 U. S C. \u00a71981.\nRespondents argue that the legislative history actually signals Con\ngress\u2019 intent to preclude arbitration waivers in the collective-bargaining\ncontext. In particular, respondents point to a House Report that, in\nspite of the statute\u2019s plain language, interprets \u00a7118 to support their\nposition. See H. R. Rep. No. 102\u201340, pt. 1, p. 97 (1991) (\u201c[A]ny agree\nment to submit disputed issues to arbitration . . . in the context of a\ncollective bargaining agreement . . . does not preclude the affected\nperson from seeking relief under the enforcement provisions of Title\nVII. This view is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of\nTitle VII in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974)\u201d).\nBut the legislative history mischaracterizes the holding of Gardner-\nDenver, which does not prohibit collective bargaining for arbitration of\nADEA claims. See infra, at 11\u201314. Moreover, reading the legislative\nhistory in the manner suggested by respondents would create a direct\nconflict with the statutory text, which encourages the use of arbitration\nfor dispute resolution without imposing any constraints on collective\nbargaining. In such a contest, the text must prevail. See Ratzlaf v.\nUnited States, 510 U. S. 135, 147\u2013148 (1994) (\u201c[W]e do not resort to\nlegislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The\nJudiciary must respect that choice.\n                              B\n  The CBA\u2019s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable\nunder the Gardner-Denver line of cases. Respondents\ninterpret Gardner-Denver and its progeny to hold that \u201ca\nunion cannot waive an employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum\nunder the federal antidiscrimination statutes\u201d because\n\u201callowing the union to waive this right would substitute\nthe union\u2019s interests for the employee\u2019s antidiscrimination\nrights.\u201d Brief for Respondents 12. The \u201ccombination of\nunion control over the process and inherent conflict of\ninterest with respect to discrimination claims,\u201d they argue,\n\u201cprovided the foundation for the Court\u2019s holding [in Gard\nner-Denver] that arbitration under a collective-bargaining\nagreement could not preclude an individual employee\u2019s\nright to bring a lawsuit in court to vindicate a statutory\ndiscrimination claim.\u201d Id., at 15. We disagree.\n                               1\n  The holding of Gardner-Denver is not as broad as re\nspondents suggest. The employee in that case was covered\nby a collective-bargaining agreement that prohibited\n\u201cdiscrimination against any employee on account of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, national origin, or ancestry\u201d and that\nguaranteed that \u201c[n]o employee will be discharged . . . except\nfor just cause.\u201d 415 U. S., at 39 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The agreement also included a \u201cmultistep griev\nance procedure\u201d that culminated in compulsory arbitration\nfor any \u201cdifferences aris[ing] between the Company and the\nUnion as to the meaning and application of the provisions of\nthis Agreement\u201d and \u201cany trouble aris[ing] in the plant.\u201d\nId., at 40\u201341 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The employee was discharged for allegedly producing\ntoo many defective parts while working for the respondent\n12              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nas a drill operator. He filed a grievance with his union\nclaiming that he was \u201c \u2018unjustly discharged\u2019 \u201d in violation of\nthe \u201c \u2018just cause\u2019 \u201d provision within the CBA. Then at the\nfinal prearbitration step of the grievance process, the\nemployee added a claim that he was discharged because of\nhis race. Id., at 38\u201342.\n   The arbitrator ultimately ruled that the employee had\nbeen \u201c \u2018discharged for just cause,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cmade no reference\nto [the] claim of racial discrimination.\u201d Id., at 42. After\nobtaining a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, the em\nployee filed a claim in Federal District Court, alleging\nracial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. The District Court issued a decision,\naffirmed by the Court of Appeals, which granted summary\njudgment to the employer because it concluded that \u201cthe\nclaim of racial discrimination had been submitted to the\narbitrator and resolved adversely to [the employee].\u201d Id.,\nat 43. In the District Court\u2019s view, \u201chaving voluntarily\nelected to pursue his grievance to final arbitration under\nthe nondiscrimination clause of the collective-bargaining\nagreement,\u201d the employee was \u201cbound by the arbitral\ndecision\u201d and precluded from suing his employer on any\nother grounds, such as a statutory claim under Title VII.\nIbid.\n   This Court reversed the judgment on the narrow ground\nthat the arbitration was not preclusive because the collec\ntive-bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.\nAs a result, the lower courts erred in relying on the \u201cdoc\ntrine of election of remedies\u201d to bar the employee\u2019s Title\nVII claim. Id., at 49. \u201cThat doctrine, which refers to\nsituations where an individual pursues remedies that are\nlegally or factually inconsistent\u201d with each other, did not\napply to the employee\u2019s dual pursuit of arbitration and a\nTitle VII discrimination claim in district court. The em\nployee\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement did not mandate\narbitration of statutory antidiscrimination claims. Id., at\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Be\ncause the collective-bargaining agreement gave the arbi\ntrator \u201cauthority to resolve only questions of contractual\nrights,\u201d his decision could not prevent the employee from\nbringing the Title VII claim in federal court \u201cregardless of\nwhether certain contractual rights are similar to, or dupli\ncative of, the substantive rights secured by Title VII.\u201d Id.,\nat 53\u201354; see also id., at 50.\n   The Court also explained that the employee had not\nwaived his right to pursue his Title VII claim in federal\ncourt by participating in an arbitration that was premised\non the same underlying facts as the Title VII claim. See\nid., at 52. Thus, whether the legal theory of preclusion\nadvanced by the employer rested on \u201cthe doctrines of\nelection of remedies\u201d or was recast \u201cas resting instead on\nthe doctrine of equitable estoppel and on themes of res\njudicata and collateral estoppel,\u201d id., at 49, n. 10 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), it could not prevail in light of\nthe collective-bargaining agreement\u2019s failure to address\narbitration of Title VII claims. See id., at 46, n. 6 (\u201c[W]e\nhold that the federal policy favoring arbitration does not\nestablish that an arbitrator\u2019s resolution of a contractual\nclaim is dispositive of a statutory claim under Title VII\u201d\n(emphasis added)).\n   The Court\u2019s decisions following Gardner-Denver have\nnot broadened its holding to make it applicable to the facts\nof this case. In Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys\ntem, Inc., 450 U. S. 728 (1981), the Court considered\n\u201cwhether an employee may bring an action in federal\ndistrict court, alleging a violation of the minimum wage\nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, . . . after\nhaving unsuccessfully submitted a wage claim based on\nthe same underlying facts to a joint grievance committee\npursuant to the provisions of his union\u2019s collective\nbargaining agreement.\u201d Id., at 729\u2013730. The Court held\n14              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the unsuccessful arbitration did not preclude the\nfederal lawsuit. Like the collective-bargaining agreement\nin Gardner-Denver, the arbitration provision under review\nin Barrentine did not expressly reference the statutory\nclaim at issue. See 450 U. S., at 731, n. 5. The Court thus\nreiterated that an \u201carbitrator\u2019s power is both derived from,\nand limited by, the collective-bargaining agreement\u201d and\n\u201c[h]is task is limited to construing the meaning of the\ncollective-bargaining agreement so as to effectuate the\ncollective intent of the parties.\u201d Id., at 744.\n   McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284 (1984), was\ndecided along similar lines. The question presented in\nthat case was \u201cwhether a federal court may accord preclu\nsive effect to an unappealed arbitration award in a case\nbrought under [42 U. S. C. \u00a71983].\u201d Id., at 285. The Court\ndeclined to fashion such a rule, again explaining that\n\u201cbecause an arbitrator\u2019s authority derives solely from the\ncontract, Barrentine, supra, at 744, an arbitrator may not\nhave authority to enforce \u00a71983\u201d when that provision is\nleft unaddressed by the arbitration agreement. Id., at\n290. Accordingly, as in both Gardner-Denver and Barren\ntine, the Court\u2019s decision in McDonald hinged on the scope\nof the collective-bargaining agreement and the arbitrator\u2019s\nparallel mandate.\n   The facts underlying Gardner-Denver, Barrentine, and\nMcDonald reveal the narrow scope of the legal rule arising\nfrom that trilogy of decisions. Summarizing those opin\nions in Gilmer, this Court made clear that the Gardner-\nDenver line of cases \u201cdid not involve the issue of the en\nforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims.\u201d\n500 U. S., at 35. Those decisions instead \u201cinvolved the\nquite different issue whether arbitration of contract-based\nclaims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statu\ntory claims. Since the employees there had not agreed to\narbitrate their statutory claims, and the labor arbitrators\nwere not authorized to resolve such claims, the arbitration\n                      Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nin those cases understandably was held not to preclude\nsubsequent statutory actions.\u201d Ibid.; see also Wright, 525\nU. S., at 76; Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S. 107, 127,\nn. 21 (1994).7 Gardner-Denver and its progeny thus do not\ncontrol the outcome where, as is the case here, the collec\ntive-bargaining agreement\u2019s arbitration provision ex\npressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimina\ntion claims.8\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE  SOUTER\u2019s reliance on Wright v. Universal Maritime Service\nCorp., 525 U. S. 70 (1998), to support its view of Gardner-Denver is\nmisplaced. See post, at 5, 7. Wright identified the \u201ctension\u201d between\nthe two lines of cases represented by Gardner-Denver and Gilmer, but\nfound \u201cit unnecessary to resolve the question of the validity of a union\nnegotiated waiver, since it [was] apparent . . . on the facts and argu\nments presented . . . that no such waiver [had] occurred.\u201d 525 U. S., at\n76\u201377. And although his dissent describes Wright\u2019s characterization of\nGardner-Denver as \u201craising a \u2018seemingly absolute prohibition of union\nwaiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights,\u2019 \u201d post, at 7 (quoting Wright,\n525 U. S., at 80), it wrenches the statement out of context: \u201cAlthough\n[the right to a judicial forum] is not a substantive right, see Gilmer, 500\nU. S., at 26, and whether or not Gardner-Denver\u2019s seemingly absolute\nprohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights survives\nGilmer, Gardner-Denver at least stands for the proposition that the\nright to a federal judicial forum is of sufficient importance to be pro\ntected against less-than-explicit union waiver in a CBA,\u201d id., at 80\n(emphasis added). Wright therefore neither endorsed Gardner-Denver\u2019s\nbroad language nor suggested a particular result in this case.\n  8 Because today\u2019s decision does not contradict the holding of Gardner-\n\nDenver, we need not resolve the stare decisis concerns raised by the\ndissenting opinions. See post, at 4, 9 (opinion of SOUTER, J.); post, at 2\u2013\n4 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But given the development of this Court\u2019s\narbitration jurisprudence in the intervening years, see infra, at 16\u201319,\nGardner-Denver would appear to be a strong candidate for overruling if\nthe dissents\u2019 broad view of its holding, see post, at 6\u20137 (opinion of\nSOUTER, J.), were correct. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\nU. S. 164, 173 (1989) (explaining that it is appropriate to overrule a\ndecision where there \u201chas been [an] intervening development of the\nlaw\u201d such that the earlier \u201cdecision [is] irreconcilable with competing\nlegal doctrines and policies\u201d).\n16              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               2\n   We recognize that apart from their narrow holdings, the\nGardner-Denver line of cases included broad dicta that\nwas highly critical of the use of arbitration for the vindica\ntion of statutory antidiscrimination rights. That skepti\ncism, however, rested on a misconceived view of arbitra\ntion that this Court has since abandoned.\n   First, the Court in Gardner-Denver erroneously as\nsumed that an agreement to submit statutory discrimina\ntion claims to arbitration was tantamount to a waiver of\nthose rights. See 415 U. S., at 51. (\u201c[T]here can be no\nprospective waiver of an employee\u2019s rights under Title VII\u201d\n(emphasis added)). For this reason, the Court stated, \u201cthe\nrights conferred [by Title VII] can form no part of the\ncollective-bargaining process since waiver of these rights\nwould defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind\nTitle VII.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 56 (\u201cwe have long recog\nnized that \u2018the choice of forums inevitably affects the scope\nof the substantive right to be vindicated\u2019 \u201d (quoting U. S.\nBulk Carriers, Inc. v. Arguelles, 400 U. S. 351, 359\u2013360\n(1971) (Harlan, J., concurring))).\n   The Court was correct in concluding that federal anti\ndiscrimination rights may not be prospectively waived, see\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(f)(1)(C); see supra, at 9, but it confused an\nagreement to arbitrate those statutory claims with a\nprospective waiver of the substantive right. The decision\nto resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of\nlitigation does not waive the statutory right to be free from\nworkplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to\nseek relief from a court in the first instance. See Gilmer,\nsupra, at 26 (\u201c \u2018[B]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,\na party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by\nthe statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbi\ntral, rather than a judicial, forum\u2019 \u201d (quoting Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp., 473 U. S., at 628)). This \u201cCourt has been\nquite specific in holding that arbitration agreements can\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe enforced under the FAA without contravening the\npolicies of congressional enactments giving employees\nspecific protection against discrimination prohibited by\nfederal law.\u201d Circuit City Stores, Inc., 532 U. S., at 123.\nThe suggestion in Gardner-Denver that the decision to\narbitrate statutory discrimination claims was tantamount\nto a substantive waiver of those rights, therefore, reveals a\ndistorted understanding of the compromise made when an\nemployee agrees to compulsory arbitration.\n   In this respect, Gardner-Denver is a direct descendant of\nthe Court\u2019s decision in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427\n(1953), which held that an agreement to arbitrate claims\nunder the Securities Act of 1933 was unenforceable. See\nid., at 438. The Court subsequently overruled Wilko and,\nin so doing, characterized the decision as \u201cpervaded by . . .\n\u2018the old judicial hostility to arbitration.\u2019 \u201d Rodriguez de\nQuijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,\n480 (1989). The Court added: \u201cTo the extent that Wilko\nrested on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weaken\ning the protections afforded in the substantive law to\nwould-be complainants, it has fallen far out of step with\nour current strong endorsement of the federal statutes\nfavoring this method of resolving disputes.\u201d Id., at 481;\nsee also Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 626\u2013627 (\u201c[W]e\nare well past the time when judicial suspicion of the desir\nability of arbitration and of the competence of arbitral\ntribunals inhibited the development of arbitration as an\nalternative means of dispute resolution\u201d). The timeworn\n\u201cmistrust of the arbitral process\u201d harbored by the Court in\nGardner-Denver thus weighs against reliance on anything\nmore than its core holding. Shearson/American Express\nInc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 231\u2013232 (1987); see also\nGilmer, 500 U. S., at 34, n. 5 (reiterating that Gardner-\nDenver\u2019s view of arbitration \u201chas been undermined by [the\nCourt\u2019s] recent arbitration decisions\u201d). Indeed, in light of\nthe \u201cradical change, over two decades, in the Court\u2019s re\n18                  14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nceptivity to arbitration,\u201d Wright, 525 U. S., at 77, reliance\non any judicial decision similarly littered with Wilko\u2019s\novert hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agree\nments would be ill advised. 9\n   Second, Gardner-Denver mistakenly suggested that\ncertain features of arbitration made it a forum \u201cwell suited\nto the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d but \u201ca compara\ntively inappropriate forum for the final resolution of rights\ncreated by Title VII.\u201d 415 U. S., at 56. According to the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 JUSTICE   STEVENS suggests that the Court is displacing its \u201cearlier\ndetermination of the relevant provisions\u2019 meaning\u201d based on a \u201cprefer\nence for arbitration.\u201d Post, at 2. But his criticism lacks any basis. We\nare not revisiting a settled issue or disregarding an earlier determina\ntion; the Court is simply deciding the question identified in Wright as\nunresolved. See supra, at 5\u20136; see also infra, at 23\u201324. And, contrary\nto JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 accusation, it is the Court\u2019s fidelity to the ADEA\u2019s\ntext\u2014not an alleged preference for arbitration\u2014that dictates the\nanswer to the question presented. As Gilmer explained, nothing in the\ntext of Title VII or the ADEA precludes contractual arbitration, see\nsupra, at 8\u20139, and JUSTICE STEVENS has never suggested otherwise.\nRather, he has always contended that permitting the \u201ccompulsory\narbitration\u201d of employment discrimination claims conflicts with his\nperception of \u201cthe congressional purpose animating the ADEA.\u201d Gil\nmer, 500 U. S., at 41 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); see also id., at 42\n(\u201cPlainly, it would not comport with the congressional objectives behind\na statute seeking to enforce civil rights protected by Title VII to allow\nthe very forces that had practiced discrimination to contract away the\nright to enforce civil rights in the courts\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). The Gilmer Court did not adopt JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 personal\nview of the purposes underlying the ADEA, for good reason: That view\nis not embodied within the statute\u2019s text. Accordingly, it is not the\nstatutory text that JUSTICE STEVENS has sought to vindicate\u2014it is\ninstead his own \u201cpreference\u201d for mandatory judicial review, which he\ndisguises as a search for congressional purpose. This Court is not\nempowered to incorporate such a preference into the text of a federal\nstatute. See infra, at 20\u201321. It is for this reason, and not because of a\n\u201cpolicy favoring arbitration,\u201d see post, at 1, 3 (STEVENS, J., dissenting),\nthat the Court overturned Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953). And it\nis why we disavow the antiarbitration dicta of Gardner-Denver and its\nprogeny today.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt, the \u201cfactfinding process in arbitration\u201d is \u201cnot\nequivalent to judicial factfinding\u201d and the \u201cinformality of\narbitral procedure . . . makes arbitration a less appropri\nate forum for final resolution of Title VII issues than the\nfederal courts.\u201d Id., at 57, 58. The Court also questioned\nthe competence of arbitrators to decide federal statutory\nclaims. See id., at 57 (\u201c[T]he specialized competence of\narbitrators pertains primarily to the law of the shop, not\nthe law of the land\u201d); Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 743 (\u201cAl\nthough an arbitrator may be competent to resolve many\npreliminary factual questions, such as whether the em\nployee \u2018punched in\u2019 when he said he did, he may lack\ncompetence to decide the ultimate legal issue whether an\nemployee\u2019s right to a minimum wage or to overtime pay\nunder the statute has been violated\u201d). In the Court\u2019s view,\n\u201cthe resolution of statutory or constitutional issues is a\nprimary responsibility of courts, and judicial construction\nhas proved especially necessary with respect to Title VII,\nwhose broad language frequently can be given meaning\nonly by reference to public law concepts.\u201d Gardner-\nDenver, supra, at 57; see also McDonald, 466 U. S., at 290\n(\u201cAn arbitrator may not . . . have the expertise required to\nresolve the complex legal questions that arise in \u00a71983\nactions\u201d).\n   These misconceptions have been corrected. For exam\nple, the Court has \u201crecognized that arbitral tribunals are\nreadily capable of handling the factual and legal complexi\nties of antitrust claims, notwithstanding the absence of\njudicial instruction and supervision\u201d and that \u201cthere is no\nreason to assume at the outset that arbitrators will not\nfollow the law.\u201d McMahon, supra, at 232; Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp., 473 U. S., at 634 (\u201cWe decline to indulge the\npresumption that the parties and arbitral body conducting\na proceeding will be unable or unwilling to retain compe\ntent, conscientious, and impartial arbitrators\u201d). An arbi\ntrator\u2019s capacity to resolve complex questions of fact and\n20                 14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw extends with equal force to discrimination claims\nbrought under the ADEA. Moreover, the recognition that\narbitration procedures are more streamlined than federal\nlitigation is not a basis for finding the forum somehow\ninadequate; the relative informality of arbitration is one of\nthe chief reasons that parties select arbitration. Parties\n\u201ctrad[e] the procedures and opportunity for review of the\ncourtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of\narbitration.\u201d Id., at 628. In any event, \u201c[i]t is unlikely . . .\nthat age discrimination claims require more extensive\ndiscovery than other claims that we have found to be\narbitrable, such as RICO and antitrust claims.\u201d Gilmer,\n500 U. S., at 31. At bottom, objections centered on the\nnature of arbitration do not offer a credible basis for dis\ncrediting the choice of that forum to resolve statutory\nantidiscrimination claims.10\n   Third, the Court in Gardner-Denver raised in a footnote\na \u201cfurther concern\u201d regarding \u201cthe union\u2019s exclusive con\ntrol over the manner and extent to which an individual\ngrievance is presented.\u201d 415 U. S., at 58, n. 19. The Court\nsuggested that in arbitration, as in the collective\nbargaining process, a union may subordinate the interests\nof an individual employee to the collective interests of all\nemployees in the bargaining unit. Ibid.; see also McDon\nald, supra, at 291 (\u201cThe union\u2019s interests and those of the\nindividual employee are not always identical or even\ncompatible.

Absent a constitu\ntional barrier, \u201cit is not for us to substitute our view of . . .\npolicy for the legislation which has been passed by Con\ngress.\u201d Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias,\nInc., 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 18) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Congress is fully equipped \u201cto\nidentify any category of claims as to which agreements to\narbitrate will be held unenforceable.\u201d Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp., supra, at 627. Until Congress amends the ADEA to\nmeet the conflict-of-interest concern identified in the\nGardner-Denver dicta, and seized on by respondents here,\nthere is \u201cno reason to color the lens through which the\narbitration clause is read\u201d simply because of an alleged\nconflict of interest between a union and its members.\nMitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 628. This is a \u201cbattl[e]\nthat should be fought among the political branches and\nthe industry. Those parties should not seek to amend the\nstatute by appeal to the Judicial Branch.\u201d Barnhart v.\nSigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n   The conflict-of-interest argument also proves too much.\nLabor unions certainly balance the economic interests of\nsome employees against the needs of the larger work force\nas they negotiate collective-bargain agreements and im\nplement them on a daily basis. But this attribute of or\nganized labor does not justify singling out an arbitration\nprovision for disfavored treatment. This \u201cprinciple of\nmajority rule\u201d to which respondents object is in fact the\ncentral premise of the NLRA. Emporium Capwell Co. v.\nWestern Addition Community Organization, 420 U. S. 50,\n62 (1975). \u201cIn establishing a regime of majority rule,\nCongress sought to secure to all members of the unit the\nbenefits of their collective strength and bargaining power,\n22              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin full awareness that the superior strength of some indi\nviduals or groups might be subordinated to the interest of\nthe majority.\u201d Ibid. (footnote omitted); see also Ford\nMotor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U. S. 330, 338 (1953) (\u201cThe\ncomplete satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly\nto be expected\u201d); Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Rychlik, 352 U. S.\n480, 498 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). It was Con\ngress\u2019 verdict that the benefits of organized labor outweigh\nthe sacrifice of individual liberty that this system neces\nsarily demands. Respondents\u2019 argument that they were\ndeprived of the right to pursue their ADEA claims in\nfederal court by a labor union with a conflict of interest is\ntherefore unsustainable; it amounts to a collateral attack\non the NLRA.\n   In any event, Congress has accounted for this conflict of\ninterest in several ways. As indicated above, the NLRA\nhas been interpreted to impose a \u201cduty of fair representa\ntion\u201d on labor unions, which a union breaches \u201cwhen its\nconduct toward a member of the bargaining unit is arbi\ntrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d Marquez v. Screen\nActors, 525 U. S. 33, 44 (1998). This duty extends to \u201cchal\nlenges leveled not only at a union\u2019s contract administra\ntion and enforcement efforts but at its negotiation activi\nties as well.\u201d Beck, 487 U. S., at 743 (citation omitted).\nThus, a union is subject to liability under the NLRA if it\nillegally discriminates against older workers in either the\nformation or governance of the collective-bargaining agree\nment, such as by deciding not to pursue a grievance on\nbehalf of one of its members for discriminatory reasons.\nSee Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, 177 (1967) (describing\nthe duty of fair representation as the \u201cstatutory obligation\nto serve the interests of all members without hostility or\ndiscrimination toward any, to exercise its discretion with\ncomplete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary\nconduct\u201d (emphasis added)). Respondents in fact brought\na fair representation suit against the Union based on its\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwithdrawal of support for their age-discrimination claims.\nSee n. 2, supra. Given this avenue that Congress has\nmade available to redress a union\u2019s violation of its duty to\nits members, it is particularly inappropriate to ask this\nCourt to impose an artificial limitation on the collective\nbargaining process.\n   In addition, a union is subject to liability under the\nADEA if the union itself discriminates against its mem\nbers on the basis of age. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7623(d); see also 1\nB. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimina\ntion Law 1575\u20131581 (4th ed. 2007) (explaining that a labor\nunion may be held jointly liable with an employer under\nfederal antidiscrimination laws for discriminating in the\nformation of a collective-bargaining agreement, knowingly\nacquiescing in the employer\u2019s discrimination, or inducing\nthe employer to discriminate); cf. Goodman v. Lukens Steel\nCo., 482 U. S. 656, 669 (1987). Union members may also\nfile age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and the\nNational Labor Relations Board, which may then seek\njudicial intervention under this Court\u2019s precedent. See\nEEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 295\u2013296\n(2002). In sum, Congress has provided remedies for the\nsituation where a labor union is less than vigorous in\ndefense of its members\u2019 claims of discrimination under the\nADEA.\n                            III\n  Finally, respondents offer a series of arguments con\ntending that the particular CBA at issue here does not\nclearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their\nADEA claims. See Brief for Respondents 44\u201347. But\nrespondents did not raise these contract-based arguments\nin the District Court or the Court of Appeals. To the\ncontrary, respondents acknowledged on appeal that the\nCBA provision requiring arbitration of their federal anti\ndiscrimination statutory claims \u201cis sufficiently explicit\u201d in\n24              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v.

In light of\nrespondents\u2019 litigating position, both lower courts assumed\nthat the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause clearly applied to re\nspondents and proceeded to decide the question left unre\nsolved in Wright.

Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 468\u2013469, n. 12 (1983)).\nThis is not an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d As a result, we find that\nrespondents\u2019 alternative arguments for affirmance have\nbeen forfeited. See, e.g., Rita v. United States, 551 U. S.\n338, 360 (2007); Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S.\n51, 56, n. 4 (2002). We will not resurrect them on respon\ndents\u2019 behalf.\n   Respondents also argue that the CBA operates as a\nsubstantive waiver of their ADEA rights because it not\nonly precludes a federal lawsuit, but also allows the Union\nto block arbitration of these claims.

S., at 29, we are not positioned to resolve in the first\ninstance whether the CBA allows the Union to prevent\nrespondents from \u201ceffectively vindicating\u201d their \u201cfederal\nstatutory rights in the arbitral forum,\u201d Green Tree Finan\ncial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79, 90 (2000).

Gardner-\nDenver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974), answers the question\npresented in this case. My concern regarding the Court\u2019s\nsubversion of precedent to the policy favoring arbitration\nprompts these additional remarks.\n   Notwithstanding the absence of change in any relevant\nstatutory provision, the Court has recently retreated from,\nand in some cases reversed, prior decisions based on its\nchanged view of the merits of arbitration. Previously, the\nCourt approached with caution questions involving a\nunion\u2019s waiver of an employee\u2019s right to raise statutory\nclaims in a federal judicial forum. After searching the text\nand purposes of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nthe Court in Gardner-Denver held that a clause of a collec\ntive-bargaining agreement (CBA) requiring arbitration of\ndiscrimination claims could not waive an employee\u2019s right\nto a judicial forum for statutory claims. See 415 U. S., at\n51. The Court\u2019s decision rested on several features of the\nstatute, including the individual nature of the rights it\nconfers, the broad remedial powers it grants federal\ncourts, and its expressed preference for overlapping reme\ndies. See id., at 44\u201348. The Court also noted the problem\nof entrusting a union with certain arbitration decisions\n2               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v.

See id., at 58, n. 19. That concern later\nprovided a basis for our decisions in Barrentine v. Arkan\nsas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 742 (1981),\nand McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284, 291 (1984),\nwhich similarly held that a CBA may not commit enforce\nment of certain rights-creating statutes exclusively to a\nunion-controlled arbitration process. Congress has taken\nno action signaling disagreement with those decisions.\n   The statutes construed by the Court in the foregoing\ncases and in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953), have not\nsince been amended in any relevant respect. But the\nCourt has in a number of cases replaced our predecessors\u2019\nstatutory analysis with judicial reasoning espousing a\npolicy favoring arbitration and thereby reached divergent\nresults. I dissented in those cases to express concern that\nmy colleagues were making policy choices not made by\nCongress. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 640 (1985); Rodriguez de\nQuijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,\n486 (1989); Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500\nU. S. 20, 36 (1991); and Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,\n532 U. S. 105, 124 (2001).\n   Today the majority\u2019s preference for arbitration again\nleads it to disregard our precedent. Although it purports\nto ascertain the relationship between the Age Discrimina\ntion in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), the National\nLabor Relations Act, and the Federal Arbitration Act, the\nCourt ignores our earlier determination of the relevant\nprovisions\u2019 meaning. The Court concludes that \u201c[i]t was\nCongress\u2019 verdict that the benefits of organized labor\noutweigh the sacrifice of individual liberty\u201d that the sys\ntem of organized labor \u201cnecessarily demands,\u201d even when\nthe sacrifice demanded is a judicial forum for asserting an\nindividual statutory right. Ante, at 22. But in Gard\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Because the purposes and relevant provisions of\nTitle VII and the ADEA are not meaningfully distinguish\nable, it is only by reexamining the statutory questions\nresolved in Gardner-Denver through the lens of the policy\nfavoring arbitration that the majority now reaches a dif\nferent result.*\n  Under the circumstances, I believe a passage from one\nof my earlier dissents merits repetition. The Court in\nRodriguez de Quijas overruled our decision in Wilko and\nheld that predispute agreements to arbitrate claims under\nthe Securities Act of 1933 are enforceable. 490 U. S., at\n484; see also id., at 481 (noting Wilko\u2019s reliance on \u201cthe\noutmoded presumption of disfavoring arbitration proceed\nings\u201d). I observed in dissent:\n       \u201cIn the final analysis, a Justice\u2019s vote in a case like\n     this depends more on his or her views about the re\n     spective lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and\n     this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges\n     who have confidence in their own ability to fashion\n     public policy are less hesitant to change the law than\n     those of us who are inclined to give wide latitude to\n     the views of the voters\u2019 representatives on nonconsti\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Referring to the potential conflict between individual and collective\ninterests, the Court asserts that it \u201ccannot rely on this judicial policy\nconcern as a source of authority for introducing a qualification into the\nADEA that is not found in its text.\u201d Ante, at 21. That potential conflict\nof interests, however, was a basis for our decision in several pertinent\ncases, including Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974),\nand Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 35 (1991),\nand in the intervening years Congress has not seen fit to correct that\ninterpretation. The Court\u2019s derision of that \u201cpolicy concern\u201d is particu\nlarly disingenuous given its subversion of Gardner-Denver\u2019s holding in\nthe service of an extratextual policy favoring arbitration.\n4               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v.

S. 506 (1974),\n    there are valid policy and textual arguments on both\n    sides regarding the interrelation of federal securities\n    and arbitration Acts. None of these arguments, how\n    ever, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance be\n    tween judicial and legislative authority and overturn\n    an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been\n    settled for many years.\u201d Rodriguez de Quijas, 490\n    U. S., at 487 (footnote and citation omitted).\n   As was true in Rodriguez de Quijas, there are competing\narguments in this case regarding the interaction of the\nrelevant statutory provisions. But the Court in Gardner-\nDenver considered these arguments, including \u201cthe federal\npolicy favoring arbitration of labor disputes,\u201d 415 U. S., at\n59, and held that Congress did not intend to permit the\nresult petitioners seek. In the absence of an intervening\namendment to the relevant statutory language, we are\nbound by that decision. It is for Congress, rather than this\nCourt, to reassess the policy arguments favoring arbitra\ntion and revise the relevant provisions to reflect its views.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Although Title\nVII, like the ADEA, \u201cdoes not speak expressly to the rela\ntionship between federal courts and the grievance\narbitration machinery of collective-bargaining agree\nments,\u201d 415 U. S., at 47, we unanimously held that \u201cthe\nrights conferred\u201d by Title VII (with no exception for the\nright to a judicial forum) cannot be waived as \u201cpart of the\ncollective bargaining process,\u201d id., at 51. We stressed the\ncontrast between two categories of rights in labor and\nemployment law. There were \u201cstatutory rights related to\ncollective activity,\u201d which \u201care conferred on employees\ncollectively to foster the processes of bargaining[, which]\nproperly may be exercised or relinquished by the union as\ncollective-bargaining agent to obtain economic benefits for\nunion members.\u201d Ibid. But \u201cTitle VII . . . stands on\nplainly different [categorical] ground; it concerns not\nmajoritarian processes, but an individual\u2019s right to equal\nemployment opportunities.\u201d Ibid. Thus, as the Court\npreviously realized, Gardner-Denver imposed a \u201cseemingly\nabsolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal\nforum rights.\u201d Wright v. Universal Maritime Service\nCorp., 525 U. S. 70, 80 (1998).1\n   We supported the judgment with several other lines of\ncomplementary reasoning. First, we explained that anti\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Gardner-Denver also contained some language seemingly prohibit\ning even individual prospective waiver of federal forum rights, see 415\nU. S., at 51\u201352, an issue revisited in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane\nCorp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991), and not disputed here.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

S., at 47.\nWe accordingly concluded that \u201can individual does not\nforfeit his private cause of action if he first pursues his\ngrievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination\nclause of a collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d Id., at 49.\n   Second, we rejected the District Court\u2019s view that simply\nparticipating in the arbitration amounted to electing the\narbitration remedy and waiving the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue.\nWe said that the arbitration agreement at issue covered\nonly a contractual right under the CBA to be free from\ndiscrimination, not the \u201cindependent statutory rights\naccorded by Congress\u201d in Title VII. Id., at 49\u201350. Third,\nwe rebuffed the employer\u2019s argument that federal courts\nshould defer to arbitral rulings. We declined to make the\n\u201cassumption that arbitral processes are commensurate\nwith judicial processes,\u201d id., at 56, and described arbitra\ntion as \u201ca less appropriate forum for final resolution of\nTitle VII issues than the federal courts,\u201d id., at 58.\n   Finally, we took note that \u201c[i]n arbitration, as in the\ncollective bargaining process, the interests of the individ\nual employee may be subordinated to the collective inter\nests of all employees in the bargaining unit,\u201d ibid., n. 19, a\nresult we deemed unacceptable when it came to Title VII\nclaims. In sum, Gardner-Denver held that an individual\u2019s\nstatutory right of freedom from discrimination and access\nto court for enforcement were beyond a union\u2019s power to\nwaive.\n   Our analysis of Title VII in Gardner-Denver is just as\npertinent to the ADEA in this case. The \u201cinterpretation of\nTitle VII . . . applies with equal force in the context of age\ndiscrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA\n4               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n\u2018were derived in haec verba from Title VII,\u2019 \u201d and indeed\nneither petitioners nor the Court points to any relevant\ndistinction between the two statutes. Trans World Air\nlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985) (quoting\nLorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 584 (1978)); see also\nMcKennon, 513 U. S., at 358 (\u201cThe ADEA and Title VII\nshare common substantive features and also a common\npurpose\u201d). Given the unquestionable applicability of the\nGardner-Denver rule to this ADEA issue, the argument\nthat its precedent be followed in this case of statutory\ninterpretation is equally unquestionable. \u201cPrinciples of\nstare decisis . . . demand respect for precedent whether\njudicial methods of interpretation change or stay the\nsame. Were that not so, those principles would fail to\nachieve the legal stability that they seek and upon which\nthe rule of law depends.\u201d CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries,\n553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14).           And\n\u201c[c]onsiderations of stare decisis have special force\u201d over\nan issue of statutory interpretation, which is unlike con\nstitutional interpretation owing to the capacity of Con\ngress to alter any reading we adopt simply by amending\nthe statute. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.\n164, 172\u2013173 (1989). Once we have construed a statute,\nstability is the rule, and \u201cwe will not depart from [it]\nwithout some compelling justification.\u201d Hilton v. South\nCarolina Public Railways Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 197, 202\n(1991). There is no argument for abandoning precedent\nhere, and Gardner-Denver controls.\n                               II\n  The majority evades the precedent of Gardner-Denver as\nlong as it can simply by ignoring it. The Court never\nmentions the case before concluding that the ADEA and\nthe National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S.

If this were a case of first impression, it would at\nleast be possible to consider that conclusion, but the issue\nis settled and the time is too late by 35 years to make the\nbald assertion that \u201c[n]othing in the law suggests a dis\ntinction between the status of arbitration agreements\nsigned by an individual employee and those agreed to by a\nunion representative.\u201d Ante, at 9. In fact, we recently and\nunanimously said that the principle that \u201cfederal forum\nrights cannot be waived in union-negotiated CBAs even if\nthey can be waived in individually executed contracts . . .\nassuredly finds support in\u201d our case law, Wright, 525\nU. S., at 77, and every Court of Appeals save one has read\nour decisions as holding to this position, Air Line Pilots\nAssn., Int\u2019l v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 199 F. 3d 477, 484\n(CADC 1999) (\u201cWe see a clear rule of law emerging from\nGardner-Denver and Gilmer [v. Interstate/Johnson Lane\nCorp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991)]: . . . an individual may prospec\ntively waive his own statutory right to a judicial forum,\nbut his union may not prospectively waive that right for\nhim. All of the circuits to have considered the meaning of\nGardner-Denver after Gilmer, other than the Fourth, are\nin accord with this view\u201d).\n   Equally at odds with existing law is the majority\u2019s\nstatement that \u201c[t]he decision to fashion a CBA to require\narbitration of employment-discrimination claims is no\ndifferent from the many other decisions made by parties in\ndesigning grievance machinery.\u201d Ante, at 7. That is sim\nply impossible to square with our conclusion in Gardner-\nDenver that \u201cTitle VII . . . stands on plainly different\nground\u201d from \u201cstatutory rights related to collective activ\nity\u201d: \u201cit concerns not majoritarian processes, but an indi\nvidual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities.\u201d 415\nU.

Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728,\n737 (1981))).\n   When the majority does speak to Gardner-Denver, it\nmisreads the case in claiming that it turned solely \u201con the\nnarrow ground that the arbitration was not preclusive\nbecause the collective-bargaining agreement did not cover\nstatutory claims.\u201d Ante, at 12. That, however, was merely\none of several reasons given in support of the decision, see\nGardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 47\u201359, and we raised it to\nexplain why the District Court made a mistake in thinking\nthat the employee lost his Title VII rights by electing to\npursue the contractual arbitration remedy, see id., at 49\u2013\n50. One need only read Gardner-Denver itself to know\nthat it was not at all so narrowly reasoned, and we have\nnoted already how later cases have made this abundantly\nclear. Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,\n450 U. S., at 737, provides further testimony:\n    \u201cNot all disputes between an employee and his em\n    ployer are suited for binding resolution in accordance\n    with the procedures established by collective bargain\n    ing. While courts should defer to an arbitral decision\n    where the employee\u2019s claim is based on rights arising\n    out of a collective-bargaining agreement, different\n    considerations apply where the employee\u2019s claim is\n    based on rights arising out of a statute designed to\n    provide minimum substantive guarantees to individ\n    ual workers.\n      \u201cThese considerations were the basis for our deci\n    sion in [Gardner-Denver].\u201d\nSee also Gilmer, supra, at 35 (\u201cAn important concern\u201d in\nGardner-Denver \u201cwas the tension between collective rep\nresentation and individual statutory rights . . .\u201d).

But Gardner-\nDenver forbade union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights in large\npart because of the importance of such rights and a fear that unions\nwould too easily give them up to benefit the many at the expense of the\nfew, a far less salient concern when only economic interests are at\nstake. See, e.g., Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450\nU. S. 728, 737 (1981).\n  3 There is no comfort for the Court in making the one point on which\n\nwe are in accord, that Gardner-Denver relied in part on what the\nmajority describes as \u201cbroad dicta that was highly critical of the use of\narbitration for the vindication of statutory antidiscrimination rights.\u201d\nAnte, at 15\u201316. I agree that Gardner-Denver\u2019s \u201c \u2018mistrust of the arbitral\nprocess\u2019 . . . has been undermined by our recent arbitration decisions,\u201d\nGilmer, supra, at 34, n. 5 (quoting Shearson/American Express Inc. v.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 231 (1987)), but if the statements are \u201cdicta,\u201d\ntheir obsolescence is as irrelevant to Gardner-Denver\u2019s continued\nvitality as their currency was to the case\u2019s holding when it came down;\nin Gardner-Denver itself we acknowledged \u201cthe federal policy favoring\narbitration,\u201d 415 U. S., at 46, n. 6, but nonetheless held that a union\ncould not waive its members\u2019 statutory right to a federal forum in a\nCBA.\n8                  14 PENN PLAZA LLC v.

S., at 58, n. 19), an unacceptable result when it comes\nto \u201can individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportuni\nties,\u201d id., at 51. The majority tries to diminish this reason\ning, and the previously stated holding it supported, by\nmaking the remarkable rejoinder that \u201c[w]e cannot rely on\nthis judicial policy concern as a source of authority for\nintroducing a qualification into the ADEA that is not\nfound in its text.\u201d Ante, at 20.4 It is enough to recall that\nrespondents are not seeking to \u201cintroduc[e] a qualification\ninto\u201d the law; they are justifiably relying on statutory\ninterpretation precedent decades old, never overruled, and\nserially reaffirmed over the years. See, e.g., McDonald v.\nWest Branch, 466 U. S. 284, 291 (1984); Barrentine, supra,\nat 742. With that precedent on the books, it makes no\nsense for the majority to claim that \u201cjudicial policy con\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The majority says it would be \u201cparticularly inappropriate\u201d to con\n\nsider Gardner-Denver\u2019s conflict-of-interest rationale because \u201cCongress\nhas made available\u201d another \u201cavenue\u201d to protect workers against union\ndiscrimination, namely, a duty of fair representation claim. Ante, at 22.\nThis answer misunderstands the law, for unions may decline for a\nvariety of reasons to pursue potentially meritorious discrimination\nclaims without succumbing to a member\u2019s suit for failure of fair repre\nsentation. See, e.g., Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 742 (\u201c[E]ven if the em\nployee\u2019s claim were meritorious, his union might, without breaching its\nduty of fair representation, reasonably and in good faith decide not to\nsupport the claim vigorously in arbitration\u201d). More importantly, we\nhave rejected precisely this argument in the past, making this yet\nanother occasion where the majority ignores precedent. See, e.g., ibid.;\nGardner-Denver, supra, at 58, n. 19 (noting that a duty of fair represen\ntation claim would often \u201cprove difficult to establish\u201d). And we were\nwise to reject it. When the Court construes statutes to allow a union to\neliminate a statutory right to sue in favor of arbitration in which the\nunion cannot represent the employee because it agreed to the em\nployer\u2019s challenged action, it is not very consoling to add that the\nemployee can sue the union for being unfair.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

See, e.g., H. R. Rep.\nNo. 102\u201340, pt. 1, p. 97 (1991) (stating that, \u201cconsistent\nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Title VII in\n[Gardner-Denver],\u201d \u201cany agreement to submit disputed\nissues to arbitration . . . in the context of a collective bar\ngaining agreement . . . does not preclude the affected\nperson from seeking relief under the enforcement provi\nsions of Title VII\u201d). And Congress apparently does not\nshare the Court\u2019s demotion of Gardner-Denver\u2019s holding to\na suspect judicial policy concern: \u201cCongress has had [over]\n30 years in which it could have corrected our decision . . .\nif it disagreed with it, and has chosen not to do so.

But as a treatment of precedent\nin statutory interpretation, the majority\u2019s opinion cannot\nbe reconciled with the Gardner-Denver Court\u2019s own view of\nits holding, repeated over the years and generally under\nstood, and I respectfully dissent.\n",

PYETT ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 07\u2013581.      Argued December 1, 2008\u2014Decided April 1, 2009\nRespondents are members of the Service Employees International Un\n  ion, Local 32BJ (Union). Under the National Labor Relations Act,\n  the Union is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees\n  within the building-services industry in New York City, which in\n  cludes building cleaners, porters, and doorpersons. The Union has\n  exclusive authority to bargain on behalf of its members over their\n  \u201crates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of em\n  ployment,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7159(a), and engages in industry-wide collec\n  tive bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations,\n  Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargaining association for the New York\n  City real-estate industry. The agreement between the Union and the\n  RAB is embodied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Con\n  tractors and Building Owners (CBA). The CBA requires union mem\n  bers to submit all claims of employment discrimination to binding ar\n  bitration under the CBA\u2019s grievance and dispute resolution\n  procedures.\n     Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB. It owns\n  and operates the New York City office building where respondents\n  worked as night lobby watchmen and in other similar capacities. Re\n  spondents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service Indus\n  tries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and cleaning contractor.\n  After 14 Penn Plaza, with the Union\u2019s consent, engaged a unionized\n  security contractor affiliated with Temco to provide licensed security\n  guards for the building, Temco reassigned respondents to jobs as por\n  ters and cleaners. Contending that these reassignments led to a loss\n  in income, other damages, and were otherwise less desirable than\n  their former positions, respondents asked the Union to file grievances\n  alleging, among other things, that petitioners violated the CBA\u2019s ban\n2                    14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    on workplace discrimination by reassigning respondents on the basis\n    of their age in violation of Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n    1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7621 et seq. The Union requested arbitra\n    tion under the CBA, but after the initial hearing, withdrew the age\n    discrimination claims on the ground that its consent to the new secu\n    rity contract precluded it from objecting to respondents\u2019 reassign\n    ments as discriminatory. Respondents then filed a complaint with\n    the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging\n    that petitioners had violated their ADEA rights, and the EEOC is\n    sued each of them a right-to-sue notice. In the ensuing lawsuit, the\n    District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to compel arbitration of re\n    spondents\u2019 age discrimination claims. The Second Circuit affirmed,\n    holding that Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36, forbids en\n    forcement of collective-bargaining provisions requiring arbitration of\n    ADEA claims.\nHeld: A provision in a collective-bargaining agreement that clearly and\n unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is\n enforceable as a matter of federal law. Pp. 6\u201325.\n    (a) Examination of the two federal statutes at issue here, the\n ADEA and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), yields a\n straightforward answer to the question presented. The Union and\n the RAB, negotiating on behalf of 14 Penn Plaza, collectively bar\n gained in good faith and agreed that employment-related discrimina\n tion claims, including ADEA claims, would be resolved in arbitration.\n This freely negotiated contractual term easily qualifies as a \u201ccondi\n tio[n] of employment\u201d subject to mandatory bargaining under the\n NLRA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7159(a). See, e.g., Litton Financial Printing Div.,\n Litton Business Systems, Inc. v. NLRB, 501 U. S. 190, 199. As in any\n contractual negotiation, a union may agree to the inclusion of an ar\n bitration provision in a collective-bargaining agreement in return for\n other concessions from the employer, and courts generally may not\n interfere in this bargained-for exchange. See NLRB v. Magnavox\n Co., 415 U. S. 322, 328. Thus, the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision must\n be honored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular class of\n grievances from the NLRA\u2019s broad sweep. See Mitsubishi Motors\n Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628. It does\n not. This Court has squarely held that the ADEA does not preclude\n arbitration of claims brought under the statute. See Gilmer v. Inter\n state/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 26\u201333. Pp. 6\u201310. Accord\n ingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down the arbitra\n tion clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union\n and the RAB, and which clearly and unmistakably requires respon\n dents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this ap\n peal.

S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n   (b) The CBA\u2019s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under\nthe Gardner-Denver line of cases. Respondents incorrectly interpret\nGardner-Denver and its progeny as holding that an agreement to ar\nbitrate ADEA claims provided for in a collective-bargaining agree\nment cannot waive an individual employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum\nunder federal antidiscrimination statutes.. Pp. 11\u201323.\n     (i) The facts underlying Gardner-Denver and its progeny reveal\nthe narrow scope of the legal rule they engendered. Those cases \u201cdid\nnot involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbi\ntrate statutory claims,\u201d but \u201cthe quite different issue whether arbi\ntration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolu\ntion of statutory claims.\u201d Gilmer, supra, at 35. Gardner-Denver does\nnot control the outcome where, as here, the collective-bargaining\nagreement\u2019s arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and\ncontractual discrimination claims. Pp. 11\u201315.\n     (ii) Apart from their narrow holdings, the Gardner-Denver line of\ncases included broad dicta highly critical of using arbitration to vin\ndicate statutory antidiscrimination rights. That skepticism, however,\nrested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since\nabandoned. First, contrary to Gardner-Denver\u2019s erroneous assump\ntion, 415 U. S., at 51, the decision to resolve ADEA claims by way of\narbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to\nbe free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to\nseek relief from a court in the first instance, see, e.g., Gilmer, supra,\nat 26. Second, Gardner-Denver\u2019s mistaken suggestion that certain in\nformal features of arbitration made it a forum \u201cwell suited to the\nresolution of contractual disputes,\u201d but \u201ca comparatively inappropri\nate forum for the final resolution of [employment] rights.\u201d 415 U. S.,\nat 56, has been corrected. See, e.g., Shearson/American Express Inc.\nv. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 232. Third, Gardner-Denver\u2019s concern\nthat, in arbitration, a union may subordinate an individual em\nployee\u2019s interests to the collective interests of all employees in the\nbargaining unit, 415 U. S., at 58, n. 19, cannot be relied on to intro\nduce a qualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text. Until\nCongress amends the ADEA to meet the conflict-of-interest concern\nidentified in the Gardner-Denver dicta, there is \u201cno reason to color\nthe lens through which the arbitration clause is read.\u201d Mitsubishi,\nsupra, at 628. In any event, the conflict-of-interest argument\namounts to an unsustainable collateral attack on the NLRA, see Em\nporium Capwell Co. v. Western Addition Community Organization,\n420 U. S. 50, 62, and Congress has accounted for the conflict in sev\neral ways: union members may bring a duty of fair representation\nclaim against the union; a union can be subjected to direct liability\nunder the ADEA if it discriminates on the basis of age; and union\n4                     14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    members may also file age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and\n    the National Labor Relations Board. Pp. 15\u201323.\n       (c) Because respondents\u2019 arguments that the CBA does not clearly\n    and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their ADEA claims were\n    not raised in the lower courts, they have been forfeited. Moreover, al\n    though a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not\n    be upheld, see, e.g., Mitsubishi, supra, at 637, and n. 19, this Court is\n    not positioned to resolve in the first instance respondents\u2019 claim that\n    the CBA allows the Union to prevent them from effectively vindicat\n    ing their federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum, given that\n    this question would require resolution of contested factual allega\n    tions, was not fully briefed here or below, and is not fairly encom\n    passed within the question presented. Resolution now would be par\n    ticularly inappropriate in light of the Court\u2019s hesitation to invalidate\n    arbitration agreements based on speculation. See, e.g., Green Tree\n    Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79.

S. C.\n\u00a7621 et seq., is enforceable. The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit held that this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36\n(1974), forbids enforcement of such arbitration provisions.\nWe disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                            I\n  Respondents are members of the Service Employees\nInternational Union, Local 32BJ (Union). Under the\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as\namended, the Union is the exclusive bargaining represen\ntative of employees within the building-services industry\nin New York City, which includes building cleaners, por\nters, and doorpersons. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7159(a). In this\nrole, the Union has exclusive authority to bargain on\n2                   14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbehalf of its members over their \u201crates of pay, wages,\nhours of employment, or other conditions of employment.\u201d\nIbid. Since the 1930\u2019s, the Union has engaged in industry\nwide collective bargaining with the Realty Advisory Board\non Labor Relations, Inc. (RAB), a multiemployer bargain\ning association for the New York City real-estate industry.\nThe agreement between the Union and the RAB is embod\nied in their Collective Bargaining Agreement for Contrac\ntors and Building Owners (CBA).

S. ____ (2009)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner 14 Penn Plaza LLC is a member of the RAB.\nIt owns and operates the New York City office building\nwhere, prior to August 2003, respondents worked as night\nlobby watchmen and in other similar capacities. Respon\ndents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service\nIndustries, Inc. (Temco), a maintenance service and clean\ning contractor. In August 2003, with the Union\u2019s consent,\n14 Penn Plaza engaged Spartan Security, a unionized\nsecurity services contractor and affiliate of Temco, to\nprovide licensed security guards to staff the lobby and\nentrances of its building. Because this rendered respon\ndents\u2019 lobby services unnecessary, Temco reassigned them\nto jobs as night porters and light duty cleaners in other\nlocations in the building. Respondents contend that these\nreassignments led to a loss in income, caused them emo\ntional distress, and were otherwise less desirable than\ntheir former positions.\n   At respondents\u2019 request, the Union filed grievances\nchallenging the reassignments. The grievances alleged\nthat petitioners: (1) violated the CBA\u2019s ban on workplace\ndiscrimination by reassigning respondents on account of\ntheir age; (2) violated seniority rules by failing to promote\none of the respondents to a handyman position; and (3)\nfailed to equitably rotate overtime. After failing to obtain\nrelief on any of these claims through the grievance proc\ness, the Union requested arbitration under the CBA.\n   After the initial arbitration hearing, the Union with\ndrew the first set of respondents\u2019 grievances\u2014the age\ndiscrimination claims\u2014from arbitration. Because it had\nconsented to the contract for new security personnel at 14\nPenn Plaza, the Union believed that it could not legiti\nmately object to respondents\u2019 reassignments as discrimi\nnatory. But the Union continued to arbitrate the seniority\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nbefore him under the terms of this Agreement.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n\n43a\u201347a. \n\n4                   14 PENN PLAZA LLC v.

Approximately\none month later, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice\nof Rights, which explained that the agency\u2019s \u201c \u2018review of\nthe evidence . . . fail[ed] to indicate that a violation ha[d]\noccurred,\u2019 \u201d and notified each respondent of his right to\nsue. Pyett v. Pennsylvania Building Co., 498 F. 3d 88, 91\n(CA2 2007).\n   Respondents thereafter filed suit against petitioners in\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District\nof New York, alleging that their reassignment violated the\nADEA and state and local laws prohibiting age discrimi\nnation.2 Petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration of\nrespondents\u2019 claims pursuant to \u00a73 and \u00a74 of the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.

S. C. \u00a7185, see also DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U.

Respondents later\nvoluntarily dismissed this suit with prejudice.\n  3 Petitioners also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim. The District Court denied the motion, holding that\nrespondents had sufficiently alleged an ADEA claim by claiming that\nthey \u201cwere over the age of 40, . . . they were reassigned to positions\nwhich led to substantial losses in income, and . . . their replacements\nwere both younger and had less seniority at the building.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 20a (footnote omitted).

S. C. \u00a7\u00a716(a)(1)(A)\u2013(B).\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 498 F. 3d 88. According\nto the Court of Appeals, it could not compel arbitration of\nthe dispute because Gardner-Denver, which \u201cremains good\nlaw,\u201d held \u201cthat a collective bargaining agreement could\nnot waive covered workers\u2019 rights to a judicial forum for\ncauses of action created by Congress.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 92, 91,\nn. 3 (citing Gardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 49\u201351). The\nCourt of Appeals observed that the Gardner-Denver deci\nsion was in tension with this Court\u2019s more recent decision\nin Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20\n(1991), which \u201cheld that an individual employee who had\nagreed individually to waive his right to a federal forum\ncould be compelled to arbitrate a federal age discrimina\ntion claim.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 91, n. 3 (citing Gilmer, supra, at\n33\u201335; emphasis in original). The Court of Appeals also\nnoted that this Court previously declined to resolve this\ntension in Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., 525\nU.

Beck, 487 U. S. 735, 739 (1988) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted).

S. 36 (1974)] that \u2018Title VII . . . stands on plainly different ground\u2019\nfrom \u2018statutory rights related to collective activity\u2019: \u2018it concerns not\nmajoritarian processes, but an individual\u2019s right to equal employment\nopportunities.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 5 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Gardner-\nDenver, 415 U. S., at 51). As explained below, however, JUSTICE\nSOUTER repeats the key analytical mistake made in Gardner-Denver\u2019s\ndicta by equating the decision to arbitrate Title VII and ADEA claims\nto a decision to forgo these substantive guarantees against workplace\ndiscrimination. See infra, at 15\u201317. The right to a judicial forum is not\nthe nonwaivable \u201csubstantive\u201d right protected by the ADEA. See infra,\nat 9, 24. Thus, although Title VII and ADEA rights may well stand on\n\u201cdifferent ground\u201d than statutory rights that protect \u201cmajoritarian\nprocesses,\u201d Gardner-Denver, supra, at 51, the voluntary decision to\ncollectively bargain for arbitration does not deny those statutory\nantidiscrimination rights the full protection they are due.\n8               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecisely because of the economics of dispute resolution.\nSee Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U. S. 105, 123\n(2001) (\u201cArbitration agreements allow parties to avoid the\ncosts of litigation, a benefit that may be of particular\nimportance in employment litigation, which often involves\nsmaller sums of money than disputes concerning commer\ncial contracts\u201d). As in any contractual negotiation, a union\nmay agree to the inclusion of an arbitration provision in a\ncollective-bargaining agreement in return for other con\ncessions from the employer. Courts generally may not\ninterfere in this bargained-for exchange. \u201cJudicial nullifi\ncation of contractual concessions . . . is contrary to what\nthe Court has recognized as one of the fundamental poli\ncies of the National Labor Relations Act\u2014freedom of\ncontract.\u201d NLRB v. Magnavox Co., 415 U. S. 322, 328\n(1974) (Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n  As a result, the CBA\u2019s arbitration provision must be\nhonored unless the ADEA itself removes this particular\nclass of grievances from the NLRA\u2019s broad sweep. See\nMitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,\n473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985). It does not. This Court has\nsquarely held that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration\nof claims brought under the statute. See Gilmer, 500\nU. S., at 26\u201333.\n  In Gilmer, the Court explained that \u201c[a]lthough all\nstatutory claims may not be appropriate for arbitration,\n\u2018having made the bargain to arbitrate, the party should be\nheld to it unless Congress itself has evinced an intention\nto preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory\nrights at issue.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 26 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp., supra, at 628). And \u201cif Congress intended the sub\nstantive protection afforded by the ADEA to include pro\ntection against waiver of the right to a judicial forum, that\nintention will be deducible from text or legislative history.\u201d\n500 U. S., at 29 (internal quotation marks and brackets\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted). The Court determined that \u201cnothing in the text\nof the ADEA or its legislative history explicitly precludes\narbitration.\u201d Id., at 26\u201327. The Court also concluded that\narbitrating ADEA disputes would not undermine the\nstatute\u2019s \u201cremedial and deterrent function.\u201d Id., at 28\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In the end, the em\nployee\u2019s \u201cgeneralized attacks\u201d on \u201cthe adequacy of arbitra\ntion procedures\u201d were \u201cinsufficient to preclude arbitration\nof statutory claims,\u201d id., at 30, because there was no evi\ndence that \u201cCongress, in enacting the ADEA, intended to\npreclude arbitration of claims under that Act,\u201d id., at 35.\n   The Gilmer Court\u2019s interpretation of the ADEA fully\napplies in the collective-bargaining context. Nothing in\nthe law suggests a distinction between the status of arbi\ntration agreements signed by an individual employee and\nthose agreed to by a union representative. This Court has\nrequired only that an agreement to arbitrate statutory\nantidiscrimination claims be \u201cexplicitly stated\u201d in the\ncollective-bargaining agreement. Wright, 525 U. S., at 80\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The CBA under\nreview here meets that obligation. Respondents incor\nrectly counter that an individual employee must person\nally \u201cwaive\u201d a \u201c[substantive] right\u201d to proceed in court for a\nwaiver to be \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d under the ADEA.\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(f)(1). As explained below, however, the\nagreement to arbitrate ADEA claims is not the waiver of a\n\u201csubstantive right\u201d as that term is employed in the ADEA.\nWright, supra, at 80; see infra, at 15\u201316. Indeed, if the\n\u201cright\u201d referred to in \u00a7626(f)(1) included the prospective\nwaiver of the right to bring an ADEA claim in court, even\na waiver signed by an individual employee would be inva\nlid as the statute also prevents individuals from \u201cwaiv[ing]\nrights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is\nexecuted.\u201d \u00a7626(f)(1)(C).6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 6 Respondents\u2019   contention that \u00a7118 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\n10                  14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Examination of the two federal statutes at issue in this\ncase, therefore, yields a straightforward answer to the\nquestion presented: The NLRA provided the Union and\nthe RAB with statutory authority to collectively bargain\nfor arbitration of workplace discrimination claims, and\nCongress did not terminate that authority with respect to\nfederal age-discrimination claims in the ADEA. Accord\ningly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down\nthe arbitration clause in this CBA, which was freely nego\ntiated by the Union and the RAB, and which clearly and\nunmistakably requires respondents to arbitrate the age\ndiscrimination claims at issue in this appeal. Congress\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPub. L. 102\u2013166, 105 Stat. 1081, note following 42 U. S. C. \u00a71981 (2000\ned.), precludes the enforcement of this arbitration agreement also is\nmisplaced. See Brief for Respondents 31\u201332; see also post, at 8\u20139\n(SOUTER, J., dissenting). Section 118 expresses Congress\u2019 support for\nalternative dispute resolution: \u201cWhere appropriate and to the extent\nauthorized by law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution,\nincluding . . . arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising\nunder\u201d the ADEA. 105 Stat. 1081, note following 42 U. S C. \u00a71981.\nRespondents argue that the legislative history actually signals Con\ngress\u2019 intent to preclude arbitration waivers in the collective-bargaining\ncontext. In particular, respondents point to a House Report that, in\nspite of the statute\u2019s plain language, interprets \u00a7118 to support their\nposition. See H. R. Rep. No. 102\u201340, pt. 1, p. 97 (1991) (\u201c[A]ny agree\nment to submit disputed issues to arbitration . . . in the context of a\ncollective bargaining agreement . . . does not preclude the affected\nperson from seeking relief under the enforcement provisions of Title\nVII. This view is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of\nTitle VII in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974)\u201d).\nBut the legislative history mischaracterizes the holding of Gardner-\nDenver, which does not prohibit collective bargaining for arbitration of\nADEA claims. See infra, at 11\u201314. Moreover, reading the legislative\nhistory in the manner suggested by respondents would create a direct\nconflict with the statutory text, which encourages the use of arbitration\nfor dispute resolution without imposing any constraints on collective\nbargaining. In such a contest, the text must prevail. See Ratzlaf v.\nUnited States, 510 U. S. 135, 147\u2013148 (1994) (\u201c[W]e do not resort to\nlegislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

The\nJudiciary must respect that choice.\n                              B\n  The CBA\u2019s arbitration provision is also fully enforceable\nunder the Gardner-Denver line of cases. Respondents\ninterpret Gardner-Denver and its progeny to hold that \u201ca\nunion cannot waive an employee\u2019s right to a judicial forum\nunder the federal antidiscrimination statutes\u201d because\n\u201callowing the union to waive this right would substitute\nthe union\u2019s interests for the employee\u2019s antidiscrimination\nrights.\u201d Brief for Respondents 12. The \u201ccombination of\nunion control over the process and inherent conflict of\ninterest with respect to discrimination claims,\u201d they argue,\n\u201cprovided the foundation for the Court\u2019s holding [in Gard\nner-Denver] that arbitration under a collective-bargaining\nagreement could not preclude an individual employee\u2019s\nright to bring a lawsuit in court to vindicate a statutory\ndiscrimination claim.\u201d Id., at 15. We disagree.\n                               1\n  The holding of Gardner-Denver is not as broad as re\nspondents suggest. The employee in that case was covered\nby a collective-bargaining agreement that prohibited\n\u201cdiscrimination against any employee on account of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, national origin, or ancestry\u201d and that\nguaranteed that \u201c[n]o employee will be discharged . . . except\nfor just cause.\u201d 415 U. S., at 39 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The agreement also included a \u201cmultistep griev\nance procedure\u201d that culminated in compulsory arbitration\nfor any \u201cdifferences aris[ing] between the Company and the\nUnion as to the meaning and application of the provisions of\nthis Agreement\u201d and \u201cany trouble aris[ing] in the plant.\u201d\nId., at 40\u201341 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  The employee was discharged for allegedly producing\ntoo many defective parts while working for the respondent\n12              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nas a drill operator. He filed a grievance with his union\nclaiming that he was \u201c \u2018unjustly discharged\u2019 \u201d in violation of\nthe \u201c \u2018just cause\u2019 \u201d provision within the CBA. Then at the\nfinal prearbitration step of the grievance process, the\nemployee added a claim that he was discharged because of\nhis race. Id., at 38\u201342.\n   The arbitrator ultimately ruled that the employee had\nbeen \u201c \u2018discharged for just cause,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cmade no reference\nto [the] claim of racial discrimination.\u201d Id., at 42. After\nobtaining a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, the em\nployee filed a claim in Federal District Court, alleging\nracial discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964. The District Court issued a decision,\naffirmed by the Court of Appeals, which granted summary\njudgment to the employer because it concluded that \u201cthe\nclaim of racial discrimination had been submitted to the\narbitrator and resolved adversely to [the employee].\u201d Id.,\nat 43. In the District Court\u2019s view, \u201chaving voluntarily\nelected to pursue his grievance to final arbitration under\nthe nondiscrimination clause of the collective-bargaining\nagreement,\u201d the employee was \u201cbound by the arbitral\ndecision\u201d and precluded from suing his employer on any\nother grounds, such as a statutory claim under Title VII.\nIbid.\n   This Court reversed the judgment on the narrow ground\nthat the arbitration was not preclusive because the collec\ntive-bargaining agreement did not cover statutory claims.\nAs a result, the lower courts erred in relying on the \u201cdoc\ntrine of election of remedies\u201d to bar the employee\u2019s Title\nVII claim. Id., at 49. \u201cThat doctrine, which refers to\nsituations where an individual pursues remedies that are\nlegally or factually inconsistent\u201d with each other, did not\napply to the employee\u2019s dual pursuit of arbitration and a\nTitle VII discrimination claim in district court. The em\nployee\u2019s collective-bargaining agreement did not mandate\narbitration of statutory antidiscrimination claims. Id., at\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Be\ncause the collective-bargaining agreement gave the arbi\ntrator \u201cauthority to resolve only questions of contractual\nrights,\u201d his decision could not prevent the employee from\nbringing the Title VII claim in federal court \u201cregardless of\nwhether certain contractual rights are similar to, or dupli\ncative of, the substantive rights secured by Title VII.\u201d Id.,\nat 53\u201354; see also id., at 50.\n   The Court also explained that the employee had not\nwaived his right to pursue his Title VII claim in federal\ncourt by participating in an arbitration that was premised\non the same underlying facts as the Title VII claim. See\nid., at 52. Thus, whether the legal theory of preclusion\nadvanced by the employer rested on \u201cthe doctrines of\nelection of remedies\u201d or was recast \u201cas resting instead on\nthe doctrine of equitable estoppel and on themes of res\njudicata and collateral estoppel,\u201d id., at 49, n. 10 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), it could not prevail in light of\nthe collective-bargaining agreement\u2019s failure to address\narbitration of Title VII claims. See id., at 46, n. 6 (\u201c[W]e\nhold that the federal policy favoring arbitration does not\nestablish that an arbitrator\u2019s resolution of a contractual\nclaim is dispositive of a statutory claim under Title VII\u201d\n(emphasis added)).\n   The Court\u2019s decisions following Gardner-Denver have\nnot broadened its holding to make it applicable to the facts\nof this case. In Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys\ntem, Inc., 450 U. S. 728 (1981), the Court considered\n\u201cwhether an employee may bring an action in federal\ndistrict court, alleging a violation of the minimum wage\nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, . . . after\nhaving unsuccessfully submitted a wage claim based on\nthe same underlying facts to a joint grievance committee\npursuant to the provisions of his union\u2019s collective\nbargaining agreement.\u201d Id., at 729\u2013730. The Court held\n14              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the unsuccessful arbitration did not preclude the\nfederal lawsuit. Like the collective-bargaining agreement\nin Gardner-Denver, the arbitration provision under review\nin Barrentine did not expressly reference the statutory\nclaim at issue. See 450 U. S., at 731, n. 5. The Court thus\nreiterated that an \u201carbitrator\u2019s power is both derived from,\nand limited by, the collective-bargaining agreement\u201d and\n\u201c[h]is task is limited to construing the meaning of the\ncollective-bargaining agreement so as to effectuate the\ncollective intent of the parties.\u201d Id., at 744.\n   McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284 (1984), was\ndecided along similar lines. The question presented in\nthat case was \u201cwhether a federal court may accord preclu\nsive effect to an unappealed arbitration award in a case\nbrought under [42 U. S. C. \u00a71983].\u201d Id., at 285. The Court\ndeclined to fashion such a rule, again explaining that\n\u201cbecause an arbitrator\u2019s authority derives solely from the\ncontract, Barrentine, supra, at 744, an arbitrator may not\nhave authority to enforce \u00a71983\u201d when that provision is\nleft unaddressed by the arbitration agreement. Id., at\n290. Accordingly, as in both Gardner-Denver and Barren\ntine, the Court\u2019s decision in McDonald hinged on the scope\nof the collective-bargaining agreement and the arbitrator\u2019s\nparallel mandate.\n   The facts underlying Gardner-Denver, Barrentine, and\nMcDonald reveal the narrow scope of the legal rule arising\nfrom that trilogy of decisions. Summarizing those opin\nions in Gilmer, this Court made clear that the Gardner-\nDenver line of cases \u201cdid not involve the issue of the en\nforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims.\u201d\n500 U. S., at 35. Those decisions instead \u201cinvolved the\nquite different issue whether arbitration of contract-based\nclaims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statu\ntory claims. Since the employees there had not agreed to\narbitrate their statutory claims, and the labor arbitrators\nwere not authorized to resolve such claims, the arbitration\n                      Cite as: 556 U.

S., at 76; Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S. 107, 127,\nn. 21 (1994).7 Gardner-Denver and its progeny thus do not\ncontrol the outcome where, as is the case here, the collec\ntive-bargaining agreement\u2019s arbitration provision ex\npressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimina\ntion claims.8\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE  SOUTER\u2019s reliance on Wright v. Universal Maritime Service\nCorp., 525 U. S. 70 (1998), to support its view of Gardner-Denver is\nmisplaced. See post, at 5, 7. Wright identified the \u201ctension\u201d between\nthe two lines of cases represented by Gardner-Denver and Gilmer, but\nfound \u201cit unnecessary to resolve the question of the validity of a union\nnegotiated waiver, since it [was] apparent . . . on the facts and argu\nments presented . . . that no such waiver [had] occurred.\u201d 525 U. S., at\n76\u201377. And although his dissent describes Wright\u2019s characterization of\nGardner-Denver as \u201craising a \u2018seemingly absolute prohibition of union\nwaiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights,\u2019 \u201d post, at 7 (quoting Wright,\n525 U. S., at 80), it wrenches the statement out of context: \u201cAlthough\n[the right to a judicial forum] is not a substantive right, see Gilmer, 500\nU. S., at 26, and whether or not Gardner-Denver\u2019s seemingly absolute\nprohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights survives\nGilmer, Gardner-Denver at least stands for the proposition that the\nright to a federal judicial forum is of sufficient importance to be pro\ntected against less-than-explicit union waiver in a CBA,\u201d id., at 80\n(emphasis added). Wright therefore neither endorsed Gardner-Denver\u2019s\nbroad language nor suggested a particular result in this case.\n  8 Because today\u2019s decision does not contradict the holding of Gardner-\n\nDenver, we need not resolve the stare decisis concerns raised by the\ndissenting opinions. See post, at 4, 9 (opinion of SOUTER, J.); post, at 2\u2013\n4 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But given the development of this Court\u2019s\narbitration jurisprudence in the intervening years, see infra, at 16\u201319,\nGardner-Denver would appear to be a strong candidate for overruling if\nthe dissents\u2019 broad view of its holding, see post, at 6\u20137 (opinion of\nSOUTER, J.), were correct. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491\nU. S. 164, 173 (1989) (explaining that it is appropriate to overrule a\ndecision where there \u201chas been [an] intervening development of the\nlaw\u201d such that the earlier \u201cdecision [is] irreconcilable with competing\nlegal doctrines and policies\u201d).\n16              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               2\n   We recognize that apart from their narrow holdings, the\nGardner-Denver line of cases included broad dicta that\nwas highly critical of the use of arbitration for the vindica\ntion of statutory antidiscrimination rights. That skepti\ncism, however, rested on a misconceived view of arbitra\ntion that this Court has since abandoned.\n   First, the Court in Gardner-Denver erroneously as\nsumed that an agreement to submit statutory discrimina\ntion claims to arbitration was tantamount to a waiver of\nthose rights. See 415 U. S., at 51. (\u201c[T]here can be no\nprospective waiver of an employee\u2019s rights under Title VII\u201d\n(emphasis added)). For this reason, the Court stated, \u201cthe\nrights conferred [by Title VII] can form no part of the\ncollective-bargaining process since waiver of these rights\nwould defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind\nTitle VII.\u201d Ibid.; see also id., at 56 (\u201cwe have long recog\nnized that \u2018the choice of forums inevitably affects the scope\nof the substantive right to be vindicated\u2019 \u201d (quoting U. S.\nBulk Carriers, Inc. v. Arguelles, 400 U. S. 351, 359\u2013360\n(1971) (Harlan, J., concurring))).\n   The Court was correct in concluding that federal anti\ndiscrimination rights may not be prospectively waived, see\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7626(f)(1)(C); see supra, at 9, but it confused an\nagreement to arbitrate those statutory claims with a\nprospective waiver of the substantive right. The decision\nto resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of\nlitigation does not waive the statutory right to be free from\nworkplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to\nseek relief from a court in the first instance. See Gilmer,\nsupra, at 26 (\u201c \u2018[B]y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,\na party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by\nthe statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbi\ntral, rather than a judicial, forum\u2019 \u201d (quoting Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp., 473 U. S., at 628)). This \u201cCourt has been\nquite specific in holding that arbitration agreements can\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbe enforced under the FAA without contravening the\npolicies of congressional enactments giving employees\nspecific protection against discrimination prohibited by\nfederal law.\u201d Circuit City Stores, Inc., 532 U. S., at 123.\nThe suggestion in Gardner-Denver that the decision to\narbitrate statutory discrimination claims was tantamount\nto a substantive waiver of those rights, therefore, reveals a\ndistorted understanding of the compromise made when an\nemployee agrees to compulsory arbitration.\n   In this respect, Gardner-Denver is a direct descendant of\nthe Court\u2019s decision in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427\n(1953), which held that an agreement to arbitrate claims\nunder the Securities Act of 1933 was unenforceable. See\nid., at 438. The Court subsequently overruled Wilko and,\nin so doing, characterized the decision as \u201cpervaded by . . .\n\u2018the old judicial hostility to arbitration.\u2019 \u201d Rodriguez de\nQuijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,\n480 (1989). The Court added: \u201cTo the extent that Wilko\nrested on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weaken\ning the protections afforded in the substantive law to\nwould-be complainants, it has fallen far out of step with\nour current strong endorsement of the federal statutes\nfavoring this method of resolving disputes.\u201d Id., at 481;\nsee also Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 626\u2013627 (\u201c[W]e\nare well past the time when judicial suspicion of the desir\nability of arbitration and of the competence of arbitral\ntribunals inhibited the development of arbitration as an\nalternative means of dispute resolution\u201d). The timeworn\n\u201cmistrust of the arbitral process\u201d harbored by the Court in\nGardner-Denver thus weighs against reliance on anything\nmore than its core holding. Shearson/American Express\nInc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 231\u2013232 (1987); see also\nGilmer, 500 U. S., at 34, n. 5 (reiterating that Gardner-\nDenver\u2019s view of arbitration \u201chas been undermined by [the\nCourt\u2019s] recent arbitration decisions\u201d). Indeed, in light of\nthe \u201cradical change, over two decades, in the Court\u2019s re\n18                  14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nceptivity to arbitration,\u201d Wright, 525 U. S., at 77, reliance\non any judicial decision similarly littered with Wilko\u2019s\novert hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agree\nments would be ill advised. 9\n   Second, Gardner-Denver mistakenly suggested that\ncertain features of arbitration made it a forum \u201cwell suited\nto the resolution of contractual disputes,\u201d but \u201ca compara\ntively inappropriate forum for the final resolution of rights\ncreated by Title VII.\u201d 415 U. S., at 56. According to the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 JUSTICE   STEVENS suggests that the Court is displacing its \u201cearlier\ndetermination of the relevant provisions\u2019 meaning\u201d based on a \u201cprefer\nence for arbitration.\u201d Post, at 2. But his criticism lacks any basis. We\nare not revisiting a settled issue or disregarding an earlier determina\ntion; the Court is simply deciding the question identified in Wright as\nunresolved. See supra, at 5\u20136; see also infra, at 23\u201324. And, contrary\nto JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 accusation, it is the Court\u2019s fidelity to the ADEA\u2019s\ntext\u2014not an alleged preference for arbitration\u2014that dictates the\nanswer to the question presented. As Gilmer explained, nothing in the\ntext of Title VII or the ADEA precludes contractual arbitration, see\nsupra, at 8\u20139, and JUSTICE STEVENS has never suggested otherwise.\nRather, he has always contended that permitting the \u201ccompulsory\narbitration\u201d of employment discrimination claims conflicts with his\nperception of \u201cthe congressional purpose animating the ADEA.\u201d Gil\nmer, 500 U. S., at 41 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); see also id., at 42\n(\u201cPlainly, it would not comport with the congressional objectives behind\na statute seeking to enforce civil rights protected by Title VII to allow\nthe very forces that had practiced discrimination to contract away the\nright to enforce civil rights in the courts\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). The Gilmer Court did not adopt JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 personal\nview of the purposes underlying the ADEA, for good reason: That view\nis not embodied within the statute\u2019s text. Accordingly, it is not the\nstatutory text that JUSTICE STEVENS has sought to vindicate\u2014it is\ninstead his own \u201cpreference\u201d for mandatory judicial review, which he\ndisguises as a search for congressional purpose. This Court is not\nempowered to incorporate such a preference into the text of a federal\nstatute. See infra, at 20\u201321. It is for this reason, and not because of a\n\u201cpolicy favoring arbitration,\u201d see post, at 1, 3 (STEVENS, J., dissenting),\nthat the Court overturned Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953). And it\nis why we disavow the antiarbitration dicta of Gardner-Denver and its\nprogeny today.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt, the \u201cfactfinding process in arbitration\u201d is \u201cnot\nequivalent to judicial factfinding\u201d and the \u201cinformality of\narbitral procedure . . . makes arbitration a less appropri\nate forum for final resolution of Title VII issues than the\nfederal courts.\u201d Id., at 57, 58. The Court also questioned\nthe competence of arbitrators to decide federal statutory\nclaims. See id., at 57 (\u201c[T]he specialized competence of\narbitrators pertains primarily to the law of the shop, not\nthe law of the land\u201d); Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 743 (\u201cAl\nthough an arbitrator may be competent to resolve many\npreliminary factual questions, such as whether the em\nployee \u2018punched in\u2019 when he said he did, he may lack\ncompetence to decide the ultimate legal issue whether an\nemployee\u2019s right to a minimum wage or to overtime pay\nunder the statute has been violated\u201d). In the Court\u2019s view,\n\u201cthe resolution of statutory or constitutional issues is a\nprimary responsibility of courts, and judicial construction\nhas proved especially necessary with respect to Title VII,\nwhose broad language frequently can be given meaning\nonly by reference to public law concepts.\u201d Gardner-\nDenver, supra, at 57; see also McDonald, 466 U. S., at 290\n(\u201cAn arbitrator may not . . . have the expertise required to\nresolve the complex legal questions that arise in \u00a71983\nactions\u201d).\n   These misconceptions have been corrected. For exam\nple, the Court has \u201crecognized that arbitral tribunals are\nreadily capable of handling the factual and legal complexi\nties of antitrust claims, notwithstanding the absence of\njudicial instruction and supervision\u201d and that \u201cthere is no\nreason to assume at the outset that arbitrators will not\nfollow the law.\u201d McMahon, supra, at 232; Mitsubishi\nMotors Corp., 473 U. S., at 634 (\u201cWe decline to indulge the\npresumption that the parties and arbitral body conducting\na proceeding will be unable or unwilling to retain compe\ntent, conscientious, and impartial arbitrators\u201d). An arbi\ntrator\u2019s capacity to resolve complex questions of fact and\n20                 14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw extends with equal force to discrimination claims\nbrought under the ADEA. Moreover, the recognition that\narbitration procedures are more streamlined than federal\nlitigation is not a basis for finding the forum somehow\ninadequate; the relative informality of arbitration is one of\nthe chief reasons that parties select arbitration. Parties\n\u201ctrad[e] the procedures and opportunity for review of the\ncourtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of\narbitration.\u201d Id., at 628. In any event, \u201c[i]t is unlikely . . .\nthat age discrimination claims require more extensive\ndiscovery than other claims that we have found to be\narbitrable, such as RICO and antitrust claims.\u201d Gilmer,\n500 U. S., at 31. At bottom, objections centered on the\nnature of arbitration do not offer a credible basis for dis\ncrediting the choice of that forum to resolve statutory\nantidiscrimination claims.10\n   Third, the Court in Gardner-Denver raised in a footnote\na \u201cfurther concern\u201d regarding \u201cthe union\u2019s exclusive con\ntrol over the manner and extent to which an individual\ngrievance is presented.\u201d 415 U. S., at 58, n. 19. The Court\nsuggested that in arbitration, as in the collective\nbargaining process, a union may subordinate the interests\nof an individual employee to the collective interests of all\nemployees in the bargaining unit. Ibid.; see also McDon\nald, supra, at 291 (\u201cThe union\u2019s interests and those of the\nindividual employee are not always identical or even\ncompatible.

Congress is fully equipped \u201cto\nidentify any category of claims as to which agreements to\narbitrate will be held unenforceable.\u201d Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp., supra, at 627. Until Congress amends the ADEA to\nmeet the conflict-of-interest concern identified in the\nGardner-Denver dicta, and seized on by respondents here,\nthere is \u201cno reason to color the lens through which the\narbitration clause is read\u201d simply because of an alleged\nconflict of interest between a union and its members.\nMitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, at 628. This is a \u201cbattl[e]\nthat should be fought among the political branches and\nthe industry. Those parties should not seek to amend the\nstatute by appeal to the Judicial Branch.\u201d Barnhart v.\nSigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002).\n   The conflict-of-interest argument also proves too much.\nLabor unions certainly balance the economic interests of\nsome employees against the needs of the larger work force\nas they negotiate collective-bargain agreements and im\nplement them on a daily basis. But this attribute of or\nganized labor does not justify singling out an arbitration\nprovision for disfavored treatment. This \u201cprinciple of\nmajority rule\u201d to which respondents object is in fact the\ncentral premise of the NLRA. Emporium Capwell Co. v.\nWestern Addition Community Organization, 420 U. S. 50,\n62 (1975). \u201cIn establishing a regime of majority rule,\nCongress sought to secure to all members of the unit the\nbenefits of their collective strength and bargaining power,\n22              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin full awareness that the superior strength of some indi\nviduals or groups might be subordinated to the interest of\nthe majority.\u201d Ibid. (footnote omitted); see also Ford\nMotor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U. S. 330, 338 (1953) (\u201cThe\ncomplete satisfaction of all who are represented is hardly\nto be expected\u201d); Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Rychlik, 352 U. S.\n480, 498 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). It was Con\ngress\u2019 verdict that the benefits of organized labor outweigh\nthe sacrifice of individual liberty that this system neces\nsarily demands. Respondents\u2019 argument that they were\ndeprived of the right to pursue their ADEA claims in\nfederal court by a labor union with a conflict of interest is\ntherefore unsustainable; it amounts to a collateral attack\non the NLRA.\n   In any event, Congress has accounted for this conflict of\ninterest in several ways. As indicated above, the NLRA\nhas been interpreted to impose a \u201cduty of fair representa\ntion\u201d on labor unions, which a union breaches \u201cwhen its\nconduct toward a member of the bargaining unit is arbi\ntrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d Marquez v. Screen\nActors, 525 U. S. 33, 44 (1998). This duty extends to \u201cchal\nlenges leveled not only at a union\u2019s contract administra\ntion and enforcement efforts but at its negotiation activi\nties as well.\u201d Beck, 487 U. S., at 743 (citation omitted).\nThus, a union is subject to liability under the NLRA if it\nillegally discriminates against older workers in either the\nformation or governance of the collective-bargaining agree\nment, such as by deciding not to pursue a grievance on\nbehalf of one of its members for discriminatory reasons.\nSee Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, 177 (1967) (describing\nthe duty of fair representation as the \u201cstatutory obligation\nto serve the interests of all members without hostility or\ndiscrimination toward any, to exercise its discretion with\ncomplete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary\nconduct\u201d (emphasis added)). Respondents in fact brought\na fair representation suit against the Union based on its\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Given this avenue that Congress has\nmade available to redress a union\u2019s violation of its duty to\nits members, it is particularly inappropriate to ask this\nCourt to impose an artificial limitation on the collective\nbargaining process.\n   In addition, a union is subject to liability under the\nADEA if the union itself discriminates against its mem\nbers on the basis of age. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7623(d); see also 1\nB. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimina\ntion Law 1575\u20131581 (4th ed. 2007) (explaining that a labor\nunion may be held jointly liable with an employer under\nfederal antidiscrimination laws for discriminating in the\nformation of a collective-bargaining agreement, knowingly\nacquiescing in the employer\u2019s discrimination, or inducing\nthe employer to discriminate); cf. Goodman v. Lukens Steel\nCo., 482 U. S. 656, 669 (1987). Union members may also\nfile age-discrimination claims with the EEOC and the\nNational Labor Relations Board, which may then seek\njudicial intervention under this Court\u2019s precedent. See\nEEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U. S. 279, 295\u2013296\n(2002). In sum, Congress has provided remedies for the\nsituation where a labor union is less than vigorous in\ndefense of its members\u2019 claims of discrimination under the\nADEA.\n                            III\n  Finally, respondents offer a series of arguments con\ntending that the particular CBA at issue here does not\nclearly and unmistakably require them to arbitrate their\nADEA claims. See Brief for Respondents 44\u201347. But\nrespondents did not raise these contract-based arguments\nin the District Court or the Court of Appeals. To the\ncontrary, respondents acknowledged on appeal that the\nCBA provision requiring arbitration of their federal anti\ndiscrimination statutory claims \u201cis sufficiently explicit\u201d in\n24              14 PENN PLAZA LLC v.

In light of\nrespondents\u2019 litigating position, both lower courts assumed\nthat the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause clearly applied to re\nspondents and proceeded to decide the question left unre\nsolved in Wright.

Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 468\u2013469, n. 12 (1983)).\nThis is not an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d As a result, we find that\nrespondents\u2019 alternative arguments for affirmance have\nbeen forfeited. See, e.g., Rita v. United States, 551 U. S.\n338, 360 (2007); Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S.\n51, 56, n. 4 (2002). We will not resurrect them on respon\ndents\u2019 behalf.\n   Respondents also argue that the CBA operates as a\nsubstantive waiver of their ADEA rights because it not\nonly precludes a federal lawsuit, but also allows the Union\nto block arbitration of these claims.

My concern regarding the Court\u2019s\nsubversion of precedent to the policy favoring arbitration\nprompts these additional remarks.\n   Notwithstanding the absence of change in any relevant\nstatutory provision, the Court has recently retreated from,\nand in some cases reversed, prior decisions based on its\nchanged view of the merits of arbitration. Previously, the\nCourt approached with caution questions involving a\nunion\u2019s waiver of an employee\u2019s right to raise statutory\nclaims in a federal judicial forum. After searching the text\nand purposes of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nthe Court in Gardner-Denver held that a clause of a collec\ntive-bargaining agreement (CBA) requiring arbitration of\ndiscrimination claims could not waive an employee\u2019s right\nto a judicial forum for statutory claims. See 415 U. S., at\n51. The Court\u2019s decision rested on several features of the\nstatute, including the individual nature of the rights it\nconfers, the broad remedial powers it grants federal\ncourts, and its expressed preference for overlapping reme\ndies. See id., at 44\u201348. The Court also noted the problem\nof entrusting a union with certain arbitration decisions\n2               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ngiven the potential conflict between the collective interest\nand the interests of an individual employee seeking to\nassert his rights. See id., at 58, n. 19. That concern later\nprovided a basis for our decisions in Barrentine v. Arkan\nsas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 742 (1981),\nand McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284, 291 (1984),\nwhich similarly held that a CBA may not commit enforce\nment of certain rights-creating statutes exclusively to a\nunion-controlled arbitration process. Congress has taken\nno action signaling disagreement with those decisions.\n   The statutes construed by the Court in the foregoing\ncases and in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U. S. 427 (1953), have not\nsince been amended in any relevant respect. But the\nCourt has in a number of cases replaced our predecessors\u2019\nstatutory analysis with judicial reasoning espousing a\npolicy favoring arbitration and thereby reached divergent\nresults. I dissented in those cases to express concern that\nmy colleagues were making policy choices not made by\nCongress. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-\nPlymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 640 (1985); Rodriguez de\nQuijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477,\n486 (1989); Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500\nU. S. 20, 36 (1991); and Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams,\n532 U. S. 105, 124 (2001).\n   Today the majority\u2019s preference for arbitration again\nleads it to disregard our precedent. Although it purports\nto ascertain the relationship between the Age Discrimina\ntion in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), the National\nLabor Relations Act, and the Federal Arbitration Act, the\nCourt ignores our earlier determination of the relevant\nprovisions\u2019 meaning. The Court concludes that \u201c[i]t was\nCongress\u2019 verdict that the benefits of organized labor\noutweigh the sacrifice of individual liberty\u201d that the sys\ntem of organized labor \u201cnecessarily demands,\u201d even when\nthe sacrifice demanded is a judicial forum for asserting an\nindividual statutory right. Ante, at 22. But in Gard\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nner-Denver we determined that \u201cCongress\u2019 verdict\u201d was\notherwise when we held that Title VII does not permit a\nCBA to waive an employee\u2019s right to a federal judicial\nforum. Because the purposes and relevant provisions of\nTitle VII and the ADEA are not meaningfully distinguish\nable, it is only by reexamining the statutory questions\nresolved in Gardner-Denver through the lens of the policy\nfavoring arbitration that the majority now reaches a dif\nferent result.*\n  Under the circumstances, I believe a passage from one\nof my earlier dissents merits repetition. The Court in\nRodriguez de Quijas overruled our decision in Wilko and\nheld that predispute agreements to arbitrate claims under\nthe Securities Act of 1933 are enforceable. 490 U. S., at\n484; see also id., at 481 (noting Wilko\u2019s reliance on \u201cthe\noutmoded presumption of disfavoring arbitration proceed\nings\u201d). I observed in dissent:\n       \u201cIn the final analysis, a Justice\u2019s vote in a case like\n     this depends more on his or her views about the re\n     spective lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and\n     this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges\n     who have confidence in their own ability to fashion\n     public policy are less hesitant to change the law than\n     those of us who are inclined to give wide latitude to\n     the views of the voters\u2019 representatives on nonconsti\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Referring to the potential conflict between individual and collective\ninterests, the Court asserts that it \u201ccannot rely on this judicial policy\nconcern as a source of authority for introducing a qualification into the\nADEA that is not found in its text.\u201d Ante, at 21. That potential conflict\nof interests, however, was a basis for our decision in several pertinent\ncases, including Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974),\nand Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 35 (1991),\nand in the intervening years Congress has not seen fit to correct that\ninterpretation. The Court\u2019s derision of that \u201cpolicy concern\u201d is particu\nlarly disingenuous given its subversion of Gardner-Denver\u2019s holding in\nthe service of an extratextual policy favoring arbitration.\n4               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n    tutional matters. Cf. Boyle v. United Technologies\n    Corp., 487 U. S. 500 (1988). As I pointed out years\n    ago, Alberto-Culver Co. v. Scherk, 484 F. 2d 611 (CA7\n    1973) (dissenting opinion), rev\u2019d, 417 U. S. 506 (1974),\n    there are valid policy and textual arguments on both\n    sides regarding the interrelation of federal securities\n    and arbitration Acts. None of these arguments, how\n    ever, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance be\n    tween judicial and legislative authority and overturn\n    an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been\n    settled for many years.\u201d Rodriguez de Quijas, 490\n    U. S., at 487 (footnote and citation omitted).\n   As was true in Rodriguez de Quijas, there are competing\narguments in this case regarding the interaction of the\nrelevant statutory provisions. But the Court in Gardner-\nDenver considered these arguments, including \u201cthe federal\npolicy favoring arbitration of labor disputes,\u201d 415 U. S., at\n59, and held that Congress did not intend to permit the\nresult petitioners seek. In the absence of an intervening\namendment to the relevant statutory language, we are\nbound by that decision. It is for Congress, rather than this\nCourt, to reassess the policy arguments favoring arbitra\ntion and revise the relevant provisions to reflect its views.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

Although Title\nVII, like the ADEA, \u201cdoes not speak expressly to the rela\ntionship between federal courts and the grievance\narbitration machinery of collective-bargaining agree\nments,\u201d 415 U. S., at 47, we unanimously held that \u201cthe\nrights conferred\u201d by Title VII (with no exception for the\nright to a judicial forum) cannot be waived as \u201cpart of the\ncollective bargaining process,\u201d id., at 51. We stressed the\ncontrast between two categories of rights in labor and\nemployment law. There were \u201cstatutory rights related to\ncollective activity,\u201d which \u201care conferred on employees\ncollectively to foster the processes of bargaining[, which]\nproperly may be exercised or relinquished by the union as\ncollective-bargaining agent to obtain economic benefits for\nunion members.\u201d Ibid. But \u201cTitle VII . . . stands on\nplainly different [categorical] ground; it concerns not\nmajoritarian processes, but an individual\u2019s right to equal\nemployment opportunities.\u201d Ibid. Thus, as the Court\npreviously realized, Gardner-Denver imposed a \u201cseemingly\nabsolute prohibition of union waiver of employees\u2019 federal\nforum rights.\u201d Wright v. Universal Maritime Service\nCorp., 525 U. S. 70, 80 (1998).1\n   We supported the judgment with several other lines of\ncomplementary reasoning. First, we explained that anti\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Gardner-Denver also contained some language seemingly prohibit\ning even individual prospective waiver of federal forum rights, see 415\nU. S., at 51\u201352, an issue revisited in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane\nCorp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991), and not disputed here.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ndiscrimination statutes \u201chave long evinced a general\nintent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against\ndiscrimination,\u201d and Title VII\u2019s statutory scheme carried\n\u201cno suggestion . . . that a prior arbitral decision either\nforecloses an individual\u2019s right to sue or divests federal\ncourts of jurisdiction.\u201d Gardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 47.\nWe accordingly concluded that \u201can individual does not\nforfeit his private cause of action if he first pursues his\ngrievance to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination\nclause of a collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d Id., at 49.\n   Second, we rejected the District Court\u2019s view that simply\nparticipating in the arbitration amounted to electing the\narbitration remedy and waiving the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue.\nWe said that the arbitration agreement at issue covered\nonly a contractual right under the CBA to be free from\ndiscrimination, not the \u201cindependent statutory rights\naccorded by Congress\u201d in Title VII. Id., at 49\u201350. Third,\nwe rebuffed the employer\u2019s argument that federal courts\nshould defer to arbitral rulings. We declined to make the\n\u201cassumption that arbitral processes are commensurate\nwith judicial processes,\u201d id., at 56, and described arbitra\ntion as \u201ca less appropriate forum for final resolution of\nTitle VII issues than the federal courts,\u201d id., at 58.\n   Finally, we took note that \u201c[i]n arbitration, as in the\ncollective bargaining process, the interests of the individ\nual employee may be subordinated to the collective inter\nests of all employees in the bargaining unit,\u201d ibid., n. 19, a\nresult we deemed unacceptable when it came to Title VII\nclaims. In sum, Gardner-Denver held that an individual\u2019s\nstatutory right of freedom from discrimination and access\nto court for enforcement were beyond a union\u2019s power to\nwaive.\n   Our analysis of Title VII in Gardner-Denver is just as\npertinent to the ADEA in this case. The \u201cinterpretation of\nTitle VII . . . applies with equal force in the context of age\ndiscrimination, for the substantive provisions of the ADEA\n4               14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n\u2018were derived in haec verba from Title VII,\u2019 \u201d and indeed\nneither petitioners nor the Court points to any relevant\ndistinction between the two statutes. Trans World Air\nlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 121 (1985) (quoting\nLorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 584 (1978)); see also\nMcKennon, 513 U. S., at 358 (\u201cThe ADEA and Title VII\nshare common substantive features and also a common\npurpose\u201d). Given the unquestionable applicability of the\nGardner-Denver rule to this ADEA issue, the argument\nthat its precedent be followed in this case of statutory\ninterpretation is equally unquestionable. \u201cPrinciples of\nstare decisis . . . demand respect for precedent whether\njudicial methods of interpretation change or stay the\nsame. Were that not so, those principles would fail to\nachieve the legal stability that they seek and upon which\nthe rule of law depends.\u201d CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries,\n553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 14).           And\n\u201c[c]onsiderations of stare decisis have special force\u201d over\nan issue of statutory interpretation, which is unlike con\nstitutional interpretation owing to the capacity of Con\ngress to alter any reading we adopt simply by amending\nthe statute. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.\n164, 172\u2013173 (1989). Once we have construed a statute,\nstability is the rule, and \u201cwe will not depart from [it]\nwithout some compelling justification.\u201d Hilton v. South\nCarolina Public Railways Comm\u2019n, 502 U. S. 197, 202\n(1991). There is no argument for abandoning precedent\nhere, and Gardner-Denver controls.\n                               II\n  The majority evades the precedent of Gardner-Denver as\nlong as it can simply by ignoring it. The Court never\nmentions the case before concluding that the ADEA and\nthe National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq.,\n\u201cyiel[d] a straightforward answer to the question pre\nsented,\u201d ante, at 10, that is, that unions can bargain away\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

If this were a case of first impression, it would at\nleast be possible to consider that conclusion, but the issue\nis settled and the time is too late by 35 years to make the\nbald assertion that \u201c[n]othing in the law suggests a dis\ntinction between the status of arbitration agreements\nsigned by an individual employee and those agreed to by a\nunion representative.\u201d Ante, at 9. In fact, we recently and\nunanimously said that the principle that \u201cfederal forum\nrights cannot be waived in union-negotiated CBAs even if\nthey can be waived in individually executed contracts . . .\nassuredly finds support in\u201d our case law, Wright, 525\nU. S., at 77, and every Court of Appeals save one has read\nour decisions as holding to this position, Air Line Pilots\nAssn., Int\u2019l v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 199 F. 3d 477, 484\n(CADC 1999) (\u201cWe see a clear rule of law emerging from\nGardner-Denver and Gilmer [v. Interstate/Johnson Lane\nCorp., 500 U. S. 20 (1991)]: . . . an individual may prospec\ntively waive his own statutory right to a judicial forum,\nbut his union may not prospectively waive that right for\nhim. All of the circuits to have considered the meaning of\nGardner-Denver after Gilmer, other than the Fourth, are\nin accord with this view\u201d).\n   Equally at odds with existing law is the majority\u2019s\nstatement that \u201c[t]he decision to fashion a CBA to require\narbitration of employment-discrimination claims is no\ndifferent from the many other decisions made by parties in\ndesigning grievance machinery.\u201d Ante, at 7. That is sim\nply impossible to square with our conclusion in Gardner-\nDenver that \u201cTitle VII . . . stands on plainly different\nground\u201d from \u201cstatutory rights related to collective activ\nity\u201d: \u201cit concerns not majoritarian processes, but an indi\nvidual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities.\u201d 415\nU.

That, however, was merely\none of several reasons given in support of the decision, see\nGardner-Denver, 415 U. S., at 47\u201359, and we raised it to\nexplain why the District Court made a mistake in thinking\nthat the employee lost his Title VII rights by electing to\npursue the contractual arbitration remedy, see id., at 49\u2013\n50. One need only read Gardner-Denver itself to know\nthat it was not at all so narrowly reasoned, and we have\nnoted already how later cases have made this abundantly\nclear. Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,\n450 U. S., at 737, provides further testimony:\n    \u201cNot all disputes between an employee and his em\n    ployer are suited for binding resolution in accordance\n    with the procedures established by collective bargain\n    ing. While courts should defer to an arbitral decision\n    where the employee\u2019s claim is based on rights arising\n    out of a collective-bargaining agreement, different\n    considerations apply where the employee\u2019s claim is\n    based on rights arising out of a statute designed to\n    provide minimum substantive guarantees to individ\n    ual workers.\n      \u201cThese considerations were the basis for our deci\n    sion in [Gardner-Denver].\u201d\nSee also Gilmer, supra, at 35 (\u201cAn important concern\u201d in\nGardner-Denver \u201cwas the tension between collective rep\nresentation and individual statutory rights . . .\u201d).

But Gardner-\nDenver forbade union waiver of employees\u2019 federal forum rights in large\npart because of the importance of such rights and a fear that unions\nwould too easily give them up to benefit the many at the expense of the\nfew, a far less salient concern when only economic interests are at\nstake. See, e.g., Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450\nU. S. 728, 737 (1981).\n  3 There is no comfort for the Court in making the one point on which\n\nwe are in accord, that Gardner-Denver relied in part on what the\nmajority describes as \u201cbroad dicta that was highly critical of the use of\narbitration for the vindication of statutory antidiscrimination rights.\u201d\nAnte, at 15\u201316. I agree that Gardner-Denver\u2019s \u201c \u2018mistrust of the arbitral\nprocess\u2019 . . . has been undermined by our recent arbitration decisions,\u201d\nGilmer, supra, at 34, n. 5 (quoting Shearson/American Express Inc. v.\nMcMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 231 (1987)), but if the statements are \u201cdicta,\u201d\ntheir obsolescence is as irrelevant to Gardner-Denver\u2019s continued\nvitality as their currency was to the case\u2019s holding when it came down;\nin Gardner-Denver itself we acknowledged \u201cthe federal policy favoring\narbitration,\u201d 415 U. S., at 46, n. 6, but nonetheless held that a union\ncould not waive its members\u2019 statutory right to a federal forum in a\nCBA.\n8                  14 PENN PLAZA LLC v. PYETT\n\n                         SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nbargaining process, a union may subordinate the interests\nof an individual employee to the collective interests of all\nemployees in the bargaining unit,\u201d ante, at 20 (citing 415\nU. S., at 58, n. 19), an unacceptable result when it comes\nto \u201can individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportuni\nties,\u201d id., at 51. The majority tries to diminish this reason\ning, and the previously stated holding it supported, by\nmaking the remarkable rejoinder that \u201c[w]e cannot rely on\nthis judicial policy concern as a source of authority for\nintroducing a qualification into the ADEA that is not\nfound in its text.\u201d Ante, at 20.4 It is enough to recall that\nrespondents are not seeking to \u201cintroduc[e] a qualification\ninto\u201d the law; they are justifiably relying on statutory\ninterpretation precedent decades old, never overruled, and\nserially reaffirmed over the years. See, e.g., McDonald v.\nWest Branch, 466 U. S. 284, 291 (1984); Barrentine, supra,\nat 742. With that precedent on the books, it makes no\nsense for the majority to claim that \u201cjudicial policy con\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The majority says it would be \u201cparticularly inappropriate\u201d to con\n\nsider Gardner-Denver\u2019s conflict-of-interest rationale because \u201cCongress\nhas made available\u201d another \u201cavenue\u201d to protect workers against union\ndiscrimination, namely, a duty of fair representation claim. Ante, at 22.\nThis answer misunderstands the law, for unions may decline for a\nvariety of reasons to pursue potentially meritorious discrimination\nclaims without succumbing to a member\u2019s suit for failure of fair repre\nsentation. See, e.g., Barrentine, 450 U. S., at 742 (\u201c[E]ven if the em\nployee\u2019s claim were meritorious, his union might, without breaching its\nduty of fair representation, reasonably and in good faith decide not to\nsupport the claim vigorously in arbitration\u201d). More importantly, we\nhave rejected precisely this argument in the past, making this yet\nanother occasion where the majority ignores precedent. See, e.g., ibid.;\nGardner-Denver, supra, at 58, n. 19 (noting that a duty of fair represen\ntation claim would often \u201cprove difficult to establish\u201d). And we were\nwise to reject it. When the Court construes statutes to allow a union to\neliminate a statutory right to sue in favor of arbitration in which the\nunion cannot represent the employee because it agreed to the em\nployer\u2019s challenged action, it is not very consoling to add that the\nemployee can sue the union for being unfair.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncern[s]\u201d about unions sacrificing individual antidiscrimi\nnation rights should be left to Congress.\n   For that matter, Congress has unsurprisingly under\nstood Gardner-Denver the way we have repeatedly ex\nplained it and has operated on the assumption that a CBA\ncannot waive employees\u2019 rights to a judicial forum to\nenforce antidiscrimination statutes. See, e.g., H. R. Rep.\nNo. 102\u201340, pt. 1, p. 97 (1991) (stating that, \u201cconsistent\nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Title VII in\n[Gardner-Denver],\u201d \u201cany agreement to submit disputed\nissues to arbitration . . . in the context of a collective bar\ngaining agreement . . . does not preclude the affected\nperson from seeking relief under the enforcement provi\nsions of Title VII\u201d). And Congress apparently does not\nshare the Court\u2019s demotion of Gardner-Denver\u2019s holding to\na suspect judicial policy concern: \u201cCongress has had [over]\n30 years in which it could have corrected our decision . . .\nif it disagreed with it, and has chosen not to do so. We\nshould accord weight to this continued acceptance of our\nearlier holding.\u201d Hilton, 502 U. S., at 202; see also Patter\nson, 491 U. S., at 172\u2013173.\n                              III\n   On one level, the majority opinion may have little effect,\nfor it explicitly reserves the question whether a CBA\u2019s\nwaiver of a judicial forum is enforceable when the union\ncontrols access to and presentation of employees\u2019 claims in\narbitration, ante, at 24\u201325, which \u201cis usually the case,\u201d\nMcDonald, supra, at 291. But as a treatment of precedent\nin statutory interpretation, the majority\u2019s opinion cannot\nbe reconciled with the Gardner-Denver Court\u2019s own view of\nits holding, repeated over the years and generally under\nstood, and I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
