Argued December 2, 2008—Decided April 1, 2009*\nPetitioners’ powerplants have “cooling water intake structures” that\n  threaten the environment by squashing against intake screens (“im\n  pingement”) or suctioning into the cooling system (“entrainment”)\n  aquatic organisms from the water sources tapped to cool the plants.\n  Thus, the facilities are subject to regulation under the Clean Water\n  Act, which mandates that “[a]ny standard established pursuant to\n  section 1311 . . . or section 1316 . . . and applicable to a point source\n  shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of\n  cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available\n  for minimizing adverse environmental impact.” 33 U. S. C. §1326(b).\n  Sections 1311 and 1316, in turn, employ a variety of “best technology”\n  standards to regulate effluent discharge into the Nation’s waters.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the\n  §1326(b) regulations at issue after nearly three decades of making\n  the “best technology available” determination on a case-by-case basis.\n  Its “Phase I” regulations govern new cooling water intake structures,\n  while the “Phase II” rules at issue apply to certain large existing fa\n  cilities. In the latter rules, the EPA set “national performance stan\n  dards,” requiring most Phase II facilities to reduce “impingement\n  mortality for [aquatic organisms] by 80 to 95 percent from the calcu\n  lation baseline,” and requiring a subset of facilities to reduce en\n  trainment of such organisms by “60 to 90 percent from [that] base\n  line.” 40 CFR §125.94(b)(1), (2).

The Phase II rules also permit site-specific variances from\n    the national performance standards, provided that the permit-issuing\n    authority imposes remedial measures that yield results “as close as\n    practicable     to     the   applicable    performance     standards.”\n    §125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii). Respondents—environmental groups and vari\n    ous States—challenged the Phase II regulations. Concluding that\n    cost-benefit analysis is impermissible under 33 U. S. C. §1326(b), the\n    Second Circuit found the site-specific cost-benefit variance provision\n    unlawful and remanded the regulations to the EPA for it to clarify\n    whether it had relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national\n    performance standards.\nHeld: The EPA permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the\n national performance standards and in providing for cost-benefit\n variances from those standards as part of the Phase II regulations.\n Pp. 7–16.\n    (a) The EPA’s view that §1326(b)’s “best technology available for\n minimizing adverse environmental impact” standard permits consid\n eration of the technology’s costs and of the relationship between those\n costs and the environmental benefits produced governs if it is a rea\n sonable interpretation of the statute—not necessarily the only possi\n ble interpretation, nor even the interpretation deemed most reason\n able by the courts. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\n Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844. The Second Circuit\n took “best technology” to mean the technology that achieves the\n greatest reduction in adverse environmental impacts at a reasonable\n cost to the industry, but it may also describe the technology that most\n efficiently produces a good, even if it produces a lesser quantity of\n that good than other available technologies. This reading is not pre\n cluded by the phrase “for minimizing adverse environmental impact.”\n Minimizing admits of degree and is not necessarily used to refer ex\n clusively to the “greatest possible reduction.” Other Clean Water Act\n provisions show that when Congress wished to mandate the greatest\n feasible reduction in water pollution, it used plain language, e.g.,\n “elimination of discharges of all pollutants,” §1311(b)(2)(A). Thus,\n §1326(b)’s use of the less ambitious goal of “minimizing adverse envi\n ronmental impact” suggests that the EPA has some discretion to de\n termine the extent of reduction warranted under the circumstances,\n plausibly involving a consideration of the benefits derived from re\n ductions and the costs of achieving them.

S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n     (b) Considering §1326(b)’s text, and comparing it with the text and\n  statutory factors applicable to parallel Clean Water Act provisions,\n  prompts the conclusion that it was well within the bounds of reason\n  able interpretation for the EPA to conclude that cost-benefit analysis\n  is not categorically forbidden. In the Phase II rules the EPA sought\n  only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and benefits, limiting\n  variances from Phase II’s “national performance standards” to cir\n  cumstances where the costs are “significantly greater than the bene\n  fits” of compliance. 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii). In defining “national\n  performance standards” the EPA assumed the application of tech\n  nologies whose benefits approach those estimated for closed-cycle\n  cooling systems at a fraction of the cost. That the EPA has for over\n  thirty years interpreted §1326(b) to permit a comparison of costs and\n  benefits, while not conclusive, also tends to show that its interpreta\n  tion is reasonable and hence a legitimate exercise of its discretion.\n  Even respondents and the Second Circuit ultimately recognize that\n  some comparison of costs and benefits is permitted. The Second Cir\n  cuit held that §1326(b) mandates only those technologies whose costs\n  can be reasonably borne by the industry. But whether it is reason\n  able to bear a particular cost can very well depend on the resulting\n  benefits. Likewise, respondents concede that the EPA need not re\n  quire that industry spend billions to save one more fish. This con\n  cedes the principle, and there is no statutory basis for limiting the\n  comparison of costs and benefits to situations where the benefits are\n  de minimis rather than significantly disproportionate.

S. C. §1326(b). 69\nFed. Reg. 41576 (2004). Respondents—environmental\ngroups and various States1—challenged those regulations,\nand the Second Circuit set them aside.

RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nEPA, 475 F. 3d 83, 99–100 (2007). The issue for our deci\nsion is whether, as the Second Circuit held, the EPA is not\npermitted to use cost-benefit analysis in determining the\ncontent of regulations promulgated under §1326(b).\n                               I\n   Petitioners operate—or represent those who operate—\nlarge powerplants. In the course of generating power,\nthose plants also generate large amounts of heat. To cool\ntheir facilities, petitioners employ “cooling water intake\nstructures” that extract water from nearby water sources.\nThese structures pose various threats to the environment,\nchief among them the squashing against intake screens\n(elegantly called “impingement”) or suction into the cool\ning system (“entrainment”) of aquatic organisms that live\nin the affected water sources. See 69 Fed. Reg. 41586.\nAccordingly, the facilities are subject to regulation under\nthe Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. §1251 et seq., which\nmandates:\n      “Any standard established pursuant to section 1311\n    of this title or section 1316 of this title and applicable\n    to a point source shall require that the location, de\n    sign, construction, and capacity of cooling water in\n    take structures reflect the best technology available\n    for minimizing adverse environmental impact.”\n    §1326(b).\nSections 1311 and 1316, in turn, employ a variety of “best\ntechnology” standards to regulate the discharge of efflu\nents into the Nation’s waters.\n   The §1326(b) regulations at issue here were promul\ngated by the EPA after nearly three decades in which the\ndetermination of the “best technology available for mini\nmizing [cooling water intake structures’] adverse envi\nronmental impact” was made by permit-issuing authori\nties on a case-by-case basis, without benefit of a governing\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

The EPA’s initial attempt at such a regulation\ncame to nought when the Fourth Circuit determined that\nthe agency had failed to adhere to the procedural require\nments of the Administrative Procedure Act. Appalachian\nPower Co. v. Train, 566 F. 2d 451, 457 (1977). The EPA\nwithdrew the regulation, 44 Fed. Reg. 32956 (1979), and\ninstead published “draft guidance” for use in implement\ning §1326(b)’s requirements via site-specific permit deci\nsions under §1342. See EPA, Office of Water Enforcement\nPermits Div., {Draft} Guidance for Evaluating the Adverse\nImpact of Cooling Water Intake Structures on the Aquatic\nEnvironment: Section 316(b) P.

Reg. 41584\n(describing system of case-by-case permits under the draft\nguidance).\n  In 1995, the EPA entered into a consent decree which,\nas subsequently amended, set a multiphase timetable for\nthe EPA to promulgate regulations under §1326(b). See\nRiverkeeper, Inc. v. Whitman, No. 93 Civ. 0314 (AGS),\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1505497</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1 (SDNY, Nov. 27, 2001). In the first\nphase the EPA adopted regulations governing certain new,\nlarge cooling water intake structures. 66 Fed. Reg. 65256\n(2001) (Phase I rules); see 40 CFR §§125.80(a), 125.81(a)\n(2008). Those rules require new facilities with water\nintake flow greater than 10 million gallons per day to,\namong other things, restrict their inflow “to a level com\nmensurate with that which can be attained by a closed\ncycle recirculating cooling water system.”2 §125.84(b)(1).\nNew facilities with water-intake flow between 2 million\n——————\n  2 Closed-cycle cooling systems recirculate the water used to cool the\n\nfacility, and consequently extract less water from the adjacent water\nway, proportionately reducing impingement and entrainment.\nRiverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 358 F. 3d 174, 182, n. 5 (CA2 2004); 69 Fed.\nReg. 41601, and n. 44 (2004).\n4             ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand 10 million gallons per day may alternatively comply\nby, among other things, reducing the volume and velocity\nof water removal to certain levels. §125.84(c). And all\nfacilities may alternatively comply by demonstrating,\namong other things, “that the technologies employed will\nreduce the level of adverse environmental impact . . . to a\ncomparable level” to what would be achieved by using a\nclosed-cycle cooling system. §125.84(d). These regulations\nwere upheld in large part by the Second Circuit in\nRiverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 358 F. 3d 174 (2004).\n   The EPA then adopted the so-called “Phase II” rules at\nissue here.3 69 Fed. Reg. 41576. They apply to existing\nfacilities that are point sources, whose primary activity is\nthe generation and transmission (or sale for transmission)\nof electricity, and whose water-intake flow is more than 50\nmillion gallons of water per day, at least 25 percent of\nwhich is used for cooling purposes. Ibid. Over 500 facili\nties, accounting for approximately 53 percent of the Na\ntion’s electric-power generating capacity, fall within Phase\nII’s ambit. See EPA, Economic and Benefits Analysis for\nthe Final Section 316(b) Phase II Existing Facilities Rule,\nA3–13, Table A3–4 (Feb. 2004), online at http://www.\nepa.gov/waterscience/316b/phase2/econbenefits/final/a3.pdf.\nThose facilities remove on average more than 214 billion\ngallons of water per day, causing impingement and en\ntrainment of over 3.4 billion aquatic organisms per year.\n69 Fed. Reg. 41586.\n   To address those environmental impacts, the EPA set\n“national performance standards,” requiring Phase II\nfacilities (with some exceptions) to reduce “impingement\nmortality for all life stages of fish and shellfish by 80 to 95\n——————\n  3 The EPA has also adopted Phase III rules for facilities not subject to\n\nthe Phase I and Phase II regulations. 71 Fed. Reg. 35006 (2006). A\nchallenge to those regulations is currently before the Fifth Circuit,\nwhere proceedings have been stayed pending disposition of these cases.\nSee ConocoPhillips Co. v. EPA, No. 06–60662.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npercent from the calculation baseline”; a subset of facilities\nmust also reduce entrainment of such aquatic organisms\nby “60 to 90 percent from the calculation baseline.” 40\nCFR §125.94(b)(1), (2); see §125.93 (defining “calculation\nbaseline”). Those targets are based on the environmental\nimprovements achievable through deployment of a mix of\nremedial technologies, 69 Fed. Reg. 41599, which the EPA\ndetermined were “commercially available and economi\ncally practicable,” id., at 41602.\n   In its Phase II rules, however, the EPA expressly de\nclined to mandate adoption of closed-cycle cooling systems\nor equivalent reductions in impingement and entrain\nment, as it had done for new facilities subject to the Phase\nI rules. Id., at 41601. It refused to take that step in part\nbecause of the “generally high costs” of converting existing\nfacilities to closed-cycle operation, and because “other\ntechnologies approach the performance of this option.” Id.,\nat 41605. Thus, while closed-cycle cooling systems could\nreduce impingement and entrainment mortality by up to\n98 percent, id., at 41601, (compared to the Phase II targets\nof 80 to 95 percent impingement reduction), the cost of\nrendering all Phase II facilities closed-cycle-compliant\nwould be approximately $3.5 billion per year, id., at\n41605, nine times the estimated cost of compliance with\nthe Phase II performance standards, id., at 41666. More\nover, Phase II facilities compelled to convert to closed-cycle\ncooling systems “would produce 2.4 percent to 4.0 percent\nless electricity even while burning the same amount of\ncoal,” possibly requiring the construction of “20 additional\n400–MW plants . . . to replace the generating capacity\nlost.” Id., at 41605. The EPA thus concluded that “[a]l\nthough not identical, the ranges of impingement and\nentrainment reduction are similar under both options. . . .\n[Benefits of compliance with the Phase II rules] can ap\nproach those of closed-cycle recirculating at less cost with\nfewer implementation problems.” Id., at 41606.\n6          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The regulations permit the issuance of site-specific\nvariances from the national performance standards if a\nfacility can demonstrate either that the costs of compli\nance are “significantly greater than” the costs considered\nby the agency in setting the standards, 40 CFR\n§125.94(a)(5)(i), or that the costs of compliance “would be\nsignificantly greater than the benefits of complying with\nthe applicable performance standards,” §125.94(a)(5)(ii).\nWhere a variance is warranted, the permit-issuing author\nity must impose remedial measures that yield results “as\nclose as practicable to the applicable performance stan\ndards.” §125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii).\n   Respondents challenged the EPA’s Phase II regulations,\nand the Second Circuit granted their petition for review\nand remanded the regulations to the EPA. The Second\nCircuit identified two ways in which the EPA could per\nmissibly consider costs under 33 U. S. C. §1326(b): (1) in\ndetermining whether the costs of remediation “can be\n‘reasonably borne’ by the industry,” and (2) in determining\nwhich remedial technologies are the most cost-effective,\nthat is, the technologies that reach a specified level of\nbenefit at the lowest cost. 475 F. 3d, at 99–100. See also\nid., at 98, and n. 10. It concluded, however, that cost\nbenefit analysis, which “compares the costs and benefits of\nvarious ends, and chooses the end with the best net bene\nfits,” id., at 98, is impermissible under §1326(b), id., at\n100.\n   The Court of Appeals held the site-specific cost-benefit\nvariance provision to be unlawful. Id., at 114. Finding it\nunclear whether the EPA had relied on cost-benefit analy\nsis in setting the national performance standards, or had\nonly used cost-effectiveness analysis, it remanded to the\nagency for clarification of that point. Id., at 104–105.\n(The remand was also based on other grounds which are\nnot at issue here.) The EPA suspended operation of the\nPhase II rules pending further rulemaking. 72 Fed.

We then granted certiorari limited to the\nfollowing question: “Whether [§1326(b)] . . . authorizes the\n[EPA] to compare costs with benefits in determining ‘the\nbest technology available for minimizing adverse envi\nronmental impact’ at cooling water intake structures.”\n552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                              II\n  In setting the Phase II national performance standards\nand providing for site-specific cost-benefit variances, the\nEPA relied on its view that §1326(b)’s “best technology\navailable” standard permits consideration of the technol\nogy’s costs, 69 Fed. Reg. 41626, and of the relationship\nbetween those costs and the environmental benefits pro\nduced, id., at 41603. That view governs if it is a reason\nable interpretation of the statute—not necessarily the only\npossible interpretation, nor even the interpretation\ndeemed most reasonable by the courts. Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 843–844 (1984).4\n  As we have described, §1326(b) instructs the EPA to set\nstandards for cooling water intake structures that reflect\n“the best technology available for minimizing adverse\nenvironmental impact.” The Second Circuit took that\n\n——————\n   4 The dissent finds it “puzzling” that we invoke this proposition (that\n\na reasonable agency interpretation prevails) at the “outset,” omitting\nthe supposedly prior inquiry of “ ‘whether Congress has directly spoken\nto the precise question at issue.’ ” Post, at 6, n. 5 (opinion of STEVENS,\nJ.) (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842). But surely if Congress has\ndirectly spoken to an issue then any agency interpretation contradict\ning what Congress has said would be unreasonable.\n   What is truly “puzzling” is the dissent’s accompanying charge that\nthe Court’s failure to conduct the Chevron step-one inquiry at the\noutset “reflects [its] reluctance to consider the possibility . . . that\nCongress’ silence may have meant to foreclose cost-benefit analysis.”\nPost, at 6, n. 5. Our discussion of that issue, infra, at 11, speaks for\nitself.\n8          ENTERGY CORP. v.

That is certainly a plausible interpretation of\nthe statute. The “best” technology—that which is “most\nadvantageous,” Webster’s New International Dictionary\n258 (2d ed. 1953)—may well be the one that produces the\nmost of some good, here a reduction in adverse environ\nmental impact. But “best technology” may also describe\nthe technology that most efficiently produces some good.\nIn common parlance one could certainly use the phrase\n“best technology” to refer to that which produces a good at\nthe lowest per-unit cost, even if it produces a lesser quan\ntity of that good than other available technologies.\n   Respondents contend that this latter reading is pre\ncluded by the statute’s use of the phrase “for minimizing\nadverse environmental impact.” Minimizing, they argue,\nmeans reducing to the smallest amount possible, and the\n“best technology available for minimizing adverse envi\nronmental impacts,” must be the economically feasible\ntechnology that achieves the greatest possible reduction in\nenvironmental harm.

But “minimize” is a term that admits of\ndegree and is not necessarily used to refer exclusively to\nthe “greatest possible reduction.” For example, elsewhere\nin the Clean Water Act, Congress declared that the proce\ndures implementing the Act “shall encourage the drastic\nminimization of paperwork and interagency decision\nprocedures.” 33 U. S. C. §1251(f). If respondents’ defini\ntion of the term “minimize” is correct, the statute’s use of\nthe modifier “drastic” is superfluous.\n   Other provisions in the Clean Water Act also suggest\nthe agency’s interpretation. When Congress wished to\nmandate the greatest feasible reduction in water pollution,\nit did so in plain language: The provision governing the\ndischarge of toxic pollutants into the Nation’s waters\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrequires the EPA to set “effluent limitations [which] shall\nrequire the elimination of discharges of all pollutants if\nthe Administrator finds . . . that such elimination is tech\nnologically and economically achievable,” §1311(b)(2)(A)\n(emphasis added).       See also §1316(a)(1) (mandating\n“where practicable, a standard [for new point sources]\npermitting no discharge of pollutants” (emphasis added)).\nSection 1326(b)’s use of the less ambitious goal of “mini\nmizing adverse environmental impact” suggests, we think,\nthat the agency retains some discretion to determine the\nextent of reduction that is warranted under the circum\nstances. That determination could plausibly involve a\nconsideration of the benefits derived from reductions and\nthe costs of achieving them. Cf. 40 CFR §125.83 (defining\n“minimize” for purposes of the Phase I regulations as\n“reduc[ing] to the smallest amount, extent, or degree\nreasonably possible”). It seems to us, therefore, that the\nphrase “best technology available,” even with the added\nspecification “for minimizing adverse environmental im\npact,” does not unambiguously preclude cost-benefit\nanalysis.5\n  Respondents’ alternative (and, alas, also more complex)\nargument rests upon the structure of the Clean Water Act.\nThe Act provided that during its initial implementation\nperiod existing “point sources”—discrete conveyances from\nwhich pollutants are or may be discharged, 33 U. S. C.\n§1362(14)—were subject to “effluent limitations . . . which\nshall require the application of the best practicable control\ntechnology currently available.” §1311(b)(1)(A) (emphasis\n——————\n   5 Respondents concede that the term “available” is ambiguous, as it\n\ncould mean either technologically feasible or economically feasible. But\nany ambiguity in the term “available” is largely irrelevant. Regardless\nof the criteria that render a technology “available,” the EPA would still\nhave to determine which available technology is the “best” one. And as\ndiscussed above, that determination may well involve consideration of\nthe technology’s relative costs and benefits.\n10           ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nadded). (We shall call this the “BPT” test.) Following that\ntransition period, the Act initially mandated adoption, by\nJuly 1, 1983 (later extended to March 31, 1989), of stricter\neffluent limitations requiring “application of the best\navailable technology economically achievable for such\ncategory or class, which will result in reasonable further\nprogress toward the national goal of eliminating the dis\ncharge of all pollutants.” §1311(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added);\nsee EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S. 64,\n69–70 (1980). (We shall call this the “BATEA” test.) Sub\nsequent amendment limited application of this standard to\ntoxic and nonconventional pollutants, and for the remain\nder established a (presumably laxer) test of “best conven\ntional-pollutant control technology.” §1311(b)(2)(E).6 (We\nshall call this “BCT.”) Finally, §1316 subjected certain\ncategories of new point sources to “the greatest degree of\neffluent reduction which the Administrator determines to\nbe achievable through application of the best available\ndemonstrated control technology.” §1316(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded); §1316(b)(1)(B). (We shall call this the “BADT”\ntest.) The provision at issue here, applicable not to efflu\nents but to cooling water intake structures, requires, as we\nhave described, “the best technology available for minimiz\ning adverse environmental impact,” §1326(b) (emphasis\nadded). (We shall call this the “BTA” test.)\n   The first four of these tests are elucidated by statutory\nfactor lists that guide their implementation. To take the\nstandards in (presumed) order of increasing stringency,\nsee Crushed Stone, supra, at 69–70: In applying the BPT\ntest the EPA is instructed to consider, among other fac\ntors, “the total cost of application of technology in relation\n——————\n   6 The statute does not contain a hyphen between the words “conven\n\ntional” and “pollutant.” “Conventional pollutant” is a statutory term,\nhowever, see 33 U. S. C. §1314(a)(4), and it is clear that in\n§1311(b)(2)(E) the adjective modifies “pollutant” rather than “control\ntechnology.” The hyphen makes that clear.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved.”\n§1314(b)(1)(B). In applying the BCT test it is instructed to\nconsider “the reasonableness of the relationship between the\ncosts of attaining a reduction in effluents and the effluent\nreduction benefits derived.”        §1314(b)(4)(B) (emphasis\nadded). And in applying the BATEA and BADT tests the\nEPA is instructed to consider the “cost of achieving such\neffluent reduction.” §§1314(b)(2)(B), 1316(b)(1)(B). There\nis no such elucidating language applicable to the BTA test\nat issue here. To facilitate comparison, the texts of these\nfive tests, the clarifying factors applicable to them, and the\nentities to which they apply are set forth in the Appendix,\ninfra.\n   The Second Circuit, in rejecting the EPA’s use of cost\nbenefit analysis, relied in part on the propositions that (1)\ncost-benefit analysis is precluded under the BATEA and\nBADT tests; and (2) that, insofar as the permissibility of\ncost-benefit analysis is concerned, the BTA test (the one at\nissue here) is to be treated the same as those two. See 475\nF. 3d, at 98. It is not obvious to us that the first of these\npropositions is correct, but we need not pursue that point,\nsince we assuredly do not agree with the second. It is\ncertainly reasonable for the agency to conclude that the\nBTA test need not be interpreted to permit only what\nthose other two tests permit. Its text is not identical to\ntheirs. It has the relatively modest goal of “minimizing\nadverse environmental impact” as compared with the\nBATEA’s goal of “eliminating the discharge of all pollut\nants.” And it is unencumbered by specified statutory\nfactors of the sort provided for those other two tests, which\nomission can reasonably be interpreted to suggest that the\nEPA is accorded greater discretion in determining its\nprecise content.\n   Respondents and the dissent argue that the mere fact\nthat §1326(b) does not expressly authorize cost-benefit\nanalysis for the BTA test, though it does so for two of the\n12          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nother tests, displays an intent to forbid its use. This\nsurely proves too much. For while it is true that two of the\nother tests authorize cost-benefit analysis, it is also true\nthat all four of the other tests expressly authorize some\nconsideration of costs. Thus, if respondents’ and the dis\nsent’s conclusion regarding the import of §1326(b)’s silence\nis correct, it is a fortiori true that the BTA test permits no\nconsideration of cost whatsoever, not even the “cost\neffectiveness” and “feasibility” analysis that the Second\nCircuit approved, see supra, at 6, that the dissent would\napprove, post, at 1–2, and that respondents acknowledge.\nThe inference that respondents and the dissent would\ndraw from the silence is, in any event, implausible, as\n§1326(b) is silent not only with respect to cost-benefit\nanalysis but with respect to all potentially relevant fac\ntors. If silence here implies prohibition, then the EPA\ncould not consider any factors in implementing §1326(b)—\nan obvious logical impossibility. It is eminently reason\nable to conclude that §1326(b)’s silence is meant to convey\nnothing more than a refusal to tie the agency’s hands as to\nwhether cost-benefit analysis should be used, and if so to\nwhat degree.\n   Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, see post, at 3–4,\nour decisions in Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,\nInc., 531 U. S. 457 (2001), and American Textile Mfrs.\nInstitute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490 (1981), do not\nundermine this conclusion. In American Trucking, we\nheld that the text of §109 of the Clean Air Act, “inter\npreted in its statutory and historical context . . . unambi\nguously bars cost considerations” in setting air quality\nstandards under that provision. 531 U. S., at 471. The\nrelevant “statutory context” included other provisions in\nthe Clean Air Act that expressly authorized consideration\nof costs, whereas §109 did not. Id., at 467–468. American\nTrucking thus stands for the rather unremarkable propo\nsition that sometimes statutory silence, when viewed in\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontext, is best interpreted as limiting agency discretion.\nFor the reasons discussed earlier, §1326(b)’s silence cannot\nbear that interpretation.\n  In American Textile, the Court relied in part on a stat\nute’s failure to mention cost-benefit analysis in holding\nthat the relevant agency was not required to engage in\ncost-benefit analysis in setting certain health and safety\nstandards. 452 U. S., at 510–512. But under Chevron,\nthat an agency is not required to do so does not mean that\nan agency is not permitted to do so.\n  This extended consideration of the text of §1326(b), and\ncomparison of that with the text and statutory factors\napplicable to four parallel provisions of the Clean Water\nAct, lead us to the conclusion that it was well within the\nbounds of reasonable interpretation for the EPA to con\nclude that cost-benefit analysis is not categorically forbid\nden. Other arguments may be available to preclude such\na rigorous form of cost-benefit analysis as that which was\nprescribed under the statute’s former BPT standard,\nwhich required weighing “the total cost of application of\ntechnology” against “the . . . benefits to be achieved.” See,\nsupra, at 10. But that question is not before us.\n  In the Phase II requirements challenged here the EPA\nsought only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and\nbenefits. The agency limited variances from the Phase II\n“national performance standards” to circumstances where\nthe costs are “significantly greater than the benefits” of\ncompliance. 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii). In defining the\n“national performance standards” themselves the EPA\nassumed the application of technologies whose benefits\n“approach those estimated” for closed-cycle cooling sys\ntems at a fraction of the cost: $389 million per year, 69\nFed. Reg. 41666, as compared with (1) at least $3.5 billion\nper year to operate compliant closed-cycle cooling systems,\nid., at 41605 (or $1 billion per year to impose similar\nrequirements on a subset of Phase II facilities, id., at\n14         ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n41606), and (2) significant reduction in the energy output\nof the altered facilities, id., at 41605. And finally, EPA’s\nassessment of the relatively meager financial benefits of\nthe Phase II regulations that it adopted—reduced im\npingement and entrainment of 1.4 billion aquatic organ\nisms, id., at 41661, Exh. XII–6, with annualized use\nbenefits of $83 million, id., at 41662, and non-use benefits\nof indeterminate value, id., at 41660–41661—when com\npared to annual costs of $389 million, demonstrates quite\nclearly that the agency did not select the Phase II regula\ntory requirements because their benefits equaled their\ncosts.\n   While not conclusive, it surely tends to show that the\nEPA’s current practice is a reasonable and hence legiti\nmate exercise of its discretion to weigh benefits against\ncosts that the agency has been proceeding in essentially\nthis fashion for over 30 years. See Alaska Dept. of Envi\nronmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U. S. 461, 487 (2004);\nBarnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 219–220 (2002). As\nearly as 1977, the agency determined that, while §1326(b)\ndoes not require cost-benefit analysis, it is also not reason\nable to “interpret Section [1326(b)] as requiring use of\ntechnology whose cost is wholly disproportionate to the\nenvironmental benefit to be gained.” In re Public Service\nCo. of New Hampshire, 1 E. A. D. 332, 340 (1977). See\nalso In re Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp., EPA\nDecision of the General Counsel, NPDES Permits, No. 63,\npp. 371, 381 (July 29, 1977) (“EPA ultimately must dem\nonstrate that the present value of the cumulative annual\ncost of modifications to cooling water intake structures is\nnot wholly out of proportion to the magnitude of the esti\nmated environmental gains”); Seacoast Anti-Pollution\nLeague v. Costle, 597 F. 2d 306, 311 (CA1 1979) (rejecting\nchallenge to an EPA permit decision that was based in\npart on the agency’s determination that further restric\ntions would be “ ‘wholly disproportionate to any environ\nmental benefit’ ”).

In considering\na challenge to the EPA’s rejection of dry cooling systems7\nas the “best technology available” for Phase I facilities the\nSecond Circuit noted that “while it certainly sounds sub\nstantial that dry cooling is 95 percent more effective than\nclosed-cycle cooling, it is undeniably relevant that that\ndifference represents a relatively small improvement over\nclosed-cycle cooling at a very significant cost.”\nRiverkeeper, 358 F. 3d, at 194, n. 22. And in the decision\nbelow rejecting the use of cost-benefit analysis in the\nPhase II regulations, the Second Circuit nonetheless\ninterpreted “best technology available” as mandating only\nthose technologies that can “be reasonably borne by the\nindustry.” 475 F. 3d, at 99. But whether it is “reasonable”\nto bear a particular cost may well depend on the resulting\nbenefits; if the only relevant factor was the feasibility of\nthe costs, their reasonableness would be irrelevant.\n   In the last analysis, even respondents ultimately recog\nnize that some form of cost-benefit analysis is permissible.\nThey acknowledge that the statute’s language is “plainly\nnot so constricted as to require EPA to require industry\npetitioners to spend billions to save one more fish or\nplankton.” Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper, Inc. et al.\n29.

The\nCourt of Appeals’ reliance in part on the agency’s use of\ncost-benefit analysis in invalidating the site-specific cost\nbenefit variance provision, 475 F. 3d, at 114, was therefore\nin error, as was its remand of the national performance\nstandards for clarification of whether cost-benefit analysis\nwas impermissibly used, id., at 104–105. We of course\nexpress no view on the remaining bases for the Second\nCircuit’s remand which did not depend on the permissibil\nity of cost-benefit analysis. See id., at 108, 110, 113, 115,\n117, 120.8 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is re\nversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE  BREYER would remand for the additional reason of what he\nregards as the agency’s inadequate explanation of the change in its\ncriterion for variances—from a relationship of costs to benefits that is\n“ ‘wholly disproportionate’ ” to one that is “ ‘significantly greater.’ ” Post,\nat 7–8 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). That ques\ntion can have no bearing upon whether the EPA can use cost-benefit\nanalysis, which is the only question presented here. It seems to us, in\nany case, that the EPA’s explanation was ample. It explained that the\n“wholly out of proportion” standard was inappropriate for the existing\nfacilities subject to the Phase II rules because those facilities lack “the\ngreater flexibility available to new facilities for selecting the location of\ntheir intakes and installing technologies at lower costs relative to the\ncosts associated with retrofitting existing facilities,” and because\n“economically impracticable impacts on energy prices, production costs,\nand energy production . . . could occur if large numbers of Phase II\nexisting facilities incurred costs that were more than ‘significantly\ngreater’ than but not ‘wholly out of proportion’ to the costs in the EPA’s\nrecord.” 68 Fed.

Ante, at 7–13. None\ntheless the drafting history and legislative history of\nrelated provisions, Pub. L. 92–500, §§301, 304, 86 Stat.\n844, 850, as amended, 33 U. S. C. §§1311, 1314, make\nclear that those who sponsored the legislation intended\nthe law’s text to be read as restricting, though not forbid\nding, the use of cost-benefit comparisons. And I would\napply that text accordingly.\n                            I\n  Section 301 provides that, not later than 1977, effluent\n2          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nlimitations for point sources shall require the application\nof “best practicable control technology,” §301(b)(1)(A), 86\nStat. 845 (emphasis added); and that, not later than 1983\n(later extended to 1989), effluent limitations for categories\nand classes of point sources shall require application of the\n“best available technology economically achievable,”\n§301(b)(2)(A), ibid. (emphasis added). Section 304(b), in\nturn, identifies the factors that the Agency shall take into\naccount in determining (1) “best practicable control tech\nnology” and (2) “best available technology.” 86 Stat. 851\n(emphasis added).\n   With respect to the first, the statute provides that the\nfactors taken into account by the Agency “shall include\nconsideration of the total cost of application of technology\nin relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved\nfrom such application . . . and such other factors as the\nAdministrator deems appropriate.” §304(b)(1)(B), ibid.\nWith respect to the second, the statute says that the\nAgency “shall take into account . . . the cost of achieving\nsuch effluent reduction” and “such other factors as the\nAdministrator deems appropriate.” §304(b)(2)(B), ibid.\n   The drafting history makes clear that the statute re\nflects a compromise. In the House version of the legisla\ntion, the Agency was to consider “the cost and the eco\nnomic, social, and environmental impact of achieving such\neffluent reduction” when determining both “best practica\nble” and “best available” technology. H. R. 11896, 92d\nCong., 2d Sess., §§304(b)(1)(B), (b)(2)(B) (1972) (as re\nported from committee). The House Report explained that\nthe “best available technology” standard was needed—as\nopposed to mandating the elimination of discharge of\npollutants—because “the difference in the cost of 100\npercent elimination of pollutants as compared to the cost\nof removal of 97–99 percent of the pollutants in an effluent\ncan far exceed any reasonable benefit to be achieved. In\nmost cases, the cost of removal of the last few percentage\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\npoints increases expo[n]entially.” H. R. Rep. No. 92–911,\np. 103 (1972).\n    In the Senate version, the Agency was to consider “the\ncost of achieving such effluent reduction” when determin\ning both “best practicable” and “best available” technology.\nS. 2770, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., §§304(b)(1)(B), (b)(2)(B)\n(1971) (as reported from committee). The Senate Report\nexplains that “the technology must be available at a cost\n. . . which the Administrator determines to be reasonable.”\nS. Rep. No. 92–414, p. 52 (1971) (hereinafter S. Rep.). But\nit said nothing about comparing costs and benefits.\n    The final statute reflects a modification of the House’s\nlanguage with respect to “best practicable,” and an adop\ntion of the Senate’s language with respect to “best avail\nable.” S. Conf. Rep. No. 92–1236, pp. 124–125 (1972). The\nfinal statute does not require the Agency to compare costs\nto benefits when determining “best available technology,”\nbut neither does it expressly forbid such a comparison.\n    The strongest evidence in the legislative history sup\nporting the respondents’ position—namely, that Congress\nintended to forbid comparisons of costs and benefits when\ndetermining the “best available technology”—can be found\nin a written discussion of the Act’s provisions distributed\nto the Senate by Senator Edmund Muskie, the Act’s prin\ncipal sponsor, when he submitted the Conference Report\nfor the Senate’s consideration. 118 Cong. Rec. 33693\n(1972). The relevant part of that discussion points out\nthat, as to “best practicable technology,” the statute re\nquires application of a “balancing test between total cost\nand effluent reduction benefits.”       Id., at 33696; see\n§304(b)(1)(B). But as to “best available technology,” it\nstates: “While cost should be a factor in the Administra\ntor’s judgment, no balancing test will be required.” Ibid.;\nsee §304(b)(2)(B). And Senator Muskie’s discussion later\nspeaks of the agency “evaluat[ing] . . . what needs to be\ndone” to eliminate pollutant discharge and “what is\n4           ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nachievable,” both “without regard to cost.” Ibid.\n   As this language suggests, the Act’s sponsors had rea\nsons for minimizing the EPA’s investigation of, and reli\nance upon, cost-benefit comparisons. The preparation of\nformal cost-benefit analyses can take too much time,\nthereby delaying regulation. And the sponsors feared that\nsuch analyses would emphasize easily quantifiable factors\nover more qualitative factors (particularly environmental\nfactors, for example, the value of preserving non\nmarketable species of fish). See S. Rep., at 47. Above all,\nthey hoped that minimizing the use of cost-benefit com\nparisons would force the development of cheaper control\ntechnologies; and doing so, whatever the initial inefficien\ncies, would eventually mean cheaper, more effective\ncleanup. See id., at 50–51.\n   Nonetheless, neither the sponsors’ language nor the\nunderlying rationale requires the Act to be read in a way\nthat would forbid cost-benefit comparisons. Any such\ntotal prohibition would be difficult to enforce, for every\nreal choice requires a decisionmaker to weigh advantages\nagainst disadvantages, and disadvantages can be seen in\nterms of (often quantifiable) costs. Moreover, an absolute\nprohibition would bring about irrational results. As the\nrespondents themselves say, it would make no sense to\nrequire plants to “spend billions to save one more fish or\nplankton.” Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper, Inc., et al.\n29. That is so even if the industry might somehow afford\nthose billions. And it is particularly so in an age of limited\nresources available to deal with grave environmental\nproblems, where too much wasteful expenditure devoted to\none problem may well mean considerably fewer resources\navailable to deal effectively with other (perhaps more\nserious) problems.\n   Thus Senator Muskie used nuanced language, which\none can read as leaving to the Agency a degree of author\nity to make cost-benefit comparisons in a manner that is\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsensitive both to the need for such comparisons and to the\nconcerns that the law’s sponsors expressed. The relevant\nstatement begins by listing various factors that the statute\nrequires the Administrator to take into account when\napplying the phrase “practicable” to “classes and catego\nries.” 118 Cong. Rec. 33696. It states that, when doing so,\nthe Administrator must apply (as the statute specifies) a\n“balancing test between total cost and effluent reduction\nbenefits.” Ibid. At the same time, it seeks to reduce the\nlikelihood that the Administrator will place too much\nweight upon high costs by adding that the balancing test\n“is intended to limit the application of technology only\nwhere the additional degree of effluent reduction is wholly\nout of proportion to the costs of achieving” a “marginal\nlevel of reduction.” Ibid.\n   Senator Muskie’s statement then considers the “differ\nent test” that the statute requires the Administrator to\napply when determining the “ ‘best available’ ” technology.\nIbid. (emphasis added). Under that test, the Administra\ntor “may consider a broader range of technological alterna\ntives.” Ibid. And in determining what is “ ‘best available’\nfor a category or class, the Administrator is expected to\napply the same principles involved in making the deter\nmination of ‘best practicable’ . . . except as to cost-benefit\nanalysis.” Ibid. (emphasis added). That is, “[w]hile cost\nshould be a factor . . . no balancing test will be required.”\nIbid. (emphasis added). Rather, “[t]he Administrator will\nbe bound by a test of reasonableness.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). The statement adds that the “ ‘best available’ ”\nstandard “is intended to reflect the need to press toward\nincreasingly higher levels of control.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). And “the reasonableness of what is ‘economically\nachievable’ should reflect an evaluation of what needs to\nbe done to move toward the elimination of the discharge of\npollutants and what is achievable through the application\nof available technology—without regard to cost.” Ibid.\n6          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n(emphasis added).\n  I believe, as I said, that this language is deliberately\nnuanced. The statement says that where the statute uses\nthe term “best practicable,” the statute requires compari\nsons of costs and benefits; but where the statute uses the\nterm “best available,” such comparisons are not “required.”\nIbid. (emphasis added). Senator Muskie does not say that\nall efforts to compare costs and benefits are forbidden.\n  Moreover, the statement points out that where the\nstatute uses the term “best available,” the Administrator\n“will be bound by a test of reasonableness.” Ibid. (empha\nsis added). It adds that the Administrator should apply\nthis test in a way that reflects its ideal objective, moving\nas closely as is technologically possible to the elimination\nof pollution. It thereby says the Administrator should\nconsider, i.e., take into account, how much pollution would\nstill remain if the best available technology were to be\napplied everywhere—“without regard to cost.” Ibid. It\ndoes not say that the Administrator must set the standard\nbased solely on the result of that determination. (It would\nbe difficult to reconcile the alternative, more absolute\nreading of this language with the Senator’s earlier “test of\nreasonableness.”)\n  I say that one may, not that one must, read Senator\nMuskie’s statement this way. But to read it differently\nwould put the Agency in conflict with the test of reason\nableness by threatening to impose massive costs far in\nexcess of any benefit. For 30 years the EPA has read the\nstatute and its history in this way. The EPA has thought\nthat it would not be “reasonable to interpret Section 316(b)\nas requiring use of technology whose cost is wholly dispro\nportionate to the environmental benefit to be gained.”\nIn re Pub.

Reg. 41661–41662; take account of\nCongress’ technology-forcing objectives; and still prevent\nresults that are absurd or unreasonable in light of extreme\ndisparities between costs and benefits. This approach, in\nmy view, rests upon a “reasonable interpretation” of the\nstatute—legislative history included. Hence it is lawful.\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844 (1984).

We here consider a rule that permits variances\nfrom national standards if a facility demonstrates that its\ncosts would be “significantly greater than the benefits of\ncomplying.” 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii) (2008).

RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n“wholly disproportionate.” Perhaps the EPA does not\nmean to make much of that difference. But if it means the\nnew words to set forth a new and different test, the EPA\nmust adequately explain why it has changed its standard.\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State\nFarm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 42–43\n(1983); National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet, 545 U. S. 967, 981 (2005); Thomas\nJefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 524, n. 3 (1994)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n  I am not convinced the EPA has successfully explained\nthe basis for the change. It has referred to the fact that\nexisting facilities have less flexibility than new facilities\nwith respect to installing new technologies, and it has\npointed to special, energy-related impacts of regulation.\n68 Fed. Reg. 13541 (2003) (proposed rule). But it has not\nexplained why the traditional “wholly disproportionate”\nstandard cannot do the job now, when the EPA has used\nthat standard (for existing facilities and otherwise) with\napparent success in the past. See, e.g., Central Hudson,\nsupra.\n  Consequently, like the majority, I would remand these\ncases to the Court of Appeals. But unlike the majority I\nwould permit that court to remand the cases to the EPA so\nthat the EPA can either apply its traditional “wholly\ndisproportionate” standard or provide an adequately\nreasoned explanation for the change.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

S. C. §1326(b), which governs industrial powerplant\nwater intake structures, provides that the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA or Agency) “shall require” that\nsuch structures “reflect the best technology available for\nminimizing adverse environmental impact.” The EPA has\ninterpreted that mandate to authorize the use of cost\nbenefit analysis in promulgating regulations under\n§316(b). For instance, under the Agency’s interpretation,\ntechnology that would otherwise qualify as the best avail\nable need not be used if its costs are “significantly greater\nthan the benefits” of compliance. 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii)\n(2008).\n2             ENTERGY CORP. v.

Unless costs\nare so high that the best technology is not “available,”\nCongress has decided that they are outweighed by the\nbenefits of minimizing adverse environmental impact.\nSection 316(b) neither expressly nor implicitly authorizes\nthe EPA to use cost-benefit analysis when setting regula\ntory standards; fairly read, it prohibits such use.\n                              I\n   As typically performed by the EPA, cost-benefit analysis\nrequires the Agency to first monetize the costs and bene\nfits of a regulation, balance the results, and then choose\nthe regulation with the greatest net benefits. The process\nis particularly controversial in the environmental context\nin which a regulation’s financial costs are often more\nobvious and easier to quantify than its environmental\nbenefits. And cost-benefit analysis often, if not always,\nyields a result that does not maximize environmental\nprotection.\n   For instance, although the EPA estimated that water\nintake structures kill 3.4 billion fish and shellfish each\nyear,1 see 69 Fed. Reg. 41586, the Agency struggled to\ncalculate the value of the aquatic life that would be pro\n\n——————\n  1 To produce energy, industrial powerplants withdraw billions of\n\ngallons of water daily from our Nation’s waterways.

The fish and shellfish are\nkilled by “impingement” or “entrainment.” Impingement occurs when\naquatic organisms are trapped against the screens and grills of water\nintake structures. Entrainment occurs when these organisms are\ndrawn into the intake structures. See Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 475\nF. 3d 83, 89 (CA2 2007); 69 Fed.

To\ncompensate, the EPA took a shortcut: Instead of monetiz\ning all aquatic life, the Agency counted only those species\nthat are commercially or recreationally harvested, a tiny\nslice (1.8 percent to be precise) of all impacted fish and\nshellfish. This narrow focus in turn skewed the Agency’s\ncalculation of benefits. When the EPA attempted to value\nall aquatic life, the benefits measured $735 million.2 But\nwhen the EPA decided to give zero value to the 98.2 per\ncent of fish not commercially or recreationally harvested,\nthe benefits calculation dropped dramatically—to $83\nmillion. Id., at 41666. The Agency acknowledged that its\nfailure to monetize the other 98.2 percent of affected spe\ncies “ ‘could result in serious misallocation of resources,’ ”\nid., at 41660, because its “comparison of complete costs\nand incomplete benefits does not provide an accurate\npicture of net benefits to society.”3\n   Because benefits can be more accurately monetized in\nsome industries than in others, Congress typically decides\nwhether it is appropriate for an agency to use cost-benefit\nanalysis in crafting regulations.

American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n467–468 (2001).\n  When interpreting statutory silence in the past, we have\nsought guidance from a statute’s other provisions. Evi\ndence that Congress confronted an issue in some parts of a\nstatute, while leaving it unaddressed in others, can dem\nonstrate that Congress meant its silence to be decisive.\nWe concluded as much in American Trucking. In that\ncase, the Court reviewed the EPA’s claim that §109 of the\nClean Air Act (CAA), 42 U. S. C. §7409(a) (2000 ed.), au\nthorized the Agency to consider implementation costs in\nsetting ambient air quality standards. We read §109,\nwhich was silent on the matter, to prohibit Agency reli\nance on cost considerations. After examining other provi\nsions in which Congress had given the Agency authority to\nconsider costs, the Court “refused to find implicit in am\nbiguous sections of the CAA an authorization to consider\ncosts that has elsewhere, and so often, been expressly\ngranted.” 531 U. S., at 467. Studied silence, we thus\nconcluded, can be as much a prohibition as an explicit\n“no.”\n  Further motivating the Court in American Trucking was\nthe fact that incorporating implementation costs into the\nAgency’s calculus risked countermanding Congress’ deci\nsion to protect public health. The cost of implementation,\nwe said, “is both so indirectly related to public health and\nso full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn\nfrom direct health effects that it would surely have been\nexpressly mentioned in [the text] had Congress meant it to\nbe considered.” Id., at 469.\n  American Trucking’s approach should have guided the\nCourt’s reading of §316(b).

Yet the majority fails to\nfollow American Trucking despite that case’s obvious\nrelevance to our inquiry.\n                             II\n   In 1972, Congress amended the CWA to strike a careful\nbalance between the country’s energy demands and its\ndesire to protect the environment. The Act required in\ndustry to adopt increasingly advanced technology capable\nof mitigating its detrimental environmental impact. Not\nall point sources were subject to strict rules at once. Ex\nisting plants were granted time to retrofit with the best\ntechnology while new plants were required to incorporate\nsuch technology as a matter of design. Although Congress\nrealized that technology standards would necessarily put\nsome firms out of business, see EPA v. National Crushed\nStone Assn., 449 U. S. 64, 79 (1980), the statute’s steady\nmarch was toward stricter rules and potentially higher\ncosts.\n   Section §316(b) was an integral part of the statutory\nscheme. The provision instructs that “[a]ny standard\nestablished pursuant to section 1311 of this title or section\n1316 of this title and applicable to a point source shall\nrequire that the location, design, construction, and capac\nity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best tech\nnology available for minimizing adverse environmental\nimpact.”     33 U. S. C. §1326(b) (2006 ed.) (emphasis\nadded).4 The “best technology available,” or “BTA,” stan\n——————\n  4 The two cross-referenced provisions, §§1311 and 1316, also establish\n\n“best technology” standards, the first applicable to existing point\nsources and the second to new facilities.

See ante, at 11–12. The Court assumes that, by\nnot specifying how the EPA is to determine BTA, Congress\nintended to give considerable discretion to the EPA to\ndecide how to proceed. Silence, in the majority’s view,\nrepresents ambiguity and an invitation for the Agency to\ndecide for itself which factors should govern its regulatory\napproach.\n   The appropriate analysis requires full consideration of\nthe CWA’s structure and legislative history to determine\nwhether Congress contemplated cost-benefit analysis and,\nif so, under what circumstances it directed the EPA to\nutilize it. This approach reveals that Congress granted\nthe EPA authority to use cost-benefit analysis in some\ncontexts but not others, and that Congress intend to con\ntrol, not delegate, when cost-benefit analysis should be\nused. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842–843 (1984).5\n——————\nsions in §316(b) merely requires any rule promulgated under those\nprovisions, when applied to a point source with a water intake struc\nture, to incorporate §316(b) standards.\n  5 The majority announces at the outset that the EPA’s reading of the\n\nBTA standard “governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the stat\nute—not necessarily the only possible interpretation, nor even the\ninterpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.” Ante, at 7. This\nobservation is puzzling in light of the commonly understood practice\nthat, as a first step, we ask “whether Congress has directly spoken to\nthe precise question at issue.” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842. Only later, if\nCongress’ intent is not clear, do we consider the reasonableness of the\nagency’s action. Id., at 843.

Passed at the same time as\nthe BTA standard at issue here, the effluent limitation\nstandards imposed increasingly strict technology require\nments on industry. In each effluent limitation provision,\nCongress distinguished its willingness to allow the EPA to\nconsider costs from its willingness to allow the Agency to\nconduct a cost-benefit analysis. And to the extent Con\ngress permitted cost-benefit analysis, its use was intended\nto be temporary and exceptional.\n   The first tier of technology standards applied to existing\nplants—facilities for which retrofitting would be particu\nlarly costly. Congress required these plants to adopt\n“effluent limitations . . . which shall require the applica\ntion of the best practicable control technology currently\navailable.” 33 U. S. C. §1311(b)(1)(A). Because this “best\npracticable,” or “BPT,” standard was meant to ease indus\ntry’s transition to the new technology-based regime, Con\ngress gave BPT two unique features: First, it would be\ntemporary, remaining in effect only until July 1, 1983.6\nSecond, it specified that the EPA was to conduct a cost\nbenefit analysis in setting BPT requirements by consider\ning “the total cost of application of technology in relation\nto the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved from such\napplication.”7     §1314(b)(1)(B).   Permitting cost-benefit\n——————\nsecond step reflects the Court’s reluctance to consider the possibility,\nwhich it later laments is “more complex,” ante, at 9, that Congress’\nsilence may have meant to foreclose cost-benefit analysis.\n   6 Congress later extended the deadline to March 31, 1989.\n   7 Senator Muskie, the Senate sponsor of the legislation, described the\n\ncost-benefit analysis permitted under BPT as decidedly narrow, assert\ning that “[t]he balancing test between total cost and effluent reduction\nbenefits is intended to limit the application of technology only where\nthe additional degree of effluent reduction is wholly out of proportion to\nthe costs of achieving such marginal level of reduction for any class or\n8            ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nanalysis in BPT gave the EPA the ability to cushion the\nnew technology requirement. For a limited time, a tech\nnology with costs that exceeded its benefits would not be\nconsidered “best.”\n   The second tier of technology standards required exist\ning powerplants to adopt the “best available technology\neconomically achievable” to advance “the national goal of\neliminating     the     discharge    of    all   pollutants.”\n§1311(b)(2)(A). In setting this “best available technology,”\nor “BAT,”8 standard, Congress gave the EPA a notably\ndifferent command for deciding what technology would\nqualify as “best”: The EPA was to consider, among other\nfactors, “the cost of achieving such effluent reduction,” but\nCongress did not grant it authority to balance costs with\nthe benefits of stricter regulation. §1314(b)(2)(B). Indeed,\nin Crushed Stone this Court explained that the difference\nbetween BPT and BAT was the existence of cost-benefit\nauthority in the first and the absence of that authority in\nthe second. See 449 U. S., at 71 (“Similar directions are\ngiven the Administrator for determining effluent reduc\ntions attainable from the BAT except that in assessing\nBAT total cost is no longer to be considered in comparison\nto effluent reduction benefits”).\n   The BAT standard’s legislative history strongly supports\nthe view that Congress purposefully withheld cost-benefit\nauthority for this tier of regulation. See ibid., n. 10. The\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate split over the\nrole cost-benefit analysis would play in the BAT provision.\nThe House favored the tool, see H. R. Rep.

The Senate view ultimately\nprevailed in the final legislation, resulting in a BAT stan\ndard that was “not subject to any test of cost in relation to\neffluent reduction benefits or any form of cost/benefit\nanalysis.” 3 Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of\n1977: A Continuation of the Legislative History of the\nFederal Water Pollution Control Act (Committee Print\ncompiled for the Senate Committee on Environment and\nPublic Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95–14,\np. 427 (1978).\n   The third and strictest regulatory tier was reserved for\nnew point sources—facilities that could incorporate tech\nnology improvements into their initial design. These new\nfacilities were required to adopt “the best available dem\nonstrated control technology,” or “BADT,” which Congress\ndescribed as “a standard . . . which reflect[s] the greatest\ndegree of effluent reduction.” §1316(a)(1). In administer\ning BADT, Congress directed the EPA to consider “the cost\nof achieving such effluent reduction.” §1316(b)(1)(B). But\nbecause BADT was meant to be the most stringent stan\ndard of all, Congress made no mention of cost-benefit\nanalysis. Again, the silence was intentional. The House’s\nversion of BADT originally contained an exemption for\npoint sources for which “the economic, social, and envi\nronmental costs bear no reasonable relationship to the\neconomic, social, and environmental benefit to be ob\ntained.” 1 Leg. Hist. 798. That this exemption did not\nappear in the final legislation demonstrates that Congress\nconsidered, and rejected, reliance on cost-benefit analysis\nfor BADT.\n   It is in this light that the BTA standard regulating\nwater intake structures must be viewed. The use of cost\nbenefit analysis was a critical component of the CWA’s\nstructure and a key concern in the legislative process. We\nshould therefore conclude that Congress intended to forbid\ncost-benefit analysis in one provision of the Act in which it\n10            ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nwas silent on the matter when it expressly authorized its\nuse in another.9 See, e.g., Allison Engine Co. v. United\nStates ex rel. Sanders, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at\n7–8); Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(“[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another . . . , it is gener\nally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and pur\nposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). This is particularly true given\nCongress’ decision that cost-benefit analysis would play a\ntemporary and exceptional role in the CWA to help exist\ning plants transition to the Act’s ambitious environmental\nstandards.10 Allowing cost-benefit analysis in the BTA\nstandard, a permanent mandate applicable to all power\nplants, serves no such purpose and instead fundamentally\n——————\n  9 The   Court argues that, if silence in §316(b) signals the prohibition of\ncost-benefit analysis, it must also foreclose the consideration of all\nother potentially relevant discretionary factors in setting BTA stan\ndards. Ante, at 12. This all-or-nothing reasoning rests on the deeply\nflawed assumption that Congress treated cost-benefit analysis as just\none among many factors upon which the EPA could potentially rely to\nestablish BTA. Yet, as explained above, the structure and legislative\nhistory of the CWA demonstrate that Congress viewed cost-benefit\nanalysis with special skepticism and controlled its use accordingly. The\nCourt’s assumption of equivalence is thus plainly incorrect. Properly\nread, Congress’ silence in §316(b) forbids reliance on the cost-benefit\ntool but does not foreclose reliance on all other considerations, such as a\ndetermination whether a technology is so costly that it is not “avail\nable” for industry to adopt.\n   10 In 1977, Congress established an additional technology-based stan\n\ndard, commonly referred to as “best conventional pollutant control\ntechnology,” or “BCT,” to govern conventional pollutants previously\ncovered by the BAT standard. See 33 U. S. C. §1311(b)(2)(E). The BCT\nstandard required the EPA to consider, among other factors, “the\nrelationship between the costs of attaining a reduction in effluents and\nthe effluent reduction benefits derived.” §1314(b)(4)(B). That Congress\nexpressly authorized cost-benefit analysis in BCT further confirms that\nCongress treated cost-benefit analysis as exceptional and reserved for\nitself the authority to decide when it would be used in the Act.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   11\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nweakens the provision’s mandate.11\n  Accordingly, I would hold that the EPA is without au\nthority to perform cost-benefit analysis in setting BTA\nstandards. To the extent the EPA relied on cost-benefit\nanalysis in establishing its BTA regulations,12 that action\nwas contrary to law, for Congress directly foreclosed such\nreliance in the statute itself.13 Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843.\n——————\n   11 The Court attempts to cabin its holding by suggesting that a “rigor\n\nous form of cost-benefit analysis,” such as the form “prescribed under\nthe statute’s former BPT standard,” may not be permitted for setting\nBTA regulations. Ante, at 13. Thus the Court has effectively in\nstructed the Agency that it can perform a cost-benefit analysis so long\nas it does not resemble the kind of cost-benefit analysis Congress\nelsewhere authorized in the CWA. The majority’s suggested limit on\nthe Agency’s discretion can only be read as a concession that cost\nbenefit analysis, as typically performed, may be inconsistent with the\nBTA mandate.\n   12 The “national performance standards” the EPA adopted were\n\nshaped by economic efficiency concerns at the expense of finding the\ntechnology that best minimizes adverse environmental impact. In its\nfinal rulemaking, the Agency declined to require industrial plants to\nadopt closed-cycle cooling technology, which by recirculating cooling\nwater requires less water to be withdrawn and thus fewer aquatic\norganisms to be killed. Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 358 F. 3d 174, 182,\nn. 5 (CA2 2004); 69 Fed. Reg. 41601, and n. 44. This the Agency de\ncided despite its acknowledgment that “closed-cycle, recirculating\ncooling systems . . . can reduce mortality from impingement by up to 98\npercent and entrainment by up to 98 percent.” Id., at 41601. The EPA\ninstead permitted individual plants to resort to a “suite” of options so\nlong as the method used reduced impingement and entrainment by the\nmore modest amount of 80 and 60 percent, respectively. See 40 CFR\n§125.94(b). The Agency also permitted individual plants to obtain a\nsite-specific variance from the national performance standards if they\ncould prove (1) that compliance costs would be “significantly greater\nthan” those the Agency considered when establishing the standards, or\n(2) that compliance costs “would be significantly greater than the\nbenefits of complying with the applicable performance standards,”\n§125.94(a)(5).\n   13 Thus, the Agency’s past reliance on a “wholly disproportionate”\n\nstandard, a mild variant of cost-benefit analysis, is irrelevant.

The Phase II rules also permit site-specific variances from\n    the national performance standards, provided that the permit-issuing\n    authority imposes remedial measures that yield results “as close as\n    practicable     to     the   applicable    performance     standards.”\n    §125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii). Respondents—environmental groups and vari\n    ous States—challenged the Phase II regulations. Concluding that\n    cost-benefit analysis is impermissible under 33 U. S. C. §1326(b), the\n    Second Circuit found the site-specific cost-benefit variance provision\n    unlawful and remanded the regulations to the EPA for it to clarify\n    whether it had relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national\n    performance standards.\nHeld: The EPA permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the\n national performance standards and in providing for cost-benefit\n variances from those standards as part of the Phase II regulations.\n Pp. 7–16.\n    (a) The EPA’s view that §1326(b)’s “best technology available for\n minimizing adverse environmental impact” standard permits consid\n eration of the technology’s costs and of the relationship between those\n costs and the environmental benefits produced governs if it is a rea\n sonable interpretation of the statute—not necessarily the only possi\n ble interpretation, nor even the interpretation deemed most reason\n able by the courts. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\n Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843–844. The Second Circuit\n took “best technology” to mean the technology that achieves the\n greatest reduction in adverse environmental impacts at a reasonable\n cost to the industry, but it may also describe the technology that most\n efficiently produces a good, even if it produces a lesser quantity of\n that good than other available technologies. This reading is not pre\n cluded by the phrase “for minimizing adverse environmental impact.”\n Minimizing admits of degree and is not necessarily used to refer ex\n clusively to the “greatest possible reduction.” Other Clean Water Act\n provisions show that when Congress wished to mandate the greatest\n feasible reduction in water pollution, it used plain language, e.g.,\n “elimination of discharges of all pollutants,” §1311(b)(2)(A). Thus,\n §1326(b)’s use of the less ambitious goal of “minimizing adverse envi\n ronmental impact” suggests that the EPA has some discretion to de\n termine the extent of reduction warranted under the circumstances,\n plausibly involving a consideration of the benefits derived from re\n ductions and the costs of achieving them.

In the Phase II rules the EPA sought\n  only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and benefits, limiting\n  variances from Phase II’s “national performance standards” to cir\n  cumstances where the costs are “significantly greater than the bene\n  fits” of compliance. 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii). In defining “national\n  performance standards” the EPA assumed the application of tech\n  nologies whose benefits approach those estimated for closed-cycle\n  cooling systems at a fraction of the cost. That the EPA has for over\n  thirty years interpreted §1326(b) to permit a comparison of costs and\n  benefits, while not conclusive, also tends to show that its interpreta\n  tion is reasonable and hence a legitimate exercise of its discretion.\n  Even respondents and the Second Circuit ultimately recognize that\n  some comparison of costs and benefits is permitted. The Second Cir\n  cuit held that §1326(b) mandates only those technologies whose costs\n  can be reasonably borne by the industry. But whether it is reason\n  able to bear a particular cost can very well depend on the resulting\n  benefits. Likewise, respondents concede that the EPA need not re\n  quire that industry spend billions to save one more fish. This con\n  cedes the principle, and there is no statutory basis for limiting the\n  comparison of costs and benefits to situations where the benefits are\n  de minimis rather than significantly disproportionate.

The issue for our deci\nsion is whether, as the Second Circuit held, the EPA is not\npermitted to use cost-benefit analysis in determining the\ncontent of regulations promulgated under §1326(b).\n                               I\n   Petitioners operate—or represent those who operate—\nlarge powerplants. In the course of generating power,\nthose plants also generate large amounts of heat. To cool\ntheir facilities, petitioners employ “cooling water intake\nstructures” that extract water from nearby water sources.\nThese structures pose various threats to the environment,\nchief among them the squashing against intake screens\n(elegantly called “impingement”) or suction into the cool\ning system (“entrainment”) of aquatic organisms that live\nin the affected water sources. See 69 Fed. Reg. 41586.\nAccordingly, the facilities are subject to regulation under\nthe Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. §1251 et seq., which\nmandates:\n      “Any standard established pursuant to section 1311\n    of this title or section 1316 of this title and applicable\n    to a point source shall require that the location, de\n    sign, construction, and capacity of cooling water in\n    take structures reflect the best technology available\n    for minimizing adverse environmental impact.”\n    §1326(b).\nSections 1311 and 1316, in turn, employ a variety of “best\ntechnology” standards to regulate the discharge of efflu\nents into the Nation’s waters.\n   The §1326(b) regulations at issue here were promul\ngated by the EPA after nearly three decades in which the\ndetermination of the “best technology available for mini\nmizing [cooling water intake structures’] adverse envi\nronmental impact” was made by permit-issuing authori\nties on a case-by-case basis, without benefit of a governing\n                    Cite as: 556 U.

The EPA’s initial attempt at such a regulation\ncame to nought when the Fourth Circuit determined that\nthe agency had failed to adhere to the procedural require\nments of the Administrative Procedure Act. Appalachian\nPower Co. v. Train, 566 F. 2d 451, 457 (1977). The EPA\nwithdrew the regulation, 44 Fed. Reg. 32956 (1979), and\ninstead published “draft guidance” for use in implement\ning §1326(b)’s requirements via site-specific permit deci\nsions under §1342. See EPA, Office of Water Enforcement\nPermits Div., {Draft} Guidance for Evaluating the Adverse\nImpact of Cooling Water Intake Structures on the Aquatic\nEnvironment: Section 316(b) P. L. 92–500, (May 1, 1977), at\nhttp://www.epa.gov/waterscience/316b/files/1977AEIguid.pdf,\n(all Internet materials as visited Mar. 30, 2009, and avail\nable in Clerk of Court’s case file); 69 Fed. Reg. 41584\n(describing system of case-by-case permits under the draft\nguidance).\n  In 1995, the EPA entered into a consent decree which,\nas subsequently amended, set a multiphase timetable for\nthe EPA to promulgate regulations under §1326(b). See\nRiverkeeper, Inc. v. Whitman, No. 93 Civ. 0314 (AGS),\n2001 WL 1505497, *1 (SDNY, Nov. 27, 2001). In the first\nphase the EPA adopted regulations governing certain new,\nlarge cooling water intake structures. 66 Fed. Reg. 65256\n(2001) (Phase I rules); see 40 CFR §§125.80(a), 125.81(a)\n(2008). Those rules require new facilities with water\nintake flow greater than 10 million gallons per day to,\namong other things, restrict their inflow “to a level com\nmensurate with that which can be attained by a closed\ncycle recirculating cooling water system.”2 §125.84(b)(1).\nNew facilities with water-intake flow between 2 million\n——————\n  2 Closed-cycle cooling systems recirculate the water used to cool the\n\nfacility, and consequently extract less water from the adjacent water\nway, proportionately reducing impingement and entrainment.\nRiverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 358 F. 3d 174, 182, n. 5 (CA2 2004); 69 Fed.\nReg. 41601, and n. 44 (2004).\n4             ENTERGY CORP. v.

And all\nfacilities may alternatively comply by demonstrating,\namong other things, “that the technologies employed will\nreduce the level of adverse environmental impact . . . to a\ncomparable level” to what would be achieved by using a\nclosed-cycle cooling system. §125.84(d). These regulations\nwere upheld in large part by the Second Circuit in\nRiverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 358 F. 3d 174 (2004).\n   The EPA then adopted the so-called “Phase II” rules at\nissue here.3 69 Fed. Reg. 41576. They apply to existing\nfacilities that are point sources, whose primary activity is\nthe generation and transmission (or sale for transmission)\nof electricity, and whose water-intake flow is more than 50\nmillion gallons of water per day, at least 25 percent of\nwhich is used for cooling purposes. Ibid. Over 500 facili\nties, accounting for approximately 53 percent of the Na\ntion’s electric-power generating capacity, fall within Phase\nII’s ambit. See EPA, Economic and Benefits Analysis for\nthe Final Section 316(b) Phase II Existing Facilities Rule,\nA3–13, Table A3–4 (Feb. 2004), online at http://www.\nepa.gov/waterscience/316b/phase2/econbenefits/final/a3.pdf.\nThose facilities remove on average more than 214 billion\ngallons of water per day, causing impingement and en\ntrainment of over 3.4 billion aquatic organisms per year.\n69 Fed. Reg. 41586.\n   To address those environmental impacts, the EPA set\n“national performance standards,” requiring Phase II\nfacilities (with some exceptions) to reduce “impingement\nmortality for all life stages of fish and shellfish by 80 to 95\n——————\n  3 The EPA has also adopted Phase III rules for facilities not subject to\n\nthe Phase I and Phase II regulations. 71 Fed. Reg. 35006 (2006). A\nchallenge to those regulations is currently before the Fifth Circuit,\nwhere proceedings have been stayed pending disposition of these cases.\nSee ConocoPhillips Co. v. EPA, No. 06–60662.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Those targets are based on the environmental\nimprovements achievable through deployment of a mix of\nremedial technologies, 69 Fed. Reg. 41599, which the EPA\ndetermined were “commercially available and economi\ncally practicable,” id., at 41602.\n   In its Phase II rules, however, the EPA expressly de\nclined to mandate adoption of closed-cycle cooling systems\nor equivalent reductions in impingement and entrain\nment, as it had done for new facilities subject to the Phase\nI rules. Id., at 41601. It refused to take that step in part\nbecause of the “generally high costs” of converting existing\nfacilities to closed-cycle operation, and because “other\ntechnologies approach the performance of this option.” Id.,\nat 41605. Thus, while closed-cycle cooling systems could\nreduce impingement and entrainment mortality by up to\n98 percent, id., at 41601, (compared to the Phase II targets\nof 80 to 95 percent impingement reduction), the cost of\nrendering all Phase II facilities closed-cycle-compliant\nwould be approximately $3.5 billion per year, id., at\n41605, nine times the estimated cost of compliance with\nthe Phase II performance standards, id., at 41666. More\nover, Phase II facilities compelled to convert to closed-cycle\ncooling systems “would produce 2.4 percent to 4.0 percent\nless electricity even while burning the same amount of\ncoal,” possibly requiring the construction of “20 additional\n400–MW plants . . . to replace the generating capacity\nlost.” Id., at 41605. The EPA thus concluded that “[a]l\nthough not identical, the ranges of impingement and\nentrainment reduction are similar under both options. . . .\n[Benefits of compliance with the Phase II rules] can ap\nproach those of closed-cycle recirculating at less cost with\nfewer implementation problems.” Id., at 41606.\n6          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The regulations permit the issuance of site-specific\nvariances from the national performance standards if a\nfacility can demonstrate either that the costs of compli\nance are “significantly greater than” the costs considered\nby the agency in setting the standards, 40 CFR\n§125.94(a)(5)(i), or that the costs of compliance “would be\nsignificantly greater than the benefits of complying with\nthe applicable performance standards,” §125.94(a)(5)(ii).\nWhere a variance is warranted, the permit-issuing author\nity must impose remedial measures that yield results “as\nclose as practicable to the applicable performance stan\ndards.” §125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii).\n   Respondents challenged the EPA’s Phase II regulations,\nand the Second Circuit granted their petition for review\nand remanded the regulations to the EPA. The Second\nCircuit identified two ways in which the EPA could per\nmissibly consider costs under 33 U. S. C. §1326(b): (1) in\ndetermining whether the costs of remediation “can be\n‘reasonably borne’ by the industry,” and (2) in determining\nwhich remedial technologies are the most cost-effective,\nthat is, the technologies that reach a specified level of\nbenefit at the lowest cost. 475 F. 3d, at 99–100. See also\nid., at 98, and n. 10. It concluded, however, that cost\nbenefit analysis, which “compares the costs and benefits of\nvarious ends, and chooses the end with the best net bene\nfits,” id., at 98, is impermissible under §1326(b), id., at\n100.\n   The Court of Appeals held the site-specific cost-benefit\nvariance provision to be unlawful. Id., at 114. Finding it\nunclear whether the EPA had relied on cost-benefit analy\nsis in setting the national performance standards, or had\nonly used cost-effectiveness analysis, it remanded to the\nagency for clarification of that point. Id., at 104–105.\n(The remand was also based on other grounds which are\nnot at issue here.) The EPA suspended operation of the\nPhase II rules pending further rulemaking. 72 Fed.

We then granted certiorari limited to the\nfollowing question: “Whether [§1326(b)] . . . authorizes the\n[EPA] to compare costs with benefits in determining ‘the\nbest technology available for minimizing adverse envi\nronmental impact’ at cooling water intake structures.”\n552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                              II\n  In setting the Phase II national performance standards\nand providing for site-specific cost-benefit variances, the\nEPA relied on its view that §1326(b)’s “best technology\navailable” standard permits consideration of the technol\nogy’s costs, 69 Fed. Reg. 41626, and of the relationship\nbetween those costs and the environmental benefits pro\nduced, id., at 41603. That view governs if it is a reason\nable interpretation of the statute—not necessarily the only\npossible interpretation, nor even the interpretation\ndeemed most reasonable by the courts. Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 843–844 (1984).4\n  As we have described, §1326(b) instructs the EPA to set\nstandards for cooling water intake structures that reflect\n“the best technology available for minimizing adverse\nenvironmental impact.” The Second Circuit took that\n\n——————\n   4 The dissent finds it “puzzling” that we invoke this proposition (that\n\na reasonable agency interpretation prevails) at the “outset,” omitting\nthe supposedly prior inquiry of “ ‘whether Congress has directly spoken\nto the precise question at issue.’ ” Post, at 6, n. 5 (opinion of STEVENS,\nJ.) (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842). But surely if Congress has\ndirectly spoken to an issue then any agency interpretation contradict\ning what Congress has said would be unreasonable.\n   What is truly “puzzling” is the dissent’s accompanying charge that\nthe Court’s failure to conduct the Chevron step-one inquiry at the\noutset “reflects [its] reluctance to consider the possibility . . . that\nCongress’ silence may have meant to foreclose cost-benefit analysis.”\nPost, at 6, n. 5. Our discussion of that issue, infra, at 11, speaks for\nitself.\n8          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlanguage to mean the technology that achieves the great\nest reduction in adverse environmental impacts at a cost\nthat can reasonably be borne by the industry. 475 F. 3d,\nat 99–100. That is certainly a plausible interpretation of\nthe statute. The “best” technology—that which is “most\nadvantageous,” Webster’s New International Dictionary\n258 (2d ed. 1953)—may well be the one that produces the\nmost of some good, here a reduction in adverse environ\nmental impact. But “best technology” may also describe\nthe technology that most efficiently produces some good.\nIn common parlance one could certainly use the phrase\n“best technology” to refer to that which produces a good at\nthe lowest per-unit cost, even if it produces a lesser quan\ntity of that good than other available technologies.\n   Respondents contend that this latter reading is pre\ncluded by the statute’s use of the phrase “for minimizing\nadverse environmental impact.” Minimizing, they argue,\nmeans reducing to the smallest amount possible, and the\n“best technology available for minimizing adverse envi\nronmental impacts,” must be the economically feasible\ntechnology that achieves the greatest possible reduction in\nenvironmental harm. Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper,\nInc. et al. 25–26. But “minimize” is a term that admits of\ndegree and is not necessarily used to refer exclusively to\nthe “greatest possible reduction.” For example, elsewhere\nin the Clean Water Act, Congress declared that the proce\ndures implementing the Act “shall encourage the drastic\nminimization of paperwork and interagency decision\nprocedures.” 33 U. S. C. §1251(f). If respondents’ defini\ntion of the term “minimize” is correct, the statute’s use of\nthe modifier “drastic” is superfluous.\n   Other provisions in the Clean Water Act also suggest\nthe agency’s interpretation. When Congress wished to\nmandate the greatest feasible reduction in water pollution,\nit did so in plain language: The provision governing the\ndischarge of toxic pollutants into the Nation’s waters\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

See also §1316(a)(1) (mandating\n“where practicable, a standard [for new point sources]\npermitting no discharge of pollutants” (emphasis added)).\nSection 1326(b)’s use of the less ambitious goal of “mini\nmizing adverse environmental impact” suggests, we think,\nthat the agency retains some discretion to determine the\nextent of reduction that is warranted under the circum\nstances. That determination could plausibly involve a\nconsideration of the benefits derived from reductions and\nthe costs of achieving them. Cf. 40 CFR §125.83 (defining\n“minimize” for purposes of the Phase I regulations as\n“reduc[ing] to the smallest amount, extent, or degree\nreasonably possible”). It seems to us, therefore, that the\nphrase “best technology available,” even with the added\nspecification “for minimizing adverse environmental im\npact,” does not unambiguously preclude cost-benefit\nanalysis.5\n  Respondents’ alternative (and, alas, also more complex)\nargument rests upon the structure of the Clean Water Act.\nThe Act provided that during its initial implementation\nperiod existing “point sources”—discrete conveyances from\nwhich pollutants are or may be discharged, 33 U. S. C.\n§1362(14)—were subject to “effluent limitations . . . which\nshall require the application of the best practicable control\ntechnology currently available.” §1311(b)(1)(A) (emphasis\n——————\n   5 Respondents concede that the term “available” is ambiguous, as it\n\ncould mean either technologically feasible or economically feasible. But\nany ambiguity in the term “available” is largely irrelevant. Regardless\nof the criteria that render a technology “available,” the EPA would still\nhave to determine which available technology is the “best” one. And as\ndiscussed above, that determination may well involve consideration of\nthe technology’s relative costs and benefits.\n10           ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nadded). (We shall call this the “BPT” test.) Following that\ntransition period, the Act initially mandated adoption, by\nJuly 1, 1983 (later extended to March 31, 1989), of stricter\neffluent limitations requiring “application of the best\navailable technology economically achievable for such\ncategory or class, which will result in reasonable further\nprogress toward the national goal of eliminating the dis\ncharge of all pollutants.” §1311(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added);\nsee EPA v. National Crushed Stone Assn., 449 U. S. 64,\n69–70 (1980). (We shall call this the “BATEA” test.) Sub\nsequent amendment limited application of this standard to\ntoxic and nonconventional pollutants, and for the remain\nder established a (presumably laxer) test of “best conven\ntional-pollutant control technology.” §1311(b)(2)(E).6 (We\nshall call this “BCT.”) Finally, §1316 subjected certain\ncategories of new point sources to “the greatest degree of\neffluent reduction which the Administrator determines to\nbe achievable through application of the best available\ndemonstrated control technology.” §1316(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded); §1316(b)(1)(B). (We shall call this the “BADT”\ntest.) The provision at issue here, applicable not to efflu\nents but to cooling water intake structures, requires, as we\nhave described, “the best technology available for minimiz\ning adverse environmental impact,” §1326(b) (emphasis\nadded). (We shall call this the “BTA” test.)\n   The first four of these tests are elucidated by statutory\nfactor lists that guide their implementation. To take the\nstandards in (presumed) order of increasing stringency,\nsee Crushed Stone, supra, at 69–70: In applying the BPT\ntest the EPA is instructed to consider, among other fac\ntors, “the total cost of application of technology in relation\n——————\n   6 The statute does not contain a hyphen between the words “conven\n\ntional” and “pollutant.” “Conventional pollutant” is a statutory term,\nhowever, see 33 U. S. C. §1314(a)(4), and it is clear that in\n§1311(b)(2)(E) the adjective modifies “pollutant” rather than “control\ntechnology.” The hyphen makes that clear.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved.”\n§1314(b)(1)(B). In applying the BCT test it is instructed to\nconsider “the reasonableness of the relationship between the\ncosts of attaining a reduction in effluents and the effluent\nreduction benefits derived.”        §1314(b)(4)(B) (emphasis\nadded). And in applying the BATEA and BADT tests the\nEPA is instructed to consider the “cost of achieving such\neffluent reduction.” §§1314(b)(2)(B), 1316(b)(1)(B). There\nis no such elucidating language applicable to the BTA test\nat issue here. To facilitate comparison, the texts of these\nfive tests, the clarifying factors applicable to them, and the\nentities to which they apply are set forth in the Appendix,\ninfra.\n   The Second Circuit, in rejecting the EPA’s use of cost\nbenefit analysis, relied in part on the propositions that (1)\ncost-benefit analysis is precluded under the BATEA and\nBADT tests; and (2) that, insofar as the permissibility of\ncost-benefit analysis is concerned, the BTA test (the one at\nissue here) is to be treated the same as those two. See 475\nF. 3d, at 98. It is not obvious to us that the first of these\npropositions is correct, but we need not pursue that point,\nsince we assuredly do not agree with the second. It is\ncertainly reasonable for the agency to conclude that the\nBTA test need not be interpreted to permit only what\nthose other two tests permit. Its text is not identical to\ntheirs. It has the relatively modest goal of “minimizing\nadverse environmental impact” as compared with the\nBATEA’s goal of “eliminating the discharge of all pollut\nants.” And it is unencumbered by specified statutory\nfactors of the sort provided for those other two tests, which\nomission can reasonably be interpreted to suggest that the\nEPA is accorded greater discretion in determining its\nprecise content.\n   Respondents and the dissent argue that the mere fact\nthat §1326(b) does not expressly authorize cost-benefit\nanalysis for the BTA test, though it does so for two of the\n12          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nother tests, displays an intent to forbid its use. This\nsurely proves too much. For while it is true that two of the\nother tests authorize cost-benefit analysis, it is also true\nthat all four of the other tests expressly authorize some\nconsideration of costs. Thus, if respondents’ and the dis\nsent’s conclusion regarding the import of §1326(b)’s silence\nis correct, it is a fortiori true that the BTA test permits no\nconsideration of cost whatsoever, not even the “cost\neffectiveness” and “feasibility” analysis that the Second\nCircuit approved, see supra, at 6, that the dissent would\napprove, post, at 1–2, and that respondents acknowledge.\nThe inference that respondents and the dissent would\ndraw from the silence is, in any event, implausible, as\n§1326(b) is silent not only with respect to cost-benefit\nanalysis but with respect to all potentially relevant fac\ntors. If silence here implies prohibition, then the EPA\ncould not consider any factors in implementing §1326(b)—\nan obvious logical impossibility. It is eminently reason\nable to conclude that §1326(b)’s silence is meant to convey\nnothing more than a refusal to tie the agency’s hands as to\nwhether cost-benefit analysis should be used, and if so to\nwhat degree.\n   Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, see post, at 3–4,\nour decisions in Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,\nInc., 531 U. S. 457 (2001), and American Textile Mfrs.\nInstitute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490 (1981), do not\nundermine this conclusion. In American Trucking, we\nheld that the text of §109 of the Clean Air Act, “inter\npreted in its statutory and historical context . . . unambi\nguously bars cost considerations” in setting air quality\nstandards under that provision. 531 U. S., at 471. The\nrelevant “statutory context” included other provisions in\nthe Clean Air Act that expressly authorized consideration\nof costs, whereas §109 did not. Id., at 467–468. American\nTrucking thus stands for the rather unremarkable propo\nsition that sometimes statutory silence, when viewed in\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontext, is best interpreted as limiting agency discretion.\nFor the reasons discussed earlier, §1326(b)’s silence cannot\nbear that interpretation.\n  In American Textile, the Court relied in part on a stat\nute’s failure to mention cost-benefit analysis in holding\nthat the relevant agency was not required to engage in\ncost-benefit analysis in setting certain health and safety\nstandards. 452 U. S., at 510–512. But under Chevron,\nthat an agency is not required to do so does not mean that\nan agency is not permitted to do so.\n  This extended consideration of the text of §1326(b), and\ncomparison of that with the text and statutory factors\napplicable to four parallel provisions of the Clean Water\nAct, lead us to the conclusion that it was well within the\nbounds of reasonable interpretation for the EPA to con\nclude that cost-benefit analysis is not categorically forbid\nden. Other arguments may be available to preclude such\na rigorous form of cost-benefit analysis as that which was\nprescribed under the statute’s former BPT standard,\nwhich required weighing “the total cost of application of\ntechnology” against “the . . . benefits to be achieved.” See,\nsupra, at 10. But that question is not before us.\n  In the Phase II requirements challenged here the EPA\nsought only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and\nbenefits. The agency limited variances from the Phase II\n“national performance standards” to circumstances where\nthe costs are “significantly greater than the benefits” of\ncompliance. 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii). In defining the\n“national performance standards” themselves the EPA\nassumed the application of technologies whose benefits\n“approach those estimated” for closed-cycle cooling sys\ntems at a fraction of the cost: $389 million per year, 69\nFed. Reg. 41666, as compared with (1) at least $3.5 billion\nper year to operate compliant closed-cycle cooling systems,\nid., at 41605 (or $1 billion per year to impose similar\nrequirements on a subset of Phase II facilities, id., at\n14         ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n41606), and (2) significant reduction in the energy output\nof the altered facilities, id., at 41605. And finally, EPA’s\nassessment of the relatively meager financial benefits of\nthe Phase II regulations that it adopted—reduced im\npingement and entrainment of 1.4 billion aquatic organ\nisms, id., at 41661, Exh. XII–6, with annualized use\nbenefits of $83 million, id., at 41662, and non-use benefits\nof indeterminate value, id., at 41660–41661—when com\npared to annual costs of $389 million, demonstrates quite\nclearly that the agency did not select the Phase II regula\ntory requirements because their benefits equaled their\ncosts.\n   While not conclusive, it surely tends to show that the\nEPA’s current practice is a reasonable and hence legiti\nmate exercise of its discretion to weigh benefits against\ncosts that the agency has been proceeding in essentially\nthis fashion for over 30 years. See Alaska Dept. of Envi\nronmental Conservation v. EPA, 540 U. S. 461, 487 (2004);\nBarnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 219–220 (2002). As\nearly as 1977, the agency determined that, while §1326(b)\ndoes not require cost-benefit analysis, it is also not reason\nable to “interpret Section [1326(b)] as requiring use of\ntechnology whose cost is wholly disproportionate to the\nenvironmental benefit to be gained.” In re Public Service\nCo. of New Hampshire, 1 E.

In considering\na challenge to the EPA’s rejection of dry cooling systems7\nas the “best technology available” for Phase I facilities the\nSecond Circuit noted that “while it certainly sounds sub\nstantial that dry cooling is 95 percent more effective than\nclosed-cycle cooling, it is undeniably relevant that that\ndifference represents a relatively small improvement over\nclosed-cycle cooling at a very significant cost.”\nRiverkeeper, 358 F. 3d, at 194, n. 22. And in the decision\nbelow rejecting the use of cost-benefit analysis in the\nPhase II regulations, the Second Circuit nonetheless\ninterpreted “best technology available” as mandating only\nthose technologies that can “be reasonably borne by the\nindustry.” 475 F. 3d, at 99. But whether it is “reasonable”\nto bear a particular cost may well depend on the resulting\nbenefits; if the only relevant factor was the feasibility of\nthe costs, their reasonableness would be irrelevant.\n   In the last analysis, even respondents ultimately recog\nnize that some form of cost-benefit analysis is permissible.\nThey acknowledge that the statute’s language is “plainly\nnot so constricted as to require EPA to require industry\npetitioners to spend billions to save one more fish or\nplankton.” Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper, Inc. et al.\n29. This concedes the principle—the permissibility of at\nleast some cost-benefit analysis—and we see no statutory\nbasis for limiting its use to situations where the benefits\n\n——————\n  7 Dry cooling systems use air drafts to remove heat, and accordingly\n\nremove little or no water from surrounding water sources.

The\nCourt of Appeals’ reliance in part on the agency’s use of\ncost-benefit analysis in invalidating the site-specific cost\nbenefit variance provision, 475 F. 3d, at 114, was therefore\nin error, as was its remand of the national performance\nstandards for clarification of whether cost-benefit analysis\nwas impermissibly used, id., at 104–105. We of course\nexpress no view on the remaining bases for the Second\nCircuit’s remand which did not depend on the permissibil\nity of cost-benefit analysis. See id., at 108, 110, 113, 115,\n117, 120.8 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is re\nversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceed\nings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE  BREYER would remand for the additional reason of what he\nregards as the agency’s inadequate explanation of the change in its\ncriterion for variances—from a relationship of costs to benefits that is\n“ ‘wholly disproportionate’ ” to one that is “ ‘significantly greater.’ ” Post,\nat 7–8 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). That ques\ntion can have no bearing upon whether the EPA can use cost-benefit\nanalysis, which is the only question presented here. It seems to us, in\nany case, that the EPA’s explanation was ample. It explained that the\n“wholly out of proportion” standard was inappropriate for the existing\nfacilities subject to the Phase II rules because those facilities lack “the\ngreater flexibility available to new facilities for selecting the location of\ntheir intakes and installing technologies at lower costs relative to the\ncosts associated with retrofitting existing facilities,” and because\n“economically impracticable impacts on energy prices, production costs,\nand energy production . . . could occur if large numbers of Phase II\nexisting facilities incurred costs that were more than ‘significantly\ngreater’ than but not ‘wholly out of proportion’ to the costs in the EPA’s\nrecord.” 68 Fed.

Ante, at 7–13. None\ntheless the drafting history and legislative history of\nrelated provisions, Pub. L. 92–500, §§301, 304, 86 Stat.\n844, 850, as amended, 33 U. S. C. §§1311, 1314, make\nclear that those who sponsored the legislation intended\nthe law’s text to be read as restricting, though not forbid\nding, the use of cost-benefit comparisons. And I would\napply that text accordingly.\n                            I\n  Section 301 provides that, not later than 1977, effluent\n2          ENTERGY CORP. v.

(emphasis added). Section 304(b), in\nturn, identifies the factors that the Agency shall take into\naccount in determining (1) “best practicable control tech\nnology” and (2) “best available technology.” 86 Stat. 851\n(emphasis added).\n   With respect to the first, the statute provides that the\nfactors taken into account by the Agency “shall include\nconsideration of the total cost of application of technology\nin relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved\nfrom such application . . . and such other factors as the\nAdministrator deems appropriate.” §304(b)(1)(B), ibid.\nWith respect to the second, the statute says that the\nAgency “shall take into account . . . the cost of achieving\nsuch effluent reduction” and “such other factors as the\nAdministrator deems appropriate.” §304(b)(2)(B), ibid.\n   The drafting history makes clear that the statute re\nflects a compromise. In the House version of the legisla\ntion, the Agency was to consider “the cost and the eco\nnomic, social, and environmental impact of achieving such\neffluent reduction” when determining both “best practica\nble” and “best available” technology. H. R. 11896, 92d\nCong., 2d Sess., §§304(b)(1)(B), (b)(2)(B) (1972) (as re\nported from committee). The House Report explained that\nthe “best available technology” standard was needed—as\nopposed to mandating the elimination of discharge of\npollutants—because “the difference in the cost of 100\npercent elimination of pollutants as compared to the cost\nof removal of 97–99 percent of the pollutants in an effluent\ncan far exceed any reasonable benefit to be achieved. In\nmost cases, the cost of removal of the last few percentage\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\npoints increases expo[n]entially.” H. R. Rep. No. 92–911,\np. 103 (1972).\n    In the Senate version, the Agency was to consider “the\ncost of achieving such effluent reduction” when determin\ning both “best practicable” and “best available” technology.\nS. 2770, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., §§304(b)(1)(B), (b)(2)(B)\n(1971) (as reported from committee). The Senate Report\nexplains that “the technology must be available at a cost\n. . . which the Administrator determines to be reasonable.”\nS. Rep. No. 92–414, p. 52 (1971) (hereinafter S. Rep.). But\nit said nothing about comparing costs and benefits.\n    The final statute reflects a modification of the House’s\nlanguage with respect to “best practicable,” and an adop\ntion of the Senate’s language with respect to “best avail\nable.” S. Conf. Rep. No. 92–1236, pp. 124–125 (1972). The\nfinal statute does not require the Agency to compare costs\nto benefits when determining “best available technology,”\nbut neither does it expressly forbid such a comparison.\n    The strongest evidence in the legislative history sup\nporting the respondents’ position—namely, that Congress\nintended to forbid comparisons of costs and benefits when\ndetermining the “best available technology”—can be found\nin a written discussion of the Act’s provisions distributed\nto the Senate by Senator Edmund Muskie, the Act’s prin\ncipal sponsor, when he submitted the Conference Report\nfor the Senate’s consideration. 118 Cong. Rec. 33693\n(1972). The relevant part of that discussion points out\nthat, as to “best practicable technology,” the statute re\nquires application of a “balancing test between total cost\nand effluent reduction benefits.”       Id., at 33696; see\n§304(b)(1)(B). But as to “best available technology,” it\nstates: “While cost should be a factor in the Administra\ntor’s judgment, no balancing test will be required.” Ibid.;\nsee §304(b)(2)(B). And Senator Muskie’s discussion later\nspeaks of the agency “evaluat[ing] . . . what needs to be\ndone” to eliminate pollutant discharge and “what is\n4           ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nachievable,” both “without regard to cost.” Ibid.\n   As this language suggests, the Act’s sponsors had rea\nsons for minimizing the EPA’s investigation of, and reli\nance upon, cost-benefit comparisons. The preparation of\nformal cost-benefit analyses can take too much time,\nthereby delaying regulation. And the sponsors feared that\nsuch analyses would emphasize easily quantifiable factors\nover more qualitative factors (particularly environmental\nfactors, for example, the value of preserving non\nmarketable species of fish). See S. Rep., at 47. Above all,\nthey hoped that minimizing the use of cost-benefit com\nparisons would force the development of cheaper control\ntechnologies; and doing so, whatever the initial inefficien\ncies, would eventually mean cheaper, more effective\ncleanup. See id., at 50–51.\n   Nonetheless, neither the sponsors’ language nor the\nunderlying rationale requires the Act to be read in a way\nthat would forbid cost-benefit comparisons. Any such\ntotal prohibition would be difficult to enforce, for every\nreal choice requires a decisionmaker to weigh advantages\nagainst disadvantages, and disadvantages can be seen in\nterms of (often quantifiable) costs. Moreover, an absolute\nprohibition would bring about irrational results. As the\nrespondents themselves say, it would make no sense to\nrequire plants to “spend billions to save one more fish or\nplankton.” Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper, Inc., et al.\n29. That is so even if the industry might somehow afford\nthose billions. And it is particularly so in an age of limited\nresources available to deal with grave environmental\nproblems, where too much wasteful expenditure devoted to\none problem may well mean considerably fewer resources\navailable to deal effectively with other (perhaps more\nserious) problems.\n   Thus Senator Muskie used nuanced language, which\none can read as leaving to the Agency a degree of author\nity to make cost-benefit comparisons in a manner that is\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsensitive both to the need for such comparisons and to the\nconcerns that the law’s sponsors expressed. The relevant\nstatement begins by listing various factors that the statute\nrequires the Administrator to take into account when\napplying the phrase “practicable” to “classes and catego\nries.” 118 Cong. Rec. 33696. It states that, when doing so,\nthe Administrator must apply (as the statute specifies) a\n“balancing test between total cost and effluent reduction\nbenefits.” Ibid. At the same time, it seeks to reduce the\nlikelihood that the Administrator will place too much\nweight upon high costs by adding that the balancing test\n“is intended to limit the application of technology only\nwhere the additional degree of effluent reduction is wholly\nout of proportion to the costs of achieving” a “marginal\nlevel of reduction.” Ibid.\n   Senator Muskie’s statement then considers the “differ\nent test” that the statute requires the Administrator to\napply when determining the “ ‘best available’ ” technology.\nIbid. (emphasis added). Under that test, the Administra\ntor “may consider a broader range of technological alterna\ntives.” Ibid. And in determining what is “ ‘best available’\nfor a category or class, the Administrator is expected to\napply the same principles involved in making the deter\nmination of ‘best practicable’ . . . except as to cost-benefit\nanalysis.” Ibid. (emphasis added). That is, “[w]hile cost\nshould be a factor . . . no balancing test will be required.”\nIbid. (emphasis added). Rather, “[t]he Administrator will\nbe bound by a test of reasonableness.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). The statement adds that the “ ‘best available’ ”\nstandard “is intended to reflect the need to press toward\nincreasingly higher levels of control.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). And “the reasonableness of what is ‘economically\nachievable’ should reflect an evaluation of what needs to\nbe done to move toward the elimination of the discharge of\npollutants and what is achievable through the application\nof available technology—without regard to cost.” Ibid.\n6          ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n(emphasis added).\n  I believe, as I said, that this language is deliberately\nnuanced. The statement says that where the statute uses\nthe term “best practicable,” the statute requires compari\nsons of costs and benefits; but where the statute uses the\nterm “best available,” such comparisons are not “required.”\nIbid. (emphasis added). Senator Muskie does not say that\nall efforts to compare costs and benefits are forbidden.\n  Moreover, the statement points out that where the\nstatute uses the term “best available,” the Administrator\n“will be bound by a test of reasonableness.” Ibid. (empha\nsis added). It adds that the Administrator should apply\nthis test in a way that reflects its ideal objective, moving\nas closely as is technologically possible to the elimination\nof pollution. It thereby says the Administrator should\nconsider, i.e., take into account, how much pollution would\nstill remain if the best available technology were to be\napplied everywhere—“without regard to cost.” Ibid. It\ndoes not say that the Administrator must set the standard\nbased solely on the result of that determination. (It would\nbe difficult to reconcile the alternative, more absolute\nreading of this language with the Senator’s earlier “test of\nreasonableness.”)\n  I say that one may, not that one must, read Senator\nMuskie’s statement this way. But to read it differently\nwould put the Agency in conflict with the test of reason\nableness by threatening to impose massive costs far in\nexcess of any benefit. For 30 years the EPA has read the\nstatute and its history in this way. The EPA has thought\nthat it would not be “reasonable to interpret Section 316(b)\nas requiring use of technology whose cost is wholly dispro\nportionate to the environmental benefit to be gained.”\nIn re Pub.

Reg. 41661–41662; take account of\nCongress’ technology-forcing objectives; and still prevent\nresults that are absurd or unreasonable in light of extreme\ndisparities between costs and benefits. This approach, in\nmy view, rests upon a “reasonable interpretation” of the\nstatute—legislative history included. Hence it is lawful.\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v.

We here consider a rule that permits variances\nfrom national standards if a facility demonstrates that its\ncosts would be “significantly greater than the benefits of\ncomplying.” 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii) (2008). The words\n“significantly greater” differ from the words the EPA has\ntraditionally used to describe its standard, namely,\n8          ENTERGY CORP. v.

It has referred to the fact that\nexisting facilities have less flexibility than new facilities\nwith respect to installing new technologies, and it has\npointed to special, energy-related impacts of regulation.\n68 Fed. Reg. 13541 (2003) (proposed rule). But it has not\nexplained why the traditional “wholly disproportionate”\nstandard cannot do the job now, when the EPA has used\nthat standard (for existing facilities and otherwise) with\napparent success in the past. See, e.g., Central Hudson,\nsupra.\n  Consequently, like the majority, I would remand these\ncases to the Court of Appeals. But unlike the majority I\nwould permit that court to remand the cases to the EPA so\nthat the EPA can either apply its traditional “wholly\ndisproportionate” standard or provide an adequately\nreasoned explanation for the change.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

C. §1326(b), which governs industrial powerplant\nwater intake structures, provides that the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA or Agency) “shall require” that\nsuch structures “reflect the best technology available for\nminimizing adverse environmental impact.” The EPA has\ninterpreted that mandate to authorize the use of cost\nbenefit analysis in promulgating regulations under\n§316(b). For instance, under the Agency’s interpretation,\ntechnology that would otherwise qualify as the best avail\nable need not be used if its costs are “significantly greater\nthan the benefits” of compliance. 40 CFR §125.94(a)(5)(ii)\n(2008).\n2             ENTERGY CORP. v.

Unless costs\nare so high that the best technology is not “available,”\nCongress has decided that they are outweighed by the\nbenefits of minimizing adverse environmental impact.\nSection 316(b) neither expressly nor implicitly authorizes\nthe EPA to use cost-benefit analysis when setting regula\ntory standards; fairly read, it prohibits such use.\n                              I\n   As typically performed by the EPA, cost-benefit analysis\nrequires the Agency to first monetize the costs and bene\nfits of a regulation, balance the results, and then choose\nthe regulation with the greatest net benefits. The process\nis particularly controversial in the environmental context\nin which a regulation’s financial costs are often more\nobvious and easier to quantify than its environmental\nbenefits. And cost-benefit analysis often, if not always,\nyields a result that does not maximize environmental\nprotection.\n   For instance, although the EPA estimated that water\nintake structures kill 3.4 billion fish and shellfish each\nyear,1 see 69 Fed. Reg. 41586, the Agency struggled to\ncalculate the value of the aquatic life that would be pro\n\n——————\n  1 To produce energy, industrial powerplants withdraw billions of\n\ngallons of water daily from our Nation’s waterways.

The fish and shellfish are\nkilled by “impingement” or “entrainment.” Impingement occurs when\naquatic organisms are trapped against the screens and grills of water\nintake structures. Entrainment occurs when these organisms are\ndrawn into the intake structures. See Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 475\nF. 3d 83, 89 (CA2 2007); 69 Fed.

To\ncompensate, the EPA took a shortcut: Instead of monetiz\ning all aquatic life, the Agency counted only those species\nthat are commercially or recreationally harvested, a tiny\nslice (1.8 percent to be precise) of all impacted fish and\nshellfish. This narrow focus in turn skewed the Agency’s\ncalculation of benefits. When the EPA attempted to value\nall aquatic life, the benefits measured $735 million.2 But\nwhen the EPA decided to give zero value to the 98.2 per\ncent of fish not commercially or recreationally harvested,\nthe benefits calculation dropped dramatically—to $83\nmillion. Id., at 41666. The Agency acknowledged that its\nfailure to monetize the other 98.2 percent of affected spe\ncies “ ‘could result in serious misallocation of resources,’ ”\nid., at 41660, because its “comparison of complete costs\nand incomplete benefits does not provide an accurate\npicture of net benefits to society.”3\n   Because benefits can be more accurately monetized in\nsome industries than in others, Congress typically decides\nwhether it is appropriate for an agency to use cost-benefit\nanalysis in crafting regulations.

American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457,\n467–468 (2001).\n  When interpreting statutory silence in the past, we have\nsought guidance from a statute’s other provisions. Evi\ndence that Congress confronted an issue in some parts of a\nstatute, while leaving it unaddressed in others, can dem\nonstrate that Congress meant its silence to be decisive.\nWe concluded as much in American Trucking. In that\ncase, the Court reviewed the EPA’s claim that §109 of the\nClean Air Act (CAA), 42 U. S. C. §7409(a) (2000 ed.), au\nthorized the Agency to consider implementation costs in\nsetting ambient air quality standards. We read §109,\nwhich was silent on the matter, to prohibit Agency reli\nance on cost considerations. After examining other provi\nsions in which Congress had given the Agency authority to\nconsider costs, the Court “refused to find implicit in am\nbiguous sections of the CAA an authorization to consider\ncosts that has elsewhere, and so often, been expressly\ngranted.” 531 U. S., at 467. Studied silence, we thus\nconcluded, can be as much a prohibition as an explicit\n“no.”\n  Further motivating the Court in American Trucking was\nthe fact that incorporating implementation costs into the\nAgency’s calculus risked countermanding Congress’ deci\nsion to protect public health. The cost of implementation,\nwe said, “is both so indirectly related to public health and\nso full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn\nfrom direct health effects that it would surely have been\nexpressly mentioned in [the text] had Congress meant it to\nbe considered.” Id., at 469.\n  American Trucking’s approach should have guided the\nCourt’s reading of §316(b).

And the use of\ncost-benefit analysis, like the consideration of implemen\ntation costs in American Trucking, “pad[s]” §316(b)’s\nenvironmental mandate with tangential economic effi\nciency concerns. Id., at 468. Yet the majority fails to\nfollow American Trucking despite that case’s obvious\nrelevance to our inquiry.\n                             II\n   In 1972, Congress amended the CWA to strike a careful\nbalance between the country’s energy demands and its\ndesire to protect the environment. The Act required in\ndustry to adopt increasingly advanced technology capable\nof mitigating its detrimental environmental impact. Not\nall point sources were subject to strict rules at once. Ex\nisting plants were granted time to retrofit with the best\ntechnology while new plants were required to incorporate\nsuch technology as a matter of design. Although Congress\nrealized that technology standards would necessarily put\nsome firms out of business, see EPA v. National Crushed\nStone Assn., 449 U. S. 64, 79 (1980), the statute’s steady\nmarch was toward stricter rules and potentially higher\ncosts.\n   Section §316(b) was an integral part of the statutory\nscheme. The provision instructs that “[a]ny standard\nestablished pursuant to section 1311 of this title or section\n1316 of this title and applicable to a point source shall\nrequire that the location, design, construction, and capac\nity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best tech\nnology available for minimizing adverse environmental\nimpact.”     33 U. S. C. §1326(b) (2006 ed.) (emphasis\nadded).4 The “best technology available,” or “BTA,” stan\n——————\n  4 The two cross-referenced provisions, §§1311 and 1316, also establish\n\n“best technology” standards, the first applicable to existing point\nsources and the second to new facilities.

RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndard delivers a clear command: To minimize the adverse\nenvironmental impact of water intake structures, the\nEPA must require industry to adopt the best technology\navailable.\n   Based largely on the observation that §316(b)’s text\noffers little guidance and therefore delegates some amount\nof gap-filling authority to the EPA, the Court concludes\nthat the Agency has discretion to rely on cost-benefit\nanalysis. See ante, at 11–12. The Court assumes that, by\nnot specifying how the EPA is to determine BTA, Congress\nintended to give considerable discretion to the EPA to\ndecide how to proceed. Silence, in the majority’s view,\nrepresents ambiguity and an invitation for the Agency to\ndecide for itself which factors should govern its regulatory\napproach.\n   The appropriate analysis requires full consideration of\nthe CWA’s structure and legislative history to determine\nwhether Congress contemplated cost-benefit analysis and,\nif so, under what circumstances it directed the EPA to\nutilize it. This approach reveals that Congress granted\nthe EPA authority to use cost-benefit analysis in some\ncontexts but not others, and that Congress intend to con\ntrol, not delegate, when cost-benefit analysis should be\nused.

S. 837, 842–843 (1984).5\n——————\nsions in §316(b) merely requires any rule promulgated under those\nprovisions, when applied to a point source with a water intake struc\nture, to incorporate §316(b) standards.\n  5 The majority announces at the outset that the EPA’s reading of the\n\nBTA standard “governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the stat\nute—not necessarily the only possible interpretation, nor even the\ninterpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.” Ante, at 7. This\nobservation is puzzling in light of the commonly understood practice\nthat, as a first step, we ask “whether Congress has directly spoken to\nthe precise question at issue.” Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842. Only later, if\nCongress’ intent is not clear, do we consider the reasonableness of the\nagency’s action. Id., at 843.

Passed at the same time as\nthe BTA standard at issue here, the effluent limitation\nstandards imposed increasingly strict technology require\nments on industry. In each effluent limitation provision,\nCongress distinguished its willingness to allow the EPA to\nconsider costs from its willingness to allow the Agency to\nconduct a cost-benefit analysis. And to the extent Con\ngress permitted cost-benefit analysis, its use was intended\nto be temporary and exceptional.\n   The first tier of technology standards applied to existing\nplants—facilities for which retrofitting would be particu\nlarly costly. Congress required these plants to adopt\n“effluent limitations . . . which shall require the applica\ntion of the best practicable control technology currently\navailable.” 33 U. S. C. §1311(b)(1)(A). Because this “best\npracticable,” or “BPT,” standard was meant to ease indus\ntry’s transition to the new technology-based regime, Con\ngress gave BPT two unique features: First, it would be\ntemporary, remaining in effect only until July 1, 1983.6\nSecond, it specified that the EPA was to conduct a cost\nbenefit analysis in setting BPT requirements by consider\ning “the total cost of application of technology in relation\nto the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved from such\napplication.”7     §1314(b)(1)(B).   Permitting cost-benefit\n——————\nsecond step reflects the Court’s reluctance to consider the possibility,\nwhich it later laments is “more complex,” ante, at 9, that Congress’\nsilence may have meant to foreclose cost-benefit analysis.\n   6 Congress later extended the deadline to March 31, 1989.\n   7 Senator Muskie, the Senate sponsor of the legislation, described the\n\ncost-benefit analysis permitted under BPT as decidedly narrow, assert\ning that “[t]he balancing test between total cost and effluent reduction\nbenefits is intended to limit the application of technology only where\nthe additional degree of effluent reduction is wholly out of proportion to\nthe costs of achieving such marginal level of reduction for any class or\n8            ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nanalysis in BPT gave the EPA the ability to cushion the\nnew technology requirement. For a limited time, a tech\nnology with costs that exceeded its benefits would not be\nconsidered “best.”\n   The second tier of technology standards required exist\ning powerplants to adopt the “best available technology\neconomically achievable” to advance “the national goal of\neliminating     the     discharge    of    all   pollutants.”\n§1311(b)(2)(A). In setting this “best available technology,”\nor “BAT,”8 standard, Congress gave the EPA a notably\ndifferent command for deciding what technology would\nqualify as “best”: The EPA was to consider, among other\nfactors, “the cost of achieving such effluent reduction,” but\nCongress did not grant it authority to balance costs with\nthe benefits of stricter regulation. §1314(b)(2)(B). Indeed,\nin Crushed Stone this Court explained that the difference\nbetween BPT and BAT was the existence of cost-benefit\nauthority in the first and the absence of that authority in\nthe second. See 449 U. S., at 71 (“Similar directions are\ngiven the Administrator for determining effluent reduc\ntions attainable from the BAT except that in assessing\nBAT total cost is no longer to be considered in comparison\nto effluent reduction benefits”).\n   The BAT standard’s legislative history strongly supports\nthe view that Congress purposefully withheld cost-benefit\nauthority for this tier of regulation. See ibid., n. 10. The\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate split over the\nrole cost-benefit analysis would play in the BAT provision.\nThe House favored the tool, see H. R. Rep.

The Senate view ultimately\nprevailed in the final legislation, resulting in a BAT stan\ndard that was “not subject to any test of cost in relation to\neffluent reduction benefits or any form of cost/benefit\nanalysis.” 3 Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of\n1977: A Continuation of the Legislative History of the\nFederal Water Pollution Control Act (Committee Print\ncompiled for the Senate Committee on Environment and\nPublic Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95–14,\np. 427 (1978).\n   The third and strictest regulatory tier was reserved for\nnew point sources—facilities that could incorporate tech\nnology improvements into their initial design. These new\nfacilities were required to adopt “the best available dem\nonstrated control technology,” or “BADT,” which Congress\ndescribed as “a standard . . . which reflect[s] the greatest\ndegree of effluent reduction.” §1316(a)(1). In administer\ning BADT, Congress directed the EPA to consider “the cost\nof achieving such effluent reduction.” §1316(b)(1)(B). But\nbecause BADT was meant to be the most stringent stan\ndard of all, Congress made no mention of cost-benefit\nanalysis. Again, the silence was intentional. The House’s\nversion of BADT originally contained an exemption for\npoint sources for which “the economic, social, and envi\nronmental costs bear no reasonable relationship to the\neconomic, social, and environmental benefit to be ob\ntained.” 1 Leg. Hist. 798. That this exemption did not\nappear in the final legislation demonstrates that Congress\nconsidered, and rejected, reliance on cost-benefit analysis\nfor BADT.\n   It is in this light that the BTA standard regulating\nwater intake structures must be viewed. The use of cost\nbenefit analysis was a critical component of the CWA’s\nstructure and a key concern in the legislative process. We\nshould therefore conclude that Congress intended to forbid\ncost-benefit analysis in one provision of the Act in which it\n10            ENTERGY CORP. v. RIVERKEEPER, INC.\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nwas silent on the matter when it expressly authorized its\nuse in another.9 See, e.g., Allison Engine Co. v. United\nStates ex rel. Sanders, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at\n7–8); Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(“[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another . . . , it is gener\nally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and pur\nposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). This is particularly true given\nCongress’ decision that cost-benefit analysis would play a\ntemporary and exceptional role in the CWA to help exist\ning plants transition to the Act’s ambitious environmental\nstandards.10 Allowing cost-benefit analysis in the BTA\nstandard, a permanent mandate applicable to all power\nplants, serves no such purpose and instead fundamentally\n——————\n  9 The   Court argues that, if silence in §316(b) signals the prohibition of\ncost-benefit analysis, it must also foreclose the consideration of all\nother potentially relevant discretionary factors in setting BTA stan\ndards. Ante, at 12. This all-or-nothing reasoning rests on the deeply\nflawed assumption that Congress treated cost-benefit analysis as just\none among many factors upon which the EPA could potentially rely to\nestablish BTA. Yet, as explained above, the structure and legislative\nhistory of the CWA demonstrate that Congress viewed cost-benefit\nanalysis with special skepticism and controlled its use accordingly. The\nCourt’s assumption of equivalence is thus plainly incorrect. Properly\nread, Congress’ silence in §316(b) forbids reliance on the cost-benefit\ntool but does not foreclose reliance on all other considerations, such as a\ndetermination whether a technology is so costly that it is not “avail\nable” for industry to adopt.\n   10 In 1977, Congress established an additional technology-based stan\n\ndard, commonly referred to as “best conventional pollutant control\ntechnology,” or “BCT,” to govern conventional pollutants previously\ncovered by the BAT standard. See 33 U. S. C. §1311(b)(2)(E). The BCT\nstandard required the EPA to consider, among other factors, “the\nrelationship between the costs of attaining a reduction in effluents and\nthe effluent reduction benefits derived.” §1314(b)(4)(B). That Congress\nexpressly authorized cost-benefit analysis in BCT further confirms that\nCongress treated cost-benefit analysis as exceptional and reserved for\nitself the authority to decide when it would be used in the Act.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

To the extent the EPA relied on cost-benefit\nanalysis in establishing its BTA regulations,12 that action\nwas contrary to law, for Congress directly foreclosed such\nreliance in the statute itself.13 Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843.\n——————\n   11 The Court attempts to cabin its holding by suggesting that a “rigor\n\nous form of cost-benefit analysis,” such as the form “prescribed under\nthe statute’s former BPT standard,” may not be permitted for setting\nBTA regulations. Ante, at 13. Thus the Court has effectively in\nstructed the Agency that it can perform a cost-benefit analysis so long\nas it does not resemble the kind of cost-benefit analysis Congress\nelsewhere authorized in the CWA. The majority’s suggested limit on\nthe Agency’s discretion can only be read as a concession that cost\nbenefit analysis, as typically performed, may be inconsistent with the\nBTA mandate.\n   12 The “national performance standards” the EPA adopted were\n\nshaped by economic efficiency concerns at the expense of finding the\ntechnology that best minimizes adverse environmental impact. In its\nfinal rulemaking, the Agency declined to require industrial plants to\nadopt closed-cycle cooling technology, which by recirculating cooling\nwater requires less water to be withdrawn and thus fewer aquatic\norganisms to be killed. Riverkeeper, Inc. v. EPA, 358 F. 3d 174, 182,\nn. 5 (CA2 2004); 69 Fed. Reg. 41601, and n. 44. This the Agency de\ncided despite its acknowledgment that “closed-cycle, recirculating\ncooling systems . . . can reduce mortality from impingement by up to 98\npercent and entrainment by up to 98 percent.” Id., at 41601. The EPA\ninstead permitted individual plants to resort to a “suite” of options so\nlong as the method used reduced impingement and entrainment by the\nmore modest amount of 80 and 60 percent, respectively. See 40 CFR\n§125.94(b). The Agency also permitted individual plants to obtain a\nsite-specific variance from the national performance standards if they\ncould prove (1) that compliance costs would be “significantly greater\nthan” those the Agency considered when establishing the standards, or\n(2) that compliance costs “would be significantly greater than the\nbenefits of complying with the applicable performance standards,”\n§125.94(a)(5).\n   13 Thus, the Agency’s past reliance on a “wholly disproportionate”\n\nstandard, a mild variant of cost-benefit analysis, is irrelevant. See\nante, at 14. Because “Congress has directly spoken to the precise\n12            ENTERGY CORP. v.

I would leave it to the Agency to decide how to\nproceed in the first instance.\n                              III\n   Because the Court unsettles the scheme Congress estab\nlished, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nquestion at issue,” Chevron, 467 U.
