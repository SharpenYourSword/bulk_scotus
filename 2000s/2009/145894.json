OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS \n\n                        ET AL. \n\n\n         CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF HAWAII\n\n  No. 07\u20131372. Argued February 25, 2009\u2014Decided March 31, 2009\nAfter the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Congress an\n  nexed the Territory of Hawaii pursuant to the Newlands Resolution,\n  under which Hawaii ceded to the United States the \u201cabsolute fee\u201d and\n  ownership of all public, government, and crown lands. In 1959, the\n  Admission Act made Hawaii a State, granting it \u201call the public lands\n  . . . held by the United States,\u201d \u00a75(b), and requiring these lands, \u201cto\n  gether with the proceeds from [their] sale . . . , [to] be held by [the]\n  State as a public trust,\u201d \u00a75(f). Hawaii state law also authorizes the\n  State to use or sell the ceded lands, provided the proceeds are held in\n  trust for Hawaiian citizens. In 1993, Congress\u2019 joint Apology Resolu\n  tion \u201capologize[d]\u201d for this country\u2019s role in overthrowing the Hawai\n  ian monarchy, \u00a71, and declared that nothing in the resolution was\n  \u201cintended to serve as a settlement of any claims against the United\n  States,\u201d \u00a73.\n      The \u201cLeiali\u2019i parcel,\u201d a Maui tract of former crown land, was ceded\n  to the United States at annexation and has been held by the State\n  since 1959 as part of the Admission Act \u00a75(f) trust. Hawaii\u2019s afford\n  able housing agency (HFDC) received approval to remove the parcel\n  from the trust and redevelop it upon compensating respondent Office\n  of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which manages funds from the use or\n  sale of ceded lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians. After HFDC\n  refused OHA\u2019s demand that the payment include a disclaimer pre\n  serving any native Hawaiian claims to lands transferred from the\n  trust for redevelopment, respondents sued to enjoin the sale or trans\n  fer of the Leiali\u2019i parcel and any other of the ceded lands until final\n  determination of native Hawaiians\u2019 claims. The state trial court en\n  tered judgment against respondents, but the Hawaiian Supreme\n  Court vacated that ruling. Relying on the Apology Resolution, the\n2            HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    court granted the injunction that respondents requested, rejecting\n    petitioners\u2019 argument that the Admission Act and state law give the\n    State explicit power to sell ceded lands.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction. Respondents argue to no avail that\n the case does not raise a federal question because the State Supreme\n Court merely held that the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\n breach of the State\u2019s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians under state\n law. The Court has jurisdiction whenever \u201ca state court decision\n fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven\n with the federal law.\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040. Far\n from providing a plain statement that its decision rested on state\n law, the state court plainly held that the decision was dictated by\n federal law, particularly the Apology Resolution. Pp. 6\u20137.\n    2. The Apology Resolution did not strip Hawaii of its sovereign au\n thority to alienate the lands the United States held in absolute fee\n and granted to the State upon its admission to the Union. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       (a) Neither of the resolution\u2019s substantive provisions justifies the\n judgment below. The first such provision\u2019s six verbs\u2014i.e., Congress\n \u201cacknowledge[d] the historical significance\u201d of the monarchy\u2019s over\n throw, \u201crecognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation\u201d with\n native Hawaiians, \u201capologize[d] to [them]\u201d for the overthrow, \u201cex\n presse[d] [the] commitment to acknowledge [the overthrow\u2019s] ramifi\n cations,\u201d and \u201curge[d] the President . . . to also acknowledge [those]\n ramifications,\u201d \u00a71\u2014are all conciliatory or precatory. This is not the\n kind of language Congress uses to create substantive rights, espe\n cially rights enforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g.,\n Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17\u2013\n 18. The resolution\u2019s second substantive provision, the \u00a73 disclaimer,\n by its terms speaks only to those who may or may not have \u201cclaims\n against the United States.\u201d The State Supreme Court, however, read\n \u00a73 as a congressional recognition\u2014and preservation\u2014of claims\n against Hawaii. There is no justification for turning an express dis\n claimer of claims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\n tion of claims against another. Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the 37 \u201cwhereas\u201d\n clauses prefacing the Apology Resolution clearly recognize native\n Hawaiians\u2019 \u201cunrelinquished\u201d claims over the ceded lands is wrong for\n at least three reasons. First, such \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses cannot bear the\n weight that the lower court placed on them. See, e.g., District of Co\n lumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3. Second, even if the clauses\n had some legal effect, they did not restructure Hawaii\u2019s rights and\n obligations, as the lower court found. \u201c[R]epeals by implication are\n not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the leg\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  islature to repeal [is] clear and manifest.\u201d National Assn. of Home\n  Builders v. Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___. The Apology\n  Resolution reveals no such intention, much less a clear and manifest\n  one. Third, because the resolution would raise grave constitutional\n  concerns if it purported to \u201ccloud\u201d Hawaii\u2019s title to its sovereign lands\n  more than three decades after the State\u2019s admission to the Union,\n  see, e.g., Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9, the Court re\n  fuses to read the nonsubstantive \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses to create such a\n  \u201ccloud\u201d retroactively, see, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381\u2013\n  382.

Pursuant to the Newlands Resolution, the\nRepublic of Hawaii \u201ccede[d] absolutely and without re\nserve to the United States of America all rights of sover\neignty of whatsoever kind\u201d and further \u201ccede[d] and trans\nfer[red] to the United States the absolute fee and\nownership of all public, Government, or Crown lands,\npublic buildings or edifices, ports, harbors, military\nequipment, and all other public property of every kind and\ndescription belonging to the Government of the Hawaiian\nIslands, together with every right and appurtenance\nthereunto appertaining\u201d (hereinafter ceded lands).1 Ibid.\nThe Newlands Resolution further provided that all \u201cprop\nerty and rights\u201d in the ceded lands \u201care vested in the\nUnited States of America.\u201d Ibid.\n  Two years later, Congress established a government for\nthe Territory of Hawaii. See Act of Apr. 30, 1900, ch. 339,\n31 Stat. 141 (hereinafter Organic Act). The Organic Act\nreiterated the Newlands Resolution and made clear that\nthe new Territory consisted of the land that the United\nStates acquired in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d under that resolution.\nSee \u00a72, ibid. The Organic Act further provided:\n    \u201c[T]he portion of the public domain heretofore known\n    as Crown land is hereby declared to have been, on [the\n    effective date of the Newlands Resolution], and prior\n    thereto, the property of the Hawaiian government,\n    and to be free and clear from any trust of or concern\n    ing the same, and from all claim of any nature what\n    soever, upon the rents, issues, and profits thereof.

S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1959, Congress admitted Hawaii to the Union. See\nPub. L. 86\u20133, 73 Stat. 4 (hereinafter Admission Act).\nUnder the Admission Act, with exceptions not relevant\nhere, \u201cthe United States grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii,\neffective upon its admission into the Union, the United\nStates\u2019 title to all the public lands and other public prop\nerty within the boundaries of the State of Hawaii, title to\nwhich is held by the United States immediately prior to its\nadmission into the Union.\u201d \u00a75(b), id., at 5. These lands,\n\u201ctogether with the proceeds from the sale or other disposi\ntion of [these] lands and the income therefrom, shall be\nheld by [the] State as a public trust\u201d to promote various\npublic purposes, including supporting public education,\nbettering conditions of Native Hawaiians, developing\nhome ownership, making public improvements, and pro\nviding lands for public use. \u00a75(f), id., at 6. Hawaii state\nlaw also authorizes the State to use or sell the ceded\nlands, provided that the proceeds are held in trust for the\nbenefit of the citizens of Hawaii. See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7\u00a7171\u201345, 171\u201318 (1993).\n   In 1993, Congress enacted a joint resolution \u201cto ac\nknowledge the historic significance of the illegal overthrow\nof the Kingdom of Hawaii, to express its deep regret to the\nNative Hawaiian people, and to support the reconciliation\nefforts of the State of Hawaii and the United Church of\nChrist with Native Hawaiians.\u201d Joint Resolution to Ac\nknowledge the 100th Anniversary of the January 17, 1893\nOverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Pub. L. 103\u2013150,\n107 Stat. 1510, 1513 (hereinafter Apology Resolution). In\na series of the preambular \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses, Congress\nmade various observations about Hawaii\u2019s history. For\nexample, the Apology Resolution states that \u201cthe indige\nnous Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their\nclaims . . . over their national lands to the United States\u201d\nand that \u201cthe health and well-being of the Native Hawai\nian people is intrinsically tied to their deep feelings and\n4         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattachment to the land.\u201d Id., at 1512. In the same vein,\nthe resolution\u2019s only substantive section\u2014entitled \u201cAc\nknowledgement and Apology\u201d\u2014states that Congress:\n       \u201c(1) . . . acknowledges the historical significance of\n    this event which resulted in the suppression of the in\n    herent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people;\n       \u201c(2) recognizes and commends efforts of reconcilia\n    tion initiated by the State of Hawaii and the United\n    Church of Christ with Native Hawaiians;\n       \u201c(3) apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the\n    people of the United States for the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the par\n    ticipation of agents and citizens of the United States,\n    and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians\n    to self-determination;\n       \u201c(4) expresses its commitment to acknowledge the\n    ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Ha\n    waii, in order to provide a proper foundation for rec\n    onciliation between the United States and the Native\n    Hawaiian people; and\n       \u201c(5) urges the President of the United States to also\n    acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation ef\n    forts between the United States and the Native Ha\n    waiian people.\u201d Id., at 1513.\nFinally, \u00a73 of the Apology Resolution states that \u201cNothing\nin this Joint Resolution is intended to serve as a settle\nment of any claims against the United States.\u201d Id., at\n1514.\n                             B\n  This suit involves a tract of former crown land on Maui,\nnow known as the \u201cLeiali\u2019i parcel,\u201d that was ceded in\n\u201cabsolute fee\u201d to the United States at annexation and has\nbeen held by the State since 1959 as part of the trust\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nestablished by \u00a75(f) of the Admission Act. The Housing\nFinance and Development Corporation (HFDC)\u2014Hawaii\u2019s\naffordable housing agency\u2014received approval to remove\nthe Leiali\u2019i parcel from the \u00a75(f) trust and redevelop it. In\norder to transfer the Leiali\u2019i parcel out of the public trust,\nHFDC was required to compensate respondent Office of\nHawaiian Affairs (OHA), which was established to receive\nand manage funds from the use or sale of the ceded lands\nfor the benefit of native Hawaiians. Haw. Const., Art. XII,\n\u00a7\u00a74\u20136.\n    In this case, however, OHA demanded more than mone\ntary compensation. Relying on the Apology Resolution,\nrespondent OHA demanded that HFDC include a dis\nclaimer preserving any native Hawaiian claims to owner\nship of lands transferred from the public trust for redevel\nopment.         HFDC declined to include the requested\ndisclaimer because \u201cto do so would place a cloud on title,\nrendering title insurance unavailable.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 207a.\n    Again relying on the Apology Resolution, respondents\nthen sued the State, its Governor, HFDC (since renamed),\nand its officials. Respondents sought \u201cto enjoin the defen\ndants from selling or otherwise transferring the Leiali\u2019i\nparcel to third parties and selling or otherwise transfer\nring to third parties any of the ceded lands in general until\na determination of the native Hawaiians\u2019 claims to the\nceded lands is made.\u201d Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Hous\ning and Community Development Corp. of Hawaii, 117\nHaw. 174, 189, 177 P. 3d 884, 899 (2008). Respondents\n\u201calleged that an injunction was proper because, in light of\nthe Apology Resolution, any transfer of ceded lands by the\nState to third-parties would amount to a breach of trust\n. . . .\u201d Id., at 188, 177 P. 3d, at 898.\n    The state trial court entered judgment against respon\ndents, but the Supreme Court of Hawaii vacated the lower\ncourt\u2019s ruling. Relying on a \u201cplain reading of the Apology\n6         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nResolution,\u201d which \u201cdictate[d]\u201d its conclusion, id., at 212,\n177 P. 3d, at 988, the State Supreme Court ordered \u201can\ninjunction against the defendants from selling or other\nwise transferring to third parties (1) the Leiali\u2019i parcel and\n(2) any other ceded lands from the public lands trust until\nthe claims of the native Hawaiians to the ceded lands have\nbeen resolved,\u201d id., at 218, 177 P. 3d, at 928. In doing so,\nthe court rejected petitioners\u2019 argument that \u201cthe State\nhas the undoubted and explicit power to sell ceded lands\npursuant to the terms of the Admission Act and pursuant\nto state law.\u201d Id., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 920 (internal quo\ntation marks and alterations omitted). We granted certio\nrari. 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                               II\n   Before turning to the merits, we first must address our\njurisdiction. According to respondents, the Supreme Court\nof Hawaii \u201cmerely held that, in light of the ongoing recon\nciliation process, the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\nbreach of the State\u2019s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians\nunder state law.\u201d Brief for Respondents 17. Because\nrespondents believe that this case does not raise a federal\nquestion, they urge us to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   Although respondents dwell at length on that argument,\nsee id., at 19\u201334, we need not tarry long to reject it. This\nCourt has jurisdiction whenever \u201ca state court decision\nfairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be\ninterwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy\nand independence of any possible state law ground is not\nclear from the face of the opinion.\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463\nU. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983). Far from providing a \u201cplain\nstatement\u201d that its decision rested on state law, id., at\n1041, the State Supreme Court plainly held that its deci\nsion was \u201cdictate[d]\u201d by federal law\u2014in particular, the\nApology Resolution, see 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at\n922.

C. \u00a71257.\n                              III\n   Turning to the merits, we must decide whether the\nApology Resolution \u201cstrips Hawaii of its sovereign author\nity to sell, exchange, or transfer\u201d (Pet. for Cert. i) the lands\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Respondents argue that the Supreme Court of Hawaii relied on the\n\nApology Resolution \u201csimply to support its factual determination that\nNative Hawaiians have unresolved claims to the ceded lands.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 21. Regardless of its factual determinations, however, the\nlower court\u2019s legal conclusions were, at the very least, \u201cinterwoven with\nthe federal law.\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040 (1983). See\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs v. Housing and Community Development\nCorp. of Hawaii, 117 Haw. 174, 217, 218, 177 P. 3d 884, 927, 928 (2008)\n(\u201chold[ing]\u201d that respondents\u2019 legal claim \u201carose\u201d only when \u201cthe Apol\nogy Resolution was signed into law on November 23, 1993\u201d); id., at 211,\nn. 25, 177 P. 3d, at 921, n. 25 (emphasizing that \u201cour holding is\ngrounded in Hawai\u2018i and federal law\u201d).

We conclude that\nthe Apology Resolution has no such effect.\n                            A\n   \u201cWe begin, as always, with the text of the statute.\u201d\nPermanent Mission of India to United Nations v. City of\nNew York, 551 U. S. 193, 197 (2007). The Apology Resolu\ntion contains two substantive provisions. See 107 Stat.\n1513\u20131514. Neither justifies the judgment below.\n   The resolution\u2019s first substantive provision uses six\nverbs, all of which are conciliatory or precatory. Specifi\ncally, Congress \u201cacknowledge[d] the historical signifi\ncance\u201d of the Hawaiian monarchy\u2019s overthrow, \u201crecog\nnize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation\u201d with\nnative Hawaiians, \u201capologize[d] to [n]ative Hawaiians\u201d for\nthe monarchy\u2019s overthrow, \u201cexpresse[d] [Congress\u2019s] com\nmitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the over\nthrow,\u201d and \u201curge[d] the President of the United States to\nalso acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow . . . .\u201d\n\u00a71. Such terms are not the kind that Congress uses to\ncreate substantive rights\u2014especially those that are en\nforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g., Penn\nhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.

See, e.g., Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 102 Stat.\n903, 50 U. S. C. App. \u00a71989 (2000 ed.)

By its terms,\n\u00a73 speaks only to those who may or may not have \u201cclaims\nagainst the United States.\u201d The court below, however,\nheld that the only way to save \u00a73 from superfluity is to\nconstrue it as a congressional recognition\u2014and preserva\ntion\u2014of claims against Hawaii and as \u201cthe foundation (or\nstarting point) for reconciliation\u201d between the State and\nnative Hawaiians. 117 Haw., at 192, 177 P. 3d, at 902.\n   \u201cWe must have regard to all the words used by Con\ngress, and as far as possible give effect to them,\u201d Louisville\n& Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 475 (1911),\nbut that maxim is not a judicial license to turn an irrele\nvant statutory provision into a relevant one. And we know\nof no justification for turning an express disclaimer of\nclaims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\ntion of claims against another.4 Cf. Pacific Bell Telephone\nCo. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  court below held that respondents \u201cprevailed on the merits\u201d by\nshowing that \u201cCongress has clearly recognized that the native Hawai\nian people have unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands, which\nwere taken without consent or compensation and which the native\nHawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to\nfuture generations.\u201d 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at 922. And it\nfurther held that petitioners failed to show that the State has the\n\u201cpower to sell ceded lands pursuant to the terms of the Admission Act.\u201d\nId., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 921 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). Respondents now insist, however, that their claims are\n\u201cnonjusticiable\u201d to the extent that they are grounded on \u201cbroader moral\nand political\u201d bases. Brief for Respondents 18. No matter how respon\ndents characterize their claims, it is undeniable that they have asserted\ntitle to the ceded lands throughout this litigation, see id., at 40, n. 15\n(conceding the point), and it is undeniable that the Supreme Court of\nHawaii relied on those claims in issuing an injunction, which is a legal\n(and hence justiciable) remedy\u2014not a moral, political, or nonjusticiable\none.\n10         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(2009) (slip op., at 17) (\u201cTwo wrong claims do not make one\nthat is right\u201d). The Supreme Court of Hawaii erred in\nreading \u00a73 as recognizing claims inconsistent with the title\nheld in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d by the United States (30 Stat. 750)\nand conveyed to the State of Hawaii at statehood. See\nsupra, at 2\u20133.\n                                 B\n  Rather than focusing on the operative words of the law,\nthe court below directed its attention to the 37 \u201cwhereas\u201d\nclauses that preface the Apology Resolution. See 107 Stat.\n1510\u20131513. \u201cBased on a plain reading of\u201d the \u201cwhereas\u201d\nclauses, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that \u201cCongress\nhas clearly recognized that the native Hawaiian people\nhave unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands.\u201d 117\nHaw., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901. That conclusion is wrong\nfor at least three reasons.\n  First, \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses like those in the Apology Reso\nlution cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed\non them. As we recently explained in a different context,\n\u201cwhere the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not\nhave operative effect, such as \u2018whereas\u2019 clauses in federal\nlegislation . . . , a court has no license to make it do what it\nwas not designed to do.\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller,\n554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2008) (slip op., at 4, n. 3). See also\nYazoo & Mississippi Valley R. Co. v. Thomas, 132 U. S.\n174, 188 (1889) (\u201c[A]s the preamble is no part of the act,\nand cannot enlarge or confer powers, nor control the words\nof the act, unless they are doubtful or ambiguous, the\nnecessity of resorting to it to assist in ascertaining the\ntrue intent and meaning of the legislature is in itself fatal\nto the claim set up\u201d).\n  Second, even if the \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses had some legal\neffect, they did not \u201cchang[e] the legal landscape and\nrestructur[e] the rights and obligations of the State.\u201d 117\nHaw., at 190, 177 P. 3d, at 900.

Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 662 (2007) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Apology Resolution reveals\nno indication\u2014much less a \u201cclear and manifest\u201d one\u2014that\nCongress intended to amend or repeal the State\u2019s rights\nand obligations under Admission Act (or any other federal\nlaw); nor does the Apology Resolution reveal any evidence\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to \u201ccloud\u201d the title that\nthe United States held in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d and transferred to\nthe State in 1959. On that score, we find it telling that\neven respondent OHA has now abandoned its argument,\nmade below, that \u201cCongress . . . enacted the Apology Reso\nlution and thus . . . change[d]\u201d the Admission Act. App.\n114a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 37\u201338.\n   Third, the Apology Resolution would raise grave consti\ntutional concerns if it purported to \u201ccloud\u201d Hawaii\u2019s title to\nits sovereign lands more than three decades after the\nState\u2019s admission to the Union. We have emphasized that\n\u201cCongress cannot, after statehood, reserve or convey sub\nmerged lands that have already been bestowed upon a\nState.\u201d Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9\n(2001) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted);\nsee also id., at 284 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he\nconsequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ig\nnores the uniquely sovereign character of that event . . . to\nsuggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish\nwhat has already been bestowed\u201d). And that proposition\napplies a fortiori where virtually all of the State\u2019s public\nlands\u2014not just its submerged ones\u2014are at stake. In light\nof those concerns, we must not read the Apology Resolu\ntion\u2019s nonsubstantive \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses to create a retro\nactive \u201ccloud\u201d on the title that Congress granted to the\nState of Hawaii in 1959.

OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS \n\n                        ET AL. \n\n\n         CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF HAWAII\n\n  No. 07\u20131372. Argued February 25, 2009\u2014Decided March 31, 2009\nAfter the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893, Congress an\n  nexed the Territory of Hawaii pursuant to the Newlands Resolution,\n  under which Hawaii ceded to the United States the \u201cabsolute fee\u201d and\n  ownership of all public, government, and crown lands. In 1959, the\n  Admission Act made Hawaii a State, granting it \u201call the public lands\n  . . . held by the United States,\u201d \u00a75(b), and requiring these lands, \u201cto\n  gether with the proceeds from [their] sale . . . , [to] be held by [the]\n  State as a public trust,\u201d \u00a75(f). Hawaii state law also authorizes the\n  State to use or sell the ceded lands, provided the proceeds are held in\n  trust for Hawaiian citizens. In 1993, Congress\u2019 joint Apology Resolu\n  tion \u201capologize[d]\u201d for this country\u2019s role in overthrowing the Hawai\n  ian monarchy, \u00a71, and declared that nothing in the resolution was\n  \u201cintended to serve as a settlement of any claims against the United\n  States,\u201d \u00a73.\n      The \u201cLeiali\u2019i parcel,\u201d a Maui tract of former crown land, was ceded\n  to the United States at annexation and has been held by the State\n  since 1959 as part of the Admission Act \u00a75(f) trust. Hawaii\u2019s afford\n  able housing agency (HFDC) received approval to remove the parcel\n  from the trust and redevelop it upon compensating respondent Office\n  of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which manages funds from the use or\n  sale of ceded lands for the benefit of native Hawaiians. After HFDC\n  refused OHA\u2019s demand that the payment include a disclaimer pre\n  serving any native Hawaiian claims to lands transferred from the\n  trust for redevelopment, respondents sued to enjoin the sale or trans\n  fer of the Leiali\u2019i parcel and any other of the ceded lands until final\n  determination of native Hawaiians\u2019 claims. The state trial court en\n  tered judgment against respondents, but the Hawaiian Supreme\n  Court vacated that ruling. Relying on the Apology Resolution, the\n2            HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    court granted the injunction that respondents requested, rejecting\n    petitioners\u2019 argument that the Admission Act and state law give the\n    State explicit power to sell ceded lands.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction. Respondents argue to no avail that\n the case does not raise a federal question because the State Supreme\n Court merely held that the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\n breach of the State\u2019s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians under state\n law. The Court has jurisdiction whenever \u201ca state court decision\n fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven\n with the federal law.\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040. Far\n from providing a plain statement that its decision rested on state\n law, the state court plainly held that the decision was dictated by\n federal law, particularly the Apology Resolution. Pp. 6\u20137.\n    2. The Apology Resolution did not strip Hawaii of its sovereign au\n thority to alienate the lands the United States held in absolute fee\n and granted to the State upon its admission to the Union. Pp. 7\u201312.\n       (a) Neither of the resolution\u2019s substantive provisions justifies the\n judgment below. The first such provision\u2019s six verbs\u2014i.e., Congress\n \u201cacknowledge[d] the historical significance\u201d of the monarchy\u2019s over\n throw, \u201crecognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation\u201d with\n native Hawaiians, \u201capologize[d] to [them]\u201d for the overthrow, \u201cex\n presse[d] [the] commitment to acknowledge [the overthrow\u2019s] ramifi\n cations,\u201d and \u201curge[d] the President . . . to also acknowledge [those]\n ramifications,\u201d \u00a71\u2014are all conciliatory or precatory. This is not the\n kind of language Congress uses to create substantive rights, espe\n cially rights enforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g.,\n Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17\u2013\n 18. The resolution\u2019s second substantive provision, the \u00a73 disclaimer,\n by its terms speaks only to those who may or may not have \u201cclaims\n against the United States.\u201d The State Supreme Court, however, read\n \u00a73 as a congressional recognition\u2014and preservation\u2014of claims\n against Hawaii. There is no justification for turning an express dis\n claimer of claims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\n tion of claims against another. Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the 37 \u201cwhereas\u201d\n clauses prefacing the Apology Resolution clearly recognize native\n Hawaiians\u2019 \u201cunrelinquished\u201d claims over the ceded lands is wrong for\n at least three reasons. First, such \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses cannot bear the\n weight that the lower court placed on them. See, e.g., District of Co\n lumbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3. Second, even if the clauses\n had some legal effect, they did not restructure Hawaii\u2019s rights and\n obligations, as the lower court found. \u201c[R]epeals by implication are\n not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the leg\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, ___. The Apology\n  Resolution reveals no such intention, much less a clear and manifest\n  one. Third, because the resolution would raise grave constitutional\n  concerns if it purported to \u201ccloud\u201d Hawaii\u2019s title to its sovereign lands\n  more than three decades after the State\u2019s admission to the Union,\n  see, e.g., Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9, the Court re\n  fuses to read the nonsubstantive \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses to create such a\n  \u201ccloud\u201d retroactively, see, e.g., Clark v.

Pursuant to the Newlands Resolution, the\nRepublic of Hawaii \u201ccede[d] absolutely and without re\nserve to the United States of America all rights of sover\neignty of whatsoever kind\u201d and further \u201ccede[d] and trans\nfer[red] to the United States the absolute fee and\nownership of all public, Government, or Crown lands,\npublic buildings or edifices, ports, harbors, military\nequipment, and all other public property of every kind and\ndescription belonging to the Government of the Hawaiian\nIslands, together with every right and appurtenance\nthereunto appertaining\u201d (hereinafter ceded lands).1 Ibid.\nThe Newlands Resolution further provided that all \u201cprop\nerty and rights\u201d in the ceded lands \u201care vested in the\nUnited States of America.\u201d Ibid.\n  Two years later, Congress established a government for\nthe Territory of Hawaii. See Act of Apr. 30, 1900, ch. 339,\n31 Stat. 141 (hereinafter Organic Act). The Organic Act\nreiterated the Newlands Resolution and made clear that\nthe new Territory consisted of the land that the United\nStates acquired in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d under that resolution.\nSee \u00a72, ibid. The Organic Act further provided:\n    \u201c[T]he portion of the public domain heretofore known\n    as Crown land is hereby declared to have been, on [the\n    effective date of the Newlands Resolution], and prior\n    thereto, the property of the Hawaiian government,\n    and to be free and clear from any trust of or concern\n    ing the same, and from all claim of any nature what\n    soever, upon the rents, issues, and profits thereof. It\n    shall be subject to alienation and other uses as may be\n    provided by law.\u201d \u00a799, id., at 161; see also \u00a791, id., at\n    159.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 \u201cCrown lands\u201d were lands formerly held by the Hawaiian monarchy.\n\n\u201cPublic\u201d and \u201cGovernment\u201d lands were other lands held by the Hawai\nian government.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1959, Congress admitted Hawaii to the Union. See\nPub. L. 86\u20133, 73 Stat. 4 (hereinafter Admission Act).\nUnder the Admission Act, with exceptions not relevant\nhere, \u201cthe United States grant[ed] to the State of Hawaii,\neffective upon its admission into the Union, the United\nStates\u2019 title to all the public lands and other public prop\nerty within the boundaries of the State of Hawaii, title to\nwhich is held by the United States immediately prior to its\nadmission into the Union.\u201d \u00a75(b), id., at 5. These lands,\n\u201ctogether with the proceeds from the sale or other disposi\ntion of [these] lands and the income therefrom, shall be\nheld by [the] State as a public trust\u201d to promote various\npublic purposes, including supporting public education,\nbettering conditions of Native Hawaiians, developing\nhome ownership, making public improvements, and pro\nviding lands for public use. \u00a75(f), id., at 6. Hawaii state\nlaw also authorizes the State to use or sell the ceded\nlands, provided that the proceeds are held in trust for the\nbenefit of the citizens of Hawaii. See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7\u00a7171\u201345, 171\u201318 (1993).\n   In 1993, Congress enacted a joint resolution \u201cto ac\nknowledge the historic significance of the illegal overthrow\nof the Kingdom of Hawaii, to express its deep regret to the\nNative Hawaiian people, and to support the reconciliation\nefforts of the State of Hawaii and the United Church of\nChrist with Native Hawaiians.\u201d Joint Resolution to Ac\nknowledge the 100th Anniversary of the January 17, 1893\nOverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Pub. L. 103\u2013150,\n107 Stat. 1510, 1513 (hereinafter Apology Resolution). In\na series of the preambular \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses, Congress\nmade various observations about Hawaii\u2019s history. For\nexample, the Apology Resolution states that \u201cthe indige\nnous Hawaiian people never directly relinquished their\nclaims . . . over their national lands to the United States\u201d\nand that \u201cthe health and well-being of the Native Hawai\nian people is intrinsically tied to their deep feelings and\n4         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattachment to the land.\u201d Id., at 1512. In the same vein,\nthe resolution\u2019s only substantive section\u2014entitled \u201cAc\nknowledgement and Apology\u201d\u2014states that Congress:\n       \u201c(1) . . . acknowledges the historical significance of\n    this event which resulted in the suppression of the in\n    herent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people;\n       \u201c(2) recognizes and commends efforts of reconcilia\n    tion initiated by the State of Hawaii and the United\n    Church of Christ with Native Hawaiians;\n       \u201c(3) apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the\n    people of the United States for the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the par\n    ticipation of agents and citizens of the United States,\n    and the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians\n    to self-determination;\n       \u201c(4) expresses its commitment to acknowledge the\n    ramifications of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Ha\n    waii, in order to provide a proper foundation for rec\n    onciliation between the United States and the Native\n    Hawaiian people; and\n       \u201c(5) urges the President of the United States to also\n    acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of the\n    Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation ef\n    forts between the United States and the Native Ha\n    waiian people.\u201d Id., at 1513.\nFinally, \u00a73 of the Apology Resolution states that \u201cNothing\nin this Joint Resolution is intended to serve as a settle\nment of any claims against the United States.\u201d Id., at\n1514.\n                             B\n  This suit involves a tract of former crown land on Maui,\nnow known as the \u201cLeiali\u2019i parcel,\u201d that was ceded in\n\u201cabsolute fee\u201d to the United States at annexation and has\nbeen held by the State since 1959 as part of the trust\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nestablished by \u00a75(f) of the Admission Act. The Housing\nFinance and Development Corporation (HFDC)\u2014Hawaii\u2019s\naffordable housing agency\u2014received approval to remove\nthe Leiali\u2019i parcel from the \u00a75(f) trust and redevelop it. In\norder to transfer the Leiali\u2019i parcel out of the public trust,\nHFDC was required to compensate respondent Office of\nHawaiian Affairs (OHA), which was established to receive\nand manage funds from the use or sale of the ceded lands\nfor the benefit of native Hawaiians. Haw. Const., Art. XII,\n\u00a7\u00a74\u20136.\n    In this case, however, OHA demanded more than mone\ntary compensation. Relying on the Apology Resolution,\nrespondent OHA demanded that HFDC include a dis\nclaimer preserving any native Hawaiian claims to owner\nship of lands transferred from the public trust for redevel\nopment.         HFDC declined to include the requested\ndisclaimer because \u201cto do so would place a cloud on title,\nrendering title insurance unavailable.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 207a.\n    Again relying on the Apology Resolution, respondents\nthen sued the State, its Governor, HFDC (since renamed),\nand its officials. Respondents sought \u201cto enjoin the defen\ndants from selling or otherwise transferring the Leiali\u2019i\nparcel to third parties and selling or otherwise transfer\nring to third parties any of the ceded lands in general until\na determination of the native Hawaiians\u2019 claims to the\nceded lands is made.\u201d Office of Hawaiian Affairs v.

Respondents\n\u201calleged that an injunction was proper because, in light of\nthe Apology Resolution, any transfer of ceded lands by the\nState to third-parties would amount to a breach of trust\n. . . .\u201d Id., at 188, 177 P. 3d, at 898.\n    The state trial court entered judgment against respon\ndents, but the Supreme Court of Hawaii vacated the lower\ncourt\u2019s ruling. Relying on a \u201cplain reading of the Apology\n6         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nResolution,\u201d which \u201cdictate[d]\u201d its conclusion, id., at 212,\n177 P. 3d, at 988, the State Supreme Court ordered \u201can\ninjunction against the defendants from selling or other\nwise transferring to third parties (1) the Leiali\u2019i parcel and\n(2) any other ceded lands from the public lands trust until\nthe claims of the native Hawaiians to the ceded lands have\nbeen resolved,\u201d id., at 218, 177 P. 3d, at 928. In doing so,\nthe court rejected petitioners\u2019 argument that \u201cthe State\nhas the undoubted and explicit power to sell ceded lands\npursuant to the terms of the Admission Act and pursuant\nto state law.\u201d Id., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 920 (internal quo\ntation marks and alterations omitted). We granted certio\nrari. 555 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                               II\n   Before turning to the merits, we first must address our\njurisdiction. According to respondents, the Supreme Court\nof Hawaii \u201cmerely held that, in light of the ongoing recon\nciliation process, the sale of ceded lands would constitute a\nbreach of the State\u2019s fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians\nunder state law.\u201d Brief for Respondents 17. Because\nrespondents believe that this case does not raise a federal\nquestion, they urge us to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n   Although respondents dwell at length on that argument,\nsee id., at 19\u201334, we need not tarry long to reject it. This\nCourt has jurisdiction whenever \u201ca state court decision\nfairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be\ninterwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy\nand independence of any possible state law ground is not\nclear from the face of the opinion.\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463\nU. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983). Far from providing a \u201cplain\nstatement\u201d that its decision rested on state law, id., at\n1041, the State Supreme Court plainly held that its deci\nsion was \u201cdictate[d]\u201d by federal law\u2014in particular, the\nApology Resolution, see 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at\n922. Indeed, the court explained that the Apology Resolu\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion lies \u201c[a]t the heart of [respondents\u2019] claims,\u201d that\nrespondents\u2019 \u201ccurrent claim for injunctive relief is . . .\nbased largely upon the Apology Resolution,\u201d and that\nrespondents\u2019 arguments presuppose that the Apology\nResolution \u201cchanged the legal landscape and restructured\nthe rights and obligations of the State.\u201d Id., at 189\u2013190,\n177 P. 3d, at 899\u2013900 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe court noted that \u201c[t]he primary question before this\ncourt on appeal is whether, in light of the Apology Resolu\ntion, this court should issue an injunction\u201d against sale of\nthe trust lands, id., at 210, 177 P. 3d, at 920, and it con\ncluded, \u201c[b]ased on a plain reading\u201d of the Apology Resolu\ntion, that \u201cCongress has clearly recognized that the native\nHawaiian people have unrelinquished claims over the\nceded lands,\u201d id., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901.\n   Based on these and the remainder of the State Supreme\nCourt\u2019s 77 references to the Apology Resolution, we have\nno doubt that the decision below rested on federal law.2\nWe are therefore satisfied that this Court has jurisdiction.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a71257.\n                              III\n   Turning to the merits, we must decide whether the\nApology Resolution \u201cstrips Hawaii of its sovereign author\nity to sell, exchange, or transfer\u201d (Pet. for Cert. i) the lands\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Respondents argue that the Supreme Court of Hawaii relied on the\n\nApology Resolution \u201csimply to support its factual determination that\nNative Hawaiians have unresolved claims to the ceded lands.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 21. Regardless of its factual determinations, however, the\nlower court\u2019s legal conclusions were, at the very least, \u201cinterwoven with\nthe federal law.\u201d Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040 (1983). See\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs v. Housing and Community Development\nCorp. of Hawaii, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Haw.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217, 218, 177 P. 3d 884, 927, 928 (2008)\n(\u201chold[ing]\u201d that respondents\u2019 legal claim \u201carose\u201d only when \u201cthe Apol\nogy Resolution was signed into law on November 23, 1993\u201d); id., at 211,\nn. 25, 177 P. 3d, at 921, n. 25 (emphasizing that \u201cour holding is\ngrounded in Hawai\u2018i and federal law\u201d). See also n. 4, infra.\n8           HAWAII v.

We conclude that\nthe Apology Resolution has no such effect.\n                            A\n   \u201cWe begin, as always, with the text of the statute.\u201d\nPermanent Mission of India to United Nations v. City of\nNew York, 551 U. S. 193, 197 (2007). The Apology Resolu\ntion contains two substantive provisions. See 107 Stat.\n1513\u20131514. Neither justifies the judgment below.\n   The resolution\u2019s first substantive provision uses six\nverbs, all of which are conciliatory or precatory. Specifi\ncally, Congress \u201cacknowledge[d] the historical signifi\ncance\u201d of the Hawaiian monarchy\u2019s overthrow, \u201crecog\nnize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation\u201d with\nnative Hawaiians, \u201capologize[d] to [n]ative Hawaiians\u201d for\nthe monarchy\u2019s overthrow, \u201cexpresse[d] [Congress\u2019s] com\nmitment to acknowledge the ramifications of the over\nthrow,\u201d and \u201curge[d] the President of the United States to\nalso acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow . . . .\u201d\n\u00a71. Such terms are not the kind that Congress uses to\ncreate substantive rights\u2014especially those that are en\nforceable against the cosovereign States. See, e.g., Penn\nhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S.\n1, 17\u201318 (1981).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 TheApology Resolution\u2019s operative provisions thus stand in sharp\ncontrast with those of other \u201capologies,\u201d which Congress intended to\nhave substantive effect. See, e.g., Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 102 Stat.\n903, 50 U. S. C. App. \u00a71989 (2000 ed.)

By its terms,\n\u00a73 speaks only to those who may or may not have \u201cclaims\nagainst the United States.\u201d The court below, however,\nheld that the only way to save \u00a73 from superfluity is to\nconstrue it as a congressional recognition\u2014and preserva\ntion\u2014of claims against Hawaii and as \u201cthe foundation (or\nstarting point) for reconciliation\u201d between the State and\nnative Hawaiians. 117 Haw., at 192, 177 P. 3d, at 902.\n   \u201cWe must have regard to all the words used by Con\ngress, and as far as possible give effect to them,\u201d Louisville\n& Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 475 (1911),\nbut that maxim is not a judicial license to turn an irrele\nvant statutory provision into a relevant one. And we know\nof no justification for turning an express disclaimer of\nclaims against one sovereign into an affirmative recogni\ntion of claims against another.4 Cf. Pacific Bell Telephone\nCo. v. linkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  court below held that respondents \u201cprevailed on the merits\u201d by\nshowing that \u201cCongress has clearly recognized that the native Hawai\nian people have unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands, which\nwere taken without consent or compensation and which the native\nHawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to\nfuture generations.\u201d 117 Haw., at 212, 177 P. 3d, at 922. And it\nfurther held that petitioners failed to show that the State has the\n\u201cpower to sell ceded lands pursuant to the terms of the Admission Act.\u201d\nId., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 921 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted). Respondents now insist, however, that their claims are\n\u201cnonjusticiable\u201d to the extent that they are grounded on \u201cbroader moral\nand political\u201d bases. Brief for Respondents 18. No matter how respon\ndents characterize their claims, it is undeniable that they have asserted\ntitle to the ceded lands throughout this litigation, see id., at 40, n. 15\n(conceding the point), and it is undeniable that the Supreme Court of\nHawaii relied on those claims in issuing an injunction, which is a legal\n(and hence justiciable) remedy\u2014not a moral, political, or nonjusticiable\none.\n10         HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(2009) (slip op., at 17) (\u201cTwo wrong claims do not make one\nthat is right\u201d). The Supreme Court of Hawaii erred in\nreading \u00a73 as recognizing claims inconsistent with the title\nheld in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d by the United States (30 Stat. 750)\nand conveyed to the State of Hawaii at statehood. See\nsupra, at 2\u20133.\n                                 B\n  Rather than focusing on the operative words of the law,\nthe court below directed its attention to the 37 \u201cwhereas\u201d\nclauses that preface the Apology Resolution. See 107 Stat.\n1510\u20131513. \u201cBased on a plain reading of\u201d the \u201cwhereas\u201d\nclauses, the Supreme Court of Hawaii held that \u201cCongress\nhas clearly recognized that the native Hawaiian people\nhave unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands.\u201d 117\nHaw., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901. That conclusion is wrong\nfor at least three reasons.\n  First, \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses like those in the Apology Reso\nlution cannot bear the weight that the lower court placed\non them. As we recently explained in a different context,\n\u201cwhere the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not\nhave operative effect, such as \u2018whereas\u2019 clauses in federal\nlegislation . . . , a court has no license to make it do what it\nwas not designed to do.\u201d District of Columbia v.

Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 662 (2007) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Apology Resolution reveals\nno indication\u2014much less a \u201cclear and manifest\u201d one\u2014that\nCongress intended to amend or repeal the State\u2019s rights\nand obligations under Admission Act (or any other federal\nlaw); nor does the Apology Resolution reveal any evidence\nthat Congress intended sub silentio to \u201ccloud\u201d the title that\nthe United States held in \u201cabsolute fee\u201d and transferred to\nthe State in 1959. On that score, we find it telling that\neven respondent OHA has now abandoned its argument,\nmade below, that \u201cCongress . . . enacted the Apology Reso\nlution and thus . . . change[d]\u201d the Admission Act. App.\n114a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 37\u201338.\n   Third, the Apology Resolution would raise grave consti\ntutional concerns if it purported to \u201ccloud\u201d Hawaii\u2019s title to\nits sovereign lands more than three decades after the\nState\u2019s admission to the Union. We have emphasized that\n\u201cCongress cannot, after statehood, reserve or convey sub\nmerged lands that have already been bestowed upon a\nState.\u201d Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9\n(2001) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted);\nsee also id., at 284 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he\nconsequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ig\nnores the uniquely sovereign character of that event . . . to\nsuggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish\nwhat has already been bestowed\u201d). And that proposition\napplies a fortiori where virtually all of the State\u2019s public\nlands\u2014not just its submerged ones\u2014are at stake. In light\nof those concerns, we must not read the Apology Resolu\ntion\u2019s nonsubstantive \u201cwhereas\u201d clauses to create a retro\nactive \u201ccloud\u201d on the title that Congress granted to the\nState of Hawaii in 1959. See, e.g., Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 381\u2013382 (2005) (the canon of constitutional\n12        HAWAII v. OFFICE OF HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\navoidance \u201cis a tool for choosing between competing plau\nsible interpretations of a statutory text, resting on the\nreasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the\nalternative which raises serious constitutional doubts\u201d).\n                         *     *    *\n   When a state supreme court incorrectly bases a decision\non federal law, the court\u2019s decision improperly prevents\nthe citizens of the State from addressing the issue in\nquestion through the processes provided by the State\u2019s\nconstitution. Here, the State Supreme Court incorrectly\nheld that Congress, by adopting the Apology Resolution,\ntook away from the citizens of Hawaii the authority to\nresolve an issue that is of great importance to the people of\nthe State. Respondents defend that decision by arguing\nthat they have both state-law property rights in the land\nin question and \u201cbroader moral and political claims for\ncompensation for the wrongs of the past.\u201d Brief for Re\nspondents 18. But we have no authority to decide ques\ntions of Hawaiian law or to provide redress for past\nwrongs except as provided for by federal law. The judg\nment of the Supreme Court of Hawaii is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
