MIRZAYANCE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 07\u20131315. Argued January 13, 2009\u2014Decided March 24, 2009\nRespondent Mirzayance entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by\n  reason of insanity (NGI) at his state-court murder trial. During the\n  guilt phase, he sought to avoid a conviction for first-degree murder\n  and instead obtain a second-degree murder verdict by presenting\n  medical testimony that he was insane at the time of the crime and\n  was, therefore, incapable of the necessary premeditation or delibera\n  tion. The jury nevertheless convicted him of first-degree murder. Af\n  ter the trial\u2019s NGI phase was scheduled, Mirzayance accepted his\n  counsel\u2019s recommendation to abandon the insanity plea. Counsel be\n  lieved that a defense verdict was unlikely because the jury had just\n  rejected medical testimony similar to that which would be presented\n  to establish the NGI defense. Moreover, although counsel had\n  planned to supplement the medical evidence with testimony by Mir\n  zayance\u2019s parents as to their son\u2019s mental illness, the parents refused\n  to testify at the last moment. Following his conviction, Mirzayance\n  alleged in state postconviction proceedings that his attorney\u2019s rec\n  ommendation to withdraw the NGI plea constituted ineffective assis\n  tance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The\n  trial court denied relief, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.\n     Mirzayance then applied for federal habeas relief, which the Dis\n  trict Court denied. The Ninth Circuit reversed, ordering an eviden\n  tiary hearing on counsel\u2019s recommendation to withdraw the NGI\n  plea. During the hearing, the Magistrate Judge made extensive fact\n  findings, including, inter alia, that the NGI phase medical evidence\n  essentially would have duplicated the evidence the jury rejected in\n  the guilt phase; that counsel doubted the likelihood of prevailing on\n  the NGI claim because the jury\u2019s finding of first-degree murder as a\n  practical matter would cripple Mirzayance\u2019s chances of convincing\n2                      KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the jury that he nevertheless was incapable of understanding the na\n    ture and quality of his act and of distinguishing right from wrong;\n    that Mirzayance\u2019s parents were not simply reluctant, but had effec\n    tively refused, to testify; that counsel had made a carefully reasoned\n    decision not to proceed with the NGI plea after weighing his options\n    and discussing the matter with experienced co-counsel; but that\n    counsel\u2019s performance was nevertheless deficient because Mirzayance\n    had \u201cnothing to lose\u201d by going forward with the NGI phase of the\n    trial. The Magistrate Judge also found prejudice and recommended\n    habeas relief. The District Court accepted the recommendation and\n    granted the writ. The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling, among other\n    things, that counsel\u2019s performance had been deficient because Mir\n    zayance\u2019s parents had not refused, but had merely expressed reluc\n    tance to testify, and because competent counsel would have at\n    tempted to persuade them to testify, which Mirzayance\u2019s counsel\n    admittedly did not. The court essentially concluded that competent\n    counsel would have pursued the insanity defense because counsel\n    had nothing to lose by putting on the only defense available. In addi\n    tion, the court found prejudice because, in the court\u2019s view, there was\n    a reasonable probability the jury would have found Mirzayance in\n    sane had counsel pursued the NGI phase. The Ninth Circuit con\n    cluded that federal habeas relief was authorized under 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a72254(d)(1) because the California Court of Appeal had \u201cunreason\n    abl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.\u201d\nHeld: Whether the state-court decision is reviewed under \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s\n standard or de novo, Mirzayance has failed to establish that his coun\n sel\u2019s performance was ineffective. Pp. 8\u201316.\n    (a) The State Court of Appeal\u2019s denial of Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\n assistance claim did not violate clearly established federal law. The\n Ninth Circuit reached a contrary result based largely on its applica\n tion of an improper review standard\u2014it blamed counsel for abandon\n ing the NGI claim because there was \u201cnothing to lose\u201d by pursuing it.\n But it is not \u201can unreasonable application of clearly established Fed\n eral law\u201d for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that\n has not been squarely established by this Court. See, e.g., Wright v.\n Van Patten, 552 U. S. ___, ___. Absent anything akin to the \u201cnothing\n to lose\u201d standard in this Court\u2019s precedent, habeas relief could have\n been granted under \u00a72254(d)(1) only if the state-court decision in this\n case had unreasonably applied Strickland\u2019s more general standard\n for ineffective-assistance claims, whereby a defendant must show\n both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice, 466 U. S., at\n 687. The question \u201cis not whether a federal court believes the state\n court\u2019s determination\u201d under Strickland \u201cwas incorrect but whether\n [it] was unreasonable\u2014a substantially higher threshold.\u201d Schriro v.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473. And, because Strickland\u2019s is a gen\n  eral standard, a state court has even more latitude to reasonably de\n  termine that a defendant has not satisfied that standard. Under the\n  doubly deferential judicial review that applies to a Strickland claim\n  evaluated under the \u00a72254(d)(1) standard, Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\n  assistance claim fails. It was not unreasonable for the state court to\n  conclude that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient when he coun\n  seled Mirzayance to abandon a claim that stood almost no chance of\n  success. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    (b) Even if Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim were eligible\n  for de novo review, it would still fail because he has not shown inef\n  fective assistance at all. Mirzayance can establish neither the defi\n  cient performance nor the prejudice required by Strickland. As to\n  performance, he has not shown \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell be\n  low an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d 466 U. S., at 687\u2013688.\n  Rather, counsel merely recommended the withdrawal of what he rea\n  sonably believed was a claim doomed because similar medical testi\n  mony had already been rejected and the parents\u2019 testimony, which he\n  believed to be his strongest evidence, would not be available. The\n  Ninth Circuit\u2019s position that competent counsel might have per\n  suaded the reluctant parents to testify is in tension with the Magis\n  trate Judge\u2019s contrary findings and applies a more demanding stan\n  dard than Strickland prescribes. The failure to show ineffective\n  assistance is also confirmed by the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that\n  counsel\u2019s decision was essentially an informed one \u201cmade after thor\n  ough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options,\u201d and\n  was therefore \u201cvirtually unchallengeable.\u201d Id., at 690. The Ninth\n  Circuit\u2019s insistence that counsel was required to assert the only de\n  fense available, even one almost certain to lose, is not supported by\n  any \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d of which the Court is aware. See\n  id., at 688. Nor has Mirzayance demonstrated that he suffered\n  prejudice, which requires a showing of \u201ca reasonable probability that,\n  but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\n  would have been different.\u201d See id., at 694. In fact, it was highly im\n  probable that the jury, having just rejected testimony about Mir\n  zayance\u2019s mental condition in the guilt phase, would have reached a\n  different result based on similar evidence at the NGI phase.

ALEXANDRE MIRZAYANCE\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 24, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.*\n  A federal court may grant a habeas corpus application\narising from a state-court adjudication on the merits if the\nstate court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal\nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United\nStates.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). In this case, respondent\nAlexandre Mirzayance claimed ineffective assistance of\ncounsel because his attorney recommended withdrawing\nhis insanity defense. The California courts rejected this\nclaim on state postconviction review. We must decide\nwhether this decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established federal law. We hold\nthat it was not. Whether reviewed under the standard of\nreview set forth in \u00a72254(d)(1) or de novo, Mirzayance\nfailed to establish that his counsel\u2019s performance was\nineffective, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join all but\nPart II of this opinion.\n2                KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n  Mirzayance confessed that he stabbed his 19-year-old\ncousin nine times with a hunting knife and then shot her\nfour times. At trial, he entered pleas of not guilty and not\nguilty by reason of insanity (NGI). Under California law,\nwhen both of these pleas are entered, the court must hold\na bifurcated trial, with guilt determined during the first\nphase and the viability of the defendant\u2019s NGI plea during\nthe second. Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71026(a) (West 1985).\nDuring the guilt phase of Mirzayance\u2019s trial, he sought to\navoid a conviction for first-degree murder by obtaining a\nverdict on the lesser included offense of second-degree\nmurder. To that end, he presented medical testimony that\nhe was insane at the time of the crime and was, therefore,\nincapable of the premeditation or deliberation necessary\nfor a first-degree murder conviction. The jury neverthe\nless convicted Mirzayance of first-degree murder.\n  The trial judge set the NGI phase to begin the day after\nthe conviction was entered but, on the advice of counsel,\nMirzayance abandoned his NGI plea before it commenced.\nHe would have borne the burden of proving his insanity\nduring the NGI phase to the same jury that had just con\nvicted him of first-degree murder. Counsel had planned to\nmeet that burden by presenting medical testimony similar\nto that presented in the guilt phase, including evidence\nthat Mirzayance was insane and incapable of premeditat\ning or deliberating. Because the jury rejected similar\nevidence at the guilt phase (where the State bore the\nburden of proof), counsel believed a defense verdict at the\nNGI phase (where the burden was on the defendant) was\nunlikely. He planned, though, to have Mirzayance\u2019s par\nents testify and thus provide an emotional account of\nMirzayance\u2019s struggles with mental illness to supplement\nthe medical evidence of insanity. But on the morning that\nthe NGI phase was set to begin, Mirzayance\u2019s parents\nrefused to testify. After consulting with co-counsel, coun\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsel advised Mirzayance that he should withdraw the NGI\nplea. Mirzayance accepted the advice.\n   After he was sentenced, Mirzayance challenged his\nconviction in state postconviction proceedings. Among\nother allegations, he claimed that counsel\u2019s recommenda\ntion to withdraw the NGI plea constituted ineffective\nassistance of counsel under Strickland. The California\ntrial court denied the petition and the California Court of\nAppeal affirmed without offering any reason for its rejec\ntion of this particular ineffective assistance claim. People\nv. Mirzayance, Nos. B116856, B124764 (Mar. 31, 1999),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 165\u2013167, 200\u2013201 (hereinafter App.).\nMirzayance then filed an application for federal habeas\nrelief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254, which the District Court\ndenied without an evidentiary hearing. The Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court and ordered an evi\ndentiary hearing on counsel\u2019s recommendation to with\ndraw the NGI plea. Mirzayance v. Hickman, 66 Fed.\nAppx. 676, 679\u2013681 (CA9 2003). During that evidentiary\nhearing, a Magistrate Judge made factual findings that\nthe District Court later adopted. Post-Remand Report and\nRecommendation of United States Magistrate Judge in\nNo. CV 00\u201301388 DT (RZ) (CD Cal.), App. 38, 68; Mir\nzayance v. Knowles, No. CV 00\u20131388 DT (RZ) (CD Cal.,\nNov. 15, 2004), id., at 35\u201336.\n   According to the Magistrate Judge, counsel\u2019s strategy\nfor the two-part trial was to seek a second-degree murder\nverdict in the first stage and to seek an NGI verdict in the\nsecond stage. This strategy faltered when the jury instead\nconvicted Mirzayance of first-degree murder. In the cir\ncumstances of this case, the medical evidence that Mir\nzayance planned to adduce at the NGI phase essentially\nwould have duplicated evidence that the jury had neces\nsarily rejected in the guilt phase. First-degree murder in\nCalifornia includes any killing that is \u201cwillful, deliberate,\nand premeditated.\u201d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7189 (West\n4                 KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1999). To prove NGI, a defendant must show that he was\nincapable of knowing or understanding the nature of his\nact or of distinguishing right from wrong at the time of the\noffense. See People v. Lawley, 27 Cal. 4th 102, 170, 38\nP. 3d 461, 508 (2002). Highlighting this potential contra\ndiction, the trial judge instructed the jury during the guilt\nphase that \u201c[t]he word \u2018deliberate,\u2019 \u201d as required for a first\ndegree murder conviction, \u201cmeans formed or arrived at or\ndetermined upon as a result of careful thought and weigh\ning of considerations for and against the proposed course\nof action.\u201d App. 48\u201349.\n   When the jury found Mirzayance guilty of first-degree\nmurder, counsel doubted the likelihood of prevailing on\nthe NGI claim. According to the Magistrate Judge:\n    \u201cThe defense suspected that a jury\u2019s finding, beyond a\n    reasonable doubt, that [Mirzayance] had \u2018deliberated\u2019\n    and \u2018premeditated\u2019 his killing of [the victim] as a prac\n    tical matter would cripple [Mirzayance\u2019s] chances of\n    convincing the jury later, during the sanity phase,\n    that [Mirzayance] nevertheless \u2018was incapable of\n    knowing or understanding the nature and quality of\n    his . . . act and of distinguishing right from wrong at\n    the time of the commission of the offense,\u2019 Cal. Penal\n    Code \u00a725(b), . . . .\n         .           .           .          .           .\n    \u201cAny remaining chance of securing an NGI verdict . . .\n    now depended (in [counsel\u2019s] view) on presenting some\n    \u2018emotional [im]pact\u2019 testimony by [Mirzayance\u2019s] par\n    ents, which [counsel] had viewed as key even if\n    the defense had secured a second-degree murder ver\n    dict at the guilt phase.\u201d Id., at 50\u201351 (emphasis in\n    original; capitalization omitted).\n  But, as the Magistrate Judge found, on the morning\nthat the NGI phase was set to begin, Mirzayance\u2019s parents\neffectively refused to testify:\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 5\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201c[T]he parents at least expressed clear reluctance to\n    testify, which, in context, conveyed the same sense as\n    a refusal.\u201d Id., at 72 (emphasis in original).\nAlthough the parties disputed this point, the parents\u2019 later\nactions supported the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that the\nparents\u2019 reluctance to testify amounted to refusal:\n      \u201cCorroborating the Court\u2019s finding that [Mir\n    zayance\u2019s] parents indicated a strong disinclination to\n    testify at the NGI phase are the facts that (1) they did\n    not testify later at his sentencing hearing, and (2) the\n    reason for their choosing not to do so . . . is that . . . [it]\n    would have been \u2018too emotional\u2019 for them. . . . If weeks\n    after the guilty verdict and the withdrawal of their\n    son\u2019s NGI plea, [Mirzayance\u2019s] parents\u2019 emotions still\n    prevented them from testifying at the sentencing\n    hearing, then surely those emotional obstacles to their\n    testifying in the NGI phase would have been at least\n    as potent, and probably more so.\u201d Id., at 73 (emphasis\n    in original).\n  The Magistrate Judge found that counsel made a care\nfully reasoned decision not to go forward with the NGI\nplea:\n    \u201c[Counsel] carefully weighed his options before mak\n    ing his decision final; he did not make it rashly. . . .\n    [Counsel\u2019s] strategy at the NGI phase . . . depended\n    entirely on the heartfelt participation of [Mir\n    zayance\u2019s] parents as witnesses. . . . Moreover, [coun\n    sel] knew that, although he had experts lined up to\n    testify, their testimony had significant weak\n    nesses. . . . [Counsel\u2019s] NGI-phase strategy became\n    impossible to attempt once [Mirzayance\u2019s] parents . . .\n    expressed . . . their reluctance to [testify] . . . . All\n    [counsel] was left with were four experts, all of whom\n    reached a conclusion\u2014that [Mirzayance] did not pre\n6                KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    meditate and deliberate his crime\u2014that the same jury\n    about to hear the NGI evidence already had rejected\n    under a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof.\n    The experts were subject to other impeachment as\n    well. . . . [Counsel] discussed the situation with his\n    experienced co-counsel . . . who concurred in [coun\n    sel\u2019s] proposal that he recommend to [Mirzayance] the\n    withdrawal of the NGI plea.\u201d Id., at 69\u201371.\nBased on these factual findings, the Magistrate Judge\nstated that, in his view, counsel\u2019s performance was not\ndeficient.\n    Despite this determination, the Magistrate Judge con\ncluded that the court was bound by the Court of Appeals\u2019\nremand order to determine only whether \u201c \u2018there were\ntactical reasons for abandoning the insanity defense.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 98 (quoting Hickman, 66 Fed. Appx., at 680). Even\nthough the Magistrate Judge thought that counsel was\nreasonable in recommending that a very weak claim be\ndropped, the Magistrate Judge understood the remand\norder to mean that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient if\nwithdrawing the NGI plea would achieve no tactical ad\nvantage. The Magistrate Judge found that \u201c[Mirzayance]\nhad nothing to lose\u201d by going forward with the NGI phase\nof the trial, App. 100, and thus held, under the remand\norder, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, ibid. As\nto prejudice, the Magistrate Judge concluded the court\nwas similarly bound by the remand order because the\nCourt of Appeals described the NGI defense as remaining\n\u201c \u2018viable and strong.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 98 (quoting Hickman, supra,\nat 681). Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge found preju\ndice and recommended granting the writ of habeas corpus.\nThe District Court accepted this recommendation and\ngranted the writ.\n    The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Ibid.; App. 98\u201399.\nNonetheless, the Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of\ndeficient performance. According to the court, Mir\nzayance\u2019s \u201cparents did not refuse, but merely expressed\nreluctance to testify.\u201d Knowles, 175 Fed. Appx., at 144.\nAnd because they may have been willing, \u201c[c]ompetent\ncounsel would have attempted to persuade them to testify,\nwhich counsel here admits he did not.\u201d Ibid.1 The Court\nof Appeals also \u201cdisagree[d] that counsel\u2019s decision was\ncarefully weighed and not made rashly.\u201d Ibid.\n   Furthermore, even though it had suggested that the\nDistrict Court unnecessarily evaluated counsel\u2019s strategy\nunder a \u201cnothing to lose\u201d standard, the Court of Appeals\naffirmed the District Court in large part because Mir\nzayance\u2019s \u201ccounsel did not make a true tactical choice\u201d\nbased on its view that counsel had nothing to gain by\ndropping the NGI defense. Ibid. The court held that\n\u201c[r]easonably effective assistance would put on the only\ndefense available, especially in a case such as this where\nthere was significant potential for success.\u201d Id., at 145\n(internal quotation marks omitted).

According to the Magis\ntrate Judge, counsel testified that he did attempt to persuade the\nparents to testify but that their response \u201c \u2018was kind of flat, and I had\nno influence over them.\u2019 \u201d App. 54 (quoting testimony from evidentiary\nhearing). In his efforts to convince the parents to testify, counsel told\nthem that Mirzayance \u201chad no chance of securing an NGI verdict\nwithout the \u2018emotional quality from nonprofessional witnesses\u2019 that Mr.\nand Mrs. Mirzayance\u2019s testimony could provide; and \u2018that they were\nabandoning their son.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 53\u201354 (same).\n8                    KNOWLES v.

Knowles v. Mirzayance,\n549 U. S. 1199 (2007). On remand, the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that its decision was unaffected by Musladin\nand again affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of habeas\ncorpus. App. 4. The Court of Appeals reiterated the same\nanalysis on which it had relied prior to this Court\u2019s re\nmand, again finding that the California court had unrea\nsonably applied clearly established federal law because\ndefense counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the insanity defense\nconstituted deficient performance as it \u201csecured . . . [n]o\nactual tactical advantage.\u201d Id., at 8. We granted certio\nrari, 554 U.

C. \u00a72254(d)(1), a federal\ncourt may not grant a state prisoner\u2019s habeas application\nunless the relevant state-court decision \u201cwas contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.\u201d2 Here, the relevant state-court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Before the Court of Appeals, Mirzayance contended that the stan\n\ndard of review set forth in \u00a72254(d)(1) should not apply to his case. See\nBrief for Appellee in No. 04\u201357102 (CA9), pp. 28\u201329, 33. Before this\nCourt, however, Mirzayance contends that the Court of Appeals cor\nrectly applied \u00a72254(d) to his claim. See Brief for Respondent 27, 32.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision is the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision deny\ning state habeas relief.\n  We conclude that the state court\u2019s decision to deny\nMirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim did\nnot violate clearly established federal law. The Court of\nAppeals reached a contrary result based, in large measure,\non its application of an improper standard of review\u2014it\nblamed counsel for abandoning the NGI claim because\nthere was nothing to lose by pursuing it.3 But this Court\nhas held on numerous occasions that it is not \u201c \u2018an unrea\nsonable application of clearly established Federal law\u2019 \u201d for\na state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMirzayance did question whether the California Court of Appeal\u2019s\ndenial of his claim should receive as much deference as the \u201cprototypi\ncal\u201d state-court adjudication \u201cinvolv[ing] both a reasoned, written\nopinion and an adequate development of the factual record in support\nof the claims.\u201d Id., at 33. Mirzayance thus contends that \u201cthe usual\n\u00a72254(d) deferential approach must be modified and adapted\u201d in\nevaluating his claim. Id., at 34. Nonetheless, because Mirzayance has\nnot argued that \u00a72254(d) is entirely inapplicable to his claim or that the\nstate court failed to reach an adjudication on the merits, we initially\nevaluate his claim through the deferential lens of \u00a72254(d). See United\nStates v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 855,\nn. 3 (1996) (finding that party abandoned issue by failing to address it\nin the party\u2019s brief on the merits); Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd. v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 513, 527 (1994) (same).\n  In addition, we do not decide whether the Court of Appeals was\ncorrect in finding that an evidentiary hearing on Mirzayance\u2019s claim\nwas required. See Mirzayance v. Hickman, 66 Fed. Appx. 676, 679\u2013681\n(CA9 2003). Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim fails\neven under the facts presented at the evidentiary hearing.\n   3 Although the Court of Appeals implicitly disavowed the \u201cnothing to\n\nlose\u201d standard applied by the District Court and Magistrate Judge, see\nApp. 5; Mirzayance v. Knowles, 175 Fed. Appx. 142, 143 (CA9 2006), it\nnevertheless concluded that \u201c[n]o actual tactical advantage was to be\ngained\u201d by counsel\u2019s withdrawal of the insanity defense, App. 8;\nKnowles, supra, at 144. Finding that counsel is deficient by abandon\ning a defense where there is nothing to gain from that abandonment is\nequivalent to finding that counsel is deficient by declining to pursue a\nstrategy where there is nothing to lose from pursuit of that strategy.\n10               KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhas not been squarely established by this Court. See\nWright v. Van Patten, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at\n5\u20136 (per curiam); Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 478\n(2007); Musladin, supra, at 76\u201377. This Court has never\nestablished anything akin to the Court of Appeals\u2019 \u201cnoth\ning to lose\u201d standard for evaluating Strickland claims.\nIndeed, Mirzayance himself acknowledges that a \u201cnothing\nto lose\u201d rule is \u201cunrecognized by this Court.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 28. And the Court of Appeals did not cite any\nSupreme Court decision establishing a \u201cnothing to lose\u201d\nstandard in any of its three opinions in this case. See App.\n3\u201312; Knowles, 175 Fed. Appx. 142; Hickman, 66 Fed.\nAppx. 676.\n   With no Supreme Court precedent establishing a \u201cnoth\ning to lose\u201d standard for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaims, habeas relief cannot be granted pursuant to\n\u00a72254(d)(1) based on such a standard. Instead, such relief\nmay be granted only if the state-court decision unreasona\nbly applied the more general standard for ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claims established by Strickland, in\nwhich this Court held that a defendant must show both\ndeficient performance and prejudice in order to prove that\nhe has received ineffective assistance of counsel, 466 U. S.,\nat 687. Indeed, this Court has repeatedly applied that\nstandard to evaluate ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaims where there is no other Supreme Court precedent\ndirectly on point. See, e.g., Van Patten, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 5) (evaluating claim under Strickland where no\nSupreme Court precedent established that any other\nstandard applied to the \u201cnovel factual context\u201d before the\nCourt); Schriro, supra, at 478 (evaluating claim under\ngeneral Strickland standard where no Supreme Court\nprecedent addressed the particular \u201csituation in which a\nclient interferes with counsel\u2019s efforts to present mitigat\ning evidence to a sentencing court\u201d).\n   The question \u201cis not whether a federal court believes the\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate court\u2019s determination\u201d under the Strickland stan\ndard \u201cwas incorrect but whether that determination was\nunreasonable\u2014a substantially higher threshold.\u201d Schriro,\nsupra, at 473. And, because the Strickland standard is a\ngeneral standard, a state court has even more latitude to\nreasonably determine that a defendant has not satisfied\nthat standard. See Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.\n652, 664 (2004) (\u201c[E]valuating whether a rule applica-\ntion was unreasonable requires considering the rule\u2019s\nspecificity. The more general the rule, the more lee-\nway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case\ndeterminations\u201d).\n   Under the doubly deferential judicial review that ap\nplies to a Strickland claim evaluated under the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) standard, see Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S.\n1, 5\u20136 (2003) (per curiam), Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\nassistance claim fails. It was not unreasonable for the\nstate court to conclude that his defense counsel\u2019s perform\nance was not deficient when he counseled Mirzayance to\nabandon a claim that stood almost no chance of success.\nAs explained more fully below, this Court has never re\nquired defense counsel to pursue every claim or defense,\nregardless of its merit, viability, or realistic chance for\nsuccess. See also infra, at 14\u201315.\n                            III\n   Even if Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim were eligible for de novo review, it would still fail.\nStrickland requires a defendant to establish deficient\nperformance and prejudice. 466 U. S., at 687. Mirzayance\ncan establish neither.\n   Mirzayance has not shown \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representa\ntion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d\nId., at 687\u2013688. \u201cThe proper measure of attorney per\nformance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.\u201d Id., at 688. \u201cJudicial scrutiny of\n12               KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential,\u201d and \u201ca\ncourt must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s\nconduct falls within the wide range of reasonable profes\nsional assistance.\u201d Id., at 689. \u201c[S]trategic choices made\nafter thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to\nplausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d Id., at\n690.\n  Here, Mirzayance has not shown that his counsel vio\nlated these standards. Rather, his counsel merely recom\nmended the withdrawal of what he reasonably believed\nwas a claim doomed to fail. The jury had already rejected\nmedical testimony about Mirzayance\u2019s mental state in the\nguilt phase, during which the State carried its burden of\nproving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Magistrate\nJudge explained this point:\n     \u201cAll [counsel] was left with were four experts, all of\n     whom reached a conclusion\u2014that [Mirzayance] did\n     not premeditate and deliberate his crime\u2014that the\n     same jury about to hear the NGI evidence already had\n     rejected under a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard\n     of proof. The experts were subject to other impeach\n     ment as well.\u201d App. 71.\nIn fact, the Magistrate Judge found that counsel \u201cconvinc\ningly detailed ways in which [the experts] could have been\nimpeached, for overlooking or minimizing facts which\nshowcased [Mirzayance\u2019s] clearly goal-directed behavior.\u201d\nId., at 70.\n  In the NGI phase, the burden would have switched to\nMirzayance to prove insanity by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Mirzayance\u2019s counsel reasonably believed that\nthere was almost no chance that the same jury would have\nreached a different result when considering similar evi\ndence, especially with Mirzayance bearing the burden of\nproof. Furthermore, counsel knew he would have had to\npresent this defense without the benefit of the parents\u2019\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntestimony, which he believed to be his strongest evidence.\nSee ibid. (\u201c[Counsel\u2019s] strategy at the NGI phase had been\nto appeal to the jury in one or both of two ways that de\npended entirely on the heartfelt participation of [Mir\nzayance\u2019s] parents as witnesses\u201d). Counsel reasonably\nconcluded that this defense was almost certain to lose.\n  The Court of Appeals took the position that the situation\nwas not quite so dire because the parents \u201cmerely ex\npressed reluctance to testify.\u201d Id., at 7; Knowles, 175 Fed.\nAppx., at 144. It explained that \u201c[c]ompetent counsel\nwould have attempted to persuade them to testify.\u201d App.\n7; Knowles, supra, at 144. But that holding is in tension\nwith the Magistrate Judge\u2019s findings and applies a more\ndemanding standard than Strickland prescribes. The\nMagistrate Judge noted that the parents \u201cconveyed the\nsame sense as a refusal.\u201d App. 72. Indeed, the Magistrate\nJudge found that the parents \u201cdid not testify later at\n[Mirzayance\u2019s] sentencing hearing\u201d because it \u201cwould have\nbeen \u2018too emotional\u2019 for them.\u201d Id., at 73 (quoting testi\nmony from evidentiary hearing). Competence does not\nrequire an attorney to browbeat a reluctant witness into\ntestifying, especially when the facts suggest that no\namount of persuasion would have succeeded. Counsel\u2019s\nacceptance of the parents\u2019 \u201cconvey[ance] [of] . . . a refusal,\u201d\nid., at 72, does not rise to the high bar for deficient per\nformance set by Strickland.\n  Mirzayance\u2019s failure to show ineffective assistance of\ncounsel is confirmed by the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding\nthat \u201c[counsel] carefully weighed his options before mak\ning his decision final; he did not make it rashly.\u201d App. 69.\nThe Magistrate Judge explained all of the factors that\ncounsel considered\u2014many of which are discussed above\u2014\nand noted that counsel \u201cdiscussed the situation with his\nexperienced co-counsel\u201d before making it. Id., at 71. In\nmaking this finding, the Magistrate Judge identified\ncounsel\u2019s decision as essentially an informed decision\n14                   KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cmade after thorough investigation of law and facts rele\nvant to plausible options.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.\nAs we stated in Strickland, such a decision is \u201cvirtually\nunchallengeable.\u201d Ibid.\n    Without even referring to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s find\ning, the Court of Appeals \u201cdisagree[d] that counsel\u2019s deci\nsion was carefully weighed and not made rashly.\u201d App. 7;\nKnowles, supra, at 144. In its view, \u201ccounsel acted on his\nsubjective feelings of hopelessness without even consider\ning the potential benefit to be gained in persisting with\nthe plea.\u201d App. 8; Knowles, supra, at 144\u2013145. But courts\nof appeals may not set aside a district court\u2019s factual\nfindings unless those findings are clearly erroneous. Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 52(a); Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S.\n564, 573\u2013574 (1985). Here, the Court of Appeals failed\neven to mention the clearly-erroneous standard, let alone\napply it, before effectively overturning the lower court\u2019s\nfactual findings related to counsel\u2019s behavior.\n    In light of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s factual findings, the\nstate court\u2019s rejection of Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim was consistent with Strick\nland. The Court of Appeals insisted, however, that\n\u201c \u2018[r]easonably effective assistance\u2019 required here that\ncounsel assert the only defense available . . . .\u201d App. 8; see\nalso Knowles, supra, at 145. But we are aware of no \u201cpre\nvailing professional norms\u201d that prevent counsel from\nrecommending that a plea be withdrawn when it is almost\ncertain to lose. See Strickland, supra, at 688. And in this\ncase, counsel did not give up \u201cthe only defense available.\u201d\nCounsel put on a defense to first-degree murder during the\nguilt phase. Counsel also defended his client at the sen\ntencing phase.4 The law does not require counsel to raise\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Mirzayance has no complaints about the sentencing phase since he\n\nreceived the lowest possible sentence for his first-degree murder convic\ntion. California authorizes three possible sentences for murder: death,\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

S.\n510, 533 (2003) (explaining, in case involving similar issue\nof counsel\u2019s responsibility to present mitigating evidence\nat sentencing, that \u201cStrickland does not require counsel to\ninvestigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence\nno matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the\ndefendant . . . [or even to] present mitigating evidence at\nsentencing in every case\u201d). Counsel also is not required to\nhave a tactical reason\u2014above and beyond a reasonable\nappraisal of a claim\u2019s dismal prospects for success\u2014for\nrecommending that a weak claim be dropped altogether.\nMirzayance has thus failed to demonstrate that his coun\nsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\n   In addition, Mirzayance has not demonstrated that he\nsuffered prejudice from his counsel\u2019s performance. See\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 691 (\u201cAn error by counsel, even if\nprofessionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting\naside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error\nhad no effect on the judgment\u201d). To establish prejudice,\n\u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different. A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to under\nmine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id., at 694. To prevail\non his ineffective-assistance claim, Mirzayance must show,\ntherefore, that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that he\nwould have prevailed on his insanity defense had he pur\nsued it. This Mirzayance cannot do. It was highly im\nprobable that a jury, which had just rejected testimony\nabout Mirzayance\u2019s mental condition when the State bore\nthe burden of proof, would have reached a different result\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nlife imprisonment without parole, and imprisonment for 25 years to life.\n\nCal.

Argued January 13, 2009\u2014Decided March 24, 2009\nRespondent Mirzayance entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by\n  reason of insanity (NGI) at his state-court murder trial. During the\n  guilt phase, he sought to avoid a conviction for first-degree murder\n  and instead obtain a second-degree murder verdict by presenting\n  medical testimony that he was insane at the time of the crime and\n  was, therefore, incapable of the necessary premeditation or delibera\n  tion. The jury nevertheless convicted him of first-degree murder. Af\n  ter the trial\u2019s NGI phase was scheduled, Mirzayance accepted his\n  counsel\u2019s recommendation to abandon the insanity plea. Counsel be\n  lieved that a defense verdict was unlikely because the jury had just\n  rejected medical testimony similar to that which would be presented\n  to establish the NGI defense. Moreover, although counsel had\n  planned to supplement the medical evidence with testimony by Mir\n  zayance\u2019s parents as to their son\u2019s mental illness, the parents refused\n  to testify at the last moment. Following his conviction, Mirzayance\n  alleged in state postconviction proceedings that his attorney\u2019s rec\n  ommendation to withdraw the NGI plea constituted ineffective assis\n  tance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668. The\n  trial court denied relief, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.\n     Mirzayance then applied for federal habeas relief, which the Dis\n  trict Court denied. The Ninth Circuit reversed, ordering an eviden\n  tiary hearing on counsel\u2019s recommendation to withdraw the NGI\n  plea. During the hearing, the Magistrate Judge made extensive fact\n  findings, including, inter alia, that the NGI phase medical evidence\n  essentially would have duplicated the evidence the jury rejected in\n  the guilt phase; that counsel doubted the likelihood of prevailing on\n  the NGI claim because the jury\u2019s finding of first-degree murder as a\n  practical matter would cripple Mirzayance\u2019s chances of convincing\n2                      KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the jury that he nevertheless was incapable of understanding the na\n    ture and quality of his act and of distinguishing right from wrong;\n    that Mirzayance\u2019s parents were not simply reluctant, but had effec\n    tively refused, to testify; that counsel had made a carefully reasoned\n    decision not to proceed with the NGI plea after weighing his options\n    and discussing the matter with experienced co-counsel; but that\n    counsel\u2019s performance was nevertheless deficient because Mirzayance\n    had \u201cnothing to lose\u201d by going forward with the NGI phase of the\n    trial. The Magistrate Judge also found prejudice and recommended\n    habeas relief. The District Court accepted the recommendation and\n    granted the writ. The Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling, among other\n    things, that counsel\u2019s performance had been deficient because Mir\n    zayance\u2019s parents had not refused, but had merely expressed reluc\n    tance to testify, and because competent counsel would have at\n    tempted to persuade them to testify, which Mirzayance\u2019s counsel\n    admittedly did not. The court essentially concluded that competent\n    counsel would have pursued the insanity defense because counsel\n    had nothing to lose by putting on the only defense available. In addi\n    tion, the court found prejudice because, in the court\u2019s view, there was\n    a reasonable probability the jury would have found Mirzayance in\n    sane had counsel pursued the NGI phase. The Ninth Circuit con\n    cluded that federal habeas relief was authorized under 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a72254(d)(1) because the California Court of Appeal had \u201cunreason\n    abl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law.\u201d\nHeld: Whether the state-court decision is reviewed under \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s\n standard or de novo, Mirzayance has failed to establish that his coun\n sel\u2019s performance was ineffective. Pp. 8\u201316.\n    (a) The State Court of Appeal\u2019s denial of Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\n assistance claim did not violate clearly established federal law. The\n Ninth Circuit reached a contrary result based largely on its applica\n tion of an improper review standard\u2014it blamed counsel for abandon\n ing the NGI claim because there was \u201cnothing to lose\u201d by pursuing it.\n But it is not \u201can unreasonable application of clearly established Fed\n eral law\u201d for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that\n has not been squarely established by this Court. See, e.g., Wright v.\n Van Patten, 552 U. S. ___, ___. Absent anything akin to the \u201cnothing\n to lose\u201d standard in this Court\u2019s precedent, habeas relief could have\n been granted under \u00a72254(d)(1) only if the state-court decision in this\n case had unreasonably applied Strickland\u2019s more general standard\n for ineffective-assistance claims, whereby a defendant must show\n both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice, 466 U. S., at\n 687. The question \u201cis not whether a federal court believes the state\n court\u2019s determination\u201d under Strickland \u201cwas incorrect but whether\n [it] was unreasonable\u2014a substantially higher threshold.\u201d Schriro v.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473. And, because Strickland\u2019s is a gen\n  eral standard, a state court has even more latitude to reasonably de\n  termine that a defendant has not satisfied that standard. Under the\n  doubly deferential judicial review that applies to a Strickland claim\n  evaluated under the \u00a72254(d)(1) standard, Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\n  assistance claim fails. It was not unreasonable for the state court to\n  conclude that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient when he coun\n  seled Mirzayance to abandon a claim that stood almost no chance of\n  success. Pp. 8\u201311.\n    (b) Even if Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim were eligible\n  for de novo review, it would still fail because he has not shown inef\n  fective assistance at all. Mirzayance can establish neither the defi\n  cient performance nor the prejudice required by Strickland. As to\n  performance, he has not shown \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell be\n  low an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d 466 U. S., at 687\u2013688.\n  Rather, counsel merely recommended the withdrawal of what he rea\n  sonably believed was a claim doomed because similar medical testi\n  mony had already been rejected and the parents\u2019 testimony, which he\n  believed to be his strongest evidence, would not be available. The\n  Ninth Circuit\u2019s position that competent counsel might have per\n  suaded the reluctant parents to testify is in tension with the Magis\n  trate Judge\u2019s contrary findings and applies a more demanding stan\n  dard than Strickland prescribes. The failure to show ineffective\n  assistance is also confirmed by the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that\n  counsel\u2019s decision was essentially an informed one \u201cmade after thor\n  ough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options,\u201d and\n  was therefore \u201cvirtually unchallengeable.\u201d Id., at 690. The Ninth\n  Circuit\u2019s insistence that counsel was required to assert the only de\n  fense available, even one almost certain to lose, is not supported by\n  any \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d of which the Court is aware. See\n  id., at 688. Nor has Mirzayance demonstrated that he suffered\n  prejudice, which requires a showing of \u201ca reasonable probability that,\n  but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\n  would have been different.\u201d See id., at 694. In fact, it was highly im\n  probable that the jury, having just rejected testimony about Mir\n  zayance\u2019s mental condition in the guilt phase, would have reached a\n  different result based on similar evidence at the NGI phase.

The California courts rejected this\nclaim on state postconviction review. We must decide\nwhether this decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of clearly established federal law. We hold\nthat it was not. Whether reviewed under the standard of\nreview set forth in \u00a72254(d)(1) or de novo, Mirzayance\nfailed to establish that his counsel\u2019s performance was\nineffective, see Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join all but\nPart II of this opinion.\n2                KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n  Mirzayance confessed that he stabbed his 19-year-old\ncousin nine times with a hunting knife and then shot her\nfour times. At trial, he entered pleas of not guilty and not\nguilty by reason of insanity (NGI). Under California law,\nwhen both of these pleas are entered, the court must hold\na bifurcated trial, with guilt determined during the first\nphase and the viability of the defendant\u2019s NGI plea during\nthe second. Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71026(a) (West 1985).\nDuring the guilt phase of Mirzayance\u2019s trial, he sought to\navoid a conviction for first-degree murder by obtaining a\nverdict on the lesser included offense of second-degree\nmurder. To that end, he presented medical testimony that\nhe was insane at the time of the crime and was, therefore,\nincapable of the premeditation or deliberation necessary\nfor a first-degree murder conviction. The jury neverthe\nless convicted Mirzayance of first-degree murder.\n  The trial judge set the NGI phase to begin the day after\nthe conviction was entered but, on the advice of counsel,\nMirzayance abandoned his NGI plea before it commenced.\nHe would have borne the burden of proving his insanity\nduring the NGI phase to the same jury that had just con\nvicted him of first-degree murder. Counsel had planned to\nmeet that burden by presenting medical testimony similar\nto that presented in the guilt phase, including evidence\nthat Mirzayance was insane and incapable of premeditat\ning or deliberating. Because the jury rejected similar\nevidence at the guilt phase (where the State bore the\nburden of proof), counsel believed a defense verdict at the\nNGI phase (where the burden was on the defendant) was\nunlikely. He planned, though, to have Mirzayance\u2019s par\nents testify and thus provide an emotional account of\nMirzayance\u2019s struggles with mental illness to supplement\nthe medical evidence of insanity. But on the morning that\nthe NGI phase was set to begin, Mirzayance\u2019s parents\nrefused to testify. After consulting with co-counsel, coun\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsel advised Mirzayance that he should withdraw the NGI\nplea. Mirzayance accepted the advice.\n   After he was sentenced, Mirzayance challenged his\nconviction in state postconviction proceedings. Among\nother allegations, he claimed that counsel\u2019s recommenda\ntion to withdraw the NGI plea constituted ineffective\nassistance of counsel under Strickland. The California\ntrial court denied the petition and the California Court of\nAppeal affirmed without offering any reason for its rejec\ntion of this particular ineffective assistance claim.

B116856, B124764 (Mar. 31, 1999),\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 165\u2013167, 200\u2013201 (hereinafter App.).\nMirzayance then filed an application for federal habeas\nrelief under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254, which the District Court\ndenied without an evidentiary hearing. The Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court and ordered an evi\ndentiary hearing on counsel\u2019s recommendation to with\ndraw the NGI plea. Mirzayance v. Hickman, 66 Fed.\nAppx. 676, 679\u2013681 (CA9 2003). During that evidentiary\nhearing, a Magistrate Judge made factual findings that\nthe District Court later adopted. Post-Remand Report and\nRecommendation of United States Magistrate Judge in\nNo. CV 00\u201301388 DT (RZ) (CD Cal.), App. 38, 68; Mir\nzayance v. Knowles, No. CV 00\u20131388 DT (RZ) (CD Cal.,\nNov. 15, 2004), id., at 35\u201336.\n   According to the Magistrate Judge, counsel\u2019s strategy\nfor the two-part trial was to seek a second-degree murder\nverdict in the first stage and to seek an NGI verdict in the\nsecond stage. This strategy faltered when the jury instead\nconvicted Mirzayance of first-degree murder. In the cir\ncumstances of this case, the medical evidence that Mir\nzayance planned to adduce at the NGI phase essentially\nwould have duplicated evidence that the jury had neces\nsarily rejected in the guilt phase. First-degree murder in\nCalifornia includes any killing that is \u201cwillful, deliberate,\nand premeditated.\u201d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7189 (West\n4                 KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1999). To prove NGI, a defendant must show that he was\nincapable of knowing or understanding the nature of his\nact or of distinguishing right from wrong at the time of the\noffense. See People v.

Highlighting this potential contra\ndiction, the trial judge instructed the jury during the guilt\nphase that \u201c[t]he word \u2018deliberate,\u2019 \u201d as required for a first\ndegree murder conviction, \u201cmeans formed or arrived at or\ndetermined upon as a result of careful thought and weigh\ning of considerations for and against the proposed course\nof action.\u201d App. 48\u201349.\n   When the jury found Mirzayance guilty of first-degree\nmurder, counsel doubted the likelihood of prevailing on\nthe NGI claim. According to the Magistrate Judge:\n    \u201cThe defense suspected that a jury\u2019s finding, beyond a\n    reasonable doubt, that [Mirzayance] had \u2018deliberated\u2019\n    and \u2018premeditated\u2019 his killing of [the victim] as a prac\n    tical matter would cripple [Mirzayance\u2019s] chances of\n    convincing the jury later, during the sanity phase,\n    that [Mirzayance] nevertheless \u2018was incapable of\n    knowing or understanding the nature and quality of\n    his . . . act and of distinguishing right from wrong at\n    the time of the commission of the offense,\u2019 Cal.

[it]\n    would have been \u2018too emotional\u2019 for them. . . . If weeks\n    after the guilty verdict and the withdrawal of their\n    son\u2019s NGI plea, [Mirzayance\u2019s] parents\u2019 emotions still\n    prevented them from testifying at the sentencing\n    hearing, then surely those emotional obstacles to their\n    testifying in the NGI phase would have been at least\n    as potent, and probably more so.\u201d Id., at 73 (emphasis\n    in original).\n  The Magistrate Judge found that counsel made a care\nfully reasoned decision not to go forward with the NGI\nplea:\n    \u201c[Counsel] carefully weighed his options before mak\n    ing his decision final; he did not make it rashly. . . .\n    [Counsel\u2019s] strategy at the NGI phase . . . depended\n    entirely on the heartfelt participation of [Mir\n    zayance\u2019s] parents as witnesses. . . .

[Counsel] discussed the situation with his\n    experienced co-counsel . . . who concurred in [coun\n    sel\u2019s] proposal that he recommend to [Mirzayance] the\n    withdrawal of the NGI plea.\u201d Id., at 69\u201371.\nBased on these factual findings, the Magistrate Judge\nstated that, in his view, counsel\u2019s performance was not\ndeficient.\n    Despite this determination, the Magistrate Judge con\ncluded that the court was bound by the Court of Appeals\u2019\nremand order to determine only whether \u201c \u2018there were\ntactical reasons for abandoning the insanity defense.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 98 (quoting Hickman, 66 Fed. Appx., at 680). Even\nthough the Magistrate Judge thought that counsel was\nreasonable in recommending that a very weak claim be\ndropped, the Magistrate Judge understood the remand\norder to mean that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient if\nwithdrawing the NGI plea would achieve no tactical ad\nvantage. The Magistrate Judge found that \u201c[Mirzayance]\nhad nothing to lose\u201d by going forward with the NGI phase\nof the trial, App. 100, and thus held, under the remand\norder, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, ibid. As\nto prejudice, the Magistrate Judge concluded the court\nwas similarly bound by the remand order because the\nCourt of Appeals described the NGI defense as remaining\n\u201c \u2018viable and strong.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 98 (quoting Hickman, supra,\nat 681). Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge found preju\ndice and recommended granting the writ of habeas corpus.\nThe District Court accepted this recommendation and\ngranted the writ.\n    The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Ibid.; App. 98\u201399.\nNonetheless, the Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of\ndeficient performance.

S. 70\n(2006), which held that a state court had not \u201c \u2018unreason\nabl[y] appli[ed] clearly established Federal law\u2019 \u201d when it\ndeclined to apply our precedent concerning state\nsponsored courtroom practices to a case involving specta\ntor conduct at trial, id., at 76\u201377. Knowles v. Mirzayance,\n549 U. S. 1199 (2007). On remand, the Court of Appeals\nconcluded that its decision was unaffected by Musladin\nand again affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of habeas\ncorpus. App. 4. The Court of Appeals reiterated the same\nanalysis on which it had relied prior to this Court\u2019s re\nmand, again finding that the California court had unrea\nsonably applied clearly established federal law because\ndefense counsel\u2019s failure to pursue the insanity defense\nconstituted deficient performance as it \u201csecured . . . [n]o\nactual tactical advantage.\u201d Id., at 8. We granted certio\nrari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                            II\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), a federal\ncourt may not grant a state prisoner\u2019s habeas application\nunless the relevant state-court decision \u201cwas contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.\u201d2 Here, the relevant state-court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Before the Court of Appeals, Mirzayance contended that the stan\n\ndard of review set forth in \u00a72254(d)(1) should not apply to his case. See\nBrief for Appellee in No. 04\u201357102 (CA9), pp. 28\u201329, 33. Before this\nCourt, however, Mirzayance contends that the Court of Appeals cor\nrectly applied \u00a72254(d) to his claim. See Brief for Respondent 27, 32.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision is the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision deny\ning state habeas relief.\n  We conclude that the state court\u2019s decision to deny\nMirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim did\nnot violate clearly established federal law. The Court of\nAppeals reached a contrary result based, in large measure,\non its application of an improper standard of review\u2014it\nblamed counsel for abandoning the NGI claim because\nthere was nothing to lose by pursuing it.3 But this Court\nhas held on numerous occasions that it is not \u201c \u2018an unrea\nsonable application of clearly established Federal law\u2019 \u201d for\na state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMirzayance did question whether the California Court of Appeal\u2019s\ndenial of his claim should receive as much deference as the \u201cprototypi\ncal\u201d state-court adjudication \u201cinvolv[ing] both a reasoned, written\nopinion and an adequate development of the factual record in support\nof the claims.\u201d Id., at 33. Mirzayance thus contends that \u201cthe usual\n\u00a72254(d) deferential approach must be modified and adapted\u201d in\nevaluating his claim. Id., at 34. Nonetheless, because Mirzayance has\nnot argued that \u00a72254(d) is entirely inapplicable to his claim or that the\nstate court failed to reach an adjudication on the merits, we initially\nevaluate his claim through the deferential lens of \u00a72254(d). See United\nStates v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 855,\nn. 3 (1996) (finding that party abandoned issue by failing to address it\nin the party\u2019s brief on the merits); Posters \u2018N\u2019 Things, Ltd. v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 513, 527 (1994) (same).\n  In addition, we do not decide whether the Court of Appeals was\ncorrect in finding that an evidentiary hearing on Mirzayance\u2019s claim\nwas required. See Mirzayance v. Hickman, 66 Fed. Appx. 676, 679\u2013681\n(CA9 2003). Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim fails\neven under the facts presented at the evidentiary hearing.\n   3 Although the Court of Appeals implicitly disavowed the \u201cnothing to\n\nlose\u201d standard applied by the District Court and Magistrate Judge, see\nApp. 5; Mirzayance v. Knowles, 175 Fed. Appx. 142, 143 (CA9 2006), it\nnevertheless concluded that \u201c[n]o actual tactical advantage was to be\ngained\u201d by counsel\u2019s withdrawal of the insanity defense, App. 8;\nKnowles, supra, at 144. Finding that counsel is deficient by abandon\ning a defense where there is nothing to gain from that abandonment is\nequivalent to finding that counsel is deficient by declining to pursue a\nstrategy where there is nothing to lose from pursuit of that strategy.\n10               KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhas not been squarely established by this Court. See\nWright v. Van Patten, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at\n5\u20136 (per curiam); Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 478\n(2007); Musladin, supra, at 76\u201377. This Court has never\nestablished anything akin to the Court of Appeals\u2019 \u201cnoth\ning to lose\u201d standard for evaluating Strickland claims.\nIndeed, Mirzayance himself acknowledges that a \u201cnothing\nto lose\u201d rule is \u201cunrecognized by this Court.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 28. And the Court of Appeals did not cite any\nSupreme Court decision establishing a \u201cnothing to lose\u201d\nstandard in any of its three opinions in this case. See App.\n3\u201312; Knowles, 175 Fed. Appx. 142; Hickman, 66 Fed.\nAppx. 676.\n   With no Supreme Court precedent establishing a \u201cnoth\ning to lose\u201d standard for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaims, habeas relief cannot be granted pursuant to\n\u00a72254(d)(1) based on such a standard. Instead, such relief\nmay be granted only if the state-court decision unreasona\nbly applied the more general standard for ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claims established by Strickland, in\nwhich this Court held that a defendant must show both\ndeficient performance and prejudice in order to prove that\nhe has received ineffective assistance of counsel, 466 U. S.,\nat 687. Indeed, this Court has repeatedly applied that\nstandard to evaluate ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaims where there is no other Supreme Court precedent\ndirectly on point. See, e.g., Van Patten, supra, at ___ (slip\nop., at 5) (evaluating claim under Strickland where no\nSupreme Court precedent established that any other\nstandard applied to the \u201cnovel factual context\u201d before the\nCourt); Schriro, supra, at 478 (evaluating claim under\ngeneral Strickland standard where no Supreme Court\nprecedent addressed the particular \u201csituation in which a\nclient interferes with counsel\u2019s efforts to present mitigat\ning evidence to a sentencing court\u201d).\n   The question \u201cis not whether a federal court believes the\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate court\u2019s determination\u201d under the Strickland stan\ndard \u201cwas incorrect but whether that determination was\nunreasonable\u2014a substantially higher threshold.\u201d Schriro,\nsupra, at 473. And, because the Strickland standard is a\ngeneral standard, a state court has even more latitude to\nreasonably determine that a defendant has not satisfied\nthat standard. See Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S.\n652, 664 (2004) (\u201c[E]valuating whether a rule applica-\ntion was unreasonable requires considering the rule\u2019s\nspecificity. The more general the rule, the more lee-\nway courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case\ndeterminations\u201d).\n   Under the doubly deferential judicial review that ap\nplies to a Strickland claim evaluated under the\n\u00a72254(d)(1) standard, see Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S.\n1, 5\u20136 (2003) (per curiam), Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\nassistance claim fails. It was not unreasonable for the\nstate court to conclude that his defense counsel\u2019s perform\nance was not deficient when he counseled Mirzayance to\nabandon a claim that stood almost no chance of success.\nAs explained more fully below, this Court has never re\nquired defense counsel to pursue every claim or defense,\nregardless of its merit, viability, or realistic chance for\nsuccess. See also infra, at 14\u201315.\n                            III\n   Even if Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim were eligible for de novo review, it would still fail.\nStrickland requires a defendant to establish deficient\nperformance and prejudice. 466 U. S., at 687. Mirzayance\ncan establish neither.\n   Mirzayance has not shown \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representa\ntion fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d\nId., at 687\u2013688. \u201cThe proper measure of attorney per\nformance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.\u201d Id., at 688. \u201cJudicial scrutiny of\n12               KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential,\u201d and \u201ca\ncourt must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s\nconduct falls within the wide range of reasonable profes\nsional assistance.\u201d Id., at 689. \u201c[S]trategic choices made\nafter thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to\nplausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d Id., at\n690.\n  Here, Mirzayance has not shown that his counsel vio\nlated these standards. Rather, his counsel merely recom\nmended the withdrawal of what he reasonably believed\nwas a claim doomed to fail. The jury had already rejected\nmedical testimony about Mirzayance\u2019s mental state in the\nguilt phase, during which the State carried its burden of\nproving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Magistrate\nJudge explained this point:\n     \u201cAll [counsel] was left with were four experts, all of\n     whom reached a conclusion\u2014that [Mirzayance] did\n     not premeditate and deliberate his crime\u2014that the\n     same jury about to hear the NGI evidence already had\n     rejected under a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard\n     of proof. The experts were subject to other impeach\n     ment as well.\u201d App. 71.\nIn fact, the Magistrate Judge found that counsel \u201cconvinc\ningly detailed ways in which [the experts] could have been\nimpeached, for overlooking or minimizing facts which\nshowcased [Mirzayance\u2019s] clearly goal-directed behavior.\u201d\nId., at 70.\n  In the NGI phase, the burden would have switched to\nMirzayance to prove insanity by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Mirzayance\u2019s counsel reasonably believed that\nthere was almost no chance that the same jury would have\nreached a different result when considering similar evi\ndence, especially with Mirzayance bearing the burden of\nproof. Furthermore, counsel knew he would have had to\npresent this defense without the benefit of the parents\u2019\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntestimony, which he believed to be his strongest evidence.\nSee ibid. (\u201c[Counsel\u2019s] strategy at the NGI phase had been\nto appeal to the jury in one or both of two ways that de\npended entirely on the heartfelt participation of [Mir\nzayance\u2019s] parents as witnesses\u201d). Counsel reasonably\nconcluded that this defense was almost certain to lose.\n  The Court of Appeals took the position that the situation\nwas not quite so dire because the parents \u201cmerely ex\npressed reluctance to testify.\u201d Id., at 7; Knowles, 175 Fed.\nAppx., at 144. It explained that \u201c[c]ompetent counsel\nwould have attempted to persuade them to testify.\u201d App.\n7; Knowles, supra, at 144. But that holding is in tension\nwith the Magistrate Judge\u2019s findings and applies a more\ndemanding standard than Strickland prescribes. The\nMagistrate Judge noted that the parents \u201cconveyed the\nsame sense as a refusal.\u201d App. 72. Indeed, the Magistrate\nJudge found that the parents \u201cdid not testify later at\n[Mirzayance\u2019s] sentencing hearing\u201d because it \u201cwould have\nbeen \u2018too emotional\u2019 for them.\u201d Id., at 73 (quoting testi\nmony from evidentiary hearing). Competence does not\nrequire an attorney to browbeat a reluctant witness into\ntestifying, especially when the facts suggest that no\namount of persuasion would have succeeded. Counsel\u2019s\nacceptance of the parents\u2019 \u201cconvey[ance] [of] . . . a refusal,\u201d\nid., at 72, does not rise to the high bar for deficient per\nformance set by Strickland.\n  Mirzayance\u2019s failure to show ineffective assistance of\ncounsel is confirmed by the Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding\nthat \u201c[counsel] carefully weighed his options before mak\ning his decision final; he did not make it rashly.\u201d App. 69.\nThe Magistrate Judge explained all of the factors that\ncounsel considered\u2014many of which are discussed above\u2014\nand noted that counsel \u201cdiscussed the situation with his\nexperienced co-counsel\u201d before making it. Id., at 71. In\nmaking this finding, the Magistrate Judge identified\ncounsel\u2019s decision as essentially an informed decision\n14                   KNOWLES v. MIRZAYANCE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cmade after thorough investigation of law and facts rele\nvant to plausible options.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690.\nAs we stated in Strickland, such a decision is \u201cvirtually\nunchallengeable.\u201d Ibid.\n    Without even referring to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s find\ning, the Court of Appeals \u201cdisagree[d] that counsel\u2019s deci\nsion was carefully weighed and not made rashly.\u201d App. 7;\nKnowles, supra, at 144. In its view, \u201ccounsel acted on his\nsubjective feelings of hopelessness without even consider\ning the potential benefit to be gained in persisting with\nthe plea.\u201d App. 8; Knowles, supra, at 144\u2013145. But courts\nof appeals may not set aside a district court\u2019s factual\nfindings unless those findings are clearly erroneous. Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 52(a); Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S.\n564, 573\u2013574 (1985). Here, the Court of Appeals failed\neven to mention the clearly-erroneous standard, let alone\napply it, before effectively overturning the lower court\u2019s\nfactual findings related to counsel\u2019s behavior.\n    In light of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s factual findings, the\nstate court\u2019s rejection of Mirzayance\u2019s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim was consistent with Strick\nland. The Court of Appeals insisted, however, that\n\u201c \u2018[r]easonably effective assistance\u2019 required here that\ncounsel assert the only defense available . . . .\u201d App. 8; see\nalso Knowles, supra, at 145. But we are aware of no \u201cpre\nvailing professional norms\u201d that prevent counsel from\nrecommending that a plea be withdrawn when it is almost\ncertain to lose. See Strickland, supra, at 688. And in this\ncase, counsel did not give up \u201cthe only defense available.\u201d\nCounsel put on a defense to first-degree murder during the\nguilt phase. Counsel also defended his client at the sen\ntencing phase.4 The law does not require counsel to raise\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Mirzayance has no complaints about the sentencing phase since he\n\nreceived the lowest possible sentence for his first-degree murder convic\ntion. California authorizes three possible sentences for murder: death,\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nevery available nonfrivolous defense. See Jones v. Barnes,\n463 U. S. 745, 751 (1983); cf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S.\n510, 533 (2003) (explaining, in case involving similar issue\nof counsel\u2019s responsibility to present mitigating evidence\nat sentencing, that \u201cStrickland does not require counsel to\ninvestigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence\nno matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the\ndefendant . . . [or even to] present mitigating evidence at\nsentencing in every case\u201d). Counsel also is not required to\nhave a tactical reason\u2014above and beyond a reasonable\nappraisal of a claim\u2019s dismal prospects for success\u2014for\nrecommending that a weak claim be dropped altogether.\nMirzayance has thus failed to demonstrate that his coun\nsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\n   In addition, Mirzayance has not demonstrated that he\nsuffered prejudice from his counsel\u2019s performance. See\nStrickland, 466 U. S., at 691 (\u201cAn error by counsel, even if\nprofessionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting\naside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error\nhad no effect on the judgment\u201d). To establish prejudice,\n\u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different. A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to under\nmine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id., at 694. To prevail\non his ineffective-assistance claim, Mirzayance must show,\ntherefore, that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that he\nwould have prevailed on his insanity defense had he pur\nsued it. This Mirzayance cannot do. It was highly im\nprobable that a jury, which had just rejected testimony\nabout Mirzayance\u2019s mental condition when the State bore\nthe burden of proof, would have reached a different result\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nlife imprisonment without parole, and imprisonment for 25 years to life.\n\nCal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7190(a) (West 1999). Mirzayance was sentenced\n\nto 25 years to life plus 4 years for a weapons enhancement. \n\n16              KNOWLES v.
