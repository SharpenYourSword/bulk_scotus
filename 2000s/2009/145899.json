Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n                         VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VERMONT\n\n     No. 08\u201388. Argued January 13, 2009\u2014Decided March 9, 2009\nIn July 2001, respondent Brillon was arrested on felony domestic as\n  sault and habitual offender charges. Nearly three years later, in\n  June 2004, he was tried by jury, found guilty as charged, and sen\n  tenced to 12 to 20 years in prison. During the time between his ar\n  rest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to\n  represent him. Brillon \u201cfired\u201d his first attorney, who served from\n  July 2001 to February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\n  March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he re\n  ported that Brillon had threatened his life. His fourth lawyer served\n  from June 2002 until November 2002, when the trial court released\n  him from the case. His fifth lawyer, assigned two months later,\n  withdrew in April 2003. Four months thereafter, his sixth lawyer\n  was assigned, and she took the case to trial in June 2004.\n     The trial court denied Brillon\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of a\n  speedy trial. The Vermont Supreme Court, however, reversed, hold\n  ing that Brillon\u2019s conviction must be vacated, and the charges against\n  him dismissed, because the State did not accord him the speedy trial\n  required by the Sixth Amendment. Citing the balancing test this\n  Court stated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, the Vermont Su\n  preme Court concluded that all four factors described in Barker\u2014\n  \u201c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion\n  of his right, and prejudice to the defendant,\u201d id., at 530\u2014weighed\n  against the State. Weighing heavily in Brillon\u2019s favor, the Vermont\n  court said, the three-year delay in bringing him to trial was \u201cex\n  treme.\u201d In assessing the reasons for that delay, the court separately\n  considered the period of each counsel\u2019s representation. It acknowl\n  edged that the first year, when Brillon was represented by his first\n  and third lawyers, should not count against the State. But the court\n  counted much of the remaining two years against the State. Delays\n2                        VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    in that period, the court determined, were caused, for the most part,\n    by the failure or unwillingness of several of the assigned counsel,\n    over an inordinate period of time, to move the case forward. As for\n    the third and fourth Barker v. Wingo factors, the court found that\n    Brillon repeatedly and adamantly demanded a trial and that his\n    lengthy pretrial incarceration was prejudicial.\nHeld: The Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel\n essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system. Assigned\n counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and\n delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defen\n dants they represent. Pp. 6\u201311.\n    (a) Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in Brillon\u2019s\n trial. In applying Barker, the Court has asked \u201cwhether the govern\n ment or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.\u201d\n Doggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651. Delay \u201cto hamper the\n defense\u201d weighs heavily against the prosecution, Barker, 407 U. S., at\n 531, while delay caused by the defense weighs against the defendant,\n id., at 529. Because \u201cthe attorney is the [defendant\u2019s] agent when\n acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,\u201d delay caused\n by the defendant\u2019s counsel is charged against the defendant. Cole\n man v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753. The same principle applies\n whether counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n \u201c \u2018[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an accused,\n the duties and obligations are the same whether the lawyer is pri\n vately retained, appointed, or serving in a legal aid or defender pro\n gram.\u2019 \u201d Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 318. Unlike a prose\n cutor or the court, assigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a\n state actor. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Although the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily would\n not prompt this Court\u2019s review, the Vermont Supreme Court made a\n fundamental error in its application of Barker that calls for this\n Court\u2019s correction. The court erred in attributing to the State delays\n caused by the failure of several assigned counsel to move Brillon\u2019s\n case forward and in failing adequately to take into account the role of\n Brillon\u2019s disruptive behavior in the overall balance. Pp. 8\u201311.\n       (1) An assigned counsel\u2019s failure to move the case forward does\n not warrant attribution of delay to the State. Most of the delay the\n Vermont court attributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\n Brillon as delays caused by his counsel, each of whom requested time\n extensions. Their inability or unwillingness to move the case forward\n may not be attributed to the State simply because they are assigned\n counsel. A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed counsel to\n delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continuances, hoping\n thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  grounds. Trial courts might well respond by viewing continuance re\n  quests made by appointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that\n  even an apparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\n  tactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a privately re\n  tained counsel\u2019s requests for time extensions. There is no justifica\n  tion for treating defendants\u2019 speedy-trial claims differently based on\n  whether their counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned.\n  Pp. 9\u201310.\n        (2) The Vermont Supreme Court further erred by treating the\n  period of each counsel\u2019s representation discretely. The court failed\n  appropriately to take into account Brillon\u2019s role during the first year\n  of delay. Brillon sought to dismiss his first attorney on the eve of\n  trial. His strident, aggressive behavior with regard to his third at\n  torney further impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult\n  for the Defender General\u2019s office to find replacement counsel. Absent\n  Brillon\u2019s efforts to force the withdrawal of his first and third attor\n  neys, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen. Pp. 10\u201311.\n     (c) The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by\n  assigned counsel is not absolute. Delay resulting from a systemic\n  breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the\n  State. Cf. Polk County, 454 U. S., at 324\u2013325. But the Vermont Su\n  preme Court made no determination, and nothing in the record sug\n  gests, that institutional problems caused any part of the delay in\n  Brillon\u2019s case.

MICHAEL BRILLON\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      VERMONT\n\n                                 [March 9, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the Sixth Amendment guarantee\nthat \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\nthe right to a speedy . . . trial.\u201d Michael Brillon, defendant\nbelow, respondent here, was arrested in July 2001 on\nfelony domestic assault and habitual offender charges.\nNearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by\njury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20\nyears in prison. The Vermont Supreme Court vacated\nBrillon\u2019s conviction and held that the charges against him\nmust be dismissed because he had been denied his right to\na speedy trial.\n   During the time between Brillon\u2019s arrest and his trial,\nat least six different attorneys were appointed to represent\nhim. Brillon \u201cfired\u201d the first, who served from July 2001\nto February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\nMarch 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw\nwhen he reported that Brillon had threatened his life. The\nVermont Supreme Court charged against Brillon the\ndelays associated with those periods, but charged against\nthe State periods in which assigned counsel failed \u201cto\nmove the case forward.\u201d 955 A. 2d 1108, 1121, 1122\n2                     VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(2008).\n  We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in\nranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the\ncriminal justice system. Assigned counsel, just as retained\ncounsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by\ncounsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they\nrepresent. For a total of some six months of the time that\nelapsed between Brillon\u2019s arrest and his trial, Brillon\nlacked an attorney. The State may be charged with those\nmonths if the gaps resulted from the trial court\u2019s failure to\nappoint replacement counsel with dispatch. Similarly, the\nState may bear responsibility if there is \u201ca breakdown in\nthe public defender system.\u201d Id., at 1111. But, as the\nVermont Supreme Court acknowledged, id., at 1126, the\nrecord does not establish any such institutional break\u00ad\ndown.\n                              I\n   On July 27, 2001, Michael Brillon was arrested after\nstriking his girlfriend. Three days later he was arraigned\nin state court in Bennington County, Vermont and\ncharged with felony domestic assault. His alleged status\nas a habitual offender exposed him to a potential life\nsentence. The court ordered him held without bail.\n   Richard Ammons, from the county public defender\u2019s\noffice, was assigned on the day of arraignment as Brillon\u2019s\nfirst counsel.1 In October, Ammons filed a motion to\nrecuse the trial judge. It was denied the next month and\ntrial was scheduled for February 2002. In mid-January,\nAmmons moved for a continuance, but the State objected,\nand the trial court denied the motion.\n   On February 22, four days before the jury draw, Am\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Vermont\u2019s\n              Defender General has \u201cthe primary responsibility for\nproviding needy persons with legal services.\u201d Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13,\n\u00a75253(a) (1998). These services may be provided \u201cpersonally, through\npublic defenders,\u201d or through contract attorneys.

S. ____ (2009)                       3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmons again moved for a continuance, citing his heavy\nworkload and the need for further investigation. Ammons\nacknowledged that any delay would not count (presumably\nagainst the State) for speedy-trial purposes. The State\nopposed the motion,2 and at the conclusion of a hearing,\nthe trial court denied it. Brillon, participating in the\nproceedings through interactive television, then an\u00ad\nnounced: \u201cYou\u2019re fired, Rick.\u201d App. 187. Three days later,\nthe trial court\u2014over the State\u2019s objection\u2014granted Am\u00ad\nmons\u2019 motion to withdraw as counsel, citing Brillon\u2019s\ntermination of Ammons and Ammons\u2019 statement that he\ncould no longer zealously represent Brillon.3 The trial\ncourt warned Brillon that further delay would occur while\na new attorney became familiar with the case. The same\nday, the trial court appointed a second attorney, but he\nimmediately withdrew based on a conflict.\n  On March 1, 2002, Gerard Altieri was assigned as Bril\u00ad\nlon\u2019s third counsel. On May 20, Brillon filed a motion to\ndismiss Altieri for, among other reasons, failure to file\nmotions, \u201c[v]irtually no communication whatsoever,\u201d and\nhis lack of diligence \u201cbecause of heavy case load.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b62,\n5, at 113\u2013114. At a June 11 hearing, Altieri denied sev\u00ad\neral of Brillon\u2019s allegations, noted his disagreement with\nBrillon\u2019s trial strategy,4 and insisted he had plenty of time\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The State expressed its concern that the continuance request was\n\n\u201cjust part and parcel of an effort by the defense to have the Court not\nhear this matter.\u201d App. 180. Under Vermont procedures, the judge\npresiding over the trial was scheduled to \u201crotate\u201d out of the county\nwhere Brillon\u2019s case was pending in March 2002. See id., \u00b66, at 109.\nThus, a continuance past March would have caused a different judge to\npreside over Brillon\u2019s trial, despite the denial of his motion to recuse\nthe initial judge. Ammons requested a continuance until April.\n   3 Ammons also cited as cause to withdraw, \u201ccertain irreconcilable\n\ndifferences in preferred approach between Mr. Brillon and counsel as to\ntrial strategy, as well as other legitimate legal decisions.\u201d Id., \u00b62, at\n104.\n   4 Specifically, Altieri appeared reluctant to follow Brillon\u2019s tactic that\n4                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto prepare. The State opposed Brillon\u2019s motion as well.\nNear the end of the hearing, however, Altieri moved to\nwithdraw on the ground that Brillon had threatened his\nlife during a break in the proceedings. The trial court\ngranted Brillon\u2019s motion to dismiss Altieri, but warned\nBrillon that \u201cthis is somewhat of a dubious victory in your\ncase because it simply prolongs the time that you will\nremain in jail until we can bring this matter to trial.\u201d Id.,\nat 226.\n   That same day, the trial court appointed Paul\nDonaldson as Brillon\u2019s fourth counsel. At an August 5\nstatus conference, Donaldson requested additional time to\nconduct discovery in light of his caseload. A few weeks\nlater, Brillon sent a letter to the court complaining about\nDonaldson\u2019s unresponsiveness and lack of competence.\nTwo months later, Brillon filed a motion to dismiss\nDonaldson\u2014similar to his motion to dismiss Altieri\u2014for\nfailure to file motions and \u201cvirtually no communication\nwhatsoever.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b61, 2, at 115\u2013116. At a November 26\nhearing, Donaldson reported that his contract with the\nDefender General\u2019s office had expired in June and that he\nhad been in discussions to have Brillon\u2019s case reassigned.\nThe trial court released Donaldson from the case\n\u201c[w]ithout making any findings regarding the adequacy of\n[Donaldson]\u2019s representation.\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1119. Cf.\npost, at 2.\n   Brillon\u2019s fifth counsel, David Sleigh, was not assigned\nuntil January 15, 2003; Brillon was without counsel dur\u00ad\ning the intervening two months. On February 25, Sleigh\nsought extensions of various discovery deadlines, noting\nthat he had been in trial out of town. App. 117. On April\n10, however, Sleigh withdrew from the case, based on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nhe \u201cbring in a lot of people\u201d at trial, \u201csome of them young kids and \n\nrelatives . . . in an attempt by Mr. Brillon\u2014this is his theory\u2014I don\u2019t\n\nwant to use the words trash, [to] impeach [the victim].\u201d Id., at 216\u2013217. \n\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

On June 20, the Defender General\u2019s office noti\u00ad\nfied the court that it had received \u201cfunding from the legis\u00ad\nlature\u201d and would hire a new special felony unit defender\nfor Brillon. Id., at 159. On August 1, Kathleen Moore was\nappointed as Brillon\u2019s sixth counsel. The trial court set\nNovember 7 as the deadline for motions, but granted\nseveral extensions in accord with the parties\u2019 stipulation.\nOn February 23, 2004, Moore filed a motion to dismiss for\nlack of a speedy trial. The trial court denied the motion on\nApril 19.\n   The case finally went to trial on June 14, 2004. Brillon\nwas found guilty and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.\nThe trial court denied a post-trial motion to dismiss for\nwant of a speedy trial, concluding that the delay in Bril\u00ad\nlon\u2019s trial was \u201cin large part the result of his own actions\u201d\nand that Brillon had \u201cfailed to demonstrate prejudice as a\nresult of [the] pre-trial delay.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 72.\n   On appeal, the Vermont Supreme Court held 3 to 2 that\nBrillon\u2019s conviction must be vacated and the charges\ndismissed for violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a\nspeedy trial. Citing the balancing test of Barker v. Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972), the majority concluded that all four\nof the factors described in Barker\u2014\u201c[l]ength of delay, the\nreason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right,\nand prejudice to the defendant\u201d\u2014weighed against the\nState. Id., at 530.\n   The court first found that the three-year delay in bring\u00ad\ning Brillon to trial was \u201cextreme\u201d and weighed heavily in\nhis favor. See 955 A. 2d, at 1116. In assessing the rea\u00ad\nsons for that delay, the Vermont Supreme Court sepa\u00ad\nrately considered the period of each counsel\u2019s representa\u00ad\ntion. It acknowledged that the first year, when Brillon\nwas represented by Ammons and Altieri, should not count\n6                       VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst the State. Id., at 1120. But the court counted\nmuch of the remaining two years against the State for\ndelays \u201ccaused, for the most part, by the failure of several\nof defendant\u2019s assigned counsel, over an inordinate period\nof time, to move his case forward.\u201d Id., at 1122. As for the\nthird and fourth factors, the court found that Brillon\n\u201crepeatedly and adamantly demanded to be tried,\u201d ibid.,\nand that his \u201clengthy pretrial incarceration\u201d was prejudi\u00ad\ncial, despite his insubstantial assertions of evidentiary\nprejudice, id., at 1125.\n   The dissent strongly disputed the majority\u2019s characteri\u00ad\nzation of the periods of delay. It concluded that \u201cthe lion\u2019s\nshare of delay in this case is attributable to defendant,\nand not to the state.\u201d Id., at 1127. But for Brillon\u2019s \u201cre\u00ad\npeated maneuvers to dismiss his lawyers and avoid trial\nthrough the first eleven months following arraignment,\u201d\nthe dissent explained, \u201cthe difficulty in finding additional\ncounsel would not have arisen.\u201d Id., at 1128.\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008),5 and now\nreverse the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court.\n                             II\n    The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \u201c[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n. . . trial.\u201d The speedy-trial right is \u201camorphous,\u201d \u201cslip\u00ad\npery,\u201d and \u201cnecessarily relative.\u201d Barker, 407 U.

Const., Ch. I, Art.\n10. Notably, the Vermont Supreme Court made no ruling under the\nState\u2019s own prescription, but instead relied solely on the Federal\nConstitution. Because it did so, our review authority was properly\ninvoked and exercised. See Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 719\u2013720\n(1975); Ginsburg, Book Review, 92 Harv. L.

In Barker, the Court refused to \u201cquantif[y]\u201d the\nright \u201cinto a specified number of days or months\u201d or to\nhinge the right on a defendant\u2019s explicit request for a\nspeedy trial. Id., at 522\u2013525. Rejecting such \u201cinflexible\napproaches,\u201d Barker established a \u201cbalancing test, in\nwhich the conduct of both the prosecution and the defen\u00ad\ndant are weighed.\u201d Id., at 529, 530. \u201c[S]ome of the fac\u00ad\ntors\u201d that courts should weigh include \u201c[l]ength of delay,\nthe reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his\nright, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Ibid.\n   Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in\nBrillon\u2019s trial. Barker instructs that \u201cdifferent weights\nshould be assigned to different reasons,\u201d id., at 531, and in\napplying Barker, we have asked \u201cwhether the government\nor the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.\u201d\nDoggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651 (1992). Delib\u00ad\nerate delay \u201cto hamper the defense\u201d weighs heavily\nagainst the prosecution.       Barker, 407 U. S., at 531.\n\u201c[M]ore neutral reason[s] such as negligence or over\u00ad\ncrowded courts\u201d weigh less heavily \u201cbut nevertheless\nshould be considered since the ultimate responsibility for\nsuch circumstances must rest with the government rather\nthan with the defendant.\u201d Ibid.\n   In contrast, delay caused by the defense weighs against\nthe defendant: \u201c[I]f delay is attributable to the defendant,\nthen his waiver may be given effect under standard waiver\ndoctrine.\u201d Id., at 529. Cf. United States v. Loud Hawk,\n474 U.

That rule accords with\nthe reality that defendants may have incentives to employ\ndelay as a \u201cdefense tactic\u201d: delay may \u201cwork to the ac\u00ad\ncused\u2019s advantage\u201d because \u201cwitnesses may become un\u00ad\navailable or their memories may fade\u201d over time.

S., at 521.\n   Because \u201cthe attorney is the [defendant\u2019s] agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,\u201d\ndelay caused by the defendant\u2019s counsel is also charged\nagainst the defendant. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991).6 The same principle applies whether\ncounsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n\u201c[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an\naccused, the duties and obligations are the same whether\nthe lawyer is privately retained, appointed, or serving in a\nlegal aid or defender program.\u201d Polk County v. Dodson,\n454 U. S. 312, 318 (1981) (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). \u201cExcept for the source of payment,\u201d the relationship\nbetween a defendant and the public defender representing\nhim is \u201cidentical to that existing between any other lawyer\nand client.\u201d Ibid. Unlike a prosecutor or the court, as\u00ad\nsigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a state actor.7\n                            III\n   Barker\u2019s formulation \u201cnecessarily compels courts to\napproach speedy trial cases on an ad hoc basis,\u201d 407 U. S.,\nat 530, and the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily\nwould not prompt this Court\u2019s review. But the Vermont\nSupreme Court made a fundamental error in its applica\u00ad\ntion of Barker that calls for this Court\u2019s correction. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Several States\u2019 speedy-trial statutes expressly exclude from compu\u00ad\n\ntation of the time limit continuances and delays caused by the defen\u00ad\ndant or defense counsel. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71381 (West\n2000); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \u00a75/103\u20135(f) (2006); N. Y. Crim. Proc.\nLaw Ann. \u00a730.30(4) (West Supp. 2009); Alaska Rule Crim.

Id., at 1111, 1122. In this case,\nthat court concluded, \u201ca significant portion of the delay in\nbringing defendant to trial must be attributed to the state,\neven though most of the delay was caused by the inability\nor unwillingness of assigned counsel to move the case\nforward.\u201d Id., at 1121.\n  We disagree. An assigned counsel\u2019s failure \u201cto move the\ncase forward\u201d does not warrant attribution of delay to the\nState. Contrary to the Vermont Supreme Court\u2019s analysis,\nassigned counsel generally are not state actors for pur\u00ad\nposes of a speedy-trial claim. While the Vermont Defender\nGeneral\u2019s office is indeed \u201cpart of the criminal justice\nsystem,\u201d ibid., the individual counsel here acted only on\nbehalf of Brillon, not the State. See Polk County, 454\nU. S., at 320\u2013322 (rejecting the view that public defenders\nact under color of state law because they are paid by the\nState). See also supra, at 8.\n  Most of the delay that the Vermont Supreme Court\nattributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\nBrillon as delays caused by his counsel. During those\nperiods, Brillon was represented by Donaldson, Sleigh,\nand Moore, all of whom requested extensions and continu\u00ad\nances.8 Their \u201cinability or unwillingness . . . to move the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The State conceded before the Vermont Supreme Court that the\n\nperiod of Sleigh\u2019s representation\u2014along with a six-month period of no\nrepresentation\u2014was properly attributed to the State. 955 A. 2d 1108,\n10                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncase forward,\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1121, may not be attributed to\nthe State simply because they are assigned counsel.\n   A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed coun\u00ad\nsel to delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continu\u00ad\nances, hoping thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indict\u00ad\nment on speedy-trial grounds. Trial courts might well\nrespond by viewing continuance requests made by ap\u00ad\npointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that even an\napparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\ntactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a\nprivately retained counsel\u2019s requests for time extensions.\nWe see no justification for treating defendants\u2019 speedy\u00ad\ntrial claims differently based on whether their counsel is\nprivately retained or publicly assigned.\n                             B\n   In addition to making assigned counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure . . . to\nmove [the] case forward\u201d the touchstone of its speedy-trial\ninquiry, the Vermont Supreme Court further erred by\ntreating the period of each counsel\u2019s representation dis\u00ad\ncretely. The factors identified in Barker \u201chave no talis\u00ad\nmanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and\nsensitive balancing process.\u201d 407 U. S., at 533. Yet the\nVermont Supreme Court failed appropriately to take into\naccount Brillon\u2019s role during the first year of delay in \u201cthe\nchain of events that started all this.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.\n   Brillon sought to dismiss Ammons on the eve of trial.\nHis strident, aggressive behavior with regard to Altieri,\nwhom he threatened, further impeded prompt trial and\nlikely made it more difficult for the Defender General\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1120\u20131121 (2008).

We agree that in light of the three-year delay caused mostly\nby Brillon, the attribution of Sleigh\u2019s three-month representation does\nnot tip the balance for either side.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

Even after the trial\ncourt\u2019s warning regarding delay, Brillon sought dismissal\nof yet another attorney, Donaldson. Just as a State\u2019s\n\u201cdeliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper\nthe defense should be weighted heavily against the\n[State],\u201d Barker, 407 U. S., at 531, so too should a defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings be\nweighted heavily against the defendant. Absent Brillon\u2019s\ndeliberate efforts to force the withdrawal of Ammons and\nAltieri, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen. The effect\nof these earlier events should have been factored into the\ncourt\u2019s analysis of subsequent delay.9\n                               C\n  The general rule attributing to the defendant delay\ncaused by assigned counsel is not absolute. Delay result\u00ad\ning from a systemic \u201cbreakdown in the public defender\nsystem,\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1111, could be charged to the State.\nCf. Polk County, 454 U. S., at 324\u2013325. But the Vermont\nSupreme Court made no determination, and nothing in\nthe record suggests, that institutional problems caused\nany part of the delay in Brillon\u2019s case.\n  In sum, delays caused by defense counsel are properly\nattributed to the defendant, even where counsel is as\u00ad\nsigned. \u201c[A]ny inquiry into a speedy trial claim necessi\u00ad\ntates a functional analysis of the right in the particular\ncontext of the case,\u201d Barker, 407 U. S., at 522, and the\nrecord in this case does not show that Brillon was denied\nhis constitutional right to a speedy trial.\n                      *    *    *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Vermont\nSupreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Brillon lacked counsel for some six months. In light of his own role\n\nin the initial periods of delay, however, this six-month period, even if\nattributed to the State, does not establish a speedy-trial violation.\n12                 VERMONT v.

Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972).\u201d Pet. for Cert. i, \u00b61. The case, in my\nview, does not squarely present that question, for the\nVermont Supreme Court, when it found Michael Brillon\u2019s\ntrial unconstitutionally delayed, did not count such delays\nagainst the State. The court\u2019s opinion for the most part\nmakes that fact clear; at worst some passages are ambigu\u00ad\nous. Given these circumstances, I would dismiss the writ\nof certiorari as improvidently granted.\n                              I\n  The relevant time period consists of slightly less than\nthree years, stretching from July 2001, when Brillon was\nindicted, until mid-June 2004, when he was convicted and\nsentenced. In light of Brillon\u2019s improper behavior, see\nante, at 3\u20134, the Vermont Supreme Court did not count\nmonths 1 through 12 (mid-July 2001 through mid-June\n2002) against the State. Noting the objection that Brillon\nhad sought to \u201cintentionally sabotag[e] the criminal pro\u00ad\nceedings against him,\u201d the Vermont Supreme Court was\nexplicit that this time period \u201cdo[es] not count . . . against\nthe [S]tate.\u201d 955 A. 2d 1108, 1120 (2008).\n2                  VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Vermont Supreme Court did count months 13\nthrough 17 (mid-June 2002 through November 2002)\nagainst the State. It did so under circumstances where (1)\nBrillon\u2019s counsel, Paul Donaldson, revealed that his con\u00ad\ntract with the defender general\u2019s office had expired in\nJune 2002\u2014shortly after (perhaps before!) he took over as\nBrillon\u2019s counsel, App. 232\u2013233, (2) he stated that this\ncase was \u201cbasically the beginning of [his] departure from\nthe contract,\u201d ibid., and (3) he made no filings, missed\nseveral deadlines, did \u201clittle or nothing\u201d to \u201cmove the case\nforward,\u201d and made only one brief appearance at a status\nconference in mid-August. 955 A. 2d, at 1121. I believe it\nfairer to characterize this period, not as a period in which\n\u201cassigned counsel\u201d failed to move the case forward, ante, at\n1, but as a period in which Brillon, in practice, had no\nassigned counsel. And, given that the State conceded its\nresponsibility for delays caused by another defender who\nresigned for \u201ccontractual reasons,\u201d see infra at 3, it is\nhardly unreasonable that the Vermont Supreme Court\ncounted this period of delay against the State.\n   The Vermont Supreme Court also counted months 18\nthrough 25 (the end of November 2002 through July 2003)\nagainst the State. It did so because the State conceded in\nits brief that this period of delay \u201ccannot be attributed to\nthe defendant.\u201d App. 78 (emphasis added). This conces\u00ad\nsion is not surprising in light of the fact that during much\nof this period, Brillon was represented by David Sleigh, a\ncontract attorney, who during the course of his represen\u00ad\ntation filed nothing on Brillon\u2019s behalf except a single\nmotion seeking to extend discovery. The record reflects no\nother actions by Sleigh other than a letter sent to Brillon\ninforming him that \u201c[a]s a result of modifications to our\nfirm\u2019s contract with the Defender General, we will not be\nrepresenting you in your pending case.\u201d Id., at 158. Bril\u00ad\nlon was left without counsel for a period of nearly six\nmonths. The State explained in conceding its responsibil\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

But it is impossible to conclude from the opin\u00ad\nion whether it did so because it held the State responsible\nfor the defender\u2019s failure to \u201cmove the case forward,\u201d or for\nother reasons having nothing to do with counsel, namely\nthe judge\u2019s unavailability, see id., at 138, or the fact that\n\u201cthe [case] files were incomplete\u201d and \u201cadditional docu\u00ad\nments were needed from the State,\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1120\u2013\n1121. Treating the opinion as charging the State on the\nbasis of the defender\u2019s conduct is made more difficult by\nthe fact that Brillon did not argue below that Kathleen\nMoore, his defender during this period, caused any delays.\nAppellant\u2019s Reply Brief in No. 2005\u2013167 (Vt.), 2007 WL\n990004, *7.\n                              II\n  In sum, I can find no convincing reason to believe the\nVermont Supreme Court made the error of constitutional\nlaw that the majority attributes to it. Rather than read\nambiguities in its opinion against it, thereby assuming the\npresence of the error the Court finds, I would dismiss the\nwrit as improvidently granted. As a majority nonetheless\nwishes to decide the case, I would note that the Vermont\nSupreme Court has considerable authority to supervise\nthe appointment of public defenders. See Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 13, \u00a7\u00a75204, 5272 (1998); see also Vt. Rule Crim. Proc.\n44 (2003). It consequently warrants leeway when it de\u00ad\ncides whether a particular failing is properly attributed to\nassigned counsel or instead to the failure of the defender\ngeneral\u2019s office properly to assign counsel.

BRILLON\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VERMONT\n\n     No. 08\u201388. Argued January 13, 2009\u2014Decided March 9, 2009\nIn July 2001, respondent Brillon was arrested on felony domestic as\n  sault and habitual offender charges. Nearly three years later, in\n  June 2004, he was tried by jury, found guilty as charged, and sen\n  tenced to 12 to 20 years in prison. During the time between his ar\n  rest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to\n  represent him. Brillon \u201cfired\u201d his first attorney, who served from\n  July 2001 to February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\n  March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he re\n  ported that Brillon had threatened his life. His fourth lawyer served\n  from June 2002 until November 2002, when the trial court released\n  him from the case. His fifth lawyer, assigned two months later,\n  withdrew in April 2003. Four months thereafter, his sixth lawyer\n  was assigned, and she took the case to trial in June 2004.\n     The trial court denied Brillon\u2019s motion to dismiss for want of a\n  speedy trial. The Vermont Supreme Court, however, reversed, hold\n  ing that Brillon\u2019s conviction must be vacated, and the charges against\n  him dismissed, because the State did not accord him the speedy trial\n  required by the Sixth Amendment. Citing the balancing test this\n  Court stated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, the Vermont Su\n  preme Court concluded that all four factors described in Barker\u2014\n  \u201c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion\n  of his right, and prejudice to the defendant,\u201d id., at 530\u2014weighed\n  against the State. Weighing heavily in Brillon\u2019s favor, the Vermont\n  court said, the three-year delay in bringing him to trial was \u201cex\n  treme.\u201d In assessing the reasons for that delay, the court separately\n  considered the period of each counsel\u2019s representation. It acknowl\n  edged that the first year, when Brillon was represented by his first\n  and third lawyers, should not count against the State. But the court\n  counted much of the remaining two years against the State. Delays\n2                        VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    in that period, the court determined, were caused, for the most part,\n    by the failure or unwillingness of several of the assigned counsel,\n    over an inordinate period of time, to move the case forward. As for\n    the third and fourth Barker v. Wingo factors, the court found that\n    Brillon repeatedly and adamantly demanded a trial and that his\n    lengthy pretrial incarceration was prejudicial.\nHeld: The Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel\n essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system. Assigned\n counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and\n delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defen\n dants they represent. Pp. 6\u201311.\n    (a) Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in Brillon\u2019s\n trial. In applying Barker, the Court has asked \u201cwhether the govern\n ment or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.\u201d\n Doggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651. Delay \u201cto hamper the\n defense\u201d weighs heavily against the prosecution, Barker, 407 U. S., at\n 531, while delay caused by the defense weighs against the defendant,\n id., at 529. Because \u201cthe attorney is the [defendant\u2019s] agent when\n acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,\u201d delay caused\n by the defendant\u2019s counsel is charged against the defendant. Cole\n man v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 753. The same principle applies\n whether counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n \u201c \u2018[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an accused,\n the duties and obligations are the same whether the lawyer is pri\n vately retained, appointed, or serving in a legal aid or defender pro\n gram.\u2019 \u201d Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 318. Unlike a prose\n cutor or the court, assigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a\n state actor. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) Although the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily would\n not prompt this Court\u2019s review, the Vermont Supreme Court made a\n fundamental error in its application of Barker that calls for this\n Court\u2019s correction. The court erred in attributing to the State delays\n caused by the failure of several assigned counsel to move Brillon\u2019s\n case forward and in failing adequately to take into account the role of\n Brillon\u2019s disruptive behavior in the overall balance. Pp. 8\u201311.\n       (1) An assigned counsel\u2019s failure to move the case forward does\n not warrant attribution of delay to the State. Most of the delay the\n Vermont court attributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\n Brillon as delays caused by his counsel, each of whom requested time\n extensions. Their inability or unwillingness to move the case forward\n may not be attributed to the State simply because they are assigned\n counsel. A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed counsel to\n delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continuances, hoping\n thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indictment on speedy-trial\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  grounds. Trial courts might well respond by viewing continuance re\n  quests made by appointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that\n  even an apparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\n  tactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a privately re\n  tained counsel\u2019s requests for time extensions. There is no justifica\n  tion for treating defendants\u2019 speedy-trial claims differently based on\n  whether their counsel is privately retained or publicly assigned.\n  Pp. 9\u201310.\n        (2) The Vermont Supreme Court further erred by treating the\n  period of each counsel\u2019s representation discretely. The court failed\n  appropriately to take into account Brillon\u2019s role during the first year\n  of delay. Brillon sought to dismiss his first attorney on the eve of\n  trial. His strident, aggressive behavior with regard to his third at\n  torney further impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult\n  for the Defender General\u2019s office to find replacement counsel. Absent\n  Brillon\u2019s efforts to force the withdrawal of his first and third attor\n  neys, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen. Pp. 10\u201311.\n     (c) The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by\n  assigned counsel is not absolute. Delay resulting from a systemic\n  breakdown in the public defender system could be charged to the\n  State. Cf. Polk County, 454 U. S., at 324\u2013325. But the Vermont Su\n  preme Court made no determination, and nothing in the record sug\n  gests, that institutional problems caused any part of the delay in\n  Brillon\u2019s case.

MICHAEL BRILLON\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      VERMONT\n\n                                 [March 9, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the Sixth Amendment guarantee\nthat \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\nthe right to a speedy . . . trial.\u201d Michael Brillon, defendant\nbelow, respondent here, was arrested in July 2001 on\nfelony domestic assault and habitual offender charges.\nNearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by\njury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20\nyears in prison. The Vermont Supreme Court vacated\nBrillon\u2019s conviction and held that the charges against him\nmust be dismissed because he had been denied his right to\na speedy trial.\n   During the time between Brillon\u2019s arrest and his trial,\nat least six different attorneys were appointed to represent\nhim. Brillon \u201cfired\u201d the first, who served from July 2001\nto February 2002. His third lawyer, who served from\nMarch 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw\nwhen he reported that Brillon had threatened his life. The\nVermont Supreme Court charged against Brillon the\ndelays associated with those periods, but charged against\nthe State periods in which assigned counsel failed \u201cto\nmove the case forward.\u201d 955 A. 2d 1108, 1121, 1122\n2                     VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(2008).\n  We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in\nranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the\ncriminal justice system. Assigned counsel, just as retained\ncounsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by\ncounsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they\nrepresent. For a total of some six months of the time that\nelapsed between Brillon\u2019s arrest and his trial, Brillon\nlacked an attorney. The State may be charged with those\nmonths if the gaps resulted from the trial court\u2019s failure to\nappoint replacement counsel with dispatch. Similarly, the\nState may bear responsibility if there is \u201ca breakdown in\nthe public defender system.\u201d Id., at 1111. But, as the\nVermont Supreme Court acknowledged, id., at 1126, the\nrecord does not establish any such institutional break\u00ad\ndown.\n                              I\n   On July 27, 2001, Michael Brillon was arrested after\nstriking his girlfriend. Three days later he was arraigned\nin state court in Bennington County, Vermont and\ncharged with felony domestic assault. His alleged status\nas a habitual offender exposed him to a potential life\nsentence. The court ordered him held without bail.\n   Richard Ammons, from the county public defender\u2019s\noffice, was assigned on the day of arraignment as Brillon\u2019s\nfirst counsel.1 In October, Ammons filed a motion to\nrecuse the trial judge. It was denied the next month and\ntrial was scheduled for February 2002. In mid-January,\nAmmons moved for a continuance, but the State objected,\nand the trial court denied the motion.\n   On February 22, four days before the jury draw, Am\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Vermont\u2019s\n              Defender General has \u201cthe primary responsibility for\nproviding needy persons with legal services.\u201d Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13,\n\u00a75253(a) (1998). These services may be provided \u201cpersonally, through\npublic defenders,\u201d or through contract attorneys.

S. ____ (2009)                       3\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nmons again moved for a continuance, citing his heavy\nworkload and the need for further investigation. Ammons\nacknowledged that any delay would not count (presumably\nagainst the State) for speedy-trial purposes. The State\nopposed the motion,2 and at the conclusion of a hearing,\nthe trial court denied it. Brillon, participating in the\nproceedings through interactive television, then an\u00ad\nnounced: \u201cYou\u2019re fired, Rick.\u201d App. 187. Three days later,\nthe trial court\u2014over the State\u2019s objection\u2014granted Am\u00ad\nmons\u2019 motion to withdraw as counsel, citing Brillon\u2019s\ntermination of Ammons and Ammons\u2019 statement that he\ncould no longer zealously represent Brillon.3 The trial\ncourt warned Brillon that further delay would occur while\na new attorney became familiar with the case. The same\nday, the trial court appointed a second attorney, but he\nimmediately withdrew based on a conflict.\n  On March 1, 2002, Gerard Altieri was assigned as Bril\u00ad\nlon\u2019s third counsel. On May 20, Brillon filed a motion to\ndismiss Altieri for, among other reasons, failure to file\nmotions, \u201c[v]irtually no communication whatsoever,\u201d and\nhis lack of diligence \u201cbecause of heavy case load.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b62,\n5, at 113\u2013114. At a June 11 hearing, Altieri denied sev\u00ad\neral of Brillon\u2019s allegations, noted his disagreement with\nBrillon\u2019s trial strategy,4 and insisted he had plenty of time\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The State expressed its concern that the continuance request was\n\n\u201cjust part and parcel of an effort by the defense to have the Court not\nhear this matter.\u201d App. 180. Under Vermont procedures, the judge\npresiding over the trial was scheduled to \u201crotate\u201d out of the county\nwhere Brillon\u2019s case was pending in March 2002. See id., \u00b66, at 109.\nThus, a continuance past March would have caused a different judge to\npreside over Brillon\u2019s trial, despite the denial of his motion to recuse\nthe initial judge. Ammons requested a continuance until April.\n   3 Ammons also cited as cause to withdraw, \u201ccertain irreconcilable\n\ndifferences in preferred approach between Mr. Brillon and counsel as to\ntrial strategy, as well as other legitimate legal decisions.\u201d Id., \u00b62, at\n104.\n   4 Specifically, Altieri appeared reluctant to follow Brillon\u2019s tactic that\n4                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto prepare. The State opposed Brillon\u2019s motion as well.\nNear the end of the hearing, however, Altieri moved to\nwithdraw on the ground that Brillon had threatened his\nlife during a break in the proceedings. The trial court\ngranted Brillon\u2019s motion to dismiss Altieri, but warned\nBrillon that \u201cthis is somewhat of a dubious victory in your\ncase because it simply prolongs the time that you will\nremain in jail until we can bring this matter to trial.\u201d Id.,\nat 226.\n   That same day, the trial court appointed Paul\nDonaldson as Brillon\u2019s fourth counsel. At an August 5\nstatus conference, Donaldson requested additional time to\nconduct discovery in light of his caseload. A few weeks\nlater, Brillon sent a letter to the court complaining about\nDonaldson\u2019s unresponsiveness and lack of competence.\nTwo months later, Brillon filed a motion to dismiss\nDonaldson\u2014similar to his motion to dismiss Altieri\u2014for\nfailure to file motions and \u201cvirtually no communication\nwhatsoever.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b61, 2, at 115\u2013116. At a November 26\nhearing, Donaldson reported that his contract with the\nDefender General\u2019s office had expired in June and that he\nhad been in discussions to have Brillon\u2019s case reassigned.\nThe trial court released Donaldson from the case\n\u201c[w]ithout making any findings regarding the adequacy of\n[Donaldson]\u2019s representation.\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1119. Cf.\npost, at 2.\n   Brillon\u2019s fifth counsel, David Sleigh, was not assigned\nuntil January 15, 2003; Brillon was without counsel dur\u00ad\ning the intervening two months. On February 25, Sleigh\nsought extensions of various discovery deadlines, noting\nthat he had been in trial out of town. App. 117. On April\n10, however, Sleigh withdrew from the case, based on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nhe \u201cbring in a lot of people\u201d at trial, \u201csome of them young kids and \n\nrelatives . . . in an attempt by Mr. Brillon\u2014this is his theory\u2014I don\u2019t\n\nwant to use the words trash, [to] impeach [the victim].\u201d Id., at 216\u2013217. \n\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

On June 20, the Defender General\u2019s office noti\u00ad\nfied the court that it had received \u201cfunding from the legis\u00ad\nlature\u201d and would hire a new special felony unit defender\nfor Brillon. Id., at 159. On August 1, Kathleen Moore was\nappointed as Brillon\u2019s sixth counsel. The trial court set\nNovember 7 as the deadline for motions, but granted\nseveral extensions in accord with the parties\u2019 stipulation.\nOn February 23, 2004, Moore filed a motion to dismiss for\nlack of a speedy trial. The trial court denied the motion on\nApril 19.\n   The case finally went to trial on June 14, 2004. Brillon\nwas found guilty and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.\nThe trial court denied a post-trial motion to dismiss for\nwant of a speedy trial, concluding that the delay in Bril\u00ad\nlon\u2019s trial was \u201cin large part the result of his own actions\u201d\nand that Brillon had \u201cfailed to demonstrate prejudice as a\nresult of [the] pre-trial delay.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 72.\n   On appeal, the Vermont Supreme Court held 3 to 2 that\nBrillon\u2019s conviction must be vacated and the charges\ndismissed for violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a\nspeedy trial. Citing the balancing test of Barker v. Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972), the majority concluded that all four\nof the factors described in Barker\u2014\u201c[l]ength of delay, the\nreason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right,\nand prejudice to the defendant\u201d\u2014weighed against the\nState. Id., at 530.\n   The court first found that the three-year delay in bring\u00ad\ning Brillon to trial was \u201cextreme\u201d and weighed heavily in\nhis favor. See 955 A. 2d, at 1116. In assessing the rea\u00ad\nsons for that delay, the Vermont Supreme Court sepa\u00ad\nrately considered the period of each counsel\u2019s representa\u00ad\ntion. It acknowledged that the first year, when Brillon\nwas represented by Ammons and Altieri, should not count\n6                       VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst the State. Id., at 1120. But the court counted\nmuch of the remaining two years against the State for\ndelays \u201ccaused, for the most part, by the failure of several\nof defendant\u2019s assigned counsel, over an inordinate period\nof time, to move his case forward.\u201d Id., at 1122. As for the\nthird and fourth factors, the court found that Brillon\n\u201crepeatedly and adamantly demanded to be tried,\u201d ibid.,\nand that his \u201clengthy pretrial incarceration\u201d was prejudi\u00ad\ncial, despite his insubstantial assertions of evidentiary\nprejudice, id., at 1125.\n   The dissent strongly disputed the majority\u2019s characteri\u00ad\nzation of the periods of delay. It concluded that \u201cthe lion\u2019s\nshare of delay in this case is attributable to defendant,\nand not to the state.\u201d Id., at 1127. But for Brillon\u2019s \u201cre\u00ad\npeated maneuvers to dismiss his lawyers and avoid trial\nthrough the first eleven months following arraignment,\u201d\nthe dissent explained, \u201cthe difficulty in finding additional\ncounsel would not have arisen.\u201d Id., at 1128.\n   We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008),5 and now\nreverse the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court.\n                             II\n    The Sixth Amendment guarantees that \u201c[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy\n. . . trial.\u201d The speedy-trial right is \u201camorphous,\u201d \u201cslip\u00ad\npery,\u201d and \u201cnecessarily relative.\u201d Barker, 407 U. S., at 522\n(quoting Beavers v. Haubert, 198 U. S. 77, 87 (1905)). It is\n\u201cconsistent with delays and depend[ent] upon circum\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Vermont\u2019s Constitution contains a speedy-trial clause which reads:\n\n\u201c[I]n all prosecutions for criminal offenses, a person hath a right to . . .\na speedy public trial by an impartial jury . . . .\u201d Vt. Const., Ch. I, Art.\n10. Notably, the Vermont Supreme Court made no ruling under the\nState\u2019s own prescription, but instead relied solely on the Federal\nConstitution. Because it did so, our review authority was properly\ninvoked and exercised. See Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714, 719\u2013720\n(1975); Ginsburg, Book Review, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 340, 343\u2013344 (1978).\nBut see post, at 1\u20134.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances.\u201d 407 U. S., at 522 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In Barker, the Court refused to \u201cquantif[y]\u201d the\nright \u201cinto a specified number of days or months\u201d or to\nhinge the right on a defendant\u2019s explicit request for a\nspeedy trial. Id., at 522\u2013525. Rejecting such \u201cinflexible\napproaches,\u201d Barker established a \u201cbalancing test, in\nwhich the conduct of both the prosecution and the defen\u00ad\ndant are weighed.\u201d Id., at 529, 530. \u201c[S]ome of the fac\u00ad\ntors\u201d that courts should weigh include \u201c[l]ength of delay,\nthe reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his\nright, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Ibid.\n   Primarily at issue here is the reason for the delay in\nBrillon\u2019s trial. Barker instructs that \u201cdifferent weights\nshould be assigned to different reasons,\u201d id., at 531, and in\napplying Barker, we have asked \u201cwhether the government\nor the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.\u201d\nDoggett v. United States, 505 U. S. 647, 651 (1992). Delib\u00ad\nerate delay \u201cto hamper the defense\u201d weighs heavily\nagainst the prosecution.       Barker, 407 U. S., at 531.\n\u201c[M]ore neutral reason[s] such as negligence or over\u00ad\ncrowded courts\u201d weigh less heavily \u201cbut nevertheless\nshould be considered since the ultimate responsibility for\nsuch circumstances must rest with the government rather\nthan with the defendant.\u201d Ibid.\n   In contrast, delay caused by the defense weighs against\nthe defendant: \u201c[I]f delay is attributable to the defendant,\nthen his waiver may be given effect under standard waiver\ndoctrine.\u201d Id., at 529. Cf. United States v. Loud Hawk,\n474 U. S. 302, 316 (1986) (noting that a defendant whose\ntrial was delayed by his interlocutory appeal \u201cnormally\nshould not be able . . . to reap the reward of dismissal for\nfailure to receive a speedy trial\u201d). That rule accords with\nthe reality that defendants may have incentives to employ\ndelay as a \u201cdefense tactic\u201d: delay may \u201cwork to the ac\u00ad\ncused\u2019s advantage\u201d because \u201cwitnesses may become un\u00ad\navailable or their memories may fade\u201d over time. Barker,\n8                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n407 U. S., at 521.\n   Because \u201cthe attorney is the [defendant\u2019s] agent when\nacting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation,\u201d\ndelay caused by the defendant\u2019s counsel is also charged\nagainst the defendant. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 753 (1991).6 The same principle applies whether\ncounsel is privately retained or publicly assigned, for\n\u201c[o]nce a lawyer has undertaken the representation of an\naccused, the duties and obligations are the same whether\nthe lawyer is privately retained, appointed, or serving in a\nlegal aid or defender program.\u201d Polk County v. Dodson,\n454 U. S. 312, 318 (1981) (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). \u201cExcept for the source of payment,\u201d the relationship\nbetween a defendant and the public defender representing\nhim is \u201cidentical to that existing between any other lawyer\nand client.\u201d Ibid. Unlike a prosecutor or the court, as\u00ad\nsigned counsel ordinarily is not considered a state actor.7\n                            III\n   Barker\u2019s formulation \u201cnecessarily compels courts to\napproach speedy trial cases on an ad hoc basis,\u201d 407 U. S.,\nat 530, and the balance arrived at in close cases ordinarily\nwould not prompt this Court\u2019s review. But the Vermont\nSupreme Court made a fundamental error in its applica\u00ad\ntion of Barker that calls for this Court\u2019s correction. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Several States\u2019 speedy-trial statutes expressly exclude from compu\u00ad\n\ntation of the time limit continuances and delays caused by the defen\u00ad\ndant or defense counsel. See, e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71381 (West\n2000); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \u00a75/103\u20135(f) (2006); N. Y. Crim. Proc.\nLaw Ann. \u00a730.30(4) (West Supp. 2009); Alaska Rule Crim. Proc. 45(d)\n(1993); Ark. Rule Crim. Proc. 28.3 (2006); Ind. Rule Crim. Proc. 4(A)\n(2009). See also Brief for National Governors Association et al. as\nAmici Curiae 17\u201318, and n. 12.\n  7 A public defender may act for the State, however, \u201cwhen making\n\nhiring and firing decisions on behalf of the State,\u201d and \u201cwhile perform\u00ad\ning certain administrative and possibly investigative functions.\u201d Polk\nCounty v. Dodson, 454 U. S. 312, 325 (1981).\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nVermont Supreme Court erred in attributing to the State\ndelays caused by \u201cthe failure of several assigned counsel\n. . . to move his case forward,\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1122, and in\nfailing adequately to take into account the role of Brillon\u2019s\ndisruptive behavior in the overall balance.\n                              A\n  The Vermont Supreme Court\u2019s opinion is driven by the\nnotion that delay caused by assigned counsel\u2019s \u201cinaction\u201d\nor failure \u201cto move [the] case forward\u201d is chargeable to the\nState, not the defendant. Id., at 1111, 1122. In this case,\nthat court concluded, \u201ca significant portion of the delay in\nbringing defendant to trial must be attributed to the state,\neven though most of the delay was caused by the inability\nor unwillingness of assigned counsel to move the case\nforward.\u201d Id., at 1121.\n  We disagree. An assigned counsel\u2019s failure \u201cto move the\ncase forward\u201d does not warrant attribution of delay to the\nState. Contrary to the Vermont Supreme Court\u2019s analysis,\nassigned counsel generally are not state actors for pur\u00ad\nposes of a speedy-trial claim. While the Vermont Defender\nGeneral\u2019s office is indeed \u201cpart of the criminal justice\nsystem,\u201d ibid., the individual counsel here acted only on\nbehalf of Brillon, not the State. See Polk County, 454\nU. S., at 320\u2013322 (rejecting the view that public defenders\nact under color of state law because they are paid by the\nState). See also supra, at 8.\n  Most of the delay that the Vermont Supreme Court\nattributed to the State must therefore be attributed to\nBrillon as delays caused by his counsel. During those\nperiods, Brillon was represented by Donaldson, Sleigh,\nand Moore, all of whom requested extensions and continu\u00ad\nances.8 Their \u201cinability or unwillingness . . . to move the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The State conceded before the Vermont Supreme Court that the\n\nperiod of Sleigh\u2019s representation\u2014along with a six-month period of no\nrepresentation\u2014was properly attributed to the State. 955 A. 2d 1108,\n10                      VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncase forward,\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1121, may not be attributed to\nthe State simply because they are assigned counsel.\n   A contrary conclusion could encourage appointed coun\u00ad\nsel to delay proceedings by seeking unreasonable continu\u00ad\nances, hoping thereby to obtain a dismissal of the indict\u00ad\nment on speedy-trial grounds. Trial courts might well\nrespond by viewing continuance requests made by ap\u00ad\npointed counsel with skepticism, concerned that even an\napparently genuine need for more time is in reality a delay\ntactic. Yet the same considerations would not attend a\nprivately retained counsel\u2019s requests for time extensions.\nWe see no justification for treating defendants\u2019 speedy\u00ad\ntrial claims differently based on whether their counsel is\nprivately retained or publicly assigned.\n                             B\n   In addition to making assigned counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure . . . to\nmove [the] case forward\u201d the touchstone of its speedy-trial\ninquiry, the Vermont Supreme Court further erred by\ntreating the period of each counsel\u2019s representation dis\u00ad\ncretely. The factors identified in Barker \u201chave no talis\u00ad\nmanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and\nsensitive balancing process.\u201d 407 U. S., at 533. Yet the\nVermont Supreme Court failed appropriately to take into\naccount Brillon\u2019s role during the first year of delay in \u201cthe\nchain of events that started all this.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.\n   Brillon sought to dismiss Ammons on the eve of trial.\nHis strident, aggressive behavior with regard to Altieri,\nwhom he threatened, further impeded prompt trial and\nlikely made it more difficult for the Defender General\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1120\u20131121 (2008). The State sought to avoid its concession at oral\nargument before this Court, but in the alternative, noted that the\nperiod of Sleigh\u2019s representation \u201cis really inconsequential.\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 5\u20136. We agree that in light of the three-year delay caused mostly\nby Brillon, the attribution of Sleigh\u2019s three-month representation does\nnot tip the balance for either side.\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\noffice to find replacement counsel. Even after the trial\ncourt\u2019s warning regarding delay, Brillon sought dismissal\nof yet another attorney, Donaldson. Just as a State\u2019s\n\u201cdeliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper\nthe defense should be weighted heavily against the\n[State],\u201d Barker, 407 U. S., at 531, so too should a defen\u00ad\ndant\u2019s deliberate attempt to disrupt proceedings be\nweighted heavily against the defendant. Absent Brillon\u2019s\ndeliberate efforts to force the withdrawal of Ammons and\nAltieri, no speedy-trial issue would have arisen. The effect\nof these earlier events should have been factored into the\ncourt\u2019s analysis of subsequent delay.9\n                               C\n  The general rule attributing to the defendant delay\ncaused by assigned counsel is not absolute. Delay result\u00ad\ning from a systemic \u201cbreakdown in the public defender\nsystem,\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1111, could be charged to the State.\nCf. Polk County, 454 U. S., at 324\u2013325. But the Vermont\nSupreme Court made no determination, and nothing in\nthe record suggests, that institutional problems caused\nany part of the delay in Brillon\u2019s case.\n  In sum, delays caused by defense counsel are properly\nattributed to the defendant, even where counsel is as\u00ad\nsigned. \u201c[A]ny inquiry into a speedy trial claim necessi\u00ad\ntates a functional analysis of the right in the particular\ncontext of the case,\u201d Barker, 407 U. S., at 522, and the\nrecord in this case does not show that Brillon was denied\nhis constitutional right to a speedy trial.\n                      *    *    *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Vermont\nSupreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Brillon lacked counsel for some six months. In light of his own role\n\nin the initial periods of delay, however, this six-month period, even if\nattributed to the State, does not establish a speedy-trial violation.\n12                 VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

MICHAEL BRILLON\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      VERMONT\n\n                         [March 9, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS joins,\ndissenting.\n   We granted certiorari in this case to decide whether\ndelays caused \u201csolely\u201d by a public defender can be \u201ccharged\nagainst the State pursuant to the test in Barker v. Wingo,\n407 U. S. 514 (1972).\u201d Pet. for Cert. i, \u00b61. The case, in my\nview, does not squarely present that question, for the\nVermont Supreme Court, when it found Michael Brillon\u2019s\ntrial unconstitutionally delayed, did not count such delays\nagainst the State. The court\u2019s opinion for the most part\nmakes that fact clear; at worst some passages are ambigu\u00ad\nous. Given these circumstances, I would dismiss the writ\nof certiorari as improvidently granted.\n                              I\n  The relevant time period consists of slightly less than\nthree years, stretching from July 2001, when Brillon was\nindicted, until mid-June 2004, when he was convicted and\nsentenced. In light of Brillon\u2019s improper behavior, see\nante, at 3\u20134, the Vermont Supreme Court did not count\nmonths 1 through 12 (mid-July 2001 through mid-June\n2002) against the State. Noting the objection that Brillon\nhad sought to \u201cintentionally sabotag[e] the criminal pro\u00ad\nceedings against him,\u201d the Vermont Supreme Court was\nexplicit that this time period \u201cdo[es] not count . . . against\nthe [S]tate.\u201d 955 A. 2d 1108, 1120 (2008).\n2                  VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The Vermont Supreme Court did count months 13\nthrough 17 (mid-June 2002 through November 2002)\nagainst the State. It did so under circumstances where (1)\nBrillon\u2019s counsel, Paul Donaldson, revealed that his con\u00ad\ntract with the defender general\u2019s office had expired in\nJune 2002\u2014shortly after (perhaps before!) he took over as\nBrillon\u2019s counsel, App. 232\u2013233, (2) he stated that this\ncase was \u201cbasically the beginning of [his] departure from\nthe contract,\u201d ibid., and (3) he made no filings, missed\nseveral deadlines, did \u201clittle or nothing\u201d to \u201cmove the case\nforward,\u201d and made only one brief appearance at a status\nconference in mid-August. 955 A. 2d, at 1121. I believe it\nfairer to characterize this period, not as a period in which\n\u201cassigned counsel\u201d failed to move the case forward, ante, at\n1, but as a period in which Brillon, in practice, had no\nassigned counsel. And, given that the State conceded its\nresponsibility for delays caused by another defender who\nresigned for \u201ccontractual reasons,\u201d see infra at 3, it is\nhardly unreasonable that the Vermont Supreme Court\ncounted this period of delay against the State.\n   The Vermont Supreme Court also counted months 18\nthrough 25 (the end of November 2002 through July 2003)\nagainst the State. It did so because the State conceded in\nits brief that this period of delay \u201ccannot be attributed to\nthe defendant.\u201d App. 78 (emphasis added). This conces\u00ad\nsion is not surprising in light of the fact that during much\nof this period, Brillon was represented by David Sleigh, a\ncontract attorney, who during the course of his represen\u00ad\ntation filed nothing on Brillon\u2019s behalf except a single\nmotion seeking to extend discovery. The record reflects no\nother actions by Sleigh other than a letter sent to Brillon\ninforming him that \u201c[a]s a result of modifications to our\nfirm\u2019s contract with the Defender General, we will not be\nrepresenting you in your pending case.\u201d Id., at 158. Bril\u00ad\nlon was left without counsel for a period of nearly six\nmonths. The State explained in conceding its responsibil\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nity for this delay that Sleigh had been forced to withdraw\n\u201cfor contractual reasons,\u201d and that the defender general\u2019s\noffice had been unable to replace him \u201cfor funding rea\u00ad\nsons.\u201d Id., at 78.\n   Finally, the Vermont Supreme Court counted against\nthe State the last 11 months\u2014from August 2003 to mid-\nJune 2004. But it is impossible to conclude from the opin\u00ad\nion whether it did so because it held the State responsible\nfor the defender\u2019s failure to \u201cmove the case forward,\u201d or for\nother reasons having nothing to do with counsel, namely\nthe judge\u2019s unavailability, see id., at 138, or the fact that\n\u201cthe [case] files were incomplete\u201d and \u201cadditional docu\u00ad\nments were needed from the State,\u201d 955 A. 2d, at 1120\u2013\n1121. Treating the opinion as charging the State on the\nbasis of the defender\u2019s conduct is made more difficult by\nthe fact that Brillon did not argue below that Kathleen\nMoore, his defender during this period, caused any delays.\nAppellant\u2019s Reply Brief in No. 2005\u2013167 (Vt.), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">990004</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *7.\n                              II\n  In sum, I can find no convincing reason to believe the\nVermont Supreme Court made the error of constitutional\nlaw that the majority attributes to it. Rather than read\nambiguities in its opinion against it, thereby assuming the\npresence of the error the Court finds, I would dismiss the\nwrit as improvidently granted. As a majority nonetheless\nwishes to decide the case, I would note that the Vermont\nSupreme Court has considerable authority to supervise\nthe appointment of public defenders. See Vt. Stat. Ann.,\nTit. 13, \u00a7\u00a75204, 5272 (1998); see also Vt. Rule Crim. Proc.\n44 (2003). It consequently warrants leeway when it de\u00ad\ncides whether a particular failing is properly attributed to\nassigned counsel or instead to the failure of the defender\ngeneral\u2019s office properly to assign counsel. Ante, at 11. I\ndo not believe the Vermont Supreme Court exceeded that\n4                  VERMONT v. BRILLON\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nleeway here.
