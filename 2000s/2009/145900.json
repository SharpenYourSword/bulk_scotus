Argued October 6, 2008\u2014Decided March 9, 2009\nSection 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. \u00a74, au\n  thorizes a United States district court to entertain a petition to com\n  pel arbitration if the court would have jurisdiction, \u201csave for [the ar\n  bitration] agreement,\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\n  between the parties.\u201d\n     Discover Bank\u2019s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Maryland\n  state court to recover past-due charges from one of its credit card\n  holders, petitioner Vaden. Discover\u2019s pleading presented a claim\n  arising solely under state law. Vaden answered and counterclaimed,\n  alleging that Discover\u2019s finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\n  lated state law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\n  agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a \u00a74 petition in Federal\n  District Court to compel arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counterclaims. The\n  District Court ordered arbitration.\n     On Vaden\u2019s initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case\n  for the District Court to determine whether it had subject-matter ju\n  risdiction over Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331,\n  which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \u201carising under\u201d fed\n  eral law. The Fourth Circuit instructed the District Court to conduct\n  this inquiry by \u201clooking through\u201d the \u00a74 petition to the substantive\n  controversy between the parties. With Vaden conceding that her\n  state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by \u00a727 of the\n  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the District Court expressly\n  held that it had federal-question jurisdiction and again ordered arbi\n  tration. The Fourth Circuit then affirmed. The Court of Appeals rec\n  ognized that, in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys\n  tems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, this Court held that federal-question\n  jurisdiction depends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\n2                     VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    may not be predicated on counterclaims. It concluded, however, that\n    the complete preemption doctrine is paramount and thus overrides\n    the well-pleaded complaint rule.\nHeld: A federal court may \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to determine\n whether it is predicated on a controversy that \u201carises under\u201d federal\n law; in keeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified in\n Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not entertain a \u00a74 peti\n tion based on the contents of a counterclaim when the whole contro\n versy between the parties does not qualify for federal-court adjudica\n tion. Pp. 6\u201321.\n    (a) Congress enacted the FAA \u201c[t]o overcome judicial resistance to\n arbitration,\u201d Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,\n 443, and to declare \u201c \u2018a national policy favoring arbitration\u2019 of claims\n that parties contract to settle in that manner,\u201d Preston v. Ferrer, 552\n U. S. ___, ___. To that end, \u00a72 makes arbitration agreements in con\n tracts \u201cinvolving commerce\u201d \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\u201d\n while \u00a74 provides for federal district court enforcement of those\n agreements. The \u201cbody of federal substantive law\u201d generated by\n elaboration of \u00a72 is equally binding on state and federal courts.\n Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 12. However, the FAA \u201cre\n quir[es] [for access to a federal forum] an independent jurisdictional\n basis\u201d over the parties\u2019 dispute. Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v.\n Mattel, Inc., 552 U. S. ___, ___. Under the well-pleaded complaint\n rule, a suit \u201carises under\u201d federal law for 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331 purposes\n \u201conly when the plaintiff\u2019s statement of his own cause of action shows\n that it is based upon [federal law].\u201d Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v.\n Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152. Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated\n on an actual or anticipated defense, ibid., or rest upon an actual or\n anticipated counterclaim, Holmes Group, 535 U. S. 826. A complaint\n purporting to rest on state law can be recharacterized as one \u201carising\n under\u201d federal law if the law governing the complaint is exclusively\n federal, see Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 8, but a\n state-law-based counterclaim, even if similarly susceptible to rechar\n acterization, remains nonremovable. Pp. 6\u201311.\n    (b) FAA \u00a74\u2019s text drives the conclusion that a federal court should\n determine its jurisdiction by \u201clooking through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to the\n parties\u2019 underlying substantive controversy. The phrase \u201csave for\n [the arbitration] agreement\u201d indicates that the district court should\n assume the absence of the agreement and determine whether it\n \u201cwould have jurisdiction under title 28\u201d over \u201cthe controversy be\n tween the parties,\u201d which is most straightforwardly read to mean the\n \u201cunderlying dispute\u201d between the parties. See Moses H. Cone Memo\n rial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 25, n. 32. Vaden\u2019s\n argument that the relevant \u201ccontroversy\u201d is simply and only the par\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nties\u2019 discrete dispute over the arbitrability of their claims is difficult\nto square with \u00a74\u2019s language. If courts are to determine whether they\nwould have jurisdiction \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d how\ncan a dispute over an arbitration agreement\u2019s existence or applicabil\nity be the controversy that counts? The Court is unpersuaded that\nthe \u201csave for\u201d clause means only that the \u201cantiquated and arcane\u201d\nouster notion no longer holds sway. To the extent that the ancient\n\u201couster\u201d doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitra\ntion agreements, FAA \u00a72, the Act\u2019s \u201ccenterpiece provision,\u201d Mitsubi\nshi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625,\ndirectly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration\nagreement is enforceable just as any other contract. Vaden\u2019s ap\nproach also has curious practical consequences. It would permit a\nfederal court to entertain a \u00a74 petition only when a federal-question\nsuit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the require\nments for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute\nover arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not ac\ncommodate a \u00a74 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in,\nor remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so. In con\ntrast, the \u201clook through\u201d approach permits a \u00a74 petitioner to ask a\nfederal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal\nstep of initiating or removing a federal-question suit. Pp. 11\u201315.\n   (c) Having determined that a district court should look through a\n\u00a74 petition, this Court considers whether the court \u201cwould have [fed\neral-question] jurisdiction\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\u201d\nbetween Discover and Vaden. Because \u00a74 does not enlarge federal\ncourt jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain\nsuch a court\u2019s assistance only if, \u201csave for\u201d the agreement, the entire,\nactual \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d as they have framed it,\ncould be litigated in federal court. Here, the actual controversy is not\namenable to federal-court adjudication. The \u201ccontroversy between\nthe parties\u201d arose from Vaden\u2019s \u201calleged debt,\u201d a claim that plainly\ndid not \u201carise under\u201d federal law; nor did it qualify under any other\nhead of federal-court jurisdiction. The Fourth Circuit misappre\nhended Holmes Group when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper\nbecause Vaden\u2019s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.\nUnder the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted coun\nterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key ca\npable of opening a federal court\u2019s door. Vaden\u2019s responsive counter\nclaims challenging the legality of Discover\u2019s charges are merely an\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state\ncourt. Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involv\ning that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy is one over which the fed\n4                      VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    eral courts would have jurisdiction. Section 4 does not give parties li\n    cense to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a\n    new controversy, in order to obtain a federal court\u2019s aid in compelling\n    arbitration. It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case\n    took the shape it did. Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an en\n    tirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose\n    to file responsive counterclaims. Section 4 does not invite federal\n    courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined\n    the parties\u2019 controversy. Allowing parties to commandeer a federal\n    court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while\n    leaving the remainder of the parties\u2019 controversy pending in state\n    court makes scant sense. Furthermore, the presence of a threshold\n    question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is\n    totally preempted by federal law may complicate the \u00a74 inquiry. Al\n    though FAA \u00a74 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration\n    here, Discover is not left without recourse. Because the FAA obliges\n    both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agree\n    ments, Discover may petition Maryland\u2019s courts for appropriate aid\n    in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland\n    credit cardholders.

S. C. \u00a74,\nauthorizes a United States district court to entertain a\npetition to compel arbitration if the court would have\njurisdiction, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d over \u201ca\nsuit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d\nWe consider in this opinion two questions concerning a\ndistrict court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction over a \u00a74 peti\ntion: Should a district court, if asked to compel arbitration\npursuant to \u00a74, \u201clook through\u201d the petition and grant the\nrequested relief if the court would have federal-question\njurisdiction over the underlying controversy? And if the\nanswer to that question is yes, may a district court exer\ncise jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition when the petitioner\u2019s\ncomplaint rests on state law but an actual or potential\ncounterclaim rests on federal law?\n   The litigation giving rise to these questions began when\nDiscover Bank\u2019s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in\nMaryland state court. Presenting a claim arising solely\nunder state law, Discover sought to recover past-due\ncharges from one of its credit cardholders, Betty Vaden.\n2                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Dis\ncover\u2019s finance charges, interest, and late fees violated\nstate law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\nagreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a \u00a74 petition in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Mary\nland to compel arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counterclaims. The\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over its\npetition, Discover maintained, because Vaden\u2019s state-law\ncounterclaims were completely preempted by federal\nbanking law. The District Court agreed and ordered\narbitration. Reasoning that a federal court has jurisdic\ntion over a \u00a74 petition if the parties\u2019 underlying dispute\npresents a federal question, the Fourth Circuit eventually\naffirmed.\n   We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part. A federal\ncourt may \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition and order arbitra\ntion if, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d the court\nwould have jurisdiction over \u201cthe [substantive] controversy\nbetween the parties.\u201d We hold, however, that the Court of\nAppeals misidentified the dimensions of \u201cthe controversy\nbetween the parties.\u201d Focusing on only a slice of the par\nties\u2019 entire controversy, the court seized on Vaden\u2019s coun\nterclaims, held them completely preempted, and on that\nbasis affirmed the District Court\u2019s order compelling arbi\ntration.    Lost from sight was the triggering plea\u2014\nDiscover\u2019s claim for the balance due on Vaden\u2019s account.\nGiven that entirely state-based plea and the established\nrule that federal-court jurisdiction cannot be invoked on\nthe basis of a defense or counterclaim, the whole \u201ccontro\nversy between the parties\u201d does not qualify for federal\ncourt adjudication. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 judgment.\n                          I\n  This case originated as a garden-variety, state-law\nbased contract action: Discover sued its cardholder,\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden, in a Maryland state court to recover arrearages\namounting to $10,610.74, plus interest and counsel fees.1\nVaden\u2019s answer asserted usury as an affirmative defense.\nVaden also filed several counterclaims, styled as class\nactions. Like Discover\u2019s complaint, Vaden\u2019s pleadings\ninvoked only state law: Vaden asserted that Discover\u2019s\ndemands for finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\nlated Maryland\u2019s credit laws. See Md. Com. Law Code\nAnn. \u00a7\u00a712\u2013506, 12\u2013506.2 (Lexis 2005). Neither party\ninvoked\u2014by notice to the other or petition to the state\ncourt\u2014the clause in the credit card agreement providing\nfor arbitration of \u201cany claim or dispute between [Discover\nand Vaden],\u201d App. 44 (capitalization and bold typeface\nomitted).2\n  Faced with Vaden\u2019s counterclaims, Discover sought\nfederal-court aid. It petitioned the United States District\nCourt for the District of Maryland for an order, pursuant\nto \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9\nU. S. C. \u00a74, compelling arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counter\nclaims.3 Although those counterclaims were framed under\nstate law, Discover urged that they were governed entirely\nby federal law, specifically, \u00a727(a) of the Federal Deposit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Discover apparently had no access to a federal forum for its suit\n\nagainst Vaden on the basis of diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.\nUnder that head of federal-court jurisdiction, the amount in contro\nversy must \u201cexcee[d] . . . $75,000.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(a).\n   2 Vaden\u2019s preference for court adjudication is unsurprising. The arbi\n\ntration clause, framed by Discover, prohibited presentation of \u201cany\nclaims as a representative or member of a class.\u201d App. 45 (capitaliza\ntion omitted).\n   3 Section 4 reads, in relevant part:\n\n   \u201cA party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of an\nother to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may\npetition any United States district court which, save for such agree\nment, would have jurisdiction under title 28, in a civil action or in\nadmiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties, for an order directing that such arbitration pro\nceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74.\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInsurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S. C. \u00a71831d(a). Section 27(a)\nprescribes the interest rates state-chartered, federally\ninsured banks like Discover can charge, \u201cnotwithstanding\nany State constitution or statute which is hereby pre\nempted.\u201d This provision, Discover maintained, was com\npletely preemptive, i.e., it superseded otherwise applicable\nMaryland law, and placed Vaden\u2019s counterclaims under\nthe exclusive governance of the FDIA. On that basis,\nDiscover asserted, the District Court had authority to\nentertain the \u00a74 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331,\nwhich gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \u201carising\nunder\u201d federal law.\n   The District Court granted Discover\u2019s petition, ordered\narbitration, and stayed Vaden\u2019s prosecution of her coun\nterclaims in state court pending the outcome of arbitra\ntion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a\u201390a. On Vaden\u2019s initial\nappeal, the Fourth Circuit inquired whether the District\nCourt had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover\u2019s \u00a74\npetition. To make that determination, the Court of Ap\npeals instructed, the District Court should \u201clook through\u201d\nthe \u00a74 petition to the substantive controversy between the\nparties. 396 F. 3d 366, 369, 373 (2005). The appellate\ncourt then remanded the case for an express determina\ntion whether that controversy presented \u201ca properly in\nvoked federal question.\u201d Id., at 373.\n   On remand, Vaden \u201cconcede[d] that the FDIA com\npletely preempts any state claims against a federally\ninsured bank.\u201d 409 F. Supp. 2d 632, 636 (Md. 2006).\nAccepting this concession, the District Court expressly\nheld that it had federal-question jurisdiction over Dis\ncover\u2019s \u00a74 petition and again ordered arbitration. Id., at\n634\u2013636, 639. In this second round, the Fourth Circuit\naffirmed, dividing 2 to 1. 489 F. 3d 594 (2007).\n   Recognizing that \u201ca party may not create jurisdiction by\nconcession,\u201d id., at 604, n. 10, the Fourth Circuit majority\nconducted its own analysis of FDIA \u00a727(a), ultimately\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nconcluding that the provision completely preempted state\nlaw and therefore governed Vaden\u2019s counterclaims.4 This\nCourt\u2019s decision in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air\nCirculation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826 (2002), the major\nity recognized, held that federal-question jurisdiction\ndepends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\nmay not be predicated on counterclaims. 489 F. 3d, at\n600, n. 4. Nevertheless, the majority concluded, the com\nplete preemption doctrine is paramount, \u201coverrid[ing] such\nfundamental cornerstones of federal subject-matter juris\ndiction as the well-pleaded complaint rule.\u201d Ibid. (quoting\n14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.

As \u00a727(a) of the FDIA formed no part of Discover\u2019s\ncomplaint, but came into the case only as a result of\nVaden\u2019s responsive pleadings, the dissent reasoned,\n\u201c[t]here was no \u2018properly invoked federal question\u2019 in the\nunderlying state case.\u201d 489 F. 3d, at 610.\n   We granted certiorari, 552 U.

In support of that complaint, Discover invoked\nno federal law. When Vaden answered and counter\nclaimed, however, Discover asserted that federal law,\nspecifically \u00a727(a) of the FDIA, displaced the state laws on\nwhich Vaden relied. What counts as the underlying dis\npute in a case so postured? May Discover invoke \u00a74, not\non the basis of its own complaint, which had no federal\nelement, but on the basis of counterclaims asserted by\nVaden?

See Southland, 465 U. S.,\nat 15; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, and n. 32.\n  The independent jurisdictional basis Discover relies\nupon in this case is 28 U. S.

Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152\n(1908). Federal jurisdiction cannot be predicated on an\nactual or anticipated defense: \u201cIt is not enough that the\nplaintiff alleges some anticipated defense to his cause of\naction and asserts that the defense is invalidated by some\nprovision of [federal law].\u201d Ibid.\n   Nor can federal jurisdiction rest upon an actual or an\nticipated counterclaim. We so ruled, emphatically, in\nHolmes Group, 535 U. S. 826. Without dissent, the Court\nheld in Holmes Group that a federal counterclaim, even\nwhen compulsory, does not establish \u201carising under\u201d juris\ndiction.10 Adhering assiduously to the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule, the Court observed, inter alia, that it would\nundermine the clarity and simplicity of that rule if federal\ncourts were obliged to consider the contents not only of the\ncomplaint but also of responsive pleadings in determining\nwhether a case \u201carises under\u201d federal law. Id., at 832. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535\n\nU. S. 826 (2002), involved 28 U. S.

The Court ruled that the case did not \u201caris[e] under\u201d the\npatent laws by virtue of the patent counterclaim, and therefore held\nthat the Federal Circuit lacked appellate jurisdiction under \u00a71295(a)(1).\nSee 535 U. S., at 830\u2013832.\n  In reaching its decision in Holmes Group, the Court first attributed to\nthe words \u201carising under\u201d in \u00a71338(a) the same meaning those words\nhave in \u00a71331. See id., at 829\u2013830. It then reasoned that a counter\nclaim asserted in a responsive pleading cannot provide the basis for\n\u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction consistently with the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule. See id., at 830\u2013832.\n10                   VADEN v.

See American Law Institute, Study\nof the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts \u00a71312,\npp. 188\u2013194 (1969) (discussed in 14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.

Under our precedent construing \u00a71331, as just\nexplained, counterclaims, even if they rely exclusively on\nfederal substantive law, do not qualify a case for federal\ncourt cognizance.\n                             III\n   Attending to the language of the FAA and the above\ndescribed jurisdictional tenets, we approve the \u201clook\nthrough\u201d approach to this extent: A federal court may\n\u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to determine whether it is\npredicated on an action that \u201carises under\u201d federal law; in\nkeeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified\nin Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not enter\ntain a \u00a74 petition based on the contents, actual or hypo\nthetical, of a counterclaim.\n                              A\n  The text of \u00a74 drives our conclusion that a federal court\nshould determine its jurisdiction by \u201clooking through\u201d a \u00a74\npetition to the parties\u2019 underlying substantive controversy.\nWe reiterate \u00a74\u2019s relevant instruction: When one party\nseeks arbitration pursuant to a written agreement and the\nother resists, the proponent of arbitration may petition for\nan order compelling arbitration in\n    \u201cany United States district court which, save for [the\n    arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under\n    title 28, in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject\n    matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between\n    the parties.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74.\nThe phrase \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement\u201d indi\ncates that the district court should assume the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement and determine whether it\n\u201cwould have jurisdiction under title 28\u201d without it. See\n396 F. 3d, at 369, 372 (case below). Jurisdiction over\nwhat? The text of \u00a74 refers us to \u201cthe controversy between\nthe parties.\u201d That phrase, the Fourth Circuit said, and we\n12                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nagree, is most straightforwardly read to mean the \u201csub\nstantive conflict between the parties.\u201d Id., at 370. See\nalso Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, n. 32 (noting in dicta\nthat, to entertain a \u00a74 petition, a federal court must have\njurisdiction over the \u201cunderlying dispute\u201d).13\n   The majority of Courts of Appeals to address the ques\ntion, we acknowledge, have rejected the \u201clook through\u201d\napproach entirely, as Vaden asks us to do here. See supra,\nat 5\u20136. The relevant \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d\nVaden insists, is simply and only the parties\u2019 discrete\ndispute over the arbitrability of their claims. She relies,\nquite reasonably, on the fact that a \u00a74 petition to compel\narbitration seeks no adjudication on the merits of the\nunderlying controversy. Indeed, its very purpose is to\nhave an arbitrator, rather than a court, resolve the merits.\nA \u00a74 petition, Vaden observes, is essentially a plea for\nspecific performance of an agreement to arbitrate, and it\nthus presents principally contractual questions: Did the\nparties validly agree to arbitrate? What issues does their\nagreement encompass? Has one party dishonored the\nagreement?\n   Vaden\u2019s argument, though reasonable, is difficult to\nsquare with the statutory language. Section 4 directs\ncourts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction\n\u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement.\u201d How, then, can a\ndispute over the existence or applicability of an arbitration\nagreement be the controversy that counts?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 The parties\u2019 underlying dispute may or may not be the subject of\n\npending litigation. This explains \u00a74\u2019s use of the conditional \u201cwould\u201d\nand the indefinite \u201ca suit.\u201d A party often files a \u00a74 petition to compel\narbitration precisely because it does not want to bring suit and litigate\nin court. Sometimes, however, a \u00a74 petition is filed after litigation has\ncommenced. The party seeking to compel arbitration in such cases is\ntypically the defendant, who claims to be aggrieved by the plaintiff\u2019s\nattempt to litigate rather than arbitrate. This case involves the rela\ntively unusual situation in which the party that initiated litigation of\nthe underlying dispute is also the party seeking to compel arbitration.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The \u201csave for\u201d clause, courts espousing the view em\nbraced by Vaden respond, means only that the \u201cantiquated\nand arcane\u201d ouster notion no longer holds sway. Drexel\nBurnham Lambert, Inc. v. Valenzuela Bock, 696 F. Supp.\n957, 961 (SDNY 1988). Adherents to this \u201couster\u201d expla\nnation of \u00a74\u2019s language recall that courts traditionally\nviewed arbitration clauses as unworthy attempts to \u201coust\u201d\nthem of jurisdiction; accordingly, to guard against en\ncroachment on their domain, they refused to order specific\nenforcement of agreements to arbitrate. See H. R. Rep.\nNo. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1\u20132 (1924) (discussed in\nDean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219\u2013220,\nand n. 6 (1985)). The \u201csave for\u201d clause, as comprehended\nby proponents of the \u201couster\u201d explanation, was designed to\nensure that courts would no longer consider themselves\nousted of jurisdiction and would therefore specifically\nenforce arbitration agreements. See, e.g., Westmoreland,\n100 F. 3d, at 267\u2013268, and n. 6 (adopting the \u201couster\u201d\ninterpretation advanced in Drexel Burnham Lambert, 696\nF.

It\nwould permit a federal court to entertain a \u00a74 petition only\nwhen a federal-question suit is already before the court,\nwhen the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of\ncitizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitra\nbility involves a maritime contract. See, e.g., Westmore\nland, 100 F. 3d, at 268\u2013269; 1 MacNeil \u00a79.2.3.1, pp. 9:12\u2013\n9:13 (when a federal-question suit has been filed in or\nremoved to federal court, the court \u201cmay order arbitration\nunder FAA \u00a74\u201d).15 Vaden\u2019s approach would not accommo\ndate a \u00a74 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit\nin (or remove such a suit to) federal court, but who has not\ndone so. In contrast, when the parties\u2019 underlying dispute\narises under federal law, the \u201clook through\u201d approach\npermits a \u00a74 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel\narbitration without first taking the formal step of initiat\ning or removing a federal-question suit\u2014that is, without\nseeking federal adjudication of the very questions it wants\nto arbitrate rather than litigate. See 1 id., \u00a79.2.3.3, p. 9:21\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Because   \u201cthe ouster problem was just as great under state law as it\nwas under federal,\u201d the absence of \u201csave for\u201d language in contempora\nneous state arbitration acts bolsters our conclusion that \u00a74 was not\ndevised to dislodge the common-law ouster doctrine. 1 I. MacNeil, R.\nSpeidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law \u00a79.2.3.3, p. 9:18\n(1995). See also 396 F. 3d 366, 369\u2013370, n. 2 (CA4 2005) (case below).\n   15 Specific jurisdiction-granting provisions may also authorize a fed\n\neral court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration. See, e.g., 9\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7203, 205 (providing for federal-court jurisdiction over arbitra\ntion agreements covered by the Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(explaining that the approach Vaden advocates \u201ccreates a\ntotally artificial distinction\u201d based on whether a dispute is\nsubject to pending federal litigation).\n                              B\n   Having determined that a district court should \u201clook\nthrough\u201d a \u00a74 petition, we now consider whether the court\n\u201cwould have [federal-question] jurisdiction\u201d over \u201ca suit\narising out of the controversy\u201d between Discover and\nVaden. 9 U. S. C. \u00a74. As explained above, \u00a74 of the FAA\ndoes not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction; rather, it con\nfines federal courts to the jurisdiction they would have\n\u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement.\u201d See supra, at 7\u20138.\nMindful of that limitation, we read \u00a74 to convey that a\nparty seeking to compel arbitration may gain a federal\ncourt\u2019s assistance only if, \u201csave for\u201d the agreement, the\nentire, actual \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d as they\nhave framed it, could be litigated in federal court. We\nconclude that the parties\u2019 actual controversy, here precipi\ntated by Discover\u2019s state-court suit for the balance due on\nVaden\u2019s account, is not amenable to federal-court adjudi\ncation. Consequently, the \u00a74 petition Discover filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland\nmust be dismissed.\n   As the Fourth Circuit initially stated, the \u201ccontroversy\nbetween the parties\u201d arose from the \u201calleged debt\u201d Vaden\nowed to Discover. 396 F. 3d, at 370. Discover\u2019s complaint\nin Maryland state court plainly did not \u201carise under\u201d\nfederal law, nor did it qualify under any other head of\nfederal-court jurisdiction. See supra, at 3, and n. 1.\n   In holding that Discover properly invoked federal-court\njurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit looked beyond Discover\u2019s\ncomplaint and homed in on Vaden\u2019s state-law-based de\nfense and counterclaims. Those responsive pleadings,\nDiscover alleged, and the Fourth Circuit determined, were\ncompletely preempted by the FDIA. See supra, at 3\u20134.\n16               VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Fourth Circuit, however, misapprehended our deci\nsion in Holmes Group. Under the well-pleaded complaint\nrule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a\ncounterclaim and thus does not provide a key capable of\nopening a federal court\u2019s door. See supra, at 8\u201311. See\nalso Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74, 75\u201376 (1914)\n(\u201c[W]hether a case is one arising under [federal law] . . .\nmust be determined from what necessarily appears in the\nplaintiff\u2019s statement of his own claim . . . , unaided by\nanything alleged in anticipation o[r] avoidance of defenses\nwhich it is thought the defendant may interpose.\u201d).\n   Neither Discover nor THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part (hereinafter dissent), defends\nthe Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Instead, the dissent in\nsists that a federal court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction over\n\u201cthe controversy Discover seeks to arbitrate\u201d\u2014namely,\n\u201cwhether \u2018Discover Bank charged illegal finance charges,\ninterest and late fees.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 1 (quoting App. 30). The\ndissent hypothesizes two federal suits that might arise\nfrom this purported controversy: \u201can action by Vaden\nasserting that the charges violate the FDIA, or one by\nDiscover seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not.\u201d\nPost, at 2.\n   There is a fundamental flaw in the dissent\u2019s analysis: In\nlieu of focusing on the whole controversy as framed by the\nparties, the dissent hypothesizes discrete controversies of\nits own design. As the parties\u2019 state-court filings reflect,\nthe originating controversy here concerns Vaden\u2019s alleged\ndebt to Discover. Vaden\u2019s responsive counterclaims chal\nlenging the legality of Discover\u2019s charges are a discrete\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden\nbrought to state court. Whether one might imagine a\nfederal-question suit involving the parties\u2019 disagreement\nover Discover\u2019s charges is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy between the\nparties\u2014not just a piece broken off from that contro\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nversy\u2014is one over which the federal courts would have\njurisdiction.\n   The dissent would have us treat a \u00a74 petitioner\u2019s state\nment of the issues to be arbitrated as the relevant contro\nversy even when that statement does not convey the full\nflavor of the parties\u2019 entire dispute. Artful dodges by a \u00a74\npetitioner should not divert us from recognizing the actual\ndimensions of that controversy. The text of \u00a74 instructs\nfederal courts to determine whether they would have\njurisdiction over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties\u201d; it does not give \u00a74 petitioners license\nto recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture\na new controversy, in an effort to obtain a federal court\u2019s\naid in compelling arbitration.16\n   Viewed contextually and straightforwardly, it is hardly\n\u201cfortuit[ous]\u201d that the controversy in this case took the\nshape it did. Cf. post, at 2. Seeking to collect a debt,\nDiscover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in\nstate court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counter\nclaims. Perhaps events could have unfolded differently,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Noting   that the FAA sometimes uses \u201ccontroversy\u201d to refer to the\ndispute to be arbitrated, the dissent insists that it must have the same\nmeaning in \u00a74. Cf. post, at 2\u20133. But \u00a74 does not ask a district court to\ndetermine whether it would have jurisdiction over \u201cthe controversy the\n\u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\u201d; it asks whether the court would have\njurisdiction over \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d Here, the issue\nDiscover seeks to arbitrate is undeniably only a fraction of the contro\nversy between the parties. We decline to rewrite the statute to ignore\nthis reality.\n   Moreover, our reading of \u00a74 fully accords with the statute\u2019s subjunc\ntive construction (\u201cwould have jurisdiction\u201d) and its reference to \u201ca\nsuit.\u201d Cf. post, at 5. Section 4, we recognize, enables a party to seek an\norder compelling arbitration even when the parties\u2019 controversy is not\nthe subject of pending litigation. See supra, at 12, n. 13, 14\u201315.\nWhether or not the controversy between the parties is embodied in an\nexisting suit, the relevant question remains the same: Would a federal\ncourt have jurisdiction over an action arising out of that full-bodied\ncontroversy?\n18                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbut \u00a74 does not invite federal courts to dream up counter\nfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties\u2019\ncontroversy.17\n   As the dissent would have it, parties could commandeer\na federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for arbitra\ntion while leaving the remainder of the parties\u2019 contro\nversy pending in state court. That seems a bizarre way to\nproceed. In this case, Vaden\u2019s counterclaims would be\nsent to arbitration while the complaint to which they are\naddressed\u2014Discover\u2019s state-law-grounded debt-collection\naction\u2014would remain pending in a Maryland court.\nWhen the controversy between the parties is not one over\nwhich a federal court would have jurisdiction, it makes\nscant sense to allow one of the parties to enlist a federal\ncourt to disturb the state-court proceedings by carving out\nissues for separate resolution.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17Our approach, the dissent asserts, would produce \u201cinconsistent\n\nresults\u201d based \u201cupon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded.\u201d Post, at 5, 6. Of course, a party\u2019s ability to gain adjudication\nof a federal question in federal court often depends on how that ques\ntion happens to have been presented, and the dissent\u2019s argument is\nlittle more than a veiled criticism of Holmes Group and the well\npleaded complaint rule. When a litigant files a state-law claim in state\ncourt, and her opponent parries with a federal counterclaim, the action\nis not removable to federal court, even though it would have been\nremovable had the order of filings been reversed. See Holmes Group,\n535 U. S., at 831\u2013832.\n      True, the outcome in this case may well have been different had\nVaden initiated an FDIA claim about the legality of Discover\u2019s charges.\nBecause that controversy likely would have been amenable to adjudica\ntion in a federal forum, Discover could have asked a federal court to\nsend the parties to arbitration. But that is not what occurred here.\nVaden did not invoke the FDIA. Indeed, she framed her counterclaims\nunder state law and clearly preferred the Maryland forum. The dis\nsent\u2019s hypothesizing about the case that might have been brought does\nnot provide a basis for federal-court jurisdiction.\n   18 The dissent observes, post, at 4, that our rule might enable a party\n\nto request a federal court\u2019s aid in compelling arbitration of a state-law\ncounterclaim that might otherwise be adjudicated in state court. But if\n                    Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                 19\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n  Furthermore, the presence of a threshold question\nwhether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is\ntotally preempted by federal law may complicate the\ndissent\u2019s \u00a74 inquiry. This case is illustrative. The dissent\nrelates that Vaden eventually conceded that FDIA \u00a727(a),\nnot Maryland law, governs the charges and fees Discover\nmay impose. Post, at 1\u20132. But because the issue is juris\ndictional, Vaden\u2019s concession is not determinative. See\nsupra, at 4\u20135, and n. 4. The dissent simply glides by the\npreemption issue, devoting no attention to it, although\nthis Court has not yet resolved the matter.\n  In sum, \u00a74 of the FAA instructs district courts asked to\ncompel arbitration to inquire whether the court would\nhave jurisdiction, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d\nover \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy between the\nparties.\u201d We read that prescription in light of the well\npleaded complaint rule and the corollary rule that federal\njurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or\ncounterclaim. Parties may not circumvent those rules by\nasking a federal court to order arbitration of the portion of\na controversy that implicates federal law when the court\nwould not have federal-question jurisdiction over the\ncontroversy as a whole. It does not suffice to show that a\nfederal question lurks somewhere inside the parties\u2019 con\ntroversy, or that a defense or counterclaim would arise\nunder federal law. Because the controversy between\nDiscover and Vaden, properly perceived, is not one qualify\ning for federal-court adjudication, \u00a74 of the FAA does not\nempower a federal court to order arbitration of that con\ntroversy, in whole or in part.19\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na federal court would have jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 whole contro\nversy, we see nothing anomalous about the court\u2019s ordering arbitration\nof a state-law claim constituting part of that controversy. Federal\ncourts routinely exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law\nclaims. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71367.\n  19 This Court\u2019s declaratory judgment jurisprudence in no way under\n20                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Discover, we note, is not left without recourse. Under\nthe FAA, state courts as well as federal courts are obliged\nto honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate. Southland,\n465 U. S., at 12; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, 26, n. 34.\nSee also supra, at 7\u20138. Discover may therefore petition a\nMaryland court for aid in enforcing the arbitration clause\nof its contracts with Maryland cardholders.\n   True, Maryland\u2019s high court has held that \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 of\nthe FAA prescribe federal-court procedures and, therefore,\ndo not bind the state courts.20 But Discover scarcely lacks\nan available state remedy. Section 2 of the FAA, which\ndoes bind the state courts, renders agreements to arbitrate\n\u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\u201d This provision \u201ccar\nries with it duties [to credit and enforce arbitration\nagreements] indistinguishable from those imposed on\nfederal courts by FAA \u00a7\u00a73 and 4.\u201d 1 MacNeil \u00a710.8.1,\np. 10:77. Notably, Maryland, like many other States,\nprovides a statutory remedy nearly identical to \u00a74. See\nMd. Cts. & Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a73\u2013207 (Lexis 2006) (\u201cIf a\nparty to an arbitration agreement . . . refuses to arbitrate,\nthe other party may file a petition with a court to order\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncuts our analysis. Cf. post, at 2, 7. Discover, the dissent implies, could\nhave brought suit in federal court seeking a declaration that its charges\nconform to federal law. Again, the dissent\u2019s position rests on its mis\nconception of \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d Like \u00a74 itself, the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act does not enlarge the jurisdiction of the\nfederal courts; it is \u201cprocedural only.\u201d Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,\n300 U. S. 227, 240 (1937). Thus, even in a declaratory judgment action,\na federal court could not entertain Discover\u2019s state-law debt-collection\nclaim. Cf. 10B Wright & Miller \u00a72758, pp. 519\u2013521 (\u201cThe Declaratory\nJudgment Act was not intended to enable a party to obtain a change of\ntribunal from a state to federal court, and it is not the function of the\nfederal declaratory action merely to anticipate a defense that otherwise\ncould be presented in a state action.\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n   20This Court has not decided whether \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 apply to proceedings\n\nin state courts, see Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.

But look through to what? The statute\nprovides a clear and sensible answer: The court may con\nsider the \u00a74 petition if the court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction\nover \u201cthe subject matter of a suit arising out of the contro\nversy between the parties.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74.\n   The \u00a74 petition in this case explains that the contro\nversy Discover seeks to arbitrate is whether \u201cDiscover\nBank charged illegal finance charges, interest and late\nfees.\u201d App. 30. Discover contends in its petition that the\nresolution of this dispute is controlled by federal law\u2014\nspecifically \u00a727(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\n(FDIA), 12 U. S. C. \u00a71831d(a) (setting forth the interest\nrates a state-chartered, federally insured bank may\ncharge \u201cnotwithstanding any State constitution or stat\nute which is hereby preempted\u201d). Vaden agrees that the\nlegality of Discover\u2019s charges and fees is governed by\n2                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe FDIA.* A federal court therefore \u201cwould have juris\ndiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of\nthe controversy\u201d Discover seeks to arbitrate. That suit\ncould be an action by Vaden asserting that the charges\nviolate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declara\ntory judgment that they do not.\n  The majority is diverted off this straightforward path by\nthe fortuity that a complaint happens to have been filed in\nthis case. Instead of looking to the controversy the \u00a74\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, the majority focuses on the\ncontroversy underlying that complaint, and asks whether\n\u201cthe whole controversy,\u201d as reflected in \u201cthe parties\u2019 state\ncourt filings,\u201d arises under federal law. Ante, at 16 (em\nphasis added). Because that litigation was commenced as\na state-law debt-collection claim, the majority concludes\nthere is no \u00a74 jurisdiction.\n  This approach is contrary to the language of \u00a74, and\nsharply restricts the ability of federal courts to enforce\nagreements to arbitrate. The \u201ccontroversy\u201d to which \u00a74\nrefers is the dispute alleged to be subject to arbitration.\nThe \u00a74 petitioner must set forth the nature of that dis\npute\u2014the one he seeks to arbitrate\u2014in the \u00a74 petition\nseeking an order to compel arbitration. Section 4 requires\nthat the petitioner be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the other party\u2019s\n\u201cfailure, neglect, or refusal . . . to arbitrate under a written\nagreement for arbitration\u201d; that language guides the\ndistrict court to the specific controversy the other party is\nunwilling to arbitrate.\n  That is clear from the FAA\u2019s repeated and consistent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Vaden has conceded that the FDIA completely pre-empts her state\nlaw counterclaims. See 489 F. 3d 594, 604, n. 10 (CA4 2007). What is\nsignificant about that concession is not Vaden\u2019s agreement on the\njurisdictional question of complete pre-emption (which we need not and\ndo not address), cf. ante, at 19, but rather her agreement that federal\nlaw\u2014the FDIA\u2014governs her allegation that Discover\u2019s charges and\nfees are illegal.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

In \u00a711(c), an\naward may be modified if \u201cimperfect in matter of form not\naffecting the merits of the controversy\u201d\u2014again, necessar\nily the controversy submitted to arbitration, and therefore\nthe subject of the award.\n   There is no reason to suppose \u201ccontroversy\u201d meant the\ncontroversy subject to arbitration everywhere else in the\nFAA, but something quite different in \u00a74. The issue is\nwhether there is jurisdiction to compel arbitration to\nresolve a controversy; why would the pertinent contro\nversy for assessing jurisdiction be anything other than the\nsame one asserted to be subject to arbitration?\n   The majority looks instead to the controversy the state\ncourt litigation seeks to resolve. This produces the odd\nresult of defining \u201ccontroversy\u201d more broadly than the \u00a74\npetition itself. Discover\u2019s petition does not seek to\narbitrate its state-law debt-collection claims, but rather\nVaden\u2019s allegation that the fees Discover has been\ncharging her (and other members of her proposed class)\nviolate the FDIA. See App. 30. The majority does not\nappear to question that there would be federal jurisdiction\nover a suit arising out of the subject matter of that\ndispute. The majority finds no jurisdiction here, however,\nbecause \u201ca federal court could not entertain Discover\u2019s\nstate-law debt-collection claim.\u201d Ante, at 20, n. 19. There\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nis no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a plainly federal\ncontroversy\u2014the FDIA dispute\u2014because there is no juris\ndiction to compel arbitration of the debt-collection dispute.\nBut why Discover should have to demonstrate federal\njurisdiction over a state-court claim it does not seek to\narbitrate is a mystery. Cf. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hos\npital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 19\u201321 (1983)\n(affirming federal-court jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition\nseeking to arbitrate only one of two disputes pending in\nstate-court litigation); Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,\n470 U. S. 213, 218\u2013221 (1985) (when litigation involves\nmultiple claims, only some of which are covered by an\narbitration agreement, district court must compel arbitra\ntion of the covered claims if so requested).\n   The majority\u2019s approach will allow federal jurisdiction to\ncompel arbitration of entirely state-law claims. Under\nthat approach the \u201ccontroversy\u201d is not the one the \u00a74\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, but a broader one encom\npassing the \u201cwhole controversy\u201d between the parties.\nAnte, at 16. If that broader dispute involves both fed\neral and state-law claims, and the \u201coriginating\u201d dispute\nis federal, ibid., a party could seek arbitration of just\nthe state-law claims. The \u201ccontroversy\u201d under the ma\njority\u2019s view would qualify as federal, giving rise to \u00a74\njurisdiction to compel arbitration of a purely state-law\nclaim.\n   Take this case as an example. If Vaden had filed her\nFDIA claim first, and Discover had responded with a\nstate-law debt-collection counterclaim, that suit is one\nthat \u201ccould be litigated in federal court.\u201d Ante, at 15. As a\nresult, the majority\u2019s approach would seem to permit\nVaden to file a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration of the\nentirely state-law-based debt-collection dispute, because\nthat dispute would be part and parcel of the \u201cfull fla\nvor[ed],\u201d \u201coriginating\u201d FDIA controversy. Ante, at 16, 17.\nDefining the controversy as the dispute the \u00a74 petitioner\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nseeks to arbitrate eliminates this problem by ensuring\nthat the actual dispute subject to arbitration is federal.\n   The majority\u2019s conclusion that this controversy \u201cis not\none qualifying for federal-court adjudication,\u201d ante, at 19,\nstems from its mistaken focus on the existing litigation.\nRather than ask whether a court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction\nover the \u201csubject matter\u201d of \u201ca\u201d suit arising out of the\n\u201ccontroversy,\u201d the majority asks only whether the court\ndoes have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a par\nticular complaint. But \u00a74 does not speak of actual juris\ndiction over pending suits; it speaks subjunctively of\nprospective jurisdiction over \u201cthe subject matter of a suit\narising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d 9\nU. S. C. \u00a74. The fact that Vaden has chosen to package\nthe FDIA controversy in counterclaims in pending state\ncourt litigation in no way means that a district court\n\u201cwould [not] have\u201d jurisdiction over the \u201csubject matter\u201d\nof \u201ca suit\u201d arising out of the FDIA controversy. A big part\nof arbitration is avoiding the procedural niceties of for\nmal litigation; it would be odd to have the authority of a\ncourt to compel arbitration hinge on just such niceties in\na pending case.\n   By focusing on the sequence in which state-court litiga\ntion has unfolded, the majority crafts a rule that pro\nduces inconsistent results. Because Discover\u2019s debt\ncollection claim was filed before Vaden\u2019s counterclaims,\nthe majority treats the debt-collection dispute as the\n\u201coriginating controversy.\u201d Ante, at 16. But nothing\nwould have prevented the same disagreements between\nthe parties from producing a different sequence of events.\nVaden could have filed a complaint raising her FDIA\nclaims before Discover sought to collect on any amounts\nVaden owes. Because the \u201coriginating controversy\u201d in\nthat complaint would be whether Discover has charged\nfees illegal under federal law, in that situation Discover\npresumably could bring a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration\n6                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof the FDIA dispute. The majority\u2019s rule thus makes \u00a74\njurisdiction over the same controversy entirely dependent\nupon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded. Nothing in \u00a74 suggests such a result.\n   The majority glosses over another problem inherent in\nits approach: In many if not most cases under \u00a74, no com\nplaint will have been filed. See Hartford Financial Sys\ntems, Inc. v. Florida Software Servs., Inc., 712 F. 2d 724,\n728 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.) (\u201cNormally, [\u00a74] motions are\nbrought in independent proceedings\u201d). What to \u201clook\nthrough\u201d to then? The majority instructs courts to look to\nthe \u201cfull-bodied controversy.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 16. But as\nthis case illustrates, that would lead to a different result\nhad the state-court complaint not been filed. Discover\ndoes not seek to arbitrate whether an outstanding debt\nexists; indeed, Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition does not even allege\nany dispute on that point. See App. 28\u201341. A district\ncourt would therefore not understand the \u00a74 \u201ccontroversy\u201d\nto include the debt-collection claim in the absence of the\nstate-court suit. Under the majority\u2019s rule, the FDIA\ndispute would be treated as a \u201ccontroversy\u201d qualifying\nunder \u00a74 before the state suit and counterclaims had been\nfiled, but not after.\n   The far more concrete and administrable approach\nwould be to apply the same rule in all instances: Look to\nthe controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\u2014as set\nforth in the \u00a74 petition\u2014and assess whether a federal\ncourt would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a\nsuit arising out of that controversy. The controversy the\nmoving party seeks to arbitrate and the other party will\nnot would be the same controversy used to assess jurisdic\ntion to compel arbitration.\n   The majority objects that this would allow a court to\n\u201chypothesiz[e] discrete controversies of its own design,\u201d\nante, at 16, in an apparent effort to find federal\njurisdiction where there is none. Not so. A district court\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nentertaining a \u00a74 petition is required to determine what \u201ca\nsuit\u201d arising out of the allegedly arbitrable controversy\nwould look like. There is no helping that, given the stat\nute\u2019s subjunctive language. But that does not mean the\ninquiry is the free-form one the majority posits.\n   To the contrary, a district court must look to the specific\ncontroversy\u2014the concrete dispute that one party has\n\u201cfail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]\u201d to arbitrate\u2014and de\ntermine whether that controversy would give rise to a suit\nunder federal law. District courts do that sort of thing\noften enough; the exercise is closely analogous to the\njurisdictional analysis in a typical declaratory judgment\naction. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction\nLaborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19\n(1983) (jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action\nexists when, \u201cif the declaratory judgment defendant\nbrought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit\nwould necessarily present a federal question\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Looking to the specific controversy outlined in\nDiscover\u2019s \u00a74 petition (whether its fees violate the FDIA),\nit hardly requires \u201cdream[ing]\u201d to conceive of a lawsuit in\nwhich Vaden would claim the FDIA has been violated and\nDiscover would claim it has not. Ante, at 18.\n   Nor would respondents\u2019 approach allow a \u00a74 petitioner\nto simply \u201crecharacterize\u201d or \u201cmanufacture\u201d a controversy\nto create federal jurisdiction. Ante, at 17. All of the\nestablished rules of federal jurisdiction are fully applicable\nin scrutinizing whether a federal court would have juris\ndiction over a suit arising out of the parties\u2019 underlying\ncontroversy.\n   For example, a federal question must be presented by\nthe specific controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbi\ntrate, not by some hypothetical federal issue \u201clurking in\nthe background.\u201d Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian,\n299 U. S. 109, 117 (1936). A district court could not com\npel arbitration of a state-law dispute by pointing to a\n8                 VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\npotential federal defense that the \u00a74 petitioner is not\nseeking to arbitrate, because the \u201cclaim itself must pre\nsent a federal question\u201d to arise under federal law. Skelly\nOil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 672\n(1950). Nor could a district court compel arbitration of a\ndispute that, though not federal in character, could lead to\nthe filing of a federal counterclaim, for \u201ca counterclaim . . .\ncannot serve as the basis for [federal] jurisdiction\u201d of the\nstate-law dispute itself. Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado\nAir Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, 831 (2002).\n    Accordingly, petitioners may no more smuggle state-law\nclaims into federal court through \u00a74 than they can through\ndeclaratory judgment actions, or any other federal cause of\naction. To the extent \u00a74 brings some issues into federal\ncourt in a particular case that may not be brought in\nthrough other procedural mechanisms, it does so by\n\u201cenlarg[ing] the range of remedies available in the federal\ncourts[,] . . . not extend[ing] their jurisdiction.\u201d Skelly Oil,\nsupra, at 671.\n    That is why the majority\u2019s recital of the basic rules of\nfederal-court jurisdiction in Part II of its opinion is beside\nthe point: No one disputes what those rules are, and no\none disputes that they must be followed under \u00a74 in\ndeciding whether a federal court \u201cwould have jurisdiction\n. . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the\ncontroversy between the parties.\u201d The issue is instead\nwhat suit should be scrutinized for compliance with those\nrules. In defining \u201ccontroversy\u201d by reference to existing\nlitigation, the majority artificially limits the reach of \u00a74 to\nthe particular suit filed. The correct approach is to accord\n\u00a74 the scope mandated by its language and look to \u201ca suit,\u201d\narising out of the \u201csubject matter\u201d of the \u201ccontroversy\u201d the\n\u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, and determine whether a\nfederal court would have jurisdiction over such a suit.\n    The majority concludes by noting that state courts are\nobliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nAnte, at 20. The question here, however, is one of remedy.\nIt is a common feature of our federal system that States\noften provide remedies similar to those under federal law\nfor the same wrongs. We do not, however, narrowly con\nstrue the federal remedies\u2014say federal antitrust or civil\nrights remedies\u2014because state law provides remedies in\nthose areas as well. Cf. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183\n(1961) (\u201cIt is no answer that the State has a law which if\nenforced would give relief\u201d).\n                           *    *   *\n  Discover and Vaden have agreed to arbitrate any\ndispute arising out of Vaden\u2019s account with Discover.\nVaden\u2019s allegations against Discover have given rise to\nsuch a dispute. Discover seeks to arbitrate that contro\nversy, but Vaden refuses to do so. Resolution of the\ncontroversy is governed by federal law, specifically the\nFDIA. There is no dispute about that. In the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement, a federal court \u201cwould have\njurisdiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out\nof the controversy between the parties,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74,\nwhether the suit were brought by Vaden or Discover. The\nDistrict Court therefore may exercise jurisdiction over this\npetition under \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n",

C. \u00a74, au\n  thorizes a United States district court to entertain a petition to com\n  pel arbitration if the court would have jurisdiction, \u201csave for [the ar\n  bitration] agreement,\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\n  between the parties.\u201d\n     Discover Bank\u2019s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Maryland\n  state court to recover past-due charges from one of its credit card\n  holders, petitioner Vaden. Discover\u2019s pleading presented a claim\n  arising solely under state law. Vaden answered and counterclaimed,\n  alleging that Discover\u2019s finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\n  lated state law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\n  agreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a \u00a74 petition in Federal\n  District Court to compel arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counterclaims. The\n  District Court ordered arbitration.\n     On Vaden\u2019s initial appeal, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case\n  for the District Court to determine whether it had subject-matter ju\n  risdiction over Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331,\n  which gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \u201carising under\u201d fed\n  eral law. The Fourth Circuit instructed the District Court to conduct\n  this inquiry by \u201clooking through\u201d the \u00a74 petition to the substantive\n  controversy between the parties. With Vaden conceding that her\n  state-law counterclaims were completely preempted by \u00a727 of the\n  Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the District Court expressly\n  held that it had federal-question jurisdiction and again ordered arbi\n  tration. The Fourth Circuit then affirmed. The Court of Appeals rec\n  ognized that, in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys\n  tems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, this Court held that federal-question\n  jurisdiction depends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\n2                     VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    may not be predicated on counterclaims. It concluded, however, that\n    the complete preemption doctrine is paramount and thus overrides\n    the well-pleaded complaint rule.\nHeld: A federal court may \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to determine\n whether it is predicated on a controversy that \u201carises under\u201d federal\n law; in keeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified in\n Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not entertain a \u00a74 peti\n tion based on the contents of a counterclaim when the whole contro\n versy between the parties does not qualify for federal-court adjudica\n tion.

If courts are to determine whether they\nwould have jurisdiction \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d how\ncan a dispute over an arbitration agreement\u2019s existence or applicabil\nity be the controversy that counts? The Court is unpersuaded that\nthe \u201csave for\u201d clause means only that the \u201cantiquated and arcane\u201d\nouster notion no longer holds sway. To the extent that the ancient\n\u201couster\u201d doctrine continued to impede specific enforcement of arbitra\ntion agreements, FAA \u00a72, the Act\u2019s \u201ccenterpiece provision,\u201d Mitsubi\nshi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 625,\ndirectly attended to the problem by commanding that an arbitration\nagreement is enforceable just as any other contract. Vaden\u2019s ap\nproach also has curious practical consequences. It would permit a\nfederal court to entertain a \u00a74 petition only when a federal-question\nsuit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the require\nments for diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute\nover arbitrability involves a maritime contract, yet would not ac\ncommodate a \u00a74 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit in,\nor remove such a suit to, federal court, but has not done so. In con\ntrast, the \u201clook through\u201d approach permits a \u00a74 petitioner to ask a\nfederal court to compel arbitration without first taking the formal\nstep of initiating or removing a federal-question suit. Pp. 11\u201315.\n   (c) Having determined that a district court should look through a\n\u00a74 petition, this Court considers whether the court \u201cwould have [fed\neral-question] jurisdiction\u201d over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\u201d\nbetween Discover and Vaden. Because \u00a74 does not enlarge federal\ncourt jurisdiction, a party seeking to compel arbitration may gain\nsuch a court\u2019s assistance only if, \u201csave for\u201d the agreement, the entire,\nactual \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d as they have framed it,\ncould be litigated in federal court. Here, the actual controversy is not\namenable to federal-court adjudication. The \u201ccontroversy between\nthe parties\u201d arose from Vaden\u2019s \u201calleged debt,\u201d a claim that plainly\ndid not \u201carise under\u201d federal law; nor did it qualify under any other\nhead of federal-court jurisdiction. The Fourth Circuit misappre\nhended Holmes Group when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper\nbecause Vaden\u2019s state-law counterclaims were completely preempted.\nUnder the well-pleaded complaint rule, a completely preempted coun\nterclaim remains a counterclaim, and thus does not provide a key ca\npable of opening a federal court\u2019s door. Vaden\u2019s responsive counter\nclaims challenging the legality of Discover\u2019s charges are merely an\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden brought to state\ncourt. Whether one might hypothesize a federal-question suit involv\ning that subsidiary disagreement is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy is one over which the fed\n4                      VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    eral courts would have jurisdiction. Section 4 does not give parties li\n    cense to recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture a\n    new controversy, in order to obtain a federal court\u2019s aid in compelling\n    arbitration. It is hardly fortuitous that the controversy in this case\n    took the shape it did. Seeking to collect a debt, Discover filed an en\n    tirely state-law-grounded complaint in state court, and Vaden chose\n    to file responsive counterclaims. Section 4 does not invite federal\n    courts to dream up counterfactuals when actual litigation has defined\n    the parties\u2019 controversy. Allowing parties to commandeer a federal\n    court to slice off responsive pleadings for discrete arbitration while\n    leaving the remainder of the parties\u2019 controversy pending in state\n    court makes scant sense. Furthermore, the presence of a threshold\n    question whether a counterclaim alleged to be based on state law is\n    totally preempted by federal law may complicate the \u00a74 inquiry. Al\n    though FAA \u00a74 does not empower a federal court to order arbitration\n    here, Discover is not left without recourse. Because the FAA obliges\n    both state and federal courts to honor and enforce arbitration agree\n    ments, Discover may petition Maryland\u2019s courts for appropriate aid\n    in enforcing the arbitration clause of its contracts with Maryland\n    credit cardholders.

S. C. \u00a74,\nauthorizes a United States district court to entertain a\npetition to compel arbitration if the court would have\njurisdiction, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d over \u201ca\nsuit arising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d\nWe consider in this opinion two questions concerning a\ndistrict court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction over a \u00a74 peti\ntion: Should a district court, if asked to compel arbitration\npursuant to \u00a74, \u201clook through\u201d the petition and grant the\nrequested relief if the court would have federal-question\njurisdiction over the underlying controversy? And if the\nanswer to that question is yes, may a district court exer\ncise jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition when the petitioner\u2019s\ncomplaint rests on state law but an actual or potential\ncounterclaim rests on federal law?\n   The litigation giving rise to these questions began when\nDiscover Bank\u2019s servicing affiliate filed a complaint in\nMaryland state court. Presenting a claim arising solely\nunder state law, Discover sought to recover past-due\ncharges from one of its credit cardholders, Betty Vaden.\n2                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden answered and counterclaimed, alleging that Dis\ncover\u2019s finance charges, interest, and late fees violated\nstate law. Invoking an arbitration clause in its cardholder\nagreement with Vaden, Discover then filed a \u00a74 petition in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Mary\nland to compel arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counterclaims. The\nDistrict Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over its\npetition, Discover maintained, because Vaden\u2019s state-law\ncounterclaims were completely preempted by federal\nbanking law. The District Court agreed and ordered\narbitration. Reasoning that a federal court has jurisdic\ntion over a \u00a74 petition if the parties\u2019 underlying dispute\npresents a federal question, the Fourth Circuit eventually\naffirmed.\n   We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part. A federal\ncourt may \u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition and order arbitra\ntion if, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d the court\nwould have jurisdiction over \u201cthe [substantive] controversy\nbetween the parties.\u201d We hold, however, that the Court of\nAppeals misidentified the dimensions of \u201cthe controversy\nbetween the parties.\u201d Focusing on only a slice of the par\nties\u2019 entire controversy, the court seized on Vaden\u2019s coun\nterclaims, held them completely preempted, and on that\nbasis affirmed the District Court\u2019s order compelling arbi\ntration.    Lost from sight was the triggering plea\u2014\nDiscover\u2019s claim for the balance due on Vaden\u2019s account.\nGiven that entirely state-based plea and the established\nrule that federal-court jurisdiction cannot be invoked on\nthe basis of a defense or counterclaim, the whole \u201ccontro\nversy between the parties\u201d does not qualify for federal\ncourt adjudication. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 judgment.\n                          I\n  This case originated as a garden-variety, state-law\nbased contract action: Discover sued its cardholder,\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nVaden, in a Maryland state court to recover arrearages\namounting to $10,610.74, plus interest and counsel fees.1\nVaden\u2019s answer asserted usury as an affirmative defense.\nVaden also filed several counterclaims, styled as class\nactions. Like Discover\u2019s complaint, Vaden\u2019s pleadings\ninvoked only state law: Vaden asserted that Discover\u2019s\ndemands for finance charges, interest, and late fees vio\nlated Maryland\u2019s credit laws. See Md. Com. Law Code\nAnn. \u00a7\u00a712\u2013506, 12\u2013506.2 (Lexis 2005). Neither party\ninvoked\u2014by notice to the other or petition to the state\ncourt\u2014the clause in the credit card agreement providing\nfor arbitration of \u201cany claim or dispute between [Discover\nand Vaden],\u201d App. 44 (capitalization and bold typeface\nomitted).2\n  Faced with Vaden\u2019s counterclaims, Discover sought\nfederal-court aid. It petitioned the United States District\nCourt for the District of Maryland for an order, pursuant\nto \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9\nU. S. C. \u00a74, compelling arbitration of Vaden\u2019s counter\nclaims.3 Although those counterclaims were framed under\nstate law, Discover urged that they were governed entirely\nby federal law, specifically, \u00a727(a) of the Federal Deposit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Discover apparently had no access to a federal forum for its suit\n\nagainst Vaden on the basis of diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.\nUnder that head of federal-court jurisdiction, the amount in contro\nversy must \u201cexcee[d] . . . $75,000.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(a).\n   2 Vaden\u2019s preference for court adjudication is unsurprising. The arbi\n\ntration clause, framed by Discover, prohibited presentation of \u201cany\nclaims as a representative or member of a class.\u201d App. 45 (capitaliza\ntion omitted).\n   3 Section 4 reads, in relevant part:\n\n   \u201cA party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of an\nother to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may\npetition any United States district court which, save for such agree\nment, would have jurisdiction under title 28, in a civil action or in\nadmiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties, for an order directing that such arbitration pro\nceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74.\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInsurance Act (FDIA), 12 U. S. C. \u00a71831d(a). Section 27(a)\nprescribes the interest rates state-chartered, federally\ninsured banks like Discover can charge, \u201cnotwithstanding\nany State constitution or statute which is hereby pre\nempted.\u201d This provision, Discover maintained, was com\npletely preemptive, i.e., it superseded otherwise applicable\nMaryland law, and placed Vaden\u2019s counterclaims under\nthe exclusive governance of the FDIA. On that basis,\nDiscover asserted, the District Court had authority to\nentertain the \u00a74 petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71331,\nwhich gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \u201carising\nunder\u201d federal law.\n   The District Court granted Discover\u2019s petition, ordered\narbitration, and stayed Vaden\u2019s prosecution of her coun\nterclaims in state court pending the outcome of arbitra\ntion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a\u201390a. On Vaden\u2019s initial\nappeal, the Fourth Circuit inquired whether the District\nCourt had federal-question jurisdiction over Discover\u2019s \u00a74\npetition. To make that determination, the Court of Ap\npeals instructed, the District Court should \u201clook through\u201d\nthe \u00a74 petition to the substantive controversy between the\nparties. 396 F. 3d 366, 369, 373 (2005). The appellate\ncourt then remanded the case for an express determina\ntion whether that controversy presented \u201ca properly in\nvoked federal question.\u201d Id., at 373.\n   On remand, Vaden \u201cconcede[d] that the FDIA com\npletely preempts any state claims against a federally\ninsured bank.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 636 (Md. 2006).\nAccepting this concession, the District Court expressly\nheld that it had federal-question jurisdiction over Dis\ncover\u2019s \u00a74 petition and again ordered arbitration. Id., at\n634\u2013636, 639. In this second round, the Fourth Circuit\naffirmed, dividing 2 to 1. 489 F. 3d 594 (2007).\n   Recognizing that \u201ca party may not create jurisdiction by\nconcession,\u201d id., at 604, n. 10, the Fourth Circuit majority\nconducted its own analysis of FDIA \u00a727(a), ultimately\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nconcluding that the provision completely preempted state\nlaw and therefore governed Vaden\u2019s counterclaims.4 This\nCourt\u2019s decision in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air\nCirculation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826 (2002), the major\nity recognized, held that federal-question jurisdiction\ndepends on the contents of a well-pleaded complaint, and\nmay not be predicated on counterclaims. 489 F. 3d, at\n600, n. 4. Nevertheless, the majority concluded, the com\nplete preemption doctrine is paramount, \u201coverrid[ing] such\nfundamental cornerstones of federal subject-matter juris\ndiction as the well-pleaded complaint rule.\u201d Ibid. (quoting\n14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice\nand Procedure \u00a73722.1, p. 511 (3d ed. 1998) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller)).5\n   The dissenting judge considered Holmes Group disposi\ntive. As \u00a727(a) of the FDIA formed no part of Discover\u2019s\ncomplaint, but came into the case only as a result of\nVaden\u2019s responsive pleadings, the dissent reasoned,\n\u201c[t]here was no \u2018properly invoked federal question\u2019 in the\nunderlying state case.\u201d 489 F. 3d, at 610.\n   We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), in view of\nthe conflict among lower federal courts on whether district\ncourts, petitioned to order arbitration pursuant to \u00a74 of\nthe FAA, may \u201clook through\u201d the petition and examine the\nparties\u2019 underlying dispute to determine whether federal\nquestion jurisdiction exists over the \u00a74 petition. Compare\nWisconsin v. Ho-Chunk Nation, 463 F. 3d 655, 659 (CA7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Our disposition of this case makes it unnecessary to take up the\n\nquestion of \u00a727(a)\u2019s preemptive force generally or in the particular\ncontext of Discover\u2019s finance charges. We therefore express no opinion\non those issues. Cf. Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U. S. 1, 9\u201310\n(2003) (holding that the National Bank Act, 12 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a785, 86,\ncompletely preempts state-law usury claims against national banks).\n  5 But see 489 F. 3d 594, 612 (CA4 2007) (dissenting opinion) (observ\n\ning that the passage from Wright & Miller referenced by the majority\n\u201cmakes clear that the doctrine of complete preemption is exclusively\nfocused on claims in a plaintiff\u2019s complaint\u201d).\n6                  VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n2006) (in determining jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition, the\ncourt may not \u201clook through\u201d the petition and focus on the\nunderlying dispute); Smith Barney, Inc. v. Sarver, 108\nF. 3d 92, 94 (CA6 1997) (same); Westmoreland Capital\nCorp. v. Findlay, 100 F. 3d 263, 267\u2013269 (CA2 1996)\n(same); and Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. v.

In support of that complaint, Discover invoked\nno federal law. When Vaden answered and counter\nclaimed, however, Discover asserted that federal law,\nspecifically \u00a727(a) of the FDIA, displaced the state laws on\nwhich Vaden relied. What counts as the underlying dis\npute in a case so postured? May Discover invoke \u00a74, not\non the basis of its own complaint, which had no federal\nelement, but on the basis of counterclaims asserted by\nVaden? To answer these questions, we first review rele\nvant provisions of the FAA, 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq., and con\ntrolling tenets of federal jurisdiction.\n                             II\n    In 1925, Congress enacted the FAA \u201c[t]o overcome judi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 In Community State Bank v.

But Judge Marcus, who authored the\ncourt\u2019s unanimous opinion, wrote a special concurrence, noting that,\nwere he writing on a clean slate, he would reject the \u201clook through\u201d\napproach.\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

See Southland, 465 U. S.,\nat 15; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, and n. 32.\n  The independent jurisdictional basis Discover relies\nupon in this case is 28 U. S.

We so ruled, emphatically, in\nHolmes Group, 535 U. S. 826. Without dissent, the Court\nheld in Holmes Group that a federal counterclaim, even\nwhen compulsory, does not establish \u201carising under\u201d juris\ndiction.10 Adhering assiduously to the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule, the Court observed, inter alia, that it would\nundermine the clarity and simplicity of that rule if federal\ncourts were obliged to consider the contents not only of the\ncomplaint but also of responsive pleadings in determining\nwhether a case \u201carises under\u201d federal law.

The Court ruled that the case did not \u201caris[e] under\u201d the\npatent laws by virtue of the patent counterclaim, and therefore held\nthat the Federal Circuit lacked appellate jurisdiction under \u00a71295(a)(1).\nSee 535 U.

See id., at 829\u2013830. It then reasoned that a counter\nclaim asserted in a responsive pleading cannot provide the basis for\n\u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction consistently with the well-pleaded com\nplaint rule.

Under our precedent construing \u00a71331, as just\nexplained, counterclaims, even if they rely exclusively on\nfederal substantive law, do not qualify a case for federal\ncourt cognizance.\n                             III\n   Attending to the language of the FAA and the above\ndescribed jurisdictional tenets, we approve the \u201clook\nthrough\u201d approach to this extent: A federal court may\n\u201clook through\u201d a \u00a74 petition to determine whether it is\npredicated on an action that \u201carises under\u201d federal law; in\nkeeping with the well-pleaded complaint rule as amplified\nin Holmes Group, however, a federal court may not enter\ntain a \u00a74 petition based on the contents, actual or hypo\nthetical, of a counterclaim.\n                              A\n  The text of \u00a74 drives our conclusion that a federal court\nshould determine its jurisdiction by \u201clooking through\u201d a \u00a74\npetition to the parties\u2019 underlying substantive controversy.\nWe reiterate \u00a74\u2019s relevant instruction: When one party\nseeks arbitration pursuant to a written agreement and the\nother resists, the proponent of arbitration may petition for\nan order compelling arbitration in\n    \u201cany United States district court which, save for [the\n    arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under\n    title 28, in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject\n    matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between\n    the parties.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74.\nThe phrase \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement\u201d indi\ncates that the district court should assume the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement and determine whether it\n\u201cwould have jurisdiction under title 28\u201d without it. See\n396 F. 3d, at 369, 372 (case below). Jurisdiction over\nwhat? The text of \u00a74 refers us to \u201cthe controversy between\nthe parties.\u201d That phrase, the Fourth Circuit said, and we\n12                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nagree, is most straightforwardly read to mean the \u201csub\nstantive conflict between the parties.\u201d Id., at 370. See\nalso Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, n. 32 (noting in dicta\nthat, to entertain a \u00a74 petition, a federal court must have\njurisdiction over the \u201cunderlying dispute\u201d).13\n   The majority of Courts of Appeals to address the ques\ntion, we acknowledge, have rejected the \u201clook through\u201d\napproach entirely, as Vaden asks us to do here. See supra,\nat 5\u20136. The relevant \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d\nVaden insists, is simply and only the parties\u2019 discrete\ndispute over the arbitrability of their claims. She relies,\nquite reasonably, on the fact that a \u00a74 petition to compel\narbitration seeks no adjudication on the merits of the\nunderlying controversy. Indeed, its very purpose is to\nhave an arbitrator, rather than a court, resolve the merits.\nA \u00a74 petition, Vaden observes, is essentially a plea for\nspecific performance of an agreement to arbitrate, and it\nthus presents principally contractual questions: Did the\nparties validly agree to arbitrate? What issues does their\nagreement encompass? Has one party dishonored the\nagreement?\n   Vaden\u2019s argument, though reasonable, is difficult to\nsquare with the statutory language. Section 4 directs\ncourts to determine whether they would have jurisdiction\n\u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement.\u201d How, then, can a\ndispute over the existence or applicability of an arbitration\nagreement be the controversy that counts?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   13 The parties\u2019 underlying dispute may or may not be the subject of\n\npending litigation. This explains \u00a74\u2019s use of the conditional \u201cwould\u201d\nand the indefinite \u201ca suit.\u201d A party often files a \u00a74 petition to compel\narbitration precisely because it does not want to bring suit and litigate\nin court. Sometimes, however, a \u00a74 petition is filed after litigation has\ncommenced. The party seeking to compel arbitration in such cases is\ntypically the defendant, who claims to be aggrieved by the plaintiff\u2019s\nattempt to litigate rather than arbitrate. This case involves the rela\ntively unusual situation in which the party that initiated litigation of\nthe underlying dispute is also the party seeking to compel arbitration.\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The \u201csave for\u201d clause, courts espousing the view em\nbraced by Vaden respond, means only that the \u201cantiquated\nand arcane\u201d ouster notion no longer holds sway.

Adherents to this \u201couster\u201d expla\nnation of \u00a74\u2019s language recall that courts traditionally\nviewed arbitration clauses as unworthy attempts to \u201coust\u201d\nthem of jurisdiction; accordingly, to guard against en\ncroachment on their domain, they refused to order specific\nenforcement of agreements to arbitrate. See H. R. Rep.\nNo. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 1\u20132 (1924) (discussed in\nDean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 219\u2013220,\nand n. 6 (1985)). The \u201csave for\u201d clause, as comprehended\nby proponents of the \u201couster\u201d explanation, was designed to\nensure that courts would no longer consider themselves\nousted of jurisdiction and would therefore specifically\nenforce arbitration agreements. See, e.g., Westmoreland,\n100 F. 3d, at 267\u2013268, and n. 6 (adopting the \u201couster\u201d\ninterpretation advanced in Drexel Burnham Lambert, 696\nF. Supp., at 961\u2013963); Strong, 485 F. 3d, at 631 (Marcus,\nJ., specially concurring) (reading \u00a74\u2019s \u201csave for\u201d clause \u201cas\ninstructing the court to \u2018set aside\u2019 not the arbitration\nagreement . . . , but merely the previous judicial hostility\nto arbitration agreements\u201d).\n   We are not persuaded that the \u201couster\u201d explanation of\n\u00a74\u2019s \u201csave for\u201d clause carries the day. To the extent that\nthe ancient \u201couster\u201d doctrine continued to impede specific\nenforcement of arbitration agreements, \u00a72 of the FAA, the\nAct\u2019s \u201ccenterpiece provision,\u201d Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v.\nSoler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.

DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSee 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal\nArbitration Law \u00a79.2.3.3, p. 9:18 (1995) (hereinafter\nMacNeil) (\u201cTh[e] effort to connect the \u2018save for\u2019 language to\nthe ancient problem of \u2018ouster of jurisdiction\u2019 is imagina\ntive, but utterly unfounded and historically inaccurate.\u201d\n(footnote omitted)).14\n   In addition to its textual implausibility, the approach\nVaden advocates has curious practical consequences. It\nwould permit a federal court to entertain a \u00a74 petition only\nwhen a federal-question suit is already before the court,\nwhen the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of\ncitizenship jurisdiction, or when the dispute over arbitra\nbility involves a maritime contract. See, e.g., Westmore\nland, 100 F. 3d, at 268\u2013269; 1 MacNeil \u00a79.2.3.1, pp. 9:12\u2013\n9:13 (when a federal-question suit has been filed in or\nremoved to federal court, the court \u201cmay order arbitration\nunder FAA \u00a74\u201d).15 Vaden\u2019s approach would not accommo\ndate a \u00a74 petitioner who could file a federal-question suit\nin (or remove such a suit to) federal court, but who has not\ndone so. In contrast, when the parties\u2019 underlying dispute\narises under federal law, the \u201clook through\u201d approach\npermits a \u00a74 petitioner to ask a federal court to compel\narbitration without first taking the formal step of initiat\ning or removing a federal-question suit\u2014that is, without\nseeking federal adjudication of the very questions it wants\nto arbitrate rather than litigate. See 1 id., \u00a79.2.3.3, p. 9:21\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Because   \u201cthe ouster problem was just as great under state law as it\nwas under federal,\u201d the absence of \u201csave for\u201d language in contempora\nneous state arbitration acts bolsters our conclusion that \u00a74 was not\ndevised to dislodge the common-law ouster doctrine. 1 I. MacNeil, R.\nSpeidel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law \u00a79.2.3.3, p. 9:18\n(1995). See also 396 F. 3d 366, 369\u2013370, n. 2 (CA4 2005) (case below).\n   15 Specific jurisdiction-granting provisions may also authorize a fed\n\neral court to entertain a petition to compel arbitration. See, e.g., 9\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7203, 205 (providing for federal-court jurisdiction over arbitra\ntion agreements covered by the Convention on the Recognition and\nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards).\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(explaining that the approach Vaden advocates \u201ccreates a\ntotally artificial distinction\u201d based on whether a dispute is\nsubject to pending federal litigation).\n                              B\n   Having determined that a district court should \u201clook\nthrough\u201d a \u00a74 petition, we now consider whether the court\n\u201cwould have [federal-question] jurisdiction\u201d over \u201ca suit\narising out of the controversy\u201d between Discover and\nVaden. 9 U. S. C. \u00a74. As explained above, \u00a74 of the FAA\ndoes not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction; rather, it con\nfines federal courts to the jurisdiction they would have\n\u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement.\u201d See supra, at 7\u20138.\nMindful of that limitation, we read \u00a74 to convey that a\nparty seeking to compel arbitration may gain a federal\ncourt\u2019s assistance only if, \u201csave for\u201d the agreement, the\nentire, actual \u201ccontroversy between the parties,\u201d as they\nhave framed it, could be litigated in federal court. We\nconclude that the parties\u2019 actual controversy, here precipi\ntated by Discover\u2019s state-court suit for the balance due on\nVaden\u2019s account, is not amenable to federal-court adjudi\ncation. Consequently, the \u00a74 petition Discover filed in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland\nmust be dismissed.\n   As the Fourth Circuit initially stated, the \u201ccontroversy\nbetween the parties\u201d arose from the \u201calleged debt\u201d Vaden\nowed to Discover. 396 F. 3d, at 370. Discover\u2019s complaint\nin Maryland state court plainly did not \u201carise under\u201d\nfederal law, nor did it qualify under any other head of\nfederal-court jurisdiction. See supra, at 3, and n. 1.\n   In holding that Discover properly invoked federal-court\njurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit looked beyond Discover\u2019s\ncomplaint and homed in on Vaden\u2019s state-law-based de\nfense and counterclaims. Those responsive pleadings,\nDiscover alleged, and the Fourth Circuit determined, were\ncompletely preempted by the FDIA. See supra, at 3\u20134.\n16               VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Fourth Circuit, however, misapprehended our deci\nsion in Holmes Group. Under the well-pleaded complaint\nrule, a completely preempted counterclaim remains a\ncounterclaim and thus does not provide a key capable of\nopening a federal court\u2019s door. See supra, at 8\u201311. See\nalso Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U. S. 74, 75\u201376 (1914)\n(\u201c[W]hether a case is one arising under [federal law] . . .\nmust be determined from what necessarily appears in the\nplaintiff\u2019s statement of his own claim . . . , unaided by\nanything alleged in anticipation o[r] avoidance of defenses\nwhich it is thought the defendant may interpose.\u201d).\n   Neither Discover nor THE CHIEF JUSTICE, concurring in\npart and dissenting in part (hereinafter dissent), defends\nthe Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Instead, the dissent in\nsists that a federal court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction over\n\u201cthe controversy Discover seeks to arbitrate\u201d\u2014namely,\n\u201cwhether \u2018Discover Bank charged illegal finance charges,\ninterest and late fees.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 1 (quoting App. 30). The\ndissent hypothesizes two federal suits that might arise\nfrom this purported controversy: \u201can action by Vaden\nasserting that the charges violate the FDIA, or one by\nDiscover seeking a declaratory judgment that they do not.\u201d\nPost, at 2.\n   There is a fundamental flaw in the dissent\u2019s analysis: In\nlieu of focusing on the whole controversy as framed by the\nparties, the dissent hypothesizes discrete controversies of\nits own design. As the parties\u2019 state-court filings reflect,\nthe originating controversy here concerns Vaden\u2019s alleged\ndebt to Discover. Vaden\u2019s responsive counterclaims chal\nlenging the legality of Discover\u2019s charges are a discrete\naspect of the whole controversy Discover and Vaden\nbrought to state court. Whether one might imagine a\nfederal-question suit involving the parties\u2019 disagreement\nover Discover\u2019s charges is beside the point. The relevant\nquestion is whether the whole controversy between the\nparties\u2014not just a piece broken off from that contro\n                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nversy\u2014is one over which the federal courts would have\njurisdiction.\n   The dissent would have us treat a \u00a74 petitioner\u2019s state\nment of the issues to be arbitrated as the relevant contro\nversy even when that statement does not convey the full\nflavor of the parties\u2019 entire dispute. Artful dodges by a \u00a74\npetitioner should not divert us from recognizing the actual\ndimensions of that controversy. The text of \u00a74 instructs\nfederal courts to determine whether they would have\njurisdiction over \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy\nbetween the parties\u201d; it does not give \u00a74 petitioners license\nto recharacterize an existing controversy, or manufacture\na new controversy, in an effort to obtain a federal court\u2019s\naid in compelling arbitration.16\n   Viewed contextually and straightforwardly, it is hardly\n\u201cfortuit[ous]\u201d that the controversy in this case took the\nshape it did. Cf. post, at 2. Seeking to collect a debt,\nDiscover filed an entirely state-law-grounded complaint in\nstate court, and Vaden chose to file responsive counter\nclaims. Perhaps events could have unfolded differently,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Noting   that the FAA sometimes uses \u201ccontroversy\u201d to refer to the\ndispute to be arbitrated, the dissent insists that it must have the same\nmeaning in \u00a74. Cf. post, at 2\u20133. But \u00a74 does not ask a district court to\ndetermine whether it would have jurisdiction over \u201cthe controversy the\n\u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\u201d; it asks whether the court would have\njurisdiction over \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d Here, the issue\nDiscover seeks to arbitrate is undeniably only a fraction of the contro\nversy between the parties. We decline to rewrite the statute to ignore\nthis reality.\n   Moreover, our reading of \u00a74 fully accords with the statute\u2019s subjunc\ntive construction (\u201cwould have jurisdiction\u201d) and its reference to \u201ca\nsuit.\u201d Cf. post, at 5. Section 4, we recognize, enables a party to seek an\norder compelling arbitration even when the parties\u2019 controversy is not\nthe subject of pending litigation. See supra, at 12, n. 13, 14\u201315.\nWhether or not the controversy between the parties is embodied in an\nexisting suit, the relevant question remains the same: Would a federal\ncourt have jurisdiction over an action arising out of that full-bodied\ncontroversy?\n18                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbut \u00a74 does not invite federal courts to dream up counter\nfactuals when actual litigation has defined the parties\u2019\ncontroversy.17\n   As the dissent would have it, parties could commandeer\na federal court to slice off responsive pleadings for arbitra\ntion while leaving the remainder of the parties\u2019 contro\nversy pending in state court. That seems a bizarre way to\nproceed. In this case, Vaden\u2019s counterclaims would be\nsent to arbitration while the complaint to which they are\naddressed\u2014Discover\u2019s state-law-grounded debt-collection\naction\u2014would remain pending in a Maryland court.\nWhen the controversy between the parties is not one over\nwhich a federal court would have jurisdiction, it makes\nscant sense to allow one of the parties to enlist a federal\ncourt to disturb the state-court proceedings by carving out\nissues for separate resolution.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17Our approach, the dissent asserts, would produce \u201cinconsistent\n\nresults\u201d based \u201cupon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded.\u201d Post, at 5, 6. Of course, a party\u2019s ability to gain adjudication\nof a federal question in federal court often depends on how that ques\ntion happens to have been presented, and the dissent\u2019s argument is\nlittle more than a veiled criticism of Holmes Group and the well\npleaded complaint rule. When a litigant files a state-law claim in state\ncourt, and her opponent parries with a federal counterclaim, the action\nis not removable to federal court, even though it would have been\nremovable had the order of filings been reversed. See Holmes Group,\n535 U. S., at 831\u2013832.\n      True, the outcome in this case may well have been different had\nVaden initiated an FDIA claim about the legality of Discover\u2019s charges.\nBecause that controversy likely would have been amenable to adjudica\ntion in a federal forum, Discover could have asked a federal court to\nsend the parties to arbitration. But that is not what occurred here.\nVaden did not invoke the FDIA. Indeed, she framed her counterclaims\nunder state law and clearly preferred the Maryland forum. The dis\nsent\u2019s hypothesizing about the case that might have been brought does\nnot provide a basis for federal-court jurisdiction.\n   18 The dissent observes, post, at 4, that our rule might enable a party\n\nto request a federal court\u2019s aid in compelling arbitration of a state-law\ncounterclaim that might otherwise be adjudicated in state court.

This case is illustrative. The dissent\nrelates that Vaden eventually conceded that FDIA \u00a727(a),\nnot Maryland law, governs the charges and fees Discover\nmay impose. Post, at 1\u20132. But because the issue is juris\ndictional, Vaden\u2019s concession is not determinative. See\nsupra, at 4\u20135, and n. 4. The dissent simply glides by the\npreemption issue, devoting no attention to it, although\nthis Court has not yet resolved the matter.\n  In sum, \u00a74 of the FAA instructs district courts asked to\ncompel arbitration to inquire whether the court would\nhave jurisdiction, \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement,\u201d\nover \u201ca suit arising out of the controversy between the\nparties.\u201d We read that prescription in light of the well\npleaded complaint rule and the corollary rule that federal\njurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or\ncounterclaim. Parties may not circumvent those rules by\nasking a federal court to order arbitration of the portion of\na controversy that implicates federal law when the court\nwould not have federal-question jurisdiction over the\ncontroversy as a whole. It does not suffice to show that a\nfederal question lurks somewhere inside the parties\u2019 con\ntroversy, or that a defense or counterclaim would arise\nunder federal law. Because the controversy between\nDiscover and Vaden, properly perceived, is not one qualify\ning for federal-court adjudication, \u00a74 of the FAA does not\nempower a federal court to order arbitration of that con\ntroversy, in whole or in part.19\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na federal court would have jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 whole contro\nversy, we see nothing anomalous about the court\u2019s ordering arbitration\nof a state-law claim constituting part of that controversy. Federal\ncourts routinely exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law\nclaims. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71367.\n  19 This Court\u2019s declaratory judgment jurisprudence in no way under\n20                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Discover, we note, is not left without recourse. Under\nthe FAA, state courts as well as federal courts are obliged\nto honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate. Southland,\n465 U. S., at 12; Moses H. Cone, 460 U. S., at 25, 26, n. 34.\nSee also supra, at 7\u20138. Discover may therefore petition a\nMaryland court for aid in enforcing the arbitration clause\nof its contracts with Maryland cardholders.\n   True, Maryland\u2019s high court has held that \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 of\nthe FAA prescribe federal-court procedures and, therefore,\ndo not bind the state courts.20 But Discover scarcely lacks\nan available state remedy. Section 2 of the FAA, which\ndoes bind the state courts, renders agreements to arbitrate\n\u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\u201d This provision \u201ccar\nries with it duties [to credit and enforce arbitration\nagreements] indistinguishable from those imposed on\nfederal courts by FAA \u00a7\u00a73 and 4.\u201d 1 MacNeil \u00a710.8.1,\np. 10:77. Notably, Maryland, like many other States,\nprovides a statutory remedy nearly identical to \u00a74. See\nMd. Cts. & Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a73\u2013207 (Lexis 2006) (\u201cIf a\nparty to an arbitration agreement . . . refuses to arbitrate,\nthe other party may file a petition with a court to order\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncuts our analysis. Cf. post, at 2, 7. Discover, the dissent implies, could\nhave brought suit in federal court seeking a declaration that its charges\nconform to federal law. Again, the dissent\u2019s position rests on its mis\nconception of \u201cthe controversy between the parties.\u201d Like \u00a74 itself, the\nDeclaratory Judgment Act does not enlarge the jurisdiction of the\nfederal courts; it is \u201cprocedural only.\u201d Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,\n300 U. S. 227, 240 (1937). Thus, even in a declaratory judgment action,\na federal court could not entertain Discover\u2019s state-law debt-collection\nclaim.

But look through to what? The statute\nprovides a clear and sensible answer: The court may con\nsider the \u00a74 petition if the court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction\nover \u201cthe subject matter of a suit arising out of the contro\nversy between the parties.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74.\n   The \u00a74 petition in this case explains that the contro\nversy Discover seeks to arbitrate is whether \u201cDiscover\nBank charged illegal finance charges, interest and late\nfees.\u201d App. 30. Discover contends in its petition that the\nresolution of this dispute is controlled by federal law\u2014\nspecifically \u00a727(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\n(FDIA), 12 U. S. C. \u00a71831d(a) (setting forth the interest\nrates a state-chartered, federally insured bank may\ncharge \u201cnotwithstanding any State constitution or stat\nute which is hereby preempted\u201d). Vaden agrees that the\nlegality of Discover\u2019s charges and fees is governed by\n2                   VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe FDIA.* A federal court therefore \u201cwould have juris\ndiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of\nthe controversy\u201d Discover seeks to arbitrate. That suit\ncould be an action by Vaden asserting that the charges\nviolate the FDIA, or one by Discover seeking a declara\ntory judgment that they do not.\n  The majority is diverted off this straightforward path by\nthe fortuity that a complaint happens to have been filed in\nthis case. Instead of looking to the controversy the \u00a74\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, the majority focuses on the\ncontroversy underlying that complaint, and asks whether\n\u201cthe whole controversy,\u201d as reflected in \u201cthe parties\u2019 state\ncourt filings,\u201d arises under federal law. Ante, at 16 (em\nphasis added). Because that litigation was commenced as\na state-law debt-collection claim, the majority concludes\nthere is no \u00a74 jurisdiction.\n  This approach is contrary to the language of \u00a74, and\nsharply restricts the ability of federal courts to enforce\nagreements to arbitrate. The \u201ccontroversy\u201d to which \u00a74\nrefers is the dispute alleged to be subject to arbitration.\nThe \u00a74 petitioner must set forth the nature of that dis\npute\u2014the one he seeks to arbitrate\u2014in the \u00a74 petition\nseeking an order to compel arbitration. Section 4 requires\nthat the petitioner be \u201caggrieved\u201d by the other party\u2019s\n\u201cfailure, neglect, or refusal . . . to arbitrate under a written\nagreement for arbitration\u201d; that language guides the\ndistrict court to the specific controversy the other party is\nunwilling to arbitrate.\n  That is clear from the FAA\u2019s repeated and consistent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Vaden has conceded that the FDIA completely pre-empts her state\nlaw counterclaims. See 489 F. 3d 594, 604, n. 10 (CA4 2007). What is\nsignificant about that concession is not Vaden\u2019s agreement on the\njurisdictional question of complete pre-emption (which we need not and\ndo not address), cf. ante, at 19, but rather her agreement that federal\nlaw\u2014the FDIA\u2014governs her allegation that Discover\u2019s charges and\nfees are illegal.\n                 Cite as: 556 U.

J.\n\nuse of the term \u201ccontroversy\u201d to mean the specific dispute\nasserted to be subject to arbitration, not to some broader,\n\u201cfull flavor[ed]\u201d or \u201cfull-bodied\u201d notion of the disagreement\nbetween the parties. Ante, at 17, and n. 16. In \u00a72, for\nexample, the \u201ccontroversy\u201d is the one \u201cto [be] settle[d] by\narbitration\u201d and the one \u201cto [be] submit[ted] to\narbitration.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72. In \u00a710(a)(3), it is a ground for\nvacating an arbitration award that the arbitrator refused\nto hear evidence \u201cpertinent and material to the\ncontroversy\u201d\u2014obviously the \u201ccontroversy\u201d subject to\narbitration, or the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to consider the\nevidence would hardly be objectionable. In \u00a711(c), an\naward may be modified if \u201cimperfect in matter of form not\naffecting the merits of the controversy\u201d\u2014again, necessar\nily the controversy submitted to arbitration, and therefore\nthe subject of the award.\n   There is no reason to suppose \u201ccontroversy\u201d meant the\ncontroversy subject to arbitration everywhere else in the\nFAA, but something quite different in \u00a74. The issue is\nwhether there is jurisdiction to compel arbitration to\nresolve a controversy; why would the pertinent contro\nversy for assessing jurisdiction be anything other than the\nsame one asserted to be subject to arbitration?\n   The majority looks instead to the controversy the state\ncourt litigation seeks to resolve. This produces the odd\nresult of defining \u201ccontroversy\u201d more broadly than the \u00a74\npetition itself. Discover\u2019s petition does not seek to\narbitrate its state-law debt-collection claims, but rather\nVaden\u2019s allegation that the fees Discover has been\ncharging her (and other members of her proposed class)\nviolate the FDIA. See App. 30. The majority does not\nappear to question that there would be federal jurisdiction\nover a suit arising out of the subject matter of that\ndispute. The majority finds no jurisdiction here, however,\nbecause \u201ca federal court could not entertain Discover\u2019s\nstate-law debt-collection claim.\u201d Ante, at 20, n. 19. There\n4                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nis no jurisdiction to compel arbitration of a plainly federal\ncontroversy\u2014the FDIA dispute\u2014because there is no juris\ndiction to compel arbitration of the debt-collection dispute.\nBut why Discover should have to demonstrate federal\njurisdiction over a state-court claim it does not seek to\narbitrate is a mystery. Cf. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hos\npital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 19\u201321 (1983)\n(affirming federal-court jurisdiction over a \u00a74 petition\nseeking to arbitrate only one of two disputes pending in\nstate-court litigation); Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd,\n470 U. S. 213, 218\u2013221 (1985) (when litigation involves\nmultiple claims, only some of which are covered by an\narbitration agreement, district court must compel arbitra\ntion of the covered claims if so requested).\n   The majority\u2019s approach will allow federal jurisdiction to\ncompel arbitration of entirely state-law claims. Under\nthat approach the \u201ccontroversy\u201d is not the one the \u00a74\npetitioner seeks to arbitrate, but a broader one encom\npassing the \u201cwhole controversy\u201d between the parties.\nAnte, at 16. If that broader dispute involves both fed\neral and state-law claims, and the \u201coriginating\u201d dispute\nis federal, ibid., a party could seek arbitration of just\nthe state-law claims. The \u201ccontroversy\u201d under the ma\njority\u2019s view would qualify as federal, giving rise to \u00a74\njurisdiction to compel arbitration of a purely state-law\nclaim.\n   Take this case as an example. If Vaden had filed her\nFDIA claim first, and Discover had responded with a\nstate-law debt-collection counterclaim, that suit is one\nthat \u201ccould be litigated in federal court.\u201d Ante, at 15. As a\nresult, the majority\u2019s approach would seem to permit\nVaden to file a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration of the\nentirely state-law-based debt-collection dispute, because\nthat dispute would be part and parcel of the \u201cfull fla\nvor[ed],\u201d \u201coriginating\u201d FDIA controversy.

J.\n\nseeks to arbitrate eliminates this problem by ensuring\nthat the actual dispute subject to arbitration is federal.\n   The majority\u2019s conclusion that this controversy \u201cis not\none qualifying for federal-court adjudication,\u201d ante, at 19,\nstems from its mistaken focus on the existing litigation.\nRather than ask whether a court \u201cwould have\u201d jurisdiction\nover the \u201csubject matter\u201d of \u201ca\u201d suit arising out of the\n\u201ccontroversy,\u201d the majority asks only whether the court\ndoes have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a par\nticular complaint. But \u00a74 does not speak of actual juris\ndiction over pending suits; it speaks subjunctively of\nprospective jurisdiction over \u201cthe subject matter of a suit\narising out of the controversy between the parties.\u201d 9\nU. S. C. \u00a74. The fact that Vaden has chosen to package\nthe FDIA controversy in counterclaims in pending state\ncourt litigation in no way means that a district court\n\u201cwould [not] have\u201d jurisdiction over the \u201csubject matter\u201d\nof \u201ca suit\u201d arising out of the FDIA controversy. A big part\nof arbitration is avoiding the procedural niceties of for\nmal litigation; it would be odd to have the authority of a\ncourt to compel arbitration hinge on just such niceties in\na pending case.\n   By focusing on the sequence in which state-court litiga\ntion has unfolded, the majority crafts a rule that pro\nduces inconsistent results. Because Discover\u2019s debt\ncollection claim was filed before Vaden\u2019s counterclaims,\nthe majority treats the debt-collection dispute as the\n\u201coriginating controversy.\u201d Ante, at 16. But nothing\nwould have prevented the same disagreements between\nthe parties from producing a different sequence of events.\nVaden could have filed a complaint raising her FDIA\nclaims before Discover sought to collect on any amounts\nVaden owes. Because the \u201coriginating controversy\u201d in\nthat complaint would be whether Discover has charged\nfees illegal under federal law, in that situation Discover\npresumably could bring a \u00a74 petition to compel arbitration\n6                VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nof the FDIA dispute. The majority\u2019s rule thus makes \u00a74\njurisdiction over the same controversy entirely dependent\nupon the happenstance of how state-court litigation has\nunfolded. Nothing in \u00a74 suggests such a result.\n   The majority glosses over another problem inherent in\nits approach: In many if not most cases under \u00a74, no com\nplaint will have been filed. See Hartford Financial Sys\ntems, Inc. v. Florida Software Servs., Inc., 712 F. 2d 724,\n728 (CA1 1983) (Breyer, J.) (\u201cNormally, [\u00a74] motions are\nbrought in independent proceedings\u201d). What to \u201clook\nthrough\u201d to then? The majority instructs courts to look to\nthe \u201cfull-bodied controversy.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 16. But as\nthis case illustrates, that would lead to a different result\nhad the state-court complaint not been filed. Discover\ndoes not seek to arbitrate whether an outstanding debt\nexists; indeed, Discover\u2019s \u00a74 petition does not even allege\nany dispute on that point. See App. 28\u201341. A district\ncourt would therefore not understand the \u00a74 \u201ccontroversy\u201d\nto include the debt-collection claim in the absence of the\nstate-court suit. Under the majority\u2019s rule, the FDIA\ndispute would be treated as a \u201ccontroversy\u201d qualifying\nunder \u00a74 before the state suit and counterclaims had been\nfiled, but not after.\n   The far more concrete and administrable approach\nwould be to apply the same rule in all instances: Look to\nthe controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate\u2014as set\nforth in the \u00a74 petition\u2014and assess whether a federal\ncourt would have jurisdiction over the subject matter of a\nsuit arising out of that controversy. The controversy the\nmoving party seeks to arbitrate and the other party will\nnot would be the same controversy used to assess jurisdic\ntion to compel arbitration.\n   The majority objects that this would allow a court to\n\u201chypothesiz[e] discrete controversies of its own design,\u201d\nante, at 16, in an apparent effort to find federal\njurisdiction where there is none. Not so. A district court\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nentertaining a \u00a74 petition is required to determine what \u201ca\nsuit\u201d arising out of the allegedly arbitrable controversy\nwould look like. There is no helping that, given the stat\nute\u2019s subjunctive language. But that does not mean the\ninquiry is the free-form one the majority posits.\n   To the contrary, a district court must look to the specific\ncontroversy\u2014the concrete dispute that one party has\n\u201cfail[ed], neglect[ed], or refus[ed]\u201d to arbitrate\u2014and de\ntermine whether that controversy would give rise to a suit\nunder federal law. District courts do that sort of thing\noften enough; the exercise is closely analogous to the\njurisdictional analysis in a typical declaratory judgment\naction. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction\nLaborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19\n(1983) (jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action\nexists when, \u201cif the declaratory judgment defendant\nbrought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit\nwould necessarily present a federal question\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Looking to the specific controversy outlined in\nDiscover\u2019s \u00a74 petition (whether its fees violate the FDIA),\nit hardly requires \u201cdream[ing]\u201d to conceive of a lawsuit in\nwhich Vaden would claim the FDIA has been violated and\nDiscover would claim it has not. Ante, at 18.\n   Nor would respondents\u2019 approach allow a \u00a74 petitioner\nto simply \u201crecharacterize\u201d or \u201cmanufacture\u201d a controversy\nto create federal jurisdiction. Ante, at 17. All of the\nestablished rules of federal jurisdiction are fully applicable\nin scrutinizing whether a federal court would have juris\ndiction over a suit arising out of the parties\u2019 underlying\ncontroversy.\n   For example, a federal question must be presented by\nthe specific controversy the \u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbi\ntrate, not by some hypothetical federal issue \u201clurking in\nthe background.\u201d Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian,\n299 U. S. 109, 117 (1936). A district court could not com\npel arbitration of a state-law dispute by pointing to a\n8                 VADEN v. DISCOVER BANK\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\npotential federal defense that the \u00a74 petitioner is not\nseeking to arbitrate, because the \u201cclaim itself must pre\nsent a federal question\u201d to arise under federal law. Skelly\nOil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 672\n(1950). Nor could a district court compel arbitration of a\ndispute that, though not federal in character, could lead to\nthe filing of a federal counterclaim, for \u201ca counterclaim . . .\ncannot serve as the basis for [federal] jurisdiction\u201d of the\nstate-law dispute itself. Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado\nAir Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U. S. 826, 831 (2002).\n    Accordingly, petitioners may no more smuggle state-law\nclaims into federal court through \u00a74 than they can through\ndeclaratory judgment actions, or any other federal cause of\naction. To the extent \u00a74 brings some issues into federal\ncourt in a particular case that may not be brought in\nthrough other procedural mechanisms, it does so by\n\u201cenlarg[ing] the range of remedies available in the federal\ncourts[,] . . . not extend[ing] their jurisdiction.\u201d Skelly Oil,\nsupra, at 671.\n    That is why the majority\u2019s recital of the basic rules of\nfederal-court jurisdiction in Part II of its opinion is beside\nthe point: No one disputes what those rules are, and no\none disputes that they must be followed under \u00a74 in\ndeciding whether a federal court \u201cwould have jurisdiction\n. . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the\ncontroversy between the parties.\u201d The issue is instead\nwhat suit should be scrutinized for compliance with those\nrules. In defining \u201ccontroversy\u201d by reference to existing\nlitigation, the majority artificially limits the reach of \u00a74 to\nthe particular suit filed. The correct approach is to accord\n\u00a74 the scope mandated by its language and look to \u201ca suit,\u201d\narising out of the \u201csubject matter\u201d of the \u201ccontroversy\u201d the\n\u00a74 petitioner seeks to arbitrate, and determine whether a\nfederal court would have jurisdiction over such a suit.\n    The majority concludes by noting that state courts are\nobliged to honor and enforce agreements to arbitrate.\n                  Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nAnte, at 20. The question here, however, is one of remedy.\nIt is a common feature of our federal system that States\noften provide remedies similar to those under federal law\nfor the same wrongs. We do not, however, narrowly con\nstrue the federal remedies\u2014say federal antitrust or civil\nrights remedies\u2014because state law provides remedies in\nthose areas as well. Cf. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183\n(1961) (\u201cIt is no answer that the State has a law which if\nenforced would give relief\u201d).\n                           *    *   *\n  Discover and Vaden have agreed to arbitrate any\ndispute arising out of Vaden\u2019s account with Discover.\nVaden\u2019s allegations against Discover have given rise to\nsuch a dispute. Discover seeks to arbitrate that contro\nversy, but Vaden refuses to do so. Resolution of the\ncontroversy is governed by federal law, specifically the\nFDIA. There is no dispute about that. In the absence of\nthe arbitration agreement, a federal court \u201cwould have\njurisdiction . . . of the subject matter of a suit arising out\nof the controversy between the parties,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a74,\nwhether the suit were brought by Vaden or Discover. The\nDistrict Court therefore may exercise jurisdiction over this\npetition under \u00a74 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n</pre>",
