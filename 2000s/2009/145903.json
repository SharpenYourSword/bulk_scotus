Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07\u2013499.      Argued November 5, 2008\u2014Decided March 3, 2009\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars an alien from obtain\n  ing refugee status in this country if he \u201cassisted, or otherwise partici\n  pated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\n  nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n  opinion.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(42). This so-called \u201cpersecutor bar\u201d ap\n  plies to those seeking asylum or withholding of removal, but does not\n  disqualify an alien from receiving a temporary deferral of removal\n  under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\n  Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). During the time peti\n  tioner, an Eritrean national, was forced to work as a prison guard in\n  that country, the prisoners he guarded were persecuted on grounds\n  protected under \u00a71101(a)(42). After escaping to the United States,\n  petitioner applied for asylum and withholding of removal. Conclud\n  ing that he assisted in the persecution of prisoners by working as an\n  armed guard, the Immigration Judge denied relief on the basis of the\n  persecutor bar, but granted deferral of removal under CAT because\n  petitioner was likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea. The Board\n  of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in all respects, holding, inter\n  alia, that the persecutor bar applies even if the alien\u2019s assistance in\n  persecution was coerced or otherwise the product of duress. The BIA\n  followed its earlier decisions finding Fedorenko v. United States, 449\n  U. S. 490, controlling. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, relying on its\n  precedent following the same reasoning.\nHeld: The BIA and Fifth Circuit misapplied Fedorenko as mandating\n that whether an alien is compelled to assist in persecution is immate\n rial for prosecutor-bar purposes. The BIA must interpret the statute,\n free from this mistaken legal premise, in the first instance. Pp. 4\u201312.\n    (a) Under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\n2                         NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842\u2013843, the BIA is entitled to deference in\n    interpreting ambiguous INA provisions, see, e.g., INS v. Aguirre-\n    Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424\u2013425. When the BIA has not spoken on \u201ca\n    matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands,\u201d this Court\u2019s\n    ordinary rule is to remand to allow \u201cthe BIA . . . to address the mat\n    ter in the first instance in light of its own experience.\u201d INS v. Or\n    lando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16\u201317. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) As there is substance both to petitioner\u2019s contention that invol\n    untary acts cannot implicate the persecutor bar because \u201cpersecu\n    tion\u201d presumes moral blameworthiness, and to the Government\u2019s ar\n    gument that the question at issue is answered by the statute\u2019s failure\n    to provide an exception for coerced conduct, it must be concluded that\n    the INA has an ambiguity that the BIA should address in the first in\n    stance. Fedorenko, which addressed a different statute enacted for a\n    different purpose, does not control the BIA\u2019s interpretation of this\n    persecutor bar. In holding that voluntariness was not required with\n    respect to such a bar in the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), Fe\n    dorenko contrasted the omission there of the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d with\n    the word\u2019s inclusion in a related statutory subsection. 449 U. S., at\n    512. Because Congress did not use the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d anywhere in\n    the persecutor bar at issue here, its omission cannot carry the same\n    significance as it did in Fedorenko. Moreover, the DPA\u2019s exclusion of\n    even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in perse\n    cution was enacted in part to address the Holocaust and its horror,\n    see id., at 511, n. 32, whereas the persecutor bar in this case was en\n    acted as part of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was designed to pro\n    vide a general rule for the ongoing treatment of all refugees and dis\n    placed persons, see, e.g., Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 427. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (c) Whether a BIA determination that the persecution bar contains\n    no exception for coerced conduct would be reasonable, and thus owed\n    Chevron deference, is a legitimate question; but it is not presented\n    here. In denying petitioner relief, the BIA recited a rule it has devel\n    oped in its cases: An alien\u2019s motivation and intent are irrelevant to\n    the issue whether he \u201cassisted\u201d in persecution; rather, his actions\u2019 ob\n    jective effect controls. A reading of those decisions confirms that the\n    BIA has not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead, has\n    deemed its interpretation to be mandated by Fedorenko. This error\n    prevented the BIA from fully considering the statutory question pre\n    sented. Its mistaken assumption stems from a failure to recognize\n    the inapplicability of the statutory construction principle invoked in\n    Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differences in statu\n    tory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply the Fedorenko rule to\n    the persecutor bar here at issue.

Pp. 8\u201310.\n     (d) Because the BIA has not yet exercised its Chevron discretion to\n  interpret the statute, the proper course is to remand to it for addi\n  tional investigation or explanation, e.g., Gonzales v. Thomas, 547\n  U. S. 183, 186, allowing it to bring its expertise to bear on the matter,\n  evaluate the evidence, make an initial determination, and thereby\n  help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway\n  that the law provides, e.g., id., at 186\u2013187.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  An alien who fears persecution in his homeland and\nseeks refugee status in this country is barred from obtain\ning that relief if he has persecuted others.\n    \u201cThe term \u2018refugee\u2019 does not include any person who\n    ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in\n    the persecution of any person on account of race, relig\n    ion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n    group, or political opinion.\u201d     Immigration and Na\n    tionality Act (INA), \u00a7101, 66 Stat. 166, as added by\n    Refugee Act of 1980, \u00a7201(a), 94 Stat. 102\u2013103, 8\n    U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(42).\nThis so-called \u201cpersecutor bar\u201d applies to those seeking\nasylum, \u00a71158(b)(2)(A)(i), or withholding of removal,\n\u00a71231(b)(3)(B)(i). It does not disqualify an alien from\nreceiving a temporary deferral of removal under the Con\nvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), art. 3, Dec.\n10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, p. 20, 1465 U. N. T. S.\n85; 8 CFR \u00a71208.17(a) (2008).\n  In this case the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n2                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined that the persecutor bar applies even if the\nalien\u2019s assistance in persecution was coerced or otherwise\nthe product of duress. In so ruling the BIA followed its\nearlier decisions that found Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), controlling. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit, in affirming the agency, relied on its\nprecedent following the same reasoning. We hold that the\nBIA and the Court of Appeals misapplied Fedorenko. We\nreverse and remand for the agency to interpret the stat\nute, free from the error, in the first instance.\n                                 I\n   Petitioner in this Court is Daniel Girmai Negusie, a\ndual national of Eritrea and Ethiopia, his father having\nbeen a national of the former and his mother of the latter.\nBorn and educated in Ethiopia, he left there for Eritrea\naround the age of 18 to see his mother and find employ\nment. The year was 1994. After a few months in Eritrea,\nstate officials took custody of petitioner and others when\nthey were attending a movie. He was forced to perform\nhard labor for a month and then was conscripted into the\nmilitary for a time. War broke out between Ethiopia and\nEritrea in 1998, and he was conscripted again.\n   When petitioner refused to fight against Ethiopia, his\nother homeland, the Eritrean Government incarcerated\nhim. Prison guards punished petitioner by beating him\nwith sticks and placing him in the hot sun. He was re\nleased after two years and forced to work as a prison\nguard, a duty he performed on a rotating basis for about\nfour years. It is undisputed that the prisoners he guarded\nwere being persecuted on account of a protected ground\u2014\ni.e., \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(42).\nPetitioner testified that he carried a gun, guarded the gate\nto prevent escape, and kept prisoners from taking showers\nand obtaining fresh air. He also guarded prisoners to\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmake sure they stayed in the sun, which he knew was a\nform of punishment. He saw at least one man die after\nbeing in the sun for more than two hours. Petitioner\ntestified that he had not shot at or directly punished any\nprisoner and that he helped prisoners on various occa\nsions. Petitioner escaped from the prison and hid in a\ncontainer, which was loaded on board a ship heading to\nthe United States. Once here he applied for asylum and\nwithholding of removal.\n   In a careful opinion the Immigration Judge, W. Wayne\nStogner, found that petitioner\u2019s testimony, for the most\npart, was credible. He concluded that petitioner assisted\nin persecution by working as an armed guard. The judge\ndetermined that although \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to establish\nthat [petitioner] is a malicious person or that he was an\naggressive person who mistreated the prisoners, . . . the\nvery fact that he helped [the government] in the prison\ncompound where he had reason to know that they were\npersecuted constitutes assisting in the persecution of\nothers and bars [petitioner] from\u201d obtaining asylum or\nwithholding of removal. App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a\u201317a\n(citing, inter alia, Fedorenko, supra). The judge, however,\ngranted deferral of removal under CAT because petitioner\nwas likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea.\n   The BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding.\nIt noted petitioner\u2019s role as an armed guard in a facility\nwhere \u201cprisoners were tortured and left to die out in the\nsun . . . on account of a protected ground.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 6a. The BIA held that \u201c[t]he fact that [petitioner]\nwas compelled to participate as a prison guard, and may\nnot have actively tortured or mistreated anyone, is imma\nterial.\u201d Ibid. That is because \u201c \u2018an alien\u2019s motivation and\nintent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he \u201cassisted\u201d\nin persecution . . . [I]t is the objective effect of an alien\u2019s\nactions which is controlling.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Matter of\nFedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57, 69 (BIA 1984)). The BIA\n4                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalso affirmed the grant of deferral of removal under CAT.\n  On petition for review the Court of Appeals agreed with\nthe BIA that whether an alien is compelled to assist in\npersecution is immaterial for persecutor-bar purposes.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 2a (citing Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at\n512, n. 34). We granted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                             II\n  Consistent with the rule in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,\n842\u2013843 (1984), the BIA is entitled to deference in inter\npreting ambiguous provisions of the INA. The question\nhere is whether an alien who was compelled to assist in\npersecution can be eligible for asylum or withholding of\nremoval. We conclude that the BIA misapplied our prece\ndent in Fedorenko as mandating that an alien\u2019s motivation\nand intent are irrelevant to the issue whether an alien\nassisted in persecution. The agency must confront the\nsame question free of this mistaken legal premise.\n                              A\n   It is well settled that \u201cprinciples of Chevron deference\nare applicable to this statutory scheme.\u201d INS v. Aguirre-\nAguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424 (1999). Congress has charged\nthe Attorney General with administering the INA, and a\n\u201cruling by the Attorney General with respect to all ques\ntions of law shall be controlling.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(a)(1).\nJudicial deference in the immigration context is of special\nimportance, for executive officials \u201cexercise especially\nsensitive political functions that implicate questions of\nforeign relations.\u201d INS v. Abudu, 485 U. S. 94, 100 (1988).\nThe Attorney General\u2019s decision to bar an alien who has\nparticipated in persecution \u201cmay affect our relations with\n[the alien\u2019s native] country or its neighbors. The judiciary\nis not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility\nfor assessing the likelihood and importance of such diplo\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmatic repercussions.\u201d Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 425.\n   The Attorney General, in turn, has delegated to the BIA\nthe \u201c \u2018discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney\nGeneral by law\u2019 \u201d in the course of \u201c \u2018considering and deter\nmining cases before it.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 8 CFR \u00a73.1(d)(1)\n(1998)). As a consequence, \u201cthe BIA should be accorded\nChevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms\n\u2018concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adju\ndication.\u2019 \u201d Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 425 (quoting INS v.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 448\u2013449 (1987)). When\nthe BIA has not spoken on \u201ca matter that statutes place\nprimarily in agency hands,\u201d our ordinary rule is to remand\nto \u201cgiv[e] the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in\nthe first instance in light of its own experience.\u201d INS v.\nOrlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16\u201317 (2002) (per curiam).\n                             B\n   The parties disagree over whether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution. As there is substance to both\ncontentions, we conclude that the statute has an ambigu\nity that the agency should address in the first instance.\n   Petitioner argues that the statute\u2019s plain language\nmakes clear that involuntary acts do not implicate the\npersecutor bar because \u201c \u2018persecution\u2019 \u201d presumes moral\nblameworthiness. Brief for Petitioner 23\u201328. He invokes\nprinciples of criminal culpability, concepts of international\nlaw, and the rule of lenity. Id., at 28\u201345. Those argu\nments may be persuasive in determining whether a par\nticular agency interpretation is reasonable, but they do\nnot demonstrate that the statute is unambiguous. Peti\ntioner all but conceded as much at argument in this Court\nwhen he indicated that the BIA has discretion to construe\nthe duress defense in either a narrow or a broad way. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 20\u201324.\n   The Government, on the other hand, asserts that the\n6                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute does not allow petitioner\u2019s construction. \u201cThe\nstatutory text,\u201d the Government says, \u201cdirectly answers\nthat question: there is no exception\u201d for conduct that is\ncoerced because Congress did not include one. Brief for\nRespondent 11. We disagree. The silence is not conclu\nsive. The question is whether the statutory text mandates\nthat coerced actions must be deemed assistance in perse\ncution. On that point the statute, in its precise terms, is\nnot explicit. Nor is this a case where it is clear that Con\ngress had an intention on the precise question at issue.\nCf. Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, at 448\u2013449.\n  The Government, like the BIA and the Court of Appeals,\nrelies on Fedorenko to provide the answer. This reliance is\nnot without some basis, as the Court there held that vol\nuntariness was not required with respect to another per\nsecutor bar. 449 U. S., at 512. To the extent, however, the\nGovernment deems Fedorenko to be controlling, it is in\nerror.\n  In Fedorenko, the Court interpreted the Displaced Per\nsons Act of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009. The DPA was\nenacted \u201cto enable European refugees driven from their\nhomelands by the [second world] war to emigrate to the\nUnited States without regard to traditional immigration\nquotas.\u201d 449 U. S., at 495. Section 2(b) of the DPA pro\nvides relief to \u201cany displaced person or refugee as defined\nin Annex I of the Constitution of the International Refugee\nOrganization\u201d of the United Nations (IRO Constitution).\n62 Stat. 1009. The IRO Constitution, as codified by Con\ngress, excludes any individual \u201cwho can be shown: (a) to\nhave assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations of\ncountries, Members of the United Nations; or (b) to have\nvoluntarily assisted the enemy forces since the outbreak of\nthe second world war in their operations against the\nUnited Nations.\u201d Annex I, Part II, \u00a72, 62 Stat. 3051\u20133052.\n  The Fedorenko Court held that \u201can individual\u2019s service\nas a concentration camp armed guard\u2014whether voluntary\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor involuntary\u2014made him ineligible for a visa\u201d under\n\u00a72(a) of the IRO Constitution. 449 U. S., at 512. That\nCongress did not adopt a voluntariness requirement for\n\u00a72(a), the Court noted, \u201cis plain from comparing \u00a72(a) with\n\u00a72(b), which excludes only those individuals who \u2018voluntar\nily assisted the enemy forces.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The Court relied on\nthe principle of statutory construction that \u201cthe deliberate\nomission of the word \u2018voluntary\u2019 from \u00a72(a) compels the\nconclusion that the statute made all those who assisted in\npersecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\u201d Ibid.\n   Fedorenko does not compel the same conclusion in the\ncase now before us. The textual structure of the statute in\nFedorenko (\u201cvoluntary\u201d is in one subsection but not the\nother) is not part of the statutory framework considered\nhere. Congress did not use the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d in any\nsubsection of the persecutor bar, so its omission cannot\ncarry the same significance.\n   The difference between the statutory scheme in Fe\ndorenko and the one here is confirmed when we \u201c \u2018look not\nonly to the particular statutory language, but to the design\nof the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.\u2019 \u201d\nDada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13)\n(quoting Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407\n(1991)). Both statutes were enacted to reflect principles\nset forth in international agreements, but the principles\ndiffer in significant respects.\n   As discussed, Congress enacted the DPA in 1948 as part\nof an international effort to address individuals who were\nforced to leave their homelands during and after the sec\nond World War. Fedorenko, supra, at 495. The DPA\nexcludes those who \u201cvoluntarily assisted the enemy forces\nsince the outbreak of the second world war,\u201d 62 Stat. 3052,\nas well as all who \u201cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil\npopulations of countries,\u201d id., at 3051. The latter exclu\nsion clause makes no reference to culpability. The exclu\nsion of even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary\n8                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassistance in Nazi persecution, as an expert testified in\nFedorenko, may be \u201c \u2018[b]ecause the crime against humanity\nthat is involved in the concentration camp puts it into a\ndifferent category.\u2019 \u201d 449 U. S., at 511, n. 32.\n  The persecutor bar in this case, by contrast, was enacted\nas part of the Refugee Act of 1980. Unlike the DPA, which\nwas enacted to address not just the post war refugee\nproblem but also the Holocaust and its horror, the Refugee\nAct was designed to provide a general rule for the ongoing\ntreatment of all refugees and displaced persons. As this\nCourt has twice recognized, \u201c \u2018one of Congress\u2019 primary\npurposes\u2019 in passing the Refugee Act was to implement the\nprinciples agreed to in the 1967 United Nations Protocol\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19\nU. S. T. 6224, T. I. A. S. 6577 (1968),\u201d as well as the\n\u201cUnited Nations Convention Relating to the Status of\nRefugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150 (July 28, 1951), reprinted in\n19 U. S.

S., at 436\u2013437).\n  These authorities illustrate why Fedorenko, which\naddressed a different statute enacted for a different pur\npose, does not control the BIA\u2019s interpretation of this\npersecutor bar. Whatever weight or relevance these vari\nous authorities may have in interpreting the statute\nshould be considered by the agency in the first instance,\nand by any subsequent reviewing court, after our remand.\n                             C\n   The Government argues that \u201cif there were any ambigu\nity in the text, the Board\u2019s determination that the bar\ncontains no such exception is reasonable and thus control\nling.\u201d Brief for Respondent 11. Whether such an interpre\ntation would be reasonable, and thus owed Chevron defer\nence, is a legitimate question; but it is not now before us.\nThe BIA deemed its interpretation to be mandated by\nFedorenko, and that error prevented it from a full consid\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neration of the statutory question here presented.\n   In denying relief in this case the BIA recited a rule that\nhas developed in its own case law in reliance on Fe\ndorenko: \u201c[A]n alien\u2019s motivation and intent are irrelevant\nto the issue of whether he \u2018assisted\u2019 in persecution . . . [I]t\nis the objective effect of an alien\u2019s actions which is control\nling.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a. The rule is based on three\nearlier decisions: Matter of Laipenieks, 18 I. & N. Dec. 433\n(1983); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57; and Matter\nof Rodriguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811 (1988).\n   In Matter of Laipenieks, the BIA applied the Court\u2019s\nFedorenko analysis of the DPA to a different postwar\nstatute, which provided for the deportation of anyone\nassociated with the Nazis who \u201cordered, incited, assisted,\nor otherwise participated\u201d in persecution based on a pro\ntected ground. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i). Finding no\nagency or judicial decision on point, the BIA relied on\nFedorenko. It recognized that the unique structure of the\nFedorenko statute was not present in \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i), but\nthe BIA nevertheless adopted wholesale the Fedorenko\nrule: \u201c[A]s in Fedorenko, . . . the plain language of\n[\u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i)] mandates a literal interpretation, and\nthe omission of an intent element compels the conclusion\nthat [\u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i)] makes all those who assisted in the\nspecific persecution deportable.\u201d 18 I. & N. Dec., at 464.\nIn other words, \u201cparticular motivations or intent . . . is not\na relevant factor.\u201d Ibid.\n   The second decision, Matter of Fedorenko, also dealt\nwith \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i), and it involved the same alien\nwhose citizenship was revoked by this Court\u2019s Fedorenko\ndecision. This time the agency sought to deport him.\nFedorenko responded by requesting suspension of deporta\ntion. He argued that, unlike the DPA\u2019s bar on any assis\ntance\u2014voluntary or involuntary\u2014in persecution, see\nFedorenko, 449 U. S., at 512, the text and structure of\n\u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i) required deportation only of those who\n10                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nvoluntarily assisted in persecuting others. The BIA re\njected that distinction, noting that it was foreclosed by\nMatter of Laipenieks: \u201cIt may be, as [Fedorenko] argues,\nthat his service at Treblinka was involuntary. . . . We\nneed not resolve the issue, however, because as a matter of\nlaw [Fedorenko\u2019s] motivations for serving as a guard at\nTreblinka are immaterial to the question of his deportabil\nity under\u201d \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i). 19 I. & N. Dec., at 69\u201370.\n   Later, the BIA applied this Court\u2019s Fedorenko rule to\nthe persecutor bar that is at issue in the present case. In\nMatter of Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA granted relief be\ncause the alien\u2019s coerced conduct as a guerrilla was not\npersecution based on a protected ground. 19 I. & N. Dec.,\nat 815\u2013816. Nevertheless, in reaching its conclusion the\nBIA incorporated without additional analysis the Fe\ndorenko rule as applied in Matter of Laipenieks and reiter\nated in Matter of Fedorenko. 19 I. & N. Dec., at 814\u2013815.\nThe BIA reaffirmed that \u201c[t]he participation or assistance\nof an alien in persecution need not be of his own volition to\nbar him from relief.\u201d Id., at 814 (citing Fedorenko, 449\nU. S. 490).\n   Our reading of these decisions confirms that the BIA\nhas not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead,\nhas determined that Fedorenko controls. This mistaken\nassumption stems from a failure to recognize the inappli\ncability of the principle of statutory construction invoked\nin Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differ\nences in statutory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply\nthe Fedorenko rule that motive and intent are irrelevant\nto the persecutor bar at issue in this case. Whether the\nstatute permits such an interpretation based on a differ\nent course of reasoning must be determined in the first\ninstance by the agency.\n                             III\n     Having concluded that the BIA has not yet exercised its\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

This remand rule exists, in part,\nbecause \u201cambiguities in statutes within an agency\u2019s juris\ndiction to administer are delegations of authority to the\nagency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.\nFilling these gaps . . . involves difficult policy choices that\nagencies are better equipped to make than courts.\u201d Na\ntional Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X\nInternet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980 (2005).\n    JUSTICE STEVENS would have the Court provide a defi\nnite answer to the question presented and then remand\nfor further proceedings. That approach, however, is in\ntension with the \u201cordinary \u2018remand\u2019 rule.\u201d Ventura, supra,\nat 18; see also Cajun Elec. Power Cooperative, Inc. v.\nFERC, 924 F. 2d 1132, 1136 (CADC 1991) (opinion for the\nCourt by Silberman, J., joined by R. Ginsburg and Tho\nmas, JJ.) (\u201c[I]f an agency erroneously contends that Con\ngress\u2019 intent has been clearly expressed and has rested on\nthat ground, we remand to require the agency to consider\nthe question afresh in light of the ambiguity we see\u201d).\nThomas is illustrative. There, the agency had not deter\nmined whether a family may constitute a social group for\nthe purposes of refugee status. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat the family can constitute a protected social group and\nthat the particular family at issue did qualify. 547 U. S.,\nat 184\u2013185. The Solicitor General sought review in this\nCourt on \u201cwhether the Ninth Circuit erred in holding, in\nthe first instance and without prior resolution of the ques\ntions by the relevant administrative agency, that members\nof a family can and do constitute a particular social group,\nwithin the meaning of the Act.\u201d Id., at 185 (internal quo\n12                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntation marks omitted). He argued that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ndecision violated the Ventura ordinary remand rule. We\nagreed and summarily reversed. 547 U. S., at 184\u2013185\n    Ventura and Thomas counsel a similar result here.\nBecause of the important differences between the statute\nbefore us and the one at issue in Fedorenko, we find it\nappropriate to remand to the agency for its initial deter\nmination of the statutory interpretation question and its\napplication to this case. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the\nstatutory meaning of \u201cpersecution\u201d may be explained by a\nmore comprehensive definition, one designed to elaborate\non the term in anticipation of a wide range of potential\nconduct; and that expanded definition in turn may be\ninfluenced by how practical, or impractical, the standard\nwould be in terms of its application to specific cases.\nThese matters may have relevance in determining\nwhether its statutory interpretation is a permissible one.\n    As the Court said in Ventura and reiterated in Thomas,\n\u201c \u2018[t]he agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the\nmatter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial\ndetermination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed\ndiscussion and analysis, help a court later determine\nwhether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law\nprovides.\u2019 \u201d 547 U. S., at 186\u2013187 (quoting Ventura, supra,\nat 17). If the BIA decides to adopt a standard that consid\ners voluntariness to some degree, it may be prudent and\nnecessary for the Immigration Judge to conduct additional\nfactfinding based on the new standard. Those determina\ntions are for the agency to make in the first instance.\n                     *     *    *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, con\ncurring.\n   I agree with the Court that \u201cthe statute has an ambigu\nity,\u201d ante, at 5, with respect to whether an alien who was\ncoerced to assist in persecution is barred from obtaining\nasylum in the United States. I agree that the agency is\nentitled to answer that question. Ibid. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). And I agree that a remand is in\norder, to give the agency an opportunity to clarify whether\nits affirmative answer was premised on an erroneous view\nthat this Court\u2019s decision in Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), compelled it. Ante, at 11.\n   I would not agree to remand if I did not think that the\nagency has the option of adhering to its decision. The\nmajority appears to leave that question undecided, ante, at\n5 (reserving whether \u201ca particular agency interpretation is\nreasonable\u201d); two Justices forthrightly disagree and would\nrequire the agency to recognize at least some sort of du\nress exception, post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part).\n   But good reasons for the agency\u2019s current practice ex\nist\u2014reasons adequate to satisfy the requirement that an\nagency act reasonably in choosing among various possible\nconstructions of an ambiguous statute. The statute does\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nnot mandate the rule precluding the duress defense but\ndoes not foreclose it either; the agency is free to retain\nthat rule so long as the choice to do so is soundly rea\nsoned, not based on irrelevant or arbitrary factors (like\nthe Fedorenko precedent).\n   The primary contention to the contrary is, in short, that\nbarring aliens who persecuted under duress would punish\npurely \u201cnonculpable\u201d conduct. That argument suffers from\nat least three unjustified leaps of logic.\n   First, it implicitly adopts a view of \u201cculpability\u201d that is\nneither the only view nor one necessarily applicable here.\nThe culpability of one who harms another under coercion\nis, and has always been, a subject of intense debate, rais\ning profound questions of moral philosophy and individual\nresponsibility. (The so-called \u201cNuremberg defense\u201d comes\nreadily to mind.) At common law, duress was not an\naccepted defense to intentional killing, see 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law \u00a79.7(b), pp. 74\u201375 (2d ed. 2003);\nand in modern times, some states do not allow it as a\ndefense to lesser crimes, see id., at 81\u201382, and n. 50.\nNotably, there is no historical support for the duress\ndefense when a soldier follows a military order he knows\nto be unlawful. Id., \u00a79.7(g), at 86; see also, e.g., Axtell\u2019s\nCase, Kel. J. 13, 84 Eng. Rep. 1060 (1660); Prosecutor v.\nErdemovi\u0107, [1997] 2 ICTY Jud. Rep. 1610, 1635 (Int\u2019l\nCrim. Trib. for Former Yugoslavia). It is therefore far\nfrom clear that precluding a duress defense here would, as\npetitioner alleges, \u201cdisregard principles of blame . . . \u2018uni\nversal and persistent\u2019 in American law.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 32 (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S.\n246, 250 (1952)). All of this suggests that those who are\ncoerced to commit wrong are at least sometimes \u201cculpable\u201d\nenough to be treated as criminals.\n   More importantly, this is not a criminal matter. This\nCourt has long understood that an \u201corder of deportation is\nnot a punishment for crime.\u201d Fong Yue Ting v. United\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nStates, 149 U. S. 698, 730 (1893). Asylum is a benefit\naccorded by grace, not by entitlement, and withholding\nthat benefit from all who have intentionally harmed oth\ners\u2014whether under coercion or not\u2014is not unreasonable.\n   Second, petitioner assumes that the persecutor bar must\nhave been intended merely to punish wrongdoing. But in\nthe context of immigration law, \u201cculpability\u201d as a relevant\nfactor in determining admissibility is only one facet of a\nmore general consideration: desirability. And there may\nwell be reasons to think that those who persecuted others,\neven under duress, would be relatively undesirable as\nimmigrants. If, for example, the asylum laws grant entry\nto those who suffered the persecution, might it not be\nimprudent to also grant entry to the coerced persecutor,\nwho may end up living in the same community as one of\nhis victims? The Nation has a legitimate interest in pre\nventing the importation of ethnic strife from remote parts\nof the world, and the agency may resolve the statutory\nambiguity in a way that safeguards that interest.\n   Finally, even if culpability is the only relevant factor,\nand even if a narrow, criminal-law based view of culpabil\nity is the authoritative one, a bright-line rule excluding all\npersecutors\u2014whether acting under coercion or not\u2014might\nstill be the best way for the agency to effectuate the statu\ntory scheme. See generally Cox & Posner, Second-Order\nStructure of Immigration Law, 59 Stan. L. Rev. 809\n(2007). Immigration judges already face the overwhelm\ning task of attempting to recreate, by a limited number of\nwitnesses speaking through (often poor-quality) transla\ntion, events that took place years ago in foreign, usually\nimpoverished countries. See Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F. 3d\n228, 261\u2013262 (CA3 2003) (en banc) (Alito, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). Adding on top of that the\nburden of adjudicating claims of duress and coercion,\nwhich are extremely difficult to corroborate and necessar\nily pose questions of degree that require intensely fact\n4                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nbound line-drawing, would increase the already inherently\nhigh risk of error. And the cost of error (viz., allowing\nuncoerced persecutors to remain in the country perma\nnently) might reasonably be viewed by the agency as\nsignificantly greater than the cost of overinclusion under a\nbright-line rule (viz., denial of asylum to some coerced\npersecutors\u2014who might anyway be entitled to protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture, which includes no\nanalogous persecutor bar).\n   It is worth noting that although the agency\u2019s \u201cobjective\neffects\u201d approach to the statute would seem to sweep\nbeyond the duress scenario to encompass even an alien\nwho had no idea that his actions would \u201cobjectively\u201d assist\nin persecution, see Casta\u00f1eda-Castillo v. Gonzales, 488\nF. 3d 17, 20 (CA1 2007) (en banc), there is no reason why\nthe agency cannot consider questions of knowledge sepa\nrate and apart from questions of duress. Both can be said\nto relate to the mental state of the persecutor,* but they\npresent different problems which can be grappled with\nseparately.     The agency need not provide an \u201call\nembracing answer,\u201d ibid., in the present case. It may\nevaluate problems one by one as they arise, and whatever\nit might decide about an unknowing persecutor is irrele\nvant to petitioner, who knew exactly what he was doing.\n   To be clear, I do not endorse any particular rule. It is to\nagency officials, not to the Members of this Court, that\nCongress has given discretion to choose among permissible\ninterpretations of the statute. They deserve to be told\nclearly whether we are serious about allowing them to\nexercise that discretion, or are rather firing a warning\nshot across the bow.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The rationale for the duress defense, however, is conventionally \u201cnot\nthat the defendant . . . somehow loses his mental capacity to commit\nthe crime in question,\u201d but rather that \u201ceven though he has done the\nact the crime requires and has the mental state which the crime re\nquires, his conduct . . . is excused.\u201d 2 LaFave, supra, \u00a79.7(a), at 73.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

In the years before Chev\u00ad\nron, this Court recognized that statutory interpretation is\na multifaceted enterprise, ranging from a precise construc\u00ad\ntion of statutory language to a determination of what\npolicy best effectuates statutory objectives. We accord\u00ad\ningly acknowledged that a complete interpretation of a\nstatutory provision might demand both judicial construc\u00ad\ntion and administrative explication. E.g., NLRB v. Hearst\nPublications, Inc., 322 U. S. 111 (1944) (construing the\nterm \u201cemployee\u201d in the National Labor Relations Act but\ndeferring to the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s finding\nthat newsboys were employees); see Nathanson, Adminis\u00ad\ntrative Discretion in the Interpretation of Statutes, 3\nVand. L. Rev. 470 (1950).\n   Chevron adhered to this approach. There, we recognized\nthat the Clean Air Act did not define \u201cstationary source,\u201d\n42 U. S. C. \u00a77502(b)(6) (1982 ed.), but rather implicitly\ndelegated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nthe policy question whether States could treat entire\nplants or only their discrete pollution-emitting devices as\nsources of pollution for purposes of the Act\u2019s permit pro\u00ad\ngram. Congress left a gap for the agency to fill, and the\nagency brought its expertise, political acuity, and informa\u00ad\ntion-gathering abilities to bear in doing so. See Chevron,\n467 U. S., at 865\u2013866.1 In keeping with precedent, see id.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Notably,\n             the EPA cast its activity not as statutory construction but\nas public administration; its rulemaking sought to achieve policy goals,\nsuch as reducing regulatory complexity and promoting plant moderni\u00ad\nzation. See 46 Fed. Reg. 50766 (1981). To be sure, the EPA argued\nthat its regulation defining \u201cstationary source\u201d as an entire plant was\npermissible under the Clean Air Act, but the agency treated its rule\u00ad\nmaking as a matter of fashioning sound policy, not of discerning the\nmeaning of \u201cstationary source\u201d in the statute.\n                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                3\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nat 843\u2013845, and nn. 9, 11\u201314, our opinion reaffirmed both\nthat \u201c[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of\nstatutory construction,\u201d id., at 843, n. 9, and that courts\nshould defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable formulation of\npolicy in response to an explicit or implicit congressional\ndelegation of authority. The Chevron framework thus\naccounts for the different institutional competencies of\nagencies and courts: Courts are expert at statutory con\u00ad\nstruction, while agencies are expert at statutory imple\u00ad\nmentation. That the distinction can be subtle does not\nlessen its importance.\n   In the 25 years since Chevron was decided, this Court\nhas continued to recognize that courts and agencies play\ncomplementary roles in the project of statutory interpreta\u00ad\ntion. We have repeatedly held that \u201cambiguities in stat\u00ad\nutes within an agency\u2019s jurisdiction to administer are\ndelegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory\ngap in reasonable fashion.\u201d National Cable & Telecom\u00ad\nmunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S.\n967, 980 (2005). But even when confronted with a statute\nthat involves a degree of ambiguity\u2014as most statutes do\u2014\nwe have not abdicated our judicial role. The fact that\nCongress has left a gap for the agency to fill means that\ncourts should defer to the agency\u2019s reasonable gap-filling\ndecisions, not that courts should cease to mark the bounds\nof delegated agency choice.2\n   In cases involving agency adjudication, we have some\u00ad\ntimes described the court\u2019s role as deciding pure questions\nof statutory construction and the agency\u2019s role as applying\nlaw to fact. See, e.g., Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421;\nNLRB v. Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U. S. 112\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Cf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 236\u2013238 (2001);\n\nBarnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 222 (2002) (noting that Mead\n\u201cindicated that whether a court should give [Chevron] deference de\u00ad\npends in significant part upon the interpretive method used and the\nnature of the question at issue\u201d).\n4                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\n(1987); see also Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U. S.\n677, 701\u2013702 (2004). While this phrasing is peculiar to\nthe adjudicatory context, the principle applies to Chevron\u2019s\ndomain more broadly. In the context of agency rulemak\u00ad\ning, for instance, we might distinguish between pure\nquestions of statutory interpretation and policymaking, or\nbetween central legal issues and interstitial questions.\nSee Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 222 (2002).3 The\nlabel is immaterial. What matters is the principle: Cer\u00ad\ntain aspects of statutory interpretation remain within the\npurview of the courts, even when the statute is not en\u00ad\ntirely clear, while others are properly understood as dele\u00ad\ngated by Congress to an expert and accountable adminis\u00ad\ntrative body. Statutory language may thus admit of both\njudicial construction and agency exposition.\n                             II\n   Two of this Court\u2019s cases construing the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 166, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101\net seq., illustrate the proper division of responsibility\nbetween courts and agencies and highlight when Chevron\ndeference is appropriate and when it is not. In Cardoza-\nFonseca, the question was whether the standard of INA\n\u00a7243(h), 8 U. S. C. \u00a71253(h) (1982 ed.), which requires an\nalien to show that she is more likely than not to be subject\nto persecution if she is deported, also governs applications\nfor asylum under \u00a7208(a), 8 U. S. C. \u00a71158(a) (1982 ed.),\nwhich authorizes the Attorney General to grant asylum to\nan alien who has a well-founded fear of persecution in her\nhome country. After considering the INA\u2019s language, its\nlegislative history, and the United Nations Protocol that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Administrative Procedure Act draws a similar distinction in\n\nproviding that courts \u201cshall decide all relevant questions of law [and]\ninterpret constitutional and statutory provisions\u201d but shall review\n\u201cagency action, findings, and conclusions\u201d under the arbitrary and\ncapricious/abuse of discretion standard. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nCongress had implemented, the Court determined that the\ntwo standards are not the same.\n   In so holding, we decisively rejected the Government\u2019s\ncontention, echoed by JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence in the\njudgment, that the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA)\ninterpretation of the statute merited deference under our\nthen-recent decision in Chevron. \u201cThe question whether\nCongress intended the two standards to be identical is a\npure question of statutory construction for the courts to\ndecide,\u201d we stated. 480 U. S., at 446. We therefore did not\ndefer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the two standards as\nequivalent but instead employed traditional tools of statu\u00ad\ntory construction and \u201cconcluded that Congress did not\nintend the two standards to be identical.\u201d Ibid.4\n   Importantly, we recognized that Chevron deference need\nnot be an all-or-nothing venture. Even after the question\nof the standards\u2019 equivalency was resolved, there re\u00ad\nmained the question of their application. We explained,\n\u201cThe narrow legal question whether the two standards are\nthe same is, of course, quite different from the question of\ninterpretation that arises in each case in which the agency\nis required to apply either or both standards to a particu\u00ad\nlar set of facts.\u201d 480 U. S., at 448. And we noted that\napplying the INA was a task particularly suited to the\nagency\u2019s unique competencies: \u201cThere is obviously some\nambiguity in a term like \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 which can only\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 JUSTICE SCALIA objected in particular to the majority\u2019s holding that\n\npure questions of statutory construction are for the courts, not agencies,\nto decide; he insisted this was unfaithful to Chevron, \u201csince in Chevron\nthe Court deferred to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s abstract\ninterpretation of the phrase \u2018stationary source.\u2019 \u201d 480 U. S., at 455\n(opinion concurring in judgment). The majority rejected JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s argument, recognizing that Chevron involved an agency\u2019s\ncomplex policy judgment about how to fill a statutory gap, not a pure\nquestion of statutory construction. See 480 U. S., at 445\u2013448, and n. 29\n(quoting extensively from Chevron).\n6                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nbe given concrete meaning through a process of case-by\u00ad\ncase adjudication. In that process of filling \u2018 \u201cany gap left,\nimplicitly or explicitly by Congress,\u201d \u2019 the courts must\nrespect the interpretation of the agency to which Congress\nhas delegated the responsibility for administering the\nstatutory program.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at\n843, in turn quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199, 231\n(1974)).\n  In INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415 (1999), the\nCourt encountered just the type of agency decision Car\u00ad\ndoza-Fonseca indicated would warrant Chevron deference.\nThe BIA had denied withholding of deportation because it\nfound that the respondent had \u201ccommitted a serious non\u00ad\npolitical crime\u201d before he entered the United States, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71253(h)(2)(C) (1994 ed.). The Court of Appeals\nreversed the agency\u2019s decision and required it to supple\u00ad\nment its balancing test with specific additional factors\n(such as whether the respondent\u2019s acts were grossly out of\nproportion to their objective and whether the acts were\npolitically necessary and successful).\n  We reversed the Court of Appeals, concluding that\nChevron deference should be accorded to the BIA \u201cas it\ngives ambiguous statutory terms \u2018concrete meaning\nthrough a process of case-by-case adjudication.\u2019 \u201d 526 U. S.,\nat 425 (quoting Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 448). The\nBIA\u2019s formulation of a test to apply the statutory standard\nin individual cases and its application of that test in re\u00ad\nspondent\u2019s case were precisely the sort of agency actions\nthat merited judicial deference.\n                           III\n  The threshold question the Court addresses today is the\nkind of \u201cpure question of statutory construction for the\ncourts to decide\u201d that we answered in Cardoza-Fonseca,\nid., at 446, rather than a fact-intensive question of the\nkind we addressed in Aguirre-Aguirre. Just as we decided\n                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     7\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthe narrow legal question presented in Cardoza-Fonseca\nbut did not \u201cattempt to set forth a detailed description of\nhow the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 test should be applied,\u201d 480\nU. S., at 448, I would decide the narrow legal question now\nbefore us and remand for the agency to determine how the\npersecutor bar applies in individual cases.5\n  For reasons similar to those set forth in my dissent in\nFedorenko, I think it plain that the persecutor bar does\nnot disqualify from asylum or withholding of removal an\nalien whose conduct was coerced or otherwise the product\nof duress. Although I agree in full with the Court\u2019s con\u00ad\nclusion that the majority opinion in Fedorenko does not\ngovern our interpretation of the persecutor bar, the differ\u00ad\nences the Court highlights between the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009, and the Refugee Act of\n1980, 94 Stat. 102, only strengthen my conclusion that\nvoluntary assistance in persecution is required and that\nduress and coercion vitiate voluntariness.\n  The Fedorenko Court\u2019s construction of the DPA threat\u00ad\nened to exclude from the United States concentration\ncamp prisoners who were forced to assist the Nazis in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 The majority suggests that this approach is inconsistent with the\n\n\u201c \u2018ordinary \u201cremand\u201d rule\u2019 \u201d articulated in Gonzales v. Thomas, 547 U. S.\n183 (2006) (per curiam), and INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12\n(2002) (per curiam). Ante, at 11\u201312. But those cases involved exactly\nthe sort of application of law to fact that is within the agency\u2019s purview.\nIn Thomas, the Court of Appeals decided that the family at issue \u201cfell\nwithin the scope of the statutory term \u2018particular social group.\u2019 \u201d 547\nU. S., at 185. We noted that the BIA had not considered this question,\nwhich \u201crequire[d] determining the facts and deciding whether the facts\nas found f[e]ll within a statutory term.\u201d Id., at 186. Accordingly, we\nheld that the court should have remanded to the agency. Similarly, in\nVentura, the Court of Appeals addressed an issue that the BIA had not\nreached and concluded that conditions in Guatemala had so improved\nthat no realistic threat of persecution currently existed. The Govern\u00ad\nment argued that the court had not respected \u201cthe BIA\u2019s role as fact\u00ad\nfinder,\u201d 537 U. S., at 16, and we agreed, reversing the court\u2019s judgment\ninsofar as it had not remanded to the agency.\n8                      NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\npersecution of other prisoners. In my view, this construc\u00ad\ntion was insupportable\u2014the DPA\u2019s exclusion of persons\nwho \u201cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations,\u201d\nConstitution of the International Refugee Organization,\nAnnex I, Part II, \u00a72(a), 62 Stat. 3051, did not extend to\nconcentration camp prisoners who did so involuntarily.\nThese prisoners were victims, not persecutors.\n   Without an exception for involuntary action, the Refu\u00ad\ngee Act\u2019s bar would similarly treat entire classes of victims\nas persecutors. The Act does not support such a reading.\nThe language of the persecutor bar is most naturally read\nto denote culpable conduct, and this reading is powerfully\nsupported by the statutory context and legislative history.\n   As this Court has previously recognized\u2014and as the\nmajority acknowledges again today\u2014Congress passed the\nRefugee Act to implement the United Nations Convention\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150\n(July 28, 1951) (hereinafter Convention), reprinted in 19\nU. S. T. 6259, and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relat\u00ad\ning to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, [1968] 19\nU. S. T. 6223, T. I. A. S. No. 6577 (hereinafter Protocol).\nThese treaties place a mandatory obligation on signatory\nstates not to \u201cexpel or return (\u2018refouler\u2019) a refugee in any\nmanner whatsoever to . . . territories where his life or\nfreedom would be threatened on account of his race, relig\u00ad\nion, nationality, membership of a particular social group\nor political opinion.\u201d Convention, Art. 33(1), 19 U. S. T., at\n6276; Protocol, Art. I, 19 U. S. T., at 6225. The Refugee\nAct\u2019s withholding of removal provision specifically tracks\nthis language. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(b)(3)(A); see H. R.

S. T., at 6263. It is this\nexception that the persecutor bar reflects. See, e.g., H. R.\nRep. No. 96\u2013608, at 18 (persecutor bar encompasses \u201cex\u00ad\nceptions . . . provided in the Convention relating to aliens\nwho have themselves participated in persecution\u201d); H. R.\nConf. Rep. No. 96\u2013781, p. 20 (1980). The language of the\nConvention\u2019s exception is critical: We do not normally\nconvict individuals of crimes when their actions are co\u00ad\nerced or otherwise involuntary. Indeed, the United Na\u00ad\ntions Handbook, to which the Court has looked for guid\u00ad\nance in the past, states that all relevant factors, including\n\u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d must be considered in deter\u00ad\nmining whether an alien\u2019s acts are of a \u201ccriminal nature\u201d\nas contemplated by Article 1(F). Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on\nProcedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\n\u00b6\u00b6157, 162 (reedited Jan. 1992). Other states parties to\nthe Convention and Protocol likewise read the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s exception as limited to culpable conduct.7 When we\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and its\nimplementing regulations.

The\nCAT prohibits a state party from returning any person to a country\nwhere there is substantial reason to believe he might be tortured, but\nits definition of torture covers a narrower class of harms, imposed by a\nnarrower class of actors, than the asylum and witholding of removal\nprovisions. Most importantly, the CAT limits its definition of torture to\nacts \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquies\u00ad\ncence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity,\u201d\nPt.

See Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co.,\n516 U. S. 217, 226\u2013228 (1996). Congress\u2019 effort to conform\nUnited States law to the standard set forth in the U. N.\nConvention and Protocol shows that it intended the perse\u00ad\ncutor bar to apply only to culpable, voluntary acts\u2014and it\nunderscores that Congress did not delegate the question\npresented by this case to the agency.\n   While I would hold that the persecutor bar does not\nautomatically disqualify from asylum or withholding of\nremoval an alien who acted involuntarily,8 I would leave\nfor the Attorney General\u2014and, through his own delega\u00ad\ntion, the BIA\u2014the question how the voluntariness stan\u00ad\ndard should be applied. The agency would retain the\nability, for instance, to define duress and coercion; to\ndetermine whether or not a balancing test should be em\u00ad\nployed; and, of course, to decide whether any individual\nasylum-seeker\u2019s acts were covered by the persecutor bar.\nThose are the sorts of questions suited to the agency\u2019s\nunique competencies in administering the INA.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\n   The \u201cpersecutor bar\u201d in the Immigration and National\u00ad\nity Act (INA) denies asylum and the withholding of re\u00ad\nmoval to any alien who has \u201cordered, incited, assisted, or\notherwise participated in the persecution of any person on\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The Board\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA), principally relying on this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S.\n490 (1981), held that the statute does not require that the\npersecution be voluntarily inflicted. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n   According to the Court, Fedorenko, which construed the\nsimilar text of a persecution bar in the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), is largely irrelevant to the question\npresented here. See ante, at 6\u20138, 9\u201310; see also ante, at 2\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). The majority further holds that\nthe INA is ambiguous as to \u201cwhether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution\u201d and that the agency, there\u00ad\nfore, should interpret the statute in the first instance to\ndetermine whether it reasonably can be read to include a\nvoluntariness requirement. Ante, at 5, 10\u201312; see also\nante, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concurring). I disagree with both of\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthese conclusions. Because the INA unambiguously pre\u00ad\ncludes any inquiry into whether the persecutor acted\nvoluntarily, i.e., free from coercion or duress, I would\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Daniel Girmai Negusie testified to the Immi\u00ad\ngration Judge (IJ) that he was forced to work as an armed\nguard for four years at an Eritrean prison camp where\nprisoners were persecuted because of their religious be\u00ad\nliefs. According to petitioner, part of his job was \u201cto firmly\ncontrol the prisoners, to punish the prisoners, too, by\nexposing them\u201d to the extreme heat of the African sun.\nApp. 58. The guards \u201cwould . . . hold [a] stick [with] their\nhand\u201d and follow prisoners who were being forced to \u201croll\non the ground in the sun.\u201d Id., at 23. Because \u201cit was\nextremely hot,\u201d prisoners would quickly \u201cget tired and\n[feel] shortness of breath and stop\u201d rolling. Id., at 24.\nThey were then beaten. Prisoners typically could not\nsurvive this punishment for more than two hours. Indeed,\nat least one prisoner died from sun exposure while peti\u00ad\ntioner stood guard. See ante, at 3 (majority opinion).\n   Petitioner testified that, as a guard, he prevented the\nprisoners from showering and forbade them from leaving\ntheir rooms for fresh air. This form of punishment was\nparticularly severe because the prisons were \u201cbuilt from\nstone and bricks\u201d with \u201cno cooling system, no ventilation,\nno windows,\u201d and intolerable heat. App. 20, 30. Petitioner\nalso prevented prisoner escapes, for which the punishment\nwas forced sun exposure. And, although petitioner never\nused \u201celectricity to torture\u201d prisoners, he was aware that\nhis supervisor did. Id., at 61\u201362.\n   But petitioner, who had converted to Protestantism\nwhen he was confined as a prisoner at the camp, also\ntestified that he did not want to persecute any of the\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprisoners because his new religion taught him \u201cto be\nmerciful.\u201d Id., at 34. Thus, at times he disobeyed his\norders. On one occasion, he gave water to a prisoner who\nwas dying from sun exposure. On another occasion, he let\nfemale prisoners take showers after they had been denied\nthat privilege \u201cfor a long time.\u201d Id., at 37. Petitioner also\noccasionally allowed some of the prisoners to \u201cgo outside\nduring the night and during the evenings and . . . refresh\nthemselves in the fresh air.\u201d Id., at 37\u201338.\n   After four years as a prison guard, petitioner deserted\nhis post, swam to a shipping container, and hid inside.\nSee ante, at 3 (majority opinion). The container arrived in\nthe United States with petitioner inside on December 20,\n2004. Petitioner applied for asylum and the withholding\nof removal under the INA, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101 et seq. He also\napplied for protection under the Convention Against Tor\u00ad\nture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment\nor Punishment (CAT), under which it is \u201cthe policy of the\nUnited States not to expel, extradite, or otherwise effect\nthe involuntary return of any person to a country in which\nthere are substantial grounds for believing the person\nwould be in danger of being subjected to torture.\u201d Foreign\nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, \u00a72242(a),\n112 Stat. 2681\u2013822, note following 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231, p. 263\n(United States Policy with Respect to Involuntary Return\nof Persons in Danger of Subjection to Torture (hereinafter\nCAT Policy)). See also CAT, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc.\nNo. 100\u201320, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85. Petitioner feared that, if\nreturned to Eritrea, he would \u201cbe executed\u201d because he\nhad converted to Protestantism and deserted his military\npost. App. 65, 68.\n   The INA provides the Executive with the discretion to\ngrant asylum to aliens that are \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to\nreturn to their home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, relig\u00ad\nion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,\n4                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nor political opinion.\u201d           8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42)(A),\n1158(b)(1). The INA also requires the Executive to with\u00ad\nhold removal of aliens to a country in which there is a\n\u201cclear probability\u201d that their \u201clife or freedom would be\nthreatened\u201d because of their \u201crace, religion, nationality,\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opin\u00ad\nion.\u201d \u00a71231(b)(3)(A). However, the INA prohibits the\nExecutive from granting asylum or withholding removal if\nan alien \u201cordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise partici\u00ad\npated in the persecution\u201d of any person on account of\n\u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.\u201d \u00a71158(b)(2)(A)(i) (asy\u00ad\nlum); \u00a71231(b)(3)(B) (withholding of removal). Nonethe\u00ad\nless, in light of the CAT\u2019s requirement that \u201c[n]o State\nParty shall . . . return . . . a person to another State where\nthere are substantial grounds for believing that he would\nbe in danger of being subjected to torture,\u201d Art. 3, S.\nTreaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, at 20, regulations implementing\nthat convention provide \u201cdeferral of removal\u201d to aliens\nsubject to the INA persecutor bar who would more likely\nthan not be tortured if removed to their home country.1 8\nCFR \u00a7\u00a71208.16(c)(4), (d)(2), 1208.17(a) (2008); see also\nCAT Policy (b), at 263 (requiring federal agencies to \u201cpre\u00ad\nscribe regulations to implement the obligations of the\nUnited States under Article 3 of the [CAT], subject to any\nreservations, understandings, declarations, and provisos\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 \u201cDeferralof removal\u201d was created to accommodate Congress\u2019 direc\u00ad\ntion to exclude those who fall within the INA persecutor bar \u201c[t]o the\nmaximum extent consistent with the obligations of the United States\nunder the [CAT]\u201d to not return an alien to a country in which he or she\nwill be tortured. CAT Policy (c), at 263. To accomplish that goal,\ndeferral of removal provides \u201ca less permanent form of protection than\nwithholding of removal and one that is more easily and quickly termi\u00ad\nnated if it becomes possible to remove the alien consistent with Article\n3\u201d of the CAT, 64 Fed. Reg. 8480 (1999), while also \u201censur[ing] that\n[such aliens] are not returned to a country where they would be tor\u00ad\ntured,\u201d id.\u00b8 at 8481.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

The BIA affirmed. In their view, petitioner\u2019s\nconduct objectively qualified as assistance or participation\nin the persecution of others based on religion. See ante, at\n3 (majority opinion). Relying on Fedorenko, the IJ and\nBIA found that even if petitioner was \u201ccompelled to par\u00ad\nticipate as a prison guard\u201d against his wishes, his \u201cmotiva\u00ad\ntion and intent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he\n\u2018assisted\u2019 in persecution.\u201d Ibid. (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Therefore, petitioner was ineligible for\nasylum or the withholding of removal under the INA. The\nIJ and BIA agreed, however, that petitioner qualified for\ndeferral of removal because it is \u201cmore likely than not that\nhe would be tortured\u201d if returned to Eritrea given that its\n\u201cgovernment has used deadly force and threatened to use\ndeadly force against deserters.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a\u2013\n8a, 20a, 19a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. See Negusie\nv. Gonzales, 231 Fed. Appx. 325, 326 (CA5 2007) (per\ncuriam).\n                              II\n   As with all statutory interpretation questions, construc\u00ad\ntion of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar must begin with the plain\nlanguage of the statute. See Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5) (citing Lamie v. United\nStates Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004)). If the text of a\nstatute governing agency action \u201c \u2018directly addresse[s] the\nprecise question at issue,\u2019 \u201d then, \u201c \u2018that is the end of the\nmatter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give\neffect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Con\u00ad\ngress.\u2019 \u201d National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 551 U. S. 664, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 18) (quoting\n6                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842\u2013843 (1984)).\n                               A\n  A court must first \u201clook to the particular statutory\nlanguage at issue.\u201d K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S.\n281, 291 (1988). As the majority acknowledges, see ante,\nat 5\u20136, the text of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar neither in\u00ad\ncludes the term \u201cvoluntary\u201d nor contains an exception for\ninvoluntary, coerced conduct. The statute instead applies\nto any alien \u201cwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\nparticipated in the persecution of any person\u201d on account\nof a protected ground. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i),\n1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n  The statute\u2019s key terms also do not imply any voluntari\u00ad\nness requirement for persecution. Under the ordinary\nmeaning of the term \u201cpersecution\u201d at the time of the stat\u00ad\nute\u2019s enactment in 1980 and its reenactment in 1996, the\nact of persecution alone is sufficient to classify one\u2019s con\u00ad\nduct as persecution. See Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate\nDictionary 877 (1991) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s Ninth) (defin\u00ad\ning \u201cpersecution\u201d as \u201cthe act or practice of persecuting esp.\nthose who differ in origin, religion, or social outlook\u201d); see\nalso Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 855 (1975) (here\u00ad\ninafter Webster\u2019s) (same). The term itself includes no\nintrinsic mens rea requirement. As a result, an individual\ncan \u201cpersecute\u201d\u2014meaning \u201charass in a manner designed\nto injure, grieve, or afflict\u201d\u2014without having designed the\nact or intended for injury, grief, or affliction to occur.\nWebster\u2019s Ninth 877; see also Webster\u2019s 855 (same).\n  The persecutor bar\u2019s inclusion of those who \u201cassist\u201d or\n\u201cparticipate\u201d confirms that it does not include a voluntari\u00ad\nness requirement. The term \u201cassist\u201d is defined as \u201cto give\nsupport or aid,\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth 109, or \u201cto help,\u201d Oxford\nAmerican Dictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford). See\nalso Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 111 (5th ed. 1979) (hereinaf\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              7\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nter Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cassist\u201d as \u201c[t]o help; aid; succor; lend\ncountenance or encouragement to; participate in as an\nauxiliary\u201d). And \u201cparticipate\u201d means simply \u201cto take part,\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Ninth 858, or \u201cto have a share, to take part in\nsomething,\u201d Oxford 487; see also Black\u2019s 1007 (defining\n\u201cparticipate\u201d as \u201c[t]o receive or have a part or share of; to\npartake of; experience in common with others; to have or\nenjoy a part or share in common with others\u201d). Accord\u00ad\ningly, this Court has concluded that the ordinary mean\u00ad\nings of \u201cassist\u201d and \u201cparticipate\u201d do not \u201cconnote volun\u00ad\ntariness.\u201d Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524\nU. S. 206, 211 (1998) (participate); see also Fedorenko, 449\nU. S., at 512 (assist). These are \u201cterms and concepts of\nbreadth,\u201d Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 21\u201322\n(1983), that require only that an individual take \u201csome\npart in\u201d an activity, or help it to occur in some way. Reves\nv. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170, 178\u2013179 (1993) (empha\u00ad\nsis in original). Even if participation or assistance is\ncoerced, it remains participation or assistance just the\nsame.\n                             B\n  In addition to the particular statutory section of the INA\nbefore the Court, \u201cthe language and design of the statute\nas a whole\u201d is instructive in determining the provision\u2019s\nplain meaning. K mart Corp., supra, at 291; see also\nAmoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480 U. S. 531, 552\u2013553\n(1987). Here, the INA\u2019s design and structure buttress the\nconclusion that the persecutor bar applies irrespective of\nvoluntariness.\n  First, Congress has evidenced its ability to both specifi\u00ad\ncally require voluntary conduct and explicitly exclude\ninvoluntary conduct in other provisions of the INA. See\ninfra, at 15\u201316. For example, Congress has barred admis\u00ad\nsion to the United States of totalitarian party members\nunless their membership was \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n8                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a71182(a)(3)(D)(ii), and it has provided for the termination\nof asylum when an alien \u201chas voluntarily availed himself\nor herself\u201d of another country\u2019s protections, \u00a71158(c)(2)(D).\n\u201c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\nexclusion.\u201d Russello, supra, at 23 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see, e.g., Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,\n534 U. S. 438, 452\u2013454 (2002). The absence of a volun\u00ad\ntariness requirement in the INA persecutor bar is no\nexception.\n   Second, federal immigration law provides calibrated\nremedies, which include partial refuge for specified aliens\nwho have both suffered from and inflicted persecution.\nThose who have been persecuted and have not engaged in\npersecution may receive both asylum and the withholding\nof removal. \u00a7\u00a71231(b)(3)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A). Those at the\nother end of the spectrum, who have not been persecuted\nbut have persecuted others, may not receive either asylum\nor the withholding of removal. \u00a7\u00a71231(b)(3)(B)(i),\n1158(b)(2)(A)(i). And finally, for many individuals who\n(like petitioner) have both persecuted others and been\npersecuted, the scheme provides temporary refuge; they\nwill receive deferral of removal under the CAT if they will\nface torture upon their return to their home country. CAT\nPolicy (a), at 263; see also 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a71208.13(a),\n1208.16(d)(2).\n   Where \u201cCongress has enacted a comprehensive scheme\nand has deliberately targeted specific problems with spe\u00ad\ncific solutions,\u201d courts should not read one part of the\nlegislative regime (the INA) to provide a different, and\nconflicting, solution to a problem that has already been\nspecifically addressed elsewhere in the federal immigra\u00ad\ntion regime (regulations implementing the CAT). Varity\nCorp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 519 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Federal law provides\nonly partial protection to a victim of persecution who has\nalso engaged in persecution, voluntarily or not. There\nsimply is no justification for writing into the INA\u2019s perse\u00ad\ncutor bar the greater protections of asylum and the with\u00ad\nholding of removal for individuals who were coerced into\nengaging in persecution. That is, the \u201cassumption of\ninadvertent omission\u201d of a voluntariness requirement in\nthe INA \u201cis rendered especially suspect upon close consid\u00ad\neration of [a statute\u2019s] interlocking, interrelated, and\ninterdependent remedial scheme\u201d that addresses the\nspecific problem at issue in a conflicting way.

In fact, \u201cover no conceivable subject is the legislative power of\nCongress more complete than it is over\u201d the decision of Congress to\nadmit or to exclude aliens. Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Stranahan, 214\nU. S. 320, 339 (1909). Courts therefore must enforce the immigration\npolicy decision reflected in a statute\u2019s plain terms, even if Congress has\nchosen \u201cto forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions\u201d\naltogether, Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U. S. 698, 705 (1893).\nLikewise, here, where Congress has made a judgment about which\npersons to admit and exclude from the country, it is not for this Court\nto question the wisdom of that choice.\n10                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ned. 2008). Here, the statutory and decisional backdrop\nagainst which Congress enacted the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\ncounsels against grafting a voluntariness requirement\nonto the statute.\n   When Congress enacted the INA\u2019s persecutor bar, it\nessentially retained the language used in similar prede\u00ad\ncessor statutes. Under the 1948 DPA persecutor bar,\nentry was denied to all who \u201c \u2018assisted the enemy in perse\u00ad\ncuting civil[ians].\u2019 \u201d Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at 495 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3051). In 1950, Congress added a second persecu\u00ad\ntor bar to the DPA that applied \u201cto any person who advo\u00ad\ncated or assisted in the persecution of any person because\nof race, religion, or national origin.\u201d \u00a713, 64 Stat. 227. In\nthe years that followed, Congress continued to use this\nsame broad language in denying asylum to specific catego\u00ad\nries of persecutors. See, e.g., \u00a7105, 91 Stat. 1224 (denying\npermanent residence to aliens from Vietnam, Laos, and\nCambodia \u201cwho ordered, assisted, or otherwise partici\u00ad\npated in the persecution of any person because of race,\nreligion, or political opinion\u201d); 8 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71182(a)(3)(E),\n1227(a)(4)(D)) (authorizing the exclusion of anyone who\nhad been associated with Nazi forces and had \u201cordered,\nincited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecu\u00ad\ntion of any person because of race, religion, national ori\u00ad\ngin, or political opinion\u201d); \u00a714(a), 67 Stat. 406 (imposing\npersecutor bar on \u201cany person who personally advocated or\nassisted in the persecution of . . . [a] group of persons\nbecause of race, religion, or national origin\u201d).\n   Congress then enacted the INA bar in 1980. This stat\u00ad\nute comprehensively labeled as a persecutor \u201cany person\nwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in\nthe persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or\npolitical opinion.\u201d \u00a7201(a), 94 Stat. 102\u2013103.

By the time of the 1996 reen\u00ad\nactment, this Court had specifically interpreted the plain\nlanguage of the predecessor bars to apply regardless of the\nvoluntariness of a persecutor\u2019s conduct.

In particular, this\nCourt had held that the phrase in the 1948 DPA bar,\n\u201cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil[ians],\u201d contained\nno \u201c \u2018involuntary assistance\u2019 exception.\u201d Fedorenko, 449\nU.

This Court must assume, absent textual proof to the\ncontrary, that Congress was aware of the Fedorenko deci\u00ad\nsion when it reenacted the persecutor bar and thus\n\u201cadopt[ed] that interpretation when it re-enact[ed the]\nstatute without change,\u201d Lorillard, supra, at 580.\n                           D\n  In sum, the INA\u2019s persecutor bar does not require that\n12                       NEGUSIE v.

See ante, at 2\u20133\n(majority opinion). It also is undisputed that petitioner\ncarried out the persecution by preventing prisoners from\nescaping and by standing guard while at least one pris\u00ad\noner died from sun exposure. Ibid. Petitioner, therefore,\n\u201cassisted, or otherwise participated\u201d in persecution and\nthus is statutorily disqualified from receiving asylum or\nwithholding of removal under the INA. 3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE STEVENS also finds the language of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\n\u201cplain,\u201d but concludes that it must incorporate a culpability require\u00ad\nment because the statute applies to those whose \u201cacts are of a \u2018criminal\nnature.\u2019 \u201d See ante, at 7, 9 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). I disagree. The decision to admit an alien is a matter of legisla\u00ad\ntive grace, see n. 2, supra, for which judicial review has been \u201cconsis\u00ad\ntently classified\u201d as civil in nature, Harisiades v.

INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.

But a\nstatute cannot be deemed ambiguous until the court \u201cex\u00ad\nhaust[s] the aid of the \u2018traditional tools of statutory con\u00ad\nstruction\u2019 \u201d and determines that Congress did not resolve\nthe issue under consideration. Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 402 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 9). Deeming a statute with\nbroad terms to be ambiguous for that reason alone essen\u00ad\ntially requires Congress either to obey a judicially imposed\nclear-statement rule or accept the risk that the courts may\nrefuse to give full effect to a statute\u2019s plain meaning in the\nname of Chevron deference. Not every difficult question of\nstatutory construction amounts to a statutory gap for a\nfederal agency to fill. See ante, at 1\u20134 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.). And the Court should not, \u201cin the name of\ndeference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a stat\u00ad\nute\u201d simply because it requires some effort.

See ante, at 5\u20136. Rather, it\nmerely observes that Congress could have spoken more\ndirectly to the issue, which it finds sufficient to render the\nstatute ambiguous on this score. Ante, at 6. But the\nabsence of a phrase specifying that the provision applies to\nboth involuntary and voluntary conduct is not definitive\nproof of ambiguity. It is certainly correct that Congress\n\u201c \u2018could have spoken in clearer terms,\u2019 \u201d Clark, 543 U. S., at\n402 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), as it almost always can in\nany statute. However, this \u201cproves nothing\u201d in evaluating\nwhether the statute is ambiguous. Ibid. The question\nbefore the Court instead is whether Congress has provided\nan unambiguous answer in the plain language that it\nchose to use. Here, for the reasons just explained, the\ntraditional tools of statutory interpretation show with\n\u201cutmost clarity,\u201d St. Cyr, supra, at 329, that the statute\napplies regardless of the voluntariness of the alien who\nparticipates or assists in persecution.4\n    The majority also finds ambiguity based on differences\nbetween the INA and the DPA statutory bar considered in\nFedorenko. In particular, the majority points to the Fe\ndorenko Court\u2019s reliance on a second part of the DPA\npersecutor bar, which applied to those who \u201c \u2018voluntarily\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Because this Court should not delegate the interpretation of the\n\npersecutor bar\u2019s plain meaning to a federal agency, see Board of Gover\nnors, FRS v. Dimension Financial Corp., 474 U. S. 361, 368 (1986), it is\nlargely irrelevant whether the BIA properly relied on Fedorenko v.\nUnited States, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), in interpreting the statute, see\nante, at 9\u201311 (majority opinion); ante, at 2 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In\nany event, the BIA\u2019s construction of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar correctly\nreflected the text of the provision. There is no reason to remand the\nquestion to the agency when only one construction of the statute is\npermissible and the agency\u2019s original decision adopted that proper\nconstruction. See National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982\u2013985 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S., at 495, and n. 3 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3052; emphasis added). The Court noted that\n\u201c[u]nder traditional principles of statutory construction,\nthe deliberate omission of the word \u2018voluntary\u2019 from \u00a72(a),\u201d\nwhich addressed the assistance of persecution\u2014but not\nfrom \u00a72(b)\u2014\u201ccompel[led] the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.\u201d Id., at 512. According to the major\u00ad\nity, because the INA persecutor bar, unlike the DPA bar,\ndoes not include a provision limited by the word \u201cvoluntar\u00ad\nily\u201d adjacent to the provision that is not so limited, the\nabsence of the adverb here cannot carry the significance\ngiven it in Fedorenko. See ante, at 7.\n   The majority\u2019s reasoning is flawed. The mere fact that\nthe INA\u2019s persecutor bar is not accompanied by a\nneighboring provision containing the word \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\ndoes not negate the significance of the term\u2019s absence\nwhen other INA provisions are explicitly limited to actions\nundertaken voluntarily. As noted above, see supra, at 7,\nthe INA imposes a voluntariness requirement in a host of\nstatutory provisions, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C. \u00a71158(c)(2)(D)\n(terminating asylum when alien has \u201cvoluntarily\u201d availed\nhimself     of    the    protection    of    his   country);\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(3)(D)(i)\u2013(ii) (denying admission and naturaliza\u00ad\ntion to those who have been members of, or affiliated with,\n\u201cthe Communist or any other totalitarian party\u201d unless\nthat membership or affiliation was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d);\n\u00a71182(d)(3)(B)(i) (denying admission to those who have\n\u201cvoluntarily and knowingly\u201d engaged in, endorsed, es\u00ad\npoused, or persuaded others to endorse, espouse, or sup\u00ad\nport terrorist activity); \u00a71229c(a)(1) (allowing an alien to\n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d depart the United States); \u00a7\u00a71424(a), (d)\n(precluding naturalization for members of certain totali\u00ad\ntarian parties, unless membership was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d);\n\u00a71481(a) (providing for loss of nationality by \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\n16                      NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nperforming certain specified acts with the intention of\nrelinquishing nationality).5\n  In the immigration and naturalization context, then,\nCongress is certainly capable of declaring its preference\nfor a voluntariness requirement. That Congress\u2019 explicit\nreferences to voluntariness appear in other sections of this\nparticular statutory scheme, rather than in subsections of\n\u00a7\u00a71158 or 1231, is immaterial. Cf. Rusello, 464 U. S., at\n23; Barnhart, 534 U. S., at 452\u2013454. And the fact that\nCongress, in the course of making structural revisions to\nthe statutory regime, eliminated the specific dichotomy\nthe Court noted in Fedorenko does not undermine the\ncritical point: The INA expressly includes a voluntariness\nrequirement in several places but does not impose such a\nrequirement in the persecution bar. Thus, the omission of\nthe word \u201cvoluntarily\u201d from the persecutor bar in the INA\nis just as conclusive as its omission from the persecutor\nbar in the DPA. With respect to both statutes, the delib\u00ad\nerate omission \u201ccompels the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.\u201d 449 U. S., at 512.\n  Finally, the majority concludes that the DPA bar is\ndistinguishable from the INA bar because the former was\nenacted in the context of the \u201c \u2018 \u201ccrime against humanity\nthat [was] involved in the concentration camp,\u201d \u2019 \u201d which\nwas so horrific that it is in a category all its own.

In that unique\ncontext, the majority reasons, it made sense to exclude\n\u201ceven those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assis\u00ad\ntance in Nazi persecution.\u201d Ibid. But the majority cannot\nintend to suggest that all acts of persecution during the\nSecond World War were inherently more depraved or\nreprehensible than all acts of persecution that have oc\u00ad\ncurred in the decades since the INA\u2019s enactment.\n   Certainly, no such conclusion is compelled by the statu\u00ad\ntory text. Congress has steadfastly condemned all acts of\npersecution. See 22 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a76401(a)(5)\u2013(7) (noting that\n\u201cCongress has recognized and denounced acts of religious\npersecution,\u201d which can be \u201csevere and violent\u201d and \u201cpar\u00ad\nticularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under to\u00ad\ntalitarian governments and in countries with militant\npoliticized religious majorities\u201d); \u00a76401(b)(5) (announcing\nthat it is the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d to \u201cstan[d] with\nthe persecuted\u201d); \u00a7501, 78 Stat. 1015 (\u201cThe Congress con\u00ad\ndemns the persecution of any persons because of their\nreligion\u201d); Refugee Act of 1980, \u00a7101(a), 94 Stat. 102 (\u201cThe\nCongress declares that it is the historic policy of the\nUnited States to respond to the urgent needs of persons\nsubject to persecution in their homelands\u201d). There is no\nreason to deny the INA persecutor bar its full meaning\nbased on a speculative assumption that Congress, in 1980,\ncould not have meant to oppose persecution quite as in\u00ad\ntensely as it did in the aftermath of World War II. Rather,\nthe INA\u2019s persecutor bar naturally extends to all acts of\npersecution and, therefore, requires the denial of asylum\nand withholding of removal for \u201ceven those involved in\nnonculpable, involuntary assistance in . . . persecution.\u201d\nAnte, at 8 (majority opinion).\n                           IV\n Because I conclude that the INA\u2019s persecutor bar applies\nwhether or not petitioner\u2019s assistance or participation in\n18                 NEGUSIE v.

Argued November 5, 2008\u2014Decided March 3, 2009\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) bars an alien from obtain\n  ing refugee status in this country if he \u201cassisted, or otherwise partici\n  pated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\n  nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n  opinion.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(42). This so-called \u201cpersecutor bar\u201d ap\n  plies to those seeking asylum or withholding of removal, but does not\n  disqualify an alien from receiving a temporary deferral of removal\n  under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\n  Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). During the time peti\n  tioner, an Eritrean national, was forced to work as a prison guard in\n  that country, the prisoners he guarded were persecuted on grounds\n  protected under \u00a71101(a)(42). After escaping to the United States,\n  petitioner applied for asylum and withholding of removal. Conclud\n  ing that he assisted in the persecution of prisoners by working as an\n  armed guard, the Immigration Judge denied relief on the basis of the\n  persecutor bar, but granted deferral of removal under CAT because\n  petitioner was likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea. The Board\n  of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in all respects, holding, inter\n  alia, that the persecutor bar applies even if the alien\u2019s assistance in\n  persecution was coerced or otherwise the product of duress. The BIA\n  followed its earlier decisions finding Fedorenko v. United States, 449\n  U. S. 490, controlling. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, relying on its\n  precedent following the same reasoning.\nHeld: The BIA and Fifth Circuit misapplied Fedorenko as mandating\n that whether an alien is compelled to assist in persecution is immate\n rial for prosecutor-bar purposes.

When the BIA has not spoken on \u201ca\n    matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands,\u201d this Court\u2019s\n    ordinary rule is to remand to allow \u201cthe BIA . . . to address the mat\n    ter in the first instance in light of its own experience.\u201d INS v. Or\n    lando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16\u201317. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) As there is substance both to petitioner\u2019s contention that invol\n    untary acts cannot implicate the persecutor bar because \u201cpersecu\n    tion\u201d presumes moral blameworthiness, and to the Government\u2019s ar\n    gument that the question at issue is answered by the statute\u2019s failure\n    to provide an exception for coerced conduct, it must be concluded that\n    the INA has an ambiguity that the BIA should address in the first in\n    stance. Fedorenko, which addressed a different statute enacted for a\n    different purpose, does not control the BIA\u2019s interpretation of this\n    persecutor bar. In holding that voluntariness was not required with\n    respect to such a bar in the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 (DPA), Fe\n    dorenko contrasted the omission there of the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d with\n    the word\u2019s inclusion in a related statutory subsection. 449 U. S., at\n    512. Because Congress did not use the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d anywhere in\n    the persecutor bar at issue here, its omission cannot carry the same\n    significance as it did in Fedorenko. Moreover, the DPA\u2019s exclusion of\n    even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assistance in perse\n    cution was enacted in part to address the Holocaust and its horror,\n    see id., at 511, n. 32, whereas the persecutor bar in this case was en\n    acted as part of the Refugee Act of 1980, which was designed to pro\n    vide a general rule for the ongoing treatment of all refugees and dis\n    placed persons, see, e.g., Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 427. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (c) Whether a BIA determination that the persecution bar contains\n    no exception for coerced conduct would be reasonable, and thus owed\n    Chevron deference, is a legitimate question; but it is not presented\n    here. In denying petitioner relief, the BIA recited a rule it has devel\n    oped in its cases: An alien\u2019s motivation and intent are irrelevant to\n    the issue whether he \u201cassisted\u201d in persecution; rather, his actions\u2019 ob\n    jective effect controls. A reading of those decisions confirms that the\n    BIA has not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead, has\n    deemed its interpretation to be mandated by Fedorenko. This error\n    prevented the BIA from fully considering the statutory question pre\n    sented. Its mistaken assumption stems from a failure to recognize\n    the inapplicability of the statutory construction principle invoked in\n    Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differences in statu\n    tory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply the Fedorenko rule to\n    the persecutor bar here at issue.

S. C. \u00a71101(a)(42).\nThis so-called \u201cpersecutor bar\u201d applies to those seeking\nasylum, \u00a71158(b)(2)(A)(i), or withholding of removal,\n\u00a71231(b)(3)(B)(i). It does not disqualify an alien from\nreceiving a temporary deferral of removal under the Con\nvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), art. 3, Dec.\n10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100\u201320, p. 20, 1465 U. N. T. S.\n85; 8 CFR \u00a71208.17(a) (2008).\n  In this case the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n2                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermined that the persecutor bar applies even if the\nalien\u2019s assistance in persecution was coerced or otherwise\nthe product of duress. In so ruling the BIA followed its\nearlier decisions that found Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), controlling. The Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit, in affirming the agency, relied on its\nprecedent following the same reasoning. We hold that the\nBIA and the Court of Appeals misapplied Fedorenko. We\nreverse and remand for the agency to interpret the stat\nute, free from the error, in the first instance.\n                                 I\n   Petitioner in this Court is Daniel Girmai Negusie, a\ndual national of Eritrea and Ethiopia, his father having\nbeen a national of the former and his mother of the latter.\nBorn and educated in Ethiopia, he left there for Eritrea\naround the age of 18 to see his mother and find employ\nment. The year was 1994. After a few months in Eritrea,\nstate officials took custody of petitioner and others when\nthey were attending a movie. He was forced to perform\nhard labor for a month and then was conscripted into the\nmilitary for a time. War broke out between Ethiopia and\nEritrea in 1998, and he was conscripted again.\n   When petitioner refused to fight against Ethiopia, his\nother homeland, the Eritrean Government incarcerated\nhim. Prison guards punished petitioner by beating him\nwith sticks and placing him in the hot sun. He was re\nleased after two years and forced to work as a prison\nguard, a duty he performed on a rotating basis for about\nfour years. It is undisputed that the prisoners he guarded\nwere being persecuted on account of a protected ground\u2014\ni.e., \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\nsocial group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101(a)(42).\nPetitioner testified that he carried a gun, guarded the gate\nto prevent escape, and kept prisoners from taking showers\nand obtaining fresh air. He also guarded prisoners to\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmake sure they stayed in the sun, which he knew was a\nform of punishment. He saw at least one man die after\nbeing in the sun for more than two hours. Petitioner\ntestified that he had not shot at or directly punished any\nprisoner and that he helped prisoners on various occa\nsions. Petitioner escaped from the prison and hid in a\ncontainer, which was loaded on board a ship heading to\nthe United States. Once here he applied for asylum and\nwithholding of removal.\n   In a careful opinion the Immigration Judge, W. Wayne\nStogner, found that petitioner\u2019s testimony, for the most\npart, was credible. He concluded that petitioner assisted\nin persecution by working as an armed guard. The judge\ndetermined that although \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence to establish\nthat [petitioner] is a malicious person or that he was an\naggressive person who mistreated the prisoners, . . . the\nvery fact that he helped [the government] in the prison\ncompound where he had reason to know that they were\npersecuted constitutes assisting in the persecution of\nothers and bars [petitioner] from\u201d obtaining asylum or\nwithholding of removal. App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a\u201317a\n(citing, inter alia, Fedorenko, supra). The judge, however,\ngranted deferral of removal under CAT because petitioner\nwas likely to be tortured if returned to Eritrea.\n   The BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding.\nIt noted petitioner\u2019s role as an armed guard in a facility\nwhere \u201cprisoners were tortured and left to die out in the\nsun . . . on account of a protected ground.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 6a. The BIA held that \u201c[t]he fact that [petitioner]\nwas compelled to participate as a prison guard, and may\nnot have actively tortured or mistreated anyone, is imma\nterial.\u201d Ibid. That is because \u201c \u2018an alien\u2019s motivation and\nintent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he \u201cassisted\u201d\nin persecution . . . [I]t is the objective effect of an alien\u2019s\nactions which is controlling.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Matter of\nFedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57, 69 (BIA 1984)). The BIA\n4                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nalso affirmed the grant of deferral of removal under CAT.\n  On petition for review the Court of Appeals agreed with\nthe BIA that whether an alien is compelled to assist in\npersecution is immaterial for persecutor-bar purposes.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 2a (citing Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at\n512, n. 34). We granted certiorari. 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n                             II\n  Consistent with the rule in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,\n842\u2013843 (1984), the BIA is entitled to deference in inter\npreting ambiguous provisions of the INA. The question\nhere is whether an alien who was compelled to assist in\npersecution can be eligible for asylum or withholding of\nremoval. We conclude that the BIA misapplied our prece\ndent in Fedorenko as mandating that an alien\u2019s motivation\nand intent are irrelevant to the issue whether an alien\nassisted in persecution. The agency must confront the\nsame question free of this mistaken legal premise.\n                              A\n   It is well settled that \u201cprinciples of Chevron deference\nare applicable to this statutory scheme.\u201d INS v. Aguirre-\nAguirre, 526 U. S. 415, 424 (1999). Congress has charged\nthe Attorney General with administering the INA, and a\n\u201cruling by the Attorney General with respect to all ques\ntions of law shall be controlling.\u201d 8 U. S. C. \u00a71103(a)(1).\nJudicial deference in the immigration context is of special\nimportance, for executive officials \u201cexercise especially\nsensitive political functions that implicate questions of\nforeign relations.\u201d INS v. Abudu, 485 U. S. 94, 100 (1988).\nThe Attorney General\u2019s decision to bar an alien who has\nparticipated in persecution \u201cmay affect our relations with\n[the alien\u2019s native] country or its neighbors. The judiciary\nis not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility\nfor assessing the likelihood and importance of such diplo\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmatic repercussions.\u201d Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 425.\n   The Attorney General, in turn, has delegated to the BIA\nthe \u201c \u2018discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney\nGeneral by law\u2019 \u201d in the course of \u201c \u2018considering and deter\nmining cases before it.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 8 CFR \u00a73.1(d)(1)\n(1998)). As a consequence, \u201cthe BIA should be accorded\nChevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms\n\u2018concrete meaning through a process of case-by-case adju\ndication.\u2019 \u201d Aguirre-Aguirre, supra, at 425 (quoting INS v.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 448\u2013449 (1987)). When\nthe BIA has not spoken on \u201ca matter that statutes place\nprimarily in agency hands,\u201d our ordinary rule is to remand\nto \u201cgiv[e] the BIA the opportunity to address the matter in\nthe first instance in light of its own experience.\u201d INS v.\nOrlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12, 16\u201317 (2002) (per curiam).\n                             B\n   The parties disagree over whether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution. As there is substance to both\ncontentions, we conclude that the statute has an ambigu\nity that the agency should address in the first instance.\n   Petitioner argues that the statute\u2019s plain language\nmakes clear that involuntary acts do not implicate the\npersecutor bar because \u201c \u2018persecution\u2019 \u201d presumes moral\nblameworthiness. Brief for Petitioner 23\u201328. He invokes\nprinciples of criminal culpability, concepts of international\nlaw, and the rule of lenity. Id., at 28\u201345. Those argu\nments may be persuasive in determining whether a par\nticular agency interpretation is reasonable, but they do\nnot demonstrate that the statute is unambiguous. Peti\ntioner all but conceded as much at argument in this Court\nwhen he indicated that the BIA has discretion to construe\nthe duress defense in either a narrow or a broad way. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 20\u201324.\n   The Government, on the other hand, asserts that the\n6                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute does not allow petitioner\u2019s construction. \u201cThe\nstatutory text,\u201d the Government says, \u201cdirectly answers\nthat question: there is no exception\u201d for conduct that is\ncoerced because Congress did not include one. Brief for\nRespondent 11. We disagree. The silence is not conclu\nsive. The question is whether the statutory text mandates\nthat coerced actions must be deemed assistance in perse\ncution. On that point the statute, in its precise terms, is\nnot explicit. Nor is this a case where it is clear that Con\ngress had an intention on the precise question at issue.\nCf. Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, at 448\u2013449.\n  The Government, like the BIA and the Court of Appeals,\nrelies on Fedorenko to provide the answer. This reliance is\nnot without some basis, as the Court there held that vol\nuntariness was not required with respect to another per\nsecutor bar. 449 U. S., at 512. To the extent, however, the\nGovernment deems Fedorenko to be controlling, it is in\nerror.\n  In Fedorenko, the Court interpreted the Displaced Per\nsons Act of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009. The DPA was\nenacted \u201cto enable European refugees driven from their\nhomelands by the [second world] war to emigrate to the\nUnited States without regard to traditional immigration\nquotas.\u201d 449 U. S., at 495. Section 2(b) of the DPA pro\nvides relief to \u201cany displaced person or refugee as defined\nin Annex I of the Constitution of the International Refugee\nOrganization\u201d of the United Nations (IRO Constitution).\n62 Stat. 1009. The IRO Constitution, as codified by Con\ngress, excludes any individual \u201cwho can be shown: (a) to\nhave assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations of\ncountries, Members of the United Nations; or (b) to have\nvoluntarily assisted the enemy forces since the outbreak of\nthe second world war in their operations against the\nUnited Nations.\u201d Annex I, Part II, \u00a72, 62 Stat. 3051\u20133052.\n  The Fedorenko Court held that \u201can individual\u2019s service\nas a concentration camp armed guard\u2014whether voluntary\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor involuntary\u2014made him ineligible for a visa\u201d under\n\u00a72(a) of the IRO Constitution. 449 U. S., at 512. That\nCongress did not adopt a voluntariness requirement for\n\u00a72(a), the Court noted, \u201cis plain from comparing \u00a72(a) with\n\u00a72(b), which excludes only those individuals who \u2018voluntar\nily assisted the enemy forces.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The Court relied on\nthe principle of statutory construction that \u201cthe deliberate\nomission of the word \u2018voluntary\u2019 from \u00a72(a) compels the\nconclusion that the statute made all those who assisted in\npersecution of civilians ineligible for visas.\u201d Ibid.\n   Fedorenko does not compel the same conclusion in the\ncase now before us. The textual structure of the statute in\nFedorenko (\u201cvoluntary\u201d is in one subsection but not the\nother) is not part of the statutory framework considered\nhere. Congress did not use the word \u201cvoluntary\u201d in any\nsubsection of the persecutor bar, so its omission cannot\ncarry the same significance.\n   The difference between the statutory scheme in Fe\ndorenko and the one here is confirmed when we \u201c \u2018look not\nonly to the particular statutory language, but to the design\nof the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.\u2019 \u201d\nDada v. Mukasey, 554 U. S. 1, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 13)\n(quoting Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 407\n(1991)). Both statutes were enacted to reflect principles\nset forth in international agreements, but the principles\ndiffer in significant respects.\n   As discussed, Congress enacted the DPA in 1948 as part\nof an international effort to address individuals who were\nforced to leave their homelands during and after the sec\nond World War. Fedorenko, supra, at 495. The DPA\nexcludes those who \u201cvoluntarily assisted the enemy forces\nsince the outbreak of the second world war,\u201d 62 Stat. 3052,\nas well as all who \u201cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil\npopulations of countries,\u201d id., at 3051. The latter exclu\nsion clause makes no reference to culpability. The exclu\nsion of even those involved in nonculpable, involuntary\n8                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nassistance in Nazi persecution, as an expert testified in\nFedorenko, may be \u201c \u2018[b]ecause the crime against humanity\nthat is involved in the concentration camp puts it into a\ndifferent category.\u2019 \u201d 449 U. S., at 511, n. 32.\n  The persecutor bar in this case, by contrast, was enacted\nas part of the Refugee Act of 1980. Unlike the DPA, which\nwas enacted to address not just the post war refugee\nproblem but also the Holocaust and its horror, the Refugee\nAct was designed to provide a general rule for the ongoing\ntreatment of all refugees and displaced persons. As this\nCourt has twice recognized, \u201c \u2018one of Congress\u2019 primary\npurposes\u2019 in passing the Refugee Act was to implement the\nprinciples agreed to in the 1967 United Nations Protocol\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19\nU. S. T. 6224, T. I. A. S. 6577 (1968),\u201d as well as the\n\u201cUnited Nations Convention Relating to the Status of\nRefugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150 (July 28, 1951), reprinted in\n19 U. S. T. 6259.\u201d Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S., at 427 (quot\ning Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 436\u2013437).\n  These authorities illustrate why Fedorenko, which\naddressed a different statute enacted for a different pur\npose, does not control the BIA\u2019s interpretation of this\npersecutor bar. Whatever weight or relevance these vari\nous authorities may have in interpreting the statute\nshould be considered by the agency in the first instance,\nand by any subsequent reviewing court, after our remand.\n                             C\n   The Government argues that \u201cif there were any ambigu\nity in the text, the Board\u2019s determination that the bar\ncontains no such exception is reasonable and thus control\nling.\u201d Brief for Respondent 11. Whether such an interpre\ntation would be reasonable, and thus owed Chevron defer\nence, is a legitimate question; but it is not now before us.\nThe BIA deemed its interpretation to be mandated by\nFedorenko, and that error prevented it from a full consid\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

[I]t\nis the objective effect of an alien\u2019s actions which is control\nling.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a. The rule is based on three\nearlier decisions: Matter of Laipenieks, 18 I. & N. Dec. 433\n(1983); Matter of Fedorenko, 19 I. & N. Dec. 57; and Matter\nof Rodriguez-Majano, 19 I. & N. Dec. 811 (1988).\n   In Matter of Laipenieks, the BIA applied the Court\u2019s\nFedorenko analysis of the DPA to a different postwar\nstatute, which provided for the deportation of anyone\nassociated with the Nazis who \u201cordered, incited, assisted,\nor otherwise participated\u201d in persecution based on a pro\ntected ground. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i). Finding no\nagency or judicial decision on point, the BIA relied on\nFedorenko. It recognized that the unique structure of the\nFedorenko statute was not present in \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i), but\nthe BIA nevertheless adopted wholesale the Fedorenko\nrule: \u201c[A]s in Fedorenko, . . . the plain language of\n[\u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i)] mandates a literal interpretation, and\nthe omission of an intent element compels the conclusion\nthat [\u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i)] makes all those who assisted in the\nspecific persecution deportable.\u201d 18 I. & N. Dec., at 464.\nIn other words, \u201cparticular motivations or intent . . . is not\na relevant factor.\u201d Ibid.\n   The second decision, Matter of Fedorenko, also dealt\nwith \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i), and it involved the same alien\nwhose citizenship was revoked by this Court\u2019s Fedorenko\ndecision. This time the agency sought to deport him.\nFedorenko responded by requesting suspension of deporta\ntion. He argued that, unlike the DPA\u2019s bar on any assis\ntance\u2014voluntary or involuntary\u2014in persecution, see\nFedorenko, 449 U. S., at 512, the text and structure of\n\u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i) required deportation only of those who\n10                    NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nvoluntarily assisted in persecuting others. The BIA re\njected that distinction, noting that it was foreclosed by\nMatter of Laipenieks: \u201cIt may be, as [Fedorenko] argues,\nthat his service at Treblinka was involuntary. . . . We\nneed not resolve the issue, however, because as a matter of\nlaw [Fedorenko\u2019s] motivations for serving as a guard at\nTreblinka are immaterial to the question of his deportabil\nity under\u201d \u00a71182(a)(3)(E)(i). 19 I. & N. Dec., at 69\u201370.\n   Later, the BIA applied this Court\u2019s Fedorenko rule to\nthe persecutor bar that is at issue in the present case. In\nMatter of Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA granted relief be\ncause the alien\u2019s coerced conduct as a guerrilla was not\npersecution based on a protected ground. 19 I. & N. Dec.,\nat 815\u2013816. Nevertheless, in reaching its conclusion the\nBIA incorporated without additional analysis the Fe\ndorenko rule as applied in Matter of Laipenieks and reiter\nated in Matter of Fedorenko. 19 I. & N. Dec., at 814\u2013815.\nThe BIA reaffirmed that \u201c[t]he participation or assistance\nof an alien in persecution need not be of his own volition to\nbar him from relief.\u201d Id., at 814 (citing Fedorenko, 449\nU. S. 490).\n   Our reading of these decisions confirms that the BIA\nhas not exercised its interpretive authority but, instead,\nhas determined that Fedorenko controls. This mistaken\nassumption stems from a failure to recognize the inappli\ncability of the principle of statutory construction invoked\nin Fedorenko, as well as a failure to appreciate the differ\nences in statutory purpose. The BIA is not bound to apply\nthe Fedorenko rule that motive and intent are irrelevant\nto the persecutor bar at issue in this case. Whether the\nstatute permits such an interpretation based on a differ\nent course of reasoning must be determined in the first\ninstance by the agency.\n                             III\n     Having concluded that the BIA has not yet exercised its\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

This remand rule exists, in part,\nbecause \u201cambiguities in statutes within an agency\u2019s juris\ndiction to administer are delegations of authority to the\nagency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.\nFilling these gaps . . . involves difficult policy choices that\nagencies are better equipped to make than courts.\u201d Na\ntional Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X\nInternet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 980 (2005).\n    JUSTICE STEVENS would have the Court provide a defi\nnite answer to the question presented and then remand\nfor further proceedings. That approach, however, is in\ntension with the \u201cordinary \u2018remand\u2019 rule.\u201d Ventura, supra,\nat 18; see also Cajun Elec. Power Cooperative, Inc. v.\nFERC, 924 F. 2d 1132, 1136 (CADC 1991) (opinion for the\nCourt by Silberman, J., joined by R. Ginsburg and Tho\nmas, JJ.) (\u201c[I]f an agency erroneously contends that Con\ngress\u2019 intent has been clearly expressed and has rested on\nthat ground, we remand to require the agency to consider\nthe question afresh in light of the ambiguity we see\u201d).\nThomas is illustrative. There, the agency had not deter\nmined whether a family may constitute a social group for\nthe purposes of refugee status. The Ninth Circuit held\nthat the family can constitute a protected social group and\nthat the particular family at issue did qualify. 547 U. S.,\nat 184\u2013185. The Solicitor General sought review in this\nCourt on \u201cwhether the Ninth Circuit erred in holding, in\nthe first instance and without prior resolution of the ques\ntions by the relevant administrative agency, that members\nof a family can and do constitute a particular social group,\nwithin the meaning of the Act.\u201d Id., at 185 (internal quo\n12                  NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntation marks omitted). He argued that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\ndecision violated the Ventura ordinary remand rule. We\nagreed and summarily reversed. 547 U. S., at 184\u2013185\n    Ventura and Thomas counsel a similar result here.\nBecause of the important differences between the statute\nbefore us and the one at issue in Fedorenko, we find it\nappropriate to remand to the agency for its initial deter\nmination of the statutory interpretation question and its\napplication to this case. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the\nstatutory meaning of \u201cpersecution\u201d may be explained by a\nmore comprehensive definition, one designed to elaborate\non the term in anticipation of a wide range of potential\nconduct; and that expanded definition in turn may be\ninfluenced by how practical, or impractical, the standard\nwould be in terms of its application to specific cases.\nThese matters may have relevance in determining\nwhether its statutory interpretation is a permissible one.\n    As the Court said in Ventura and reiterated in Thomas,\n\u201c \u2018[t]he agency can bring its expertise to bear upon the\nmatter; it can evaluate the evidence; it can make an initial\ndetermination; and, in doing so, it can, through informed\ndiscussion and analysis, help a court later determine\nwhether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law\nprovides.\u2019 \u201d 547 U. S., at 186\u2013187 (quoting Ventura, supra,\nat 17). If the BIA decides to adopt a standard that consid\ners voluntariness to some degree, it may be prudent and\nnecessary for the Immigration Judge to conduct additional\nfactfinding based on the new standard. Those determina\ntions are for the agency to make in the first instance.\n                     *     *    *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

ERIC\n     H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, con\ncurring.\n   I agree with the Court that \u201cthe statute has an ambigu\nity,\u201d ante, at 5, with respect to whether an alien who was\ncoerced to assist in persecution is barred from obtaining\nasylum in the United States. I agree that the agency is\nentitled to answer that question. Ibid. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837, 843 (1984). And I agree that a remand is in\norder, to give the agency an opportunity to clarify whether\nits affirmative answer was premised on an erroneous view\nthat this Court\u2019s decision in Fedorenko v. United States,\n449 U. S. 490 (1981), compelled it. Ante, at 11.\n   I would not agree to remand if I did not think that the\nagency has the option of adhering to its decision. The\nmajority appears to leave that question undecided, ante, at\n5 (reserving whether \u201ca particular agency interpretation is\nreasonable\u201d); two Justices forthrightly disagree and would\nrequire the agency to recognize at least some sort of du\nress exception, post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part).\n   But good reasons for the agency\u2019s current practice ex\nist\u2014reasons adequate to satisfy the requirement that an\nagency act reasonably in choosing among various possible\nconstructions of an ambiguous statute. The statute does\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nnot mandate the rule precluding the duress defense but\ndoes not foreclose it either; the agency is free to retain\nthat rule so long as the choice to do so is soundly rea\nsoned, not based on irrelevant or arbitrary factors (like\nthe Fedorenko precedent).\n   The primary contention to the contrary is, in short, that\nbarring aliens who persecuted under duress would punish\npurely \u201cnonculpable\u201d conduct. That argument suffers from\nat least three unjustified leaps of logic.\n   First, it implicitly adopts a view of \u201cculpability\u201d that is\nneither the only view nor one necessarily applicable here.\nThe culpability of one who harms another under coercion\nis, and has always been, a subject of intense debate, rais\ning profound questions of moral philosophy and individual\nresponsibility. (The so-called \u201cNuremberg defense\u201d comes\nreadily to mind.) At common law, duress was not an\naccepted defense to intentional killing, see 2 W. LaFave,\nSubstantive Criminal Law \u00a79.7(b), pp. 74\u201375 (2d ed. 2003);\nand in modern times, some states do not allow it as a\ndefense to lesser crimes, see id., at 81\u201382, and n. 50.\nNotably, there is no historical support for the duress\ndefense when a soldier follows a military order he knows\nto be unlawful. Id., \u00a79.7(g), at 86; see also, e.g., Axtell\u2019s\nCase, Kel. J. 13, 84 Eng. Rep. 1060 (1660); Prosecutor v.\nErdemovi\u0107, [1997] 2 ICTY Jud. Rep. 1610, 1635 (Int\u2019l\nCrim. Trib. for Former Yugoslavia). It is therefore far\nfrom clear that precluding a duress defense here would, as\npetitioner alleges, \u201cdisregard principles of blame . . . \u2018uni\nversal and persistent\u2019 in American law.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner 32 (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S.\n246, 250 (1952)). All of this suggests that those who are\ncoerced to commit wrong are at least sometimes \u201cculpable\u201d\nenough to be treated as criminals.\n   More importantly, this is not a criminal matter. This\nCourt has long understood that an \u201corder of deportation is\nnot a punishment for crime.\u201d Fong Yue Ting v. United\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nStates, 149 U. S. 698, 730 (1893). Asylum is a benefit\naccorded by grace, not by entitlement, and withholding\nthat benefit from all who have intentionally harmed oth\ners\u2014whether under coercion or not\u2014is not unreasonable.\n   Second, petitioner assumes that the persecutor bar must\nhave been intended merely to punish wrongdoing. But in\nthe context of immigration law, \u201cculpability\u201d as a relevant\nfactor in determining admissibility is only one facet of a\nmore general consideration: desirability. And there may\nwell be reasons to think that those who persecuted others,\neven under duress, would be relatively undesirable as\nimmigrants. If, for example, the asylum laws grant entry\nto those who suffered the persecution, might it not be\nimprudent to also grant entry to the coerced persecutor,\nwho may end up living in the same community as one of\nhis victims? The Nation has a legitimate interest in pre\nventing the importation of ethnic strife from remote parts\nof the world, and the agency may resolve the statutory\nambiguity in a way that safeguards that interest.\n   Finally, even if culpability is the only relevant factor,\nand even if a narrow, criminal-law based view of culpabil\nity is the authoritative one, a bright-line rule excluding all\npersecutors\u2014whether acting under coercion or not\u2014might\nstill be the best way for the agency to effectuate the statu\ntory scheme. See generally Cox & Posner, Second-Order\nStructure of Immigration Law, 59 Stan. L. Rev. 809\n(2007). Immigration judges already face the overwhelm\ning task of attempting to recreate, by a limited number of\nwitnesses speaking through (often poor-quality) transla\ntion, events that took place years ago in foreign, usually\nimpoverished countries. See Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F. 3d\n228, 261\u2013262 (CA3 2003) (en banc) (Alito, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part). Adding on top of that the\nburden of adjudicating claims of duress and coercion,\nwhich are extremely difficult to corroborate and necessar\nily pose questions of degree that require intensely fact\n4                       NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nbound line-drawing, would increase the already inherently\nhigh risk of error. And the cost of error (viz., allowing\nuncoerced persecutors to remain in the country perma\nnently) might reasonably be viewed by the agency as\nsignificantly greater than the cost of overinclusion under a\nbright-line rule (viz., denial of asylum to some coerced\npersecutors\u2014who might anyway be entitled to protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture, which includes no\nanalogous persecutor bar).\n   It is worth noting that although the agency\u2019s \u201cobjective\neffects\u201d approach to the statute would seem to sweep\nbeyond the duress scenario to encompass even an alien\nwho had no idea that his actions would \u201cobjectively\u201d assist\nin persecution, see Casta\u00f1eda-Castillo v. Gonzales, 488\nF. 3d 17, 20 (CA1 2007) (en banc), there is no reason why\nthe agency cannot consider questions of knowledge sepa\nrate and apart from questions of duress. Both can be said\nto relate to the mental state of the persecutor,* but they\npresent different problems which can be grappled with\nseparately.     The agency need not provide an \u201call\nembracing answer,\u201d ibid., in the present case. It may\nevaluate problems one by one as they arise, and whatever\nit might decide about an unknowing persecutor is irrele\nvant to petitioner, who knew exactly what he was doing.\n   To be clear, I do not endorse any particular rule. It is to\nagency officials, not to the Members of this Court, that\nCongress has given discretion to choose among permissible\ninterpretations of the statute. They deserve to be told\nclearly whether we are serious about allowing them to\nexercise that discretion, or are rather firing a warning\nshot across the bow.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The rationale for the duress defense, however, is conventionally \u201cnot\nthat the defendant . . . somehow loses his mental capacity to commit\nthe crime in question,\u201d but rather that \u201ceven though he has done the\nact the crime requires and has the mental state which the crime re\nquires, his conduct . . . is excused.\u201d 2 LaFave, supra, \u00a79.7(a), at 73.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B),\ndisqualifies from asylum or withholding of removal an\nalien whose conduct was coerced or otherwise the product\nof duress. If the answer to that threshold question is \u201cno,\u201d\ncourts should defer to the Attorney General\u2019s evaluation of\nparticular circumstances that may or may not establish\nduress or coercion in individual cases. But the threshold\nquestion the Court addresses today is a \u201cpure question of\nstatutory construction for the courts to decide.\u201d INS v.\nCardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 446 (1987). For that\nreason, while I agree with the Court\u2019s cogent explanation\nof why its misguided decision in Fedorenko v. United\nStates, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), does not govern our interpre\u00ad\ntation of the persecutor bar, I would provide a definite\nanswer to the question presented and then remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n                           I\n  Judicial deference to agencies\u2019 views on statutes they\nadminister was not born in Chevron U.

HOLDER\n\n                        Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nnor did the \u201csingularly judicial role of marking the\nboundaries of agency choice,\u201d Young v. Community Nutri\u00ad\ntion Institute, 476 U. S. 974, 988 (1986) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting), die with that case. In the years before Chev\u00ad\nron, this Court recognized that statutory interpretation is\na multifaceted enterprise, ranging from a precise construc\u00ad\ntion of statutory language to a determination of what\npolicy best effectuates statutory objectives. We accord\u00ad\ningly acknowledged that a complete interpretation of a\nstatutory provision might demand both judicial construc\u00ad\ntion and administrative explication. E.g., NLRB v. Hearst\nPublications, Inc., 322 U. S. 111 (1944) (construing the\nterm \u201cemployee\u201d in the National Labor Relations Act but\ndeferring to the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s finding\nthat newsboys were employees); see Nathanson, Adminis\u00ad\ntrative Discretion in the Interpretation of Statutes, 3\nVand. L. Rev. 470 (1950).\n   Chevron adhered to this approach. There, we recognized\nthat the Clean Air Act did not define \u201cstationary source,\u201d\n42 U. S. C. \u00a77502(b)(6) (1982 ed.), but rather implicitly\ndelegated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nthe policy question whether States could treat entire\nplants or only their discrete pollution-emitting devices as\nsources of pollution for purposes of the Act\u2019s permit pro\u00ad\ngram. Congress left a gap for the agency to fill, and the\nagency brought its expertise, political acuity, and informa\u00ad\ntion-gathering abilities to bear in doing so. See Chevron,\n467 U. S., at 865\u2013866.1 In keeping with precedent, see id.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Notably,\n             the EPA cast its activity not as statutory construction but\nas public administration; its rulemaking sought to achieve policy goals,\nsuch as reducing regulatory complexity and promoting plant moderni\u00ad\nzation. See 46 Fed. Reg. 50766 (1981). To be sure, the EPA argued\nthat its regulation defining \u201cstationary source\u201d as an entire plant was\npermissible under the Clean Air Act, but the agency treated its rule\u00ad\nmaking as a matter of fashioning sound policy, not of discerning the\nmeaning of \u201cstationary source\u201d in the statute.\n                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                3\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nat 843\u2013845, and nn. 9, 11\u201314, our opinion reaffirmed both\nthat \u201c[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of\nstatutory construction,\u201d id., at 843, n. 9, and that courts\nshould defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable formulation of\npolicy in response to an explicit or implicit congressional\ndelegation of authority. The Chevron framework thus\naccounts for the different institutional competencies of\nagencies and courts: Courts are expert at statutory con\u00ad\nstruction, while agencies are expert at statutory imple\u00ad\nmentation. That the distinction can be subtle does not\nlessen its importance.\n   In the 25 years since Chevron was decided, this Court\nhas continued to recognize that courts and agencies play\ncomplementary roles in the project of statutory interpreta\u00ad\ntion. We have repeatedly held that \u201cambiguities in stat\u00ad\nutes within an agency\u2019s jurisdiction to administer are\ndelegations of authority to the agency to fill the statutory\ngap in reasonable fashion.\u201d National Cable & Telecom\u00ad\nmunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S.\n967, 980 (2005). But even when confronted with a statute\nthat involves a degree of ambiguity\u2014as most statutes do\u2014\nwe have not abdicated our judicial role. The fact that\nCongress has left a gap for the agency to fill means that\ncourts should defer to the agency\u2019s reasonable gap-filling\ndecisions, not that courts should cease to mark the bounds\nof delegated agency choice.2\n   In cases involving agency adjudication, we have some\u00ad\ntimes described the court\u2019s role as deciding pure questions\nof statutory construction and the agency\u2019s role as applying\nlaw to fact. See, e.g., Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S. 421;\nNLRB v. Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U. S. 112\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Cf. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.

While this phrasing is peculiar to\nthe adjudicatory context, the principle applies to Chevron\u2019s\ndomain more broadly. In the context of agency rulemak\u00ad\ning, for instance, we might distinguish between pure\nquestions of statutory interpretation and policymaking, or\nbetween central legal issues and interstitial questions.\nSee Barnhart v.

What matters is the principle: Cer\u00ad\ntain aspects of statutory interpretation remain within the\npurview of the courts, even when the statute is not en\u00ad\ntirely clear, while others are properly understood as dele\u00ad\ngated by Congress to an expert and accountable adminis\u00ad\ntrative body. Statutory language may thus admit of both\njudicial construction and agency exposition.\n                             II\n   Two of this Court\u2019s cases construing the Immigration\nand Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 166, 8 U. S. C. \u00a71101\net seq., illustrate the proper division of responsibility\nbetween courts and agencies and highlight when Chevron\ndeference is appropriate and when it is not. In Cardoza-\nFonseca, the question was whether the standard of INA\n\u00a7243(h), 8 U. S. C. \u00a71253(h) (1982 ed.), which requires an\nalien to show that she is more likely than not to be subject\nto persecution if she is deported, also governs applications\nfor asylum under \u00a7208(a), 8 U. S. C. \u00a71158(a) (1982 ed.),\nwhich authorizes the Attorney General to grant asylum to\nan alien who has a well-founded fear of persecution in her\nhome country. After considering the INA\u2019s language, its\nlegislative history, and the United Nations Protocol that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Administrative Procedure Act draws a similar distinction in\n\nproviding that courts \u201cshall decide all relevant questions of law [and]\ninterpret constitutional and statutory provisions\u201d but shall review\n\u201cagency action, findings, and conclusions\u201d under the arbitrary and\ncapricious/abuse of discretion standard. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nCongress had implemented, the Court determined that the\ntwo standards are not the same.\n   In so holding, we decisively rejected the Government\u2019s\ncontention, echoed by JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence in the\njudgment, that the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA)\ninterpretation of the statute merited deference under our\nthen-recent decision in Chevron. \u201cThe question whether\nCongress intended the two standards to be identical is a\npure question of statutory construction for the courts to\ndecide,\u201d we stated. 480 U. S., at 446. We therefore did not\ndefer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the two standards as\nequivalent but instead employed traditional tools of statu\u00ad\ntory construction and \u201cconcluded that Congress did not\nintend the two standards to be identical.\u201d Ibid.4\n   Importantly, we recognized that Chevron deference need\nnot be an all-or-nothing venture. Even after the question\nof the standards\u2019 equivalency was resolved, there re\u00ad\nmained the question of their application. We explained,\n\u201cThe narrow legal question whether the two standards are\nthe same is, of course, quite different from the question of\ninterpretation that arises in each case in which the agency\nis required to apply either or both standards to a particu\u00ad\nlar set of facts.\u201d 480 U. S., at 448. And we noted that\napplying the INA was a task particularly suited to the\nagency\u2019s unique competencies: \u201cThere is obviously some\nambiguity in a term like \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 which can only\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 JUSTICE SCALIA objected in particular to the majority\u2019s holding that\n\npure questions of statutory construction are for the courts, not agencies,\nto decide; he insisted this was unfaithful to Chevron, \u201csince in Chevron\nthe Court deferred to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s abstract\ninterpretation of the phrase \u2018stationary source.\u2019 \u201d 480 U. S., at 455\n(opinion concurring in judgment). The majority rejected JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s argument, recognizing that Chevron involved an agency\u2019s\ncomplex policy judgment about how to fill a statutory gap, not a pure\nquestion of statutory construction. See 480 U. S., at 445\u2013448, and n. 29\n(quoting extensively from Chevron).\n6                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nbe given concrete meaning through a process of case-by\u00ad\ncase adjudication. In that process of filling \u2018 \u201cany gap left,\nimplicitly or explicitly by Congress,\u201d \u2019 the courts must\nrespect the interpretation of the agency to which Congress\nhas delegated the responsibility for administering the\nstatutory program.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at\n843, in turn quoting Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U. S. 199, 231\n(1974)).\n  In INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U. S. 415 (1999), the\nCourt encountered just the type of agency decision Car\u00ad\ndoza-Fonseca indicated would warrant Chevron deference.\nThe BIA had denied withholding of deportation because it\nfound that the respondent had \u201ccommitted a serious non\u00ad\npolitical crime\u201d before he entered the United States, 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71253(h)(2)(C) (1994 ed.). The Court of Appeals\nreversed the agency\u2019s decision and required it to supple\u00ad\nment its balancing test with specific additional factors\n(such as whether the respondent\u2019s acts were grossly out of\nproportion to their objective and whether the acts were\npolitically necessary and successful).\n  We reversed the Court of Appeals, concluding that\nChevron deference should be accorded to the BIA \u201cas it\ngives ambiguous statutory terms \u2018concrete meaning\nthrough a process of case-by-case adjudication.\u2019 \u201d 526 U. S.,\nat 425 (quoting Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S., at 448). The\nBIA\u2019s formulation of a test to apply the statutory standard\nin individual cases and its application of that test in re\u00ad\nspondent\u2019s case were precisely the sort of agency actions\nthat merited judicial deference.\n                           III\n  The threshold question the Court addresses today is the\nkind of \u201cpure question of statutory construction for the\ncourts to decide\u201d that we answered in Cardoza-Fonseca,\nid., at 446, rather than a fact-intensive question of the\nkind we addressed in Aguirre-Aguirre. Just as we decided\n                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     7\n\n                         Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\nthe narrow legal question presented in Cardoza-Fonseca\nbut did not \u201cattempt to set forth a detailed description of\nhow the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 test should be applied,\u201d 480\nU. S., at 448, I would decide the narrow legal question now\nbefore us and remand for the agency to determine how the\npersecutor bar applies in individual cases.5\n  For reasons similar to those set forth in my dissent in\nFedorenko, I think it plain that the persecutor bar does\nnot disqualify from asylum or withholding of removal an\nalien whose conduct was coerced or otherwise the product\nof duress. Although I agree in full with the Court\u2019s con\u00ad\nclusion that the majority opinion in Fedorenko does not\ngovern our interpretation of the persecutor bar, the differ\u00ad\nences the Court highlights between the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), 62 Stat. 1009, and the Refugee Act of\n1980, 94 Stat. 102, only strengthen my conclusion that\nvoluntary assistance in persecution is required and that\nduress and coercion vitiate voluntariness.\n  The Fedorenko Court\u2019s construction of the DPA threat\u00ad\nened to exclude from the United States concentration\ncamp prisoners who were forced to assist the Nazis in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 The majority suggests that this approach is inconsistent with the\n\n\u201c \u2018ordinary \u201cremand\u201d rule\u2019 \u201d articulated in Gonzales v. Thomas, 547 U. S.\n183 (2006) (per curiam), and INS v. Orlando Ventura, 537 U. S. 12\n(2002) (per curiam). Ante, at 11\u201312. But those cases involved exactly\nthe sort of application of law to fact that is within the agency\u2019s purview.\nIn Thomas, the Court of Appeals decided that the family at issue \u201cfell\nwithin the scope of the statutory term \u2018particular social group.\u2019 \u201d 547\nU. S., at 185. We noted that the BIA had not considered this question,\nwhich \u201crequire[d] determining the facts and deciding whether the facts\nas found f[e]ll within a statutory term.\u201d Id., at 186. Accordingly, we\nheld that the court should have remanded to the agency. Similarly, in\nVentura, the Court of Appeals addressed an issue that the BIA had not\nreached and concluded that conditions in Guatemala had so improved\nthat no realistic threat of persecution currently existed. The Govern\u00ad\nment argued that the court had not respected \u201cthe BIA\u2019s role as fact\u00ad\nfinder,\u201d 537 U. S., at 16, and we agreed, reversing the court\u2019s judgment\ninsofar as it had not remanded to the agency.\n8                      NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                       Opinion of STEVENS, J.\n\npersecution of other prisoners. In my view, this construc\u00ad\ntion was insupportable\u2014the DPA\u2019s exclusion of persons\nwho \u201cassisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations,\u201d\nConstitution of the International Refugee Organization,\nAnnex I, Part II, \u00a72(a), 62 Stat. 3051, did not extend to\nconcentration camp prisoners who did so involuntarily.\nThese prisoners were victims, not persecutors.\n   Without an exception for involuntary action, the Refu\u00ad\ngee Act\u2019s bar would similarly treat entire classes of victims\nas persecutors. The Act does not support such a reading.\nThe language of the persecutor bar is most naturally read\nto denote culpable conduct, and this reading is powerfully\nsupported by the statutory context and legislative history.\n   As this Court has previously recognized\u2014and as the\nmajority acknowledges again today\u2014Congress passed the\nRefugee Act to implement the United Nations Convention\nRelating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U. N. T. S. 150\n(July 28, 1951) (hereinafter Convention), reprinted in 19\nU. S. T. 6259, and the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relat\u00ad\ning to the Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, [1968] 19\nU. S. T. 6223, T. I. A. S. No. 6577 (hereinafter Protocol).\nThese treaties place a mandatory obligation on signatory\nstates not to \u201cexpel or return (\u2018refouler\u2019) a refugee in any\nmanner whatsoever to . . . territories where his life or\nfreedom would be threatened on account of his race, relig\u00ad\nion, nationality, membership of a particular social group\nor political opinion.\u201d Convention, Art. 33(1), 19 U. S. T., at\n6276; Protocol, Art. I, 19 U. S. T., at 6225. The Refugee\nAct\u2019s withholding of removal provision specifically tracks\nthis language. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71231(b)(3)(A); see H. R. Rep.\nNo. 96\u2013608, p. 18 (1979) (withholding of removal provision\n\u201cclearly reflects our legal obligations under international\nagreements,\u201d specifically Convention Article 33).6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Asylum and withholding of removal address concerns different from\n\nthose addressed by the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

S. T., at 6263. It is this\nexception that the persecutor bar reflects. See, e.g., H. R.\nRep. No. 96\u2013608, at 18 (persecutor bar encompasses \u201cex\u00ad\nceptions . . . provided in the Convention relating to aliens\nwho have themselves participated in persecution\u201d); H. R.\nConf. Rep. No. 96\u2013781, p. 20 (1980). The language of the\nConvention\u2019s exception is critical: We do not normally\nconvict individuals of crimes when their actions are co\u00ad\nerced or otherwise involuntary. Indeed, the United Na\u00ad\ntions Handbook, to which the Court has looked for guid\u00ad\nance in the past, states that all relevant factors, including\n\u201cmitigating circumstances,\u201d must be considered in deter\u00ad\nmining whether an alien\u2019s acts are of a \u201ccriminal nature\u201d\nas contemplated by Article 1(F). Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on\nProcedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status\n\u00b6\u00b6157, 162 (reedited Jan. 1992). Other states parties to\nthe Convention and Protocol likewise read the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s exception as limited to culpable conduct.7 When we\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and its\nimplementing regulations.

The\nCAT prohibits a state party from returning any person to a country\nwhere there is substantial reason to believe he might be tortured, but\nits definition of torture covers a narrower class of harms, imposed by a\nnarrower class of actors, than the asylum and witholding of removal\nprovisions. Most importantly, the CAT limits its definition of torture to\nacts \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquies\u00ad\ncence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity,\u201d\nPt. I, Art. 1, \u00b61, p. 19, while asylum and withholding of removal are\navailable to victims of harm inflicted by private actors, without regard\nto state involvement, see, e.g., In re Kasinga, 21 I. & N.

See Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co.,\n516 U. S. 217, 226\u2013228 (1996). Congress\u2019 effort to conform\nUnited States law to the standard set forth in the U. N.\nConvention and Protocol shows that it intended the perse\u00ad\ncutor bar to apply only to culpable, voluntary acts\u2014and it\nunderscores that Congress did not delegate the question\npresented by this case to the agency.\n   While I would hold that the persecutor bar does not\nautomatically disqualify from asylum or withholding of\nremoval an alien who acted involuntarily,8 I would leave\nfor the Attorney General\u2014and, through his own delega\u00ad\ntion, the BIA\u2014the question how the voluntariness stan\u00ad\ndard should be applied. The agency would retain the\nability, for instance, to define duress and coercion; to\ndetermine whether or not a balancing test should be em\u00ad\nployed; and, of course, to decide whether any individual\nasylum-seeker\u2019s acts were covered by the persecutor bar.\nThose are the sorts of questions suited to the agency\u2019s\nunique competencies in administering the INA. The\nthreshold question before the Court is not.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u00b6\u00b6108\u2013110 (U. K. Immigr. App. Trib.); SRYYY v.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 3, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\n   The \u201cpersecutor bar\u201d in the Immigration and National\u00ad\nity Act (INA) denies asylum and the withholding of re\u00ad\nmoval to any alien who has \u201cordered, incited, assisted, or\notherwise participated in the persecution of any person on\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a\nparticular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A), 1231(b)(3)(B)(i). The Board\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA), principally relying on this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U. S.\n490 (1981), held that the statute does not require that the\npersecution be voluntarily inflicted. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n   According to the Court, Fedorenko, which construed the\nsimilar text of a persecution bar in the Displaced Persons\nAct of 1948 (DPA), is largely irrelevant to the question\npresented here. See ante, at 6\u20138, 9\u201310; see also ante, at 2\n(SCALIA, J., concurring). The majority further holds that\nthe INA is ambiguous as to \u201cwhether coercion or duress is\nrelevant in determining if an alien assisted or otherwise\nparticipated in persecution\u201d and that the agency, there\u00ad\nfore, should interpret the statute in the first instance to\ndetermine whether it reasonably can be read to include a\nvoluntariness requirement. Ante, at 5, 10\u201312; see also\nante, at 1 (SCALIA, J., concurring). I disagree with both of\n2                   NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthese conclusions. Because the INA unambiguously pre\u00ad\ncludes any inquiry into whether the persecutor acted\nvoluntarily, i.e., free from coercion or duress, I would\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respectfully\ndissent.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Daniel Girmai Negusie testified to the Immi\u00ad\ngration Judge (IJ) that he was forced to work as an armed\nguard for four years at an Eritrean prison camp where\nprisoners were persecuted because of their religious be\u00ad\nliefs. According to petitioner, part of his job was \u201cto firmly\ncontrol the prisoners, to punish the prisoners, too, by\nexposing them\u201d to the extreme heat of the African sun.\nApp. 58. The guards \u201cwould . . . hold [a] stick [with] their\nhand\u201d and follow prisoners who were being forced to \u201croll\non the ground in the sun.\u201d Id., at 23. Because \u201cit was\nextremely hot,\u201d prisoners would quickly \u201cget tired and\n[feel] shortness of breath and stop\u201d rolling. Id., at 24.\nThey were then beaten. Prisoners typically could not\nsurvive this punishment for more than two hours. Indeed,\nat least one prisoner died from sun exposure while peti\u00ad\ntioner stood guard. See ante, at 3 (majority opinion).\n   Petitioner testified that, as a guard, he prevented the\nprisoners from showering and forbade them from leaving\ntheir rooms for fresh air. This form of punishment was\nparticularly severe because the prisons were \u201cbuilt from\nstone and bricks\u201d with \u201cno cooling system, no ventilation,\nno windows,\u201d and intolerable heat. App. 20, 30. Petitioner\nalso prevented prisoner escapes, for which the punishment\nwas forced sun exposure. And, although petitioner never\nused \u201celectricity to torture\u201d prisoners, he was aware that\nhis supervisor did. Id., at 61\u201362.\n   But petitioner, who had converted to Protestantism\nwhen he was confined as a prisoner at the camp, also\ntestified that he did not want to persecute any of the\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Thus, at times he disobeyed his\norders. On one occasion, he gave water to a prisoner who\nwas dying from sun exposure. On another occasion, he let\nfemale prisoners take showers after they had been denied\nthat privilege \u201cfor a long time.\u201d Id., at 37.

The BIA affirmed. In their view, petitioner\u2019s\nconduct objectively qualified as assistance or participation\nin the persecution of others based on religion. See ante, at\n3 (majority opinion). Relying on Fedorenko, the IJ and\nBIA found that even if petitioner was \u201ccompelled to par\u00ad\nticipate as a prison guard\u201d against his wishes, his \u201cmotiva\u00ad\ntion and intent are irrelevant to the issue of whether he\n\u2018assisted\u2019 in persecution.\u201d Ibid. (some internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Therefore, petitioner was ineligible for\nasylum or the withholding of removal under the INA. The\nIJ and BIA agreed, however, that petitioner qualified for\ndeferral of removal because it is \u201cmore likely than not that\nhe would be tortured\u201d if returned to Eritrea given that its\n\u201cgovernment has used deadly force and threatened to use\ndeadly force against deserters.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a\u2013\n8a, 20a, 19a.

See Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5) (citing Lamie v. United\nStates Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004)).

S.\n281, 291 (1988). As the majority acknowledges, see ante,\nat 5\u20136, the text of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar neither in\u00ad\ncludes the term \u201cvoluntary\u201d nor contains an exception for\ninvoluntary, coerced conduct. The statute instead applies\nto any alien \u201cwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\nparticipated in the persecution of any person\u201d on account\nof a protected ground. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(42), 1158(b)(2)(A)(i),\n1231(b)(3)(B)(i).\n  The statute\u2019s key terms also do not imply any voluntari\u00ad\nness requirement for persecution. Under the ordinary\nmeaning of the term \u201cpersecution\u201d at the time of the stat\u00ad\nute\u2019s enactment in 1980 and its reenactment in 1996, the\nact of persecution alone is sufficient to classify one\u2019s con\u00ad\nduct as persecution. See Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate\nDictionary 877 (1991) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s Ninth) (defin\u00ad\ning \u201cpersecution\u201d as \u201cthe act or practice of persecuting esp.\nthose who differ in origin, religion, or social outlook\u201d); see\nalso Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 855 (1975) (here\u00ad\ninafter Webster\u2019s) (same). The term itself includes no\nintrinsic mens rea requirement. As a result, an individual\ncan \u201cpersecute\u201d\u2014meaning \u201charass in a manner designed\nto injure, grieve, or afflict\u201d\u2014without having designed the\nact or intended for injury, grief, or affliction to occur.\nWebster\u2019s Ninth 877; see also Webster\u2019s 855 (same).\n  The persecutor bar\u2019s inclusion of those who \u201cassist\u201d or\n\u201cparticipate\u201d confirms that it does not include a voluntari\u00ad\nness requirement. The term \u201cassist\u201d is defined as \u201cto give\nsupport or aid,\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth 109, or \u201cto help,\u201d Oxford\nAmerican Dictionary 36 (1980) (hereinafter Oxford).

Accord\u00ad\ningly, this Court has concluded that the ordinary mean\u00ad\nings of \u201cassist\u201d and \u201cparticipate\u201d do not \u201cconnote volun\u00ad\ntariness.\u201d Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v.

Even if participation or assistance is\ncoerced, it remains participation or assistance just the\nsame.\n                             B\n  In addition to the particular statutory section of the INA\nbefore the Court, \u201cthe language and design of the statute\nas a whole\u201d is instructive in determining the provision\u2019s\nplain meaning. K mart Corp., supra, at 291; see also\nAmoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480 U. S. 531, 552\u2013553\n(1987). Here, the INA\u2019s design and structure buttress the\nconclusion that the persecutor bar applies irrespective of\nvoluntariness.\n  First, Congress has evidenced its ability to both specifi\u00ad\ncally require voluntary conduct and explicitly exclude\ninvoluntary conduct in other provisions of the INA. See\ninfra, at 15\u201316. For example, Congress has barred admis\u00ad\nsion to the United States of totalitarian party members\nunless their membership was \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d 8 U. S. C.\n8                   NEGUSIE v.

Sigmon Coal Co.,\n534 U. S. 438, 452\u2013454 (2002). The absence of a volun\u00ad\ntariness requirement in the INA persecutor bar is no\nexception.\n   Second, federal immigration law provides calibrated\nremedies, which include partial refuge for specified aliens\nwho have both suffered from and inflicted persecution.\nThose who have been persecuted and have not engaged in\npersecution may receive both asylum and the withholding\nof removal. \u00a7\u00a71231(b)(3)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A). Those at the\nother end of the spectrum, who have not been persecuted\nbut have persecuted others, may not receive either asylum\nor the withholding of removal. \u00a7\u00a71231(b)(3)(B)(i),\n1158(b)(2)(A)(i). And finally, for many individuals who\n(like petitioner) have both persecuted others and been\npersecuted, the scheme provides temporary refuge; they\nwill receive deferral of removal under the CAT if they will\nface torture upon their return to their home country. CAT\nPolicy (a), at 263; see also 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a71208.13(a),\n1208.16(d)(2).\n   Where \u201cCongress has enacted a comprehensive scheme\nand has deliberately targeted specific problems with spe\u00ad\ncific solutions,\u201d courts should not read one part of the\nlegislative regime (the INA) to provide a different, and\nconflicting, solution to a problem that has already been\nspecifically addressed elsewhere in the federal immigra\u00ad\ntion regime (regulations implementing the CAT). Varity\nCorp. v. Howe, 516 U. S. 489, 519 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Federal law provides\nonly partial protection to a victim of persecution who has\nalso engaged in persecution, voluntarily or not. There\nsimply is no justification for writing into the INA\u2019s perse\u00ad\ncutor bar the greater protections of asylum and the with\u00ad\nholding of removal for individuals who were coerced into\nengaging in persecution. That is, the \u201cassumption of\ninadvertent omission\u201d of a voluntariness requirement in\nthe INA \u201cis rendered especially suspect upon close consid\u00ad\neration of [a statute\u2019s] interlocking, interrelated, and\ninterdependent remedial scheme\u201d that addresses the\nspecific problem at issue in a conflicting way.

In fact, \u201cover no conceivable subject is the legislative power of\nCongress more complete than it is over\u201d the decision of Congress to\nadmit or to exclude aliens. Oceanic Steam Nav. Co. v. Stranahan, 214\nU. S. 320, 339 (1909). Courts therefore must enforce the immigration\npolicy decision reflected in a statute\u2019s plain terms, even if Congress has\nchosen \u201cto forbid the entrance of foreigners within its dominions\u201d\naltogether, Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.

HOLDER\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ned. 2008). Here, the statutory and decisional backdrop\nagainst which Congress enacted the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\ncounsels against grafting a voluntariness requirement\nonto the statute.\n   When Congress enacted the INA\u2019s persecutor bar, it\nessentially retained the language used in similar prede\u00ad\ncessor statutes. Under the 1948 DPA persecutor bar,\nentry was denied to all who \u201c \u2018assisted the enemy in perse\u00ad\ncuting civil[ians].\u2019 \u201d Fedorenko, 449 U. S., at 495 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3051). In 1950, Congress added a second persecu\u00ad\ntor bar to the DPA that applied \u201cto any person who advo\u00ad\ncated or assisted in the persecution of any person because\nof race, religion, or national origin.\u201d \u00a713, 64 Stat. 227. In\nthe years that followed, Congress continued to use this\nsame broad language in denying asylum to specific catego\u00ad\nries of persecutors. See, e.g., \u00a7105, 91 Stat. 1224 (denying\npermanent residence to aliens from Vietnam, Laos, and\nCambodia \u201cwho ordered, assisted, or otherwise partici\u00ad\npated in the persecution of any person because of race,\nreligion, or political opinion\u201d); 8 U.

This stat\u00ad\nute comprehensively labeled as a persecutor \u201cany person\nwho ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in\nthe persecution of any person on account of race, religion,\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or\npolitical opinion.\u201d \u00a7201(a), 94 Stat. 102\u2013103.

By the time of the 1996 reen\u00ad\nactment, this Court had specifically interpreted the plain\nlanguage of the predecessor bars to apply regardless of the\nvoluntariness of a persecutor\u2019s conduct. See Fedorenko,\nsupra, at 512 (1948 DPA bar); see also United States v.\nKoreh, 59 F. 3d 431, 439 (CA3 1995) (1950 DPA bar);\nUnited States v.

This Court must assume, absent textual proof to the\ncontrary, that Congress was aware of the Fedorenko deci\u00ad\nsion when it reenacted the persecutor bar and thus\n\u201cadopt[ed] that interpretation when it re-enact[ed the]\nstatute without change,\u201d Lorillard, supra, at 580.\n                           D\n  In sum, the INA\u2019s persecutor bar does not require that\n12                       NEGUSIE v.

It also is undisputed that petitioner\ncarried out the persecution by preventing prisoners from\nescaping and by standing guard while at least one pris\u00ad\noner died from sun exposure. Ibid. Petitioner, therefore,\n\u201cassisted, or otherwise participated\u201d in persecution and\nthus is statutorily disqualified from receiving asylum or\nwithholding of removal under the INA. 3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE STEVENS also finds the language of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar\n\u201cplain,\u201d but concludes that it must incorporate a culpability require\u00ad\nment because the statute applies to those whose \u201cacts are of a \u2018criminal\nnature.\u2019 \u201d See ante, at 7, 9 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). I disagree. The decision to admit an alien is a matter of legisla\u00ad\ntive grace, see n. 2, supra, for which judicial review has been \u201cconsis\u00ad\ntently classified\u201d as civil in nature, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342\nU. S. 580, 594 (1952); see also Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678, 720\n(2001) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (explaining that \u201c \u2018an alien seeking\ninitial admission to the United States requests a privilege and has no\nconstitutional rights regarding his application, for the power to admit\nor exclude aliens is a sovereign prerogative\u2019 \u201d (quoting Landon v.\nPlasencia, 459 U.

Further, the conclusory\npronouncement in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\nfor Refugees\u2019 Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining\nRefugee Status \u00b6162 (reedited Jan. 1992), that \u201cit has to be assumed,\nalthough this is not specifically stated, that the acts covered by the\npresent clause must also be of a criminal nature,\u201d is insufficient to\nrequire criminal proof to deny withholding of removal, contra, ante, at\n                   Cite as: 555 U.

INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 329 (2001) (SCALIA,\nJ., dissenting).\n   The majority principally finds ambiguity in the statu\u00ad\ntory text because it does not include either the word \u201cvol\u00ad\nuntary\u201d or the word \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d See ante, at 7. But a\nstatute cannot be deemed ambiguous until the court \u201cex\u00ad\nhaust[s] the aid of the \u2018traditional tools of statutory con\u00ad\nstruction\u2019 \u201d and determines that Congress did not resolve\nthe issue under consideration. Clark v. Martinez, 543\nU. S. 371, 402 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting\nChevron, 467 U. S., at 843, n. 9). Deeming a statute with\nbroad terms to be ambiguous for that reason alone essen\u00ad\ntially requires Congress either to obey a judicially imposed\nclear-statement rule or accept the risk that the courts may\nrefuse to give full effect to a statute\u2019s plain meaning in the\nname of Chevron deference. Not every difficult question of\nstatutory construction amounts to a statutory gap for a\nfederal agency to fill. See ante, at 1\u20134 (opinion of\nSTEVENS, J.). And the Court should not, \u201cin the name of\ndeference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a stat\u00ad\nute\u201d simply because it requires some effort. Global Cross\ning Telecommunications, Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommu\nnications, Inc., 550 U.

HOLDER\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n    The majority makes no attempt to apply the \u201ctraditional\ntools of statutory construction\u201d to the persecutor bar be\u00ad\nfore retreating to ambiguity. See ante, at 5\u20136. Rather, it\nmerely observes that Congress could have spoken more\ndirectly to the issue, which it finds sufficient to render the\nstatute ambiguous on this score. Ante, at 6. But the\nabsence of a phrase specifying that the provision applies to\nboth involuntary and voluntary conduct is not definitive\nproof of ambiguity. It is certainly correct that Congress\n\u201c \u2018could have spoken in clearer terms,\u2019 \u201d Clark, 543 U. S., at\n402 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), as it almost always can in\nany statute. However, this \u201cproves nothing\u201d in evaluating\nwhether the statute is ambiguous. Ibid. The question\nbefore the Court instead is whether Congress has provided\nan unambiguous answer in the plain language that it\nchose to use. Here, for the reasons just explained, the\ntraditional tools of statutory interpretation show with\n\u201cutmost clarity,\u201d St. Cyr, supra, at 329, that the statute\napplies regardless of the voluntariness of the alien who\nparticipates or assists in persecution.4\n    The majority also finds ambiguity based on differences\nbetween the INA and the DPA statutory bar considered in\nFedorenko. In particular, the majority points to the Fe\ndorenko Court\u2019s reliance on a second part of the DPA\npersecutor bar, which applied to those who \u201c \u2018voluntarily\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Because this Court should not delegate the interpretation of the\n\npersecutor bar\u2019s plain meaning to a federal agency, see Board of Gover\nnors, FRS v. Dimension Financial Corp., 474 U. S. 361, 368 (1986), it is\nlargely irrelevant whether the BIA properly relied on Fedorenko v.\nUnited States, 449 U. S. 490 (1981), in interpreting the statute, see\nante, at 9\u201311 (majority opinion); ante, at 2 (SCALIA, J., concurring). In\nany event, the BIA\u2019s construction of the INA\u2019s persecutor bar correctly\nreflected the text of the provision. There is no reason to remand the\nquestion to the agency when only one construction of the statute is\npermissible and the agency\u2019s original decision adopted that proper\nconstruction. See National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 982\u2013985 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S., at 495, and n. 3 (quoting\n62 Stat. 3052; emphasis added). The Court noted that\n\u201c[u]nder traditional principles of statutory construction,\nthe deliberate omission of the word \u2018voluntary\u2019 from \u00a72(a),\u201d\nwhich addressed the assistance of persecution\u2014but not\nfrom \u00a72(b)\u2014\u201ccompel[led] the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.\u201d Id., at 512. According to the major\u00ad\nity, because the INA persecutor bar, unlike the DPA bar,\ndoes not include a provision limited by the word \u201cvoluntar\u00ad\nily\u201d adjacent to the provision that is not so limited, the\nabsence of the adverb here cannot carry the significance\ngiven it in Fedorenko. See ante, at 7.\n   The majority\u2019s reasoning is flawed. The mere fact that\nthe INA\u2019s persecutor bar is not accompanied by a\nneighboring provision containing the word \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\ndoes not negate the significance of the term\u2019s absence\nwhen other INA provisions are explicitly limited to actions\nundertaken voluntarily. As noted above, see supra, at 7,\nthe INA imposes a voluntariness requirement in a host of\nstatutory provisions, see, e.g., 8 U. S. C. \u00a71158(c)(2)(D)\n(terminating asylum when alien has \u201cvoluntarily\u201d availed\nhimself     of    the    protection    of    his   country);\n\u00a7\u00a71182(a)(3)(D)(i)\u2013(ii) (denying admission and naturaliza\u00ad\ntion to those who have been members of, or affiliated with,\n\u201cthe Communist or any other totalitarian party\u201d unless\nthat membership or affiliation was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d);\n\u00a71182(d)(3)(B)(i) (denying admission to those who have\n\u201cvoluntarily and knowingly\u201d engaged in, endorsed, es\u00ad\npoused, or persuaded others to endorse, espouse, or sup\u00ad\nport terrorist activity); \u00a71229c(a)(1) (allowing an alien to\n\u201cvoluntarily\u201d depart the United States); \u00a7\u00a71424(a), (d)\n(precluding naturalization for members of certain totali\u00ad\ntarian parties, unless membership was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d);\n\u00a71481(a) (providing for loss of nationality by \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\n16                      NEGUSIE v. HOLDER\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nperforming certain specified acts with the intention of\nrelinquishing nationality).5\n  In the immigration and naturalization context, then,\nCongress is certainly capable of declaring its preference\nfor a voluntariness requirement. That Congress\u2019 explicit\nreferences to voluntariness appear in other sections of this\nparticular statutory scheme, rather than in subsections of\n\u00a7\u00a71158 or 1231, is immaterial. Cf. Rusello, 464 U. S., at\n23; Barnhart, 534 U. S., at 452\u2013454. And the fact that\nCongress, in the course of making structural revisions to\nthe statutory regime, eliminated the specific dichotomy\nthe Court noted in Fedorenko does not undermine the\ncritical point: The INA expressly includes a voluntariness\nrequirement in several places but does not impose such a\nrequirement in the persecution bar. Thus, the omission of\nthe word \u201cvoluntarily\u201d from the persecutor bar in the INA\nis just as conclusive as its omission from the persecutor\nbar in the DPA. With respect to both statutes, the delib\u00ad\nerate omission \u201ccompels the conclusion that the statute\nmade all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians\nineligible for visas.\u201d 449 U. S., at 512.\n  Finally, the majority concludes that the DPA bar is\ndistinguishable from the INA bar because the former was\nenacted in the context of the \u201c \u2018 \u201ccrime against humanity\nthat [was] involved in the concentration camp,\u201d \u2019 \u201d which\nwas so horrific that it is in a category all its own. Ante, at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Moreover,  in the Refugee Act of 1980, which added the persecutor\nbar to the INA, Congress separately codified its desire to \u201cpromote\nopportunities for resettlement or voluntary repatriation.\u201d \u00a7101(a), 94\nStat. 102, note following 8 U. S. C. \u00a71521. In 1996, when Congress\nreenacted the statutory text, it retained the persecution bar\u2019s broad\nlanguage while again restricting other sections to voluntary conduct.\nSee IIRIRA, \u00a7304, 110 Stat. 3009\u2013587 (relating to \u201cvoluntary depar\u00ad\nture\u201d), \u00a7402, id., at 3009\u2013656 (relating to \u201cvoluntary\u201d participation in\npilot programs for confirming employment eligibility), \u00a7604, id., at\n3009\u2013690 (providing for termination of asylum when alien \u201cvoluntarily\u201d\ntakes certain actions).\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n8 (quoting Fedorenko, supra, at 511, n. 32). In that unique\ncontext, the majority reasons, it made sense to exclude\n\u201ceven those involved in nonculpable, involuntary assis\u00ad\ntance in Nazi persecution.\u201d Ibid. But the majority cannot\nintend to suggest that all acts of persecution during the\nSecond World War were inherently more depraved or\nreprehensible than all acts of persecution that have oc\u00ad\ncurred in the decades since the INA\u2019s enactment.\n   Certainly, no such conclusion is compelled by the statu\u00ad\ntory text. Congress has steadfastly condemned all acts of\npersecution. See 22 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a76401(a)(5)\u2013(7) (noting that\n\u201cCongress has recognized and denounced acts of religious\npersecution,\u201d which can be \u201csevere and violent\u201d and \u201cpar\u00ad\nticularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under to\u00ad\ntalitarian governments and in countries with militant\npoliticized religious majorities\u201d); \u00a76401(b)(5) (announcing\nthat it is the \u201cpolicy of the United States\u201d to \u201cstan[d] with\nthe persecuted\u201d); \u00a7501, 78 Stat. 1015 (\u201cThe Congress con\u00ad\ndemns the persecution of any persons because of their\nreligion\u201d); Refugee Act of 1980, \u00a7101(a), 94 Stat. 102 (\u201cThe\nCongress declares that it is the historic policy of the\nUnited States to respond to the urgent needs of persons\nsubject to persecution in their homelands\u201d). There is no\nreason to deny the INA persecutor bar its full meaning\nbased on a speculative assumption that Congress, in 1980,\ncould not have meant to oppose persecution quite as in\u00ad\ntensely as it did in the aftermath of World War II. Rather,\nthe INA\u2019s persecutor bar naturally extends to all acts of\npersecution and, therefore, requires the denial of asylum\nand withholding of removal for \u201ceven those involved in\nnonculpable, involuntary assistance in . . . persecution.\u201d\nAnte, at 8 (majority opinion).\n                           IV\n Because I conclude that the INA\u2019s persecutor bar applies\nwhether or not petitioner\u2019s assistance or participation in\n18                 NEGUSIE v.
