SUMMUM\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 07\u2013665.      Argued November 12, 2008\u2014Decided February 25, 2009\nPioneer Park (Park), a public park in petitioner Pleasant Grove City\n  (City), has at least 11 permanent, privately donated displays, includ\n  ing a Ten Commandments monument. In rejecting the request of re\n  spondent Summum, a religious organization, to erect a monument\n  containing the Seven Aphorisms of Summum, the City explained that\n  it limited Park monuments to those either directly related to the\n  City\u2019s history or donated by groups with longstanding community\n  ties. After the City put that policy and other criteria into writing, re\n  spondent renewed its request, but did not describe the monument\u2019s\n  historical significance or respondent\u2019s connection to the community.\n  The City rejected the request, and respondent filed suit, claiming\n  that the City and petitioner officials had violated the First Amend\n  ment\u2019s Free Speech Clause by accepting the Ten Commandments\n  monument but rejecting respondent\u2019s proposed monument. The Dis\n  trict Court denied respondent\u2019s preliminary injunction request, but\n  the Tenth Circuit reversed. Noting that it had previously found the\n  Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than govern\n  ment speech and that public parks have traditionally been regarded\n  as public forums, the court held that, because the exclusion of the\n  monument was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny, the City was re\n  quired to erect it immediately.\nHeld: The placement of a permanent monument in a public park is a\n form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny\n under the Free Speech Clause. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Because that Clause restricts government regulation of private\n speech but not government speech, whether petitioners were engag\n ing in their own expressive conduct or providing a forum for private\n speech determines which precedents govern here. Pp. 4\u20137.\n2                 PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n         (1) A government entity \u201cis entitled to say what it wishes,\u201d\n    Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 833,\n    and to select the views that it wants to express, see, e.g., Rust v. Sul\n    livan, 500 U. S. 173, 194. It may exercise this same freedom when it\n    receives private assistance for the purpose of delivering a govern\n    ment-controlled message. See Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn.,\n    544 U. S. 550, 562. This does not mean that there are no restraints\n    on government speech. For example, government speech must com\n    port with the Establishment Clause. In addition, public officials\u2019 in\n    volvement in advocacy may be limited by law, regulation, or practice;\n    and a government entity is ultimately \u201caccountable to the electorate\n    and the political process for its advocacy,\u201d Board of Regents of Univ.\n    of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 235. Pp. 4\u20136.\n         (2) In contrast, government entities are strictly limited in their\n    ability to regulate private speech in \u201ctraditional public fora.\u201d Corne\n    lius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800.\n    Reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions are allowed, see\n    Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45, but\n    content-based restrictions must satisfy strict scrutiny, i.e., they must\n    be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, see\n    Cornelius, supra, at 800. Restrictions based on viewpoint are also\n    prohibited. Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 463. Government restric\n    tions on speech in a \u201cdesignated public forum\u201d are subject to the same\n    strict scrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum. Corne\n    lius, supra, at 800. And where government creates a forum that is\n    limited to use by certain groups or dedicated to the discussion of cer\n    tain subjects, Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, n. 7, it may impose rea\n    sonable and viewpoint-neutral restrictions, see Good News Club v.\n    Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\u2013107. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Permanent monuments displayed on public property typically\n    represent government speech. Governments have long used monu\n    ments to speak to the public. Thus, a government-commissioned and\n    government-financed monument placed on public land constitutes\n    government speech. So, too, are privately financed and donated\n    monuments that the government accepts for public display on gov\n    ernment land. While government entities regularly accept privately\n    funded or donated monuments, their general practice has been one of\n    selective receptivity. Because city parks play an important role in de\n    fining the identity that a city projects to its residents and the outside\n    world, cities take care in accepting donated monuments, selecting\n    those that portray what the government decisionmakers view as ap\n    propriate for the place in question, based on esthetics, history, and\n    local culture. The accepted monuments are meant to convey and\n    have the effect of conveying a government message and thus consti\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

Pp. 7\u201310.\n     (c) Here, the Park\u2019s monuments clearly represent government\n  speech. Although many were donated in completed form by private\n  entities, the City has \u201ceffectively controlled\u201d their messages by exer\n  cising \u201cfinal approval authority\u201d over their selection. Johanns, supra,\n  at 560\u2013561. The City has selected monuments that present the im\n  age that the City wishes to project to Park visitors; it has taken own\n  ership of most of the monuments in the Park, including the Ten Com\n  mandments monument; and it has now expressly set out selection\n  criteria. P. 10.\n     (d) Respondent\u2019s legitimate concern that the government speech\n  doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain viewpoints\n  does not mean that a government entity should be required to em\n  brace publicly a privately donated monument\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d in order to\n  escape Free Speech Clause restrictions. A city engages in expressive\n  conduct by accepting and displaying a privately donated monument,\n  but it does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any par\n  ticular donor sees in the monument. A government\u2019s message may be\n  altered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in the same\n  vicinity. It may also change over time. Pp. 10\u201315.\n     (e) \u201c[P]ublic forum principles . . . are out of place in the context of\n  this case.\u201d United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S.\n  194, 205. The forum doctrine applies where a government property\n  or program is capable of accommodating a large number of public\n  speakers without defeating the essential function of the land or pro\n  gram, but public parks can accommodate only a limited number of\n  permanent monuments. If governments must maintain viewpoint\n  neutrality in selecting donated monuments, they must either prepare\n  for cluttered parks or face pressure to remove longstanding and cher\n  ished monuments. Were public parks considered traditional public\n  forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments,\n  most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations.\n  And if forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to closing of the\n  forum, forum analysis is out of place.

SUMMUM\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 25, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case presents the question whether the Free\nSpeech Clause of the First Amendment entitles a private\ngroup to insist that a municipality permit it to place a\npermanent monument in a city park in which other do\nnated monuments were previously erected. The Court of\nAppeals held that the municipality was required to accept\nthe monument because a public park is a traditional pub\nlic forum. We conclude, however, that although a park is a\ntraditional public forum for speeches and other transitory\nexpressive acts, the display of a permanent monument in\na public park is not a form of expression to which forum\nanalysis applies. Instead, the placement of a permanent\nmonument in a public park is best viewed as a form of\ngovernment speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny\nunder the Free Speech Clause.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Pioneer Park (or Park) is a 2.5 acre public park located\nin the Historic District of Pleasant Grove City (or City) in\nUtah. The Park currently contains 15 permanent dis\n2                PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nplays, at least 11 of which were donated by private groups\nor individuals. These include an historic granary, a wish\ning well, the City\u2019s first fire station, a September 11\nmonument, and a Ten Commandments monument do\nnated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in 1971.\n  Respondent Summum is a religious organization\nfounded in 1975 and headquartered in Salt Lake City,\nUtah. On two separate occasions in 2003, Summum\u2019s\npresident wrote a letter to the City\u2019s mayor requesting\npermission to erect a \u201cstone monument,\u201d which would\ncontain \u201cthe Seven Aphorisms of SUMMUM\u201d1 and be\nsimilar in size and nature to the Ten Commandments\nmonument. App. 57, 59. The City denied the requests\nand explained that its practice was to limit monuments in\nthe Park to those that \u201ceither (1) directly relate to the\nhistory of Pleasant Grove, or (2) were donated by groups\nwith longstanding ties to the Pleasant Grove community.\u201d\nId., at 61. The following year, the City passed a resolution\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Respondent\u2019s\n                 brief describes the church and the Seven Aphorisms as\nfollows:\n   \u201cThe Summum church incorporates elements of Gnostic Christianity,\nteaching that spiritual knowledge is experiential and that through\ndevotion comes revelation, which \u2018modifies human perceptions, and\ntransfigures the individual.\u2019 See The Teachings of Summum are the\nTeachings of Gnostic Christianity, http://www.summum.us/philosophy/\ngnosticism.shtml (visited Aug. 15, 2008).\n   \u201cCentral to Summum religious belief and practice are the Seven\nPrinciples of Creation (the \u201cSeven Aphorisms\u201d). According to Summum\ndoctrine, the Seven Aphorisms were inscribed on the original tablets\nhanded down by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. . . . Because Moses\nbelieved that the Israelites were not ready to receive the Aphorisms, he\nshared them only with a select group of people. In the Summum\nExodus account, Moses then destroyed the original tablets, traveled\nback to Mount Sinai, and returned with a second set of tablets con\ntaining the Ten Commandments. See The Aphorisms of Summum\nand the Ten Commandments, http://www.summum.us/philosophy/\ntencommandments.shtml (visited Aug. 15, 2008).\u201d Brief for Respondent\n1\u20132.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nputting this policy into writing. The resolution also men\ntioned other criteria, such as safety and esthetics.\n   In May 2005, respondent\u2019s president again wrote to the\nmayor asking to erect a monument, but the letter did not\ndescribe the monument, its historical significance, or\nSummum\u2019s connection to the community. The city council\nrejected this request.\n                             B\n  In 2005, respondent filed this action against the City\nand various local officials (petitioners), asserting, among\nother claims, that petitioners had violated the Free Speech\nClause of the First Amendment by accepting the Ten\nCommandments monument but rejecting the proposed\nSeven Aphorisms monument. Respondent sought a pre\nliminary injunction directing the City to permit Summum\nto erect its monument in Pioneer Park. After the District\nCourt denied Summum\u2019s preliminary injunction request,\nNo. 2:05CV00638, 2006 WL 3421838 (D Utah, Nov. 22,\n2006), respondent appealed, pressing solely its free speech\nclaim.\n  A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. 483 F. 3d 1044\n(2007). The panel noted that it had previously found the\nTen Commandments monument to be private rather than\ngovernment speech. See Summum v. Ogden, 297 F. 3d\n995 (2002). Noting that public parks have traditionally\nbeen regarded as public forums, the panel held that the\nCity could not reject the Seven Aphorisms monument\nunless it had a compelling justification that could not be\nserved by more narrowly tailored means. See 483 F. 3d, at\n1054. The panel then concluded that the exclusion of\nrespondent\u2019s monument was unlikely to survive this strict\nscrutiny, and the panel therefore held that the City was\nrequired to erect Summum\u2019s monument immediately.\n  The Tenth Circuit denied the City\u2019s petition for rehear\ning en banc by an equally divided vote. 499 F. 3d 1170\n4           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2007). Judge Lucero dissented, arguing that the Park\nwas not a traditional public forum for the purpose of dis\nplaying monuments. Id., at 1171. Judge McConnell also\ndissented, contending that the monuments in the Park\nconstitute government speech. Id., at 1174.\n  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   No prior decision of this Court has addressed the appli\ncation of the Free Speech Clause to a government entity\u2019s\nacceptance of privately donated, permanent monuments\nfor installation in a public park, and the parties disagree\nsharply about the line of precedents that governs this\nsituation. Petitioners contend that the pertinent cases are\nthose concerning government speech. Respondent, on the\nother hand, agrees with the Court of Appeals panel that\nthe applicable cases are those that analyze private speech\nin a public forum. The parties\u2019 fundamental disagreement\nthus centers on the nature of petitioners\u2019 conduct when\nthey permitted privately donated monuments to be erected\nin Pioneer Park. Were petitioners engaging in their own\nexpressive conduct? Or were they providing a forum for\nprivate speech?\n                             A\n   If petitioners were engaging in their own expressive\nconduct, then the Free Speech Clause has no application.\nThe Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation\nof private speech; it does not regulate government speech.\nSee Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550,\n553 (2005) (\u201c[T]he Government\u2019s own speech . . . is exempt\nfrom First Amendment scrutiny\u201d); Columbia Broadcasting\nSystem, Inc. v.

S. 569, 598 (1998) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cIt is the very business of government to favor\nand disfavor points of view\u201d).\n   Indeed, it is not easy to imagine how government could\nfunction if it lacked this freedom. \u201cIf every citizen were to\nhave a right to insist that no one paid by public funds\nexpress a view with which he disagreed, debate over is\nsues of great concern to the public would be limited to\nthose in the private sector, and the process of government\nas we know it radically transformed.\u201d Keller v. State Bar\nof Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 12\u201313 (1990). See also Johanns, 544\nU. S., at 574 (SOUTER, J., dissenting) (\u201cTo govern, govern\nment has to say something, and a First Amendment heck\nler\u2019s veto of any forced contribution to raising the govern\nment\u2019s voice in the \u2018marketplace of ideas\u2019 would be out of\nthe question\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n   A government entity may exercise this same freedom to\nexpress its views when it receives assistance from private\nsources for the purpose of delivering a government\ncontrolled message. See id., at 562 (opinion of the Court)\n(where the government controls the message, \u201cit is not\nprecluded from relying on the government-speech doctrine\nmerely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmen\ntal sources\u201d); Rosenberger, supra, at 833 (a government\nentity may \u201cregulate the content of what is or is not ex\npressed . . . when it enlists private entities to convey its\nown message\u201d).\n   This does not mean that there are no restraints on\ngovernment speech. For example, government speech\n6            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmust comport with the Establishment Clause. The in\nvolvement of public officials in advocacy may be limited by\nlaw, regulation, or practice. And of course, a government\nentity is ultimately \u201caccountable to the electorate and the\npolitical process for its advocacy.\u201d Southworth, 529 U. S.,\nat 235. \u201cIf the citizenry objects, newly elected officials\nlater could espouse some different or contrary position.\u201d\nIbid.\n                               B\n  While government speech is not restricted by the Free\nSpeech Clause, the government does not have a free hand\nto regulate private speech on government property. This\nCourt long ago recognized that members of the public\nretain strong free speech rights when they venture into\npublic streets and parks, \u201cwhich \u2018have immemorially been\nheld in trust for the use of the public and, time out of\nmind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communi\ncating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public\nquestions.\u2019 \u201d Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019\nAssn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983) (quoting Hague v. Committee\nfor Industrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515 (1939)\n(opinion of Roberts, J.)). In order to preserve this freedom,\ngovernment entities are strictly limited in their ability to\nregulate private speech in such \u201ctraditional public fora.\u201d\nCornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473\nU. S. 788, 800 (1985). Reasonable time, place, and man\nner restrictions are allowed, see Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at\n45, but any restriction based on the content of the speech\nmust satisfy strict scrutiny, that is, the restriction must be\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government inter\nest, see Cornelius, supra, at 800, and restrictions based on\nviewpoint are prohibited, see Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S.\n455, 463 (1980).\n  With the concept of the traditional public forum as a\nstarting point, this Court has recognized that members of\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe public have free speech rights on other types of gov\nernment property and in certain other government pro\ngrams that share essential attributes of a traditional\npublic forum. We have held that a government entity may\ncreate \u201ca designated public forum\u201d if government property\nthat has not traditionally been regarded as a public forum\nis intentionally opened up for that purpose. See Cornelius,\n473 U. S., at 802. Government restrictions on speech in a\ndesignated public forum are subject to the same strict\nscrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum. Id.,\nat 800.\n   The Court has also held that a government entity may\ncreate a forum that is limited to use by certain groups or\ndedicated solely to the discussion of certain subjects.\nPerry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, n. 7. In such a forum, a\ngovernment entity may impose restrictions on speech that\nare reasonable and viewpoint-neutral. See Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\u2013107\n(2001).\n                             III\n  There may be situations in which it is difficult to tell\nwhether a government entity is speaking on its own behalf\nor is providing a forum for private speech, but this case\ndoes not present such a situation. Permanent monuments\ndisplayed on public property typically represent govern\nment speech.\n  Governments have long used monuments to speak to the\npublic. Since ancient times, kings, emperors, and other\nrulers have erected statues of themselves to remind their\nsubjects of their authority and power. Triumphal arches,\ncolumns, and other monuments have been built to com\nmemorate military victories and sacrifices and other\nevents of civic importance. A monument, by definition, is\na structure that is designed as a means of expression.\nWhen a government entity arranges for the construction of\n8           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na monument, it does so because it wishes to convey some\nthought or instill some feeling in those who see the struc\nture. Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondent dis\nputes the obvious proposition that a monument that is\ncommissioned and financed by a government body for\nplacement on public land constitutes government speech.\n   Just as government-commissioned and government\nfinanced monuments speak for the government, so do\nprivately financed and donated monuments that the gov\nernment accepts and displays to the public on government\nland. It certainly is not common for property owners to\nopen up their property for the installation of permanent\nmonuments that convey a message with which they do not\nwish to be associated. And because property owners typi\ncally do not permit the construction of such monuments on\ntheir land, persons who observe donated monuments\nroutinely\u2014and reasonably\u2014interpret them as conveying\nsome message on the property owner\u2019s behalf. In this\ncontext, there is little chance that observers will fail to\nappreciate the identity of the speaker. This is true\nwhether the monument is located on private property or\non public property, such as national, state, or city park\nland.\n   We think it is fair to say that throughout our Nation\u2019s\nhistory, the general government practice with respect to\ndonated monuments has been one of selective receptivity.\nA great many of the monuments that adorn the Nation\u2019s\npublic parks were financed with private funds or donated\nby private parties. Sites managed by the National Park\nService contain thousands of privately designed or funded\ncommemorative objects, including the Statue of Liberty,\nthe Marine Corps War Memorial (the Iwo Jima monu\nment), and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. States and\ncities likewise have received thousands of donated monu\nments. See, e.g., App. to Brief for International Municipal\nLawyers Association as Amicus Curiae 15a\u201329a (hereinaf\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nter IMLA Brief) (listing examples); Brief for American\nLegion et al. as Amici Curiae 7, and n. 2 (same). By ac\ncepting monuments that are privately funded or donated,\ngovernment entities save tax dollars and are able to ac\nquire monuments that they could not have afforded to\nfund on their own.\n   But while government entities regularly accept pri\nvately funded or donated monuments, they have exercised\nselectivity. An example discussed by the city of New York\nas amicus curiae is illustrative. In the wake of the contro\nversy generated in 1876 when the city turned down a\ndonated monument to honor Daniel Webster, the city\nadopted rules governing the acceptance of artwork for\npermanent placement in city parks, requiring, among\nother things, that \u201cany proposed gift of art had to be\nviewed either in its finished condition or as a model before\nacceptance.\u201d Brief for City of New York as Amicus Curiae\n4\u20135 (hereinafter NYC Brief). Across the country, \u201cmunici\npalities generally exercise editorial control over donated\nmonuments through prior submission requirements,\ndesign input, requested modifications, written criteria,\nand legislative approvals of specific content proposals.\u201d\nIMLA Brief 21.\n   Public parks are often closely identified in the public\nmind with the government unit that owns the land. City\nparks\u2014ranging from those in small towns, like Pioneer\nPark in Pleasant Grove City, to those in major metropo\nlises, like Central Park in New York City\u2014commonly play\nan important role in defining the identity that a city pro\njects to its own residents and to the outside world. Accord\ningly, cities and other jurisdictions take some care in\naccepting donated monuments. Government decisionmak\ners select the monuments that portray what they view as\nappropriate for the place in question, taking into account\nsuch content-based factors as esthetics, history, and local\nculture. The monuments that are accepted, therefore, are\n10          PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmeant to convey and have the effect of conveying a gov\nernment message, and they thus constitute government\nspeech.\n                                IV\n                                 A\n   In this case, it is clear that the monuments in Pleasant\nGrove\u2019s Pioneer Park represent government speech. Al\nthough many of the monuments were not designed or built\nby the City and were donated in completed form by private\nentities, the City decided to accept those donations and to\ndisplay them in the Park. Respondent does not claim that\nthe City ever opened up the Park for the placement of\nwhatever permanent monuments might be offered by\nprivate donors. Rather, the City has \u201ceffectively con\ntrolled\u201d the messages sent by the monuments in the Park\nby exercising \u201cfinal approval authority\u201d over their selec\ntion. Johanns, 544 U. S., at 560\u2013561. The City has se\nlected those monuments that it wants to display for the\npurpose of presenting the image of the City that it wishes\nto project to all who frequent the Park; it has taken own\nership of most of the monuments in the Park, including\nthe Ten Commandments monument that is the focus of\nrespondent\u2019s concern; and the City has now expressly set\nforth the criteria it will use in making future selections.\n                            B\n   Respondent voices the legitimate concern that the gov\nernment speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for\nfavoring certain private speakers over others based on\nviewpoint. Respondent\u2019s suggested solution is to require a\ngovernment entity accepting a privately donated monu\nment to go through a formal process of adopting a resolu\ntion publicly embracing \u201cthe message\u201d that the monument\nconveys. See Brief for Respondent 33\u201334, 57.\n   We see no reason for imposing a requirement of this\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsort. The parks of this country contain thousands of do\nnated monuments that government entities have used for\ntheir own expressive purposes, usually without producing\nthe sort of formal documentation that respondent now\nsays is required to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions.\nRequiring all of these jurisdictions to go back and proclaim\nformally that they adopt all of these monuments as their\nown expressive vehicles would be a pointless exercise that\nthe Constitution does not mandate.\n   In this case, for example, although respondent argues\nthat Pleasant Grove City has not adequately \u201ccontroll[ed]\nthe message,\u201d id., at 31, of the Ten Commandments monu\nment, the City took ownership of that monument and put\nit on permanent display in a park that it owns and man\nages and that is linked to the City\u2019s identity. All rights\npreviously possessed by the monument\u2019s donor have been\nrelinquished. The City\u2019s actions provided a more dramatic\nform of adoption than the sort of formal endorsement that\nrespondent would demand, unmistakably signifying to all\nPark visitors that the City intends the monument to speak\non its behalf. And the City has made no effort to abridge\nthe traditional free speech rights\u2014the right to speak,\ndistribute leaflets, etc.\u2014that may be exercised by respon\ndent and others in Pioneer Park.\n   What respondent demands, however, is that the City\n\u201cadopt\u201d or \u201cembrace\u201d \u201cthe message\u201d that it associates with\nthe monument. Id., at 33\u201334, 57. Respondent seems to\nthink that a monument can convey only one \u201cmessage\u201d\u2014\nwhich is, presumably, the message intended by the do\nnor\u2014and that, if a government entity that accepts a\nmonument for placement on its property does not formally\nembrace that message, then the government has not en\ngaged in expressive conduct.\n   This argument fundamentally misunderstands the way\nmonuments convey meaning. The meaning conveyed by a\nmonument is generally not a simple one like \u201c \u2018Beef. It\u2019s\n12              PLEASANT GROVE CITY v.

Even when\na monument features the written word, the monument\nmay be intended to be interpreted, and may in fact be\ninterpreted by different observers, in a variety of ways.\nMonuments called to our attention by the briefing in this\ncase illustrate this phenomenon.\n  What, for example, is \u201cthe message\u201d of the Greco-Roman\nmosaic of the word \u201cImagine\u201d that was donated to New\nYork City\u2019s Central Park in memory of John Lennon? See\nNYC Brief 18; App. to id., at A5. Some observers may\n\u201cimagine\u201d the musical contributions that John Lennon\nwould have made if he had not been killed. Others may\nthink of the lyrics of the Lennon song that obviously in\nspired the mosaic and may \u201cimagine\u201d a world without\nreligion, countries, possessions, greed, or hunger.2\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The  lyrics are as follows:\n\u201cImagine there\u2019s no heaven\nIt\u2019s easy if you try\nNo hell below us\nAbove us only sky\nImagine all the people\nLiving for today...\n\u201cImagine there\u2019s no countries\nIt isn\u2019t hard to do\nNothing to kill or die for\nAnd no religion too\nImagine all the people\nLiving life in peace...\n\u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer\nBut I\u2019m not the only one\nI hope someday you\u2019ll join us\nAnd the world will be as one\n\u201cImagine no possessions\nI wonder if you can\nNo need for greed or hunger\nA brotherhood of man\nImagine all the people\nSharing all the world...\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Con\nsider, for example, the statue of Pancho Villa that was\ngiven to the city of Tucson, Arizona, in 1981 by the Gov\nernment of Mexico with, according to a Tucson publica\ntion, \u201ca wry sense of irony.\u201d4 Does this statue commemo\nrate a \u201crevolutionary leader who advocated for agrarian\nreform and the poor\u201d or \u201ca violent bandit\u201d? IMLA Brief 13.\n   Contrary to respondent\u2019s apparent belief, it frequently is\nnot possible to identify a single \u201cmessage\u201d that is conveyed\nby an object or structure, and consequently, the thoughts\nor sentiments expressed by a government entity that\naccepts and displays such an object may be quite different\nfrom those of either its creator or its donor.5 By accepting\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer\nBut I\u2019m not the only one\nI hope someday you\u2019ll join us\nAnd the world will live as one.\u201d J.

Museums display\n\nworks of art that express many different sentiments, and the signifi\ncance of a donated work of art to its creator or donor may differ mark\nedly from a museum\u2019s reasons for accepting and displaying the work.\nFor example, a painting of a religious scene may have been commis\nsioned and painted to express religious thoughts and feelings. Even if\nthe painting is donated to the museum by a patron who shares those\nthoughts and feelings, it does not follow that the museum, by display\ning the painting, intends to convey or is perceived as conveying the\n14            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na privately donated monument and placing it on city\nproperty, a city engages in expressive conduct, but the\nintended and perceived significance of that conduct may\nnot coincide with the thinking of the monument\u2019s donor or\ncreator. Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is\nfunded by many small donations, the donors themselves\nmay differ in their interpretation of the monument\u2019s sig\nnificance.6 By accepting such a monument, a government\nentity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning\nthat any particular donor sees in the monument.\n   The message that a government entity conveys by allow\ning a monument to remain on its property may also be\naltered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in\nthe same vicinity. For example, following controversy over\nthe original design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a\ncompromise was reached that called for the nearby addi\ntion of a flagstaff and bronze Three Soldiers statue, which\nmany believed changed the overall effect of the memorial.\nSee, e.g., J. Mayo, War Memorials as Political Landscape:\nThe American Experience and Beyond 202\u2013203, 205\n(1988); K. Hass, Carried to the Wall: American Memory\nand the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 15\u201318 (1998).\n   The \u201cmessage\u201d conveyed by a monument may change\nover time. A study of war memorials found that \u201cpeople\nreinterpret\u201d the meaning of these memorials as \u201chistorical\ninterpretations\u201d and \u201cthe society around them changes.\u201d\nMayo, supra, at 8\u20139.\n   A striking example of how the interpretation of a monu\nment can evolve is provided by one of the most famous and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsame \u201cmessage.\u201d\n  6 For example, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund is a private\n\norganization that obtained funding from over 650,000 donors for the\nconstruction of the memorial itself. These donors expressed a wide\nrange of personal sentiments in contributing money for the memorial.\nSee, e.g., J. Scruggs & J. Swerdlow, To Heal a Nation: The Vietnam\nVeterans Memorial 23\u201328, 159 (1985).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The statue was given to this country by\nthe Third French Republic to express republican solidarity\nand friendship between the two countries. See J. Res. 6,\n44th Cong., 2d Sess. (1877), 19 Stat. 410 (accepting the\nstatue as an \u201cexpressive and felicitous memorial of the\nsympathy of the citizens of our sister Republic\u201d). At the\ninaugural ceremony, President Cleveland saw the statue\nas an emblem of international friendship and the wide\nspread influence of American ideals. See Inauguration of\nthe Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World 30 (1887).\nOnly later did the statue come to be viewed as a beacon\nwelcoming immigrants to a land of freedom. See Public\nPapers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. 2, July 3,\n1986, pp. 918\u2013919 (1989), Remarks at the Opening Cere\nmonies of the Statue of Liberty Centennial Celebration in\nNew York, New York; J. Higham, The Transformation of\nthe Statue of Liberty, in Send These To Me 74\u201380 (rev. ed.\n1984).\n                             C\n   Respondent and the Court of Appeals analogize the\ninstallation of permanent monuments in a public park to\nthe delivery of speeches and the holding of marches and\ndemonstrations, and they thus invoke the rule that a\npublic park is a traditional public forum for these activi\nties. But \u201cpublic forum principles . . . are out of place in\nthe context of this case.\u201d United States v. American Li\nbrary Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 205 (2003). The forum\ndoctrine has been applied in situations in which govern\nment-owned property or a government program was capa\nble of accommodating a large number of public speakers\nwithout defeating the essential function of the land or the\nprogram. For example, a park can accommodate many\nspeakers and, over time, many parades and demonstra\ntions. The Combined Federal Campaign permits hundreds\n16          PLEASANT GROVE CITY v.

Public parks have\nbeen used, \u201c \u2018time out of mind, . . . for purposes of assem\nbly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and dis\ncussing public questions,\u2019 \u201d Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 45\n(quoting Hague, 307 U. S., at 515), but \u201cone would be hard\npressed to find a \u2018long tradition\u2019 of allowing people to\npermanently occupy public space with any manner of\nmonuments.\u201d 499 F. 3d, at 1173 (Lucero, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc).\n   Speakers, no matter how long-winded, eventually come\nto the end of their remarks; persons distributing leaflets\nand carrying signs at some point tire and go home; monu\nments, however, endure. They monopolize the use of the\nland on which they stand and interfere permanently with\nother uses of public space. A public park, over the years,\ncan provide a soapbox for a very large number of orators\u2014\noften, for all who want to speak\u2014but it is hard to imagine\nhow a public park could be opened up for the installation\nof permanent monuments by every person or group wish\ning to engage in that form of expression.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                 17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondent contends that this issue \u201ccan be dealt with\nthrough content-neutral time, place and manner restric\ntions, including the option of a ban on all unattended\ndisplays.\u201d Brief for Respondent 14. On this view, when\nFrance presented the Statue of Liberty to the United\nStates in 1884, this country had the option of either (a)\ndeclining France\u2019s offer or (b) accepting the gift, but pro\nviding a comparable location in the harbor of New York for\nother statues of a similar size and nature (e.g., a Statue of\nAutocracy, if one had been offered by, say, the German\nEmpire or Imperial Russia).\n   While respondent and some of its amici deride the fears\nexpressed about the consequences of the Court of Appeals\nholding in this case, those concerns are well founded. If\ngovernment entities must maintain viewpoint neutrality\nin their selection of donated monuments, they must either\n\u201cbrace themselves for an influx of clutter\u201d or face the\npressure to remove longstanding and cherished monu\nments. See 499 F. 3d, at 1175 (McConnell, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc). Every jurisdiction that\nhas accepted a donated war memorial may be asked to\nprovide equal treatment for a donated monument ques\ntioning the cause for which the veterans fought. New\nYork City, having accepted a donated statue of one heroic\ndog (Balto, the sled dog who brought medicine to Nome,\nAlaska, during a diphtheria epidemic)7 may be pressed to\naccept monuments for other dogs who are claimed to be\nequally worthy of commemoration. The obvious truth of\nthe matter is that if public parks were considered to be\ntraditional public forums for the purpose of erecting pri\nvately donated monuments, most parks would have little\nchoice but to refuse all such donations. And where the\napplication of forum analysis would lead almost inexorably\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See NYC Brief 2; App. to Brief for American Catholic Lawyers Asso\n\nciation as Amicus Curiae 1a\u201310.\n18           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto closing of the forum, it is obvious that forum analysis is\nout of place.\n  Respondent compares the present case to Capitol\nSquare Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753\n(1995), but that case involved a very different situation\u2014a\nrequest by a private group, the Ku Klux Klan, to erect a\ncross for a period of 16 days on public property that had\nbeen opened up for similar temporary displays, including a\nChristmas tree and a menorah. See id., at 758. Although\nsome public parks can accommodate and may be made\ngenerally available for temporary private displays, the\nsame is rarely true for permanent monuments.\n  To be sure, there are limited circumstances in which the\nforum doctrine might properly be applied to a permanent\nmonument\u2014for example, if a town created a monument on\nwhich all of its residents (or all those meeting some other\ncriterion) could place the name of a person to be honored\nor some other private message. But as a general matter,\nforum analysis simply does not apply to the installation of\npermanent monuments on public property.\n                              V\n   In sum, we hold that the City\u2019s decision to accept certain\nprivately donated monuments while rejecting respondent\u2019s\nis best viewed as a form of government speech. As a re\nsult, the City\u2019s decision is not subject to the Free Speech\nClause, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding other\nwise. We therefore reverse.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

While I join\nthe Court\u2019s persuasive opinion, I think the reasons justify\ning the city\u2019s refusal would have been equally valid if its\nacceptance of the monument, instead of being character\nized as \u201cgovernment speech,\u201d had merely been deemed an\nimplicit endorsement of the donor\u2019s message. See Capitol\nSquare Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.

The Court\u2019s opinion in this\ncase signals no expansion of that doctrine. And by joining\nthe Court\u2019s opinion, I do not mean to indicate agreement\nwith our earlier decisions. Unlike other decisions relying\non the government speech doctrine, our decision in this\ncase excuses no retaliation for, or coercion of, private\nspeech. Cf. Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 438 (SOUTER, J., dis\nsenting); Rust, 500 U. S., at 212 (Blackmun, J., dissent\ning). Nor is it likely, given the near certainty that observ\n2           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring\n\ners will associate permanent displays with the govern\nmental property owner, that the government will be able\nto avoid political accountability for the views that it en\ndorses or expresses through this means. Cf. Johanns, 544\nU. S., at 571\u2013572 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Finally, recog\nnizing permanent displays on public property as govern\nment speech will not give the government free license to\ncommunicate offensive or partisan messages. For even if\nthe Free Speech Clause neither restricts nor protects\ngovernment speech, government speakers are bound by\nthe Constitution\u2019s other proscriptions, including those\nsupplied by the Establishment and Equal Protection\nClauses. Together with the checks imposed by our democ\nratic processes, these constitutional safeguards ensure\nthat the effect of today\u2019s decision will be limited.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of that\nquestion and join its opinion in full. But it is also obvious\nthat from the start, the case has been litigated in the\nshadow of the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause:\nthe city wary of associating itself too closely with the Ten\nCommandments monument displayed in the park, lest\nthat be deemed a breach in the so-called \u201cwall of separa\ntion between church and State,\u201d Reynolds v. United States,\n98 U. S. 145, 164 (1879); respondent exploiting that hesi\ntation to argue that the monument is not government\nspeech because the city has not sufficiently \u201cadopted\u201d its\nmessage. Respondent menacingly observed that while the\ncity could have formally adopted the monument as its\nown, that \u201cmight of course raise Establishment Clause\nissues.\u201d Brief for Respondent 34, n. 11.\n   The city ought not fear that today\u2019s victory has propelled\nit from the Free Speech Clause frying pan into the Estab\nlishment Clause fire. Contrary to respondent\u2019s intima\ntions, there are very good reasons to be confident that\nthe park displays do not violate any part of the First\nAmendment.\n2            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\n   In Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677 (2005), this Court\nupheld against Establishment Clause challenge a virtually\nidentical Ten Commandments monument, donated by the\nvery same organization (the Fraternal Order of Eagles),\nwhich was displayed on the grounds surrounding the\nTexas State Capitol. Nothing in that decision suggested\nthat the outcome turned on a finding that the monument\nwas only \u201cprivate\u201d speech. To the contrary, all the Jus\ntices agreed that government speech was at issue, but the\nEstablishment Clause argument was nonetheless rejected.\nFor the plurality, that was because the Ten Command\nments \u201chave an undeniable historical meaning\u201d in addition\nto their \u201creligious significance,\u201d id., at 690 (opinion of\nRehnquist, C. J.). JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in the\njudgment, agreed that the monument conveyed a permis\nsible secular message, as evidenced by its location in a\npark that contained multiple monuments and historical\nmarkers; by the fact that it had been donated by the Ea\ngles \u201cas part of that organization\u2019s efforts to combat juve\nnile delinquency\u201d; and by the length of time (40 years) for\nwhich the monument had gone unchallenged. Id., at 701\u2013\n703. See also id., at 739\u2013740 (SOUTER, J., dissenting).\n   Even accepting the narrowest reading of the narrowest\nopinion necessary to the judgment in Van Orden, there is\nlittle basis to distinguish the monument in this case:\nPioneer Park includes \u201c15 permanent displays,\u201d ante, at 1\u2013\n2; it was donated by the Eagles as part of its national\neffort to combat juvenile delinquency, Brief for Respon\ndent 3; and it was erected in 1971, ibid., which means it is\napproaching its (momentous!) 40th anniversary.\n   The city can safely exhale. Its residents and visitors can\nnow return to enjoying Pioneer Park\u2019s wishing well, its\nhistoric granary\u2014and, yes, even its Ten Commandments\nmonument\u2014without fear that they are complicit in an\nestablishment of religion.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I do so,\nhowever, on the understanding that the \u201cgovernment\nspeech\u201d doctrine is a rule of thumb, not a rigid category.\nWere the City to discriminate in the selection of perma\nnent monuments on grounds unrelated to the display\u2019s\ntheme, say solely on political grounds, its action might\nwell violate the First Amendment.\n    In my view, courts must apply categories such as \u201cgov\nernment speech,\u201d \u201cpublic forums,\u201d \u201climited public forums,\u201d\nand \u201cnonpublic forums\u201d with an eye towards their pur\nposes\u2014lest we turn \u201cfree speech\u201d doctrine into a jurispru\ndence of labels. Cf. United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S.\n720, 740\u2013743 (1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Conse\nquently, we must sometimes look beyond an initial catego\nrization. And, in doing so, it helps to ask whether a gov\nernment action burdens speech disproportionately in light\nof the action\u2019s tendency to further a legitimate government\nobjective. See, e.g., Ysursa v. Pocatello Ed. Assn., ante, at\n1\u20134 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart); Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U.\nS. 377, 404 (2000) (BREYER, J., concurring).\n    Were we to do so here, we would find\u2014for reasons that\nthe Court sets forth\u2014that the City\u2019s action, while prevent\ning Summum from erecting its monument, does not dis\n2            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nproportionately restrict Summum\u2019s freedom of expression.\nThe City has not closed off its parks to speech; no one\nclaims that the City prevents Summum\u2019s members from\nengaging in speech in a form more transient than a per\nmanent monument. Rather, the City has simply reserved\nsome space in the park for projects designed to further\nother than free-speech goals. And that is perfectly proper.\nAfter all, parks do not serve speech-related interests\nalone. To the contrary, cities use park space to further a\nvariety of recreational, historical, educational, aesthetic,\nand other civic interests. To reserve to the City the power\nto pick and choose among proposed monuments according\nto criteria reasonably related to one or more of these le\ngitimate ends restricts Summum\u2019s expression, but, given\nthe impracticality of alternatives and viewed in light of\nthe City\u2019s legitimate needs, the restriction is not dispro\nportionate. Analyzed either way, as \u201cgovernment speech\u201d\nor as a proportionate restriction on Summum\u2019s expression,\nthe City\u2019s action here is lawful.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

See Board of\nRegents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S.\n217, 235 (2000) (noting government speech may \u201cpromote\n[government\u2019s] own policies or . . . advance a particular\nidea\u201d). And although the government should lose when\nthe character of the speech is at issue and its governmen\ntal nature has not been made clear, see Johanns v. Live\nstock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550, 577 (2005) (SOUTER,\nJ., dissenting), I also agree with the Court that the city\nneed not satisfy the particular formality urged by Sum\nmum as a condition of recognizing that the expression\nhere falls within the public category. I have qualms,\nhowever, about accepting the position that public monu\nments are government speech categorically. See ante, at 8\n(\u201cJust as government-commissioned and government\nfinanced monuments speak for the government, so do\nprivately financed and donated monuments that the gov\nernment accepts and displays to the public on government\nland\u201d).\n   Because the government speech doctrine, as JUSTICE\nSTEVENS notes, ante, at 1 (concurring opinion), is \u201crecently\n2            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n               SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nminted,\u201d it would do well for us to go slow in setting its\nbounds, which will affect existing doctrine in ways not yet\nexplored.     Even though, for example, Establishment\nClause issues have been neither raised nor briefed before\nus, there is no doubt that this case and its government\nspeech claim has been litigated by the parties with one eye\non the Establishment Clause, see ante, at 1 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring). The interaction between the \u201cgovernment\nspeech doctrine\u201d and Establishment Clause principles has\nnot, however, begun to be worked out.\n  The case shows that it may not be easy to work out.\nAfter today\u2019s decision, whenever a government maintains\na monument it will presumably be understood to be engag\ning in government speech. If the monument has some\nreligious character, the specter of violating the Establish\nment Clause will behoove it to take care to avoid the ap\npearance of a flat-out establishment of religion, in the\nsense of the government\u2019s adoption of the tenets expressed\nor symbolized. In such an instance, there will be safety in\nnumbers, and it will be in the interest of a careful gov\nernment to accept other monuments to stand nearby, to\ndilute the appearance of adopting whatever particular\nreligious position the single example alone might stand\nfor. As mementoes and testimonials pile up, however, the\nchatter may well make it less intuitively obvious that the\ngovernment is speaking in its own right simply by main\ntaining the monuments.\n  If a case like that occurred, as suspicion grew that some\nof the permanent displays were not government speech at\nall (or at least had an equally private character associated\nwith private donors), a further Establishment Clause\nprohibition would surface, the bar against preferring some\nreligious speakers over others. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\nU. S. 38, 113 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe\nClause was also designed to stop the Federal Government\nfrom asserting a preference for one religious denomination\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n               SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nor sect over others\u201d). But the government could well ar\ngue, as a development of government speech doctrine, that\nwhen it expresses its own views, it is free of the Estab\nlishment Clause\u2019s stricture against discriminating among\nreligious sects or groups. Under this view of the relation\nship between the two doctrines, it would be easy for a\ngovernment to favor some private religious speakers over\nothers by its choice of monuments to accept.\n   Whether that view turns out to be sound is more than I\ncan say at this point. It is simply unclear how the rela\ntively new category of government speech will relate to the\nmore traditional categories of Establishment Clause\nanalysis, and this case is not an occasion to speculate. It\nis an occasion, however, to try to keep the inevitable issues\nopen, and as simple as they can be. One way to do that is\nto recognize that there are circumstances in which gov\nernment maintenance of monuments does not look like\ngovernment speech at all. Sectarian identifications on\nmarkers in Arlington Cemetery come to mind. And to\nrecognize that is to forgo any categorical rule at this point.\n   To avoid relying on a per se rule to say when speech is\ngovernmental, the best approach that occurs to me is to\nask whether a reasonable and fully informed observer\nwould understand the expression to be government\nspeech, as distinct from private speech the government\nchooses to oblige by allowing the monument to be placed\non public land. This reasonable observer test for govern\nmental character is of a piece with the one for spotting\nforbidden governmental endorsement of religion in the\nEstablishment Clause cases. See, e.g., County of Alle\ngheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pitts\nburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 630, 635\u2013636 (1989)\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). The adoption of it would thus serve coherence\nwithin Establishment Clause law, and it would make\nsense of our common understanding that some monu\n4           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n              SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nments on public land display religious symbolism that\nclearly does not express a government\u2019s chosen views.\n   Application of this observer test provides the reason I\nfind the monument here to be government expression.\n",

SUMMUM\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 07\u2013665.      Argued November 12, 2008\u2014Decided February 25, 2009\nPioneer Park (Park), a public park in petitioner Pleasant Grove City\n  (City), has at least 11 permanent, privately donated displays, includ\n  ing a Ten Commandments monument. In rejecting the request of re\n  spondent Summum, a religious organization, to erect a monument\n  containing the Seven Aphorisms of Summum, the City explained that\n  it limited Park monuments to those either directly related to the\n  City\u2019s history or donated by groups with longstanding community\n  ties. After the City put that policy and other criteria into writing, re\n  spondent renewed its request, but did not describe the monument\u2019s\n  historical significance or respondent\u2019s connection to the community.\n  The City rejected the request, and respondent filed suit, claiming\n  that the City and petitioner officials had violated the First Amend\n  ment\u2019s Free Speech Clause by accepting the Ten Commandments\n  monument but rejecting respondent\u2019s proposed monument. The Dis\n  trict Court denied respondent\u2019s preliminary injunction request, but\n  the Tenth Circuit reversed. Noting that it had previously found the\n  Ten Commandments monument to be private rather than govern\n  ment speech and that public parks have traditionally been regarded\n  as public forums, the court held that, because the exclusion of the\n  monument was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny, the City was re\n  quired to erect it immediately.\nHeld: The placement of a permanent monument in a public park is a\n form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny\n under the Free Speech Clause. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) Because that Clause restricts government regulation of private\n speech but not government speech, whether petitioners were engag\n ing in their own expressive conduct or providing a forum for private\n speech determines which precedents govern here.

S. 819, 833,\n    and to select the views that it wants to express, see, e.g., Rust v. Sul\n    livan, 500 U. S. 173, 194. It may exercise this same freedom when it\n    receives private assistance for the purpose of delivering a govern\n    ment-controlled message. See Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn.,\n    544 U. S. 550, 562. This does not mean that there are no restraints\n    on government speech. For example, government speech must com\n    port with the Establishment Clause. In addition, public officials\u2019 in\n    volvement in advocacy may be limited by law, regulation, or practice;\n    and a government entity is ultimately \u201caccountable to the electorate\n    and the political process for its advocacy,\u201d Board of Regents of Univ.\n    of Wis.

S. 37, 45, but\n    content-based restrictions must satisfy strict scrutiny, i.e., they must\n    be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, see\n    Cornelius, supra, at 800. Restrictions based on viewpoint are also\n    prohibited. Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 463. Government restric\n    tions on speech in a \u201cdesignated public forum\u201d are subject to the same\n    strict scrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum. Corne\n    lius, supra, at 800. And where government creates a forum that is\n    limited to use by certain groups or dedicated to the discussion of cer\n    tain subjects, Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, n. 7, it may impose rea\n    sonable and viewpoint-neutral restrictions, see Good News Club v.\n    Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\u2013107. Pp. 6\u20137.\n       (b) Permanent monuments displayed on public property typically\n    represent government speech. Governments have long used monu\n    ments to speak to the public. Thus, a government-commissioned and\n    government-financed monument placed on public land constitutes\n    government speech. So, too, are privately financed and donated\n    monuments that the government accepts for public display on gov\n    ernment land. While government entities regularly accept privately\n    funded or donated monuments, their general practice has been one of\n    selective receptivity. Because city parks play an important role in de\n    fining the identity that a city projects to its residents and the outside\n    world, cities take care in accepting donated monuments, selecting\n    those that portray what the government decisionmakers view as ap\n    propriate for the place in question, based on esthetics, history, and\n    local culture. The accepted monuments are meant to convey and\n    have the effect of conveying a government message and thus consti\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

Pp. 7\u201310.\n     (c) Here, the Park\u2019s monuments clearly represent government\n  speech. Although many were donated in completed form by private\n  entities, the City has \u201ceffectively controlled\u201d their messages by exer\n  cising \u201cfinal approval authority\u201d over their selection. Johanns, supra,\n  at 560\u2013561. The City has selected monuments that present the im\n  age that the City wishes to project to Park visitors; it has taken own\n  ership of most of the monuments in the Park, including the Ten Com\n  mandments monument; and it has now expressly set out selection\n  criteria. P. 10.\n     (d) Respondent\u2019s legitimate concern that the government speech\n  doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for favoring certain viewpoints\n  does not mean that a government entity should be required to em\n  brace publicly a privately donated monument\u2019s \u201cmessage\u201d in order to\n  escape Free Speech Clause restrictions. A city engages in expressive\n  conduct by accepting and displaying a privately donated monument,\n  but it does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any par\n  ticular donor sees in the monument. A government\u2019s message may be\n  altered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in the same\n  vicinity. It may also change over time. Pp. 10\u201315.\n     (e) \u201c[P]ublic forum principles . . . are out of place in the context of\n  this case.\u201d United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S.\n  194, 205. The forum doctrine applies where a government property\n  or program is capable of accommodating a large number of public\n  speakers without defeating the essential function of the land or pro\n  gram, but public parks can accommodate only a limited number of\n  permanent monuments. If governments must maintain viewpoint\n  neutrality in selecting donated monuments, they must either prepare\n  for cluttered parks or face pressure to remove longstanding and cher\n  ished monuments. Were public parks considered traditional public\n  forums for the purpose of erecting privately donated monuments,\n  most parks would have little choice but to refuse all such donations.\n  And if forum analysis would lead almost inexorably to closing of the\n  forum, forum analysis is out of place.

SUMMUM\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 25, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case presents the question whether the Free\nSpeech Clause of the First Amendment entitles a private\ngroup to insist that a municipality permit it to place a\npermanent monument in a city park in which other do\nnated monuments were previously erected. The Court of\nAppeals held that the municipality was required to accept\nthe monument because a public park is a traditional pub\nlic forum. We conclude, however, that although a park is a\ntraditional public forum for speeches and other transitory\nexpressive acts, the display of a permanent monument in\na public park is not a form of expression to which forum\nanalysis applies. Instead, the placement of a permanent\nmonument in a public park is best viewed as a form of\ngovernment speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny\nunder the Free Speech Clause.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Pioneer Park (or Park) is a 2.5 acre public park located\nin the Historic District of Pleasant Grove City (or City) in\nUtah. The Park currently contains 15 permanent dis\n2                PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nplays, at least 11 of which were donated by private groups\nor individuals. These include an historic granary, a wish\ning well, the City\u2019s first fire station, a September 11\nmonument, and a Ten Commandments monument do\nnated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in 1971.\n  Respondent Summum is a religious organization\nfounded in 1975 and headquartered in Salt Lake City,\nUtah. On two separate occasions in 2003, Summum\u2019s\npresident wrote a letter to the City\u2019s mayor requesting\npermission to erect a \u201cstone monument,\u201d which would\ncontain \u201cthe Seven Aphorisms of SUMMUM\u201d1 and be\nsimilar in size and nature to the Ten Commandments\nmonument. App. 57, 59. The City denied the requests\nand explained that its practice was to limit monuments in\nthe Park to those that \u201ceither (1) directly relate to the\nhistory of Pleasant Grove, or (2) were donated by groups\nwith longstanding ties to the Pleasant Grove community.\u201d\nId., at 61. The following year, the City passed a resolution\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Respondent\u2019s\n                 brief describes the church and the Seven Aphorisms as\nfollows:\n   \u201cThe Summum church incorporates elements of Gnostic Christianity,\nteaching that spiritual knowledge is experiential and that through\ndevotion comes revelation, which \u2018modifies human perceptions, and\ntransfigures the individual.\u2019 See The Teachings of Summum are the\nTeachings of Gnostic Christianity, http://www.summum.us/philosophy/\ngnosticism.shtml (visited Aug. 15, 2008).\n   \u201cCentral to Summum religious belief and practice are the Seven\nPrinciples of Creation (the \u201cSeven Aphorisms\u201d). According to Summum\ndoctrine, the Seven Aphorisms were inscribed on the original tablets\nhanded down by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. . . . Because Moses\nbelieved that the Israelites were not ready to receive the Aphorisms, he\nshared them only with a select group of people. In the Summum\nExodus account, Moses then destroyed the original tablets, traveled\nback to Mount Sinai, and returned with a second set of tablets con\ntaining the Ten Commandments. See The Aphorisms of Summum\nand the Ten Commandments, http://www.summum.us/philosophy/\ntencommandments.shtml (visited Aug. 15, 2008).\u201d Brief for Respondent\n1\u20132.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nputting this policy into writing. The resolution also men\ntioned other criteria, such as safety and esthetics.\n   In May 2005, respondent\u2019s president again wrote to the\nmayor asking to erect a monument, but the letter did not\ndescribe the monument, its historical significance, or\nSummum\u2019s connection to the community. The city council\nrejected this request.\n                             B\n  In 2005, respondent filed this action against the City\nand various local officials (petitioners), asserting, among\nother claims, that petitioners had violated the Free Speech\nClause of the First Amendment by accepting the Ten\nCommandments monument but rejecting the proposed\nSeven Aphorisms monument. Respondent sought a pre\nliminary injunction directing the City to permit Summum\nto erect its monument in Pioneer Park. After the District\nCourt denied Summum\u2019s preliminary injunction request,\nNo. 2:05CV00638, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3421838</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D Utah, Nov. 22,\n2006), respondent appealed, pressing solely its free speech\nclaim.\n  A panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed. 483 F. 3d 1044\n(2007). The panel noted that it had previously found the\nTen Commandments monument to be private rather than\ngovernment speech. See Summum v. Ogden, 297 F. 3d\n995 (2002). Noting that public parks have traditionally\nbeen regarded as public forums, the panel held that the\nCity could not reject the Seven Aphorisms monument\nunless it had a compelling justification that could not be\nserved by more narrowly tailored means. See 483 F. 3d, at\n1054. The panel then concluded that the exclusion of\nrespondent\u2019s monument was unlikely to survive this strict\nscrutiny, and the panel therefore held that the City was\nrequired to erect Summum\u2019s monument immediately.\n  The Tenth Circuit denied the City\u2019s petition for rehear\ning en banc by an equally divided vote. 499 F. 3d 1170\n4           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2007). Judge Lucero dissented, arguing that the Park\nwas not a traditional public forum for the purpose of dis\nplaying monuments. Id., at 1171. Judge McConnell also\ndissented, contending that the monuments in the Park\nconstitute government speech. Id., at 1174.\n  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n   No prior decision of this Court has addressed the appli\ncation of the Free Speech Clause to a government entity\u2019s\nacceptance of privately donated, permanent monuments\nfor installation in a public park, and the parties disagree\nsharply about the line of precedents that governs this\nsituation. Petitioners contend that the pertinent cases are\nthose concerning government speech. Respondent, on the\nother hand, agrees with the Court of Appeals panel that\nthe applicable cases are those that analyze private speech\nin a public forum. The parties\u2019 fundamental disagreement\nthus centers on the nature of petitioners\u2019 conduct when\nthey permitted privately donated monuments to be erected\nin Pioneer Park. Were petitioners engaging in their own\nexpressive conduct? Or were they providing a forum for\nprivate speech?\n                             A\n   If petitioners were engaging in their own expressive\nconduct, then the Free Speech Clause has no application.\nThe Free Speech Clause restricts government regulation\nof private speech; it does not regulate government speech.\nSee Johanns v.

S. 569, 598 (1998) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment) (\u201cIt is the very business of government to favor\nand disfavor points of view\u201d).\n   Indeed, it is not easy to imagine how government could\nfunction if it lacked this freedom. \u201cIf every citizen were to\nhave a right to insist that no one paid by public funds\nexpress a view with which he disagreed, debate over is\nsues of great concern to the public would be limited to\nthose in the private sector, and the process of government\nas we know it radically transformed.\u201d Keller v. State Bar\nof Cal., 496 U. S. 1, 12\u201313 (1990). See also Johanns, 544\nU.

See id., at 562 (opinion of the Court)\n(where the government controls the message, \u201cit is not\nprecluded from relying on the government-speech doctrine\nmerely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmen\ntal sources\u201d); Rosenberger, supra, at 833 (a government\nentity may \u201cregulate the content of what is or is not ex\npressed . . . when it enlists private entities to convey its\nown message\u201d).\n   This does not mean that there are no restraints on\ngovernment speech. For example, government speech\n6            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmust comport with the Establishment Clause. The in\nvolvement of public officials in advocacy may be limited by\nlaw, regulation, or practice. And of course, a government\nentity is ultimately \u201caccountable to the electorate and the\npolitical process for its advocacy.\u201d Southworth, 529 U.

This\nCourt long ago recognized that members of the public\nretain strong free speech rights when they venture into\npublic streets and parks, \u201cwhich \u2018have immemorially been\nheld in trust for the use of the public and, time out of\nmind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communi\ncating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public\nquestions.\u2019 \u201d Perry Ed.

In order to preserve this freedom,\ngovernment entities are strictly limited in their ability to\nregulate private speech in such \u201ctraditional public fora.\u201d\nCornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473\nU. S. 788, 800 (1985). Reasonable time, place, and man\nner restrictions are allowed, see Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at\n45, but any restriction based on the content of the speech\nmust satisfy strict scrutiny, that is, the restriction must be\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government inter\nest, see Cornelius, supra, at 800, and restrictions based on\nviewpoint are prohibited, see Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S.\n455, 463 (1980).\n  With the concept of the traditional public forum as a\nstarting point, this Court has recognized that members of\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe public have free speech rights on other types of gov\nernment property and in certain other government pro\ngrams that share essential attributes of a traditional\npublic forum. We have held that a government entity may\ncreate \u201ca designated public forum\u201d if government property\nthat has not traditionally been regarded as a public forum\nis intentionally opened up for that purpose. See Cornelius,\n473 U. S., at 802. Government restrictions on speech in a\ndesignated public forum are subject to the same strict\nscrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum. Id.,\nat 800.\n   The Court has also held that a government entity may\ncreate a forum that is limited to use by certain groups or\ndedicated solely to the discussion of certain subjects.\nPerry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, n. 7. In such a forum, a\ngovernment entity may impose restrictions on speech that\nare reasonable and viewpoint-neutral. See Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106\u2013107\n(2001).\n                             III\n  There may be situations in which it is difficult to tell\nwhether a government entity is speaking on its own behalf\nor is providing a forum for private speech, but this case\ndoes not present such a situation. Permanent monuments\ndisplayed on public property typically represent govern\nment speech.\n  Governments have long used monuments to speak to the\npublic. Since ancient times, kings, emperors, and other\nrulers have erected statues of themselves to remind their\nsubjects of their authority and power. Triumphal arches,\ncolumns, and other monuments have been built to com\nmemorate military victories and sacrifices and other\nevents of civic importance. A monument, by definition, is\na structure that is designed as a means of expression.\nWhen a government entity arranges for the construction of\n8           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na monument, it does so because it wishes to convey some\nthought or instill some feeling in those who see the struc\nture. Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondent dis\nputes the obvious proposition that a monument that is\ncommissioned and financed by a government body for\nplacement on public land constitutes government speech.\n   Just as government-commissioned and government\nfinanced monuments speak for the government, so do\nprivately financed and donated monuments that the gov\nernment accepts and displays to the public on government\nland. It certainly is not common for property owners to\nopen up their property for the installation of permanent\nmonuments that convey a message with which they do not\nwish to be associated. And because property owners typi\ncally do not permit the construction of such monuments on\ntheir land, persons who observe donated monuments\nroutinely\u2014and reasonably\u2014interpret them as conveying\nsome message on the property owner\u2019s behalf. In this\ncontext, there is little chance that observers will fail to\nappreciate the identity of the speaker. This is true\nwhether the monument is located on private property or\non public property, such as national, state, or city park\nland.\n   We think it is fair to say that throughout our Nation\u2019s\nhistory, the general government practice with respect to\ndonated monuments has been one of selective receptivity.\nA great many of the monuments that adorn the Nation\u2019s\npublic parks were financed with private funds or donated\nby private parties. Sites managed by the National Park\nService contain thousands of privately designed or funded\ncommemorative objects, including the Statue of Liberty,\nthe Marine Corps War Memorial (the Iwo Jima monu\nment), and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. States and\ncities likewise have received thousands of donated monu\nments. See, e.g., App. to Brief for International Municipal\nLawyers Association as Amicus Curiae 15a\u201329a (hereinaf\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nter IMLA Brief) (listing examples); Brief for American\nLegion et al. as Amici Curiae 7, and n. 2 (same). By ac\ncepting monuments that are privately funded or donated,\ngovernment entities save tax dollars and are able to ac\nquire monuments that they could not have afforded to\nfund on their own.\n   But while government entities regularly accept pri\nvately funded or donated monuments, they have exercised\nselectivity. An example discussed by the city of New York\nas amicus curiae is illustrative. In the wake of the contro\nversy generated in 1876 when the city turned down a\ndonated monument to honor Daniel Webster, the city\nadopted rules governing the acceptance of artwork for\npermanent placement in city parks, requiring, among\nother things, that \u201cany proposed gift of art had to be\nviewed either in its finished condition or as a model before\nacceptance.\u201d Brief for City of New York as Amicus Curiae\n4\u20135 (hereinafter NYC Brief). Across the country, \u201cmunici\npalities generally exercise editorial control over donated\nmonuments through prior submission requirements,\ndesign input, requested modifications, written criteria,\nand legislative approvals of specific content proposals.\u201d\nIMLA Brief 21.\n   Public parks are often closely identified in the public\nmind with the government unit that owns the land. City\nparks\u2014ranging from those in small towns, like Pioneer\nPark in Pleasant Grove City, to those in major metropo\nlises, like Central Park in New York City\u2014commonly play\nan important role in defining the identity that a city pro\njects to its own residents and to the outside world. Accord\ningly, cities and other jurisdictions take some care in\naccepting donated monuments. Government decisionmak\ners select the monuments that portray what they view as\nappropriate for the place in question, taking into account\nsuch content-based factors as esthetics, history, and local\nculture. The monuments that are accepted, therefore, are\n10          PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmeant to convey and have the effect of conveying a gov\nernment message, and they thus constitute government\nspeech.\n                                IV\n                                 A\n   In this case, it is clear that the monuments in Pleasant\nGrove\u2019s Pioneer Park represent government speech. Al\nthough many of the monuments were not designed or built\nby the City and were donated in completed form by private\nentities, the City decided to accept those donations and to\ndisplay them in the Park. Respondent does not claim that\nthe City ever opened up the Park for the placement of\nwhatever permanent monuments might be offered by\nprivate donors. Rather, the City has \u201ceffectively con\ntrolled\u201d the messages sent by the monuments in the Park\nby exercising \u201cfinal approval authority\u201d over their selec\ntion. Johanns, 544 U. S., at 560\u2013561. The City has se\nlected those monuments that it wants to display for the\npurpose of presenting the image of the City that it wishes\nto project to all who frequent the Park; it has taken own\nership of most of the monuments in the Park, including\nthe Ten Commandments monument that is the focus of\nrespondent\u2019s concern; and the City has now expressly set\nforth the criteria it will use in making future selections.\n                            B\n   Respondent voices the legitimate concern that the gov\nernment speech doctrine not be used as a subterfuge for\nfavoring certain private speakers over others based on\nviewpoint. Respondent\u2019s suggested solution is to require a\ngovernment entity accepting a privately donated monu\nment to go through a formal process of adopting a resolu\ntion publicly embracing \u201cthe message\u201d that the monument\nconveys. See Brief for Respondent 33\u201334, 57.\n   We see no reason for imposing a requirement of this\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsort. The parks of this country contain thousands of do\nnated monuments that government entities have used for\ntheir own expressive purposes, usually without producing\nthe sort of formal documentation that respondent now\nsays is required to escape Free Speech Clause restrictions.\nRequiring all of these jurisdictions to go back and proclaim\nformally that they adopt all of these monuments as their\nown expressive vehicles would be a pointless exercise that\nthe Constitution does not mandate.\n   In this case, for example, although respondent argues\nthat Pleasant Grove City has not adequately \u201ccontroll[ed]\nthe message,\u201d id., at 31, of the Ten Commandments monu\nment, the City took ownership of that monument and put\nit on permanent display in a park that it owns and man\nages and that is linked to the City\u2019s identity. All rights\npreviously possessed by the monument\u2019s donor have been\nrelinquished. The City\u2019s actions provided a more dramatic\nform of adoption than the sort of formal endorsement that\nrespondent would demand, unmistakably signifying to all\nPark visitors that the City intends the monument to speak\non its behalf. And the City has made no effort to abridge\nthe traditional free speech rights\u2014the right to speak,\ndistribute leaflets, etc.\u2014that may be exercised by respon\ndent and others in Pioneer Park.\n   What respondent demands, however, is that the City\n\u201cadopt\u201d or \u201cembrace\u201d \u201cthe message\u201d that it associates with\nthe monument. Id., at 33\u201334, 57. Respondent seems to\nthink that a monument can convey only one \u201cmessage\u201d\u2014\nwhich is, presumably, the message intended by the do\nnor\u2014and that, if a government entity that accepts a\nmonument for placement on its property does not formally\nembrace that message, then the government has not en\ngaged in expressive conduct.\n   This argument fundamentally misunderstands the way\nmonuments convey meaning. The meaning conveyed by a\nmonument is generally not a simple one like \u201c \u2018Beef. It\u2019s\n12              PLEASANT GROVE CITY v.

Even when\na monument features the written word, the monument\nmay be intended to be interpreted, and may in fact be\ninterpreted by different observers, in a variety of ways.\nMonuments called to our attention by the briefing in this\ncase illustrate this phenomenon.\n  What, for example, is \u201cthe message\u201d of the Greco-Roman\nmosaic of the word \u201cImagine\u201d that was donated to New\nYork City\u2019s Central Park in memory of John Lennon? See\nNYC Brief 18; App. to id., at A5. Some observers may\n\u201cimagine\u201d the musical contributions that John Lennon\nwould have made if he had not been killed.

Con\nsider, for example, the statue of Pancho Villa that was\ngiven to the city of Tucson, Arizona, in 1981 by the Gov\nernment of Mexico with, according to a Tucson publica\ntion, \u201ca wry sense of irony.\u201d4 Does this statue commemo\nrate a \u201crevolutionary leader who advocated for agrarian\nreform and the poor\u201d or \u201ca violent bandit\u201d?

Museums display\n\nworks of art that express many different sentiments, and the signifi\ncance of a donated work of art to its creator or donor may differ mark\nedly from a museum\u2019s reasons for accepting and displaying the work.\nFor example, a painting of a religious scene may have been commis\nsioned and painted to express religious thoughts and feelings. Even if\nthe painting is donated to the museum by a patron who shares those\nthoughts and feelings, it does not follow that the museum, by display\ning the painting, intends to convey or is perceived as conveying the\n14            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na privately donated monument and placing it on city\nproperty, a city engages in expressive conduct, but the\nintended and perceived significance of that conduct may\nnot coincide with the thinking of the monument\u2019s donor or\ncreator. Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is\nfunded by many small donations, the donors themselves\nmay differ in their interpretation of the monument\u2019s sig\nnificance.6 By accepting such a monument, a government\nentity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning\nthat any particular donor sees in the monument.\n   The message that a government entity conveys by allow\ning a monument to remain on its property may also be\naltered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in\nthe same vicinity. For example, following controversy over\nthe original design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a\ncompromise was reached that called for the nearby addi\ntion of a flagstaff and bronze Three Soldiers statue, which\nmany believed changed the overall effect of the memorial.\nSee, e.g., J. Mayo, War Memorials as Political Landscape:\nThe American Experience and Beyond 202\u2013203, 205\n(1988); K. Hass, Carried to the Wall: American Memory\nand the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 15\u201318 (1998).\n   The \u201cmessage\u201d conveyed by a monument may change\nover time. A study of war memorials found that \u201cpeople\nreinterpret\u201d the meaning of these memorials as \u201chistorical\ninterpretations\u201d and \u201cthe society around them changes.\u201d\nMayo, supra, at 8\u20139.\n   A striking example of how the interpretation of a monu\nment can evolve is provided by one of the most famous and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsame \u201cmessage.\u201d\n  6 For example, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund is a private\n\norganization that obtained funding from over 650,000 donors for the\nconstruction of the memorial itself. These donors expressed a wide\nrange of personal sentiments in contributing money for the memorial.\nSee, e.g., J. Scruggs & J. Swerdlow, To Heal a Nation: The Vietnam\nVeterans Memorial 23\u201328, 159 (1985).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The statue was given to this country by\nthe Third French Republic to express republican solidarity\nand friendship between the two countries. See J. Res. 6,\n44th Cong., 2d Sess. (1877), 19 Stat. 410 (accepting the\nstatue as an \u201cexpressive and felicitous memorial of the\nsympathy of the citizens of our sister Republic\u201d). At the\ninaugural ceremony, President Cleveland saw the statue\nas an emblem of international friendship and the wide\nspread influence of American ideals. See Inauguration of\nthe Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World 30 (1887).\nOnly later did the statue come to be viewed as a beacon\nwelcoming immigrants to a land of freedom. See Public\nPapers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. 2, July 3,\n1986, pp. 918\u2013919 (1989), Remarks at the Opening Cere\nmonies of the Statue of Liberty Centennial Celebration in\nNew York, New York; J. Higham, The Transformation of\nthe Statue of Liberty, in Send These To Me 74\u201380 (rev. ed.\n1984).\n                             C\n   Respondent and the Court of Appeals analogize the\ninstallation of permanent monuments in a public park to\nthe delivery of speeches and the holding of marches and\ndemonstrations, and they thus invoke the rule that a\npublic park is a traditional public forum for these activi\nties. But \u201cpublic forum principles . . . are out of place in\nthe context of this case.\u201d United States v. American Li\nbrary Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 205 (2003). The forum\ndoctrine has been applied in situations in which govern\nment-owned property or a government program was capa\nble of accommodating a large number of public speakers\nwithout defeating the essential function of the land or the\nprogram. For example, a park can accommodate many\nspeakers and, over time, many parades and demonstra\ntions. The Combined Federal Campaign permits hundreds\n16          PLEASANT GROVE CITY v.

A public\nuniversity\u2019s buildings may offer meeting space for hun\ndreds of student groups. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S.\n263, 274\u2013275 (1981).

Public parks have\nbeen used, \u201c \u2018time out of mind, . . . for purposes of assem\nbly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and dis\ncussing public questions,\u2019 \u201d Perry Ed.

They monopolize the use of the\nland on which they stand and interfere permanently with\nother uses of public space. A public park, over the years,\ncan provide a soapbox for a very large number of orators\u2014\noften, for all who want to speak\u2014but it is hard to imagine\nhow a public park could be opened up for the installation\nof permanent monuments by every person or group wish\ning to engage in that form of expression.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

On this view, when\nFrance presented the Statue of Liberty to the United\nStates in 1884, this country had the option of either (a)\ndeclining France\u2019s offer or (b) accepting the gift, but pro\nviding a comparable location in the harbor of New York for\nother statues of a similar size and nature (e.g., a Statue of\nAutocracy, if one had been offered by, say, the German\nEmpire or Imperial Russia).\n   While respondent and some of its amici deride the fears\nexpressed about the consequences of the Court of Appeals\nholding in this case, those concerns are well founded. If\ngovernment entities must maintain viewpoint neutrality\nin their selection of donated monuments, they must either\n\u201cbrace themselves for an influx of clutter\u201d or face the\npressure to remove longstanding and cherished monu\nments. See 499 F. 3d, at 1175 (McConnell, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of rehearing en banc). Every jurisdiction that\nhas accepted a donated war memorial may be asked to\nprovide equal treatment for a donated monument ques\ntioning the cause for which the veterans fought. New\nYork City, having accepted a donated statue of one heroic\ndog (Balto, the sled dog who brought medicine to Nome,\nAlaska, during a diphtheria epidemic)7 may be pressed to\naccept monuments for other dogs who are claimed to be\nequally worthy of commemoration. The obvious truth of\nthe matter is that if public parks were considered to be\ntraditional public forums for the purpose of erecting pri\nvately donated monuments, most parks would have little\nchoice but to refuse all such donations. And where the\napplication of forum analysis would lead almost inexorably\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See NYC Brief 2; App. to Brief for American Catholic Lawyers Asso\n\nciation as Amicus Curiae 1a\u201310.\n18           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto closing of the forum, it is obvious that forum analysis is\nout of place.\n  Respondent compares the present case to Capitol\nSquare Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753\n(1995), but that case involved a very different situation\u2014a\nrequest by a private group, the Ku Klux Klan, to erect a\ncross for a period of 16 days on public property that had\nbeen opened up for similar temporary displays, including a\nChristmas tree and a menorah. See id., at 758. Although\nsome public parks can accommodate and may be made\ngenerally available for temporary private displays, the\nsame is rarely true for permanent monuments.\n  To be sure, there are limited circumstances in which the\nforum doctrine might properly be applied to a permanent\nmonument\u2014for example, if a town created a monument on\nwhich all of its residents (or all those meeting some other\ncriterion) could place the name of a person to be honored\nor some other private message. But as a general matter,\nforum analysis simply does not apply to the installation of\npermanent monuments on public property.\n                              V\n   In sum, we hold that the City\u2019s decision to accept certain\nprivately donated monuments while rejecting respondent\u2019s\nis best viewed as a form of government speech. As a re\nsult, the City\u2019s decision is not subject to the Free Speech\nClause, and the Court of Appeals erred in holding other\nwise. We therefore reverse.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

While I join\nthe Court\u2019s persuasive opinion, I think the reasons justify\ning the city\u2019s refusal would have been equally valid if its\nacceptance of the monument, instead of being character\nized as \u201cgovernment speech,\u201d had merely been deemed an\nimplicit endorsement of the donor\u2019s message. See Capitol\nSquare Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753,\n801\u2013802 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n   To date, our decisions relying on the recently minted\ngovernment speech doctrine to uphold government action\nhave been few and, in my view, of doubtful merit. See,\ne.g., Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U. S. 410 (2006); Johanns v.\nLivestock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550 (2005); Rust v.\nSullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991). The Court\u2019s opinion in this\ncase signals no expansion of that doctrine. And by joining\nthe Court\u2019s opinion, I do not mean to indicate agreement\nwith our earlier decisions. Unlike other decisions relying\non the government speech doctrine, our decision in this\ncase excuses no retaliation for, or coercion of, private\nspeech. Cf. Garcetti, 547 U. S., at 438 (SOUTER, J., dis\nsenting); Rust, 500 U. S., at 212 (Blackmun, J., dissent\ning). Nor is it likely, given the near certainty that observ\n2           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                   STEVENS, J., concurring\n\ners will associate permanent displays with the govern\nmental property owner, that the government will be able\nto avoid political accountability for the views that it en\ndorses or expresses through this means. Cf. Johanns, 544\nU. S., at 571\u2013572 (SOUTER, J., dissenting). Finally, recog\nnizing permanent displays on public property as govern\nment speech will not give the government free license to\ncommunicate offensive or partisan messages. For even if\nthe Free Speech Clause neither restricts nor protects\ngovernment speech, government speakers are bound by\nthe Constitution\u2019s other proscriptions, including those\nsupplied by the Establishment and Equal Protection\nClauses. Together with the checks imposed by our democ\nratic processes, these constitutional safeguards ensure\nthat the effect of today\u2019s decision will be limited.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of that\nquestion and join its opinion in full. But it is also obvious\nthat from the start, the case has been litigated in the\nshadow of the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause:\nthe city wary of associating itself too closely with the Ten\nCommandments monument displayed in the park, lest\nthat be deemed a breach in the so-called \u201cwall of separa\ntion between church and State,\u201d Reynolds v. United States,\n98 U. S. 145, 164 (1879); respondent exploiting that hesi\ntation to argue that the monument is not government\nspeech because the city has not sufficiently \u201cadopted\u201d its\nmessage. Respondent menacingly observed that while the\ncity could have formally adopted the monument as its\nown, that \u201cmight of course raise Establishment Clause\nissues.\u201d Brief for Respondent 34, n. 11.\n   The city ought not fear that today\u2019s victory has propelled\nit from the Free Speech Clause frying pan into the Estab\nlishment Clause fire. Contrary to respondent\u2019s intima\ntions, there are very good reasons to be confident that\nthe park displays do not violate any part of the First\nAmendment.\n2            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\n   In Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677 (2005), this Court\nupheld against Establishment Clause challenge a virtually\nidentical Ten Commandments monument, donated by the\nvery same organization (the Fraternal Order of Eagles),\nwhich was displayed on the grounds surrounding the\nTexas State Capitol. Nothing in that decision suggested\nthat the outcome turned on a finding that the monument\nwas only \u201cprivate\u201d speech. To the contrary, all the Jus\ntices agreed that government speech was at issue, but the\nEstablishment Clause argument was nonetheless rejected.\nFor the plurality, that was because the Ten Command\nments \u201chave an undeniable historical meaning\u201d in addition\nto their \u201creligious significance,\u201d id., at 690 (opinion of\nRehnquist, C. J.). JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in the\njudgment, agreed that the monument conveyed a permis\nsible secular message, as evidenced by its location in a\npark that contained multiple monuments and historical\nmarkers; by the fact that it had been donated by the Ea\ngles \u201cas part of that organization\u2019s efforts to combat juve\nnile delinquency\u201d; and by the length of time (40 years) for\nwhich the monument had gone unchallenged. Id., at 701\u2013\n703. See also id., at 739\u2013740 (SOUTER, J., dissenting).\n   Even accepting the narrowest reading of the narrowest\nopinion necessary to the judgment in Van Orden, there is\nlittle basis to distinguish the monument in this case:\nPioneer Park includes \u201c15 permanent displays,\u201d ante, at 1\u2013\n2; it was donated by the Eagles as part of its national\neffort to combat juvenile delinquency, Brief for Respon\ndent 3; and it was erected in 1971, ibid., which means it is\napproaching its (momentous!) 40th anniversary.\n   The city can safely exhale. Its residents and visitors can\nnow return to enjoying Pioneer Park\u2019s wishing well, its\nhistoric granary\u2014and, yes, even its Ten Commandments\nmonument\u2014without fear that they are complicit in an\nestablishment of religion.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I do so,\nhowever, on the understanding that the \u201cgovernment\nspeech\u201d doctrine is a rule of thumb, not a rigid category.\nWere the City to discriminate in the selection of perma\nnent monuments on grounds unrelated to the display\u2019s\ntheme, say solely on political grounds, its action might\nwell violate the First Amendment.\n    In my view, courts must apply categories such as \u201cgov\nernment speech,\u201d \u201cpublic forums,\u201d \u201climited public forums,\u201d\nand \u201cnonpublic forums\u201d with an eye towards their pur\nposes\u2014lest we turn \u201cfree speech\u201d doctrine into a jurispru\ndence of labels. Cf. United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S.\n720, 740\u2013743 (1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Conse\nquently, we must sometimes look beyond an initial catego\nrization. And, in doing so, it helps to ask whether a gov\nernment action burdens speech disproportionately in light\nof the action\u2019s tendency to further a legitimate government\nobjective.

Rather, the City has simply reserved\nsome space in the park for projects designed to further\nother than free-speech goals. And that is perfectly proper.\nAfter all, parks do not serve speech-related interests\nalone. To the contrary, cities use park space to further a\nvariety of recreational, historical, educational, aesthetic,\nand other civic interests. To reserve to the City the power\nto pick and choose among proposed monuments according\nto criteria reasonably related to one or more of these le\ngitimate ends restricts Summum\u2019s expression, but, given\nthe impracticality of alternatives and viewed in light of\nthe City\u2019s legitimate needs, the restriction is not dispro\nportionate.

SUMMUM\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [February 25, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOUTER, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that the Ten Commandments\nmonument is government speech, that is, an expression of\na government\u2019s position on the moral and religious issues\nraised by the subject of the monument. See Board of\nRegents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S.\n217, 235 (2000) (noting government speech may \u201cpromote\n[government\u2019s] own policies or . . . advance a particular\nidea\u201d). And although the government should lose when\nthe character of the speech is at issue and its governmen\ntal nature has not been made clear, see Johanns v. Live\nstock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550, 577 (2005) (SOUTER,\nJ., dissenting), I also agree with the Court that the city\nneed not satisfy the particular formality urged by Sum\nmum as a condition of recognizing that the expression\nhere falls within the public category. I have qualms,\nhowever, about accepting the position that public monu\nments are government speech categorically. See ante, at 8\n(\u201cJust as government-commissioned and government\nfinanced monuments speak for the government, so do\nprivately financed and donated monuments that the gov\nernment accepts and displays to the public on government\nland\u201d).\n   Because the government speech doctrine, as JUSTICE\nSTEVENS notes, ante, at 1 (concurring opinion), is \u201crecently\n2            PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n               SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nminted,\u201d it would do well for us to go slow in setting its\nbounds, which will affect existing doctrine in ways not yet\nexplored.     Even though, for example, Establishment\nClause issues have been neither raised nor briefed before\nus, there is no doubt that this case and its government\nspeech claim has been litigated by the parties with one eye\non the Establishment Clause, see ante, at 1 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring). The interaction between the \u201cgovernment\nspeech doctrine\u201d and Establishment Clause principles has\nnot, however, begun to be worked out.\n  The case shows that it may not be easy to work out.\nAfter today\u2019s decision, whenever a government maintains\na monument it will presumably be understood to be engag\ning in government speech. If the monument has some\nreligious character, the specter of violating the Establish\nment Clause will behoove it to take care to avoid the ap\npearance of a flat-out establishment of religion, in the\nsense of the government\u2019s adoption of the tenets expressed\nor symbolized. In such an instance, there will be safety in\nnumbers, and it will be in the interest of a careful gov\nernment to accept other monuments to stand nearby, to\ndilute the appearance of adopting whatever particular\nreligious position the single example alone might stand\nfor. As mementoes and testimonials pile up, however, the\nchatter may well make it less intuitively obvious that the\ngovernment is speaking in its own right simply by main\ntaining the monuments.\n  If a case like that occurred, as suspicion grew that some\nof the permanent displays were not government speech at\nall (or at least had an equally private character associated\nwith private donors), a further Establishment Clause\nprohibition would surface, the bar against preferring some\nreligious speakers over others. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\nU. S. 38, 113 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe\nClause was also designed to stop the Federal Government\nfrom asserting a preference for one religious denomination\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n               SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nor sect over others\u201d). But the government could well ar\ngue, as a development of government speech doctrine, that\nwhen it expresses its own views, it is free of the Estab\nlishment Clause\u2019s stricture against discriminating among\nreligious sects or groups. Under this view of the relation\nship between the two doctrines, it would be easy for a\ngovernment to favor some private religious speakers over\nothers by its choice of monuments to accept.\n   Whether that view turns out to be sound is more than I\ncan say at this point. It is simply unclear how the rela\ntively new category of government speech will relate to the\nmore traditional categories of Establishment Clause\nanalysis, and this case is not an occasion to speculate. It\nis an occasion, however, to try to keep the inevitable issues\nopen, and as simple as they can be. One way to do that is\nto recognize that there are circumstances in which gov\nernment maintenance of monuments does not look like\ngovernment speech at all. Sectarian identifications on\nmarkers in Arlington Cemetery come to mind. And to\nrecognize that is to forgo any categorical rule at this point.\n   To avoid relying on a per se rule to say when speech is\ngovernmental, the best approach that occurs to me is to\nask whether a reasonable and fully informed observer\nwould understand the expression to be government\nspeech, as distinct from private speech the government\nchooses to oblige by allowing the monument to be placed\non public land. This reasonable observer test for govern\nmental character is of a piece with the one for spotting\nforbidden governmental endorsement of religion in the\nEstablishment Clause cases. See, e.g., County of Alle\ngheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pitts\nburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 630, 635\u2013636 (1989)\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\nment). The adoption of it would thus serve coherence\nwithin Establishment Clause law, and it would make\nsense of our common understanding that some monu\n4           PLEASANT GROVE CITY v. SUMMUM\n\n              SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nments on public land display religious symbolism that\nclearly does not express a government\u2019s chosen views.\n   Application of this observer test provides the reason I\nfind the monument here to be government expression.\n</pre>",
