S. C. \u00a7921 <i>et seq.,</i> has long prohibited possession of a firearm by any person convicted of a felony. In 1996, Congress extended the prohibition to include persons convicted of \"a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" \u00a7922(g)(9). The definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" contained in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), is at issue in this case. Does that term cover a misdemeanor battery whenever the battered victim was in fact the offender's spouse (or other relation specified in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A))? Or, to trigger the possession ban, must the predicate misdemeanor identify as an element of the crime a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim? We hold that the domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a \u00a7922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense.</p> <p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 2004, law enforcement officers in Marion County, West Virginia, came to the home of Randy Edward Hayes in response to a 911 call reporting domestic violence. Hayes consented to a search of his home, and the officers discovered a rifle. Further investigation revealed that Hayes had recently possessed several other firearms as well. Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury returned an indictment in 2005, charging Hayes, under \u00a7\u00a7922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2), with three counts of possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>The indictment identified Hayes's predicate misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as a 1994 conviction for battery in violation of West Virginia law.<sup>[1]</sup> The victim of that battery, the indictment alleged, was Hayes's then-wife \u0097a person who \"shared a child in common\" with Hayes and \"who was cohabitating with . . . him as a spouse.\" App. 3.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Asserting that his 1994 West Virginia battery conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under \u00a7922(g)(9), Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment. Section 922(g)(9), Hayes maintained, applies only to persons previously convicted of an offense that has as an element a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim. The West Virginia statute under which he was convicted in 1994, Hayes observed, was a generic battery proscription, not a law designating a domestic relationship between offender and victim as an element of the offense. The United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia rejected Hayes's argument and denied his motion to dismiss the indictment. 377 F. Supp. 2d 540, 541-542 (2005). Hayes then entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed.</p>\n<p>In a 2-to-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. A \u00a7922(g)(9) predicate offense, the Court of Appeals held, must \"have as an element a domestic relationship between the offender and the victim.\" 482 F. 3d 749, 751 (2007). In so ruling, the Fourth Circuit created a split between itself and the nine other Courts of Appeals that had previously published opinions deciding the same question.<sup>[3]</sup> According to those courts, \u00a7922(g)(9) does not require that the offense predicate to the defendant's firearm possession conviction have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and victim. We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), to resolve this conflict.</p> <p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Section 922(g)(9) makes it \"unlawful for any person . . . who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence . . . [to] possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\" Section 921(a)(33)(A) defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he term `misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' means an offense that\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim\" (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>This definition, all agree, imposes two requirements: First, a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" must have, \"as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" Second, it must be \"committed by\" a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim. The question here is whether the language of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) calls for a further limitation: Must the statute describing the predicate offense include, as a discrete element, the existence of a domestic relationship between offender and victim? In line with the large majority of the Courts of Appeals, we conclude that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) does not require a predicate-offense statute of that specificity. Instead, in a \u00a7922(g)(9) prosecution, it suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for \"an offense. . . committed by\" the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim.</p>\n<p>We note as an initial matter that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) uses the word \"element\" in the singular, which suggests that Congress intended to describe only one required element. Immediately following the word \"element,\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the use of force (undoubtedly a required element) and thereafter to the relationship between aggressor and victim, <i>e.g.,</i> a current or former spouse. The manner in which the offender acts, and the offender's relationship with the victim, are \"conceptually distinct attributes.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Meade,</i> 175 F. 3d 215, 218 (CA1 1999).<sup>[4]</sup> Had Congress meant to make the latter as well as the former an element of the predicate offense, it likely would have used the plural \"elements,\" as it has done in other offense-defining provisions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(c)(2)(A) (\"[T]he term `assault with intent to commit rape' means an offense that has as its elements engaging in physical contact with another person or using or brandishing a weapon against another person with intent to commit aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse.\"). Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 559 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \"element\" as \"[a] constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed \").<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Treating the relationship between aggressor and victim as an element of the predicate offense is also awkward as a matter of syntax. It requires the reader to regard \"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\" as an expression modified by the relative clause \"committed by.\" In ordinary usage, however, we would not say that a person \"commit[s]\" a \"use.\" It is more natural to say that a person \"commit[s]\" an \"offense.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Belless,</i> 338 F. 3d 1063, 1066 (CA9 2003) (\"One can `commit' a crime or an offense, but one does not `commit' `force' or `use.'\").</p>\n<p>In reaching the conclusion that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) renders both the use of force and a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim necessary elements of a qualifying predicate offense, the Fourth Circuit majority relied on two textual arguments. First, the court noted that clause (ii) is separated from clause (i) by a line break and a semicolon; in contrast, the components of clause (ii)\u0097force and domestic relationship\u0097are joined in an unbroken word flow. See 482 F. 3d, at 753.</p>\n<p>Had Congress placed the \"committed by\" phrase in its own clause, set off from clause (ii) by a semicolon or a line break, the lawmakers might have better conveyed that \"committed by\" modifies only \"offense\" and not \"use\" or \"element.\" Congress' less-than-meticulous drafting, however, hardly shows that the legislators meant to exclude from \u00a7922(g)(9)'s firearm possession prohibition domestic abusers convicted under generic assault or battery provisions.</p>\n<p>As structured, \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" by addressing in clause (i) the meaning of \"misdemeanor\" and, in turn, in clause (ii), \"crime of domestic violence.\" Because a \"crime of domestic violence\" involves both a use of force and a domestic relationship, joining these features together in clause (ii) would make sense even if Congress had no design to confine laws qualifying under \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to those designating as elements both use of force and domestic relationship between aggressor and victim. See <i>id.,</i> at 761 (Williams, J., dissenting). See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d 1354, 1358-1360, 1361 (CADC 2002) (\"The fact that the Congress somewhat awkwardly included the `committed by' phrase in subpart (ii) (instead of adding a subpart (iii)) is not significant in view of the <i>un</i>natural reading that would result if `committed by' were construed to modify `use of force.'\").</p>\n<p>A related statutory provision, 25 U. S. C. \u00a72803(3)(C), indicates that Congress did not ascribe substantive significance to the placement of line breaks and semicolons in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A). In 2006, Congress amended \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(i) to include misdemeanors under \"[t]ribal law\" as predicate offenses. As a companion measure, Congress simultaneously enacted \u00a72803(3)(C), which employs use-of-force and domestic-relationship language virtually identical to the language earlier placed in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(i), except that \u00a72803(3)(C) uses no semicolon or line break.</p>\n<p>Section 2803(3)(C) authorizes federal agents to \"make an arrest without a warrant for an offense committed in Indian country if\u0097\"</p>\n<blockquote>\"the offense is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. . . and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent or guardian of the victim. . . .\"</blockquote>\n<p>At the time Congress enacted \u00a72803(3)(C), the Courts of Appeals uniformly agreed that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) did not limit predicate offenses to statutory texts specifying both a use of force and a domestic relationship as offense elements. Congress presumably knew how \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) had been construed, and presumably intended \u00a72803(3)(C) to bear the same meaning. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</i> v. <i>Dabit,</i> 547 U. S. 71, 85-86 (2006) (\"[W]hen `judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial interpretations as well.'\" (quoting <i>Bragdon</i> v. <i>Abbott,</i> 524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998))). Relying on spacing and punctuation to hem in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), while reading \u00a72803(3)(C) to contain no similar limitation, would create a disjunction between these two provisions that Congress could not have intended.</p>\n<p>As a second justification for its construction of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), the Court of Appeals invoked the \"rule of the last antecedent,\" under which \"a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\" <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). The words \"committed by\" immediately follow the use-of-force language, the court observed, and therefore should be read to modify that phrase, not the earlier word \"offense.\" See 482 F. 3d, at 753-755. The rule of the last antecedent, however, \"is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\" <i>Barnhart,</i> 540 U. S., at 26.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Applying the rule of the last antecedent here would require us to accept two unlikely premises: that Congress employed the singular \"element\" to encompass two distinct concepts, and that it adopted the awkward construction \"commi[t]\" a \"use.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 5-6. Moreover, as the dissent acknowledges, <i>post,</i> at 4, the last-antecedent rule would render the word \"committed\" superfluous: Congress could have conveyed the same meaning by referring simply to \"the use . . . of physical force . . . by a current or former spouse . . . .\" See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29. \"Committed\" retains its operative meaning only if it is read to modify \"offense.\"</p>\n<p>Most sensibly read, then, \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as a misdemeanor offense that (1) \"has, as an element, the use [of force],\" and (2) is committed by a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim. To obtain a conviction in a \u00a7922(g)(9) prosecution, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim of the predicate offense was the defendant's current or former spouse or was related to the defendant in another specified way. But that relationship, while it must be established, need not be denominated an element of the predicate offense.<sup>[7]</sup></p> <p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Practical considerations strongly support our reading of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)'s language. Existing felon-in-possession laws, Congress recognized, were not keeping firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, because \"many people who engage in serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of felonies.\" 142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996) (statement of Sen. Lautenberg). By extending the federal firearm prohibition to persons convicted of \"misdemeanor crime[s] of domestic violence,\" proponents of \u00a7922(g)(9) sought to \"close this dangerous loophole.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 22986.</p>\n<p>Construing \u00a7922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute (one that does not designate a domestic relationship as an element of the offense) would frustrate Congress' manifest purpose. Firearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination nationwide. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-15; Brief for National Network to End Domestic Violence et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 2-8. Yet, as interpreted by the Fourth Circuit, \u00a7922(g)(9) would have been \"a dead letter\" in some two-thirds of the States from the very moment of its enactment. 482 F. 3d, at 762 (Williams, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>As of 1996, only about one-third of the States had criminal statutes that specifically proscribed <i>domestic</i> violence. See Brief for United States 23, n. 8.<sup>[8]</sup> Even in those States, domestic abusers were (and are) routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault or battery laws. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. And no statute defining a distinct federal misdemeanor designated as an element of the offense a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim. Yet Congress defined \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" to include \"misdemeanor[s] under Federal . . . law.\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(i). Given the paucity of state and federal statutes targeting <i>domestic</i> violence, we find it highly improbable that Congress meant to extend \u00a7922(g)(9)'s firearm possession ban only to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense. See <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d, at 1364 (rejecting the view that \"Congress remedied one disparity\u0097between felony and misdemeanor domestic violence convictions\u0097while at the same time creating a new disparity among (and sometimes, within) states\").<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The measure that became \u00a7922(g)(9) and \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), Hayes acknowledges, initially may have had a broadly remedial purpose, see Brief for Respondent 28-29, but the text of the proposal, he maintains, was revised and narrowed while the measure remained in the congressional hopper. The compromise reflected in the text that gained passage, Hayes argues, restricted the legislation to offenses specifically denominating a domestic relationship as a defining element. The changes Hayes identifies, however, do not corroborate his argument.</p>\n<p>Congress did revise the language of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to spell out the use-of-force requirement. The proposed legislation initially described the predicate domestic-violence offense as a \"crime of violence . . . committed by\" a person who had a domestic relationship with the victim. 142 Cong. Rec. 5840. The final version replaced the unelaborated phrase \"crime of violence\" with the phrase \"has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" This apparently last-minute insertion may help to explain some of the syntactical awkwardness of the enacted language, but it does not evince an intention to convert the \"committed by\" phrase into a required element of the predicate offense.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in a floor statement discussing the revised version of \u00a7922(g)(9), Senator Frank Lautenberg, the sponsor of the provision, observed that a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim often would not be a designated element of the predicate offense:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[C]onvictions for domestic violence-related crimes often are for crimes, such as assault, that are not explicitly identified as related to domestic violence. Therefore, it will not always be possible for law enforcement authorities to determine from the face of someone's criminal record whether a particular misdemeanor conviction involves domestic violence, as defined in the new law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 26675.</blockquote>\n<p>The remarks of a single Senator are \"not controlling,\" <i>Consumer Product Safety Comm'n</i> v. <i>GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 447 U. S. 102, 118 (1980), but, as Hayes recognizes, the legislative record is otherwise \"absolutely silent.\" See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 35. It contains no suggestion that Congress intended to confine \u00a7922(g)(9) to abusers who had violated statutes rendering the domestic relationship between aggressor and victim an element of the offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The rule of lenity, Hayes contends, provides an additional reason to construe \u00a7922(g)(9) and \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to apply only to predicate offenses that specify a domestic relationship as an element of the crime. \"[T]he touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.\" <i>Bifulco</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). We apply the rule \"only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Shabani,</i> 513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994). Section 921(a)(33)(A)'s definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" we acknowledge, is not a model of the careful drafter's art. See <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d, at 1356. But neither is it \"grievous[ly] ambigu[ous].\" <i>Huddleston</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 415 U. S. 814, 831 (1974). The text, context, purpose, and what little there is of drafting history all point in the same direction: Congress defined \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" to include an offense \"committed by\" a person who had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship as an element of the crime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>A person convicted of a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" is prohibited from possessing a firearm. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9). The question before the Court is whether the definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) includes misdemeanor offenses with no domestic-relationship element.</p>\n<p>Section 921(a)(33)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he term `misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' means an offense that\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.\" (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p>The majority would read the \"committed by\" phrase in clause (ii) to modify the word \"offense\" in the opening clause of subparagraph (A), leapfrogging the word \"element\" at the outset of clause (ii). That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would therefore be subject to prosecution under \u00a7922(g)(9).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held to the contrary that \"committed by\" modifies the immediately preceding phrase: \"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A); 482 F. 3d 749, 753-754 (CA4 2007). Read that way, a domestic relationship is an element of the prior offense.</p>\n<p>That seems to be the most natural reading right off the bat. The term at issue is \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" That is a defined term\u0097so the definition certainly must be parsed\u0097but it would be at least surprising to find from that parsing that a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" need not by its terms have anything to do with domestic violence.</p>\n<p>1. The grammatical rule of the last antecedent indicates that the domestic relationship is a required element of the predicate offense. That rule instructs that \"a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\" <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). Pursuant to that rule, the \"committed by\" phrase in clause (ii) is best read to modify the preceding phrase \"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" See 482 F. 3d, at 754-755. By not following the usual grammatical rule, the majority's reading requires jumping over two line breaks, clause (i), a semicolon, and the first portion of clause (ii) to reach the more distant antecedent (\"offense\"). Due to the floating \"that\" after \"offense,\" if \"committed by\" modified \"offense\" the text would read \"offense that committed by.\"</p>\n<p>The majority counters that people do not ordinarily say someone \"commit[s]\" a \"use\" of force. See <i>ante,</i> at 6. True enough, but only because \"use\" of force is a term that encompasses a variety of conduct, which if listed separately would not pose the objection the majority raises (<i>e.g.,</i> commits a battery, robbery, or kidnaping). There is no reason to believe that the reasonable drafting decision to insert \"use\" of force rather than coming up with a laundry list of offenses was meant to alter the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p>The majority also relies on Congress's use of the word \"element\" in the singular. From that, the majority infers that Congress intended to describe only one required element\u0097the use of force. <i>Ante,</i> at 5. In its view, Congress would have used the plural \"elements\" if it meant to encompass both the use of force and the offender's relationship with the victim. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>That argument is contrary to the Dictionary Act, which specifies that unless the context indicates otherwise, \"words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things.\" 1 U. S. C. \u00a71; see <i>Rowland</i> v. <i>California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council,</i> 506 U. S. 194, 200 (1993). More significantly, reading \"element\" as limited to the singular does not resolve what that element is. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d 1354, 1369 (CADC 2002) (Sentelle, J., dissenting). A single element often contains multiple components. In the very provision at issue, the \"threatened use of a deadly weapon\" includes three concepts: (1) the threatened use (2) of a weapon (3) that is deadly.</p>\n<p>In other statutes, Congress has used the word \"element\" in the singular to refer to the use of force and its object. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) (defining \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\"). The majority finds it \"unsurprising\" that Congress would have chosen to combine the mode of aggression and its object in a \"single, undifferentiated element.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 5, n. 4. It asserts, however, that Congress would not have so joined the use of force and the offender's relationship with the victim, because those requirements \"are not readily conceptualized as a single element.\" <i>Ibid.</i> That distinction is elusive; both 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) and the provision at issue here contain as distinct components the act (use of force) and the target (person or property in the former case, domestic relationship victim in the latter).</p>\n<p>The majority also points out that interpreting \"committed by\" to modify the \"use\" of force would render the word \"committed\" superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading \"committed by\" to modify \"offense\" has its own flaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading. The majority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the statutory language reflects \"less-than-meticulous drafting\" and \"syntactical awkwardness,\" and \"is not a model of the careful drafter's art.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 6, 12, 13. I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous.</p>\n<p>2. That brings us to the structure of the statute. The most natural reading of the statute, as it is laid out, is that the underlying misdemeanor must have as an element the use of force committed by a person in a domestic relationship with the victim. The definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" is twice qualified: first, by the relative clause \"is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law\"; and second by the relative clause \"has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by [a person in a specified domestic relationship with the victim].\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (footnote omitted). The fact that Congress included the domestic relationship language in the clause of the statute designating the element of the predicate offense strongly suggests that it is in fact part of the required element.</p>\n<p>The majority's contrary reading requires restructuring the statute and adding words. The majority first must place the \"committed by\" phrase in its own clause\u0097set off by a line break, a semicolon, or \"(iii)\"\u0097to indicate that \"committed by\" refers all the way back to \"offense.\" And, as noted, because the word \"that\" appears at the end of subparagraph (A), the statute would then read \"an offense that committed by.\" To arrive at its reading, the majority must ignore the floating \"that\" or add \"and is\" before \"committed by.\"</p>\n<p>The Government would define \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as \"an offense, committed by a person with a domestic relationship with the victim, that is a misdemeanor and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" Brief for United States 13; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9. That reading also requires rearranging the statute. The \"committed by\" phrase would have to be severed from clause (ii) and moved up to appear after the word \"offense\" in subparagraph (A). Changing and rearranging the wording as the Government does to explain what the actual words mean is, in any event, not a compelling line of argument.</p>\n<p>The majority attempts to diminish the magnitude of these alterations by stating that the lawmakers might have better conveyed their intent by setting off the \"committed by\" phrase with \"a semicolon\" or \"a line break.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 6. But those are not insignificant revisions; they alter the structure of the statute, and we have recognized that structure is often critical in resolving verbal ambiguity. See <i>Castillo</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 530 U. S. 120, 124 (2000) (\"The statute's structure clarifies any ambiguity inherent in its literal language\"). I therefore respectfully disagree with the majority that \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" is most sensibly read as including misdemeanor offenses without a domestic-relationship element.</p>\n<p>3. Moving beyond text and structure, the majority recognizes that there is \"little . . . drafting history,\" <i>ante,</i> at 13, but gamely trots out what there is: a statement on the floor of the Senate by the bill's sponsor, see <i>ante,</i> at 12. Such tidbits do not amount to much. See <i>Consumer Product Safety Comm'n</i> v. <i>GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 447 U. S. 102, 118 (1980). This is especially true here where the statement was delivered the day the legislation was passed and <i>after</i> the House of Representatives had passed the pertinent provision. See <i>Exxon Mobil Corp.</i> v. <i>Allapattah Services, Inc.,</i> 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005); see also Brief for Respondent 33. The majority nonetheless looks to the floor statement because \"the legislative record is otherwise `absolutely silent.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 12. But that is no reason to accord the statement significance: We dismiss the value of such statements due to their inherent flaws as guides to legislative intent, flaws that persist (and indeed may be amplified) in the absence of other indicia of intent.</p>\n<p>The majority also finds it \"highly improbable that Congress meant to extend \u00a7922(g)(9)'s firearm possession ban only to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 11. In its view, construing \u00a7922(g)(9) to exclude persons convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would \"frustrate Congress' manifest purpose,\" <i>ante,</i> at 10, of keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. See <i>ante,</i> at 10 (quoting statement of Sen. Lautenberg, 142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996)).</p>\n<p>Invoking the <i>sponsor's</i> objective as <i>Congress's</i> manifest purpose, however, \"ignores the complexity of the problems Congress is called upon to address and the dynamics of legislative action.\" <i>Board of Governors, FRS</i> v. <i>Dimension Financial Corp.,</i> 474 U. S. 361, 373-374 (1986). Legislative enactments are the result of negotiations between competing interests; \"the final language of the legislation may reflect hard-fought compromises.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 374. Even if there were sufficient sentiment to extend the gun ban, individual legislators might have disagreed on the appropriate reach of the new provision. See <i>ibid.</i> Some members might well have been willing to extend the ban beyond individuals convicted of felonies, but only if the predicate misdemeanor by its terms was addressed to domestic violence.</p>\n<p>4. The majority's approach will entail significant problems in application. Under the interpretation adopted by the court below, it is easy to determine whether an individual is covered by the gun ban: Simply look to the record of the prior conviction. Under the majority's approach, on the other hand, it will often be necessary to go beyond the fact of conviction and \"engage in an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant's prior offens[e],\" <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 495 U. S. 575, 601 (1990), to determine whether it happened to involve domestic violence.</p>\n<p>That is one reason we adopted a categorical approach to predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1), \"looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 600; see <i>Shepard</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 544 U. S. 13, 19 (2005) (Court considered \"predicate offens[e] in terms not of prior conduct but of prior `convictions' and the `element[s]' of crimes\"). As we warned in <i>Taylor</i> and reaffirmed in <i>Shepard,</i> \"the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach are daunting.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 601; see <i>Shepard, supra,</i> at 20. Those same concerns are implicated here, given that the majority would require juries and courts to look at the particular facts of a prior conviction to determine whether it happened to involve domestic violence, rather than simply looking to the elements of the predicate offense. See <i>ante,</i> at 4-5.</p>\n<p>5. Taking a fair view, the text of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) is ambiguous, the structure leans in the defendant's favor, the purpose leans in the Government's favor, and the legislative history does not amount to much. This is a textbook case for application of the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p>\"Because construction of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for fair warning, it is rare that legislative history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statute broader than that clearly warranted by the text.\" <i>Crandon</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 494 U. S. 152, 160 (1990). It cannot fairly be said here that the text \"clearly warrants\" the counterintuitive conclusion that a \"crime of domestic violence\" need not have domestic violence as an element. That leaves the majority's arguments about legislative history and statutory purpose. This is not the \"rare\" case in which such grounds provide \"fair warning,\" especially given that there is nothing wrong with the conduct punished\u0097possessing a firearm\u0097if the prior misdemeanor is not covered by the statute.</p>\n<p>If the rule of lenity means anything, it is that an individual should not go to jail for failing to conduct a 50-state survey or comb through obscure legislative history. Ten years in jail is too much to hinge on the will-o'-the-wisp of statutory meaning pursued by the majority.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[1]  West Virginia's battery statute provides: \"[A]ny person [who] unlawfully and intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another or unlawfully and intentionally causes physical harm to another person, . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\" W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a761-2-9(c) (Lexis 2005).</p>\n<p>[2]  The indictment stated, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>\"Defendant RANDY EDWARD HAYES' February 24, 1994 Battery conviction . . . constituted a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because:</p>\n<p>\"a.

See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) (defining \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\"). Although one might conceive of an action and its object as separate elements, it is unsurprising that Congress would have chosen to denominate \"the use of force against another\" as a single, undifferentiated element. In contrast, the two requirements set out in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\u0097the use of force and the existence of a specified relationship between aggressor and victim\u0097are not readily conceptualized as a single element.</p>\n<p>[5]  Invoking the Dictionary Act, Hayes contends that the singular \"element\" encompasses the plural \"elements.\" See Brief for Respondent 25. The Dictionary Act provides that, \"unless the context indicates otherwise,\" \"words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things.\" 1 U. S. C. \u00a71. On the rare occasions when we have relied on this rule, doing so was \"necessary to carry out the evident intent of the statute.\" <i>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis</i> v. <i>Missouri,</i> 263 U. S. 640, 657 (1924). As we explain <i>infra,</i> at 10-12, Hayes's reading of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) does not accord with Congress' aim in extending the gun possession ban.</p>\n<p>[6]  As the United States points out, the Court of Appeals \"itself recognized the flexibility of the rule [of the last antecedent].\" Brief for United States 20, n. 7. Under a strict application of the rule, the \"committed by\" phrase would modify only its immediate antecedent, <i>i.e.,</i> \"the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\" and not the entire phrase \"use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" The court rightly regarded such a reading as implausible. See 482 F. 3d 749, 755 (CA4 2007).</p>\n<p>[7]  We find it not at all \"surprising\"\u0097indeed, it seems to us \"most natural\" \u0097to read \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to convey that a person convicted of battering a spouse or other domestic victim has committed a \"crime of domestic violence,\" whether or not the statute of conviction happens to contain a domestic-relationship element. Cf. <i>post,</i> at 2.</p>\n<p>[8]  Additional States have enacted such statutes since 1996, but about one-half of the States still prosecute domestic violence exclusively under generally applicable criminal laws. See Brief for United States 23-24, and n. 9.</p>\n<p>[9]  Generally, as in this case, it would entail no \"`elaborate factfinding process,'\" cf. <i>post,</i> at 7, to determine whether the victim of a violent assault was the perpetrator's \"current or former spouse\" or bore one of the other domestic relationships specified in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) to the perpetrator.</p>\n\n</div>",

HAYES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 07\u2013608.      Argued November 10, 2008\u2014Decided February 24, 2009\nIn 1996, Congress extended the federal Gun Control Act of 1968\u2019s pro\n  hibition on possession of a firearm by convicted felons to include per\n  sons convicted of \u201ca misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9). Responding to a 911 call reporting domestic vio\n  lence, police officers discovered a rifle in respondent Hayes\u2019s home.\n  Based on this and other evidence, Hayes was charged under\n  \u00a7\u00a7922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2) with possessing firearms after having been\n  convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The indict\n  ment identified as the predicate misdemeanor offense Hayes\u2019s 1994\n  conviction for battery against his then-wife, in violation of West Vir\n  ginia law. Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that\n  his 1994 conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under\n  \u00a7922(g)(9) because West Virginia\u2019s generic battery law did not desig\n  nate a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim as an\n  element of the offense. When the District Court denied the motion,\n  Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed. The Fourth\n  Circuit reversed, holding that a \u00a7922(g)(9) predicate offense must\n  have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and vic\n  tim.\nHeld: A domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a\n reasonable doubt in a \u00a7922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution,\n need not be a defining element of the predicate offense. Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) The definition of \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d con\n tained in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), imposes two requirements. First, the crime\n must have, \u201cas an element, the use or attempted use of physical force,\n or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii). Sec\n ond, it must be \u201ccommitted by\u201d a person who has a specified domestic\n relationship with the victim. Ibid. The definition does not, however,\n2                      UNITED STATES v. HAYES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    require the predicate-offense statute to include, as an element, the\n    existence of that domestic relationship. Instead, it suffices for the\n    Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact,\n    for \u201can offense . . . committed by\u201d the defendant against a spouse or\n    other domestic victim. Pp. 4\u20139.\n         (1) As an initial matter, \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)\u2019s use of the singular word\n    \u201celement\u201d suggests that Congress intended to describe only one re\n    quired element, the use of force. Had Congress also meant to make\n    the specified relationship a predicate-offense element, it likely would\n    have used the plural \u201celements,\u201d as it has done in other offense\n    defining provisions. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(c)(2)(A). Treating the\n    specified relationship as a predicate-offense element is also awkward\n    as a matter of syntax. It requires the reader to regard \u201cthe use or at\n    tempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly\n    weapon\u201d as an expression modified by the relative clause \u201ccommitted\n    by.\u201d It is more natural, however, to say a person \u201ccommit[s]\u201d an \u201cof\n    fense\u201d than to say one \u201ccommit[s]\u201d a \u201cuse.\u201d Pp. 5\u20136.\n         (2) The Fourth Circuit\u2019s textual arguments to the contrary are\n    unpersuasive. First, that court noted, clause (ii) is separated from\n    clause (i)\u2014which defines \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d\u2014by a line break and a\n    semicolon, while clause (ii)\u2019s components\u2014force and domestic rela\n    tionship\u2014are joined in an unbroken word flow. Such less-than\n    meticulous drafting hardly shows that Congress meant to exclude\n    from \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s prohibition domestic abusers convicted under ge\n    neric assault or battery laws. As structured, \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) defines\n    \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d by addressing in clause (i)\n    the meaning of \u201cmisdemeanor,\u201d and in clause (ii) \u201ccrime of domestic\n    violence.\u201d Because a \u201ccrime of domestic violence\u201d involves both a use\n    of force and a domestic relationship, joining these features together\n    in clause (ii) would make sense even if Congress had no design to con\n    fine laws qualifying under \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to those designating as\n    elements both use of force and domestic relationship. A related\n    statutory provision, 25 U. S. C. \u00a72803(3)(C), indicates that Congress\n    did not ascribe substantive significance to the placement of line\n    breaks and semicolons in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A). Second, the\n    Fourth Circuit relied on the \u201crule of the last antecedent\u201d to read\n    \u201ccommitted by\u201d as modifying the immediately preceding use-of-force\n    phrase rather than the earlier word \u201coffense.\u201d The last-antecedent\n    rule, however, \u201cis not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by\n    other indicia of meaning.\u201d Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26.\n    Applying the rule here would require the Court to accept the unlikely\n    premises that Congress employed the singular \u201celement\u201d to encom\n    pass two distinct concepts, and that it adopted the awkward con\n    struction \u201ccommi[t]\u201d a use. The rule, moreover, would render the\n                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  word \u201ccommitted\u201d superfluous, for Congress could have conveyed the\n  same meaning by referring simply to \u201cthe use . . . of physical force . . .\n  by a current or former spouse . . . .\u201d Pp. 6\u20139.\n     (b) Practical considerations strongly support this Court\u2019s reading of\n  \u00a7921(a)(33)(A). By extending the federal firearm prohibition to per\n  sons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence,\n  \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s proponents sought to close a loophole: Existing felon-in\n  possession laws often failed to keep firearms out of the hands of do\n  mestic abusers, for such offenders generally were not charged with,\n  or convicted of, felonies. Construing \u00a7922(g)(9) to exclude the domes\n  tic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would frus\n  trate Congress\u2019 manifest purpose. The statute would have been a\n  dead letter in some two-thirds of the States because, in 1996, only\n  about one-third of them had criminal statutes specifically proscribing\n  domestic violence. Hayes argues that the measure that became\n  \u00a7\u00a7922(g)(9) and 921(a)(33)(A), though it initially may have had a\n  broadly remedial purpose, was revised and narrowed during the leg\n  islative process, but his argument is not corroborated by the revisions\n  he identifies. Indeed, \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s Senate sponsor observed that a\n  domestic relationship often would not be a designated element of the\n  predicate offense. Such remarks are \u201cnot controlling,\u201d Consumer\n  Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118, but\n  the legislative record is otherwise silent. Pp. 10\u201312.\n     (c) The rule of lenity, on which Hayes also relies, applies only when\n  a statute is ambiguous. Section 921(a)(33)(A)\u2019s definition, though not\n  a model of the careful drafter\u2019s art, is also not \u201cgrievous[ly] am\n  bigu[ous].\u201d Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 831. The\n  text, context, purpose, and what little drafting history there is all\n  point in the same direction: Congress defined \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\n  domestic violence\u201d to include an offense \u201ccommitted by\u201d a person who\n  had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not\n  the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship\n  as an element of the crime.

In 1996, Congress extended\nthe prohibition to include persons convicted of \u201ca misde\nmeanor crime of domestic violence.\u201d \u00a7922(g)(9). The\ndefinition of \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\u201d\ncontained in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), is at issue in this case. Does\nthat term cover a misdemeanor battery whenever the\nbattered victim was in fact the offender\u2019s spouse (or other\nrelation specified in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A))?

Further investigation revealed that\nHayes had recently possessed several other firearms as\nwell. Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury re\nturned an indictment in 2005, charging Hayes, under\n\u00a7\u00a7922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2), with three counts of possessing\nfirearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence.\n   The indictment identified Hayes\u2019s predicate misde\nmeanor crime of domestic violence as a 1994 conviction for\nbattery in violation of West Virginia law.1 The victim of\nthat battery, the indictment alleged, was Hayes\u2019s then\nwife\u2014a person who \u201cshared a child in common\u201d with\nHayes and \u201cwho was cohabitating with . . . him as a\nspouse.\u201d App. 3.2\n   Asserting that his 1994 West Virginia battery conviction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 West\n         Virginia\u2019s battery statute provides: \u201c[A]ny person [who] unlaw\nfully and intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or pro\nvoking nature with the person of another or unlawfully and intention\nally causes physical harm to another person, . . . shall be guilty of a\nmisdemeanor.\u201d W.

Section 922(g)(9),\nHayes maintained, applies only to persons previously\nconvicted of an offense that has as an element a domestic\nrelationship between aggressor and victim. The West\nVirginia statute under which he was convicted in 1994,\nHayes observed, was a generic battery proscription, not a\nlaw designating a domestic relationship between offender\nand victim as an element of the offense. The United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of West\nVirginia rejected Hayes\u2019s argument and denied his motion\nto dismiss the indictment. 377 F. Supp. 2d 540, 541\u2013542\n(2005). Hayes then entered a conditional guilty plea and\nappealed.\n  In a 2-to-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit reversed. A \u00a7922(g)(9) predicate\noffense, the Court of Appeals held, must \u201chave as an ele\nment a domestic relationship between the offender and the\nvictim.\u201d 482 F. 3d 749, 751 (2007). In so ruling, the\nFourth Circuit created a split between itself and the nine\nother Courts of Appeals that had previously published\nopinions deciding the same question.3 According to those\ncourts, \u00a7922(g)(9) does not require that the offense predi\ncate to the defendant\u2019s firearm possession conviction have\nas an element a domestic relationship between offender\nand victim.

[to] possess in or affecting\ncommerce, any firearm or ammunition.\u201d                Section\n921(a)(33)(A) defines \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence\u201d as follows:\n    \u201c[T]he term \u2018misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u2019\n    means an offense that\u2014\n      \u201c(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or\n    Tribal law; and\n      \u201c(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of\n    physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly\n    weapon, committed by a current or former spouse,\n    parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with\n    whom the victim shares a child in common, by a per\n    son who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with\n    the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a\n    person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or\n    guardian of the victim\u201d (footnotes omitted).\n   This definition, all agree, imposes two requirements:\nFirst, a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d must\nhave, \u201cas an element, the use or attempted use of physical\nforce, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\u201d Second,\nit must be \u201ccommitted by\u201d a person who has a specified\ndomestic relationship with the victim. The question here\nis whether the language of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) calls for a fur\nther limitation: Must the statute describing the predicate\noffense include, as a discrete element, the existence of a\ndomestic relationship between offender and victim? In\nline with the large majority of the Courts of Appeals, we\nconclude that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) does not require a predicate\noffense statute of that specificity. Instead, in a \u00a7922(g)(9)\nprosecution, it suffices for the Government to charge and\nprove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for \u201can offense\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

The manner in which the offender acts, and the\noffender\u2019s relationship with the victim, are \u201cconceptually\ndistinct attributes.\u201d United States v. Meade, 175 F. 3d\n215, 218 (CA1 1999).4 Had Congress meant to make the\nlatter as well as the former an element of the predicate\noffense, it likely would have used the plural \u201celements,\u201d as\nit has done in other offense-defining provisions. See, e.g.,\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(c)(2)(A) (\u201c[T]he term \u2018assault with intent\nto commit rape\u2019 means an offense that has as its elements\nengaging in physical contact with another person or using\nor brandishing a weapon against another person with\nintent to commit aggravated sexual abuse or sexual\nabuse.\u201d). Cf. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 559 (8th ed. 2004)\n(defining \u201celement\u201d as \u201c[a] constituent part of a claim that\nmust be proved for the claim to succeed <Burke failed to\nprove the element of proximate cause in prosecuting his\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Hayes observes, see Brief for Respondent 24\u201325, that Congress has\n\nused the singular \u201celement\u201d in defining a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to require\nboth an action (the use of force) and its object (the person of another).\nSee, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense\nthat has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person or property of another\u201d). Although\none might conceive of an action and its object as separate elements, it is\nunsurprising that Congress would have chosen to denominate \u201cthe use\nof force against another\u201d as a single, undifferentiated element. In\ncontrast, the two requirements set out in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\u2014the use of\nforce and the existence of a specified relationship between aggressor\nand victim\u2014are not readily conceptualized as a single element.\n6                    UNITED STATES v. HAYES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnegligence claim>\u201d).5\n   Treating the relationship between aggressor and victim\nas an element of the predicate offense is also awkward as\na matter of syntax. It requires the reader to regard \u201cthe\nuse or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened\nuse of a deadly weapon\u201d as an expression modified by the\nrelative clause \u201ccommitted by.\u201d In ordinary usage, how\never, we would not say that a person \u201ccommit[s]\u201d a \u201cuse.\u201d\nIt is more natural to say that a person \u201ccommit[s]\u201d an\n\u201coffense.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Belless, 338 F. 3d\n1063, 1066 (CA9 2003) (\u201cOne can \u2018commit\u2019 a crime or an\noffense, but one does not \u2018commit\u2019 \u2018force\u2019 or \u2018use.\u2019 \u201d).\n   In reaching the conclusion that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) renders\nboth the use of force and a domestic relationship between\naggressor and victim necessary elements of a qualifying\npredicate offense, the Fourth Circuit majority relied on\ntwo textual arguments. First, the court noted that clause\n(ii) is separated from clause (i) by a line break and a semi\ncolon; in contrast, the components of clause (ii)\u2014force and\ndomestic relationship\u2014are joined in an unbroken word\nflow. See 482 F. 3d, at 753.\n   Had Congress placed the \u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase in its\nown clause, set off from clause (ii) by a semicolon or a line\nbreak, the lawmakers might have better conveyed that\n\u201ccommitted by\u201d modifies only \u201coffense\u201d and not \u201cuse\u201d or\n\u201celement.\u201d Congress\u2019 less-than-meticulous drafting, how\never, hardly shows that the legislators meant to exclude\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Invoking the Dictionary Act, Hayes contends that the singular \u201cele\n\nment\u201d encompasses the plural \u201celements.\u201d See Brief for Respondent 25.\nThe Dictionary Act provides that, \u201cunless the context indicates other\nwise,\u201d \u201cwords importing the singular include and apply to several\npersons, parties, or things.\u201d 1 U.

See id., at 761\n(Williams, J., dissenting). See also United States v.

S., at 26.6\n  Applying the rule of the last antecedent here would\nrequire us to accept two unlikely premises: that Congress\nemployed the singular \u201celement\u201d to encompass two distinct\nconcepts, and that it adopted the awkward construction\n\u201ccommi[t]\u201d a \u201cuse.\u201d See supra, at 5\u20136. Moreover, as the\ndissent acknowledges, post, at 4, the last-antecedent rule\nwould render the word \u201ccommitted\u201d superfluous: Congress\ncould have conveyed the same meaning by referring sim\nply to \u201cthe use . . . of physical force . . . by a current or\nformer spouse . . . .\u201d See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29. \u201cCommitted\u201d\nretains its operative meaning only if it is read to modify\n\u201coffense.\u201d\n  Most sensibly read, then, \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) defines \u201cmis\ndemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d as a misdemeanor\noffense that (1) \u201chas, as an element, the use [of force],\u201d and\n(2) is committed by a person who has a specified domestic\nrelationship with the victim. To obtain a conviction in a\n\u00a7922(g)(9) prosecution, the Government must prove be\nyond a reasonable doubt that the victim of the predicate\noffense was the defendant\u2019s current or former spouse or\nwas related to the defendant in another specified way.\nBut that relationship, while it must be established, need\nnot be denominated an element of the predicate offense.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 As   the United States points out, the Court of Appeals \u201citself recog\nnized the flexibility of the rule [of the last antecedent].\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 20, n. 7.

Yet Congress defined \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d to include \u201cmisdemeanor[s] under\nFederal . . . law.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(i). Given the paucity of\nstate and federal statutes targeting domestic violence, we\nfind it highly improbable that Congress meant to extend\n\u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s firearm possession ban only to the relatively\nfew domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a\ndomestic relationship an element of the offense. See\nBarnes, 295 F. 3d, at 1364 (rejecting the view that \u201cCon\ngress remedied one disparity\u2014between felony and misde\nmeanor domestic violence convictions\u2014while at the same\ntime creating a new disparity among (and sometimes,\nwithin) states\u201d).9\n   The measure that became \u00a7922(g)(9) and \u00a7921(a)(33)(A),\nHayes acknowledges, initially may have had a broadly\nremedial purpose, see Brief for Respondent 28\u201329, but the\ntext of the proposal, he maintains, was revised and nar\nrowed while the measure remained in the congressional\nhopper. The compromise reflected in the text that gained\npassage, Hayes argues, restricted the legislation to of\nfenses specifically denominating a domestic relationship\nas a defining element. The changes Hayes identifies,\nhowever, do not corroborate his argument.\n   Congress did revise the language of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to\nspell out the use-of-force requirement. The proposed\nlegislation initially described the predicate domestic\nviolence offense as a \u201ccrime of violence . . . committed by\u201d a\nperson who had a domestic relationship with the victim.\n142 Cong.

There\n     fore, it will not always be possible for law enforcement\n     authorities to determine from the face of someone\u2019s\n     criminal record whether a particular misdemeanor\n     conviction involves domestic violence, as defined in\n     the new law.\u201d Id., at 26675.\nThe remarks of a single Senator are \u201cnot controlling,\u201d\nConsumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v.

S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9). The question before the Court is\nwhether the definition of \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence\u201d in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) includes misdemeanor offenses\nwith no domestic-relationship element.\n   Section 921(a)(33)(A) provides:\n    \u201c[T]he term \u2018misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u2019\n    means an offense that\u2014\n      \u201c(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or\n    Tribal law; and\n      \u201c(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of\n    physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly\n    weapon, committed by a current or former spouse,\n    parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with\n    whom the victim shares a child in common, by a per\n    son who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with\n    the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a\n    person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or\n    guardian of the victim.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)\n  The majority would read the \u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase in\nclause (ii) to modify the word \u201coffense\u201d in the opening\n2                 UNITED STATES v. HAYES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nclause of subparagraph (A), leapfrogging the word \u201cele\nment\u201d at the outset of clause (ii). That reading does not\nrequire the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to\nbe an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute.\nIndividuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes\ncontaining no reference to domestic violence would there\nfore be subject to prosecution under \u00a7922(g)(9).\n  The Court of Appeals held to the contrary that \u201ccommit\nted by\u201d modifies the immediately preceding phrase: \u201cthe\nuse or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened\nuse of a deadly weapon.\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A); 482 F. 3d 749,\n753\u2013754 (CA4 2007). Read that way, a domestic relation\nship is an element of the prior offense.\n  That seems to be the most natural reading right off the\nbat. The term at issue is \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic\nviolence.\u201d That is a defined term\u2014so the definition cer\ntainly must be parsed\u2014but it would be at least surprising\nto find from that parsing that a \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d need not by its terms have anything to\ndo with domestic violence.\n  1. The grammatical rule of the last antecedent indicates\nthat the domestic relationship is a required element of the\npredicate offense. That rule instructs that \u201ca limiting\nclause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modify\ning only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\u201d\nBarnhart v. Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). Pursuant to\nthat rule, the \u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase in clause (ii) is best\nread to modify the preceding phrase \u201cthe use or attempted\nuse of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly\nweapon.\u201d See 482 F. 3d, at 754\u2013755. By not following the\nusual grammatical rule, the majority\u2019s reading requires\njumping over two line breaks, clause (i), a semicolon, and\nthe first portion of clause (ii) to reach the more distant\nantecedent (\u201coffense\u201d). Due to the floating \u201cthat\u201d after\n\u201coffense,\u201d if \u201ccommitted by\u201d modified \u201coffense\u201d the text\nwould read \u201coffense that committed by.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   The majority counters that people do not ordinarily say\nsomeone \u201ccommit[s]\u201d a \u201cuse\u201d of force. See ante, at 6. True\nenough, but only because \u201cuse\u201d of force is a term that\nencompasses a variety of conduct, which if listed sepa\nrately would not pose the objection the majority raises\n(e.g., commits a battery, robbery, or kidnaping). There is\nno reason to believe that the reasonable drafting decision\nto insert \u201cuse\u201d of force rather than coming up with a laun\ndry list of offenses was meant to alter the meaning of the\nstatute.\n   The majority also relies on Congress\u2019s use of the word\n\u201celement\u201d in the singular. From that, the majority infers\nthat Congress intended to describe only one required\nelement\u2014the use of force. Ante, at 5. In its view, Con\ngress would have used the plural \u201celements\u201d if it meant to\nencompass both the use of force and the offender\u2019s rela\ntionship with the victim. Ibid.\n   That argument is contrary to the Dictionary Act, which\nspecifies that unless the context indicates otherwise,\n\u201cwords importing the singular include and apply to several\npersons, parties, or things.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a71; see Rowland v.\nCalifornia Men\u2019s Colony, Unit II Men\u2019s Advisory Council,\n506 U. S. 194, 200 (1993). More significantly, reading\n\u201celement\u201d as limited to the singular does not resolve what\nthat element is. See United States v. Barnes, 295 F. 3d\n1354, 1369 (CADC 2002) (Sentelle, J., dissenting). A\nsingle element often contains multiple components. In the\nvery provision at issue, the \u201cthreatened use of a deadly\nweapon\u201d includes three concepts: (1) the threatened use (2)\nof a weapon (3) that is deadly.\n   In other statutes, Congress has used the word \u201celement\u201d\nin the singular to refer to the use of force and its object.\nSee, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as\n\u201can offense that has as an element the use, attempted use,\nor threatened use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another\u201d). The majority finds it \u201cunsurprising\u201d\n4                 UNITED STATES v. HAYES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthat Congress would have chosen to combine the mode of\naggression and its object in a \u201csingle, undifferentiated\nelement.\u201d Ante, at 5, n. 4. It asserts, however, that Con\ngress would not have so joined the use of force and the\noffender\u2019s relationship with the victim, because those\nrequirements \u201care not readily conceptualized as a single\nelement.\u201d Ibid. That distinction is elusive; both 18\nU. S. C. \u00a716(a) and the provision at issue here contain as\ndistinct components the act (use of force) and the target\n(person or property in the former case, domestic relation\nship victim in the latter).\n   The majority also points out that interpreting \u201ccommit\nted by\u201d to modify the \u201cuse\u201d of force would render the word\n\u201ccommitted\u201d superfluous. That may be so, but as shown,\nreading \u201ccommitted by\u201d to modify \u201coffense\u201d has its own\nflaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an\nexample of elegant syntax under either reading. The\nmajority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the\nstatutory language reflects \u201cless-than-meticulous drafting\u201d\nand \u201csyntactical awkwardness,\u201d and \u201cis not a model of the\ncareful drafter\u2019s art.\u201d Ante, at 6, 12, 13. I am willing to\nacknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I\nconclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text\nis at least ambiguous.\n   2. That brings us to the structure of the statute. The\nmost natural reading of the statute, as it is laid out, is\nthat the underlying misdemeanor must have as an ele\nment the use of force committed by a person in a domestic\nrelationship with the victim. The definition of \u201cmisde\nmeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d is twice qualified: first,\nby the relative clause \u201cis a misdemeanor under Federal,\nState, or Tribal law\u201d; and second by the relative clause\n\u201chas, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical\nforce, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed\nby [a person in a specified domestic relationship with the\nvictim].\u201d \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (footnote omitted). The fact that\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCongress included the domestic relationship language in\nthe clause of the statute designating the element of the\npredicate offense strongly suggests that it is in fact part of\nthe required element.\n   The majority\u2019s contrary reading requires restructuring\nthe statute and adding words. The majority first must\nplace the \u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase in its own clause\u2014set off\nby a line break, a semicolon, or \u201c(iii)\u201d\u2014to indicate that\n\u201ccommitted by\u201d refers all the way back to \u201coffense.\u201d And,\nas noted, because the word \u201cthat\u201d appears at the end of\nsubparagraph (A), the statute would then read \u201can offense\nthat committed by.\u201d To arrive at its reading, the majority\nmust ignore the floating \u201cthat\u201d or add \u201cand is\u201d before\n\u201ccommitted by.\u201d\n   The Government would define \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d as \u201can offense, committed by a person\nwith a domestic relationship with the victim, that is a\nmisdemeanor and has, as an element, the use or at\ntempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a\ndeadly weapon.\u201d Brief for United States 13; see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 8\u20139. That reading also requires rearranging the\nstatute. The \u201ccommitted by\u201d phrase would have to be\nsevered from clause (ii) and moved up to appear after the\nword \u201coffense\u201d in subparagraph (A). Changing and rear\nranging the wording as the Government does to explain\nwhat the actual words mean is, in any event, not a compel\nling line of argument.\n   The majority attempts to diminish the magnitude of\nthese alterations by stating that the lawmakers might\nhave better conveyed their intent by setting off the \u201ccom\nmitted by\u201d phrase with \u201ca semicolon\u201d or \u201ca line break.\u201d\nAnte, at 6. But those are not insignificant revisions; they\nalter the structure of the statute, and we have recognized\nthat structure is often critical in resolving verbal ambigu\nity. See Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, 124\n(2000) (\u201cThe statute\u2019s structure clarifies any ambiguity\n6                 UNITED STATES v. HAYES\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ninherent in its literal language\u201d). I therefore respectfully\ndisagree with the majority that \u201cmisdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence\u201d is most sensibly read as including\nmisdemeanor offenses without a domestic-relationship\nelement.\n   3. Moving beyond text and structure, the majority rec\nognizes that there is \u201clittle . . . drafting history,\u201d ante, at\n13, but gamely trots out what there is: a statement on the\nfloor of the Senate by the bill\u2019s sponsor, see ante, at 12.\nSuch tidbits do not amount to much. See Consumer Prod\nuct Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102,\n118 (1980). This is especially true here where the state\nment was delivered the day the legislation was passed and\nafter the House of Representatives had passed the perti\nnent provision. See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah\nServices, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005); see also Brief for\nRespondent 33. The majority nonetheless looks to the\nfloor statement because \u201cthe legislative record is otherwise\n\u2018absolutely silent.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12. But that is no reason to\naccord the statement significance: We dismiss the value of\nsuch statements due to their inherent flaws as guides to\nlegislative intent, flaws that persist (and indeed may be\namplified) in the absence of other indicia of intent.\n   The majority also finds it \u201chighly improbable that Con\ngress meant to extend \u00a7922(g)(9)\u2019s firearm possession ban\nonly to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted\nunder laws rendering a domestic relationship an element\nof the offense.\u201d Ante, at 11. In its view, construing\n\u00a7922(g)(9) to exclude persons convicted under a generic\nuse-of-force statute would \u201cfrustrate Congress\u2019 manifest\npurpose,\u201d ante, at 10, of keeping guns out of the hands of\ndomestic abusers. See ante, at 10 (quoting statement of\nSen. Lautenberg, 142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996)).\n   Invoking the sponsor\u2019s objective as Congress\u2019s manifest\npurpose, however, \u201cignores the complexity of the problems\nCongress is called upon to address and the dynamics of\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Legisla\ntive enactments are the result of negotiations between\ncompeting interests; \u201cthe final language of the legislation\nmay reflect hard-fought compromises.\u201d Id., at 374. Even\nif there were sufficient sentiment to extend the gun ban,\nindividual legislators might have disagreed on the appro\npriate reach of the new provision. See ibid. Some mem\nbers might well have been willing to extend the ban be\nyond individuals convicted of felonies, but only if the\npredicate misdemeanor by its terms was addressed to\ndomestic violence.\n   4. The majority\u2019s approach will entail significant prob\nlems in application. Under the interpretation adopted by\nthe court below, it is easy to determine whether an indi\nvidual is covered by the gun ban: Simply look to the record\nof the prior conviction. Under the majority\u2019s approach, on\nthe other hand, it will often be necessary to go beyond the\nfact of conviction and \u201cengage in an elaborate factfinding\nprocess regarding the defendant\u2019s prior offens[e],\u201d Taylor\nv. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 601 (1990), to determine\nwhether it happened to involve domestic violence.\n   That is one reason we adopted a categorical approach to\npredicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1), \u201clooking only to the statutory defini\ntions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts\nunderlying those convictions.\u201d Taylor, supra, at 600; see\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 19 (2005) (Court\nconsidered \u201cpredicate offens[e] in terms not of prior con\nduct but of prior \u2018convictions\u2019 and the \u2018element[s]\u2019 of\ncrimes\u201d). As we warned in Taylor and reaffirmed in\nShepard, \u201cthe practical difficulties and potential unfair\nness of a factual approach are daunting.\u201d Taylor, supra, at\n601; see Shepard, supra, at 20. Those same concerns are\nimplicated here, given that the majority would require\njuries and courts to look at the particular facts of a prior\n8                 UNITED STATES v. HAYES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nconviction to determine whether it happened to involve\ndomestic violence, rather than simply looking to the ele\nments of the predicate offense. See ante, at 4-5.\n   5. Taking a fair view, the text of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) is am\nbiguous, the structure leans in the defendant\u2019s favor, the\npurpose leans in the Government\u2019s favor, and the legisla\ntive history does not amount to much. This is a textbook\ncase for application of the rule of lenity.\n   \u201cBecause construction of a criminal statute must be\nguided by the need for fair warning, it is rare that legisla\ntive history or statutory policies will support a construc\ntion of a statute broader than that clearly warranted by\nthe text.\u201d Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 160\n(1990). It cannot fairly be said here that the text \u201cclearly\nwarrants\u201d the counterintuitive conclusion that a \u201ccrime of\ndomestic violence\u201d need not have domestic violence as an\nelement. That leaves the majority\u2019s arguments about\nlegislative history and statutory purpose.

S. C. \u00a7921 <i>et seq.,</i> has long prohibited possession of a firearm by any person convicted of a felony. In 1996, Congress extended the prohibition to include persons convicted of \"a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" \u00a7922(g)(9). The definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" contained in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), is at issue in this case. Does that term cover a misdemeanor battery whenever the battered victim was in fact the offender's spouse (or other relation specified in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A))? Or, to trigger the possession ban, must the predicate misdemeanor identify as an element of the crime a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim? We hold that the domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a \u00a7922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense.</p> <p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>In 2004, law enforcement officers in Marion County, West Virginia, came to the home of Randy Edward Hayes in response to a 911 call reporting domestic violence. Hayes consented to a search of his home, and the officers discovered a rifle. Further investigation revealed that Hayes had recently possessed several other firearms as well. Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury returned an indictment in 2005, charging Hayes, under \u00a7\u00a7922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2), with three counts of possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>The indictment identified Hayes's predicate misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as a 1994 conviction for battery in violation of West Virginia law.<sup>[1]</sup> The victim of that battery, the indictment alleged, was Hayes's then-wife \u0097a person who \"shared a child in common\" with Hayes and \"who was cohabitating with . . . him as a spouse.\" App. 3.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Asserting that his 1994 West Virginia battery conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under \u00a7922(g)(9), Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment. Section 922(g)(9), Hayes maintained, applies only to persons previously convicted of an offense that has as an element a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim. The West Virginia statute under which he was convicted in 1994, Hayes observed, was a generic battery proscription, not a law designating a domestic relationship between offender and victim as an element of the offense. The United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia rejected Hayes's argument and denied his motion to dismiss the indictment. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384195\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384195/united-states-v-hayes/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 541-542 (2005). Hayes then entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed.</p>\n<p>In a 2-to-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed. A \u00a7922(g)(9) predicate offense, the Court of Appeals held, must \"have as an element a domestic relationship between the offender and the victim.\" 482 F. 3d 749, 751 (2007). In so ruling, the Fourth Circuit created a split between itself and the nine other Courts of Appeals that had previously published opinions deciding the same question.<sup>[3]</sup> According to those courts, \u00a7922(g)(9) does not require that the offense predicate to the defendant's firearm possession conviction have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and victim. We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), to resolve this conflict.</p> <p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Section 922(g)(9) makes it \"unlawful for any person . . . who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence . . . [to] possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\" Section 921(a)(33)(A) defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he term `misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' means an offense that\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim\" (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>This definition, all agree, imposes two requirements: First, a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" must have, \"as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" Second, it must be \"committed by\" a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim. The question here is whether the language of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) calls for a further limitation: Must the statute describing the predicate offense include, as a discrete element, the existence of a domestic relationship between offender and victim? In line with the large majority of the Courts of Appeals, we conclude that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) does not require a predicate-offense statute of that specificity. Instead, in a \u00a7922(g)(9) prosecution, it suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for \"an offense. . . committed by\" the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim.</p>\n<p>We note as an initial matter that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) uses the word \"element\" in the singular, which suggests that Congress intended to describe only one required element. Immediately following the word \"element,\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the use of force (undoubtedly a required element) and thereafter to the relationship between aggressor and victim, <i>e.g.,</i> a current or former spouse. The manner in which the offender acts, and the offender's relationship with the victim, are \"conceptually distinct attributes.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Meade,</i> 175 F. 3d 215, 218 (CA1 1999).<sup>[4]</sup> Had Congress meant to make the latter as well as the former an element of the predicate offense, it likely would have used the plural \"elements,\" as it has done in other offense-defining provisions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U. S. C. \u00a73559(c)(2)(A) (\"[T]he term `assault with intent to commit rape' means an offense that has as its elements engaging in physical contact with another person or using or brandishing a weapon against another person with intent to commit aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse.\"). Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 559 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \"element\" as \"[a] constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed \").<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Treating the relationship between aggressor and victim as an element of the predicate offense is also awkward as a matter of syntax. It requires the reader to regard \"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon\" as an expression modified by the relative clause \"committed by.\" In ordinary usage, however, we would not say that a person \"commit[s]\" a \"use.\" It is more natural to say that a person \"commit[s]\" an \"offense.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>United States</i> v. <i>Belless,</i> 338 F. 3d 1063, 1066 (CA9 2003) (\"One can `commit' a crime or an offense, but one does not `commit' `force' or `use.'\").</p>\n<p>In reaching the conclusion that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) renders both the use of force and a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim necessary elements of a qualifying predicate offense, the Fourth Circuit majority relied on two textual arguments. First, the court noted that clause (ii) is separated from clause (i) by a line break and a semicolon; in contrast, the components of clause (ii)\u0097force and domestic relationship\u0097are joined in an unbroken word flow. See 482 F. 3d, at 753.</p>\n<p>Had Congress placed the \"committed by\" phrase in its own clause, set off from clause (ii) by a semicolon or a line break, the lawmakers might have better conveyed that \"committed by\" modifies only \"offense\" and not \"use\" or \"element.\" Congress' less-than-meticulous drafting, however, hardly shows that the legislators meant to exclude from \u00a7922(g)(9)'s firearm possession prohibition domestic abusers convicted under generic assault or battery provisions.</p>\n<p>As structured, \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" by addressing in clause (i) the meaning of \"misdemeanor\" and, in turn, in clause (ii), \"crime of domestic violence.\" Because a \"crime of domestic violence\" involves both a use of force and a domestic relationship, joining these features together in clause (ii) would make sense even if Congress had no design to confine laws qualifying under \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to those designating as elements both use of force and domestic relationship between aggressor and victim. See <i>id.,</i> at 761 (Williams, J., dissenting). See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d 1354, 1358-1360, 1361 (CADC 2002) (\"The fact that the Congress somewhat awkwardly included the `committed by' phrase in subpart (ii) (instead of adding a subpart (iii)) is not significant in view of the <i>un</i>natural reading that would result if `committed by' were construed to modify `use of force.'\").</p>\n<p>A related statutory provision, 25 U. S. C. \u00a72803(3)(C), indicates that Congress did not ascribe substantive significance to the placement of line breaks and semicolons in 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A). In 2006, Congress amended \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(i) to include misdemeanors under \"[t]ribal law\" as predicate offenses. As a companion measure, Congress simultaneously enacted \u00a72803(3)(C), which employs use-of-force and domestic-relationship language virtually identical to the language earlier placed in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(i), except that \u00a72803(3)(C) uses no semicolon or line break.</p>\n<p>Section 2803(3)(C) authorizes federal agents to \"make an arrest without a warrant for an offense committed in Indian country if\u0097\"</p>\n<blockquote>\"the offense is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. . . and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent or guardian of the victim. . . .\"</blockquote>\n<p>At the time Congress enacted \u00a72803(3)(C), the Courts of Appeals uniformly agreed that \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) did not limit predicate offenses to statutory texts specifying both a use of force and a domestic relationship as offense elements. Congress presumably knew how \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) had been construed, and presumably intended \u00a72803(3)(C) to bear the same meaning. See <i>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.</i> v. <i>Dabit,</i> 547 U. S. 71, 85-86 (2006) (\"[W]hen `judicial interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial interpretations as well.'\" (quoting <i>Bragdon</i> v. <i>Abbott,</i> 524 U. S. 624, 645 (1998))). Relying on spacing and punctuation to hem in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), while reading \u00a72803(3)(C) to contain no similar limitation, would create a disjunction between these two provisions that Congress could not have intended.</p>\n<p>As a second justification for its construction of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), the Court of Appeals invoked the \"rule of the last antecedent,\" under which \"a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\" <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). The words \"committed by\" immediately follow the use-of-force language, the court observed, and therefore should be read to modify that phrase, not the earlier word \"offense.\" See 482 F. 3d, at 753-755. The rule of the last antecedent, however, \"is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\" <i>Barnhart,</i> 540 U. S., at 26.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Applying the rule of the last antecedent here would require us to accept two unlikely premises: that Congress employed the singular \"element\" to encompass two distinct concepts, and that it adopted the awkward construction \"commi[t]\" a \"use.\" See <i>supra,</i> at 5-6. Moreover, as the dissent acknowledges, <i>post,</i> at 4, the last-antecedent rule would render the word \"committed\" superfluous: Congress could have conveyed the same meaning by referring simply to \"the use . . . of physical force . . . by a current or former spouse . . . .\" See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29. \"Committed\" retains its operative meaning only if it is read to modify \"offense.\"</p>\n<p>Most sensibly read, then, \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) defines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as a misdemeanor offense that (1) \"has, as an element, the use [of force],\" and (2) is committed by a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim. To obtain a conviction in a \u00a7922(g)(9) prosecution, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim of the predicate offense was the defendant's current or former spouse or was related to the defendant in another specified way. But that relationship, while it must be established, need not be denominated an element of the predicate offense.<sup>[7]</sup></p> <p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Practical considerations strongly support our reading of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)'s language. Existing felon-in-possession laws, Congress recognized, were not keeping firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, because \"many people who engage in serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of felonies.\" 142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996) (statement of Sen. Lautenberg). By extending the federal firearm prohibition to persons convicted of \"misdemeanor crime[s] of domestic violence,\" proponents of \u00a7922(g)(9) sought to \"close this dangerous loophole.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 22986.</p>\n<p>Construing \u00a7922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute (one that does not designate a domestic relationship as an element of the offense) would frustrate Congress' manifest purpose. Firearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination nationwide. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 8-15; Brief for National Network to End Domestic Violence et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 2-8. Yet, as interpreted by the Fourth Circuit, \u00a7922(g)(9) would have been \"a dead letter\" in some two-thirds of the States from the very moment of its enactment. 482 F. 3d, at 762 (Williams, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>As of 1996, only about one-third of the States had criminal statutes that specifically proscribed <i>domestic</i> violence. See Brief for United States 23, n. 8.<sup>[8]</sup> Even in those States, domestic abusers were (and are) routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault or battery laws. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. And no statute defining a distinct federal misdemeanor designated as an element of the offense a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim. Yet Congress defined \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" to include \"misdemeanor[s] under Federal . . . law.\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(i). Given the paucity of state and federal statutes targeting <i>domestic</i> violence, we find it highly improbable that Congress meant to extend \u00a7922(g)(9)'s firearm possession ban only to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense. See <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d, at 1364 (rejecting the view that \"Congress remedied one disparity\u0097between felony and misdemeanor domestic violence convictions\u0097while at the same time creating a new disparity among (and sometimes, within) states\").<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>The measure that became \u00a7922(g)(9) and \u00a7921(a)(33)(A), Hayes acknowledges, initially may have had a broadly remedial purpose, see Brief for Respondent 28-29, but the text of the proposal, he maintains, was revised and narrowed while the measure remained in the congressional hopper. The compromise reflected in the text that gained passage, Hayes argues, restricted the legislation to offenses specifically denominating a domestic relationship as a defining element. The changes Hayes identifies, however, do not corroborate his argument.</p>\n<p>Congress did revise the language of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to spell out the use-of-force requirement. The proposed legislation initially described the predicate domestic-violence offense as a \"crime of violence . . . committed by\" a person who had a domestic relationship with the victim. 142 Cong. Rec. 5840. The final version replaced the unelaborated phrase \"crime of violence\" with the phrase \"has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" This apparently last-minute insertion may help to explain some of the syntactical awkwardness of the enacted language, but it does not evince an intention to convert the \"committed by\" phrase into a required element of the predicate offense.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in a floor statement discussing the revised version of \u00a7922(g)(9), Senator Frank Lautenberg, the sponsor of the provision, observed that a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim often would not be a designated element of the predicate offense:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[C]onvictions for domestic violence-related crimes often are for crimes, such as assault, that are not explicitly identified as related to domestic violence. Therefore, it will not always be possible for law enforcement authorities to determine from the face of someone's criminal record whether a particular misdemeanor conviction involves domestic violence, as defined in the new law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 26675.</blockquote>\n<p>The remarks of a single Senator are \"not controlling,\" <i>Consumer Product Safety Comm'n</i> v. <i>GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 447 U. S. 102, 118 (1980), but, as Hayes recognizes, the legislative record is otherwise \"absolutely silent.\" See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 35. It contains no suggestion that Congress intended to confine \u00a7922(g)(9) to abusers who had violated statutes rendering the domestic relationship between aggressor and victim an element of the offense.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>The rule of lenity, Hayes contends, provides an additional reason to construe \u00a7922(g)(9) and \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to apply only to predicate offenses that specify a domestic relationship as an element of the crime. \"[T]he touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity.\" <i>Bifulco</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). We apply the rule \"only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute.\" <i>United States</i> v. <i>Shabani,</i> 513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994). Section 921(a)(33)(A)'s definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" we acknowledge, is not a model of the careful drafter's art. See <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d, at 1356. But neither is it \"grievous[ly] ambigu[ous].\" <i>Huddleston</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 415 U. S. 814, 831 (1974). The text, context, purpose, and what little there is of drafting history all point in the same direction: Congress defined \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" to include an offense \"committed by\" a person who had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship as an element of the crime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>A person convicted of a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" is prohibited from possessing a firearm. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9). The question before the Court is whether the definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) includes misdemeanor offenses with no domestic-relationship element.</p>\n<p>Section 921(a)(33)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he term `misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' means an offense that\u0097</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.\" (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p>The majority would read the \"committed by\" phrase in clause (ii) to modify the word \"offense\" in the opening clause of subparagraph (A), leapfrogging the word \"element\" at the outset of clause (ii). That reading does not require the specified domestic relationship in clause (ii) to be an element of the predicate misdemeanor statute. Individuals convicted under generic use-of-force statutes containing no reference to domestic violence would therefore be subject to prosecution under \u00a7922(g)(9).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals held to the contrary that \"committed by\" modifies the immediately preceding phrase: \"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A); 482 F. 3d 749, 753-754 (CA4 2007). Read that way, a domestic relationship is an element of the prior offense.</p>\n<p>That seems to be the most natural reading right off the bat. The term at issue is \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\" That is a defined term\u0097so the definition certainly must be parsed\u0097but it would be at least surprising to find from that parsing that a \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" need not by its terms have anything to do with domestic violence.</p>\n<p>1. The grammatical rule of the last antecedent indicates that the domestic relationship is a required element of the predicate offense. That rule instructs that \"a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\" <i>Barnhart</i> v. <i>Thomas,</i> 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). Pursuant to that rule, the \"committed by\" phrase in clause (ii) is best read to modify the preceding phrase \"the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" See 482 F. 3d, at 754-755. By not following the usual grammatical rule, the majority's reading requires jumping over two line breaks, clause (i), a semicolon, and the first portion of clause (ii) to reach the more distant antecedent (\"offense\"). Due to the floating \"that\" after \"offense,\" if \"committed by\" modified \"offense\" the text would read \"offense that committed by.\"</p>\n<p>The majority counters that people do not ordinarily say someone \"commit[s]\" a \"use\" of force. See <i>ante,</i> at 6. True enough, but only because \"use\" of force is a term that encompasses a variety of conduct, which if listed separately would not pose the objection the majority raises (<i>e.g.,</i> commits a battery, robbery, or kidnaping). There is no reason to believe that the reasonable drafting decision to insert \"use\" of force rather than coming up with a laundry list of offenses was meant to alter the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p>The majority also relies on Congress's use of the word \"element\" in the singular. From that, the majority infers that Congress intended to describe only one required element\u0097the use of force. <i>Ante,</i> at 5. In its view, Congress would have used the plural \"elements\" if it meant to encompass both the use of force and the offender's relationship with the victim. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>That argument is contrary to the Dictionary Act, which specifies that unless the context indicates otherwise, \"words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things.\" 1 U. S. C. \u00a71; see <i>Rowland</i> v. <i>California Men's Colony, Unit II Men's Advisory Council,</i> 506 U. S. 194, 200 (1993). More significantly, reading \"element\" as limited to the singular does not resolve what that element is. See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d 1354, 1369 (CADC 2002) (Sentelle, J., dissenting). A single element often contains multiple components. In the very provision at issue, the \"threatened use of a deadly weapon\" includes three concepts: (1) the threatened use (2) of a weapon (3) that is deadly.</p>\n<p>In other statutes, Congress has used the word \"element\" in the singular to refer to the use of force and its object. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) (defining \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\"). The majority finds it \"unsurprising\" that Congress would have chosen to combine the mode of aggression and its object in a \"single, undifferentiated element.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 5, n. 4. It asserts, however, that Congress would not have so joined the use of force and the offender's relationship with the victim, because those requirements \"are not readily conceptualized as a single element.\" <i>Ibid.</i> That distinction is elusive; both 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) and the provision at issue here contain as distinct components the act (use of force) and the target (person or property in the former case, domestic relationship victim in the latter).</p>\n<p>The majority also points out that interpreting \"committed by\" to modify the \"use\" of force would render the word \"committed\" superfluous. That may be so, but as shown, reading \"committed by\" to modify \"offense\" has its own flaws. All this goes to show that the statute is not an example of elegant syntax under either reading. The majority properly acknowledges that, under its view, the statutory language reflects \"less-than-meticulous drafting\" and \"syntactical awkwardness,\" and \"is not a model of the careful drafter's art.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 6, 12, 13. I am willing to acknowledge the same with respect to my reading. But I conclude from such reciprocal shortcomings that the text is at least ambiguous.</p>\n<p>2. That brings us to the structure of the statute. The most natural reading of the statute, as it is laid out, is that the underlying misdemeanor must have as an element the use of force committed by a person in a domestic relationship with the victim. The definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" is twice qualified: first, by the relative clause \"is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law\"; and second by the relative clause \"has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by [a person in a specified domestic relationship with the victim].\" \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) (footnote omitted). The fact that Congress included the domestic relationship language in the clause of the statute designating the element of the predicate offense strongly suggests that it is in fact part of the required element.</p>\n<p>The majority's contrary reading requires restructuring the statute and adding words. The majority first must place the \"committed by\" phrase in its own clause\u0097set off by a line break, a semicolon, or \"(iii)\"\u0097to indicate that \"committed by\" refers all the way back to \"offense.\" And, as noted, because the word \"that\" appears at the end of subparagraph (A), the statute would then read \"an offense that committed by.\" To arrive at its reading, the majority must ignore the floating \"that\" or add \"and is\" before \"committed by.\"</p>\n<p>The Government would define \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" as \"an offense, committed by a person with a domestic relationship with the victim, that is a misdemeanor and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" Brief for United States 13; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9. That reading also requires rearranging the statute. The \"committed by\" phrase would have to be severed from clause (ii) and moved up to appear after the word \"offense\" in subparagraph (A). Changing and rearranging the wording as the Government does to explain what the actual words mean is, in any event, not a compelling line of argument.</p>\n<p>The majority attempts to diminish the magnitude of these alterations by stating that the lawmakers might have better conveyed their intent by setting off the \"committed by\" phrase with \"a semicolon\" or \"a line break.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 6. But those are not insignificant revisions; they alter the structure of the statute, and we have recognized that structure is often critical in resolving verbal ambiguity. See <i>Castillo</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 530 U. S. 120, 124 (2000) (\"The statute's structure clarifies any ambiguity inherent in its literal language\"). I therefore respectfully disagree with the majority that \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" is most sensibly read as including misdemeanor offenses without a domestic-relationship element.</p>\n<p>3. Moving beyond text and structure, the majority recognizes that there is \"little . . . drafting history,\" <i>ante,</i> at 13, but gamely trots out what there is: a statement on the floor of the Senate by the bill's sponsor, see <i>ante,</i> at 12. Such tidbits do not amount to much. See <i>Consumer Product Safety Comm'n</i> v. <i>GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</i> 447 U. S. 102, 118 (1980). This is especially true here where the statement was delivered the day the legislation was passed and <i>after</i> the House of Representatives had passed the pertinent provision. See <i>Exxon Mobil Corp.</i> v. <i>Allapattah Services, Inc.,</i> 545 U. S. 546, 568 (2005); see also Brief for Respondent 33. The majority nonetheless looks to the floor statement because \"the legislative record is otherwise `absolutely silent.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 12. But that is no reason to accord the statement significance: We dismiss the value of such statements due to their inherent flaws as guides to legislative intent, flaws that persist (and indeed may be amplified) in the absence of other indicia of intent.</p>\n<p>The majority also finds it \"highly improbable that Congress meant to extend \u00a7922(g)(9)'s firearm possession ban only to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 11. In its view, construing \u00a7922(g)(9) to exclude persons convicted under a generic use-of-force statute would \"frustrate Congress' manifest purpose,\" <i>ante,</i> at 10, of keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. See <i>ante,</i> at 10 (quoting statement of Sen. Lautenberg, 142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996)).</p>\n<p>Invoking the <i>sponsor's</i> objective as <i>Congress's</i> manifest purpose, however, \"ignores the complexity of the problems Congress is called upon to address and the dynamics of legislative action.\" <i>Board of Governors, FRS</i> v. <i>Dimension Financial Corp.,</i> 474 U. S. 361, 373-374 (1986). Legislative enactments are the result of negotiations between competing interests; \"the final language of the legislation may reflect hard-fought compromises.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 374. Even if there were sufficient sentiment to extend the gun ban, individual legislators might have disagreed on the appropriate reach of the new provision. See <i>ibid.</i> Some members might well have been willing to extend the ban beyond individuals convicted of felonies, but only if the predicate misdemeanor by its terms was addressed to domestic violence.</p>\n<p>4. The majority's approach will entail significant problems in application. Under the interpretation adopted by the court below, it is easy to determine whether an individual is covered by the gun ban: Simply look to the record of the prior conviction. Under the majority's approach, on the other hand, it will often be necessary to go beyond the fact of conviction and \"engage in an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant's prior offens[e],\" <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 495 U. S. 575, 601 (1990), to determine whether it happened to involve domestic violence.</p>\n<p>That is one reason we adopted a categorical approach to predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1), \"looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 600; see <i>Shepard</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 544 U. S. 13, 19 (2005) (Court considered \"predicate offens[e] in terms not of prior conduct but of prior `convictions' and the `element[s]' of crimes\"). As we warned in <i>Taylor</i> and reaffirmed in <i>Shepard,</i> \"the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach are daunting.\" <i>Taylor, supra,</i> at 601; see <i>Shepard, supra,</i> at 20. Those same concerns are implicated here, given that the majority would require juries and courts to look at the particular facts of a prior conviction to determine whether it happened to involve domestic violence, rather than simply looking to the elements of the predicate offense. See <i>ante,</i> at 4-5.</p>\n<p>5. Taking a fair view, the text of \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) is ambiguous, the structure leans in the defendant's favor, the purpose leans in the Government's favor, and the legislative history does not amount to much. This is a textbook case for application of the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p>\"Because construction of a criminal statute must be guided by the need for fair warning, it is rare that legislative history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statute broader than that clearly warranted by the text.\" <i>Crandon</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 494 U. S. 152, 160 (1990). It cannot fairly be said here that the text \"clearly warrants\" the counterintuitive conclusion that a \"crime of domestic violence\" need not have domestic violence as an element. That leaves the majority's arguments about legislative history and statutory purpose. This is not the \"rare\" case in which such grounds provide \"fair warning,\" especially given that there is nothing wrong with the conduct punished\u0097possessing a firearm\u0097if the prior misdemeanor is not covered by the statute.</p>\n<p>If the rule of lenity means anything, it is that an individual should not go to jail for failing to conduct a 50-state survey or comb through obscure legislative history. Ten years in jail is too much to hinge on the will-o'-the-wisp of statutory meaning pursued by the majority.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]   JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p>[1]  West Virginia's battery statute provides: \"[A]ny person [who] unlawfully and intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another or unlawfully and intentionally causes physical harm to another person, . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\" W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a761-2-9(c) (Lexis 2005).</p>\n<p>[2]  The indictment stated, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>\"Defendant RANDY EDWARD HAYES' February 24, 1994 Battery conviction . . . constituted a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because:</p>\n<p>\"a. Battery is a misdemeanor under State law in West Virginia;</p>\n<p>\"b. Battery has, as an element, the use and attempted use of physical force;</p>\n<p>\"c. Defendant RANDY EDWARD HAYES committed the offense of Battery against the victim:</p>\n<p>\"i. who was his current spouse; and</p>\n<p>\"ii. who was a person with whom he shared a child in common; and</p>\n<p>\"iii. who was cohabitating with and had cohabitated with him as a spouse.\" App. 2-3 (bold typeface deleted).</p>\n<p>[3]  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Heckenliable,</i> 446 F. 3d 1048, 1049 (CA10 2006); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Belless,</i> 338 F. 3d 1063, 1067 (CA9 2003); <i>White</i> v. <i>Department of Justice,</i> 328 F. 3d 1361, 1364-1367 (CA Fed. 2003); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Shelton,</i> 325 F. 3d 553, 562 (CA5 2003); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kavoukian,</i> 315 F. 3d 139, 142-144 (CA2 2002); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Barnes,</i> 295 F. 3d 1354, 1358-1361 (CADC 2002); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Chavez,</i> 204 F. 3d 1305, 1313-1314 (CA11 2000); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Meade,</i> 175 F. 3d 215, 218-221 (CA1 1999); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Smith,</i> 171 F. 3d 617, 619-621 (CA8 1999).</p>\n<p>[4]  Hayes observes, see Brief for Respondent 24-25, that Congress has used the singular \"element\" in defining a \"crime of violence\" to require both an action (the use of force) and its object (the person of another). See, <i>e.g.,</i> 18 U. S. C. \u00a716(a) (defining \"crime of violence\" as \"an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\"). Although one might conceive of an action and its object as separate elements, it is unsurprising that Congress would have chosen to denominate \"the use of force against another\" as a single, undifferentiated element. In contrast, the two requirements set out in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\u0097the use of force and the existence of a specified relationship between aggressor and victim\u0097are not readily conceptualized as a single element.</p>\n<p>[5]  Invoking the Dictionary Act, Hayes contends that the singular \"element\" encompasses the plural \"elements.\" See Brief for Respondent 25. The Dictionary Act provides that, \"unless the context indicates otherwise,\" \"words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things.\" 1 U. S. C. \u00a71. On the rare occasions when we have relied on this rule, doing so was \"necessary to carry out the evident intent of the statute.\" <i>First Nat. Bank in St. Louis</i> v. <i>Missouri,</i> 263 U. S. 640, 657 (1924). As we explain <i>infra,</i> at 10-12, Hayes's reading of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) does not accord with Congress' aim in extending the gun possession ban.</p>\n<p>[6]  As the United States points out, the Court of Appeals \"itself recognized the flexibility of the rule [of the last antecedent].\" Brief for United States 20, n. 7. Under a strict application of the rule, the \"committed by\" phrase would modify only its immediate antecedent, <i>i.e.,</i> \"the threatened use of a deadly weapon,\" and not the entire phrase \"use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.\" The court rightly regarded such a reading as implausible. See 482 F. 3d 749, 755 (CA4 2007).</p>\n<p>[7]  We find it not at all \"surprising\"\u0097indeed, it seems to us \"most natural\" \u0097to read \u00a7921(a)(33)(A) to convey that a person convicted of battering a spouse or other domestic victim has committed a \"crime of domestic violence,\" whether or not the statute of conviction happens to contain a domestic-relationship element. Cf. <i>post,</i> at 2.</p>\n<p>[8]  Additional States have enacted such statutes since 1996, but about one-half of the States still prosecute domestic violence exclusively under generally applicable criminal laws. See Brief for United States 23-24, and n. 9.</p>\n<p>[9]  Generally, as in this case, it would entail no \"`elaborate factfinding process,'\" cf. <i>post,</i> at 7, to determine whether the victim of a violent assault was the perpetrator's \"current or former spouse\" or bore one of the other domestic relationships specified in \u00a7921(a)(33)(A)(ii) to the perpetrator.</p>\n\n</div>",
