Argued November 3, 2008\u2014Decided February 24, 2009\nThe Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), enacted in 1934, authorizes the\n  Secretary of Interior, a respondent here, to acquire land and hold it\n  in trust \u201cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians,\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7465, and defines \u201cIndian\u201d to \u201cinclude all persons of Indian descent\n  who are members of any recognized tribe now under Federal jurisdic\n  tion,\u201d \u00a7479. The Narragansett Tribe was placed under the Colony of\n  Rhode Island\u2019s formal guardianship in 1709. It agreed to relinquish\n  its tribal authority and sell all but two acres of its remaining reserva\n  tion land in 1880, but then began trying to regain its land and tribal\n  status. From 1927 to 1937, federal authorities declined to give it as\n  sistance because they considered the Tribe to be under state, not fed\n  eral jurisdiction. In a 1978 agreement settling a dispute between the\n  Tribe and Rhode Island, the Tribe received title to 1,800 acres of land\n  in petitioner Charlestown in exchange for relinquishing claims to\n  state land based on aboriginal title; and it agreed that the land would\n  be subject to state law. The Tribe gained formal recognition from the\n  Federal Government in 1983, and the Secretary of Interior accepted a\n  deed of trust to the 1,800 acres in 1988. Subsequently, a dispute\n  arose over whether the Tribe\u2019s plans to build housing on an addi\n  tional 31 acres of land it had purchased complied with local regula\n  tions. While litigation was pending, the Secretary accepted the 31\n  acre parcel into trust. The Interior Board of Indian Appeals upheld\n  that decision, and petitioners sought review. The District Court\n  granted summary judgment to the Secretary and other officials, de\n  termining that \u00a7479\u2019s plain language defines \u201cIndian\u201d to include\n  members of all tribes in existence in 1934, but does not require a\n  tribe to have been federally recognized on that date; and concluding\n2                         CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    that, since the Tribe is currently federally recognized and was in ex\n    istence in 1934, it is a tribe under \u00a7479. In affirming, the First Cir\n    cuit found \u00a7479 ambiguous as to the meaning of \u201cnow under Federal\n    jurisdiction,\u201d applied the principles of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\n    ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843, and deferred\n    to the Secretary\u2019s construction of the provision to allow the land to be\n    taken into trust.\nHeld: Because the term \u201cnow under federal jurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7479 unam\n biguously refers to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction\n when the IRA was enacted in 1934, and because the Narragansett\n Tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, the Secretary does\n not have the authority to take the 31-acre parcel into trust. Pp. 7\u201316.\n    (a) When a statute\u2019s text is plain and unambiguous, United States\n v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 4, the statute must be applied according to\n its terms, see, e.g., Dodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 359. Here,\n whether the Secretary has authority to take the parcel into trust de\n pends on whether the Narragansetts are members of a \u201crecognized\n Indian Tribe now under Federal jurisdiction,\u201d which, in turn, depends\n on whether \u201cnow\u201d refers to 1998, when the Secretary accepted the\n parcel into trust, or 1934, when Congress enacted the IRA. The ordi\n nary meaning of \u201cnow,\u201d as understood at the time of enactment, was\n at \u201cthe present time; at this moment; at the time of speaking.\u201d That\n definition is consistent with interpretations given \u201cnow\u201d by this Court\n both before and after the IRA\u2019s passage. See e.g., Franklin v. United\n States, 216 U. S. 559, 569; Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308, 310\u2013\n 311. It also aligns with the word\u2019s natural reading in the context of\n the IRA. Furthermore, the Secretary\u2019s current interpretation is at\n odds with the Executive Branch\u2019s construction of \u00a7479 at the time of\n enactment. The Secretary\u2019s additional arguments in support of his\n contention that \u201cnow\u201d is ambiguous are unpersuasive. There is also\n no need to consider the parties\u2019 competing views on whether Con\n gress had a policy justification for limiting the Secretary\u2019s trust au\n thority to tribes under federal jurisdiction in 1934, since Congress\u2019\n use of \u201cnow\u201d in \u00a7479 speaks for itself and \u201ccourts must presume that\n a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute\n what it says there.\u201d Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S.\n 249, 253\u2013254. Pp. 7\u201313.\n    (b) The Court rejects alternative arguments by the Secretary and\n his amici that rely on statutory provisions other than \u00a7479 to support\n the Secretary\u2019s decision to take the parcel into trust for the Narra\n gansetts.

KEN L. \n\n          SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE \n\n                INTERIOR, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 24, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA or Act) authorizes\nthe Secretary of the Interior, a respondent in this case, to\nacquire land and hold it in trust \u201cfor the purpose of provid\ning land for Indians.\u201d Ch. 576, \u00a75, 48 Stat. 985, 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7465. The IRA defines the term \u201cIndian\u201d to \u201cinclude all\npersons of Indian descent who are members of any recog\nnized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7479.\nThe Secretary notified petitioners\u2014the State of Rhode\nIsland, its Governor, and the town of Charlestown, Rhode\nIsland\u2014that he intended to accept in trust a parcel of land\nfor use by the Narragansett Indian Tribe in accordance\nwith his claimed authority under the statute. In proceed\nings before the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA),\nthe District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the First\nCircuit, petitioners unsuccessfully challenged the Secre\ntary\u2019s authority to take the parcel into trust.\n  In reviewing the determination of the Court of Appeals,\nwe are asked to interpret the statutory phrase \u201cnow under\n2                  CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFederal jurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7479. Petitioners contend that the\nterm \u201cnow\u201d refers to the time of the statute\u2019s enactment,\nand permits the Secretary to take land into trust for mem\nbers of recognized tribes that were \u201cunder Federal juris\ndiction\u201d in 1934. The respondents argue that the word\n\u201cnow\u201d is an ambiguous term that can reasonably be con\nstrued to authorize the Secretary to take land into trust\nfor members of tribes that are \u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d\nat the time that the land is accepted into trust.\n  We agree with petitioners and hold that, for purposes of\n\u00a7479, the phrase \u201cnow under Federal jurisdiction\u201d refers to\na tribe that was under federal jurisdiction at the time of\nthe statute\u2019s enactment. As a result, \u00a7479 limits the\nSecretary\u2019s authority to taking land into trust for the\npurpose of providing land to members of a tribe that was\nunder federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in\nJune 1934. Because the record in this case establishes\nthat the Narragansett Tribe was not under federal juris\ndiction when the IRA was enacted, the Secretary does not\nhave the authority to take the parcel at issue into trust.\nWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                             I\n   At the time of colonial settlement, the Narragansett\nIndian Tribe was the indigenous occupant of much of what\nis now the State of Rhode Island. See Final Determina\ntion of Federal Acknowledgement of Narragansett Indian\nTribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (1983) (hereinaf\nter Final Determination). Initial relations between colo\nnial settlers, the Narragansett Tribe, and the other Indian\ntribes in the region were peaceful, but relations deterio\nrated in the late 17th century. The hostilities peaked in\n1675 and 1676 during the 2-year armed conflict known as\nKing Philip\u2019s War. Hundreds of colonists and thousands\nof Indians died. See E. Schultz & M. Tougias, King\nPhilip\u2019s War 5 (1999). The Narragansett Tribe, having\n                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbeen decimated, was placed under formal guardianship by\nthe Colony of Rhode Island in 1709. 48 Fed. Reg. 6177.1\n   Not quite two centuries later, in 1880, the State of\nRhode Island convinced the Narragansett Tribe to relin\nquish its tribal authority as part of an effort to assimilate\ntribal members into the local population. See Narragan\nsett Indian Tribe v. National Indian Gaming Comm\u2019n, 158\nF. 3d 1335, 1336 (CADC 1998). The Tribe also agreed to\nsell all but two acres of its remaining reservation land for\n$5,000. Ibid. Almost immediately, the Tribe regretted its\ndecisions and embarked on a campaign to regain its land\nand tribal status. Ibid. In the early 20th century, mem\nbers of the Tribe sought economic support and other assis\ntance from the Federal Government. But, in correspon\ndence spanning a 10-year period from 1927 to 1937,\nfederal officials declined their request, noting that the\nTribe was, and always had been, under the jurisdiction\nof the New England States, rather than the Federal\nGovernment.\n   Having failed to gain recognition or assistance from the\nUnited States or from the State of Rhode Island, the Tribe\nfiled suit in the 1970\u2019s to recover its ancestral land, claim\ning that the State had misappropriated its territory in\nviolation of the Indian Non-Intercourse Act, 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7177.2 The claims were resolved in 1978 by enactment of\nthe Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 92 Stat.\n813, 25 U. S. C. \u00a71701 et seq. Under the agreement codi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Narragansett Tribe recognized today is the successor to two\n\ntribes, the Narragansett and the Niantic Tribes. The two predecessor\nTribes shared territory and cultural traditions at the time of European\nsettlement and effectively merged in the aftermath of King Philip\u2019s\nWar. See Final Determination, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177.\n   2 Title 25 U. S. C. \u00a7177 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o pur\n\nchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands, or of any title or claim\nthereto, from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any\nvalidity in law or equity, unless the same be made by treaty or conven\ntion entered into pursuant to the Constitution.\u201d\n4                      CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfied by the Settlement Act, the Tribe received title to 1,800\nacres of land in Charlestown, Rhode Island, in exchange\nfor relinquishing its past and future claims to land based\non aboriginal title. The Tribe also agreed that the 1,800\nacres of land received under the Settlement Act \u201cshall be\nsubject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of\nthe State of Rhode Island.\u201d \u00a71708(a); see also \u00a71712(a).\n   The Narragansett Tribe\u2019s ongoing efforts to gain recog\nnition from the United States Government finally suc\nceeded in 1983. 48 Fed. Reg. 6177. In granting formal\nrecognition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) determined\nthat \u201cthe Narragansett community and its predecessors\nhave existed autonomously since first contact, despite\nundergoing many modifications.\u201d Id., at 6178. The BIA\nreferred to the Tribe\u2019s \u201cdocumented history dating from\n1614\u201d and noted that \u201call of the current membership are\nbelieved to be able to trace to at least one ancestor on the\nmembership lists of the Narragansett community pre\npared after the 1880 Rhode Island \u2018detribalization\u2019 act.\u201d\nIbid. After obtaining federal recognition, the Tribe began\nurging the Secretary to accept a deed of trust to the 1,800\nacres conveyed to it under the Rhode Island Indian Claims\nSettlement Act. 25 CFR \u00a783.2 (2008) (providing that\nfederal recognition is needed before an Indian tribe may\nseek \u201cthe protection, services, and benefits of the Federal\ngovernment\u201d). The Secretary acceded to the Tribe\u2019s re\nquest in 1988. See Town of Charlestown, Rhode Island v.\nEastern Area Director, Bur. of Indian Affairs, 18 IBIA 67,\n69 (1989).3\n   In 1991, the Tribe\u2019s housing authority purchased an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Tribe, the town, and the Secretary previously litigated issues\n\nrelating to the Secretary\u2019s acceptance of these 1,800 acres, and that\nmatter is not presently before this Court. See generally Town of\nCharlestown, Rhode Island, 18 IBIA 67; Rhode Island v. Narragansett\nIndian Tribe, 19 F. 3d 685 (CA1 1994); Narragansett Indian Tribe v.\nRhode Island, 449 F. 3d 16 (CA1 2006).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Narragansett Indian Tribe\nv. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F. 3d 908, 911\u2013912 (CA1\n1996). The Tribe\u2019s primary argument for noncompliance\u2014\nthat its ownership of the parcel made it a \u201cdependent\nIndian community\u201d and thus \u201cIndian country\u201d under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71151\u2014ultimately failed. 89 F. 3d, at 913\u2013922.\nBut, while the litigation was pending, the Tribe sought an\nalternative solution to free itself from compliance with\nlocal regulations: It asked the Secretary to accept the 31\nacre parcel into trust for the Tribe pursuant to 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7465. By letter dated March 6, 1998, the Secretary noti\nfied petitioners of his acceptance of the Tribe\u2019s land into\ntrust. Petitioners appealed the Secretary\u2019s decision to the\nIBIA, which upheld the Secretary\u2019s decision. See Town of\nCharlestown, Rhode Island v. Eastern Area Director,\nBureau of Indian Affairs, 35 IBIA 93 (2000).\n   Petitioners sought review of the IBIA decision pursuant\nto the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment in favor of the\nSecretary and other Department of Interior officials. As\nrelevant here, the District Court determined that the plain\nlanguage of 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479 defines \u201cIndian\u201d to include\nmembers of all tribes in existence in 1934, but does not\nrequire a tribe to have been federally recognized on that\ndate. Carcieri v. Norton, 290 F. Supp. 2d 167, 179\u2013181 (RI\n2003). According to the District Court, because it is cur\nrently \u201cfederally-recognized\u201d and \u201cexisted at the time of\nthe enactment of the IRA,\u201d the Narragansett Tribe \u201cquali\nfies as an \u2018Indian tribe\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7479.\u201d Id.,\nat 181. As a result, \u201cthe secretary possesses authority\nunder \u00a7465 to accept lands into trust for the benefit of the\nNarragansetts.\u201d Ibid.\n6                   CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, first\nin a panel decision, Carcieri v. Norton, 423 F. 3d 45 (2005),\nand then sitting en banc, 497 F. 3d 15 (CA1 2008). Al\nthough the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u201c[o]ne\nmight have an initial instinct to read the word \u2018now\u2019 [in\n\u00a7479] . . . to mean the date of [the] enactment of the stat\nute, June 18, 1934,\u201d the court concluded that there was\n\u201cambiguity as to whether to view the term . . . as operating\nat the moment Congress enacted it or at the moment the\nSecretary invokes it.\u201d Id., at 26. The Court of Appeals\nnoted that Congress has used the word \u201cnow\u201d in other\nstatutes to refer to the time of the statute\u2019s application,\nnot its enactment. Id., at 26\u201327. The Court of Appeals\nalso found that the particular statutory context of \u00a7479 did\nnot clarify the meaning of \u201cnow.\u201d On one hand, the Court\nof Appeals noted that another provision within the IRA, 25\nU. S. C. \u00a7472, uses the term \u201cnow or hereafter,\u201d which\nsupports petitioners\u2019 argument that \u201cnow,\u201d by itself, does\nnot refer to future events. But on the other hand, \u00a7479\ncontains the particular application date of \u201cJune 1, 1934,\u201d\nsuggesting that if Congress had wanted to refer to the\ndate of enactment, it could have done so more specifically.\n497 F. 3d, at 27. The Court of Appeals further reasoned\nthat both interpretations of \u201cnow\u201d are supported by rea\nsonable policy explanations, id., at 27\u201328, and it found\nthat the legislative history failed to \u201cclearly resolve the\nissue,\u201d id., at 28.\n   Having found the statute ambiguous, the Court of Ap\npeals applied the principles set forth in Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 843 (1984), and deferred to the Secretary\u2019s construc\ntion of the provision. 497 F. 3d, at 30. The court rejected\npetitioners\u2019 arguments that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation\nwas an impermissible construction of the statute. Id., at\n30\u201334. It also held that petitioners had failed to demon\nstrate that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation was inconsistent\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 4 (1997). If it is, we\nmust apply the statute according to its terms. See, e.g.,\nDodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 359 (2005); Lamie v.\nUnited States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004); Hartford\nUnderwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530\nU. S. 1, 6 (2000); Caminetti v. United States, 242 U.

C. \u00a7465.\n\u201cIndian\u201d is defined by statute as follows:\n    \u201cThe term \u2018Indian\u2019 as used in this Act shall include all\n    persons of Indian descent who are members of any rec\n    ognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction,\n    and all persons who are descendants of such members\n    who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the pre\n    sent boundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall\n    further include all other persons of one-half or more\n    Indian blood. . . . The term \u2018tribe\u2019 wherever used in\n    this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe,\n    organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one\n    reservation. . . .\u201d \u00a7479 (emphasis added).\n  The parties are in agreement, as are we, that the Secre\n8                   CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntary\u2019s authority to take the parcel in question into trust\ndepends on whether the Narragansetts are members of a\n\u201crecognized Indian Tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\u201d\nIbid. That question, in turn, requires us to decide whether\nthe word \u201cnow under Federal jurisdiction\u201d refers to 1998,\nwhen the Secretary accepted the 31-acre parcel into trust,\nor 1934, when Congress enacted the IRA.\n   We begin with the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cnow,\u201d\nas understood when the IRA was enacted. Director, Office\nof Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collier\nies, 512 U. S. 267, 272 (1994); Moskal v. United States, 498\nU. S. 103, 108\u2013109 (1990). At that time, the primary\ndefinition of \u201cnow\u201d was \u201c[a]t the present time; at this\nmoment; at the time of speaking.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Inter\nnational Dictionary 1671 (2d ed. 1934); see also Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1262 (3d ed. 1933) (defining \u201cnow\u201d to\nmean \u201c[a]t this time, or at the present moment\u201d and noting\nthat \u201c \u2018[n]ow\u2019 as used in a statute ordinarily refers to the\ndate of its taking effect . . .\u201d (emphasis added)). This\ndefinition is consistent with interpretations given to the\nword \u201cnow\u201d by this Court, both before and after passage of\nthe IRA, with respect to its use in other statutes. See, e.g.,\nFranklin v. United States, 216 U. S. 559, 568\u2013569 (1910)\n(interpreting a federal criminal statute to have \u201cadopted\nsuch punishment as the laws of the State in which such\nplace is situated now provide for the like offense\u201d (citing\nUnited States v.

For example, in the original\nversion of 25 U. S. C. \u00a7465, which provided the same\nauthority to the Secretary to accept land into trust for \u201cthe\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

S. C. \u00a7468 (referring\nto \u201cthe geographic boundaries of any Indian reservation\nnow existing or established hereafter\u201d); \u00a7472 (referring to\n\u201cIndians who may be appointed . . . to the various posi\ntions maintained, now or hereafter, by the Indian Office\u201d).\nCongress\u2019 use of the word \u201cnow\u201d in this provision, without\nthe accompanying phrase \u201cor hereafter,\u201d thus provides\nfurther textual support for the conclusion that the term\nrefers solely to events contemporaneous with the Act\u2019s\nenactment. See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S.\n438, 452 (2002) (\u201c[W]hen Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Furthermore, the Secretary\u2019s current interpretation is\nat odds with the Executive Branch\u2019s construction of this\nprovision at the time of enactment. In correspondence\nwith those who would assist him in implementing the IRA,\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier, ex\nplained that:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The current version of \u00a7465 provides \u201c[t]hat no part of such funds\n\nshall be used to acquire additional land outside of the exterior bounda\nries of Navajo Indian Reservation . . . in the event that legislation to\ndefine the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Indian Reservation in New\nMexico, and for other purposes, or similar legislation, becomes law.\u201d\n10                      CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n       \u201cSection 19 of the Indian Reorganization Act of June\n     18, 1934 (48 Stat. L., 988), provides, in effect, that the\n     term \u2018Indian\u2019 as used therein shall include\u2014(1) all\n     persons of Indian descent who are members of any\n     recognized tribe that was under Federal jurisdiction\n     at the date of the Act . . . .\u201d Letter from John Collier,\n     Commissioner, to Superintendents (Mar. 7, 1936),\n     Lodging of Respondents (emphasis added).5\n   Thus, although we do not defer to Commissioner Col\nlier\u2019s interpretation of this unambiguous statute, see\nEstate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 476\n(1992), we agree with his conclusion that the word \u201cnow\u201d\nin \u00a7479 limits the definition of \u201cIndian,\u201d and therefore\nlimits the exercise of the Secretary\u2019s trust authority under\n\u00a7465 to those members of tribes that were under federal\njurisdiction at the time the IRA was enacted.\n   The Secretary makes two other arguments in support of\nhis contention that the term \u201cnow\u201d as used in \u00a7479 is\nambiguous. We reject them both. First, the Secretary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 In addition to serving as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Col\n\nlier was \u201ca principal author of the [IRA].\u201d United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 221, n. 21 (1983). And, as both parties note, he appears to\nhave been responsible for the insertion of the words \u201cnow under Federal\njurisdiction\u201d into what is now 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479. See Hearings on S.\n2755 et al.: A Bill to Grant Indians Living Under Federal Tutelage the\nFreedom to Organize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and\nEconomic Enterprise, before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,\n73d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 266 (1934). Also, the record contains a\n1937 letter from Commissioner Collier in which, even after the passage\nof the IRA, he stated that the Federal Government still lacked any\njurisdiction over the Narragansett Tribe. App. 23a\u201324a. Commissioner\nCollier\u2019s responsibilities related to implementing the IRA make him an\nunusually persuasive source as to the meaning of the relevant statutory\nlanguage and the Tribe\u2019s status under it. See Christensen v. Harris\nCounty, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000) (explaining that an Executive Branch\nstatutory interpretation that lacks the force of law is \u201centitled to\nrespect . . . to the extent that those interpretations have the \u2018power to\npersuade\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

S. 129, 131\u2013132 (1993). Here, the\nstatutory context makes clear that \u201cnow\u201d does not mean\n\u201cnow or hereafter\u201d or \u201cat the time of application.\u201d Had\nCongress intended to legislate such a definition, it could\nhave done so explicitly, as it did in \u00a7\u00a7468 and 472, or it\ncould have omitted the word \u201cnow\u201d altogether. Instead,\nCongress limited the statute by the word \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cwe\nare obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Con\ngress used.\u201d Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339\n(1979).\n   Second, the Secretary argues that \u00a7479 left a gap for the\nagency to fill by using the phrase \u201cshall include\u201d in its\nintroductory clause. Brief for Respondents 26\u201327. The\nSecretary, in turn, claims to have permissibly filled that\ngap by defining \u201c \u2018Tribe\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018Individual Indian\u2019 \u201d without\nreference to the date of the statute\u2019s enactment. Id., at 28\n(citing 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7151.2(b), (c)(1) (2008)). But, as explained\nabove, Congress left no gap in 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479 for the\nagency to fill. Rather, it explicitly and comprehensively\ndefined the term by including only three discrete defini\ntions: \u201c[1] members of any recognized Indian tribe now\nunder Federal jurisdiction, and [2] all persons who are\ndescendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934,\nresiding within the present boundaries of any Indian\nreservation, and . . . [3] all other persons of one-half or\nmore Indian blood.\u201d Ibid. In other statutory provisions,\nCongress chose to expand the Secretary\u2019s authority to\nparticular Indian tribes not necessarily encompassed\n12                        CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nwithin the definitions of \u201cIndian\u201d set forth in \u00a7479.6 Had it\nunderstood the word \u201cinclude\u201d in \u00a7479 to encompass tribes\nother than those satisfying one of the three \u00a7479 defini\ntions, Congress would have not needed to enact these\nadditional statutory references to specific Tribes.\n   The Secretary and his amici also go beyond the statu\ntory text to argue that Congress had no policy justification\nfor limiting the Secretary\u2019s trust authority to those tribes\nunder federal jurisdiction in 1934, because the IRA was\nintended to strengthen Indian communities as a whole,\nregardless of their status in 1934. Petitioners counter that\nthe main purpose of \u00a7465 was to reverse the loss of lands\nthat Indians sustained under the General Allotment Act,\nsee Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U. S. 645, 650,\nn. 1 (2001), so the statute was limited to tribes under\nfederal jurisdiction at that time because they were the\ntribes who lost their lands. We need not consider these\ncompeting policy views, because Congress\u2019 use of the word\n\u201cnow\u201d in \u00a7479 speaks for itself and \u201ccourts must presume\nthat a legislature says in a statute what it means and\nmeans in a statute what it says there.\u201d Connecticut Nat.\nBank v.

We reject both arguments.\n   First, the Secretary and several amici argue that the\ndefinition of \u201cIndian\u201d in \u00a7479 is rendered irrelevant by the\nbroader definition of \u201ctribe\u201d in \u00a7479 and by the fact that\nthe statute authorizes the Secretary to take title to lands\n\u201cin the name of the United States in trust for the Indian\ntribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired. \u201d\n\u00a7465 (emphasis added); Brief for Respondents 12\u201314. But\nthe definition of \u201ctribe\u201d in \u00a7479 itself refers to \u201cany Indian\ntribe\u201d (emphasis added), and therefore is limited by the\ntemporal restrictions that apply to \u00a7479\u2019s definition of\n\u201cIndian.\u201d See \u00a7479 (\u201cThe term \u2018tribe\u2019 wherever used in this\nAct shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organ\nized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reserva\ntion\u201d (emphasis added)). And, although \u00a7465 authorizes\nthe United States to take land in trust for an Indian tribe,\n\u00a7465 limits the Secretary\u2019s exercise of that authority \u201cfor\nthe purpose of providing land for Indians.\u201d There simply\nis no legitimate way to circumvent the definition of \u201cIn\ndian\u201d in delineating the Secretary\u2019s authority under \u00a7\u00a7 465\nand 479. 8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 For this reason, we disagree with the argument made by JUSTICE\nSTEVENS that the term \u201cIndians\u201d in \u00a7465 has a different meaning than\nthe definition of \u201cIndian\u201d provided in \u00a7479, and that the term\u2019s meaning\nin \u00a7465 is controlled by later-enacted regulations governing the Secre\ntary\u2019s recognition of tribes like the Narragansetts. See post, at 4\u20136, 9\u2013\n11 (dissenting opinion). When Congress has enacted a definition with\n\u201cdetailed and unyielding provisions,\u201d as it has in \u00a7479, this Court must\ngive effect to that definition even when \u201c \u2018it could be argued that the\nline should have been drawn at a different point.\u2019 \u201d INS v.

C. \u00a72202, which was enacted\nas part of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), Title\nII, 96 Stat. 2517, overcomes the limitations set forth in\n\u00a7479 and, in turn, authorizes the Secretary\u2019s action.\nSection 2202 provides:\n        \u201cThe provisions of section 465 of this title shall ap\n     ply to all tribes notwithstanding the provisions of sec\n     tion 478 of this title: Provided, That nothing in this\n     section is intended to supersede any other provision of\n     Federal law which authorizes, prohibits, or restricts\n     the acquisition of land for Indians with respect to any\n     specific tribe, reservation, or state(s).\u201d (Alteration in\n     original.)\nNCAI argues that the \u201cILCA independently grants author\nity under Section 465 for the Secretary to execute the\nchallenged trust acquisition.\u201d NCAI Brief 8. We do not\nagree.\n   The plain language of \u00a72202 does not expand the power\nset forth in \u00a7465, which requires that the Secretary take\nland into trust only \u201cfor the purpose of providing land for\nIndians.\u201d Nor does \u00a72202 alter the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d\nin \u00a7479, which is limited to members of tribes that were\nunder federal jurisdiction in 1934.9 See supra, at 7\u201312.\nRather, \u00a72202 by its terms simply ensures that tribes may\nbenefit from \u00a7465 even if they opted out of the IRA pursu\nant to \u00a7478, which allowed tribal members to reject the\napplication of the IRA to their tribe. \u00a7478 (\u201cThis Act shall\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 NCAI notes that the ILCA\u2019s definition of \u201ctribe\u201d \u201cmeans any Indian\n\ntribe, band, group, pueblo, or community for which, or for the members\nof which, the United States holds lands in trust.\u201d \u00a72201.

As a\nresult, there is no conflict between \u00a72202 and the limita\ntion on the Secretary\u2019s authority to take lands contained\nin \u00a7465. Rather, \u00a72202 provides additional protections to\nthose who satisfied the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d in \u00a7479 at the\ntime of the statute\u2019s enactment, but opted out of the IRA\nshortly thereafter.\n   NCAI\u2019s reading of \u00a72202 also would nullify the plain\nmeaning of the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d set forth in \u00a7479 and\nincorporated into \u00a7465. Consistent with our obligation to\ngive effect to every provision of the statute, Reiter, 442\nU.

Linguistically speaking, the word \u201cnow\u201d in\nthe phrase \u201cnow under Federal jurisdiction,\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7479, may refer to a tribe\u2019s jurisdictional status as of 1934.\nBut one could also read it to refer to the time the Secre\ntary of the Interior exercises his authority to take land \u201cfor\nIndians.\u201d \u00a7465. Compare Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S.\n308, 311\u2013312 (1961) (\u201cnow\u201d refers to time of statutory\nenactment), with Difford v. Secretary of HHS, 910 F. 2d\n1316, 1320 (CA6 1990) (\u201cnow\u201d refers to time of exercise of\ndelegated authority); In re Lusk\u2019s Estate, 336 Pa. 465,\n467\u2013468, 9 A. 2d 363, 365 (1939) (property \u201cnow\u201d owned\nrefers to property owned when a will becomes operative).\nI also concede that the Court owes the Interior Depart\nment the kind of interpretive respect that reflects an\nagency\u2019s greater knowledge of the circumstances in which\na statute was enacted, cf. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134 (1944). Yet because the Department then fa\nvored the Court\u2019s present interpretation, see infra, at 2,\nthat respect cannot help the Department here.\n  Neither can Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\n2                  CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), help the De\npartment. The scope of the word \u201cnow\u201d raises an interpre\ntive question of considerable importance; the provision\u2019s\nlegislative history makes clear that Congress focused\ndirectly upon that language, believing it definitively re\nsolved a specific underlying difficulty; and nothing in that\nhistory indicates that Congress believed departmental\nexpertise should subsequently play a role in fixing the\ntemporal reference of the word \u201cnow.\u201d These circum\nstances indicate that Congress did not intend to delegate\ninterpretive authority to the Department. Consequently,\nits interpretation is not entitled to Chevron deference,\ndespite linguistic ambiguity. See United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 227, 229\u2013230 (2001).\n   Second, I am persuaded that \u201cnow\u201d means \u201cin 1934\u201d not\nonly for the reasons the Court gives but also because an\nexamination of the provision\u2019s legislative history convinces\nme that Congress so intended. As I read that history, it\nshows that Congress expected the phrase would make\nclear that the Secretary could employ \u00a7465\u2019s power to take\nland into trust in favor only of those tribes in respect to\nwhich the Federal Government already had the kinds of\nobligations that the words \u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d\nimply. See Hearings on S. 2755 et al.: A Bill to Grant to\nIndians Living Under Federal Tutelage the Freedom to\nOrganize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and\nEconomic Enterprise, before the Senate Committee on\nIndian Affairs, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, pp. 263\u2013266\n(1934). Indeed, the very Department official who sug\ngested the phrase to Congress during the relevant legisla\ntive hearings subsequently explained its meaning in terms\nthat the Court now adopts. See Letter from John Collier,\nCommissioner, to Superintendents (Mar. 7, 1936), Lodging\nof Respondents (explaining that \u00a7479 included \u201cpersons of\nIndian descent who are members of any recognized tribe\nthat was under Federal jurisdiction at the date of the\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nAct\u201d).\n   Third, an interpretation that reads \u201cnow\u201d as meaning\n\u201cin 1934\u201d may prove somewhat less restrictive than it at\nfirst appears. That is because a tribe may have been\n\u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934 even though the\nFederal Government did not believe so at the time. We\nknow, for example, that following the Indian Reorganiza\ntion Act\u2019s enactment, the Department compiled a list of\n258 tribes covered by the Act; and we also know that it\nwrongly left certain tribes off the list. See Brief for Law\nProfessors Specializing in Federal Indian Law as Amicus\nCuriae 22\u201324; Quinn, Federal Acknowledgment of Ameri\ncan Indian Tribes: The Historical Development of a Legal\nConcept, 34 Am. J. Legal Hist. 331, 356\u2013359 (1990). The\nDepartment later recognized some of those tribes on\ngrounds that showed that it should have recognized them\nin 1934 even though it did not. And the Department has\nsometimes considered that circumstance sufficient to show\nthat a tribe was \u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934\u2014\neven though the Department did not know it at the time.\n    The statute, after all, imposes no time limit upon rec\nognition. See \u00a7479 (\u201cThe term \u2018Indian\u2019 . . . shall include all\npersons of Indian descent who are members of any recog\nnized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction . . .\u201d\n(emphasis added)). And administrative practice suggests\nthat the Department has accepted this possibility. The\nDepartment, for example, did not recognize the Stilla\nguamish Tribe until 1976, but its reasons for recognition\nin 1976 included the fact that the Tribe had maintained\ntreaty rights against the United States since 1855. Con\nsequently, the Department concluded that land could be\ntaken into trust for the Tribe. See Memorandum from\nAssociate Solicitor, Indian Affairs to Assistant Secretary,\nIndian Affairs, Request for Reconsideration of Decision\nNot to Take Land in Trust for the Stillaguamish Tribe\n(Oct. 1, 1980), Lodging of Respondents 6\u20137. Similarly, in\n4                   CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\n1934 the Department thought that the Grand Traverse\nBand of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians had long since\nbeen dissolved. Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa & Chip\npewa Indians v. Office of U. S. Attorney for Western Dist.\nof Mich., 369 F. 3d 960, 961, and n. 2 (CA6 2004). But\nlater the Department recognized the Tribe, considering it\nto have existed continuously since 1675. 45 Fed. Reg.\n19321 (1980). Further, the Department in the 1930\u2019s\nthought that an anthropological study showed that the\nMole Lake Tribe no longer existed. But the Department\nlater decided that the study was wrong, and it then recog\nnized the Tribe. See Memorandum from the Solicitor to\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs 2758, 2762\u20132763 (Feb.\n8, 1937) (recognizing the Mole Lake Indians as a separate\ntribe).\n    In my view, this possibility\u2014that later recognition\nreflects earlier \u201cFederal jurisdiction\u201d\u2014explains some of\nthe instances of early Department administrative practice\nto which JUSTICE STEVENS refers. I would explain the\nother instances to which JUSTICE STEVENS refers as in\nvolving the taking of land \u201cfor\u201d a tribe with members who\nfall under that portion of the statute that defines \u201cIndians\u201d\nto include \u201cpersons of one-half or more Indian blood,\u201d \u00a7479.\nSee 1 Dept. of Interior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating\nto Indian Affairs, 1917\u20131974, pp. 706\u2013707 (Shoshone\nIndians), 724\u2013725 (St. Croix Chippewas), 747\u2013748 (Nahma\nand Beaver Indians) (1979).\n     Neither the Narragansett Tribe nor the Secretary has\nargued that the Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in\n1934. Nor have they claimed that any member of the\nNarragansett Tribe satisfies the \u201cone-half or more Indian\nblood\u201d requirement. And I have found nothing in the\nbriefs that suggests the Narragansett Tribe could prevail\non either theory. Each of the administrative decisions\njust discussed involved post-1934 recognition on grounds\nthat implied a 1934 relationship between the tribe and\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I can\nfind no similar indication of 1934 federal jurisdiction here.\nInstead, both the State and Federal Government consid\nered the Narragansett Tribe as under state, but not under\nfederal, jurisdiction in 1934. And until the 1970\u2019s there\nwas \u201clittle Federal contact with the Narragansetts as a\ngroup.\u201d Memorandum from Deputy Assistant Secretary\u2014\nIndian Affairs (Operations) to Assistant Scretary\u2014Indian\nAffairs, Recommendation and Summary of Evidence for\nProposed Finding for Federal Acknowledgment of Narra\ngansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island Pursuant to 25 CFR\n83, p. 8 (July 29, 1982). Because I see no realistic possi\nbility that the Narragansett Tribe could prevail on the\nbasis of a theory alternative to the theories argued here, I\nwould not remand this case.\n    With the qualifications here expressed, I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion and its judgment.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I have, however, a further reservation\nthat puts me in the dissenting column.\n  The disposition of the case turns on the construction of\nthe language from 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479, \u201cany recognized In\ndian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\u201d Nothing in the\nmajority opinion forecloses the possibility that the two\nconcepts, recognition and jurisdiction, may be given sepa\nrate content. As JUSTICE BREYER makes clear in his\nconcurrence, the statute imposes no time limit upon rec\nognition, and in the past, the Department of the Interior\nhas stated that the fact that the United States Govern\nment was ignorant of a tribe in 1934 does not preclude\nthat tribe from having been under federal jurisdiction at\nthat time. See Memorandum from Associate Solicitor,\nIndian Affairs, to Assistant Secretary, Indian Affairs,\nRequest for Reconsideration of Decision Not to Take Land\nin Trust for the Stillaguamish Tribe (Oct. 1, 1980), Lodg\ning of Respondents 7.

SALAZAR\n\n                         Opinion of SOUTER, J.\n\nmeaning would be consistent with established principles of\nstatutory interpretation.\n   During oral argument, however, respondents explained\nthat the Secretary\u2019s more recent interpretation of this\nstatutory language had \u201cunderstood recognition and under\nFederal jurisdiction at least with respect to tribes to be\none and the same.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 42. Given the Secre\ntary\u2019s position, it is not surprising that neither he nor the\nTribe raised a claim that the Tribe was under federal\njurisdiction in 1934: they simply failed to address an issue\nthat no party understood to be present. The error was\nshared equally all around, and there is no equitable de\nmand that one side be penalized when both sides nodded.\n   I can agree with JUSTICE BREYER that the current re\ncord raises no particular reason to expect that the Tribe\nmight be shown to have been under federal jurisdiction in\n1934, but I would not stop there. The very notion of juris\ndiction as a distinct statutory condition was ignored in\nthis litigation, and I know of no body of precedent or his\ntory of practice giving content to the condition sufficient\nfor gauging the Tribe\u2019s chances of satisfying it. So I see no\nreason to deny the Secretary and the Narragansett Tribe\nan opportunity to advocate a construction of the \u201cjurisdic\ntion\u201d phrase that might favor their position here.\n   I would therefore reverse and remand with opportunity\nfor respondents to pursue a \u201cjurisdiction\u201d claim and re\nspectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s straight reversal.*\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Depending on the outcome of proceedings on remand, it might be\nnecessary to address the second potential issue in this case, going to the\nsignificance of the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 25\nU.

The Act specifies that benefits shall be\navailable to individuals who qualify as Indian either as a\nresult of blood quantum or as descendants of members of\n\u201cany recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdic\ntion.\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479. In contesting the Secretary of the\nInterior\u2019s acquisition of trust land for the Narragansett\nTribe of Rhode Island, the parties have focused on the\nmeaning of \u201cnow\u201d in the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian.\u201d Yet to\nmy mind, whether \u201cnow\u201d means 1934 (as the Court holds)\nor the present time (as respondents would have it) sheds\nno light on the question whether the Secretary\u2019s actions on\nbehalf of the Narragansett were permitted under the\nstatute. The plain text of the Act clearly authorizes the\nSecretary to take land into trust for Indian tribes as well\nas individual Indians, and it places no temporal limitation\non the definition of \u201cIndian tribe.\u201d1 Because the Narra\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In 25 U.

Although\nit was once one of the most powerful tribes in New Eng\nland, a series of wars, epidemics, and difficult relations\nwith the State of Rhode Island sharply reduced the Tribe\u2019s\nancestral landholdings.\n   Two blows, delivered centuries apart, exacted a particu\nlarly high toll on the Tribe. First, in 1675, King Philip\u2019s\nWar essentially destroyed the Tribe, forcing it to accept\nthe Crown as sovereign and to submit to the guardianship\nof the Colony of Rhode Island. Then, in 1880, the State of\nRhode Island passed a \u201cdetribalization\u201d law that abolished\ntribal authority, ended the State\u2019s guardianship of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   \u201cThe term \u2018Indian\u2019 as used in this Act shall include all persons of\nIndian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now\nunder Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such\nmembers who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present\nboundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include\nall other persons of one-half or more Indian blood. . . . The term\n\u2018tribe\u2019 wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to\nany Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one\nreservation.\u201d\n   Notably the word \u201cnow,\u201d which is used to define one of the categories\nof Indians, does not appear in the definition of \u201ctribe.\u201d\n   2 In 1991, the Narragansett Tribe purchased the 31-acre parcel in fee\n\nsimple from a private developer. In 1998, the Bureau of Indian Affairs\nnotified the State of the Secretary\u2019s decision to take the land into\nunreserved trust for the Tribe. The Tribe \u201cacquired [the land] for the\nexpress purpose of building much needed low-income Indian Housing\nvia a contract between the Narragansett Indian Wetuomuck Housing\nAuthority (NIWHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Devel\nopment (HUD).\u201d App. 46a.\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

The Narra\ngansett originally assented to detribalization and ceded all\nbut two acres of its ancestral land. In return, the Tribe\nreceived $5,000. See Memorandum from the Deputy\nAssistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Operations) to Assis\ntant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Operations) 4 (July 19,\n1982) (Recommendation for Acknowledgment).\n   Recognizing that its consent to detribalization was a\nmistake, the Tribe embarked on a century-long campaign\nto recoup its losses.3 Obtaining federal recognition was\ncritical to this effort. The Secretary officially recognized\nthe Narragansett as an Indian tribe in 1983, Final Deter\nmination for Federal Acknowledgement of Narragansett\nIndian Tribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177, and with\nthat recognition the Tribe qualified for the bundle of fed\neral benefits established in the Indian Reorganization Act\nof 1934 (IRA or Act),4 25 U. S. C. \u00a7461 et seq. The Tribe\u2019s\nattempt to exercise one of those rights, the ability to peti\ntion the Secretary to take land into trust for the Tribe\u2019s\nbenefit, is now vigorously contested in this litigation.\n                            II\n  The Secretary\u2019s trust authority is located in 25 U.

An individual Indian, \u00a7479 tells us, \u201cshall include\nall persons of Indian descent who are members of any\nrecognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction\u201d as\nwell as \u201call other persons of one-half or more Indian\nblood.\u201d A tribe, \u00a7479 goes on to state, \u201cshall be construed\nto refer to any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the\nIndians residing on one reservation.\u201d Because federal\nrecognition is generally required before a tribe can receive\nfederal benefits, the Secretary has interpreted this defini\ntion of \u201ctribe\u201d to refer only to recognized tribes. See 25\nCFR \u00a783.2 (2008) (stating that recognition \u201cis a prerequi\nsite to the protection, services, and benefits of the Federal\ngovernment available to Indian tribes by virtue of their\nstatus as tribes\u201d); \u00a7151.2 (defining \u201ctribe\u201d for the purposes\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 Section\n            465 reads more fully:\n  \u201cThe Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in his discretion, to\nacquire, through purchase, relinquishment, gift, exchange, or assign\nment, any interest in lands, water rights, or surface rights to lands,\nwithin or without existing reservations, including trust or otherwise\nrestricted allotments whether the allottee be living or deceased, for the\npurpose of providing land for Indians.\n         .            .              .              .              .\n  \u201cTitle to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this Act . . . shall be\ntaken in the name of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe or\nindividual Indian for which the land is acquired, and such lands or\nrights shall be exempt from State and local taxation.\u201d\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

The\nstatute reflects Congress\u2019 intent to extend certain benefits\nto individual Indians, e.g., 25 U. S. C. \u00a7471 (offering loans\nto Indian students for tuition at vocational and trade\nschools); \u00a7472 (granting hiring preferences to Indians\nseeking federal employment related to Indian affairs),\nwhile directing other benefits to tribes, e.g., \u00a7476 (allowing\ntribes to adopt constitutions and bylaws); \u00a7470 (giving\nloans to Indian-chartered corporations).\n   Section 465, by giving the Secretary discretion to steer\nbenefits to tribes and individuals alike, is therefore\nunique. But establishing this broad benefit scheme was\nundoubtedly intentional: The original draft of the IRA\npresented to Congress directed the Secretary to take land\ninto trust only for entities such as tribes. Compare H. R.\n7902, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 30 (1934) (\u201cTitle to any land\nacquired pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be\ntaken in the name of the United States in trust for the\nIndian tribe or community for whom the land is acquired\u201d\n(emphasis added)), with 25 U.

Thus, contrary to the argument pressed by the Governor of Rhode\nIsland before this Court, see Reply Brief for Petitioner Carcieri 9, the\nrequirement that a tribe be federally recognized before it is eligible for\ntrust land does not stem from the IRA.\n6                   CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntaken in the name of the United States in trust for the\nIndian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is\nacquired\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   The Secretary has long exercised his \u00a7465 trust author\nity in accordance with this design. In the years immedi\nately following the adoption of the IRA, the Solicitor of the\nDepartment of the Interior repeatedly advised that the\nSecretary could take land into trust for federally recog\nnized tribes and for individual Indians who qualified for\nfederal benefits by lineage or blood quantum.\n   For example, in 1937, when evaluating whether the\nSecretary could purchase approximately 2,100 acres of\nland for the Mole Lake Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin,\nthe Solicitor instructed that the purchase could not be\n\u201ccompleted until it is determined whether the beneficiary\nof the trust title should be designated as a band or\nwhether the title should be taken for the individual Indi\nans in the vicinity of Mole Lake who are of one half or\nmore Indian blood.\u201d Memorandum from the Solicitor to\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs 2758 (Feb. 8, 1937).\nBecause the Mole Lake Chippewa was not yet recognized\nby the Federal Government as an Indian tribe, the Solici\ntor determined that the Secretary had two options: \u201cEither\nthe Department should provide recognition of this group,\nor title to the purchased land should be taken on behalf of\nthe individuals who are of one half or more Indian blood.\u201d\nId., at 2763.\n   The tribal trust and individual trust options were simi\nlarly outlined in other post-1934 opinion letters, including\nthose dealing with the Shoshone Indians of Nevada, the\nSt. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, and the Nahma\nand Beaver Island Indians of Michigan. See 1 Dept. of\nInterior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating to Indian Af\nfairs, 1917\u20131974, pp. 706\u2013707, 724\u2013725, 747\u2013748 (1979).\nUnless and until a tribe was formally recognized by the\nFederal Government and therefore eligible for trust land,\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

Absent a specific statute recognizing a tribe\nand authorizing a trust land acquisition,7 the Secretary\nhas exercised his trust authority\u2014now governed by regu\nlations promulgated in 1980 after notice-and-comment\nrulemaking, 25 CFR \u00a7151 et seq.; 45 Fed. Reg. 62034\u2014to\nacquire land for federally recognized Indian tribes like the\nNarragansett. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottowa and\nChippewa Indians, although denied federal recognition in\n1934 and 1943, see Dept. of Interior, Office of Federal\nAcknowledgement, Memorandum from Acting Deputy\nCommissioner to Assistant Secretary 4 (Oct. 3, 1979)\n(GTB\u2013V001\u2013D002), was the first tribe the Secretary rec\nognized under the 1980 regulations, see 45 Fed. Reg.\n19322. Since then, the Secretary has used his trust au\nthority to expand the Tribe\u2019s land base. See, e.g., 49 Fed.\nReg. 2025\u20132026 (1984) (setting aside a 12.5-acre parcel as\nreservation land for the Tribe\u2019s exclusive use). The Tu\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Although   Congress has passed specific statutes granting the Secre\ntary authority to take land into trust for certain tribes, it would be a\nmistake to conclude that the Secretary lacks residual authority to take\nland into trust under 25 U. S. C. \u00a7465 of the IRA. Some of these stat\nutes place explicit limits on the Secretary\u2019s trust authority and can be\nproperly read as establishing the outer limit of the Secretary\u2019s trust\nauthority with respect to the specified tribes. See, e.g., \u00a71724(d) (au\nthorizing trust land for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the\nPassamaquoddy Tribe of Maine, and the Penobscot Tribe of Maine).\nOther statutes, while identifying certain parcels the Secretary will take\ninto trust for a tribe, do not purport to diminish the Secretary\u2019s residual\nauthority under \u00a7465. See, e.g., \u00a71775c(a) (Mohegan Tribe); \u00a71771d\n(Wampanoag Tribe); \u00a71747(a) (Miccosukee Tribe). Indeed, the Secre\ntary has invoked his \u00a7465 authority to take additional land into trust\nfor the Miccosukee Tribe despite the existence of a statute authorizing\nand directing him to acquire certain land for the Tribe. See Post-\nArgument En Banc Brief for National Congress of American Indians\net al. as Amici Curiae 7 and App. 9 in No. 03\u20132647 (CA1).\n8                   CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nnica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana has similarly benefited from\nadministrative recognition, 46 Fed. Reg. 38411 (1981),\nfollowed by tribal trust acquisition. And in 2006, the\nSecretary took land into trust for the Snoqualmie Tribe\nwhich, although unrecognized as an Indian tribe in the\n1950\u2019s, regained federal recognition in 1999. See 71 Fed.\nReg. 5067 (taking land into trust for the Tribe); 62 Fed.\nReg. 45864 (1997) (recognizing the Snoqualmie as an\nIndian tribe).\n   This brief history of \u00a7465 places the case before us into\nproper context. Federal recognition, regardless of when it\nis conferred, is the necessary condition that triggers a\ntribe\u2019s eligibility to receive trust land. No party has dis\nputed that the Narragansett Tribe was properly recog\nnized as an Indian tribe in 1983. See 48 Fed. Reg. 6177.\nIndeed, given that the Tribe has a documented history\nthat stretches back to 1614 and has met the rigorous\ncriteria for administrative recognition, Recommendation\nfor Acknowledgment 1, 7\u201318, it would be difficult to sus\ntain an objection to the Tribe\u2019s status. With this in mind,\nand in light of the Secretary\u2019s longstanding authority\nunder the plain text of the IRA to acquire tribal trust land,\nit is perfectly clear that the Secretary\u2019s land acquisition\nfor the Narragansett was entirely proper.\n                              III\n   Despite the clear text of the IRA and historical pedigree\nof the Secretary\u2019s actions on behalf of the Narragansett,\nthe majority holds that one word (\u201cnow\u201d) nestled in one\nclause in one of \u00a7479\u2019s several definitions demonstrates\nthat the Secretary acted outside his statutory authority in\nthis case. The consequences of the majority\u2019s reading are\nboth curious and harsh: curious because it turns \u201cnow\u201d\ninto the most important word in the IRA, limiting not only\nsome individuals\u2019 eligibility for federal benefits but also a\ntribe\u2019s; harsh because it would result in the unsupportable\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           9\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nconclusion that, despite its 1983 administrative recogni\ntion, the Narragansett Tribe is not an Indian tribe under\nthe IRA.\n   In the Court\u2019s telling, when Congress granted the Secre\ntary power to acquire trust land \u201cfor the purpose of provid\ning land for Indians,\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a7465 (emphasis added), it\nmeant to permit land acquisitions for those persons whose\ntribal membership qualify them as \u201cIndian\u201d as defined by\n\u00a7479. In other words, the argument runs, the Secretary\ncan acquire trust land for \u201cpersons of Indian descent who\nare members of any recognized Indian tribe now under\nFederal jurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7479. This strained construction,\nadvanced by petitioners, explains the majority\u2019s laser-like\nfocus on the meaning of \u201cnow\u201d: If the Narragansett Tribe\nwas not recognized or under federal jurisdiction in 1934,\nthe Tribe\u2019s members do not belong to an Indian tribe \u201cnow\nunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d and would therefore not be\n\u201cIndians\u201d under \u00a7465 by virtue of their tribal membership.\n   Petitioners\u2019 argument works only if one reads \u201cIndians\u201d\n(in the phrase in \u00a7465 \u201cproviding land for Indians\u201d) to\nrefer to individuals, not an Indian tribe. To petitioners,\nthis reading is obvious; the alternative, they insist, would\nbe \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner State of Rhode\nIsland 3. This they argue despite the clear evidence of\nCongress\u2019 intent to provide the Secretary with the option\nof acquiring either tribal trusts or individual trusts in\nservice of \u201cproviding land for Indians.\u201d And they ignore\nunambiguous evidence that Congress used \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\nand \u201cIndians\u201d interchangeably in other parts of the IRA.\nSee \u00a7475 (discussing \u201cany claim or suit of any Indian tribe\nagainst the United States\u201d in the first sentence and \u201cany\nclaim of such Indians against the United States\u201d in the\nlast sentence (emphasis added)).\n   In any event, this much must be admitted: Without the\nbenefit of context, a reasonable person could conclude that\n\u201cIndians\u201d refers to multiple individuals who each qualify\n10                     CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas \u201cIndian\u201d under the IRA. An equally reasonable person\ncould also conclude that \u201cIndians\u201d is meant to refer to a\ncollective, namely, an Indian tribe. Because \u201c[t]he mean\ning\u2014or ambiguity\u2014of certain words or phrases may only\nbecome evident when placed in context,\u201d FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132 (2000), the\nproper course of action is to widen the interpretive lens\nand look to the rest of the statute for clarity. Doing so\nwould lead to \u00a7465\u2019s last sentence, which specifies that the\nSecretary is to hold land in trust \u201cfor the Indian tribe or\nindividual Indian for which the land is acquired.\u201d Put\nsimply, in \u00a7465 Congress used the term \u201cIndians\u201d to refer\nboth to tribes and individuals.8\n   The majority nevertheless dismisses this reading of the\nstatute. The Court notes that even if the Secretary has\nauthority to take land into trust for a tribe, it must be an\n\u201cIndian tribe,\u201d with \u00a7479\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian\u201d determin\ning a tribe\u2019s eligibility. The statute\u2019s definition of \u201ctribe,\u201d\nthe majority goes on to state, itself makes reference to\n\u201cIndian tribe.\u201d Thus, the Court concludes, \u201c[t]here simply\nis no legitimate way to circumvent the definition of \u2018In\ndian\u2019 in delineating the Secretary\u2019s authority under \u00a7479.\u201d\nAnte, at 13.\n   The majority bypasses a straightforward explanation on\nits way to a circular one. Requiring that a tribe be an\n\u201cIndian tribe\u201d does not demand immediate reference to the\ndefinition of \u201cIndian\u201d; instead, it simply reflects the re\nquirement that the tribe in question be formally recog\nnized as an Indian tribe. As explained above, the Secre\ntary has limited benefits under federal Indian law\u2014\nincluding the acquisition of trust land\u2014to recognized\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority continues to insist, quite incorrectly, that Congress\nmeant the term \u201cIndians\u201d in \u00a7465 to have the same meaning as the\nterm \u201cIndian\u201d in \u00a7479. That the text of the statute tells a different\nstory appears to be an inconvenience the Court would rather ignore.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntribes. Recognition, then, is the central requirement for\nbeing considered an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d for purposes of the Act.\nIf a tribe satisfies the stringent criteria established by the\nSecretary to qualify for federal recognition, including the\nrequirement that the tribe prove that it \u201chas existed as a\ncommunity from historical times until the present,\u201d 25\nCFR \u00a783.7(b) (2008), it is a fortiori an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d as a\nmatter of law.\n   The Narragansett Tribe is no different. In 1983, upon\nmeeting the criteria for recognition, the Secretary gave\nnotice that \u201cthe Narragansett Indian Tribe . . . exists as an\nIndian tribe.\u201d 48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (emphasis added). How\nthe Narragansett could be an Indian tribe in 1983 and yet\nnot be an Indian tribe today is a proposition the majority\ncannot explain.\n   The majority\u2019s retort, that because \u201ctribe\u201d refers to\n\u201cIndian,\u201d the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d must control which\ngroups can be considered a \u201ctribe,\u201d is entirely circular.\nYes, the word \u201ctribe\u201d is defined in part by reference to\n\u201cIndian tribe.\u201d But the word \u201cIndian\u201d is also defined in\npart by reference to \u201cIndian tribe.\u201d Relying on one defini\ntion to provide content to the other is thus \u201ccompletely\ncircular and explains nothing.\u201d Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.\nv. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 323 (1992).\n   The Governor of Rhode Island, for his part, adopts this\ncircular logic and offers two examples of why reading the\nstatute any other way would be implausible. He first\nargues that if \u00a7479\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian\u201d does not deter\nmine a tribe\u2019s eligibility, the Secretary would have author\nity to take land into trust \u201cfor the benefit of any group that\nhe deems, at his whim and fancy, to be an \u2018Indian tribe.\u2019 \u201d\nReply Brief for Petitioner Carcieri 7. The Governor carica\ntures the Secretary\u2019s discretion. This Court has long made\nclear that Congress\u2014and therefore the Secretary\u2014lacks\nconstitutional authority to \u201cbring a community or body of\npeople within [federal jurisdiction] by arbitrarily calling\n12                      CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthem an Indian tribe.\u201d United States v. Sandoval, 231\nU. S. 28, 46 (1913). The Governor\u2019s next objection, that\ncondoning the acquisition of trust land for the Narragan\nsett Tribe would allow the Secretary to acquire land for an\nIndian tribe that lacks Indians, is equally unpersuasive.\nAs a general matter, to obtain federal recognition, a tribe\nmust demonstrate that its \u201cmembership consists of indi\nviduals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from\nhistorical Indian tribes which combined and functioned as\na single autonomous political entity.\u201d 25 CFR \u00a783.7(e)\n(2008). If the Governor suspects that the Narragansett is\nnot an Indian tribe because it may lack members who are\nblood quantum Indians, he should have challenged the\nSecretary\u2019s decision to recognize the Tribe in 1983 when\nsuch an objection could have been properly received.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The  Department of the Interior found \u201ca high degree of retention of\n[Narragansett] family lines\u201d between 1880 and 1980, and remarked\nthat \u201c[t]he close intermarriage and stability of composition, plus the\ngeographic stability of the group, reflect the maintenance of a socially\ndistinct community.\u201d Recommendation for Acknowledgment 10. It also\nnoted that the Narragansett \u201crequire applicants for full voting mem\nbership to trace their Narragansett Indian bloodlines back to the\n\u2018Detribalization Rolls of 1880\u201384.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 16. The record in this case\ndoes not tell us how many members of the Narragansett currently\nqualify as \u201cIndian\u201d by meeting the individual blood quantum require\nment. Indeed, it is possible that a significant number of the Narragan\nsett are blood quantum Indians. Accordingly, nothing the Court\ndecides today prevents the Secretary from taking land into trust for\nthose members of the Tribe who independently qualify as \u201cIndian\u201d\nunder 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479.\n  Although the record does not demonstrate how many members of the\nNarragansett qualify as blood quantum Indians, JUSTICE BREYER\nnevertheless assumes that no member of the Tribe is a blood quantum\nIndian. Ante, at 4 (concurring opinion). This assumption is misguided\nfor two reasons. To start, the record\u2019s silence on this matter is to be\nexpected; the parties have consistently focused on the Secretary\u2019s\nauthority to take land into trust for the Tribe, not for individual mem\nbers of the Tribe. There is thus no legitimate basis for interpreting the\nlack of record evidence as affirmative proof that none of the Tribe\u2019s\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

If this case were about the Secretary\u2019s\ndecision to take land into trust for an individual who was\nincapable of proving her eligibility by lineage or blood\nquantum, I would have no trouble concluding that such an\naction was contrary to the IRA. But that is not the case\nbefore us. By taking land into trust for a validly recog\nnized Indian tribe, the Secretary acted well within his\nstatutory authority.10\n                            IV\n  The Court today adopts a cramped reading of a statute\nCongress intended to be \u201csweeping\u201d in scope. Morton v.\nMancari, 417 U. S. 535, 542 (1974). In so doing, the Court\nignores the \u201cprinciple deeply rooted in [our] Indian juris\nprudence\u201d that \u201c \u2018statutes are to be construed liberally in\nfavor of the Indians.\u2019 \u201d County of Yakima v. Confederated\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmembers are \u201cIndian.\u201d Second, neither the statute nor the relevant\nregulations mandate that a tribe have a threshold amount of blood\nquantum Indians as members in order to receive trust land. JUSTICE\nBREYER\u2019s unwarranted assumption about the Narragansett\u2019s member\nship, even if true, would therefore also be irrelevant to whether the\nSecretary\u2019s actions were proper.\n10 Petitioners advance the additional argument that the Secretary lacks\n\nauthority to take land into trust for the Narragansett because the\nRhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 92 Stat. 813, 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a71701 et seq., implicitly repealed the Secretary\u2019s \u00a7465 trust authority as\napplied to lands in Rhode Island. This claim plainly fails. While the\nTribe agreed to subject the 1,800 acres it obtained in the Settlement\nAct to the State\u2019s civil and criminal laws, \u00a71708(a), the 31-acre parcel of\nland at issue here was not part of the settlement lands. And, critically,\nnothing in the text of the Settlement Act suggests that Con-\ngress intended to prevent the Secretary from acquiring additional\nparcels of land in Rhode Island that would be exempt from the State\u2019s\njurisdiction.\n14                  CARCIERI v.

Argued November 3, 2008\u2014Decided February 24, 2009\nThe Indian Reorganization Act (IRA), enacted in 1934, authorizes the\n  Secretary of Interior, a respondent here, to acquire land and hold it\n  in trust \u201cfor the purpose of providing land for Indians,\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7465, and defines \u201cIndian\u201d to \u201cinclude all persons of Indian descent\n  who are members of any recognized tribe now under Federal jurisdic\n  tion,\u201d \u00a7479. The Narragansett Tribe was placed under the Colony of\n  Rhode Island\u2019s formal guardianship in 1709. It agreed to relinquish\n  its tribal authority and sell all but two acres of its remaining reserva\n  tion land in 1880, but then began trying to regain its land and tribal\n  status. From 1927 to 1937, federal authorities declined to give it as\n  sistance because they considered the Tribe to be under state, not fed\n  eral jurisdiction. In a 1978 agreement settling a dispute between the\n  Tribe and Rhode Island, the Tribe received title to 1,800 acres of land\n  in petitioner Charlestown in exchange for relinquishing claims to\n  state land based on aboriginal title; and it agreed that the land would\n  be subject to state law. The Tribe gained formal recognition from the\n  Federal Government in 1983, and the Secretary of Interior accepted a\n  deed of trust to the 1,800 acres in 1988. Subsequently, a dispute\n  arose over whether the Tribe\u2019s plans to build housing on an addi\n  tional 31 acres of land it had purchased complied with local regula\n  tions. While litigation was pending, the Secretary accepted the 31\n  acre parcel into trust. The Interior Board of Indian Appeals upheld\n  that decision, and petitioners sought review. The District Court\n  granted summary judgment to the Secretary and other officials, de\n  termining that \u00a7479\u2019s plain language defines \u201cIndian\u201d to include\n  members of all tribes in existence in 1934, but does not require a\n  tribe to have been federally recognized on that date; and concluding\n2                         CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    that, since the Tribe is currently federally recognized and was in ex\n    istence in 1934, it is a tribe under \u00a7479. In affirming, the First Cir\n    cuit found \u00a7479 ambiguous as to the meaning of \u201cnow under Federal\n    jurisdiction,\u201d applied the principles of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natu\n    ral Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843, and deferred\n    to the Secretary\u2019s construction of the provision to allow the land to be\n    taken into trust.\nHeld: Because the term \u201cnow under federal jurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7479 unam\n biguously refers to those tribes that were under federal jurisdiction\n when the IRA was enacted in 1934, and because the Narragansett\n Tribe was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, the Secretary does\n not have the authority to take the 31-acre parcel into trust. Pp. 7\u201316.\n    (a) When a statute\u2019s text is plain and unambiguous, United States\n v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 4, the statute must be applied according to\n its terms, see, e.g., Dodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 359. Here,\n whether the Secretary has authority to take the parcel into trust de\n pends on whether the Narragansetts are members of a \u201crecognized\n Indian Tribe now under Federal jurisdiction,\u201d which, in turn, depends\n on whether \u201cnow\u201d refers to 1998, when the Secretary accepted the\n parcel into trust, or 1934, when Congress enacted the IRA. The ordi\n nary meaning of \u201cnow,\u201d as understood at the time of enactment, was\n at \u201cthe present time; at this moment; at the time of speaking.\u201d That\n definition is consistent with interpretations given \u201cnow\u201d by this Court\n both before and after the IRA\u2019s passage. See e.g., Franklin v. United\n States, 216 U. S. 559, 569; Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308, 310\u2013\n 311. It also aligns with the word\u2019s natural reading in the context of\n the IRA. Furthermore, the Secretary\u2019s current interpretation is at\n odds with the Executive Branch\u2019s construction of \u00a7479 at the time of\n enactment. The Secretary\u2019s additional arguments in support of his\n contention that \u201cnow\u201d is ambiguous are unpersuasive. There is also\n no need to consider the parties\u2019 competing views on whether Con\n gress had a policy justification for limiting the Secretary\u2019s trust au\n thority to tribes under federal jurisdiction in 1934, since Congress\u2019\n use of \u201cnow\u201d in \u00a7479 speaks for itself and \u201ccourts must presume that\n a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute\n what it says there.\u201d Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S.\n 249, 253\u2013254. Pp. 7\u201313.\n    (b) The Court rejects alternative arguments by the Secretary and\n his amici that rely on statutory provisions other than \u00a7479 to support\n the Secretary\u2019s decision to take the parcel into trust for the Narra\n gansetts.

S. C.\n\u00a7465. The IRA defines the term \u201cIndian\u201d to \u201cinclude all\npersons of Indian descent who are members of any recog\nnized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7479.\nThe Secretary notified petitioners\u2014the State of Rhode\nIsland, its Governor, and the town of Charlestown, Rhode\nIsland\u2014that he intended to accept in trust a parcel of land\nfor use by the Narragansett Indian Tribe in accordance\nwith his claimed authority under the statute. In proceed\nings before the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA),\nthe District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the First\nCircuit, petitioners unsuccessfully challenged the Secre\ntary\u2019s authority to take the parcel into trust.\n  In reviewing the determination of the Court of Appeals,\nwe are asked to interpret the statutory phrase \u201cnow under\n2                  CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFederal jurisdiction\u201d in \u00a7479. Petitioners contend that the\nterm \u201cnow\u201d refers to the time of the statute\u2019s enactment,\nand permits the Secretary to take land into trust for mem\nbers of recognized tribes that were \u201cunder Federal juris\ndiction\u201d in 1934. The respondents argue that the word\n\u201cnow\u201d is an ambiguous term that can reasonably be con\nstrued to authorize the Secretary to take land into trust\nfor members of tribes that are \u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d\nat the time that the land is accepted into trust.\n  We agree with petitioners and hold that, for purposes of\n\u00a7479, the phrase \u201cnow under Federal jurisdiction\u201d refers to\na tribe that was under federal jurisdiction at the time of\nthe statute\u2019s enactment. As a result, \u00a7479 limits the\nSecretary\u2019s authority to taking land into trust for the\npurpose of providing land to members of a tribe that was\nunder federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in\nJune 1934. Because the record in this case establishes\nthat the Narragansett Tribe was not under federal juris\ndiction when the IRA was enacted, the Secretary does not\nhave the authority to take the parcel at issue into trust.\nWe reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                             I\n   At the time of colonial settlement, the Narragansett\nIndian Tribe was the indigenous occupant of much of what\nis now the State of Rhode Island. See Final Determina\ntion of Federal Acknowledgement of Narragansett Indian\nTribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (1983) (hereinaf\nter Final Determination). Initial relations between colo\nnial settlers, the Narragansett Tribe, and the other Indian\ntribes in the region were peaceful, but relations deterio\nrated in the late 17th century. The hostilities peaked in\n1675 and 1676 during the 2-year armed conflict known as\nKing Philip\u2019s War. Hundreds of colonists and thousands\nof Indians died. See E. Schultz & M. Tougias, King\nPhilip\u2019s War 5 (1999). The Narragansett Tribe, having\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

Reg. 6177.1\n   Not quite two centuries later, in 1880, the State of\nRhode Island convinced the Narragansett Tribe to relin\nquish its tribal authority as part of an effort to assimilate\ntribal members into the local population. See Narragan\nsett Indian Tribe v. National Indian Gaming Comm\u2019n, 158\nF. 3d 1335, 1336 (CADC 1998). The Tribe also agreed to\nsell all but two acres of its remaining reservation land for\n$5,000. Ibid. Almost immediately, the Tribe regretted its\ndecisions and embarked on a campaign to regain its land\nand tribal status. Ibid. In the early 20th century, mem\nbers of the Tribe sought economic support and other assis\ntance from the Federal Government. But, in correspon\ndence spanning a 10-year period from 1927 to 1937,\nfederal officials declined their request, noting that the\nTribe was, and always had been, under the jurisdiction\nof the New England States, rather than the Federal\nGovernment.\n   Having failed to gain recognition or assistance from the\nUnited States or from the State of Rhode Island, the Tribe\nfiled suit in the 1970\u2019s to recover its ancestral land, claim\ning that the State had misappropriated its territory in\nviolation of the Indian Non-Intercourse Act, 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7177.2 The claims were resolved in 1978 by enactment of\nthe Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 92 Stat.\n813, 25 U. S. C. \u00a71701 et seq. Under the agreement codi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Narragansett Tribe recognized today is the successor to two\n\ntribes, the Narragansett and the Niantic Tribes. The two predecessor\nTribes shared territory and cultural traditions at the time of European\nsettlement and effectively merged in the aftermath of King Philip\u2019s\nWar. See Final Determination, 48 Fed. Reg. 6177.\n   2 Title 25 U. S. C. \u00a7177 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o pur\n\nchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance of lands, or of any title or claim\nthereto, from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any\nvalidity in law or equity, unless the same be made by treaty or conven\ntion entered into pursuant to the Constitution.\u201d\n4                      CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfied by the Settlement Act, the Tribe received title to 1,800\nacres of land in Charlestown, Rhode Island, in exchange\nfor relinquishing its past and future claims to land based\non aboriginal title. The Tribe also agreed that the 1,800\nacres of land received under the Settlement Act \u201cshall be\nsubject to the civil and criminal laws and jurisdiction of\nthe State of Rhode Island.\u201d \u00a71708(a); see also \u00a71712(a).\n   The Narragansett Tribe\u2019s ongoing efforts to gain recog\nnition from the United States Government finally suc\nceeded in 1983. 48 Fed. Reg. 6177. In granting formal\nrecognition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) determined\nthat \u201cthe Narragansett community and its predecessors\nhave existed autonomously since first contact, despite\nundergoing many modifications.\u201d Id., at 6178. The BIA\nreferred to the Tribe\u2019s \u201cdocumented history dating from\n1614\u201d and noted that \u201call of the current membership are\nbelieved to be able to trace to at least one ancestor on the\nmembership lists of the Narragansett community pre\npared after the 1880 Rhode Island \u2018detribalization\u2019 act.\u201d\nIbid. After obtaining federal recognition, the Tribe began\nurging the Secretary to accept a deed of trust to the 1,800\nacres conveyed to it under the Rhode Island Indian Claims\nSettlement Act. 25 CFR \u00a783.2 (2008) (providing that\nfederal recognition is needed before an Indian tribe may\nseek \u201cthe protection, services, and benefits of the Federal\ngovernment\u201d). The Secretary acceded to the Tribe\u2019s re\nquest in 1988.

Narragansett Indian Tribe\nv. Narragansett Elec. Co., 89 F. 3d 908, 911\u2013912 (CA1\n1996). The Tribe\u2019s primary argument for noncompliance\u2014\nthat its ownership of the parcel made it a \u201cdependent\nIndian community\u201d and thus \u201cIndian country\u201d under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71151\u2014ultimately failed. 89 F. 3d, at 913\u2013922.\nBut, while the litigation was pending, the Tribe sought an\nalternative solution to free itself from compliance with\nlocal regulations: It asked the Secretary to accept the 31\nacre parcel into trust for the Tribe pursuant to 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7465. By letter dated March 6, 1998, the Secretary noti\nfied petitioners of his acceptance of the Tribe\u2019s land into\ntrust. Petitioners appealed the Secretary\u2019s decision to the\nIBIA, which upheld the Secretary\u2019s decision. See Town of\nCharlestown, Rhode Island v. Eastern Area Director,\nBureau of Indian Affairs, 35 IBIA 93 (2000).\n   Petitioners sought review of the IBIA decision pursuant\nto the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702. The\nDistrict Court granted summary judgment in favor of the\nSecretary and other Department of Interior officials. As\nrelevant here, the District Court determined that the plain\nlanguage of 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479 defines \u201cIndian\u201d to include\nmembers of all tribes in existence in 1934, but does not\nrequire a tribe to have been federally recognized on that\ndate. Carcieri v.

SALAZAR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, first\nin a panel decision, Carcieri v. Norton, 423 F. 3d 45 (2005),\nand then sitting en banc, 497 F. 3d 15 (CA1 2008). Al\nthough the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u201c[o]ne\nmight have an initial instinct to read the word \u2018now\u2019 [in\n\u00a7479] . . . to mean the date of [the] enactment of the stat\nute, June 18, 1934,\u201d the court concluded that there was\n\u201cambiguity as to whether to view the term . . . as operating\nat the moment Congress enacted it or at the moment the\nSecretary invokes it.\u201d Id., at 26. The Court of Appeals\nnoted that Congress has used the word \u201cnow\u201d in other\nstatutes to refer to the time of the statute\u2019s application,\nnot its enactment. Id., at 26\u201327. The Court of Appeals\nalso found that the particular statutory context of \u00a7479 did\nnot clarify the meaning of \u201cnow.\u201d On one hand, the Court\nof Appeals noted that another provision within the IRA, 25\nU. S. C. \u00a7472, uses the term \u201cnow or hereafter,\u201d which\nsupports petitioners\u2019 argument that \u201cnow,\u201d by itself, does\nnot refer to future events. But on the other hand, \u00a7479\ncontains the particular application date of \u201cJune 1, 1934,\u201d\nsuggesting that if Congress had wanted to refer to the\ndate of enactment, it could have done so more specifically.\n497 F. 3d, at 27. The Court of Appeals further reasoned\nthat both interpretations of \u201cnow\u201d are supported by rea\nsonable policy explanations, id., at 27\u201328, and it found\nthat the legislative history failed to \u201cclearly resolve the\nissue,\u201d id., at 28.\n   Having found the statute ambiguous, the Court of Ap\npeals applied the principles set forth in Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837, 843 (1984), and deferred to the Secretary\u2019s construc\ntion of the provision. 497 F. 3d, at 30. The court rejected\npetitioners\u2019 arguments that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation\nwas an impermissible construction of the statute. Id., at\n30\u201334.

That question, in turn, requires us to decide whether\nthe word \u201cnow under Federal jurisdiction\u201d refers to 1998,\nwhen the Secretary accepted the 31-acre parcel into trust,\nor 1934, when Congress enacted the IRA.\n   We begin with the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cnow,\u201d\nas understood when the IRA was enacted. Director, Office\nof Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collier\nies, 512 U. S. 267, 272 (1994); Moskal v. United States, 498\nU. S. 103, 108\u2013109 (1990). At that time, the primary\ndefinition of \u201cnow\u201d was \u201c[a]t the present time; at this\nmoment; at the time of speaking.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Inter\nnational Dictionary 1671 (2d ed. 1934); see also Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1262 (3d ed. 1933) (defining \u201cnow\u201d to\nmean \u201c[a]t this time, or at the present moment\u201d and noting\nthat \u201c \u2018[n]ow\u2019 as used in a statute ordinarily refers to the\ndate of its taking effect . . .\u201d (emphasis added)). This\ndefinition is consistent with interpretations given to the\nword \u201cnow\u201d by this Court, both before and after passage of\nthe IRA, with respect to its use in other statutes. See, e.g.,\nFranklin v. United States, 216 U.

S. C. \u00a7468 (referring\nto \u201cthe geographic boundaries of any Indian reservation\nnow existing or established hereafter\u201d); \u00a7472 (referring to\n\u201cIndians who may be appointed . . . to the various posi\ntions maintained, now or hereafter, by the Indian Office\u201d).\nCongress\u2019 use of the word \u201cnow\u201d in this provision, without\nthe accompanying phrase \u201cor hereafter,\u201d thus provides\nfurther textual support for the conclusion that the term\nrefers solely to events contemporaneous with the Act\u2019s\nenactment. See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S.\n438, 452 (2002) (\u201c[W]hen Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n   Furthermore, the Secretary\u2019s current interpretation is\nat odds with the Executive Branch\u2019s construction of this\nprovision at the time of enactment. In correspondence\nwith those who would assist him in implementing the IRA,\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier, ex\nplained that:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The current version of \u00a7465 provides \u201c[t]hat no part of such funds\n\nshall be used to acquire additional land outside of the exterior bounda\nries of Navajo Indian Reservation . . . in the event that legislation to\ndefine the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Indian Reservation in New\nMexico, and for other purposes, or similar legislation, becomes law.\u201d\n10                      CARCIERI v.

Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 476\n(1992), we agree with his conclusion that the word \u201cnow\u201d\nin \u00a7479 limits the definition of \u201cIndian,\u201d and therefore\nlimits the exercise of the Secretary\u2019s trust authority under\n\u00a7465 to those members of tribes that were under federal\njurisdiction at the time the IRA was enacted.\n   The Secretary makes two other arguments in support of\nhis contention that the term \u201cnow\u201d as used in \u00a7479 is\nambiguous. We reject them both. First, the Secretary\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 In addition to serving as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Col\n\nlier was \u201ca principal author of the [IRA].\u201d United States v. Mitchell, 463\nU. S. 206, 221, n. 21 (1983). And, as both parties note, he appears to\nhave been responsible for the insertion of the words \u201cnow under Federal\njurisdiction\u201d into what is now 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479. See Hearings on S.\n2755 et al.: A Bill to Grant Indians Living Under Federal Tutelage the\nFreedom to Organize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and\nEconomic Enterprise, before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs,\n73d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 266 (1934). Also, the record contains a\n1937 letter from Commissioner Collier in which, even after the passage\nof the IRA, he stated that the Federal Government still lacked any\njurisdiction over the Narragansett Tribe. App. 23a\u201324a. Commissioner\nCollier\u2019s responsibilities related to implementing the IRA make him an\nunusually persuasive source as to the meaning of the relevant statutory\nlanguage and the Tribe\u2019s status under it. See Christensen v. Harris\nCounty, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000) (explaining that an Executive Branch\nstatutory interpretation that lacks the force of law is \u201centitled to\nrespect . . . to the extent that those interpretations have the \u2018power to\npersuade\u2019 \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Here, the\nstatutory context makes clear that \u201cnow\u201d does not mean\n\u201cnow or hereafter\u201d or \u201cat the time of application.\u201d Had\nCongress intended to legislate such a definition, it could\nhave done so explicitly, as it did in \u00a7\u00a7468 and 472, or it\ncould have omitted the word \u201cnow\u201d altogether. Instead,\nCongress limited the statute by the word \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cwe\nare obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Con\ngress used.\u201d Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339\n(1979).\n   Second, the Secretary argues that \u00a7479 left a gap for the\nagency to fill by using the phrase \u201cshall include\u201d in its\nintroductory clause. Brief for Respondents 26\u201327. The\nSecretary, in turn, claims to have permissibly filled that\ngap by defining \u201c \u2018Tribe\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018Individual Indian\u2019 \u201d without\nreference to the date of the statute\u2019s enactment. Id., at 28\n(citing 25 CFR \u00a7\u00a7151.2(b), (c)(1) (2008)). But, as explained\nabove, Congress left no gap in 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479 for the\nagency to fill. Rather, it explicitly and comprehensively\ndefined the term by including only three discrete defini\ntions: \u201c[1] members of any recognized Indian tribe now\nunder Federal jurisdiction, and [2] all persons who are\ndescendants of such members who were, on June 1, 1934,\nresiding within the present boundaries of any Indian\nreservation, and . . . [3] all other persons of one-half or\nmore Indian blood.\u201d Ibid. In other statutory provisions,\nCongress chose to expand the Secretary\u2019s authority to\nparticular Indian tribes not necessarily encompassed\n12                        CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nwithin the definitions of \u201cIndian\u201d set forth in \u00a7479.6 Had it\nunderstood the word \u201cinclude\u201d in \u00a7479 to encompass tribes\nother than those satisfying one of the three \u00a7479 defini\ntions, Congress would have not needed to enact these\nadditional statutory references to specific Tribes.\n   The Secretary and his amici also go beyond the statu\ntory text to argue that Congress had no policy justification\nfor limiting the Secretary\u2019s trust authority to those tribes\nunder federal jurisdiction in 1934, because the IRA was\nintended to strengthen Indian communities as a whole,\nregardless of their status in 1934. Petitioners counter that\nthe main purpose of \u00a7465 was to reverse the loss of lands\nthat Indians sustained under the General Allotment Act,\nsee Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 U. S. 645, 650,\nn. 1 (2001), so the statute was limited to tribes under\nfederal jurisdiction at that time because they were the\ntribes who lost their lands. We need not consider these\ncompeting policy views, because Congress\u2019 use of the word\n\u201cnow\u201d in \u00a7479 speaks for itself and \u201ccourts must presume\nthat a legislature says in a statute what it means and\nmeans in a statute what it says there.\u201d Connecticut Nat.\nBank v.

We reject both arguments.\n   First, the Secretary and several amici argue that the\ndefinition of \u201cIndian\u201d in \u00a7479 is rendered irrelevant by the\nbroader definition of \u201ctribe\u201d in \u00a7479 and by the fact that\nthe statute authorizes the Secretary to take title to lands\n\u201cin the name of the United States in trust for the Indian\ntribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired. \u201d\n\u00a7465 (emphasis added); Brief for Respondents 12\u201314. But\nthe definition of \u201ctribe\u201d in \u00a7479 itself refers to \u201cany Indian\ntribe\u201d (emphasis added), and therefore is limited by the\ntemporal restrictions that apply to \u00a7479\u2019s definition of\n\u201cIndian.\u201d See \u00a7479 (\u201cThe term \u2018tribe\u2019 wherever used in this\nAct shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organ\nized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reserva\ntion\u201d (emphasis added)). And, although \u00a7465 authorizes\nthe United States to take land in trust for an Indian tribe,\n\u00a7465 limits the Secretary\u2019s exercise of that authority \u201cfor\nthe purpose of providing land for Indians.\u201d There simply\nis no legitimate way to circumvent the definition of \u201cIn\ndian\u201d in delineating the Secretary\u2019s authority under \u00a7\u00a7 465\nand 479. 8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 For this reason, we disagree with the argument made by JUSTICE\nSTEVENS that the term \u201cIndians\u201d in \u00a7465 has a different meaning than\nthe definition of \u201cIndian\u201d provided in \u00a7479, and that the term\u2019s meaning\nin \u00a7465 is controlled by later-enacted regulations governing the Secre\ntary\u2019s recognition of tribes like the Narragansetts. See post, at 4\u20136, 9\u2013\n11 (dissenting opinion). When Congress has enacted a definition with\n\u201cdetailed and unyielding provisions,\u201d as it has in \u00a7479, this Court must\ngive effect to that definition even when \u201c \u2018it could be argued that the\nline should have been drawn at a different point.\u2019 \u201d INS v.

C. \u00a72202, which was enacted\nas part of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA), Title\nII, 96 Stat. 2517, overcomes the limitations set forth in\n\u00a7479 and, in turn, authorizes the Secretary\u2019s action.\nSection 2202 provides:\n        \u201cThe provisions of section 465 of this title shall ap\n     ply to all tribes notwithstanding the provisions of sec\n     tion 478 of this title: Provided, That nothing in this\n     section is intended to supersede any other provision of\n     Federal law which authorizes, prohibits, or restricts\n     the acquisition of land for Indians with respect to any\n     specific tribe, reservation, or state(s).\u201d (Alteration in\n     original.)\nNCAI argues that the \u201cILCA independently grants author\nity under Section 465 for the Secretary to execute the\nchallenged trust acquisition.\u201d NCAI Brief 8. We do not\nagree.\n   The plain language of \u00a72202 does not expand the power\nset forth in \u00a7465, which requires that the Secretary take\nland into trust only \u201cfor the purpose of providing land for\nIndians.\u201d Nor does \u00a72202 alter the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d\nin \u00a7479, which is limited to members of tribes that were\nunder federal jurisdiction in 1934.9 See supra, at 7\u201312.\nRather, \u00a72202 by its terms simply ensures that tribes may\nbenefit from \u00a7465 even if they opted out of the IRA pursu\nant to \u00a7478, which allowed tribal members to reject the\napplication of the IRA to their tribe. \u00a7478 (\u201cThis Act shall\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 NCAI notes that the ILCA\u2019s definition of \u201ctribe\u201d \u201cmeans any Indian\n\ntribe, band, group, pueblo, or community for which, or for the members\nof which, the United States holds lands in trust.\u201d \u00a72201.

As a\nresult, there is no conflict between \u00a72202 and the limita\ntion on the Secretary\u2019s authority to take lands contained\nin \u00a7465. Rather, \u00a72202 provides additional protections to\nthose who satisfied the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d in \u00a7479 at the\ntime of the statute\u2019s enactment, but opted out of the IRA\nshortly thereafter.\n   NCAI\u2019s reading of \u00a72202 also would nullify the plain\nmeaning of the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d set forth in \u00a7479 and\nincorporated into \u00a7465. Consistent with our obligation to\ngive effect to every provision of the statute, Reiter, 442\nU.

Linguistically speaking, the word \u201cnow\u201d in\nthe phrase \u201cnow under Federal jurisdiction,\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a7479, may refer to a tribe\u2019s jurisdictional status as of 1934.\nBut one could also read it to refer to the time the Secre\ntary of the Interior exercises his authority to take land \u201cfor\nIndians.\u201d \u00a7465. Compare Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U. S.\n308, 311\u2013312 (1961) (\u201cnow\u201d refers to time of statutory\nenactment), with Difford v. Secretary of HHS, 910 F. 2d\n1316, 1320 (CA6 1990) (\u201cnow\u201d refers to time of exercise of\ndelegated authority); In re Lusk\u2019s Estate, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n467\u2013468, 9 A. 2d 363, 365 (1939) (property \u201cnow\u201d owned\nrefers to property owned when a will becomes operative).\nI also concede that the Court owes the Interior Depart\nment the kind of interpretive respect that reflects an\nagency\u2019s greater knowledge of the circumstances in which\na statute was enacted, cf. Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323\nU. S. 134 (1944). Yet because the Department then fa\nvored the Court\u2019s present interpretation, see infra, at 2,\nthat respect cannot help the Department here.\n  Neither can Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\n2                  CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), help the De\npartment. The scope of the word \u201cnow\u201d raises an interpre\ntive question of considerable importance; the provision\u2019s\nlegislative history makes clear that Congress focused\ndirectly upon that language, believing it definitively re\nsolved a specific underlying difficulty; and nothing in that\nhistory indicates that Congress believed departmental\nexpertise should subsequently play a role in fixing the\ntemporal reference of the word \u201cnow.\u201d These circum\nstances indicate that Congress did not intend to delegate\ninterpretive authority to the Department. Consequently,\nits interpretation is not entitled to Chevron deference,\ndespite linguistic ambiguity. See United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 227, 229\u2013230 (2001).\n   Second, I am persuaded that \u201cnow\u201d means \u201cin 1934\u201d not\nonly for the reasons the Court gives but also because an\nexamination of the provision\u2019s legislative history convinces\nme that Congress so intended. As I read that history, it\nshows that Congress expected the phrase would make\nclear that the Secretary could employ \u00a7465\u2019s power to take\nland into trust in favor only of those tribes in respect to\nwhich the Federal Government already had the kinds of\nobligations that the words \u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d\nimply. See Hearings on S. 2755 et al.: A Bill to Grant to\nIndians Living Under Federal Tutelage the Freedom to\nOrganize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and\nEconomic Enterprise, before the Senate Committee on\nIndian Affairs, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, pp. 263\u2013266\n(1934). Indeed, the very Department official who sug\ngested the phrase to Congress during the relevant legisla\ntive hearings subsequently explained its meaning in terms\nthat the Court now adopts. See Letter from John Collier,\nCommissioner, to Superintendents (Mar. 7, 1936), Lodging\nof Respondents (explaining that \u00a7479 included \u201cpersons of\nIndian descent who are members of any recognized tribe\nthat was under Federal jurisdiction at the date of the\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nAct\u201d).\n   Third, an interpretation that reads \u201cnow\u201d as meaning\n\u201cin 1934\u201d may prove somewhat less restrictive than it at\nfirst appears. That is because a tribe may have been\n\u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934 even though the\nFederal Government did not believe so at the time. We\nknow, for example, that following the Indian Reorganiza\ntion Act\u2019s enactment, the Department compiled a list of\n258 tribes covered by the Act; and we also know that it\nwrongly left certain tribes off the list. See Brief for Law\nProfessors Specializing in Federal Indian Law as Amicus\nCuriae 22\u201324; Quinn, Federal Acknowledgment of Ameri\ncan Indian Tribes: The Historical Development of a Legal\nConcept, 34 Am. J. Legal Hist. 331, 356\u2013359 (1990). The\nDepartment later recognized some of those tribes on\ngrounds that showed that it should have recognized them\nin 1934 even though it did not. And the Department has\nsometimes considered that circumstance sufficient to show\nthat a tribe was \u201cunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d in 1934\u2014\neven though the Department did not know it at the time.\n    The statute, after all, imposes no time limit upon rec\nognition. See \u00a7479 (\u201cThe term \u2018Indian\u2019 . . . shall include all\npersons of Indian descent who are members of any recog\nnized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction . . .\u201d\n(emphasis added)). And administrative practice suggests\nthat the Department has accepted this possibility. The\nDepartment, for example, did not recognize the Stilla\nguamish Tribe until 1976, but its reasons for recognition\nin 1976 included the fact that the Tribe had maintained\ntreaty rights against the United States since 1855. Con\nsequently, the Department concluded that land could be\ntaken into trust for the Tribe. See Memorandum from\nAssociate Solicitor, Indian Affairs to Assistant Secretary,\nIndian Affairs, Request for Reconsideration of Decision\nNot to Take Land in Trust for the Stillaguamish Tribe\n(Oct. 1, 1980), Lodging of Respondents 6\u20137. Similarly, in\n4                   CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\n1934 the Department thought that the Grand Traverse\nBand of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians had long since\nbeen dissolved. Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa & Chip\npewa Indians v. Office of U. S. Attorney for Western Dist.\nof Mich., 369 F. 3d 960, 961, and n. 2 (CA6 2004). But\nlater the Department recognized the Tribe, considering it\nto have existed continuously since 1675. 45 Fed. Reg.\n19321 (1980). Further, the Department in the 1930\u2019s\nthought that an anthropological study showed that the\nMole Lake Tribe no longer existed. But the Department\nlater decided that the study was wrong, and it then recog\nnized the Tribe. See Memorandum from the Solicitor to\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs 2758, 2762\u20132763 (Feb.\n8, 1937) (recognizing the Mole Lake Indians as a separate\ntribe).\n    In my view, this possibility\u2014that later recognition\nreflects earlier \u201cFederal jurisdiction\u201d\u2014explains some of\nthe instances of early Department administrative practice\nto which JUSTICE STEVENS refers. I would explain the\nother instances to which JUSTICE STEVENS refers as in\nvolving the taking of land \u201cfor\u201d a tribe with members who\nfall under that portion of the statute that defines \u201cIndians\u201d\nto include \u201cpersons of one-half or more Indian blood,\u201d \u00a7479.\nSee 1 Dept. of Interior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating\nto Indian Affairs, 1917\u20131974, pp. 706\u2013707 (Shoshone\nIndians), 724\u2013725 (St. Croix Chippewas), 747\u2013748 (Nahma\nand Beaver Indians) (1979).\n     Neither the Narragansett Tribe nor the Secretary has\nargued that the Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in\n1934. Nor have they claimed that any member of the\nNarragansett Tribe satisfies the \u201cone-half or more Indian\nblood\u201d requirement. And I have found nothing in the\nbriefs that suggests the Narragansett Tribe could prevail\non either theory. Each of the administrative decisions\njust discussed involved post-1934 recognition on grounds\nthat implied a 1934 relationship between the tribe and\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I can\nfind no similar indication of 1934 federal jurisdiction here.\nInstead, both the State and Federal Government consid\nered the Narragansett Tribe as under state, but not under\nfederal, jurisdiction in 1934. And until the 1970\u2019s there\nwas \u201clittle Federal contact with the Narragansetts as a\ngroup.\u201d Memorandum from Deputy Assistant Secretary\u2014\nIndian Affairs (Operations) to Assistant Scretary\u2014Indian\nAffairs, Recommendation and Summary of Evidence for\nProposed Finding for Federal Acknowledgment of Narra\ngansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island Pursuant to 25 CFR\n83, p. 8 (July 29, 1982). Because I see no realistic possi\nbility that the Narragansett Tribe could prevail on the\nbasis of a theory alternative to the theories argued here, I\nwould not remand this case.\n    With the qualifications here expressed, I join the\nCourt\u2019s opinion and its judgment.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I have, however, a further reservation\nthat puts me in the dissenting column.\n  The disposition of the case turns on the construction of\nthe language from 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479, \u201cany recognized In\ndian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction.\u201d Nothing in the\nmajority opinion forecloses the possibility that the two\nconcepts, recognition and jurisdiction, may be given sepa\nrate content. As JUSTICE BREYER makes clear in his\nconcurrence, the statute imposes no time limit upon rec\nognition, and in the past, the Department of the Interior\nhas stated that the fact that the United States Govern\nment was ignorant of a tribe in 1934 does not preclude\nthat tribe from having been under federal jurisdiction at\nthat time. See Memorandum from Associate Solicitor,\nIndian Affairs, to Assistant Secretary, Indian Affairs,\nRequest for Reconsideration of Decision Not to Take Land\nin Trust for the Stillaguamish Tribe (Oct. 1, 1980), Lodg\ning of Respondents 7.

SALAZAR\n\n                         Opinion of SOUTER, J.\n\nmeaning would be consistent with established principles of\nstatutory interpretation.\n   During oral argument, however, respondents explained\nthat the Secretary\u2019s more recent interpretation of this\nstatutory language had \u201cunderstood recognition and under\nFederal jurisdiction at least with respect to tribes to be\none and the same.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 42. Given the Secre\ntary\u2019s position, it is not surprising that neither he nor the\nTribe raised a claim that the Tribe was under federal\njurisdiction in 1934: they simply failed to address an issue\nthat no party understood to be present. The error was\nshared equally all around, and there is no equitable de\nmand that one side be penalized when both sides nodded.\n   I can agree with JUSTICE BREYER that the current re\ncord raises no particular reason to expect that the Tribe\nmight be shown to have been under federal jurisdiction in\n1934, but I would not stop there. The very notion of juris\ndiction as a distinct statutory condition was ignored in\nthis litigation, and I know of no body of precedent or his\ntory of practice giving content to the condition sufficient\nfor gauging the Tribe\u2019s chances of satisfying it. So I see no\nreason to deny the Secretary and the Narragansett Tribe\nan opportunity to advocate a construction of the \u201cjurisdic\ntion\u201d phrase that might favor their position here.\n   I would therefore reverse and remand with opportunity\nfor respondents to pursue a \u201cjurisdiction\u201d claim and re\nspectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s straight reversal.*\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Depending on the outcome of proceedings on remand, it might be\nnecessary to address the second potential issue in this case, going to the\nsignificance of the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 25\nU.

The Act specifies that benefits shall be\navailable to individuals who qualify as Indian either as a\nresult of blood quantum or as descendants of members of\n\u201cany recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdic\ntion.\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479. In contesting the Secretary of the\nInterior\u2019s acquisition of trust land for the Narragansett\nTribe of Rhode Island, the parties have focused on the\nmeaning of \u201cnow\u201d in the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian.\u201d Yet to\nmy mind, whether \u201cnow\u201d means 1934 (as the Court holds)\nor the present time (as respondents would have it) sheds\nno light on the question whether the Secretary\u2019s actions on\nbehalf of the Narragansett were permitted under the\nstatute. The plain text of the Act clearly authorizes the\nSecretary to take land into trust for Indian tribes as well\nas individual Indians, and it places no temporal limitation\non the definition of \u201cIndian tribe.\u201d1 Because the Narra\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In 25 U.

Although\nit was once one of the most powerful tribes in New Eng\nland, a series of wars, epidemics, and difficult relations\nwith the State of Rhode Island sharply reduced the Tribe\u2019s\nancestral landholdings.\n   Two blows, delivered centuries apart, exacted a particu\nlarly high toll on the Tribe. First, in 1675, King Philip\u2019s\nWar essentially destroyed the Tribe, forcing it to accept\nthe Crown as sovereign and to submit to the guardianship\nof the Colony of Rhode Island. Then, in 1880, the State of\nRhode Island passed a \u201cdetribalization\u201d law that abolished\ntribal authority, ended the State\u2019s guardianship of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   \u201cThe term \u2018Indian\u2019 as used in this Act shall include all persons of\nIndian descent who are members of any recognized Indian tribe now\nunder Federal jurisdiction, and all persons who are descendants of such\nmembers who were, on June 1, 1934, residing within the present\nboundaries of any Indian reservation, and shall further include\nall other persons of one-half or more Indian blood. . . . The term\n\u2018tribe\u2019 wherever used in this Act shall be construed to refer to\nany Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one\nreservation.\u201d\n   Notably the word \u201cnow,\u201d which is used to define one of the categories\nof Indians, does not appear in the definition of \u201ctribe.\u201d\n   2 In 1991, the Narragansett Tribe purchased the 31-acre parcel in fee\n\nsimple from a private developer. In 1998, the Bureau of Indian Affairs\nnotified the State of the Secretary\u2019s decision to take the land into\nunreserved trust for the Tribe. The Tribe \u201cacquired [the land] for the\nexpress purpose of building much needed low-income Indian Housing\nvia a contract between the Narragansett Indian Wetuomuck Housing\nAuthority (NIWHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Devel\nopment (HUD).\u201d App. 46a.\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

The Narra\ngansett originally assented to detribalization and ceded all\nbut two acres of its ancestral land. In return, the Tribe\nreceived $5,000. See Memorandum from the Deputy\nAssistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Operations) to Assis\ntant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Operations) 4 (July 19,\n1982) (Recommendation for Acknowledgment).\n   Recognizing that its consent to detribalization was a\nmistake, the Tribe embarked on a century-long campaign\nto recoup its losses.3 Obtaining federal recognition was\ncritical to this effort. The Secretary officially recognized\nthe Narragansett as an Indian tribe in 1983, Final Deter\nmination for Federal Acknowledgement of Narragansett\nIndian Tribe of Rhode Island, 48 Fed.

The Tribe\u2019s\nattempt to exercise one of those rights, the ability to peti\ntion the Secretary to take land into trust for the Tribe\u2019s\nbenefit, is now vigorously contested in this litigation.\n                            II\n  The Secretary\u2019s trust authority is located in 25 U.

An individual Indian, \u00a7479 tells us, \u201cshall include\nall persons of Indian descent who are members of any\nrecognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction\u201d as\nwell as \u201call other persons of one-half or more Indian\nblood.\u201d A tribe, \u00a7479 goes on to state, \u201cshall be construed\nto refer to any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, or the\nIndians residing on one reservation.\u201d Because federal\nrecognition is generally required before a tribe can receive\nfederal benefits, the Secretary has interpreted this defini\ntion of \u201ctribe\u201d to refer only to recognized tribes. See 25\nCFR \u00a783.2 (2008) (stating that recognition \u201cis a prerequi\nsite to the protection, services, and benefits of the Federal\ngovernment available to Indian tribes by virtue of their\nstatus as tribes\u201d); \u00a7151.2 (defining \u201ctribe\u201d for the purposes\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 Section\n            465 reads more fully:\n  \u201cThe Secretary of the Interior is authorized, in his discretion, to\nacquire, through purchase, relinquishment, gift, exchange, or assign\nment, any interest in lands, water rights, or surface rights to lands,\nwithin or without existing reservations, including trust or otherwise\nrestricted allotments whether the allottee be living or deceased, for the\npurpose of providing land for Indians.\n         .            .              .              .              .\n  \u201cTitle to any lands or rights acquired pursuant to this Act . . . shall be\ntaken in the name of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe or\nindividual Indian for which the land is acquired, and such lands or\nrights shall be exempt from State and local taxation.\u201d\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

The\nstatute reflects Congress\u2019 intent to extend certain benefits\nto individual Indians, e.g., 25 U. S. C. \u00a7471 (offering loans\nto Indian students for tuition at vocational and trade\nschools); \u00a7472 (granting hiring preferences to Indians\nseeking federal employment related to Indian affairs),\nwhile directing other benefits to tribes, e.g., \u00a7476 (allowing\ntribes to adopt constitutions and bylaws); \u00a7470 (giving\nloans to Indian-chartered corporations).\n   Section 465, by giving the Secretary discretion to steer\nbenefits to tribes and individuals alike, is therefore\nunique. But establishing this broad benefit scheme was\nundoubtedly intentional: The original draft of the IRA\npresented to Congress directed the Secretary to take land\ninto trust only for entities such as tribes. Compare H. R.\n7902, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 30 (1934) (\u201cTitle to any land\nacquired pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be\ntaken in the name of the United States in trust for the\nIndian tribe or community for whom the land is acquired\u201d\n(emphasis added)), with 25 U.

Thus, contrary to the argument pressed by the Governor of Rhode\nIsland before this Court, see Reply Brief for Petitioner Carcieri 9, the\nrequirement that a tribe be federally recognized before it is eligible for\ntrust land does not stem from the IRA.\n6                   CARCIERI v.

In the years immedi\nately following the adoption of the IRA, the Solicitor of the\nDepartment of the Interior repeatedly advised that the\nSecretary could take land into trust for federally recog\nnized tribes and for individual Indians who qualified for\nfederal benefits by lineage or blood quantum.\n   For example, in 1937, when evaluating whether the\nSecretary could purchase approximately 2,100 acres of\nland for the Mole Lake Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin,\nthe Solicitor instructed that the purchase could not be\n\u201ccompleted until it is determined whether the beneficiary\nof the trust title should be designated as a band or\nwhether the title should be taken for the individual Indi\nans in the vicinity of Mole Lake who are of one half or\nmore Indian blood.\u201d Memorandum from the Solicitor to\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs 2758 (Feb. 8, 1937).\nBecause the Mole Lake Chippewa was not yet recognized\nby the Federal Government as an Indian tribe, the Solici\ntor determined that the Secretary had two options: \u201cEither\nthe Department should provide recognition of this group,\nor title to the purchased land should be taken on behalf of\nthe individuals who are of one half or more Indian blood.\u201d\nId., at 2763.\n   The tribal trust and individual trust options were simi\nlarly outlined in other post-1934 opinion letters, including\nthose dealing with the Shoshone Indians of Nevada, the\nSt. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, and the Nahma\nand Beaver Island Indians of Michigan. See 1 Dept. of\nInterior, Opinions of the Solicitor Relating to Indian Af\nfairs, 1917\u20131974, pp. 706\u2013707, 724\u2013725, 747\u2013748 (1979).\nUnless and until a tribe was formally recognized by the\nFederal Government and therefore eligible for trust land,\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

Absent a specific statute recognizing a tribe\nand authorizing a trust land acquisition,7 the Secretary\nhas exercised his trust authority\u2014now governed by regu\nlations promulgated in 1980 after notice-and-comment\nrulemaking, 25 CFR \u00a7151 et seq.; 45 Fed. Reg. 62034\u2014to\nacquire land for federally recognized Indian tribes like the\nNarragansett. The Grand Traverse Band of Ottowa and\nChippewa Indians, although denied federal recognition in\n1934 and 1943, see Dept. of Interior, Office of Federal\nAcknowledgement, Memorandum from Acting Deputy\nCommissioner to Assistant Secretary 4 (Oct. 3, 1979)\n(GTB\u2013V001\u2013D002), was the first tribe the Secretary rec\nognized under the 1980 regulations, see 45 Fed. Reg.\n19322. Since then, the Secretary has used his trust au\nthority to expand the Tribe\u2019s land base. See, e.g., 49 Fed.\nReg. 2025\u20132026 (1984) (setting aside a 12.5-acre parcel as\nreservation land for the Tribe\u2019s exclusive use). The Tu\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Although   Congress has passed specific statutes granting the Secre\ntary authority to take land into trust for certain tribes, it would be a\nmistake to conclude that the Secretary lacks residual authority to take\nland into trust under 25 U. S. C. \u00a7465 of the IRA. Some of these stat\nutes place explicit limits on the Secretary\u2019s trust authority and can be\nproperly read as establishing the outer limit of the Secretary\u2019s trust\nauthority with respect to the specified tribes. See, e.g., \u00a71724(d) (au\nthorizing trust land for the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the\nPassamaquoddy Tribe of Maine, and the Penobscot Tribe of Maine).\nOther statutes, while identifying certain parcels the Secretary will take\ninto trust for a tribe, do not purport to diminish the Secretary\u2019s residual\nauthority under \u00a7465. See, e.g., \u00a71775c(a) (Mohegan Tribe); \u00a71771d\n(Wampanoag Tribe); \u00a71747(a) (Miccosukee Tribe). Indeed, the Secre\ntary has invoked his \u00a7465 authority to take additional land into trust\nfor the Miccosukee Tribe despite the existence of a statute authorizing\nand directing him to acquire certain land for the Tribe. See Post-\nArgument En Banc Brief for National Congress of American Indians\net al. as Amici Curiae 7 and App. 9 in No. 03\u20132647 (CA1).\n8                   CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nnica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana has similarly benefited from\nadministrative recognition, 46 Fed. Reg. 38411 (1981),\nfollowed by tribal trust acquisition. And in 2006, the\nSecretary took land into trust for the Snoqualmie Tribe\nwhich, although unrecognized as an Indian tribe in the\n1950\u2019s, regained federal recognition in 1999. See 71 Fed.\nReg. 5067 (taking land into trust for the Tribe); 62 Fed.\nReg. 45864 (1997) (recognizing the Snoqualmie as an\nIndian tribe).\n   This brief history of \u00a7465 places the case before us into\nproper context. Federal recognition, regardless of when it\nis conferred, is the necessary condition that triggers a\ntribe\u2019s eligibility to receive trust land. No party has dis\nputed that the Narragansett Tribe was properly recog\nnized as an Indian tribe in 1983. See 48 Fed. Reg. 6177.\nIndeed, given that the Tribe has a documented history\nthat stretches back to 1614 and has met the rigorous\ncriteria for administrative recognition, Recommendation\nfor Acknowledgment 1, 7\u201318, it would be difficult to sus\ntain an objection to the Tribe\u2019s status. With this in mind,\nand in light of the Secretary\u2019s longstanding authority\nunder the plain text of the IRA to acquire tribal trust land,\nit is perfectly clear that the Secretary\u2019s land acquisition\nfor the Narragansett was entirely proper.\n                              III\n   Despite the clear text of the IRA and historical pedigree\nof the Secretary\u2019s actions on behalf of the Narragansett,\nthe majority holds that one word (\u201cnow\u201d) nestled in one\nclause in one of \u00a7479\u2019s several definitions demonstrates\nthat the Secretary acted outside his statutory authority in\nthis case. The consequences of the majority\u2019s reading are\nboth curious and harsh: curious because it turns \u201cnow\u201d\ninto the most important word in the IRA, limiting not only\nsome individuals\u2019 eligibility for federal benefits but also a\ntribe\u2019s; harsh because it would result in the unsupportable\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S. C. \u00a7465 (emphasis added), it\nmeant to permit land acquisitions for those persons whose\ntribal membership qualify them as \u201cIndian\u201d as defined by\n\u00a7479. In other words, the argument runs, the Secretary\ncan acquire trust land for \u201cpersons of Indian descent who\nare members of any recognized Indian tribe now under\nFederal jurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7479. This strained construction,\nadvanced by petitioners, explains the majority\u2019s laser-like\nfocus on the meaning of \u201cnow\u201d: If the Narragansett Tribe\nwas not recognized or under federal jurisdiction in 1934,\nthe Tribe\u2019s members do not belong to an Indian tribe \u201cnow\nunder Federal jurisdiction\u201d and would therefore not be\n\u201cIndians\u201d under \u00a7465 by virtue of their tribal membership.\n   Petitioners\u2019 argument works only if one reads \u201cIndians\u201d\n(in the phrase in \u00a7465 \u201cproviding land for Indians\u201d) to\nrefer to individuals, not an Indian tribe. To petitioners,\nthis reading is obvious; the alternative, they insist, would\nbe \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner State of Rhode\nIsland 3. This they argue despite the clear evidence of\nCongress\u2019 intent to provide the Secretary with the option\nof acquiring either tribal trusts or individual trusts in\nservice of \u201cproviding land for Indians.\u201d And they ignore\nunambiguous evidence that Congress used \u201cIndian tribe\u201d\nand \u201cIndians\u201d interchangeably in other parts of the IRA.\nSee \u00a7475 (discussing \u201cany claim or suit of any Indian tribe\nagainst the United States\u201d in the first sentence and \u201cany\nclaim of such Indians against the United States\u201d in the\nlast sentence (emphasis added)).\n   In any event, this much must be admitted: Without the\nbenefit of context, a reasonable person could conclude that\n\u201cIndians\u201d refers to multiple individuals who each qualify\n10                     CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas \u201cIndian\u201d under the IRA. An equally reasonable person\ncould also conclude that \u201cIndians\u201d is meant to refer to a\ncollective, namely, an Indian tribe. Because \u201c[t]he mean\ning\u2014or ambiguity\u2014of certain words or phrases may only\nbecome evident when placed in context,\u201d FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132 (2000), the\nproper course of action is to widen the interpretive lens\nand look to the rest of the statute for clarity. Doing so\nwould lead to \u00a7465\u2019s last sentence, which specifies that the\nSecretary is to hold land in trust \u201cfor the Indian tribe or\nindividual Indian for which the land is acquired.\u201d Put\nsimply, in \u00a7465 Congress used the term \u201cIndians\u201d to refer\nboth to tribes and individuals.8\n   The majority nevertheless dismisses this reading of the\nstatute. The Court notes that even if the Secretary has\nauthority to take land into trust for a tribe, it must be an\n\u201cIndian tribe,\u201d with \u00a7479\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian\u201d determin\ning a tribe\u2019s eligibility. The statute\u2019s definition of \u201ctribe,\u201d\nthe majority goes on to state, itself makes reference to\n\u201cIndian tribe.\u201d Thus, the Court concludes, \u201c[t]here simply\nis no legitimate way to circumvent the definition of \u2018In\ndian\u2019 in delineating the Secretary\u2019s authority under \u00a7479.\u201d\nAnte, at 13.\n   The majority bypasses a straightforward explanation on\nits way to a circular one. Requiring that a tribe be an\n\u201cIndian tribe\u201d does not demand immediate reference to the\ndefinition of \u201cIndian\u201d; instead, it simply reflects the re\nquirement that the tribe in question be formally recog\nnized as an Indian tribe. As explained above, the Secre\ntary has limited benefits under federal Indian law\u2014\nincluding the acquisition of trust land\u2014to recognized\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority continues to insist, quite incorrectly, that Congress\nmeant the term \u201cIndians\u201d in \u00a7465 to have the same meaning as the\nterm \u201cIndian\u201d in \u00a7479. That the text of the statute tells a different\nstory appears to be an inconvenience the Court would rather ignore.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntribes. Recognition, then, is the central requirement for\nbeing considered an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d for purposes of the Act.\nIf a tribe satisfies the stringent criteria established by the\nSecretary to qualify for federal recognition, including the\nrequirement that the tribe prove that it \u201chas existed as a\ncommunity from historical times until the present,\u201d 25\nCFR \u00a783.7(b) (2008), it is a fortiori an \u201cIndian tribe\u201d as a\nmatter of law.\n   The Narragansett Tribe is no different. In 1983, upon\nmeeting the criteria for recognition, the Secretary gave\nnotice that \u201cthe Narragansett Indian Tribe . . . exists as an\nIndian tribe.\u201d 48 Fed. Reg. 6177 (emphasis added). How\nthe Narragansett could be an Indian tribe in 1983 and yet\nnot be an Indian tribe today is a proposition the majority\ncannot explain.\n   The majority\u2019s retort, that because \u201ctribe\u201d refers to\n\u201cIndian,\u201d the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d must control which\ngroups can be considered a \u201ctribe,\u201d is entirely circular.\nYes, the word \u201ctribe\u201d is defined in part by reference to\n\u201cIndian tribe.\u201d But the word \u201cIndian\u201d is also defined in\npart by reference to \u201cIndian tribe.\u201d Relying on one defini\ntion to provide content to the other is thus \u201ccompletely\ncircular and explains nothing.\u201d Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.\nv. Darden, 503 U. S. 318, 323 (1992).\n   The Governor of Rhode Island, for his part, adopts this\ncircular logic and offers two examples of why reading the\nstatute any other way would be implausible. He first\nargues that if \u00a7479\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian\u201d does not deter\nmine a tribe\u2019s eligibility, the Secretary would have author\nity to take land into trust \u201cfor the benefit of any group that\nhe deems, at his whim and fancy, to be an \u2018Indian tribe.\u2019 \u201d\nReply Brief for Petitioner Carcieri 7. The Governor carica\ntures the Secretary\u2019s discretion. This Court has long made\nclear that Congress\u2014and therefore the Secretary\u2014lacks\nconstitutional authority to \u201cbring a community or body of\npeople within [federal jurisdiction] by arbitrarily calling\n12                      CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthem an Indian tribe.\u201d United States v. Sandoval, 231\nU. S. 28, 46 (1913). The Governor\u2019s next objection, that\ncondoning the acquisition of trust land for the Narragan\nsett Tribe would allow the Secretary to acquire land for an\nIndian tribe that lacks Indians, is equally unpersuasive.\nAs a general matter, to obtain federal recognition, a tribe\nmust demonstrate that its \u201cmembership consists of indi\nviduals who descend from a historical Indian tribe or from\nhistorical Indian tribes which combined and functioned as\na single autonomous political entity.\u201d 25 CFR \u00a783.7(e)\n(2008). If the Governor suspects that the Narragansett is\nnot an Indian tribe because it may lack members who are\nblood quantum Indians, he should have challenged the\nSecretary\u2019s decision to recognize the Tribe in 1983 when\nsuch an objection could have been properly received.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The  Department of the Interior found \u201ca high degree of retention of\n[Narragansett] family lines\u201d between 1880 and 1980, and remarked\nthat \u201c[t]he close intermarriage and stability of composition, plus the\ngeographic stability of the group, reflect the maintenance of a socially\ndistinct community.\u201d Recommendation for Acknowledgment 10. It also\nnoted that the Narragansett \u201crequire applicants for full voting mem\nbership to trace their Narragansett Indian bloodlines back to the\n\u2018Detribalization Rolls of 1880\u201384.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 16. The record in this case\ndoes not tell us how many members of the Narragansett currently\nqualify as \u201cIndian\u201d by meeting the individual blood quantum require\nment. Indeed, it is possible that a significant number of the Narragan\nsett are blood quantum Indians. Accordingly, nothing the Court\ndecides today prevents the Secretary from taking land into trust for\nthose members of the Tribe who independently qualify as \u201cIndian\u201d\nunder 25 U. S. C. \u00a7479.\n  Although the record does not demonstrate how many members of the\nNarragansett qualify as blood quantum Indians, JUSTICE BREYER\nnevertheless assumes that no member of the Tribe is a blood quantum\nIndian. Ante, at 4 (concurring opinion). This assumption is misguided\nfor two reasons. To start, the record\u2019s silence on this matter is to be\nexpected; the parties have consistently focused on the Secretary\u2019s\nauthority to take land into trust for the Tribe, not for individual mem\nbers of the Tribe. There is thus no legitimate basis for interpreting the\nlack of record evidence as affirmative proof that none of the Tribe\u2019s\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

If this case were about the Secretary\u2019s\ndecision to take land into trust for an individual who was\nincapable of proving her eligibility by lineage or blood\nquantum, I would have no trouble concluding that such an\naction was contrary to the IRA. But that is not the case\nbefore us. By taking land into trust for a validly recog\nnized Indian tribe, the Secretary acted well within his\nstatutory authority.10\n                            IV\n  The Court today adopts a cramped reading of a statute\nCongress intended to be \u201csweeping\u201d in scope. Morton v.\nMancari, 417 U. S. 535, 542 (1974). In so doing, the Court\nignores the \u201cprinciple deeply rooted in [our] Indian juris\nprudence\u201d that \u201c \u2018statutes are to be construed liberally in\nfavor of the Indians.\u2019 \u201d County of Yakima v. Confederated\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmembers are \u201cIndian.\u201d Second, neither the statute nor the relevant\nregulations mandate that a tribe have a threshold amount of blood\nquantum Indians as members in order to receive trust land. JUSTICE\nBREYER\u2019s unwarranted assumption about the Narragansett\u2019s member\nship, even if true, would therefore also be irrelevant to whether the\nSecretary\u2019s actions were proper.\n10 Petitioners advance the additional argument that the Secretary lacks\n\nauthority to take land into trust for the Narragansett because the\nRhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 92 Stat. 813, 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a71701 et seq., implicitly repealed the Secretary\u2019s \u00a7465 trust authority as\napplied to lands in Rhode Island. This claim plainly fails. While the\nTribe agreed to subject the 1,800 acres it obtained in the Settlement\nAct to the State\u2019s civil and criminal laws, \u00a71708(a), the 31-acre parcel of\nland at issue here was not part of the settlement lands. And, critically,\nnothing in the text of the Settlement Act suggests that Con-\ngress intended to prevent the Secretary from acquiring additional\nparcels of land in Rhode Island that would be exempt from the State\u2019s\njurisdiction.\n14                  CARCIERI v. SALAZAR\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nTribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269\n(1992) (quoting Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, 471 U. S. 759,\n767\u2013768 (1985)); see also Cohen \u00a72.02[1], p. 119 (\u201cThe\nbasic Indian law canons of construction require that trea\nties, agreements, statutes, and executive orders be liber\nally construed in favor of the Indians\u201d).\n   Given that the IRA plainly authorizes the Secretary to\ntake land into trust for an Indian tribe, and in light of the\nNarragansett\u2019s status as such, the Court\u2019s decision can be\nbest understood as protecting one sovereign (the State)\nfrom encroachment from another (the Tribe). Yet in mat\nters of Indian law, the political branches have been en\ntrusted to mark the proper boundaries between tribal and\nstate jurisdiction. See U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3; Cotton\nPetroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163, 192 (1989);\nWorcester v.

With the\nIRA, Congress drew the boundary in a manner that favors\nthe Narragansett. I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
