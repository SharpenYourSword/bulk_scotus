Argued November 3, 2008\u2014Decided February 24, 2009\nIdaho\u2019s Right to Work Act permits public employees to authorize pay\n  roll deductions for general union dues, but prohibits such deductions\n  for union political activities. Respondents\u2014a group of Idaho public\n  employee unions\u2014sued, alleging that the ban on payroll deductions\n  for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amend\n  ments. The District Court upheld the ban at the state level, but\n  struck it down as it applies to local governments. In affirming, the\n  Ninth Circuit stated that, while Idaho has the ultimate control over\n  local governmental units, it did not actually operate or control their\n  payroll deduction systems. The court applied strict scrutiny to hold\n  that the statute was unconstitutional as applied at the local level.\nHeld: Idaho\u2019s ban on political payroll deductions, as applied to local\n governmental units, does not infringe the unions\u2019 First Amendment\n rights. Pp. 5\u201311.\n    (a) Content-based restrictions on speech are \u201cpresumptively inva\n lid\u201d and subject to strict scrutiny. Davenport v. Washington Ed.\n Assn., 551 U. S. 177, ___. The First Amendment does not, however,\n impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech. See Regan\n v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549. Idaho\u2019s\n law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote\n that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activi\n ties. Idaho\u2019s public employee unions are free to engage in such\n speech as they see fit. They simply are barred from enlisting the\n State in support of that endeavor. Idaho\u2019s decision to limit public\n employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions\u2019\n First Amendment rights. The State accordingly need only demon\n strate a rational basis to justify the ban. Idaho\u2019s justification is the\n2                  YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED.

See, e.g., Civil Service\n    Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U. S. 548, 565. And the State\u2019s re\n    sponse to the problem is limited to its source\u2014political payroll deduc\n    tions.

Pp. 5\u2013\n    8.\n       (b) The ban at issue is valid at the local level. The same deferential\n    review applies whether the ban is directed at state or local govern\n    mental entities. Political subdivisions have never been considered\n    sovereign entities but are instead \u201csubordinate governmental in\n    strumentalities.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575. The State\u2019s\n    legislative action is subject to First Amendment scrutiny whether it\n    is applicable at the state level, the local level, both, or some subpart\n    of either, but no case suggests that a different analysis applies de\n    pending on the level of government affected. The ban furthers\n    Idaho\u2019s interest in separating the operation of government from par\n    tisan politics, and that interest extends to all public employers at\n    whatever level of government.

POCATELLO EDUCATION \n\n             ASSOCIATION ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 24, 2009] \n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   Under Idaho law, a public employee may elect to have a\nportion of his wages deducted by his employer and remit\nted to his union to pay union dues. He may not, however,\nchoose to have an amount deducted and remitted to the\nunion\u2019s political action committee, because Idaho law\nprohibits payroll deductions for political activities. A\ngroup of unions representing Idaho public employees\nchallenged this limitation. They conceded that the limita\ntion was valid as applied at the state level, but argued\nthat it violated their First Amendment rights when ap\nplied to county, municipal, school district, and other local\npublic employers.\n   We do not agree. The First Amendment prohibits gov\nernment from \u201cabridging the freedom of speech\u201d; it does\nnot confer an affirmative right to use government payroll\nmechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expres\nsion. Idaho\u2019s law does not restrict political speech, but\nrather declines to promote that speech by allowing public\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nemployee checkoffs for political activities. Such a decision\nis reasonable in light of the State\u2019s interest in avoiding the\nappearance that carrying out the public\u2019s business is\ntainted by partisan political activity. That interest ex\ntends to government at the local as well as state level, and\nnothing in the First Amendment prevents a State from\ndetermining that its political subdivisions may not provide\npayroll deductions for political activities.\n                                I\n   Idaho\u2019s Right to Work Act declares that the \u201cright to\nwork shall not be infringed or restricted in any way based\non membership in, affiliation with, or financial support of\na labor organization or on refusal to join, affiliate with, or\nfinancially or otherwise support a labor organization.\u201d\n1985 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 2, \u00a71 (codified at Idaho Code\n\u00a744\u20132001 (Michie 2003)). As part of that policy, the Act\nprohibits any requirement for the payment of dues or fees\nto a labor organization as a condition of employment, \u00a744\u2013\n2003, but authorizes employers to deduct union fees from\nan employee\u2019s wages with the employee\u2019s \u201csigned written\nauthorization,\u201d \u00a744\u20132004(1). The Act covers all employ\nees, \u201cincluding all employees of the state and its political\nsubdivisions.\u201d \u00a744\u20132011.\n   Prior to 2003, employees could authorize both a payroll\ndeduction for general union dues and a payroll deduction\nfor union political activities conducted through a political\naction committee. App. 55\u201356, 83\u201384. In 2003, the Idaho\nLegislature passed the Voluntary Contributions Act\n(VCA). 2003 Sess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho\nCode \u00a7\u00a744\u20132601 through 44\u20132605, and \u00a744\u20132004). That\nlegislation, among other things, amended the Right to\nWork Act by adding a prohibition on payroll deductions for\npolitical purposes. That amendment provides: \u201cDeduc\ntions for political activities as defined in chapter 26, title\n44, Idaho Code, shall not be deducted from the wages,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Violations of\n\u00a744\u20132004(2) are punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000\nor up to 90 days of imprisonment, or both. \u00a744\u20132007.\n   Shortly before the VCA was to take effect, plaintiff labor\norganizations sued the Bannock County prosecuting at\ntorney, the Idaho secretary of state, and the Idaho attor\nney general in their official capacities, alleging that the\nban on political payroll deductions was unconstitutional\nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the\nUnited States Constitution. App. 18\u201341.1 The District\nCourt rejected that argument with respect to public em\nployers at the state level, concluding that the First\nAmendment does not compel the State \u201cto subsidize\nspeech by providing, at its own expense, payroll deduc\ntions for the purpose of paying union dues or association\nfees for State employees.\u201d Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Heide\nman, 2005 WL 3241745, *2 (D Idaho, Nov. 23, 2005). The\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The unions also challenged other provisions of the VCA, including\n\none requiring labor organizations to establish a \u201cseparate segregated\nfund\u201d for political activities. Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a744\u20132601 through 44\u20132605\n(Michie 2002); see App. 27\u201334. In response to that challenge, the State\nagreed to strike \u201call of the VCA except for its ban on political payroll\ndeductions.\u201d Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Heideman, 2005 WL 3241745, *1 (D\nIdaho, Nov. 23, 2005). The State asserted that the ban could be \u201cgiven\neffect since it operates without reference to the existence of a separate\nsegregated fund.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The unions\ndo not dispute that the ban on political payroll deductions is severable\nfrom the other challenged provisions.

POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nban was valid at the state level because \u201cthe State is\nincurring costs to set up and maintain the [payroll deduc\ntion] program.\u201d Ibid. The court struck down the VCA,\nhowever, \u201cto the extent that it applies to local govern\nments and private employers,\u201d because the State had\nfailed to identify any subsidy it provided to such employ\ners to administer payroll deductions. Id., at *2 (footnote\nomitted), *6.\n   The state defendants appealed, contending that the ban\non political payroll deductions may be constitutionally\napplied to local government employees. Pocatello Ed.\nAssn. v. Heideman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007).\nNeither party challenged the District Court\u2019s rulings as to\nprivate and state-level employees, and therefore the only\nissue remaining concerned application of the ban to local\ngovernment employees.\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\nthat there was \u201cno subsidy by the State of Idaho for the\npayroll deduction systems of local governments.\u201d Id., at\n1059. The appellate court remarked that \u201cthe generalized\nlawmaking power held by the legislature with respect to a\nstate\u2019s political subdivisions does not establish that the\nstate is acting as a proprietor\u201d with respect to local gov\nernment employers. Id., at 1064. The court instead re\ngarded the relationship between the State and its political\nsubdivisions as analogous to that between the State and a\nregulated private utility. See id., at 1063\u20131065 (citing\nConsolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of\nN. Y., 447 U. S. 530 (1980)). While \u201cIdaho has the ulti\nmate power of control over the units of government at\nissue,\u201d it did not \u201cactually operat[e] or contro[l] the payroll\ndeduction systems of local units of government.\u201d 504\nF. 3d, at 1068. The court therefore applied strict scrutiny\nto Idaho\u2019s decision to prevent local government employers\nfrom allowing payroll deductions for political purposes,\nand held the statute unconstitutional as applied at the\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

S. __ (2008), and now\nreverse.\n                              II\n    Restrictions on speech based on its content are \u201cpre\nsumptively invalid\u201d and subject to strict scrutiny. Daven\nport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, 188 (2007);\nR. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 382 (1992). The unions\nassert that the ban on checkoffs for political activities falls\ninto this category because the law singles out political\nspeech for disfavored treatment.\n    The First Amendment, however, protects the right to be\nfree from government abridgment of speech. While in\nsome contexts the government must accommodate expres\nsion, it is not required to assist others in funding the\nexpression of particular ideas, including political ones.\n\u201c[A] legislature\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a\nfundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is\nnot subject to strict scrutiny.\u201d Regan v. Taxation With\nRepresentation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549 (1983); cf.\nSmith v. Highway Employees, 441 U. S. 463, 465 (1979)\n(per curiam) (\u201cFirst Amendment does not impose any\naffirmative obligation on the government to listen, to\nrespond or, in this context, to recognize [a labor] associa\ntion and bargain with it\u201d).\n    The court below concluded, and Idaho does not dispute,\nthat \u201cunions face substantial difficulties in collecting\nfunds for political speech without using payroll deduc\ntions.\u201d 504 F. 3d, at 1058. But the parties agree that the\nState is not constitutionally obligated to provide payroll\ndeductions at all. See Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Memorandum 10;\nsee also Toledo Area AFL\u2013CIO Council v. Pizza, 154 F. 3d\n307, 319\u2013320 (CA6 1998); cf. Charlotte v. Firefighters, 426\nU. S. 283, 286 (1976) (\u201cCourt would reject . . . contention\n. . . that respondents\u2019 status as union members or their\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED.

And the State\u2019s deci\nsion not to do so is not an abridgment of the unions\u2019\nspeech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see\nfit. They simply are barred from enlisting the State in\nsupport of that endeavor. Idaho\u2019s decision to limit public\nemployer payroll deductions as it has \u201cis not subject to\nstrict scrutiny\u201d under the First Amendment. Regan, 461\nU. S., at 549.\n   Given that the State has not infringed the unions\u2019 First\nAmendment rights, the State need only demonstrate a\nrational basis to justify the ban on political payroll deduc\ntions. Id., at 546\u2013551. The prohibition is not \u201caim[ed] at\nthe suppression of dangerous ideas,\u201d id., at 548 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), but is instead justified by the\nState\u2019s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics. We have previously recognized such a purpose in\nupholding limitations on public employee political activi\nties. See Civil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413\nU. S. 548, 565 (1973) (public perception of partiality can\nundermine confidence in representative government);\nPublic Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.

Idaho\u2019s decision to allow\npayroll deductions for some purposes but not for political\nactivities is plainly reasonable.2\n   Davenport guides our resolution here. That case also\ninvolved a distinction based on the content of speech:\nSpecific consent was required from nonunion members\nbefore agency fees charged to them could be used for elec\ntion-related activities, but consent was not required with\nrespect to agency fees used for other purposes. 551 U. S.,\nat 181\u2013182. We rejected the unions\u2019 argument that this\nrequirement violated the First Amendment because it\nturned on the content of the speech at issue. Id., at 188\u2013\n190. We recognized that the statute, rather than sup\npressing union speech, simply declined to assist that\nspeech by granting the unions the right to charge agency\nfees for election activities. That decision was reasonable\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE BREYER finds this analysis inapplicable because the chal\n\nlenged provision removes politically related deductions from an existing\nsystem. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut available deductions do not have tenure; a legislature is free to\naddress concerns as they arise.\n  JUSTICE BREYER would also subject the ban to more exacting scrutiny\nby analogizing it to various direct restrictions on expression. See post,\nat 2\u20134. That analogy misses the mark. A decision not to assist fund\nraising that may, as a practical matter, result in fewer contributions is\nsimply not the same as directly limiting expression. Cf. Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983)\n(\u201cAlthough [a union] does not have as much money as it wants, and\nthus cannot exercise its freedom of speech as much as it would like, the\nConstitution does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be\nnecessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). We therefore would not subject Idaho\u2019s\nstatute to the \u201copen-ended rough-and-tumble of factors\u201d proposed by\nthe dissent as an alternative to rational basis review. Jerome B.\nGrubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547\n(1995); see post, at 4.\n8                YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngiven the State\u2019s interest in preserving the integrity of the\nelection process. Ibid. We also concluded that the State\ndid \u201cnot have to enact an across-the-board limitation . . . to\nvindicate [its] more narrow concern.\u201d Id., at 189.\n   Here the restriction is on the use of a checkoff to fund\npolitical activities, but the same analysis governs. Idaho\ndoes not suppress political speech but simply declines to\npromote it through public employer checkoffs for political\nactivities. The concern that political payroll deductions\nmight be seen as involving public employers in politics\narises only because Idaho permits public employer payroll\ndeductions in the first place. As in Davenport, the State\u2019s\nresponse to that problem is limited to its source\u2014in this\ncase, political payroll deductions. The ban on such deduc\ntions plainly serves the State\u2019s interest in separating\npublic employment from political activities.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE BREYER suggests that the ban on political payroll deduc\n\ntions may not be applied evenhandedly to all politically related deduc\ntions. Post, at 4\u20136 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nJUSTICE STEVENS goes further and would find the ban unconstitutional\nin all its applications as discriminatory. Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion).\nThe District Court, however, noted that the ban \u201cis not viewpoint\nbased,\u201d 2005 WL 3241745, *3; the unions acknowledged in their Court\nof Appeals brief that they \u201chave not attempted to establish that Section\n44\u20132004(2) is based on viewpoint discrimination,\u201d Brief for Plaintiffs-\nAppellees in No. 06\u201335004 (CA9), p. 18, n. 13; and nothing in the\nQuestions Presented before this Court raised any issue of viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n   The ban on political payroll deductions is by its terms not limited to\nany particular type of political contribution. Nothing in the record\nsuggests that public employers permit deductions for some political\nactivities but not for those of unions. Idaho\u2019s attorney general\u2014\ncharged with enforcing the ban\u2014explicitly confirmed that it \u201capplies to\nall organizations, to any deduction regarding political issues, applies\nregardless of viewpoint or message, applies to all employers, and it does\nnot single out any candidates or issues.\u201d App. 110. If the ban is not\nenforced evenhandedly, plaintiffs are free to bring an as applied chal\nlenge. See National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 587\n(1998).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

The unions abandoned their challenge to the\nrestriction at the state level, but contend that strict scru\ntiny is still warranted when the ban is applied to local\ngovernment employers. In that context, the unions argue,\nthe State is no longer declining to facilitate speech\nthrough its own payroll system, but is obstructing speech\nin the local governments\u2019 payroll systems. See Brief for\nRespondents 44\u201346. We find that distinction unpersua\nsive, and hold that the same deferential review applies\nwhether the prohibition on payroll deductions for political\nspeech is directed at state or local governmental entities.\n  \u201cPolitical subdivisions of States\u2014counties, cities, or\nwhatever\u2014never were and never have been considered as\nsovereign entities.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575\n(1964).    They are instead \u201csubordinate governmental\ninstrumentalities created by the State to assist in the\ncarrying out of state governmental functions.\u201d Ibid.; see\nalso Louisiana ex rel. Folsom v. Mayor and Administrators\nof New Orleans, 109 U. S. 285, 287 (1883) (\u201cMunicipal\ncorporations are instrumentalities of the State for the\nconvenient administration of government within their\nlimits\u201d). State political subdivisions are \u201cmerely . . . de\npartment[s] of the State, and the State may withhold,\ngrant or withdraw powers and privileges as it sees fit.\u201d\nTrenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182, 187 (1923). Here the\nIdaho Legislature has elected to withhold from all public\nemployers the power to provide payroll deductions for\npolitical activities.\n  The State\u2019s legislative action is of course subject to First\nAmendment and other constitutional scrutiny whether\nthat action is applicable at the state level, the local level,\nboth, or some subpart of either. But we are aware of no\ncase suggesting that a different analysis applies under the\nFirst Amendment depending on the level of government\n10            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naffected, and the unions have cited none. The ban on\npolitical payroll deductions furthers Idaho\u2019s interest in\nseparating the operation of government from partisan\npolitics. That interest extends to all public employers at\nwhatever level of government.\n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court of Ap\npeals invoked our decision in Consolidated Edison Co. of\nN. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530. In\nthat case, we held that a state commission could not,\nconsistent with the First Amendment, prohibit a privately\nowned electric utility from discussing controversial issues\nin its bill inserts. Id., at 544. We ruled that the fact that\nthe State regulated the utility did not authorize the prohi\nbition. Id., at 540. The Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe same analysis applied here, and that \u201cthe State\u2019s\nbroad powers of control over local government entities are\nsolely those of a regulator, analogous to the [state commis\nsion\u2019s] regulatory power over [the private utility].\u201d 504\nF. 3d, at 1065.\n  That analogy is misguided. A private corporation is\nsubject to the government\u2019s legal authority to regulate its\nconduct. A political subdivision, on the other hand, is a\nsubordinate unit of government created by the State to\ncarry out delegated governmental functions. A private\ncorporation enjoys constitutional protections, see First\nNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 778, n. 14\n(1978), but a political subdivision, \u201ccreated by the state for\nthe better ordering of government, has no privileges or\nimmunities under the federal constitution which it may\ninvoke in opposition to the will of its creator.\u201d Williams v.\nMayor of Baltimore, 289 U. S. 36, 40 (1933); see Trenton v.\nNew Jersey, supra, at 185 (municipality, as successor to a\nprivate water company, does not enjoy against the State\nthe same constitutional rights as the water company:\n\u201c[T]he relations existing between the State and the water\ncompany were not the same as those between the State\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Given the\nrelationship between the State and its political subdivi\nsions, however, it is immaterial how the State allocates\nfunding or management responsibilities between the\ndifferent levels of government. The question is whether\nthe State must affirmatively assist political speech by\nallowing public employers to administer payroll deduc\ntions for political activities.

The parties agree\nhere, as they did in the Court of Appeals, that Idaho\u2019s ban\non payroll deductions for political activities violates First\nAmendment limitations as applied to the private sector.\nThey also agree here, as they did before the Ninth Circuit,\nthat the ban is permissible as applied to state-level gov\nernment entities. See ante, at 4, 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4. The\nsole question posed for this Court\u2019s decision is the appro\npriate placement of the State\u2019s political subdivisions: For\nthe purpose at hand, should the Court align local\ngovernment employment with private-sector employment\nor with state-level employment?\n  \u201cGiven the relationship between the State and its politi\ncal subdivisions,\u201d the Court persuasively explains, \u201cit is\nimmaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment.\u201d Ante, at 11.

See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575 (1964).\nHence the fact that a state statute, rather than a munici\npal ordinance, limits the use of the municipality\u2019s payroll\ndeduction system is beside the point. I agree that this is\nso, and I agree with JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s discussion about\nthe relationship between the state and the municipality.\n  I do not agree, however, with the Court\u2019s further analy\nsis of the pertinent legal question\u2014whether the state\nstatute violates the First Amendment. Nor do I agree\nwith its ultimate conclusion. Rather, in my view, we\nshould remand this case for further consideration.\n    The Court\u2019s First Amendment analysis emphasizes its\ncharacterization of the statute as not \u201cabridging\u201d a union\u2019s\nor a worker\u2019s \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d but rather \u201cdeclin[ing]\nto promote\u201d that speech. Ante, at 1 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I agree that the First Amendment does\nnot prohibit government from \u201cdeclining to promote\u201d\nspeech. It says that government shall not \u201cabridg[e] the\nfreedom of speech.\u201d (Emphasis added) . But I do not think\nthe distinction particularly useful in this case.\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    That is because here the distinction is neither easy to\ndraw nor likely to prove determinative. Sometimes, I\nconcede, the distinction may help. Were there no payroll\ndeduction system at all and were the unions arguing for\nthe creation of such a system from scratch, one might\ncharacterize their claim as seeking the promotion of\nspeech. But that is not the situation here. A deduction\nsystem already exists. The unions attack a separate\nstatutory provision that removes politically related deduc\ntions from that system. And linguistically speaking, one\nneed not characterize such an attack as (1) seeking speech\npromotion rather than (2) seeking to prevent an abridg\nment of political-speech-related activity that otherwise\n(i.e., in the absence of the exception) would occur. In such\nan instance, the debate over characterization is more\nmetaphysical than practical.\n     More importantly, the characterization quite possibly\ndoes not matter.        Suppose, for example, a somewhat\nsimilar statutory exception picks and chooses among\npolitical causes, prohibiting deductions that help one\npolitical party while permitting deductions that help\nanother. The First Amendment result could not turn upon\nwhether one described the exception as an \u201cabridgment\u201d or\na \u201cpromotion\u201d failure. And, as I shall explain, infra, at 5\u2013\n6, such may be the case here.\n     I disagree with the Court\u2019s characterizations in an\nother respect. The Court says that because the exception\n\u201chas not infringed the unions\u2019 First Amendment rights,\u201d\n\u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d does not apply and, thus, the State \u201cneed\nonly demonstrate a rational basis\u201d\u2014the standard of re\nview applicable to any ordinary legislation that does not\ninfringe fundamental rights\u2014\u201cto justify the ban on politi\ncal payroll deductions.\u201d Ante, at 6 (emphasis added). I\nagree that the exception does not call for \u201cstrict scru\ntiny\u201d\u2014a categorization that almost always proves fatal to\nthe law in question. After all, the exception does not\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nrestrict the content of the unions\u2019 speech, impose a prior\nrestraint on that speech, or ban union speech on political\nissues altogether.\n     But I disagree with the Court in that I believe there is\na First Amendment interest at stake. The exception\naffects speech, albeit indirectly, by restricting a channel\nthrough which speech-supporting finance might flow. As a\nresult, the alternative to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d is not necessarily\na form of \u201crational basis\u201d review\u2014a test that almost every\nrestriction will pass. And instead of applying either \u201cstrict\nscrutiny\u201d or \u201crational basis\u201d review to the statutory excep\ntion, I would ask the question that this Court has asked in\nother speech-related contexts, namely whether the statute\nimposes a burden upon speech that is disproportionate in\nlight of the other interests the government seeks to\nachieve. See Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 433\u2013434\n(1992) (election regulation); Nixon v. Shrink Missouri\nGovernment PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 403 (2000) (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring) (collecting cases); see also, e.g., Thompson v.\nWestern States Medical Center, 535 U.S. 357, 388 (2002)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting) (discussing the Court\u2019s applica\ntion of this approach in the commercial speech context);\nDenver Area Ed.

Board of Ed.\nof Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S.\n563, 568 (1968) (government employee speech). Constitu\ntional courts in other nations also have used similar ap\nproaches when facing somewhat similar problems. See,\ne.g., Libman v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S. C.\nR. 569 (Canada) (applying proportionality in the campaign\nfinance context); Bowman v. United Kingdom, 26 Euro\npean Ct. of Human Rights 1 (1998) (same); Midi Television\n(Pty) Ltd v. Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] SCA 56\n(RSA) (South Africa) (applying proportionality in the\nfreedom of press context); Bakri v. Israel Film Council,\n4             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nHCJ 316/303 (Israel 2003) (applying proportionality in the\nfreedom of expression context).\n   In these cases the Court has sought to determine\nwhether the harm to speech-related interests is dispropor\ntionate in light of the degree of harm, justifications, and\npotential alternatives. In doing so, it has considered the\nseriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will\nlikely cause, the importance of the provision\u2019s countervail\ning objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to\nachieve those objectives, and whether there are other less\nrestrictive ways of doing so. In light of these considera\ntions, it has determined whether ultimately the statute\nworks speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its\njustifications. See Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.\nv. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (describing need for a \u201cfit\u201d\nbetween legislative ends and means \u201cwhose scope is \u2018in\nproportion to the interest served\u2019 \u201d); United States v.\nAmerican Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 217\u2013218\n(2003) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\n    Where context calls for \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d one would not\nnecessarily ask these proportionality questions; but I\nwould ask them in other contexts calling for less than\nordinary legislative leeway in light of the fact that consti\ntutionally protected expression is at issue. See id., at 218.\nTo do so, in my view, helps structure what the Court\nsometimes calls an \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d inquiry. See\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622\n(1994).\n   Applying this analysis here, I would find the statutory\nexception constitutional, but only if I were convinced that\nthe exception applied even handedly among similar politi\ncally related contributions. If so, the provision would still\nnegatively affect speech-related interests, for it would\nclose off one channel through which individuals might\nprovide speech-enabling funds to political institutions.\nBut, as the majority points out, many other channels for\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthose funds exist, and the State has a strong interest in\n\u201cavoiding the reality or appearance of government favorit\nism or entanglement with partisan politics,\u201d ante, at 6. I\nwould consequently find the restriction justified as propor\ntionately serving a legitimate, important governmental\nneed. Cf. Fox, supra, at 480.\n    It is not clear, however, whether the particular excep\ntion before us does, in fact, operate even handedly. To\nread the statute without more, I concede, suggests even\nhandedness. The provision says that \u201c[d]eductions for\npolitical activities as defined in chapter 26, title 44, Idaho\nCode, shall not be deducted from wages, earnings or com\npensation of an employee.\u201d Idaho Code Ann. \u00a744\u20132004(2)\n(Michie 2003) (emphasis added). And chapter 26, title 44,\nIdaho Code, defines \u201cpolitical activities\u201d without special\nreference to labor organizations. See \u00a744\u20132602(e).\n   Nonetheless, certain features of the provision suggest it\nmay affect some politically-related deductions, namely\nlabor-related deductions, but not others. Title 44 of the\nIdaho Code\u2014entitled \u201cLabor\u201d\u2014is about labor activities.\nAnd the ban on payroll deductions for political activities\nwas enacted as part of a statute in which every other pro\nvision is concerned solely with union activities. See Vol\nuntary Contributions Act, 2003 Idaho Sess. Laws chs. 97\nand 340 (codified at Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a744\u20132601 through\n44\u20132605 and \u00a744\u20132004). At the same time, the provision\ncontaining the payroll deduction ban is immediately fol\nlowed by another related provision that expressly men\ntions labor unions. See \u00a744\u20132004(3) (\u201cNothing in this\nchapter shall prohibit an employee from personally paying\ncontributions for political activities . . . to a labor organiza\ntion unless such payment is prohibited by law\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   It is important to know whether the exception concerns\nonly labor-related political deductions (while allowing\nother similar deductions) or treats all alike. A restriction\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat applies to the political activities of unions alone\nwould seem unlikely to further the government\u2019s justifying\nobjective, namely providing the appearance of political\nneutrality. And in that case, the provision could well\nbring about speech-related harm that is disproportionate\nto the statute\u2019s tendency to further the government\u2019s\n\u201cneutrality\u201d objective.\n   Because the Court of Appeals analyzed the issue as if\nthe State \u201cregulated\u201d its municipalities (as government\nmight regulate a private firm), it did not resolve the ques\ntions I have just described. I would remand the case so\nthat it can decide whether the parties appropriately raised\nthose matters and, if so, consider them. Accordingly, I\nwould vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision and remand\nthe case.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

Because it is clear to me that the\nrestriction was intended to make it more difficult for\nunions to finance political speech, I would hold it unconsti\ntutional in all its applications.\n                             I\n  \u201cIt is axiomatic that the government may not regulate\nspeech based on its substantive content or the message it\nconveys.\u201d Rosenberger v.

On its face, \u00a744\u20132004(2)\nrestricts payroll deductions for all political activities, and\npetitioners contend that the State reasonably enacted\n\u00a744\u20132004(2) \u201cto avoid either the appearance or the reality\nof public employer involvement in . . . electoral politics.\u201d\nTr. of Oral Arg. 15. Several features of the statute, how\never, belie its purported viewpoint neutrality.\n   That the restriction was more narrowly intended to\ntarget union fundraising is first evidenced by its statutory\ncontext. The other provisions of the VCA with which \u00a744\u2013\n2004(2) was enacted pertain exclusively to unions.1 For\ninstance, \u00a744\u20132603 requires unions to create separate\nfunds for political activities and places restrictions on\nunions\u2019 solicitation of political contributions; \u00a744\u20132604\nmakes it a misdemeanor, among other things, for unions\nto make expenditures for political activities from union\ndues; and \u00a744\u20132605 establishes registration and reporting\nrequirements for union political funds. The provisions\nproximate to \u00a744\u20132004(2), which were enacted roughly two\ndecades earlier as part of the Right to Work Act, 1985\nSess. Laws ch. 2, \u00a71 (codified at Idaho Code \u00a744\u20132001 et\nseq.), are similarly directed at union activities. Even the\nsubsection immediately preceding \u00a744\u20132004(2) is aimed\nspecifically at unions: \u00a744\u20132004(1) prohibits payroll deduc\ntions for union dues, fees, assessments, or other charges\nwithout an employee\u2019s prior written authorization. And,\nfinally, \u00a744\u20132004(2) is codified in a title of the Idaho Code\nentitled \u201cLabor\u201d and in a chapter entitled \u201cRight to Work.\u201d\nTogether, these statutory features strongly suggest that\nthe Idaho Legislature enacted \u00a744\u20132004(2) specifically to\nimpede union fundraising.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Respondents also challenged these provisions of the VCA, and peti\n\ntioners conceded their invalidity earlier in this litigation, acknowledg\ning that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of\nlabor organizations to solicit political contributions. See Pocatello Ed.\nAssn. v. Heidman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Petitioners contend that the\nrestriction was enacted to further the State\u2019s interest in\navoiding the appearance or actuality of public employer\ninvolvement in partisan politics. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.\nBut, as enacted, \u00a744\u20132004(2) prohibited private as well as\npublic employers from making payroll deductions for\npolitical activities. As petitioners admitted at oral argu\nment, \u201cthe State has no interest in . . . private employers\u2019\ndetermination to be involved or not involved in political\nmatters.\u201d Id., at 6. That petitioners conceded the invalid\nity of \u00a744\u20132004(2) as applied to private employers earlier\nin this litigation does not require us to ignore the breadth\nof the statute the State enacted in assessing the provi\nsion\u2019s scope and purpose. Consideration of the provision\nactually passed by the legislature makes clear that the\nState\u2019s asserted interest in the restriction is not compati\nble with its breadth.\n   The State\u2019s interest in avoiding the appearance or real\nity of employer political involvement is also inconsistent\nwith its decision not to restrict deductions for charitable\nactivities. Such deductions will often present a similar\nrisk of creating an appearance of political involvement as\ndeductions for covered political activities. Yet the State\nhas made no effort to distinguish this type of political\nactivity. As with the State\u2019s decision to apply \u00a744\u20132004(2)\nto private employers, its failure to apply the restriction to\ncharitable deductions produces a significant mismatch\nbetween the restriction\u2019s reach and its asserted purpose.\n   To my mind, it is clear from these features of the legisla\ntion that \u00a744\u20132004(2)\u2019s prohibition on payroll deductions\nfor \u201cpolitical activities\u201d was intended to target union po\nlitical activity.

ASSN.\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n(noting that a rule restricting the use of state funds to\npromote or oppose unionization impermissibly expressed a\npro-union preference, thereby chilling one side of the\npublic debate).2 The majority\u2019s facile assertion that the\nFirst Amendment does not confer a right to government\nsubsidization of private speech cannot validate an evi\ndently discriminatory restriction on fundraising for politi\ncal speech.3\n                              II\n  Although the statute\u2019s discriminatory purpose provides\nan adequate ground for deciding this case, I briefly note\nmy disagreement with the majority\u2019s analysis of \u00a744\u2013\n2004(2)\u2019s constitutionality as applied to local government\nemployees. The Court of Appeals found this application of\nthe provision invalid due to the State\u2019s failure to show that\nit \u201cactually operates or controls the payroll deduction\nsystems of local units of government.\u201d Pocatello Ed. Assn.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 It\n       may even be true that \u00a744\u20132004(2) only affects union political\nactivity, as petitioners can point to no evidence that another entity is\naffected by the statute. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. But it is unnecessary to\ndetermine whether other entities are actually affected by the restriction\nin light of its clearly discriminatory purpose.\n   3 The discriminatory nature of \u00a744\u20132004(2) distinguishes it from the\n\nrestriction we upheld in Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S.\n177 (2007)\u2014a decision on which the majority heavily relies. In that\ncase, state law authorized public-sector unions to charge nonmembers\nan agency fee equivalent to membership dues and to have employers\ncollect that fee through payroll deductions. Respondent challenged the\nvalidity of a state ballot initiative requiring public-sector unions to\nobtain nonmembers\u2019 affirmative authorization before using their fees\nfor political purposes. We held that the affirmative-authorization\nprovision did not violate respondent\u2019s First Amendment rights because\nit merely placed a viewpoint-neutral limitation on an \u201cextraordinary\u201d\nstate-law entitlement allowing it to collect and spend the money of\ngovernment employees. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 9, 10). By contrast,\n\u00a744\u20132004(2) is not a limitation on a state-law entitlement that specifi\ncally benefits unions but rather a union-specific exclusion from a\ngenerally available benefit.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                 5\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nv. Heidman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1068 (CA9 2007).4 In the\nabsence of evidence of such control, the Court of Appeals\nheld, \u201cthe State has a relatively weak interest in prevent\ning [respondents] from exercising their First Amendment\nrights.\u201d Ibid.\n    Unlike the Court of Appeals, the majority omits any\nexamination of the relationship Idaho has established\nwith its political subdivisions. Rather, the majority finds\nit sufficient to assert that States, as the creators of local\ngovernment, retain the authority to grant or withdraw\nsubdivision powers and privileges. Ante, at 8. The fact of\nthat authority, however, hardly proves that the particular\nrelationship between a State and its political subdivisions\nis irrelevant to our constitutional inquiry. All States do\nnot treat their subdivisions the same, and those differ\nences are sometimes consequential.\n    We have in other contexts recognized the constitutional\nsignificance of the relationship a State chooses to establish\nwith its political subdivisions. For instance, in Mt.\nHealthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977),\nwe stated that the answer to the question whether a\nschool board should \u201cbe treated as an arm of the State\npartaking of the State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity\n. . . depends, at least in part, upon the nature of the entity\ncreated by state law.\u201d And in McMillian v. Monroe\nCounty, 520 U. S. 781, 786 (1997), we held that whether a\nsheriff has county or state policymaking authority for\npurposes of determining liability under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 is ascertained by reference to \u201cthe actual\nfunction of a government official,\u201d which is in turn \u201cde\npendent on the definition of the official\u2019s functions under\nrelevant state law.\u201d In both cases, the constitutional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The State conceded at oral argument before the Court of Appeals\n\nthat it is not the proprietor of local government workplaces or their\npayroll deduction programs. See 504 F. 3d, at 1065.\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nanalysis turned in part on the way the State had struc\ntured its relationship with its political subdivisions.\n   Although we have not previously considered the impli\ncations of the state-subdivision relationship in the First\nAmendment context, we have repeatedly recognized the\nsignificance of an analogous inquiry: whether the govern\nment, in imposing speech restrictions, is acting in its\ncapacity as regulator or proprietor. See, e.g., Davenport v.\nWashington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, at ___ (2007) (slip\nop., at 9\u201310); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.\nFund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 805\u2013806 (1985). Accordingly, I\ncannot agree with the majority\u2019s assertion that, because\npolitical subdivisions are instrumentalities of the State, \u201cit\nis immaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment,\u201d ante, at 11. Relationships between state and\nlocal governments are more varied, and the consequences\nof that variation are more significant, than the majority\u2019s\nanalysis admits.\n   Because my conclusion that \u00a744\u20132004(2) discriminates\nagainst labor organizations is sufficient to decide this case,\nI find it unnecessary to fully consider the implications of\nIdaho\u2019s relationship with its political subdivisions.\nRather, I note the significance of this relationship to urge\nits careful consideration in future cases.\n                               III\n  The majority avoids acknowledging \u00a744\u20132004(2)\u2019s evi\ndently discriminatory purpose only by examining the\nstatute out of context and ignoring its initial applicability\nto private employers. Considering the provision as en\nacted, I cannot find it justified as the majority does by \u201cthe\nState\u2019s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics,\u201d ante, at 6.

So far as\nIdaho\u2019s law affects freedom of expression, I am not per\nsuaded there is sufficient reason to treat the State\u2019s statu\ntory prohibition differently depending on the unit of its\ngovernment employing the worker whose salary deduction\nwould fund political activity. There is no question in this\ncase that the lower echelons of Idaho government are\ncreatures of the State exercising state power in discharg\ning what are ultimately state responsibilities. Nor is there\nany apparent reason to think the State\u2019s asserted legiti\nmate interest differs according to the level of government\ndoing the State\u2019s work, whether that interest is having a\nfirewall between public administration and politics or\nsimply exercising a power to decide whether public em\nployees who administer payrolls should spend work time\nadvancing private political speech.\n   But I find it impossible to stop there. Although this case\ncomes to us as one about the scope of the public business\nthe State is free, within reasonable limits, to manage as it\nthinks wise, the specter of another First Amendment\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncategory, one of superior significance, is too insistent to\nignore. It is true that government may choose to manage\nits own affairs in ways that draw reasonable subject\nmatter lines affecting speech, being free, for example, to\nsell space on its buses for advertising soap but not politi\ncians. See Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298\n(1974). But a government is not free to draw those lines\nas a way to discourage or suppress the expression of view\npoints it disagrees with, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal De\nfense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806, 811\u2013812,\n(1985); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn.,\n460 U. S. 37, 46, 49 (1983); only narrow tailoring to serve\na compelling state interest could justify that kind of selec\ntivity, see United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group,\nInc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000).\n   This difference between viewpoint discrimination and\nneutral regulation of governmental activity is on point in\nthis case. For although the State invokes its legitimate\ninterest in keeping public administration free from politi\ncal involvement as its reason for Idaho Code \u00a744\u20132004(2)\n(Michie 2003), this ostensibly viewpoint-neutral rationale\nsuffers from the circumstances JUSTICE STEVENS describes\nin detail, see ante, at 2\u20134 (dissenting opinion). Every\nother provision of the amendatory act in which \u00a744\u2013\n2004(2) was included deals with unions, the statute\namended regulates unions, and all this legislation is\nplaced in the State\u2019s labor law codification. Ante., at 2.\nUnion speech, and nothing else, seems to have been on the\nlegislative mind.\n   The Court\u2019s answer to this recalls Davenport v. Wash\nington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177 (2007), in suggesting that\nIdaho was merely limiting a self-created risk of entangling\npublic administration with politics, which followed from\nauthorizing public payroll deductions for union benefit in\nthe first place, ante, at 7\u20138. But the scope of the state\nenactment that imposes the prohibition places that expla\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nnation in question, for the statute goes beyond constrain\ning the government as employer, and criminalizes deduc\ntions for political purposes even when administered by\nprivate employers, an application of the law the State\nconcedes is unconstitutional. Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Hei\ndeman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007). Hence a reader\nof the statute may fairly suspect that Idaho\u2019s legislative\nobject was not efficient, clean government, but that un\nions\u2019 political viewpoints were its target, selected out of all\nthe politics the State might filter from its public work\nplaces.\n   What to do about this reasonable suspicion of viewpoint\ndiscrimination is a dilemma. We can hardly disregard it,\nfor it affects the weight this case can carry as precedent; a\ndecision that ignores the elephant in the room is a decision\nwith diminished authority. But the potential issue of\nviewpoint discrimination that should be addressed in this\ncase is not before us. Although the unions\u2019 brief alludes to\nviewpoint discrimination in several places, that is not the\nfocus of their argument. The unions, instead, aim at\nshowing that the State is acting as a regulator of local\ngovernments (much as it regulates private corporations),\nnot as a manager setting limits to what government will\ndo with public resources; consequently they rest their\nposition on the argument that any state discrimination\nagainst political speech is illegitimate, however consis\ntently all shades of political speech may be treated. And\neven if we could properly recast the case by remanding to\nconsider viewpoint discrimination, see Cornelius, supra, at\n811\u2013812, a remand could only affect the application of the\nstatute to subordinate units of government; the unions\nhave accepted the constitutionality of applying the law to\nthe State, where an effort at viewpoint discrimination\nwould be as unconstitutional as it would be at the level of\na town.\n   The upshot is that if we decide the case as it comes to us\n4            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nwe will shut our eyes to a substantial, if not the substan\ntial, issue raised by the facts. But if we were to expand\nthe issues presented to us by remanding for enquiry into\nviewpoint discrimination, we would risk having to wink\nlater at an unconstitutional application of the law to the\nState, owing to the unions\u2019 decision not to challenge that\napplication either in the Ninth Circuit or before us. This\nis a good description of a case that should not be in this\nCourt as a vehicle to refine First Amendment doctrine.\n   I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted, and I respectfully dissent.\n",

Respondents\u2014a group of Idaho public\n  employee unions\u2014sued, alleging that the ban on payroll deductions\n  for political activities violated the First and Fourteenth Amend\n  ments. The District Court upheld the ban at the state level, but\n  struck it down as it applies to local governments. In affirming, the\n  Ninth Circuit stated that, while Idaho has the ultimate control over\n  local governmental units, it did not actually operate or control their\n  payroll deduction systems. The court applied strict scrutiny to hold\n  that the statute was unconstitutional as applied at the local level.\nHeld: Idaho\u2019s ban on political payroll deductions, as applied to local\n governmental units, does not infringe the unions\u2019 First Amendment\n rights.

The First Amendment does not, however,\n impose an obligation on government to subsidize speech. See Regan\n v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 549. Idaho\u2019s\n law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote\n that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activi\n ties. Idaho\u2019s public employee unions are free to engage in such\n speech as they see fit. They simply are barred from enlisting the\n State in support of that endeavor. Idaho\u2019s decision to limit public\n employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions\u2019\n First Amendment rights. The State accordingly need only demon\n strate a rational basis to justify the ban. Idaho\u2019s justification is the\n2                  YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED.

Political subdivisions have never been considered\n    sovereign entities but are instead \u201csubordinate governmental in\n    strumentalities.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575. The State\u2019s\n    legislative action is subject to First Amendment scrutiny whether it\n    is applicable at the state level, the local level, both, or some subpart\n    of either, but no case suggests that a different analysis applies de\n    pending on the level of government affected.

He may not, however,\nchoose to have an amount deducted and remitted to the\nunion\u2019s political action committee, because Idaho law\nprohibits payroll deductions for political activities. A\ngroup of unions representing Idaho public employees\nchallenged this limitation. They conceded that the limita\ntion was valid as applied at the state level, but argued\nthat it violated their First Amendment rights when ap\nplied to county, municipal, school district, and other local\npublic employers.\n   We do not agree. The First Amendment prohibits gov\nernment from \u201cabridging the freedom of speech\u201d; it does\nnot confer an affirmative right to use government payroll\nmechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expres\nsion. Idaho\u2019s law does not restrict political speech, but\nrather declines to promote that speech by allowing public\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED.

Such a decision\nis reasonable in light of the State\u2019s interest in avoiding the\nappearance that carrying out the public\u2019s business is\ntainted by partisan political activity. That interest ex\ntends to government at the local as well as state level, and\nnothing in the First Amendment prevents a State from\ndetermining that its political subdivisions may not provide\npayroll deductions for political activities.\n                                I\n   Idaho\u2019s Right to Work Act declares that the \u201cright to\nwork shall not be infringed or restricted in any way based\non membership in, affiliation with, or financial support of\na labor organization or on refusal to join, affiliate with, or\nfinancially or otherwise support a labor organization.\u201d\n1985 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 2, \u00a71 (codified at Idaho Code\n\u00a744\u20132001 (Michie 2003)). As part of that policy, the Act\nprohibits any requirement for the payment of dues or fees\nto a labor organization as a condition of employment, \u00a744\u2013\n2003, but authorizes employers to deduct union fees from\nan employee\u2019s wages with the employee\u2019s \u201csigned written\nauthorization,\u201d \u00a744\u20132004(1).

That\nlegislation, among other things, amended the Right to\nWork Act by adding a prohibition on payroll deductions for\npolitical purposes.

The court struck down the VCA,\nhowever, \u201cto the extent that it applies to local govern\nments and private employers,\u201d because the State had\nfailed to identify any subsidy it provided to such employ\ners to administer payroll deductions.

The appellate court remarked that \u201cthe generalized\nlawmaking power held by the legislature with respect to a\nstate\u2019s political subdivisions does not establish that the\nstate is acting as a proprietor\u201d with respect to local gov\nernment employers. Id., at 1064. The court instead re\ngarded the relationship between the State and its political\nsubdivisions as analogous to that between the State and a\nregulated private utility. See id., at 1063\u20131065 (citing\nConsolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of\nN. Y., 447 U. S. 530 (1980)).

The unions\nassert that the ban on checkoffs for political activities falls\ninto this category because the law singles out political\nspeech for disfavored treatment.\n    The First Amendment, however, protects the right to be\nfree from government abridgment of speech. While in\nsome contexts the government must accommodate expres\nsion, it is not required to assist others in funding the\nexpression of particular ideas, including political ones.\n\u201c[A] legislature\u2019s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a\nfundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is\nnot subject to strict scrutiny.\u201d Regan v.

But the parties agree that the\nState is not constitutionally obligated to provide payroll\ndeductions at all. See Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Memorandum 10;\nsee also Toledo Area AFL\u2013CIO Council v. Pizza, 154 F. 3d\n307, 319\u2013320 (CA6 1998); cf. Charlotte v. Firefighters, 426\nU.

And the State\u2019s deci\nsion not to do so is not an abridgment of the unions\u2019\nspeech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see\nfit. They simply are barred from enlisting the State in\nsupport of that endeavor. Idaho\u2019s decision to limit public\nemployer payroll deductions as it has \u201cis not subject to\nstrict scrutiny\u201d under the First Amendment. Regan, 461\nU. S., at 549.\n   Given that the State has not infringed the unions\u2019 First\nAmendment rights, the State need only demonstrate a\nrational basis to justify the ban on political payroll deduc\ntions. Id., at 546\u2013551. The prohibition is not \u201caim[ed] at\nthe suppression of dangerous ideas,\u201d id., at 548 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), but is instead justified by the\nState\u2019s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics. We have previously recognized such a purpose in\nupholding limitations on public employee political activi\nties. See Civil Service Comm\u2019n v. Letter Carriers, 413\nU.

Idaho\u2019s decision to allow\npayroll deductions for some purposes but not for political\nactivities is plainly reasonable.2\n   Davenport guides our resolution here. That case also\ninvolved a distinction based on the content of speech:\nSpecific consent was required from nonunion members\nbefore agency fees charged to them could be used for elec\ntion-related activities, but consent was not required with\nrespect to agency fees used for other purposes. 551 U. S.,\nat 181\u2013182. We rejected the unions\u2019 argument that this\nrequirement violated the First Amendment because it\nturned on the content of the speech at issue. Id., at 188\u2013\n190. We recognized that the statute, rather than sup\npressing union speech, simply declined to assist that\nspeech by granting the unions the right to charge agency\nfees for election activities. That decision was reasonable\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 JUSTICE BREYER finds this analysis inapplicable because the chal\n\nlenged provision removes politically related deductions from an existing\nsystem. Post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nBut available deductions do not have tenure; a legislature is free to\naddress concerns as they arise.\n  JUSTICE BREYER would also subject the ban to more exacting scrutiny\nby analogizing it to various direct restrictions on expression. See post,\nat 2\u20134. That analogy misses the mark. A decision not to assist fund\nraising that may, as a practical matter, result in fewer contributions is\nsimply not the same as directly limiting expression. Cf. Regan v.\nTaxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983)\n(\u201cAlthough [a union] does not have as much money as it wants, and\nthus cannot exercise its freedom of speech as much as it would like, the\nConstitution does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be\nnecessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). We therefore would not subject Idaho\u2019s\nstatute to the \u201copen-ended rough-and-tumble of factors\u201d proposed by\nthe dissent as an alternative to rational basis review. Jerome B.\nGrubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 547\n(1995); see post, at 4.\n8                YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED.

We also concluded that the State\ndid \u201cnot have to enact an across-the-board limitation . . . to\nvindicate [its] more narrow concern.\u201d Id., at 189.\n   Here the restriction is on the use of a checkoff to fund\npolitical activities, but the same analysis governs. Idaho\ndoes not suppress political speech but simply declines to\npromote it through public employer checkoffs for political\nactivities. The concern that political payroll deductions\nmight be seen as involving public employers in politics\narises only because Idaho permits public employer payroll\ndeductions in the first place. As in Davenport, the State\u2019s\nresponse to that problem is limited to its source\u2014in this\ncase, political payroll deductions. The ban on such deduc\ntions plainly serves the State\u2019s interest in separating\npublic employment from political activities.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 JUSTICE BREYER suggests that the ban on political payroll deduc\n\ntions may not be applied evenhandedly to all politically related deduc\ntions. Post, at 4\u20136 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nJUSTICE STEVENS goes further and would find the ban unconstitutional\nin all its applications as discriminatory. Post, at 1 (dissenting opinion).\nThe District Court, however, noted that the ban \u201cis not viewpoint\nbased,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3241745</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3; the unions acknowledged in their Court\nof Appeals brief that they \u201chave not attempted to establish that Section\n44\u20132004(2) is based on viewpoint discrimination,\u201d Brief for Plaintiffs-\nAppellees in No. 06\u201335004 (CA9), p. 18, n. 13; and nothing in the\nQuestions Presented before this Court raised any issue of viewpoint\ndiscrimination.\n   The ban on political payroll deductions is by its terms not limited to\nany particular type of political contribution. Nothing in the record\nsuggests that public employers permit deductions for some political\nactivities but not for those of unions. Idaho\u2019s attorney general\u2014\ncharged with enforcing the ban\u2014explicitly confirmed that it \u201capplies to\nall organizations, to any deduction regarding political issues, applies\nregardless of viewpoint or message, applies to all employers, and it does\nnot single out any candidates or issues.\u201d App. 110. If the ban is not\nenforced evenhandedly, plaintiffs are free to bring an as applied chal\nlenge. See National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U.

The unions abandoned their challenge to the\nrestriction at the state level, but contend that strict scru\ntiny is still warranted when the ban is applied to local\ngovernment employers. In that context, the unions argue,\nthe State is no longer declining to facilitate speech\nthrough its own payroll system, but is obstructing speech\nin the local governments\u2019 payroll systems. See Brief for\nRespondents 44\u201346. We find that distinction unpersua\nsive, and hold that the same deferential review applies\nwhether the prohibition on payroll deductions for political\nspeech is directed at state or local governmental entities.\n  \u201cPolitical subdivisions of States\u2014counties, cities, or\nwhatever\u2014never were and never have been considered as\nsovereign entities.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575\n(1964).    They are instead \u201csubordinate governmental\ninstrumentalities created by the State to assist in the\ncarrying out of state governmental functions.\u201d Ibid.; see\nalso Louisiana ex rel. Folsom v. Mayor and Administrators\nof New Orleans, 109 U. S. 285, 287 (1883) (\u201cMunicipal\ncorporations are instrumentalities of the State for the\nconvenient administration of government within their\nlimits\u201d). State political subdivisions are \u201cmerely . . . de\npartment[s] of the State, and the State may withhold,\ngrant or withdraw powers and privileges as it sees fit.\u201d\nTrenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182, 187 (1923). Here the\nIdaho Legislature has elected to withhold from all public\nemployers the power to provide payroll deductions for\npolitical activities.\n  The State\u2019s legislative action is of course subject to First\nAmendment and other constitutional scrutiny whether\nthat action is applicable at the state level, the local level,\nboth, or some subpart of either. But we are aware of no\ncase suggesting that a different analysis applies under the\nFirst Amendment depending on the level of government\n10            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\naffected, and the unions have cited none. The ban on\npolitical payroll deductions furthers Idaho\u2019s interest in\nseparating the operation of government from partisan\npolitics. That interest extends to all public employers at\nwhatever level of government.\n  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court of Ap\npeals invoked our decision in Consolidated Edison Co. of\nN. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530. In\nthat case, we held that a state commission could not,\nconsistent with the First Amendment, prohibit a privately\nowned electric utility from discussing controversial issues\nin its bill inserts. Id., at 544. We ruled that the fact that\nthe State regulated the utility did not authorize the prohi\nbition. Id., at 540. The Court of Appeals concluded that\nthe same analysis applied here, and that \u201cthe State\u2019s\nbroad powers of control over local government entities are\nsolely those of a regulator, analogous to the [state commis\nsion\u2019s] regulatory power over [the private utility].\u201d 504\nF. 3d, at 1065.\n  That analogy is misguided. A private corporation is\nsubject to the government\u2019s legal authority to regulate its\nconduct. A political subdivision, on the other hand, is a\nsubordinate unit of government created by the State to\ncarry out delegated governmental functions. A private\ncorporation enjoys constitutional protections, see First\nNat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 778, n. 14\n(1978), but a political subdivision, \u201ccreated by the state for\nthe better ordering of government, has no privileges or\nimmunities under the federal constitution which it may\ninvoke in opposition to the will of its creator.\u201d Williams v.\nMayor of Baltimore, 289 U.

See ante, at 4, 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4. The\nsole question posed for this Court\u2019s decision is the appro\npriate placement of the State\u2019s political subdivisions: For\nthe purpose at hand, should the Court align local\ngovernment employment with private-sector employment\nor with state-level employment?\n  \u201cGiven the relationship between the State and its politi\ncal subdivisions,\u201d the Court persuasively explains, \u201cit is\nimmaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment.\u201d Ante, at 11. I agree that, in the context here\ninvolved, the Constitution compels no distinction between\nstate and local governmental entities. I therefore join\nParts I and III of the Court\u2019s opinion and concur in the\nCourt\u2019s judgment.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

POCATELLO EDUCATION \n\n             ASSOCIATION ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                     [February 24, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart.\n   In Part III of its opinion, the Court points out that the\nlaw ordinarily treats municipalities as creatures of the\nstate. See Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 575 (1964).\nHence the fact that a state statute, rather than a munici\npal ordinance, limits the use of the municipality\u2019s payroll\ndeduction system is beside the point. I agree that this is\nso, and I agree with JUSTICE SOUTER\u2019s discussion about\nthe relationship between the state and the municipality.\n  I do not agree, however, with the Court\u2019s further analy\nsis of the pertinent legal question\u2014whether the state\nstatute violates the First Amendment. Nor do I agree\nwith its ultimate conclusion. Rather, in my view, we\nshould remand this case for further consideration.\n    The Court\u2019s First Amendment analysis emphasizes its\ncharacterization of the statute as not \u201cabridging\u201d a union\u2019s\nor a worker\u2019s \u201cfreedom of speech,\u201d but rather \u201cdeclin[ing]\nto promote\u201d that speech. Ante, at 1 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I agree that the First Amendment does\nnot prohibit government from \u201cdeclining to promote\u201d\nspeech. It says that government shall not \u201cabridg[e] the\nfreedom of speech.\u201d (Emphasis added) . But I do not think\nthe distinction particularly useful in this case.\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n    That is because here the distinction is neither easy to\ndraw nor likely to prove determinative. Sometimes, I\nconcede, the distinction may help. Were there no payroll\ndeduction system at all and were the unions arguing for\nthe creation of such a system from scratch, one might\ncharacterize their claim as seeking the promotion of\nspeech. But that is not the situation here. A deduction\nsystem already exists. The unions attack a separate\nstatutory provision that removes politically related deduc\ntions from that system. And linguistically speaking, one\nneed not characterize such an attack as (1) seeking speech\npromotion rather than (2) seeking to prevent an abridg\nment of political-speech-related activity that otherwise\n(i.e., in the absence of the exception) would occur. In such\nan instance, the debate over characterization is more\nmetaphysical than practical.\n     More importantly, the characterization quite possibly\ndoes not matter.        Suppose, for example, a somewhat\nsimilar statutory exception picks and chooses among\npolitical causes, prohibiting deductions that help one\npolitical party while permitting deductions that help\nanother. The First Amendment result could not turn upon\nwhether one described the exception as an \u201cabridgment\u201d or\na \u201cpromotion\u201d failure. And, as I shall explain, infra, at 5\u2013\n6, such may be the case here.\n     I disagree with the Court\u2019s characterizations in an\nother respect. The Court says that because the exception\n\u201chas not infringed the unions\u2019 First Amendment rights,\u201d\n\u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d does not apply and, thus, the State \u201cneed\nonly demonstrate a rational basis\u201d\u2014the standard of re\nview applicable to any ordinary legislation that does not\ninfringe fundamental rights\u2014\u201cto justify the ban on politi\ncal payroll deductions.\u201d Ante, at 6 (emphasis added). I\nagree that the exception does not call for \u201cstrict scru\ntiny\u201d\u2014a categorization that almost always proves fatal to\nthe law in question. After all, the exception does not\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

The exception\naffects speech, albeit indirectly, by restricting a channel\nthrough which speech-supporting finance might flow. As a\nresult, the alternative to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d is not necessarily\na form of \u201crational basis\u201d review\u2014a test that almost every\nrestriction will pass. And instead of applying either \u201cstrict\nscrutiny\u201d or \u201crational basis\u201d review to the statutory excep\ntion, I would ask the question that this Court has asked in\nother speech-related contexts, namely whether the statute\nimposes a burden upon speech that is disproportionate in\nlight of the other interests the government seeks to\nachieve.

In doing so, it has considered the\nseriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will\nlikely cause, the importance of the provision\u2019s countervail\ning objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to\nachieve those objectives, and whether there are other less\nrestrictive ways of doing so. In light of these considera\ntions, it has determined whether ultimately the statute\nworks speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its\njustifications. See Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.\nv. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (describing need for a \u201cfit\u201d\nbetween legislative ends and means \u201cwhose scope is \u2018in\nproportion to the interest served\u2019 \u201d); United States v.\nAmerican Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 217\u2013218\n(2003) (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment).\n    Where context calls for \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d one would not\nnecessarily ask these proportionality questions; but I\nwould ask them in other contexts calling for less than\nordinary legislative leeway in light of the fact that consti\ntutionally protected expression is at issue. See id., at 218.\nTo do so, in my view, helps structure what the Court\nsometimes calls an \u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d inquiry. See\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622\n(1994).\n   Applying this analysis here, I would find the statutory\nexception constitutional, but only if I were convinced that\nthe exception applied even handedly among similar politi\ncally related contributions. If so, the provision would still\nnegatively affect speech-related interests, for it would\nclose off one channel through which individuals might\nprovide speech-enabling funds to political institutions.\nBut, as the majority points out, many other channels for\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthose funds exist, and the State has a strong interest in\n\u201cavoiding the reality or appearance of government favorit\nism or entanglement with partisan politics,\u201d ante, at 6. I\nwould consequently find the restriction justified as propor\ntionately serving a legitimate, important governmental\nneed. Cf. Fox, supra, at 480.\n    It is not clear, however, whether the particular excep\ntion before us does, in fact, operate even handedly. To\nread the statute without more, I concede, suggests even\nhandedness. The provision says that \u201c[d]eductions for\npolitical activities as defined in chapter 26, title 44, Idaho\nCode, shall not be deducted from wages, earnings or com\npensation of an employee.\u201d Idaho Code Ann. \u00a744\u20132004(2)\n(Michie 2003) (emphasis added). And chapter 26, title 44,\nIdaho Code, defines \u201cpolitical activities\u201d without special\nreference to labor organizations. See \u00a744\u20132602(e).\n   Nonetheless, certain features of the provision suggest it\nmay affect some politically-related deductions, namely\nlabor-related deductions, but not others. Title 44 of the\nIdaho Code\u2014entitled \u201cLabor\u201d\u2014is about labor activities.\nAnd the ban on payroll deductions for political activities\nwas enacted as part of a statute in which every other pro\nvision is concerned solely with union activities. See Vol\nuntary Contributions Act, 2003 Idaho Sess. Laws chs. 97\nand 340 (codified at Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a744\u20132601 through\n44\u20132605 and \u00a744\u20132004). At the same time, the provision\ncontaining the payroll deduction ban is immediately fol\nlowed by another related provision that expressly men\ntions labor unions. See \u00a744\u20132004(3) (\u201cNothing in this\nchapter shall prohibit an employee from personally paying\ncontributions for political activities . . . to a labor organiza\ntion unless such payment is prohibited by law\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   It is important to know whether the exception concerns\nonly labor-related political deductions (while allowing\nother similar deductions) or treats all alike. A restriction\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nthat applies to the political activities of unions alone\nwould seem unlikely to further the government\u2019s justifying\nobjective, namely providing the appearance of political\nneutrality. And in that case, the provision could well\nbring about speech-related harm that is disproportionate\nto the statute\u2019s tendency to further the government\u2019s\n\u201cneutrality\u201d objective.\n   Because the Court of Appeals analyzed the issue as if\nthe State \u201cregulated\u201d its municipalities (as government\nmight regulate a private firm), it did not resolve the ques\ntions I have just described. I would remand the case so\nthat it can decide whether the parties appropriately raised\nthose matters and, if so, consider them. Accordingly, I\nwould vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision and remand\nthe case.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

In 2003, however, the State\nenacted the Voluntary Contributions Act (VCA), 2003\nSess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho Code \u00a744\u2013\n2004, and \u00a7\u00a744\u20132601 through 44\u20132605 (Michie 2003)),\nwhich, among other things, prohibits employers from\nallowing any payroll deduction for \u201cpolitical activities,\u201d\n\u00a744\u20132004(2). For several reasons, I cannot conclude as the\nCourt does that this restriction on payroll deductions was\nreasonably calculated to further the State\u2019s \u201cinterest in\nseparating the operation of government from partisan\npolitics,\u201d ante, at 10. Because it is clear to me that the\nrestriction was intended to make it more difficult for\nunions to finance political speech, I would hold it unconsti\ntutional in all its applications.\n                             I\n  \u201cIt is axiomatic that the government may not regulate\nspeech based on its substantive content or the message it\nconveys.\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\n2                YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nVa., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995). On its face, \u00a744\u20132004(2)\nrestricts payroll deductions for all political activities, and\npetitioners contend that the State reasonably enacted\n\u00a744\u20132004(2) \u201cto avoid either the appearance or the reality\nof public employer involvement in . . . electoral politics.\u201d\nTr. of Oral Arg. 15. Several features of the statute, how\never, belie its purported viewpoint neutrality.\n   That the restriction was more narrowly intended to\ntarget union fundraising is first evidenced by its statutory\ncontext. The other provisions of the VCA with which \u00a744\u2013\n2004(2) was enacted pertain exclusively to unions.1 For\ninstance, \u00a744\u20132603 requires unions to create separate\nfunds for political activities and places restrictions on\nunions\u2019 solicitation of political contributions; \u00a744\u20132604\nmakes it a misdemeanor, among other things, for unions\nto make expenditures for political activities from union\ndues; and \u00a744\u20132605 establishes registration and reporting\nrequirements for union political funds. The provisions\nproximate to \u00a744\u20132004(2), which were enacted roughly two\ndecades earlier as part of the Right to Work Act, 1985\nSess. Laws ch. 2, \u00a71 (codified at Idaho Code \u00a744\u20132001 et\nseq.), are similarly directed at union activities. Even the\nsubsection immediately preceding \u00a744\u20132004(2) is aimed\nspecifically at unions: \u00a744\u20132004(1) prohibits payroll deduc\ntions for union dues, fees, assessments, or other charges\nwithout an employee\u2019s prior written authorization. And,\nfinally, \u00a744\u20132004(2) is codified in a title of the Idaho Code\nentitled \u201cLabor\u201d and in a chapter entitled \u201cRight to Work.\u201d\nTogether, these statutory features strongly suggest that\nthe Idaho Legislature enacted \u00a744\u20132004(2) specifically to\nimpede union fundraising.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Respondents also challenged these provisions of the VCA, and peti\n\ntioners conceded their invalidity earlier in this litigation, acknowledg\ning that they violated the First Amendment by restricting the ability of\nlabor organizations to solicit political contributions. See Pocatello Ed.\nAssn. v. Heidman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007).\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Petitioners contend that the\nrestriction was enacted to further the State\u2019s interest in\navoiding the appearance or actuality of public employer\ninvolvement in partisan politics. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.\nBut, as enacted, \u00a744\u20132004(2) prohibited private as well as\npublic employers from making payroll deductions for\npolitical activities. As petitioners admitted at oral argu\nment, \u201cthe State has no interest in . . . private employers\u2019\ndetermination to be involved or not involved in political\nmatters.\u201d Id., at 6. That petitioners conceded the invalid\nity of \u00a744\u20132004(2) as applied to private employers earlier\nin this litigation does not require us to ignore the breadth\nof the statute the State enacted in assessing the provi\nsion\u2019s scope and purpose. Consideration of the provision\nactually passed by the legislature makes clear that the\nState\u2019s asserted interest in the restriction is not compati\nble with its breadth.\n   The State\u2019s interest in avoiding the appearance or real\nity of employer political involvement is also inconsistent\nwith its decision not to restrict deductions for charitable\nactivities. Such deductions will often present a similar\nrisk of creating an appearance of political involvement as\ndeductions for covered political activities. Yet the State\nhas made no effort to distinguish this type of political\nactivity. As with the State\u2019s decision to apply \u00a744\u20132004(2)\nto private employers, its failure to apply the restriction to\ncharitable deductions produces a significant mismatch\nbetween the restriction\u2019s reach and its asserted purpose.\n   To my mind, it is clear from these features of the legisla\ntion that \u00a744\u20132004(2)\u2019s prohibition on payroll deductions\nfor \u201cpolitical activities\u201d was intended to target union po\nlitical activity.

The Court of Appeals found this application of\nthe provision invalid due to the State\u2019s failure to show that\nit \u201cactually operates or controls the payroll deduction\nsystems of local units of government.\u201d Pocatello Ed. Assn.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 It\n       may even be true that \u00a744\u20132004(2) only affects union political\nactivity, as petitioners can point to no evidence that another entity is\naffected by the statute. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. But it is unnecessary to\ndetermine whether other entities are actually affected by the restriction\nin light of its clearly discriminatory purpose.\n   3 The discriminatory nature of \u00a744\u20132004(2) distinguishes it from the\n\nrestriction we upheld in Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S.\n177 (2007)\u2014a decision on which the majority heavily relies. In that\ncase, state law authorized public-sector unions to charge nonmembers\nan agency fee equivalent to membership dues and to have employers\ncollect that fee through payroll deductions. Respondent challenged the\nvalidity of a state ballot initiative requiring public-sector unions to\nobtain nonmembers\u2019 affirmative authorization before using their fees\nfor political purposes. We held that the affirmative-authorization\nprovision did not violate respondent\u2019s First Amendment rights because\nit merely placed a viewpoint-neutral limitation on an \u201cextraordinary\u201d\nstate-law entitlement allowing it to collect and spend the money of\ngovernment employees. Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 9, 10). By contrast,\n\u00a744\u20132004(2) is not a limitation on a state-law entitlement that specifi\ncally benefits unions but rather a union-specific exclusion from a\ngenerally available benefit.\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Heidman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1068 (CA9 2007).4 In the\nabsence of evidence of such control, the Court of Appeals\nheld, \u201cthe State has a relatively weak interest in prevent\ning [respondents] from exercising their First Amendment\nrights.\u201d Ibid.\n    Unlike the Court of Appeals, the majority omits any\nexamination of the relationship Idaho has established\nwith its political subdivisions. Rather, the majority finds\nit sufficient to assert that States, as the creators of local\ngovernment, retain the authority to grant or withdraw\nsubdivision powers and privileges. Ante, at 8. The fact of\nthat authority, however, hardly proves that the particular\nrelationship between a State and its political subdivisions\nis irrelevant to our constitutional inquiry. All States do\nnot treat their subdivisions the same, and those differ\nences are sometimes consequential.\n    We have in other contexts recognized the constitutional\nsignificance of the relationship a State chooses to establish\nwith its political subdivisions. For instance, in Mt.\nHealthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280 (1977),\nwe stated that the answer to the question whether a\nschool board should \u201cbe treated as an arm of the State\npartaking of the State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity\n. . . depends, at least in part, upon the nature of the entity\ncreated by state law.\u201d And in McMillian v. Monroe\nCounty, 520 U. S. 781, 786 (1997), we held that whether a\nsheriff has county or state policymaking authority for\npurposes of determining liability under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 is ascertained by reference to \u201cthe actual\nfunction of a government official,\u201d which is in turn \u201cde\npendent on the definition of the official\u2019s functions under\nrelevant state law.\u201d In both cases, the constitutional\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The State conceded at oral argument before the Court of Appeals\n\nthat it is not the proprietor of local government workplaces or their\npayroll deduction programs. See 504 F. 3d, at 1065.\n6             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nanalysis turned in part on the way the State had struc\ntured its relationship with its political subdivisions.\n   Although we have not previously considered the impli\ncations of the state-subdivision relationship in the First\nAmendment context, we have repeatedly recognized the\nsignificance of an analogous inquiry: whether the govern\nment, in imposing speech restrictions, is acting in its\ncapacity as regulator or proprietor. See, e.g., Davenport v.\nWashington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, at ___ (2007) (slip\nop., at 9\u201310); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.\nFund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 805\u2013806 (1985). Accordingly, I\ncannot agree with the majority\u2019s assertion that, because\npolitical subdivisions are instrumentalities of the State, \u201cit\nis immaterial how the State allocates funding or manage\nment responsibilities between the different levels of gov\nernment,\u201d ante, at 11. Relationships between state and\nlocal governments are more varied, and the consequences\nof that variation are more significant, than the majority\u2019s\nanalysis admits.\n   Because my conclusion that \u00a744\u20132004(2) discriminates\nagainst labor organizations is sufficient to decide this case,\nI find it unnecessary to fully consider the implications of\nIdaho\u2019s relationship with its political subdivisions.\nRather, I note the significance of this relationship to urge\nits careful consideration in future cases.\n                               III\n  The majority avoids acknowledging \u00a744\u20132004(2)\u2019s evi\ndently discriminatory purpose only by examining the\nstatute out of context and ignoring its initial applicability\nto private employers. Considering the provision as en\nacted, I cannot find it justified as the majority does by \u201cthe\nState\u2019s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of\ngovernment favoritism or entanglement with partisan\npolitics,\u201d ante, at 6.

POCATELLO EDUCATION \n\n             ASSOCIATION ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [February 24, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SOUTER, dissenting.\n   If I thought this case should be classified solely as one\nabout the First Amendment\u2019s limits on a State\u2019s manage\nment of its own affairs, I would join the judgment, and as\nit is I agree with much of the Court\u2019s opinion. So far as\nIdaho\u2019s law affects freedom of expression, I am not per\nsuaded there is sufficient reason to treat the State\u2019s statu\ntory prohibition differently depending on the unit of its\ngovernment employing the worker whose salary deduction\nwould fund political activity. There is no question in this\ncase that the lower echelons of Idaho government are\ncreatures of the State exercising state power in discharg\ning what are ultimately state responsibilities. Nor is there\nany apparent reason to think the State\u2019s asserted legiti\nmate interest differs according to the level of government\ndoing the State\u2019s work, whether that interest is having a\nfirewall between public administration and politics or\nsimply exercising a power to decide whether public em\nployees who administer payrolls should spend work time\nadvancing private political speech.\n   But I find it impossible to stop there. Although this case\ncomes to us as one about the scope of the public business\nthe State is free, within reasonable limits, to manage as it\nthinks wise, the specter of another First Amendment\n2             YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncategory, one of superior significance, is too insistent to\nignore. It is true that government may choose to manage\nits own affairs in ways that draw reasonable subject\nmatter lines affecting speech, being free, for example, to\nsell space on its buses for advertising soap but not politi\ncians. See Lehman v. Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298\n(1974). But a government is not free to draw those lines\nas a way to discourage or suppress the expression of view\npoints it disagrees with, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal De\nfense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806, 811\u2013812,\n(1985); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn.,\n460 U. S. 37, 46, 49 (1983); only narrow tailoring to serve\na compelling state interest could justify that kind of selec\ntivity, see United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group,\nInc., 529 U. S. 803, 813 (2000).\n   This difference between viewpoint discrimination and\nneutral regulation of governmental activity is on point in\nthis case. For although the State invokes its legitimate\ninterest in keeping public administration free from politi\ncal involvement as its reason for Idaho Code \u00a744\u20132004(2)\n(Michie 2003), this ostensibly viewpoint-neutral rationale\nsuffers from the circumstances JUSTICE STEVENS describes\nin detail, see ante, at 2\u20134 (dissenting opinion). Every\nother provision of the amendatory act in which \u00a744\u2013\n2004(2) was included deals with unions, the statute\namended regulates unions, and all this legislation is\nplaced in the State\u2019s labor law codification. Ante., at 2.\nUnion speech, and nothing else, seems to have been on the\nlegislative mind.\n   The Court\u2019s answer to this recalls Davenport v. Wash\nington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177 (2007), in suggesting that\nIdaho was merely limiting a self-created risk of entangling\npublic administration with politics, which followed from\nauthorizing public payroll deductions for union benefit in\nthe first place, ante, at 7\u20138. But the scope of the state\nenactment that imposes the prohibition places that expla\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)             3\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nnation in question, for the statute goes beyond constrain\ning the government as employer, and criminalizes deduc\ntions for political purposes even when administered by\nprivate employers, an application of the law the State\nconcedes is unconstitutional. Pocatello Ed. Assn. v. Hei\ndeman, 504 F. 3d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007). Hence a reader\nof the statute may fairly suspect that Idaho\u2019s legislative\nobject was not efficient, clean government, but that un\nions\u2019 political viewpoints were its target, selected out of all\nthe politics the State might filter from its public work\nplaces.\n   What to do about this reasonable suspicion of viewpoint\ndiscrimination is a dilemma. We can hardly disregard it,\nfor it affects the weight this case can carry as precedent; a\ndecision that ignores the elephant in the room is a decision\nwith diminished authority. But the potential issue of\nviewpoint discrimination that should be addressed in this\ncase is not before us. Although the unions\u2019 brief alludes to\nviewpoint discrimination in several places, that is not the\nfocus of their argument. The unions, instead, aim at\nshowing that the State is acting as a regulator of local\ngovernments (much as it regulates private corporations),\nnot as a manager setting limits to what government will\ndo with public resources; consequently they rest their\nposition on the argument that any state discrimination\nagainst political speech is illegitimate, however consis\ntently all shades of political speech may be treated. And\neven if we could properly recast the case by remanding to\nconsider viewpoint discrimination, see Cornelius, supra, at\n811\u2013812, a remand could only affect the application of the\nstatute to subordinate units of government; the unions\nhave accepted the constitutionality of applying the law to\nthe State, where an effort at viewpoint discrimination\nwould be as unconstitutional as it would be at the level of\na town.\n   The upshot is that if we decide the case as it comes to us\n4            YSURSA v. POCATELLO ED. ASSN.\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nwe will shut our eyes to a substantial, if not the substan\ntial, issue raised by the facts. But if we were to expand\nthe issues presented to us by remanding for enquiry into\nviewpoint discrimination, we would risk having to wink\nlater at an unconstitutional application of the law to the\nState, owing to the unions\u2019 decision not to challenge that\napplication either in the Ninth Circuit or before us. This\nis a good description of a case that should not be in this\nCourt as a vehicle to refine First Amendment doctrine.\n   I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently\ngranted, and I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
