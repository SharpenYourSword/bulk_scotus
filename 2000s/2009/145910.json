NELSON, AKA ZIKEE v. \n\n               UNITED STATES\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08\u20135657. Decided January 26, 2009\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Lawrence Nelson was convicted of one count of conspir\nacy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute\nmore than 50 grams of cocaine base. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7846.\nThe District Court calculated Nelson\u2019s sentencing range\nunder the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and im\nposed a sentence of 360 months in prison (the bottom of\nthe range). During sentencing, the judge explained that\nunder Fourth Circuit precedent, \u201c \u2018the Guidelines are\nconsidered presumptively reasonable,\u2019 \u201d so that \u201c \u2018unless\nthere\u2019s a good reason in the [statutory sentencing] fac\ntors . . . , the Guideline sentence is the reasonable sen\ntence.\u2019 \u201d Pet. for Cert. 10.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit affirmed Nelson\u2019s conviction and sentence. United\nStates v. Nelson, 237 Fed. Appx. 819 (2007) (per curiam).\nIt noted that within-Guidelines sentences are presump\ntively reasonable, and rejected Nelson\u2019s argument that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s reliance on that presumption was error.\nId., at 821.\n   Nelson filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. We\ngranted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded\nthe case to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in\nlight of Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338 (2007). Nelson\nv. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n   On remand and without further briefing, the Fourth\nCircuit again affirmed the sentence. 276 Fed. Appx. 331\n(2008) (per curiam). The court acknowledged that under\n2                NELSON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nRita, while courts of appeals \u201cmay apply a presumption of\nreasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a\nproper application of the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d 551\nU. S., at 347, \u201cthe sentencing court does not enjoy the\nbenefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sen\ntence should apply,\u201d id., at 351. Instead, the sentencing\ncourt must first calculate the Guidelines range, and then\nconsider what sentence is appropriate for the individual\ndefendant in light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(a), explaining any variance from the former\nwith reference to the latter. Nonetheless, the Fourth\nCircuit upheld the sentence, finding that the District\nCourt did not treat the Guidelines as \u201cmandatory\u201d but\nrather understood that they were only advisory. 276 Fed.\nAppx., at 333.\n  Nelson has again filed a petition for a writ of certiorari,\nreasserting, inter alia, essentially the same argument he\nmade before us the first time: that the District Court\u2019s\nstatements clearly indicate that it impermissibly applied a\npresumption of reasonableness to his Guidelines range.\nThe United States admits that the Fourth Circuit erred in\nrejecting that argument following our remand; we agree.\n  Our cases do not allow a sentencing court to presume\nthat a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range is\nreasonable. In Rita we said as much, in fairly explicit\nterms: \u201cWe repeat that the presumption before us is an\nappellate court presumption. . . . [T]he sentencing court\ndoes not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the\nGuidelines sentence should apply.\u201d 551 U. S., at 351. And\nin Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), we reiter\nated that district judges, in considering how the various\nstatutory sentencing factors apply to an individual defen\ndant, \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines range is\nreasonable.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11\u201312).\n  In this case, the Court of Appeals quoted the above\nlanguage from Rita but affirmed the sentence anyway\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The Guidelines are not only not mandatory on\nsentencing courts; they are also not to be presumed rea\nsonable. We think it plain from the comments of the\nsentencing judge that he did apply a presumption of rea\nsonableness to Nelson\u2019s Guidelines range. Under our\nrecent precedents, that constitutes error.\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.
