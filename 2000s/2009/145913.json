Argued November 4, 2008 \u2014Decided January 26, 2009*\nNuclear utilities generally procure their fuel, \u201clow enriched uranium\u201d\n (LEU), through one of two types of contracts. Under an \u201cenriched\n uranium product\u201d (EUP) contract, the utility simply pays the en\n richer cash for LEU of a desired quantity and \u201cassay,\u201d i.e., its per\n centage of the isotope necessary for a nuclear reaction. The amount\n of energy required to enrich a quantity of \u201cfeed uranium\u201d to a given\n assay is described in terms of an industry standard called a \u201csepara\n tive work unit\u201d (SWU). Under a \u201cSWU contract,\u201d the utility provides\n a quantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the SWUs to\n produce the required LEU quantity and assay. SWU contracts do not\n require that the required number of SWUs actually be applied to the\n utility\u2019s uranium. Because feed uranium is fungible and essentially\n trades like a commodity, and because profitable operation of an en\n richment plant requires the constant processing of feed uranium from\n the enricher\u2019s undifferentiated stock, the LEU provided to a utility\n under a SWU contract cannot be traced to the particular unenriched\n uranium the utility provided.\n    Petitioners (collectively, USEC), who run the only uranium en\n richment factory in the United States, petitioned the Commerce De\n partment (Department) for relief under the Tariff Act of 1930, which\n calls for \u201cantidumping\u201d duties on \u201cforeign merchandise\u201d sold in this\n country at \u201cless than its fair value,\u201d 19 U. S. C. \u00a71673, but does not\n touch international sales of services. USEC alleged that LEU im\n ported from European countries under both EUP and SWU contracts\n was being sold in the United States at less than fair value and was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 07\u20131078, USEC Inc. et al. v.

A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    materially harming domestic industry. In its final determination, the\n    Department concluded that LEU from France, including LEU ac\n    quired under SWU contracts, was being sold here at less than fair\n    value. Among other things, the Department rejected the claim that\n    such transactions were sales of enrichment services, as provided in\n    SWU contracts. The Court of International Trade (CIT) ultimately\n    reversed, noting the \u201clegal fiction\u201d expressed in SWU contracts that\n    the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched\n    and then returned as LEU to the utility. Finding that the record did\n    not support a determination that the enricher has any ownership\n    rights, the CIT reasoned that the Department\u2019s decision was unsup\n    ported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law. The\n    Federal Circuit affirmed, approaching the issues much as the CIT\n    had.\nHeld: The Department\u2019s take on the transactions at issue as sales of\n goods rather than services reflects a permissible interpretation and\n application of \u00a71673. Because \u00a71677(1) gives this determination to\n the Department in the first instance, the Department\u2019s interpretation\n governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the\n contrary or an unreasonable resolution of ambiguous language. See,\n e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n 467 U. S. 837. Two threshold propositions must be accepted. First,\n the Department reasonably concluded that \u00a71673 is not limited by its\n terms to cash-only sales. If that were the case, any sale of a manu\n factured product could be exempted from the section\u2019s operation by a\n contractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of a\n commodity. Second, since public law is not constrained by private\n fiction, see, e.g., Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336, the De\n partment is not bound by the legal fiction created by SWU contracts\n that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is en\n riched and then returned as LEU to the utility. Thus, the test of the\n Department\u2019s position turns first on whether the statute clearly ex\n cludes a transaction involving mixed payment for LEU that may and\n almost certainly will be produced from uranium feed distinct from\n what the utility provides. Although it is undisputed that \u00a71673 ap\n plies to the sale of goods, not services, the section simply does not\n speak with the precision necessary to say definitively whether it ap\n plies to the LEU and the agreement giving the utility a right to get it.\n This is the very situation in which the Court looks to an authoritative\n agency for a decision about a statute\u2019s scope. Once the choice is\n made, the Court asks only whether the Department\u2019s application of\n the statute was reasonable. Where, as here, cash plus an untracked\n fungible commodity are exchanged for a substantially transformed\n version of the same commodity, the Department may reasonably\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  treat the transaction as the sale of a good under \u00a71673. Cf. Powder\n  Co. v. Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116. The Department\u2019s position is re\n  inforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving antidumping du\n  ties\u2019 effectiveness. It is undisputed that such duties apply to LEU\n  sold to a domestic utility by foreign enrichers under an EUP contract\n  calling for a single cash price that is less than fair value. Such a\n  transaction obviously opens the domestic enrichment industry to ma\n  terial injury, the very threat that \u00a71673 was meant to counter. But\n  the same injury will occur if a SWU contract is untouchable. Under a\n  SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for un\n  enriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in ex\n  change for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\n  contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to\n  buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it. And the restruc\n  turing would not stop with uranium; contracts for many types of\n  goods would be replaced by separate contracts for the goods and for\n  processing services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise\n  the uncreative. The Department\u2019s attempt to foreclose this absurd\n  result by treating such transactions as sales of goods is eminently\n  reasonable.

S. C. \u00a71673, but\ndoes not touch international sales of services. These cases\ntest the application of this antidumping provision to im\u00ad\nports of low enriched uranium (LEU), a highly processed\nderivative of natural uranium used as nuclear fuel, when\ndomestic utilities contract to obtain LEU for cash plus\nunenriched uranium delivered to a foreign enricher.\nAlthough the parties\u2019 contracts call these transactions\nsales of uranium enrichment services, the Commerce\nDepartment treats them as sales of \u201cforeign merchandise\u201d\nsubject to the antidumping provision.          The issue is\nwhether the Commerce Department\u2019s way of seeing the\ntransactions as sales of goods rather than services reflects\n2               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na permissible interpretation and application of \u00a71673. We\nhold that it does.\n                                I\n  There are five steps in transforming elemental uranium\ninto fuel rods for nuclear powerplants. After uranium ore\nis mined, it is milled into uranium concentrate called\n\u201cyellowcake,\u201d which is next converted into uranium\nhexafluoride gas or \u201cfeed uranium.\u201d The fissionable iso\u00ad\ntope in unenriched feed uranium is then concentrated,\nproducing LEU in pellet form, which is in turn made into\nuranium fuel rods. These cases are about the fourth step:\nenriching uranium feedstock into LEU.\n  The uranium isotope needed for a nuclear reaction, U\u00ad\n235, amounts only to .711 percent by weight of natural\nuranium. Uranium whose concentration or \u201cassay,\u201d of U\u00ad\n235 has been enhanced to 20 percent or more is weapons\u00ad\ngrade, highly enriched uranium (HEU), whereas LEU has\na U-235 assay of 3 to 5 percent, making it useful as nu\u00ad\nclear fuel. One way to produce LEU, and the method at\nissue in these cases, is gaseous diffusion,1 whereby gase\u00ad\nous feed uranium is pushed through a long series of filters,\nseparating the gas into two streams. The stream passing\nthrough the filters (the \u201cproduct stream\u201d) gains a higher\nconcentration of the lighter U-235 isotope than the stream\nthat is filtered out (the \u201ctails\u201d). Because the concentration\nreached at each individual filter is minor, the gas must be\nforced through hundreds or even thousands of filters, at\ngreat expenditure of electricity, before the product stream\nreaches the desired assay. The amount of energy required\nto enrich a quantity of feed uranium to a given assay is\nmeasured in terms of an industry standard called a \u201csepa\u00ad\nrative work unit\u201d or SWU (pronounced \u201cswoo\u201d). In prac\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 LEU can also be produced through a centrifuge method or by back\u00ad\n\nblending unenriched uranium with weapons-grade uranium.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntice, however, a given degree of enrichment will depend on\nadjusting the quantities of two separate variables, feed\nuranium and electricity, in inverse proportions. Thus, if\nthe electric rate is stable but the value of feed uranium\nfalls, an enricher may produce LEU by \u201coverfeeding,\u201d\nsubjecting a greater quantity of feed uranium to fewer\nSWUs, and when the value of feed uranium goes up and\nelectricity does not, \u201cunderfeeding\u201d can use more SWUs to\nsqueeze extra U-235 from the tails.\n   Nuclear utilities generally get LEU in one of two ways.\nUnder an \u201cenriched uranium product\u201d or \u201cEUP\u201d contract, a\nutility simply buys a desired quantity and assay of LEU\nfor cash. Under a \u201cSWU contract,\u201d the utility provides a\nquantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the\nSWUs to produce the quantity and assay of LEU called\nfor.2 Despite their name, SWU contracts do not require\nthat the contractual number of SWUs actually be applied\nto the quantity of uranium provided, Notice of Final De\u00ad\ntermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Low En\u00ad\nriched Uranium From France, 66 Fed. Reg. 65877, 65884\n(2001) (hereinafter LEU from France); rather, the enricher\nremains free to overfeed or underfeed so long as it delivers\nthe specified LEU. Moreover, because feed uranium is\nfungible, and \u201cfor all intents and purposes, trades like a\ncommodity,\u201d ibid., and because profitable operation of an\nenrichment plant requires the constant processing of feed\nuranium from the enricher\u2019s undifferentiated stock, the\nLEU provided to a utility under a SWU contract cannot be\ntraced to the particular unenriched uranium the utility\nprovided.\n   Petitioners, USEC Inc. and its subsidiary, United States\nEnrichment Corporation, (USEC collectively) run the only\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Many SWU contracts give the utility the option of providing a com\u00ad\n\nparable quantity of uranium concentrate in lieu of the specified feed\nuranium.

First, because the enrich\u00ad\nment process accounts for approximately 60 percent of the\nvalue of LEU and works a \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d on\nuranium feedstock, id., at 65881, enrichment creates \u201cthe\nessential character\u201d of LEU, id., at 65884. Second, \u201cen\u00ad\nrichers not only have complete control over the enrichment\nprocess, but in fact control the level of usage of the natural\nuranium provided.\u201d Ibid. Third, the utilities themselves\ntake no part in the manufacture of LEU and are the sole\npurchasers of the product. Ibid.\n   The Commerce Department also rejected the argument\nthat LEU transferred pursuant to SWU contracts should\nnot be considered \u201csold\u201d in light of a \u201ctolling\u201d regulation\nthen (but no longer) in effect. Ibid. The regulation stated\nthat a \u201ctoller,\u201d a subcontractor who sells processing ser\u00ad\nvices in, or material for incorporation into, subject mer\u00ad\nchandise, would not be considered a manufacturer or\nproducer \u201cwhere the toller or subcontractor does not ac\u00ad\nquire ownership, and does not control the relevant sale, of\nthe subject merchandise.\u201d 19 CFR \u00a7351.401(h) (2000)\n(withdrawn in Import Administration, Withdrawal of\nRegulations Governing the Treatment of Subcontractors,\n(\u201cTolling\u201d Operations), 73 Fed.

Finally, the\nDepartment emphasized that the enrichers \u201chave com\u00ad\nplete control over the enrichment process and control the\namount of uranium and energy actually used in producing\nthe LEU.\u201d Id., at 231a.\n  The CIT was unconvinced and reversed, relying on what\nit candidly recognized as a \u201clegal fiction\u201d expressed in\nSWU contracts, \u201cthat the very feed uranium delivered by a\nutility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as\nLEU to the utility.\u201d USEC Inc. v. United States, 281\nF. Supp. 2d 1334, 1339 (2003). The CIT reasoned, because\n\u201cnothing in the record support[ed] a determination that\nthe enricher has any ownership rights,\u201d the Commerce\nDepartment\u2019s determination was \u201cunsupported by sub\u00ad\nstantial evidence and not in accordance with law.\u201d Id., at\n1340.\n  USEC challenged this conclusion in an interlocutory\nappeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,\nwhich affirmed.

The court approached the issues\nmuch as the CIT had, with the observation that \u201cthe SWU\ncontracts in this case do not evidence any intention by the\nparties to vest the enrichers with ownership rights in the\ndelivered unenriched uranium or the finished LEU.\u201d Id.,\nat 1362. It recalled that in a previous case, Florida Power\n& Light Co. v.

Eurodif I, supra, at 1363, and n. 3\n(quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373).\nWhile the court conceded that SWU agreements \u201cdo \u2018not\nfall neatly\u2019 either into the category of contracts for services\nor the category of contracts for the sale of goods,\u201d 411\nF. 3d, at 1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra,\nat 1373\u20131374), it still concluded that \u201ceven under the\ndeferential standard of review that we apply in this case,\nwe choose not to ignore our previous holdings.\u201d Eurodif I,\nsupra, at 1363.\n  Shortly after this decision, we held in National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,\n545 U. S. 967, 982\u2013983 (2005), that a court\u2019s choice of one\nreasonable reading of an ambiguous statute does not\npreclude an implementing agency from later adopting a\ndifferent reasonable interpretation. On rehearing, the\nFederal Circuit responded to National Cable & Telecom\nmunications Association by explaining that it had not\nrejected the Commerce Department\u2019s position because it\nconflicted with the prior interpretive choice that carried\nthe day in Florida Power & Light. Eurodif S. A. v. United\nStates, 423 F. 3d 1275, 1277\u20131278 (2005) (Eurodif II). The\nCircuit, rather, saw no statutory uncertainty to be re\u00ad\nsolved: \u201cthe antidumping duty statute unambiguously\napplies to the sale of goods and not services\u201d and \u201cit is\nclear that [SWU] contracts are contracts for services and\nnot goods.\u201d Id., at 1278. After final judgment was en\u00ad\ntered, Eurodif S. A. v. United States, 506 F. 3d 1051, 1053\n(CA Fed. 2007) (Eurodif III), we granted certiorari 553\nU.

We now reverse.\n                            II\n  The issue is not whether, for purposes of 19 U. S.

A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sale of services, not goods. The statute gives this\ndetermination to the Department of Commerce in the first\ninstance, \u00a71677(1), and when the Department exercises\nthis authority in the course of adjudication, its interpreta\u00ad\ntion governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory\nlanguage to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of\nlanguage that is ambiguous.6 United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 229\u2013230 (2001) (citing Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984)). This is so even after a change in\nregulatory treatment, which \u201cis not a basis for declining to\nanalyze the agency\u2019s interpretation under the Chevron\nframework.\u201d National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.,\n545 U.

United States, 307 F. 3d 1364 (CA Fed.\n2002), was inconsistent with the Government\u2019s position here, it would\nnot speak to the deference owed the Commerce Department under\nChevron.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncation of \u00a71673, two threshold propositions must be taken\nas given. First, we think the Department reasonably\nconcluded that \u00a71673 is not limited by its terms to cash\u00ad\nonly sales. Otherwise, any sale of a manufactured product\ncould be exempted from the operation of \u00a71673 by a con\u00ad\ntractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of\na commodity.8\n   Second, in applying \u00a71673, the Commerce Department is\nnot bound by the \u201clegal fiction [created by SWU contracts]\nthat the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an\nenricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility.\u201d USEC, 281 F. Supp. 2d, at 1339. The parties are\nfree to contract as they wish, and they may genuinely\nregard SWU agreements as contracts for the sale of en\u00ad\nrichment services. But, whatever the significance of such\na term in a contract dispute, cf. Florida Power & Light\nCo., 307 F. 3d 1364, it is well settled that in reading\nregulatory and taxation statutes, \u201cform should be disre\u00ad\ngarded for substance and the emphasis should be on eco\u00ad\nnomic reality.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336\n(1967). See also Frank Lyon Co. v. United States, 435\nU. S. 561, 573 (1978) (\u201c \u2018In the field of taxation, adminis\u00ad\ntrators of the laws, and the courts, are concerned with\nsubstance and realities, and formal written documents are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Respondents argue that, after determining that SWU contracts\n\ninvolved the sale of LEU, the Commerce Department employed an\nimpermissible methodology by constructing the normal value of the\nLEU based on the combined costs to Eurodif of obtaining feed uranium\nand enrichment. Brief for Respondent Eurodif S. A. et al. 48\u201350. These\ncalculations, respondents argue, \u201cwere a charade, underscoring that the\nantidumping laws cannot be applied to these SWU contracts.\u201d Id., at\n48. To the degree respondents\u2019 argument is that antidumping duties\nmay never be applied to mixed cash-commodity sales, it is doomed by\nimplausibility. If respondents are contending that the Commerce\nDepartment\u2019s dumping determination improperly assessed the normal\nvalue of LEU, they are raising an issue well outside the scope of our\ngrant of certiorari.\n12            UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot rigidly binding\u2019 \u201d (quoting Helvering v. F. & R. Lazarus\n& Co., 308 U. S. 252, 255 (1939))). Surrender to private\ncontractual terms is especially uncalled for in dealing with\ninternational tariffs, as Congress saw when it amended\nthe Tariff Act to say that the sale of foreign merchandise\nincludes \u201cthe entering into of any leasing arrangement\nregarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of\nthe merchandise.\u201d        Trade and Tariff Act of 1984,\n\u00a7602(b)(2), 98 Stat. 3024, 19 U. S C. \u00a71673.\n  Since public law is not constrained by private fiction,\nthe test of the Department\u2019s position turns first on\nwhether the statute clearly excludes a transaction involv\u00ad\ning mixed payment for LEU that may and almost certainly\nwill be produced from uranium feed distinct from what the\nutility provides. No one disputes that \u00a71673 applies to the\nsale of goods, not services, LEU From France, 66 Fed. Reg.\n65882\u201365883. Nor do we think anyone would deny that\nthe exchange of cash combined with a commodity for a\nproduct that uses that very commodity as a constituent\nmaterial is sometimes a sale of services and sometimes a\nsale of goods, the distinction being clear at the extremes.\nA customer who comes to a laundry with cash and dirty\nshirts is clearly purchasing cleaning services, not clean\nshirts. And a customer who provides cash and sand to a\nmanufacturer of generic silicon processors is clearly\nbuying computer chips rather than sand enhancement\nservices.\n  But the line blurs when the facts get more complicated,\nand SWU contracts exemplify a class of transactions that\nthe Federal Circuit recognized does \u201c \u2018not fall neatly\u2019 either\ninto the category of contracts for services or the category of\ncontracts for the sale of goods.\u201d Eurodif I, 411 F. 3d, at\n1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373\u2013\n1374). The agreement is not like the laundry ticket, which\nsays that the same shirts are supposed to come back, just\nminus the dirt around the collar. And it is not on all fours\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the agreement of the chip buyer and the manufac\u00ad\nturer, in which it is inescapable that the silicon processors\ndelivered are a separate good from the sand provided.\nSection 1673 simply does not speak with the precision\nnecessary to say definitively whether it applies to the LEU\nand the agreement that gives the utility a right to get it.\n  This is the very situation in which we look to an au\u00ad\nthoritative agency for a decision about the statute\u2019s scope,\nwhich is defined in cases at the statutory margin by the\nagency\u2019s application of it, and once the choice is made we\nask only whether the Department\u2019s application was rea\u00ad\nsonable. As to that, the Commerce Department relied on\ntwo related characteristics of these transactions in decid\u00ad\ning SWU contracts should be treated as a sale of LEU. It\nstressed that the utility in a SWU contract provides cash\nplus a fungible commodity that is not tracked after its\ndelivery to the enricher, in exchange for a product owned\nby the enricher.9 And it recognized that the enrichment\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Eurodif  argues that the Commerce Department erred in concluding\nthat enrichers own LEU prior to its delivery under a SWU contract.\nId., at 36\u201337. While the precise form of this argument is unclear, it\nfails under any reading. Respondents seem to mean that the Com\u00ad\nmerce Department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71673 is impermissible as being\ninconsistent with the formal terms of SWU contracts, an argument we\nrejected above. The argument could also be read to suggest that the\nCommerce Department lacked substantial evidence to conclude that,\ncontractual formalities aside, enrichers in fact own the LEU provided\nunder SWU contracts prior to its delivery. But the evidence in the\nrecord not only supports the Department\u2019s conclusion, it compels it. It\nis undisputed that the LEU delivered under a SWU contract is not\nactually derived from the feed uranium provided as consideration; as\nCIT observed, the notion that the same feed uranium delivered by a\nutility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility is \u201ca legal fiction.\u201d USEC Inc. v. United States, 281 F. Supp. 2d\n1334, 1339 (2003). Moreover, the enricher is free to vary the amount of\nfeed uranium used to produce an order of LEU, either stockpiling feed\nuranium or supplementing its stores from other sources. Finally, the\nSWU contracts at issue provide that the utility retains title to the feed\nuranium until delivery of the LEU, at which point it obtains title in the\n14              UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess results in a substantial transformation of the\nunenriched uranium.\n  The combination of these characteristics reasonably\ncaptures a common understanding of the sale of a good.\nBecause an individual\u2019s shirts are not fungible, they are\ntracked during the cleaning process and returned to the\nsame customer who brought them in; there are no good\nreasons to treat them as owned for a time by the laundry,\nand no one does. And without any transfer of ownership,\nthe salient feature of the transaction is the cleaning of the\nshirt, a service. Conversely, where a constituent material\nis untracked and fungible, ownership is usually seen as\ntransferred, and the transaction is less likely to be a sale\nof services, as the Court explained years ago in distin\u00ad\nguishing a common-law bailment from a sale:\n     \u201c[W]here logs are delivered to be sawed into boards, or\n     leather to be made into shoes, rags into paper, olives\n     into oil, grapes into wine, wheat into flour, if the\n     product of the identical articles delivered is to be re\u00ad\n     turned to the original owner in a new form, it is said\n     to be a bailment, and the title never vests in the\n     manufacturer. If, on the other hand, the manufac\u00ad\n     turer is not bound to return the same wheat or flour\n     or paper, but may deliver any other of equal value, it\n     is said to be a sale or a loan, and the title to the thing\n     delivered vests in the manufacturer.\u201d Powder Co. v.\n     Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116 (1878).10\nAnd when the manufacturer is not only free to return\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLEU. In light of this process, some entity must own the LEU prior to\ndelivery and obtain title to the feed uranium after delivery, absent\nsome modern analog to the abhorrent possibility of an abeyance of\nseizen; the enricher is the only serious candidate.\n   10 Common law definitions do not necessarily control the meaning of\n\nterms in modern trade laws; we merely mean to show the long pedigree\nof the distinction relied upon by the Commerce Department.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent material, but also substantially transforms the\nmaterial it uses, it is even more likely that the object of\nthe transaction will be seen as a new product, not work on\nenduring material of primary interest to the buyer. After\nall, what makes the hypothetical exchange of sand\nfor silicon processors so obviously a sale of goods is the\nextreme transformation brought about by the chip\nmanufacturer.\n   These are good analytical grounds to show that SWU\ntransactions are reasonably placed within the ambit of\nsale of goods, and the Department\u2019s reliance on them is\nreinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving the\neffectiveness of antidumping duties. There is no dispute\nthat LEU sold under an EUP contract at less than fair\nvalue must be subjected to antidumping duties under\n\u00a71673, there being a clear sale of goods when a domestic\nutility pays a single sale price in cash for the feed uranium\nand enrichment components represented by LEU. If\nforeign enrichers set this price below the fair value of\nLEU, the domestic enrichment industry is obviously open\nto material injury, the very threat the antidumping stat\u00ad\nute was meant to counter, see H. R. Rep. No. 1, at 23. But\nthe same injury would occur if a SWU contract were un\u00ad\ntouchable. Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility\npays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and\nprovides this along with additional cash in exchange for\nLEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\ncontract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one\ncontract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich\nit.11 And the restructuring would not stop with uranium;\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 This would be particularly easy in these cases, since COGEMA,\n\nEurodif\u2019s parent company, \u201cis a major world supplier of natural ura\u00ad\nnium for the production of LEU.\u201d Final Remand Determination, App. G\nto Pet. for Cert. 221a, n. 38. In fact, many SWU contracts provide that\nif a utility fails to deliver feed uranium, the enricher will substitute\nfeed uranium of its own, which may then be purchased from the en\u00ad\n16               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncontracts for imported pasta would be replaced by sepa\u00ad\nrate contracts for wheat and wheat processing services,\nsweater imports would give way to separate contracts for\nwool and knitting services, and antidumping duties would\nprimarily chastise the uncreative.12 The Commerce De\u00ad\npartment\u2019s attempt to foreclose this absurd result by\ntreating SWU transactions as sales of goods is eminently\nreasonable.\n                            III\n   Where a domestic buyer\u2019s cash and an untracked, fungi\u00ad\nble commodity are exchanged with a foreign contractor for\na substantially transformed version of the same commod\u00ad\nity, the Commerce Department may reasonably treat the\ntransaction as the sale of a good under \u00a71673. We there\u00ad\nfore reverse the judgment of the Federal Circuit and re\u00ad\nmand the cases for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nricher.

Under an \u201cenriched\n uranium product\u201d (EUP) contract, the utility simply pays the en\n richer cash for LEU of a desired quantity and \u201cassay,\u201d i.e., its per\n centage of the isotope necessary for a nuclear reaction. The amount\n of energy required to enrich a quantity of \u201cfeed uranium\u201d to a given\n assay is described in terms of an industry standard called a \u201csepara\n tive work unit\u201d (SWU). Under a \u201cSWU contract,\u201d the utility provides\n a quantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the SWUs to\n produce the required LEU quantity and assay. SWU contracts do not\n require that the required number of SWUs actually be applied to the\n utility\u2019s uranium. Because feed uranium is fungible and essentially\n trades like a commodity, and because profitable operation of an en\n richment plant requires the constant processing of feed uranium from\n the enricher\u2019s undifferentiated stock, the LEU provided to a utility\n under a SWU contract cannot be traced to the particular unenriched\n uranium the utility provided.\n    Petitioners (collectively, USEC), who run the only uranium en\n richment factory in the United States, petitioned the Commerce De\n partment (Department) for relief under the Tariff Act of 1930, which\n calls for \u201cantidumping\u201d duties on \u201cforeign merchandise\u201d sold in this\n country at \u201cless than its fair value,\u201d 19 U. S. C. \u00a71673, but does not\n touch international sales of services. USEC alleged that LEU im\n ported from European countries under both EUP and SWU contracts\n was being sold in the United States at less than fair value and was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 07\u20131078, USEC Inc. et al. v. Eurodif S. A. et al.,\nalso on certiorari to the same court.\n2                  UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    materially harming domestic industry. In its final determination, the\n    Department concluded that LEU from France, including LEU ac\n    quired under SWU contracts, was being sold here at less than fair\n    value. Among other things, the Department rejected the claim that\n    such transactions were sales of enrichment services, as provided in\n    SWU contracts. The Court of International Trade (CIT) ultimately\n    reversed, noting the \u201clegal fiction\u201d expressed in SWU contracts that\n    the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is enriched\n    and then returned as LEU to the utility. Finding that the record did\n    not support a determination that the enricher has any ownership\n    rights, the CIT reasoned that the Department\u2019s decision was unsup\n    ported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law. The\n    Federal Circuit affirmed, approaching the issues much as the CIT\n    had.\nHeld: The Department\u2019s take on the transactions at issue as sales of\n goods rather than services reflects a permissible interpretation and\n application of \u00a71673. Because \u00a71677(1) gives this determination to\n the Department in the first instance, the Department\u2019s interpretation\n governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory language to the\n contrary or an unreasonable resolution of ambiguous language. See,\n e.g., Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n 467 U. S. 837. Two threshold propositions must be accepted. First,\n the Department reasonably concluded that \u00a71673 is not limited by its\n terms to cash-only sales. If that were the case, any sale of a manu\n factured product could be exempted from the section\u2019s operation by a\n contractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of a\n commodity. Second, since public law is not constrained by private\n fiction, see, e.g., Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336, the De\n partment is not bound by the legal fiction created by SWU contracts\n that the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an enricher is en\n riched and then returned as LEU to the utility. Thus, the test of the\n Department\u2019s position turns first on whether the statute clearly ex\n cludes a transaction involving mixed payment for LEU that may and\n almost certainly will be produced from uranium feed distinct from\n what the utility provides. Although it is undisputed that \u00a71673 ap\n plies to the sale of goods, not services, the section simply does not\n speak with the precision necessary to say definitively whether it ap\n plies to the LEU and the agreement giving the utility a right to get it.\n This is the very situation in which the Court looks to an authoritative\n agency for a decision about a statute\u2019s scope. Once the choice is\n made, the Court asks only whether the Department\u2019s application of\n the statute was reasonable. Where, as here, cash plus an untracked\n fungible commodity are exchanged for a substantially transformed\n version of the same commodity, the Department may reasonably\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  treat the transaction as the sale of a good under \u00a71673. Cf. Powder\n  Co. v. Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116. The Department\u2019s position is re\n  inforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving antidumping du\n  ties\u2019 effectiveness. It is undisputed that such duties apply to LEU\n  sold to a domestic utility by foreign enrichers under an EUP contract\n  calling for a single cash price that is less than fair value. Such a\n  transaction obviously opens the domestic enrichment industry to ma\n  terial injury, the very threat that \u00a71673 was meant to counter. But\n  the same injury will occur if a SWU contract is untouchable. Under a\n  SWU contract, the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for un\n  enriched uranium and provides this along with additional cash in ex\n  change for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\n  contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one contract to\n  buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich it. And the restruc\n  turing would not stop with uranium; contracts for many types of\n  goods would be replaced by separate contracts for the goods and for\n  processing services, and antidumping duties would primarily chastise\n  the uncreative. The Department\u2019s attempt to foreclose this absurd\n  result by treating such transactions as sales of goods is eminently\n  reasonable.

S. C. \u00a71673, but\ndoes not touch international sales of services. These cases\ntest the application of this antidumping provision to im\u00ad\nports of low enriched uranium (LEU), a highly processed\nderivative of natural uranium used as nuclear fuel, when\ndomestic utilities contract to obtain LEU for cash plus\nunenriched uranium delivered to a foreign enricher.\nAlthough the parties\u2019 contracts call these transactions\nsales of uranium enrichment services, the Commerce\nDepartment treats them as sales of \u201cforeign merchandise\u201d\nsubject to the antidumping provision.          The issue is\nwhether the Commerce Department\u2019s way of seeing the\ntransactions as sales of goods rather than services reflects\n2               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\na permissible interpretation and application of \u00a71673. We\nhold that it does.\n                                I\n  There are five steps in transforming elemental uranium\ninto fuel rods for nuclear powerplants. After uranium ore\nis mined, it is milled into uranium concentrate called\n\u201cyellowcake,\u201d which is next converted into uranium\nhexafluoride gas or \u201cfeed uranium.\u201d The fissionable iso\u00ad\ntope in unenriched feed uranium is then concentrated,\nproducing LEU in pellet form, which is in turn made into\nuranium fuel rods. These cases are about the fourth step:\nenriching uranium feedstock into LEU.\n  The uranium isotope needed for a nuclear reaction, U\u00ad\n235, amounts only to .711 percent by weight of natural\nuranium. Uranium whose concentration or \u201cassay,\u201d of U\u00ad\n235 has been enhanced to 20 percent or more is weapons\u00ad\ngrade, highly enriched uranium (HEU), whereas LEU has\na U-235 assay of 3 to 5 percent, making it useful as nu\u00ad\nclear fuel. One way to produce LEU, and the method at\nissue in these cases, is gaseous diffusion,1 whereby gase\u00ad\nous feed uranium is pushed through a long series of filters,\nseparating the gas into two streams. The stream passing\nthrough the filters (the \u201cproduct stream\u201d) gains a higher\nconcentration of the lighter U-235 isotope than the stream\nthat is filtered out (the \u201ctails\u201d). Because the concentration\nreached at each individual filter is minor, the gas must be\nforced through hundreds or even thousands of filters, at\ngreat expenditure of electricity, before the product stream\nreaches the desired assay. The amount of energy required\nto enrich a quantity of feed uranium to a given assay is\nmeasured in terms of an industry standard called a \u201csepa\u00ad\nrative work unit\u201d or SWU (pronounced \u201cswoo\u201d). In prac\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 LEU can also be produced through a centrifuge method or by back\u00ad\n\nblending unenriched uranium with weapons-grade uranium.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  3\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntice, however, a given degree of enrichment will depend on\nadjusting the quantities of two separate variables, feed\nuranium and electricity, in inverse proportions. Thus, if\nthe electric rate is stable but the value of feed uranium\nfalls, an enricher may produce LEU by \u201coverfeeding,\u201d\nsubjecting a greater quantity of feed uranium to fewer\nSWUs, and when the value of feed uranium goes up and\nelectricity does not, \u201cunderfeeding\u201d can use more SWUs to\nsqueeze extra U-235 from the tails.\n   Nuclear utilities generally get LEU in one of two ways.\nUnder an \u201cenriched uranium product\u201d or \u201cEUP\u201d contract, a\nutility simply buys a desired quantity and assay of LEU\nfor cash. Under a \u201cSWU contract,\u201d the utility provides a\nquantity of feed uranium and pays the enricher for the\nSWUs to produce the quantity and assay of LEU called\nfor.2 Despite their name, SWU contracts do not require\nthat the contractual number of SWUs actually be applied\nto the quantity of uranium provided, Notice of Final De\u00ad\ntermination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Low En\u00ad\nriched Uranium From France, 66 Fed. Reg. 65877, 65884\n(2001) (hereinafter LEU from France); rather, the enricher\nremains free to overfeed or underfeed so long as it delivers\nthe specified LEU. Moreover, because feed uranium is\nfungible, and \u201cfor all intents and purposes, trades like a\ncommodity,\u201d ibid., and because profitable operation of an\nenrichment plant requires the constant processing of feed\nuranium from the enricher\u2019s undifferentiated stock, the\nLEU provided to a utility under a SWU contract cannot be\ntraced to the particular unenriched uranium the utility\nprovided.\n   Petitioners, USEC Inc. and its subsidiary, United States\nEnrichment Corporation, (USEC collectively) run the only\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Many SWU contracts give the utility the option of providing a com\u00ad\n\nparable quantity of uranium concentrate in lieu of the specified feed\nuranium.

A.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nIn deciding that SWU contracts are for a sale of LEU, not\nenrichment services, the Department stressed several\nfeatures of the transactions. First, because the enrich\u00ad\nment process accounts for approximately 60 percent of the\nvalue of LEU and works a \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d on\nuranium feedstock, id., at 65881, enrichment creates \u201cthe\nessential character\u201d of LEU, id., at 65884. Second, \u201cen\u00ad\nrichers not only have complete control over the enrichment\nprocess, but in fact control the level of usage of the natural\nuranium provided.\u201d Ibid. Third, the utilities themselves\ntake no part in the manufacture of LEU and are the sole\npurchasers of the product. Ibid.\n   The Commerce Department also rejected the argument\nthat LEU transferred pursuant to SWU contracts should\nnot be considered \u201csold\u201d in light of a \u201ctolling\u201d regulation\nthen (but no longer) in effect. Ibid. The regulation stated\nthat a \u201ctoller,\u201d a subcontractor who sells processing ser\u00ad\nvices in, or material for incorporation into, subject mer\u00ad\nchandise, would not be considered a manufacturer or\nproducer \u201cwhere the toller or subcontractor does not ac\u00ad\nquire ownership, and does not control the relevant sale, of\nthe subject merchandise.\u201d 19 CFR \u00a7351.401(h) (2000)\n(withdrawn in Import Administration, Withdrawal of\nRegulations Governing the Treatment of Subcontractors,\n(\u201cTolling\u201d Operations), 73 Fed.

Eurodif S. A. v. United States, 411 F. 3d\n1355 (2005) (Eurodif I). The court approached the issues\nmuch as the CIT had, with the observation that \u201cthe SWU\ncontracts in this case do not evidence any intention by the\nparties to vest the enrichers with ownership rights in the\ndelivered unenriched uranium or the finished LEU.\u201d Id.,\nat 1362. It recalled that in a previous case, Florida Power\n& Light Co. v. United States, 307 F. 3d 1364 (CA Fed.\n2002), it had accepted the Government\u2019s position that\nSWU contracts were for services, not for \u201c \u2018disposal of\npersonal property,\u2019 \u201d and so were outside the cause of\naction provided by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Eurodif I, supra, at 1363, and n. 3\n(quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373).\nWhile the court conceded that SWU agreements \u201cdo \u2018not\nfall neatly\u2019 either into the category of contracts for services\nor the category of contracts for the sale of goods,\u201d 411\nF. 3d, at 1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra,\nat 1373\u20131374), it still concluded that \u201ceven under the\ndeferential standard of review that we apply in this case,\nwe choose not to ignore our previous holdings.\u201d Eurodif I,\nsupra, at 1363.\n  Shortly after this decision, we held in National Cable &\nTelecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,\n545 U. S. 967, 982\u2013983 (2005), that a court\u2019s choice of one\nreasonable reading of an ambiguous statute does not\npreclude an implementing agency from later adopting a\ndifferent reasonable interpretation. On rehearing, the\nFederal Circuit responded to National Cable & Telecom\nmunications Association by explaining that it had not\nrejected the Commerce Department\u2019s position because it\nconflicted with the prior interpretive choice that carried\nthe day in Florida Power & Light. Eurodif S. A. v. United\nStates, 423 F. 3d 1275, 1277\u20131278 (2005) (Eurodif II). The\nCircuit, rather, saw no statutory uncertainty to be re\u00ad\nsolved: \u201cthe antidumping duty statute unambiguously\napplies to the sale of goods and not services\u201d and \u201cit is\nclear that [SWU] contracts are contracts for services and\nnot goods.\u201d Id., at 1278. After final judgment was en\u00ad\ntered, Eurodif S. A. v. United States, 506 F. 3d 1051, 1053\n(CA Fed. 2007) (Eurodif III), we granted certiorari 553\nU. S. ___ (2008), to consider whether transactions under\nSWU contracts may be subjected to antidumping duties\nunder the Tariff Act. We now reverse.\n                            II\n  The issue is not whether, for purposes of 19 U. S. C.\n\u00a71673, the better view is that a SWU contract is one for\n10               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe sale of services, not goods. The statute gives this\ndetermination to the Department of Commerce in the first\ninstance, \u00a71677(1), and when the Department exercises\nthis authority in the course of adjudication, its interpreta\u00ad\ntion governs in the absence of unambiguous statutory\nlanguage to the contrary or unreasonable resolution of\nlanguage that is ambiguous.6 United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 229\u2013230 (2001) (citing Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984)). This is so even after a change in\nregulatory treatment, which \u201cis not a basis for declining to\nanalyze the agency\u2019s interpretation under the Chevron\nframework.\u201d National Cable & Telecommunications Assn.,\n545 U. S., at 981. \u201c \u2018[T]he whole point of Chevron is to\nleave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a stat\u00ad\nute with the implementing agency.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Smiley\nv.

For the reasons given by the Department in its\nremand determination, we are not convinced that the tolling regulation\nprecludes viewing SWU transactions as the sale of LEU; but even if it\ndid, it has since been withdrawn, Tolling Operations, 73 Fed. Reg.\n16517, and cannot now constrain the Commerce Department\u2019s interpre\u00ad\ntive authority under Chevron. National Cable & Telecommunications\nAssn., 545 U. S., at 981 (\u201cUnexplained inconsistency is, at most, a\nreason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious\nchange from agency practice under the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d).\nLikewise, even if the position taken by the Department of Energy in\nFlorida Power & Light Co. v. United States, 307 F. 3d 1364 (CA Fed.\n2002), was inconsistent with the Government\u2019s position here, it would\nnot speak to the deference owed the Commerce Department under\nChevron.\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncation of \u00a71673, two threshold propositions must be taken\nas given. First, we think the Department reasonably\nconcluded that \u00a71673 is not limited by its terms to cash\u00ad\nonly sales. Otherwise, any sale of a manufactured product\ncould be exempted from the operation of \u00a71673 by a con\u00ad\ntractual term stating part of the purchase price in terms of\na commodity.8\n   Second, in applying \u00a71673, the Commerce Department is\nnot bound by the \u201clegal fiction [created by SWU contracts]\nthat the very feed uranium delivered by a utility to an\nenricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility.\u201d USEC, 281 F. Supp. 2d, at 1339. The parties are\nfree to contract as they wish, and they may genuinely\nregard SWU agreements as contracts for the sale of en\u00ad\nrichment services. But, whatever the significance of such\na term in a contract dispute, cf. Florida Power & Light\nCo., 307 F. 3d 1364, it is well settled that in reading\nregulatory and taxation statutes, \u201cform should be disre\u00ad\ngarded for substance and the emphasis should be on eco\u00ad\nnomic reality.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 336\n(1967). See also Frank Lyon Co. v. United States, 435\nU. S. 561, 573 (1978) (\u201c \u2018In the field of taxation, adminis\u00ad\ntrators of the laws, and the courts, are concerned with\nsubstance and realities, and formal written documents are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Respondents argue that, after determining that SWU contracts\n\ninvolved the sale of LEU, the Commerce Department employed an\nimpermissible methodology by constructing the normal value of the\nLEU based on the combined costs to Eurodif of obtaining feed uranium\nand enrichment. Brief for Respondent Eurodif S. A. et al. 48\u201350. These\ncalculations, respondents argue, \u201cwere a charade, underscoring that the\nantidumping laws cannot be applied to these SWU contracts.\u201d Id., at\n48. To the degree respondents\u2019 argument is that antidumping duties\nmay never be applied to mixed cash-commodity sales, it is doomed by\nimplausibility. If respondents are contending that the Commerce\nDepartment\u2019s dumping determination improperly assessed the normal\nvalue of LEU, they are raising an issue well outside the scope of our\ngrant of certiorari.\n12            UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnot rigidly binding\u2019 \u201d (quoting Helvering v. F. & R. Lazarus\n& Co., 308 U. S. 252, 255 (1939))). Surrender to private\ncontractual terms is especially uncalled for in dealing with\ninternational tariffs, as Congress saw when it amended\nthe Tariff Act to say that the sale of foreign merchandise\nincludes \u201cthe entering into of any leasing arrangement\nregarding the merchandise that is equivalent to the sale of\nthe merchandise.\u201d        Trade and Tariff Act of 1984,\n\u00a7602(b)(2), 98 Stat. 3024, 19 U. S C. \u00a71673.\n  Since public law is not constrained by private fiction,\nthe test of the Department\u2019s position turns first on\nwhether the statute clearly excludes a transaction involv\u00ad\ning mixed payment for LEU that may and almost certainly\nwill be produced from uranium feed distinct from what the\nutility provides. No one disputes that \u00a71673 applies to the\nsale of goods, not services, LEU From France, 66 Fed. Reg.\n65882\u201365883. Nor do we think anyone would deny that\nthe exchange of cash combined with a commodity for a\nproduct that uses that very commodity as a constituent\nmaterial is sometimes a sale of services and sometimes a\nsale of goods, the distinction being clear at the extremes.\nA customer who comes to a laundry with cash and dirty\nshirts is clearly purchasing cleaning services, not clean\nshirts. And a customer who provides cash and sand to a\nmanufacturer of generic silicon processors is clearly\nbuying computer chips rather than sand enhancement\nservices.\n  But the line blurs when the facts get more complicated,\nand SWU contracts exemplify a class of transactions that\nthe Federal Circuit recognized does \u201c \u2018not fall neatly\u2019 either\ninto the category of contracts for services or the category of\ncontracts for the sale of goods.\u201d Eurodif I, 411 F. 3d, at\n1364 (quoting Florida Power & Light Co., supra, at 1373\u2013\n1374). The agreement is not like the laundry ticket, which\nsays that the same shirts are supposed to come back, just\nminus the dirt around the collar. And it is not on all fours\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the agreement of the chip buyer and the manufac\u00ad\nturer, in which it is inescapable that the silicon processors\ndelivered are a separate good from the sand provided.\nSection 1673 simply does not speak with the precision\nnecessary to say definitively whether it applies to the LEU\nand the agreement that gives the utility a right to get it.\n  This is the very situation in which we look to an au\u00ad\nthoritative agency for a decision about the statute\u2019s scope,\nwhich is defined in cases at the statutory margin by the\nagency\u2019s application of it, and once the choice is made we\nask only whether the Department\u2019s application was rea\u00ad\nsonable. As to that, the Commerce Department relied on\ntwo related characteristics of these transactions in decid\u00ad\ning SWU contracts should be treated as a sale of LEU. It\nstressed that the utility in a SWU contract provides cash\nplus a fungible commodity that is not tracked after its\ndelivery to the enricher, in exchange for a product owned\nby the enricher.9 And it recognized that the enrichment\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Eurodif  argues that the Commerce Department erred in concluding\nthat enrichers own LEU prior to its delivery under a SWU contract.\nId., at 36\u201337. While the precise form of this argument is unclear, it\nfails under any reading. Respondents seem to mean that the Com\u00ad\nmerce Department\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71673 is impermissible as being\ninconsistent with the formal terms of SWU contracts, an argument we\nrejected above. The argument could also be read to suggest that the\nCommerce Department lacked substantial evidence to conclude that,\ncontractual formalities aside, enrichers in fact own the LEU provided\nunder SWU contracts prior to its delivery. But the evidence in the\nrecord not only supports the Department\u2019s conclusion, it compels it. It\nis undisputed that the LEU delivered under a SWU contract is not\nactually derived from the feed uranium provided as consideration; as\nCIT observed, the notion that the same feed uranium delivered by a\nutility to an enricher is enriched and then returned as LEU to the\nutility is \u201ca legal fiction.\u201d USEC Inc. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"818877\"><a href=\"/opinion/818877/usec-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1334</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1339 (2003). Moreover, the enricher is free to vary the amount of\nfeed uranium used to produce an order of LEU, either stockpiling feed\nuranium or supplementing its stores from other sources. Finally, the\nSWU contracts at issue provide that the utility retains title to the feed\nuranium until delivery of the LEU, at which point it obtains title in the\n14              UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nprocess results in a substantial transformation of the\nunenriched uranium.\n  The combination of these characteristics reasonably\ncaptures a common understanding of the sale of a good.\nBecause an individual\u2019s shirts are not fungible, they are\ntracked during the cleaning process and returned to the\nsame customer who brought them in; there are no good\nreasons to treat them as owned for a time by the laundry,\nand no one does. And without any transfer of ownership,\nthe salient feature of the transaction is the cleaning of the\nshirt, a service. Conversely, where a constituent material\nis untracked and fungible, ownership is usually seen as\ntransferred, and the transaction is less likely to be a sale\nof services, as the Court explained years ago in distin\u00ad\nguishing a common-law bailment from a sale:\n     \u201c[W]here logs are delivered to be sawed into boards, or\n     leather to be made into shoes, rags into paper, olives\n     into oil, grapes into wine, wheat into flour, if the\n     product of the identical articles delivered is to be re\u00ad\n     turned to the original owner in a new form, it is said\n     to be a bailment, and the title never vests in the\n     manufacturer. If, on the other hand, the manufac\u00ad\n     turer is not bound to return the same wheat or flour\n     or paper, but may deliver any other of equal value, it\n     is said to be a sale or a loan, and the title to the thing\n     delivered vests in the manufacturer.\u201d Powder Co. v.\n     Burkhardt, 97 U. S. 110, 116 (1878).10\nAnd when the manufacturer is not only free to return\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLEU. In light of this process, some entity must own the LEU prior to\ndelivery and obtain title to the feed uranium after delivery, absent\nsome modern analog to the abhorrent possibility of an abeyance of\nseizen; the enricher is the only serious candidate.\n   10 Common law definitions do not necessarily control the meaning of\n\nterms in modern trade laws; we merely mean to show the long pedigree\nof the distinction relied upon by the Commerce Department.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent material, but also substantially transforms the\nmaterial it uses, it is even more likely that the object of\nthe transaction will be seen as a new product, not work on\nenduring material of primary interest to the buyer. After\nall, what makes the hypothetical exchange of sand\nfor silicon processors so obviously a sale of goods is the\nextreme transformation brought about by the chip\nmanufacturer.\n   These are good analytical grounds to show that SWU\ntransactions are reasonably placed within the ambit of\nsale of goods, and the Department\u2019s reliance on them is\nreinforced by practical reasons aimed at preserving the\neffectiveness of antidumping duties. There is no dispute\nthat LEU sold under an EUP contract at less than fair\nvalue must be subjected to antidumping duties under\n\u00a71673, there being a clear sale of goods when a domestic\nutility pays a single sale price in cash for the feed uranium\nand enrichment components represented by LEU. If\nforeign enrichers set this price below the fair value of\nLEU, the domestic enrichment industry is obviously open\nto material injury, the very threat the antidumping stat\u00ad\nute was meant to counter, see H. R. Rep. No. 1, at 23. But\nthe same injury would occur if a SWU contract were un\u00ad\ntouchable. Under a SWU contract, the domestic utility\npays cash to a third party for unenriched uranium and\nprovides this along with additional cash in exchange for\nLEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a SWU\ncontract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one\ncontract to buy unenriched uranium and another to enrich\nit.11 And the restructuring would not stop with uranium;\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 This would be particularly easy in these cases, since COGEMA,\n\nEurodif\u2019s parent company, \u201cis a major world supplier of natural ura\u00ad\nnium for the production of LEU.\u201d Final Remand Determination, App. G\nto Pet. for Cert. 221a, n. 38. In fact, many SWU contracts provide that\nif a utility fails to deliver feed uranium, the enricher will substitute\nfeed uranium of its own, which may then be purchased from the en\u00ad\n16               UNITED STATES v. EURODIF S. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncontracts for imported pasta would be replaced by sepa\u00ad\nrate contracts for wheat and wheat processing services,\nsweater imports would give way to separate contracts for\nwool and knitting services, and antidumping duties would\nprimarily chastise the uncreative.12 The Commerce De\u00ad\npartment\u2019s attempt to foreclose this absurd result by\ntreating SWU transactions as sales of goods is eminently\nreasonable.\n                            III\n   Where a domestic buyer\u2019s cash and an untracked, fungi\u00ad\nble commodity are exchanged with a foreign contractor for\na substantially transformed version of the same commod\u00ad\nity, the Commerce Department may reasonably treat the\ntransaction as the sale of a good under \u00a71673. We there\u00ad\nfore reverse the judgment of the Federal Circuit and re\u00ad\nmand the cases for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nricher. App. 13\u201314, 185\u2013186, 537 (Sealed).\n   12 Eurodif suggests the Commerce Department could combat such\n\ncircumvention of antidumping duties by taxing domestic downstream\nsales of such products. Brief for Respondent Eurodif S. A. et al. 53\u201354.\nBut this ignores the substantial number of manufactured goods that\nare not resold. More fundamentally, this argument fails to explain why\nthe Commerce Department should be required to chase after down\u00ad\nstream resellers when the first sale has the same economic substance.\n</pre>",
