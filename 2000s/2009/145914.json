PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT \n\n     SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \n\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n    No. 07\u2013636.     Argued October 7, 2008\u2014Decided January 26, 2009 \n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as\n  relevant here, obligates administrators to manage ERISA plans \u201cin\n  accordance with the documents and instruments governing\u201d them, 29\n  U. S. C. \u00a71104(a)(1)(D); requires covered pension benefit plans to\n  \u201cprovide that benefits . . . may not be assigned or alienated,\u201d\n  \u00a71056(d)(1); and exempts from this bar qualified domestic relations\n  orders (QDROs), \u00a71056(d)(3). The decedent, William Kennedy, par\n  ticipated in his employer\u2019s savings and investment plan (SIP), with\n  power both to designate a beneficiary to receive the funds upon his\n  death and to replace or revoke that designation as prescribed by the\n  plan administrator. Under the terms of the plan, if there is no sur\n  viving spouse or designated beneficiary at the time of death, distribu\n  tion is made as directed by the estate\u2019s executor or administrator.\n  Upon their marriage, William designated Liv Kennedy his SIP bene\n  ficiary and named no contingent beneficiary. Their subsequent di\n  vorce decree divested Liv of her interest in the SIP benefits, but Wil\n  liam did not execute a document removing Liv as the SIP beneficiary.\n  On William\u2019s death, petitioner Kari Kennedy, his daughter and the\n  executrix of his Estate, asked for the SIP funds to be distributed to\n  the Estate, but the plan administrator relied on William\u2019s designa\n  tion form and paid them to Liv. The Estate filed suit, alleging that\n  Liv had waived her SIP benefits in the divorce and thus respondents,\n  the employer and the SIP plan administrator (together, DuPont), had\n  violated ERISA by paying her. As relevant here, the District Court\n  entered summary judgment for the Estate, ordering DuPont to pay\n  the benefits to the Estate. The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that\n2     KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV. \n\n                   AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    Liv\u2019s waiver was an assignment or alienation of her interest to the\n    Estate barred by \u00a71056(d)(1).\nHeld:\n    1. Because Liv did not attempt to direct her interest in the SIP\n benefits to the Estate or any other potential beneficiary, her waiver\n did not constitute an assignment or alienation rendered void under\n \u00a71056(d)(1). Pp. 5\u201313.\n       (a) Given the legal meaning of \u201cassigned\u201d and \u201calienated,\u201d it is\n fair to say that Liv did not assign or alienate anything to William or\n to the Estate. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s broad reading\u2014that Liv\u2019s waiver\n indirectly transferred her interest to the next possible beneficiary,\n here the Estate\u2014is questionable. It would be odd to speak of an es\n tate as the transferee of its own decedent\u2019s property or of the dece\n dent in his lifetime as his own transferee. It would also be strange\n under the Treasury Regulation that defines \u201cassignment\u201d and \u201calien\n ation.\u201d Moreover, it is difficult to see how certain waivers not barred\n by the antialienation provision e.g., a surviving spouse\u2019s ability to\n waive a survivor\u2019s annuity or lump-sum payment, see Boggs v. Boggs,\n 520 U. S. 833, 843; 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71055(a), (b)(1)(C), (c)(2), would be\n permissible under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading. These doubts, and ex\n ceptions calling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading into question, point the\n Court toward the law of trusts that \u201cserves as ERISA\u2019s backdrop.\u201d\n Beck v. PACE Int\u2019l Union, 551 U. S. 96, 101. Section 1056(d)(1) is\n much like a spendthrift trust provision barring assignment or alien\n ation of a benefit, see Boggs, supra, at 852, and the cognate trust law\n is highly suggestive here. The general principle that a designated\n spendthrift beneficiary can disclaim his trust interest magnifies the\n improbability that a statute written with an eye on the old law would\n effectively force a beneficiary to take an interest willy-nilly. The\n Treasury reads its own regulation to mean that the antialienation\n provision is not violated by a beneficiary\u2019s waiver \u201cwhere the benefi\n ciary does not attempt to direct her interest in pension benefits to\n another person.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18. Being\n neither \u201cplainly erroneous [n]or inconsistent with the regulation,\u201d the\n Treasury Department\u2019s interpretation is controlling. Auer v. Rob\n bins, 519 U. S. 452, 461. ERISA\u2019s QDRO provisions shed no light on\n the validity of a waiver by a non-QDRO. Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (b) DuPont\u2019s additional reasons for saying that ERISA barred\n Liv\u2019s waiver are unavailing. Pp. 11\u201313.\n    2. Although Liv\u2019s waiver was not nullified by \u00a71056\u2019s express\n terms, the plan administrator did its ERISA duty by paying the SIP\n benefits to Liv in conformity with the plan documents. ERISA pro\n vides no exception to the plan administrator\u2019s duty to act in accor\n dance with plan documents. Thus, the Estate\u2019s claim stands or falls\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  by \u201cthe terms of the plan,\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), a straightfor\n  ward rule that lets employers \u201c \u2018establish a uniform administrative\n  scheme, [with] a set of standard procedures to guide processing of\n  claims and disbursement of benefits,\u2019 \u201d Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S.\n  141, 148. By giving a plan participant a clear set of instructions for\n  making his own instructions clear, ERISA forecloses any justification\n  for enquiries into expressions of intent, in favor of the virtues of ad\n  hering to an uncomplicated rule. Less certain rules could force plan\n  administrators to examine numerous external documents purporting\n  to be waivers and draw them into litigation like this over those waiv\n  ers\u2019 meaning and enforceability. The guarantee of simplicity is not\n  absolute, since a QDRO\u2019s enforceability may require an administra\n  tor to look for beneficiaries outside plan documents notwithstanding\n  \u00a71104(a)(1)(D). But an administrator enforcing a QDRO must be said\n  to enforce plan documents, not ignore them, and a QDRO enquiry is\n  relatively discrete, given its specific and objective criteria. These are\n  good and sufficient reasons for holding the line, just as the Court did\n  in holding that ERISA preempted state laws that could blur the\n  bright-line requirement to follow plan documents in distributing\n  benefits. See Boggs, supra, at 850, and Egelhoff, supra, at 143. What\n  goes for inconsistent state law goes for a federal common law of\n  waiver that might obscure a plan administrator\u2019s duty to act \u201cin ac\n  cordance with the documents and instruments.\u201d See Mertens v. Hew\n  itt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 259. This case points out the wisdom of\n  protecting the plan documents rule. Under the SIP, Liv was Wil\n  liam\u2019s designated beneficiary. The plan provided a way to disclaim\n  an interest in the SIP account, which Liv did not purport to follow.\n  The plan administrator therefore did exactly what \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) re\n  quired and paid Liv the benefits.

PLAN ADMINISTRATOR \n\n       FOR DUPONT SAVINGS AND INVEST- \n\n               MENT PLAN ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 26, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, 29 U. S. C. \u00a71001 et seq., generally\nobligates administrators to manage ERISA plans \u201cin\naccordance with the documents and instruments govern\u00ad\ning\u201d them. \u00a71104(a)(1)(D). At a more specific level, the\nAct requires covered pension benefit plans to \u201cprovide that\nbenefits . . . under the plan may not be assigned or alien\u00ad\nated,\u201d \u00a71056(d)(1), but this bar does not apply to qualified\ndomestic relations orders (QDROs), \u00a71056(d)(3). The\nquestion here is whether the terms of the limitation on\nassignment or alienation invalidated the act of a divorced\nspouse, the designated beneficiary under her ex-husband\u2019s\nERISA pension plan, who purported to waive her entitle\u00ad\nment by a federal common law waiver embodied in a\ndivorce decree that was not a QDRO. We hold that such a\nwaiver is not rendered invalid by the text of the antialien\u00ad\nation provision, but that the plan administrator properly\ndisregarded the waiver owing to its conflict with the des\u00ad\nignation made by the former husband in accordance with\n2    KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV. \n\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nplan documents.\n                               I\n    The decedent, William Kennedy, worked for E. I. Du-\nPont de Nemours & Company and was a participant in its\nsavings and investment plan (SIP), with power both to\n\u201cdesignate any beneficiary or beneficiaries . . . to receive\nall or part\u201d of the funds upon his death, and to \u201creplace or\nrevoke such designation.\u201d App. 48. The plan requires\n\u201c[a]ll authorizations, designations and requests concerning\nthe Plan [to] be made by employees in the manner pre\u00ad\nscribed by the [plan administrator],\u201d id., at 52, and pro\u00ad\nvides forms for designating or changing a beneficiary, id.,\nat 34, 56\u201357. If at the time the participant dies \u201cno sur\u00ad\nviving spouse exists and no beneficiary designation is in\neffect, distribution shall be made to, or in accordance with\nthe directions of, the executor or administrator of the\ndecedent\u2019s estate.\u201d Id., at 48.\n    The SIP is an ERISA \u201c \u2018employee pension benefit plan,\u2019 \u201d\n497 F. 3d 426, 427 (CA5 2007); 29 U. S. C. \u00a71002(2), and\nthe parties do not dispute that the plan satisfies ERISA\u2019s\nantialienation provision, \u00a71056(d)(1), which requires it to\n\u201cprovide that benefits provided under the plan may not be\nassigned or alienated.\u201d1 The plan does, however, permit a\nbeneficiary to submit a \u201cqualified disclaimer\u201d of benefits as\ndefined under the Tax Code, see 26 U. S. C. \u00a72518, which\nhas the effect of switching the beneficiary to an \u201calternate\n. . . determined according to a valid beneficiary designa\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The plan states that \u201c[e]xcept as provided by Section 401(a)(13) of\n\nthe [Internal Revenue] Code, no assignment of the rights or interests of\naccount holders under this Plan will be permitted or recognized, nor\nshall such rights or interests be subject to attachment or other legal\nprocesses for debts.\u201d App. 50\u201351. Title 26 U. S. C. \u00a7401(a)(13)(A), in\nlanguage substantially tracking the text of \u00a71056(d)(1), provides that\n\u201c[a] trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless\nthe plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided\nunder the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\u201d\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

William and\nLiv divorced in 1994, subject to a decree that Liv \u201cis . . .\ndivested of all right, title, interest, and claim in and to . . .\n[a]ny and all sums . . . the proceeds [from], and any other\nrights related to any . . . retirement plan, pension plan, or\nlike benefit program existing by reason of [William\u2019s] past\nor present or future employment.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n64\u201365. William did not, however, execute any documents\nremoving Liv as the SIP beneficiary, 497 F. 3d, at 428,\neven though he did execute a new beneficiary-designation\nform naming his daughter, Kari Kennedy, as the benefici\u00ad\nary under DuPont\u2019s Pension and Retirement Plan, also\ngoverned by ERISA.\n   On William\u2019s death in 2001, petitioner Kari Kennedy\nwas named executrix and asked DuPont to distribute the\nSIP funds to William\u2019s Estate. Ibid. DuPont, instead,\nrelied on William\u2019s designation form and paid the balance\nof some $400,000 to Liv. Ibid. The Estate then sued\nrespondents DuPont and the SIP plan administrator\n(together, DuPont), claiming that the divorce decree\namounted to a waiver of the SIP benefits on Liv\u2019s part,\nand that DuPont had violated ERISA by paying the bene\u00ad\nfits to William\u2019s designee.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Estate now says that William\u2019s beneficiary-designation form for\nthe Pension and Retirement Plan applied to the SIP as well, but the\nform on its face applies only to DuPont\u2019s \u201cPension and Retirement\nPlan.\u201d App. 62. In the District Court, in fact, the Estate stipulated\nthat William \u201cnever executed any forms or documents to remove or\nreplace Liv Kennedy as his sole beneficiary under either the SIP or [a\nplan that merged into the SIP].\u201d Id., at 28. In any event, the Estate\ndid not raise this argument in the Court of Appeals, and we will not\n4    KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV. \n\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   So far as it matters here, the District Court entered\nsummary judgment for the Estate, to which it ordered\nDuPont to pay the value of the SIP benefits. The court\nrelied on Fifth Circuit precedent establishing that a bene\u00ad\nficiary can waive his rights to the proceeds of an ERISA\nplan \u201c \u2018provided that the waiver is explicit, voluntary, and\nmade in good faith.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 38 (quoting\nManning v. Hayes, 212 F. 3d 866, 874 (CA5 2000)).\n   The Fifth Circuit nonetheless reversed, distinguishing\nprior decisions enforcing federal common law waivers of\nERISA benefits because they involved life-insurance poli\u00ad\ncies, which are considered \u201c \u2018welfare plan[s]\u2019 \u201d under ERISA\nand consequently free of the antialienation provision. 497\nF. 3d, at 429. The Court of Appeals held that Liv\u2019s waiver\nconstituted an assignment or alienation of her interest in\nthe SIP benefits to the Estate, and so could not be hon\u00ad\nored. Id., at 430. The court relied heavily on the ERISA\nprovision for bypassing the antialienation provision when\na marriage breaks up: under 29 U. S. C. \u00a71056(d)(3),3 a\ncourt order that satisfies certain statutory requirements is\nknown as a qualified domestic relations order, which is\nexempt from the bar on assignment or alienation. Be\u00ad\ncause the Kennedys\u2019 divorce decree was not a QDRO, the\nFifth Circuit reasoned that it could not give effect to Liv\u2019s\nwaiver incorporated in it, given that \u201cERISA provides a\nspecific mechanism\u2014the QDRO\u2014for addressing the\nelimination of a spouse\u2019s interest in plan benefits, but that\nmechanism is not invoked.\u201d 497 F. 3d, at 431.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\naddress it in the first instance. See Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 \n\nU. S. 638, 645\u2013646 (1992).\n  3 Section 1056(d)(3)(A) provides that the antialienation provision\n\n\u201cshall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any\nbenefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic\nrelations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is\ndetermined to be a qualified domestic relations order.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

S. ___ (2008). We subsequently realized that this case\nimplicates the further split over whether a beneficiary\u2019s\nfederal common law waiver of plan benefits is effective\nwhere that waiver is inconsistent with plan documents,5\nand after oral argument we invited supplemental briefing\non that latter issue, upon which the disposition of this case\nultimately turns. We now affirm, albeit on reasoning\ndifferent from the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rationale.\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  By its terms, the antialienation provision, \u00a71056(d)(1),\nrequires a plan to provide expressly that benefits be nei\u00ad\nther \u201cassigned\u201d nor \u201calienated,\u201d the operative verbs having\nhistories of legal meaning: to \u201cassign\u201d is \u201c[t]o transfer; as\nto assign property, or some interest therein,\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 152 (4th rev. ed. 1968), and to \u201calienate\u201d is \u201c[t]o\nconvey; to transfer the title to property,\u201d id., at 96.

PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV. \n\n                 AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nshoes.\n  The Fifth Circuit saw the waiver as an assignment or\nalienation to the Estate, thinking that Liv\u2019s waiver trans\u00ad\nferred the SIP benefits to whoever would be next in line;\nwithout a designated contingent beneficiary, the Estate\nwould take them. The court found support in the applica\u00ad\nble Treasury Department regulation that defines \u201cassign\u00ad\nment\u201d and \u201calienation\u201d to include\n    \u201c[a]ny direct or indirect arrangement (whether revo\u00ad\n    cable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a\n    participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforce\u00ad\n    able against the plan in, or to, all or any part of a plan\n    benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to\n    the participant or beneficiary.\u201d 26 CFR \u00a71.401(a)\u2013\n    13(c)(1)(ii) (2008).\nSee Boggs v. Boggs, 520 U. S. 833, 851\u2013852 (1997) (relying\nupon the regulation to interpret the meaning of \u201cassign\u00ad\nment\u201d and \u201calienation\u201d in \u00a71056(d)(1)).         The Circuit\ntreated Liv\u2019s waiver as an \u201c \u2018indirect arrangement\u2019 \u201d\nwhereby the Estate gained an \u201c \u2018interest enforceable\nagainst the plan.\u2019 \u201d 497 F. 3d, at 430.\n   Casting the alienation net this far, though, raises ques\u00ad\ntions that leave one in doubt. Although it is possible to\nspeak of the waiver as an \u201carrangement\u201d having the indi\u00ad\nrect effect of a transfer to the next possible beneficiary, it\nwould be odd usage to speak of an estate as the transferee\nof its own decedent\u2019s property, just as it would be to speak\nof the decedent in his lifetime as his own transferee. And\ntreating the estate or even the ultimate estate beneficiary\nas the assignee or transferee would be strange under the\nterms of the regulation: it would be hard to say the estate\nor future beneficiary \u201cacquires\u201d a right or interest when at\nthe time of the waiver there was no estate and the benefi\u00ad\nciary of a future estate might be anyone\u2019s guess. If there\nwere a contingent beneficiary (or the participant made a\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsubsequent designation) the estate would get no interest;\nas for an estate beneficiary, the identity could ultimately\nturn on the law of intestacy applied to facts as yet un\u00ad\nknown, or on the contents of the participant\u2019s subsequent\nwill, or simply on the participant\u2019s future exercise of (or\nfailure to invoke) the power to designate a new beneficiary\ndirectly under the terms of the plan. Thus, if such a\nwaiver created an \u201carrangement\u201d assigning or transferring\nanything under the statute, the assignor would be blind\u00ad\nfolded, operating, at best, on the fringe of what \u201cassign\u00ad\nment\u201d or \u201calienation\u201d normally suggests.\n   The questionability of this broad reading is confirmed by\nexceptions to it that are apparent right off the bat. Take\nthe case of a surviving spouse\u2019s interest in pension bene\u00ad\nfits, for example. Depending on the circumstances, a\nsurviving spouse has a right to a survivor\u2019s annuity or to a\nlump-sum payment on the death of the participant, unless\nthe spouse has waived the right and the participant has\neliminated the survivor annuity benefit or designated a\ndifferent beneficiary. See Boggs, supra, at 843; 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71055(a), (b)(1)(C), (c)(2). This waiver by a spouse is\nplainly not barred by the antialienation provision. Like\u00ad\nwise, DuPont concedes that a qualified disclaimer under\nthe Tax Code, which allows a party to refuse an interest in\nproperty and thereby eliminate federal tax, would not\nviolate the antialienation provision. See Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndents 21\u201323; 26 U. S. C. \u00a72518. In each example, though,\nwe fail to see how these waivers would be permis-\nsible under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of the statute and\nregulation.\n   Our doubts, and the exceptions that call the Fifth Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s reading into question, point us toward authority we\nhave drawn on before, the law of trusts that \u201cserves as\nERISA\u2019s backdrop.\u201d Beck v. PACE Int\u2019l Union, 551 U. S.\n96, 101 (2007). We explained before that \u00a71056(d)(1) is\nmuch like a spendthrift trust provision barring assign\u00ad\n8    KENNEDY v.

Al\u00ad\nthough the beneficiary of a spendthrift trust traditionally\nlacked the means to transfer his beneficial interest to\nanyone else, he did have the power to disclaim prior to\naccepting it, so long as the disclaimer made no attempt to\ndirect the interest to a beneficiary in his stead. See 2\nRestatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a758(1), Comment c, p. 359\n(2001) (\u201cA designated beneficiary of a spendthrift trust is\nnot required to accept or retain an interest prescribed by\nthe terms of the trust. . . . On the other hand, a purported\ndisclaimer by which the beneficiary attempts to direct who\nis to receive the interest is a precluded transfer\u201d); E. Gris\u00ad\nwold, Spendthrift Trusts \u00a7524, p. 603 (2d ed. 1947) (\u201cThe\nAmerican cases, though not entirely clear, generally take\nthe view that the interest under a spendthrift trust may\nbe disclaimed\u201d); Roseberry v.

E. 2d 4, 6 (1993) (\u201c \u2018If a trust is created without\nnotice to the beneficiary or the beneficiary has not ac\u00ad\ncepted the beneficial interest under the trust, he can\ndisclaim\u2019 \u201d (quoting 1 A. Scott & W. Fratcher, Law of\nTrusts \u00a736.1, p. 389 (4th ed. 1987) (hereinafter Fratcher))).\n   We do not mean that the whole law of spendthrift trusts\nand disclaimers turns up in \u00a71056(d)(1), but the general\nprinciple that a designated spendthrift can disclaim his\ntrust interest magnifies the improbability that a statute\nwritten with an eye on the old law would effectively force a\nbeneficiary to take an interest willy-nilly. Common sense\nand common law both say that \u201c[t]he law certainly is not\nso absurd as to force a man to take an estate against his\nwill.\u201d Townson v.

It is true that the receipt of considera\u00ad\ntion prevents a beneficiary from making a qualified disclaimer for gift\ntax purposes, see 26 CFR \u00a725.2518\u20132 (2008), and there is common law\nauthority for the proposition that a renunciation by a devisee is ineffec\u00ad\ntive against existing creditors if \u201cit is shown that those who would take\nsuch property on renunciation had agreed to pay to the devisee some\u00ad\nthing of value in consideration of such renunciation.\u201d 6 W.

But at\ncommon law the receipt of consideration did not necessarily render a\ndisclaimer invalid. See Commerce Trust Co. v. Fast, 396 S. W. 2d 683,\n686\u2013687 (Mo. 1965); Central Nat. Bank v.

In any event, our point\nis not that Liv\u2019s waiver was a valid disclaimer at common law: only that\nreading the terms of 29 U. S. C. \u00a71056(d)(1) to bar all non-QDRO\nwaivers is unsound in light of background common law principles.\n   7 It is true that the Government\u2019s position regarding the applicability\n\nof the antialienation provision to a waiver has fluctuated. The Labor\nDepartment previously took the position that \u201capplication of such a\nfederal common-law waiver rule to pension plans would conflict with\nERISA\u2019s anti-alienation provision.\u201d Brief for Secretary of Labor as\n10   KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV.\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Fifth Circuit found \u201csignificant support\u201d for its\ncontrary holding in the QDRO subsections, reasoning that\n\u201c[i]n the marital-dissolution context, the QDRO provisions\nsupply the sole exception to the anti-alienation provision,\u201d\n497 F. 3d, at 430, a point that echoes in DuPont\u2019s argu\u00ad\nment here. But the negative implication of the QDRO\nlanguage is not that simple. If a QDRO provided a way for\na former spouse like Liv merely to waive benefits, this\nwould be powerful evidence that the antialienation provi\u00ad\nsion was meant to deny any effect to a waiver within a\ndivorce decree but not a QDRO, else there would have\nbeen no need for the QDRO exception. But this is not so,\nand DuPont\u2019s argument rests on a false premise. In fact, a\nbeneficiary seeking only to relinquish her right to benefits\ncannot do this by a QDRO, for a QDRO by definition re\u00ad\nquires that it be the \u201ccreat[ion] or recogni[tion of] the\nexistence of an alternate payee\u2019s right to, or assign[ment]\nto an alternate payee [of] the right to, receive all or a\nportion of the benefits payable with respect to a partici\u00ad\npant under a plan.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a71056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I). There\nis no QDRO for a simple waiver; there must be some\nsucceeding designation of an alternate payee.8 Not being a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAmicus Curiae 16 in Keen v.

S., at\n462.\n   8 Even if one understands Liv\u2019s waiver to have resulted somehow in\n\nher interest reverting to William, he does not qualify as an \u201calternate\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmechanism for simply renouncing a claim to benefits,\nthen, the QDRO provisions shed no light on whether a\nbeneficiary may waive by a non-QDRO.\n  In sum, Liv did not attempt to direct her interest in the\nSIP benefits to the Estate or any other potential benefici\u00ad\nary, and accordingly we think that the better view is that\nher waiver did not constitute an assignment or alienation\nrendered void under the terms of \u00a71056(d)(1).\n                             B\n  DuPont has three other reasons for saying that Liv\u2019s\nwaiver was barred by ERISA. They are unavailing.\n  First, it argues that even if the waiver is not an assign\u00ad\nment or alienation barred under the terms of \u00a71056(d)(1),\n\u00a71056(d)(3)(A) still prohibits it, in providing that\n\u00a71056(d)(1) \u201cshall apply to the creation, assignment, or\nrecognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect\nto a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order\n[that is not a QDRO].\u201d At the very least, DuPont reasons,\nLiv\u2019s waiver included a \u201crecognition\u201d of William\u2019s rights\nwith respect to the SIP benefits. But DuPont overlooks\nthe point that when subsection (d)(3)(A) provides that the\nbar to assignments or alienations extends to non-QDRO\ndomestic relations orders, it does nothing to expand the\nscope of prohibited assignment and alienation under\nsubsection (d)(1). Whether Liv\u2019s action is seen as a\nwaiver or as a domestic relations order that incorpor\u00ad\nated a waiver, subsection (d)(1) does not cover it and\n\u00a71056(d)(3)(A) does not independently bar it.\n  Second, DuPont relies upon \u00a71056(d)(3)(H)(iii)(II), pro\u00ad\nviding that if a domestic relations order is not a QDRO,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npayee,\u201d which is defined by statute as \u201cany spouse, former spouse, child,\nor other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic\nrelations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the\nbenefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a71056(d)(3)(K).\n12   KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV.\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts\n(including any interest thereon) to the person or persons\nwho would have been entitled to such amounts if there\nhad been no order.\u201d According to DuPont, because the\ndivorce decree was not a QDRO this provision calls for\npaying benefits as if there had been no order. But DuPont\nhas wrenched this language out of its setting, reading\nclause (iii) of subparagraph (H) as if there were no clause\n(i):\n     \u201cDuring any period in which the issue of whether a\n     domestic relations order is a qualified domestic rela\u00ad\n     tions order is being determined . . . the plan adminis\u00ad\n     trator shall separately account for the amounts (here\u00ad\n     inafter in this subparagraph referred to as the\n     \u2018segregated amounts\u2019) which would have been payable\n     to the alternate payee during such period if the order\n     had been determined to be a qualified domestic rela\u00ad\n     tions order.\u201d \u00a71056(d)(3)(H)(i).\nThus it is clear that subparagraph (H) speaks of a domes\u00ad\ntic relations order that distributes certain benefits (the\n\u201csegregated amounts\u201d) to an alternate payee, when the\nquestion for the plan administrator is whether the order is\neffective as a QDRO. That is the circumstance in which,\nfor want of a QDRO, clause (iii) tells the plan administra\u00ad\ntor not to pay the alternate, but to distribute the segre\u00ad\ngated amounts as if there had been no order. Clause (iii)\ndoes not, as DuPont suggests, state a general rule that a\nnon-QDRO domestic relations order is a nullity in any\nproceeding that would affect the determination of a bene\u00ad\nficiary. And of course clause (iii) says nothing here at all;\nthe divorce decree names no alternate payee, and there\nare consequently no \u201csegregated amounts.\u201d\n   Third, DuPont claims that a plan cannot recognize a\nwaiver of benefits in a non-QDRO divorce decree because\nERISA preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmay now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,\u201d\nwith \u201cState law\u201d being defined to include \u201cdecisions\u201d or\n\u201cother State action having the effect of law.\u201d9 \u00a7\u00a71144(a),\n(c)(1). DuPont says that Liv\u2019s waiver, expressed in a state\u00ad\ncourt decision and related to an employee benefit plan, is\nthus preempted. But recognizing a waiver in a divorce\ndecree would not be giving effect to state law; the argu\u00ad\nment is that the waiver should be treated as a creature of\nfederal common law, in which case its setting in a state\ndivorce decree would be only happenstance. A court would\nmerely be applying federal law to a document that might\nalso have independent significance under state law. See,\ne.g., Melton v. Melton, 324 F. 3d 941, 945\u2013946 (CA7 2003);\nClift v. Clift, 210 F. 3d 268, 271\u2013272 (CA5 2000); Lyman\nLumber Co. v.

See\n\u00a71144(b)(7).\n  10 Despite our following answer to the question here, our conclusion\n\nthat \u00a71056(d)(1) does not make a nullity of a waiver leaves open any\nquestions about a waiver\u2019s effect in circumstances in which it is consis\u00ad\ntent with plan documents. Nor do we express any view as to whether\nthe Estate could have brought an action in state or federal court\nagainst Liv to obtain the benefits after they were distributed. Compare\nBoggs v.

The very enforceability of\nQDROs means that sometimes a plan administrator must\nlook for the beneficiaries outside plan documents notwith\u00ad\nstanding \u00a71104(a)(1)(D); \u00a71056(d)(3)(J) provides that a\n\u201cperson who is an alternate payee under a [QDRO] shall\nbe considered for purposes of any provision of [ERISA] a\nbeneficiary under the plan.\u201d But this in effect means that\n16   KENNEDY v.

In any case, a\nQDRO enquiry is relatively discrete, given the specific and\nobjective criteria for a domestic relations order that quali\u00ad\nfies as a QDRO,12 see \u00a7\u00a71056(d)(3)(C), (D), requirements\nthat amount to a statutory checklist working to \u201cspare [an\nadministrator] from litigation-fomenting ambiguities,\u201d\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Wheaton, 42 F. 3d 1080, 1084\n(CA7 1994). This is a far cry from asking a plan adminis\u00ad\ntrator to figure out whether a claimed federal common law\nwaiver was knowing and voluntary, whether its language\naddressed the particular benefits at issue, and so forth, on\ninto factually complex and subjective determinations. See,\ne.g., Altobelli, supra, at 83 (Wilkinson, C.

A domestic relations order cannot qualify as a QDRO if\nit requires a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option,\nnot otherwise provided under the plan; requires the plan to provide\nincreased benefits; or requires the payment of benefits to an alternate\npayee that are required to be paid to another alternate payee under\nanother order previously determined to be a QDRO. \u00a71056(d)(3)(D).

We said the law was at\nfault for standing in the way of making payments \u201csimply\nby identifying the beneficiary specified by the plan docu\u00ad\nments,\u201d id., at 148, and thus for purporting to \u201cundermine\nthe congressional goal of \u2018minimiz[ing] the administrative\nand financial burden[s]\u2019 on plan administrators,\u201d id., at\n149\u2013150 (quoting Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.

And this case does as\nwell as any other in pointing out the wisdom of protecting\nthe plan documents rule. Under the terms of the SIP Liv\nwas William\u2019s designated beneficiary. The plan provided\nan easy way for William to change the designation, but for\n18   KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV.\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nwhatever reason he did not. The plan provided a way to\ndisclaim an interest in the SIP account, but Liv did not\npurport to follow it.13 The plan administrator therefore\ndid exactly what \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) required: \u201cthe documents\ncontrol, and those name [the ex-wife].\u201d McMillan v.\nParrott, 913 F. 2d 310, 312 (CA6 1990).\n  It is no answer, as the Estate argues, that William\u2019s\nbeneficiary-designation form should not control because it\nis not one of the \u201cdocuments and instruments governing\nthe plan\u201d under \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) and was not treated as a\nplan document by the plan administrator. That is beside\nthe point. It is uncontested that the SIP and the summary\nplan description are \u201cdocuments and instruments govern\u00ad\ning the plan.\u201d See Curtiss-Wright Corp., 514 U. S., at 84\n(explaining that 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71024(b)(2) and (b)(4) require\na plan administrator to make available the \u201cgoverning\nplan documents\u201d). Those documents provide that the plan\nadministrator will pay benefits to a participant\u2019s desig\u00ad\nnated beneficiary, with designations and changes to be\nmade in a particular way. William\u2019s designation of Liv as\nhis beneficiary was made in the way required; Liv\u2019s waiver\nwas not.14\n                          IV\n  Although Liv\u2019s waiver was not rendered a nullity by the\nterms of \u00a71056, the plan administrator properly distrib\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 The  Estate does not contend that Liv\u2019s waiver was a valid dis\u00ad\nclaimer under the terms of the plan.

Argued October 7, 2008\u2014Decided January 26, 2009 \n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as\n  relevant here, obligates administrators to manage ERISA plans \u201cin\n  accordance with the documents and instruments governing\u201d them, 29\n  U. S. C. \u00a71104(a)(1)(D); requires covered pension benefit plans to\n  \u201cprovide that benefits . . . may not be assigned or alienated,\u201d\n  \u00a71056(d)(1); and exempts from this bar qualified domestic relations\n  orders (QDROs), \u00a71056(d)(3). The decedent, William Kennedy, par\n  ticipated in his employer\u2019s savings and investment plan (SIP), with\n  power both to designate a beneficiary to receive the funds upon his\n  death and to replace or revoke that designation as prescribed by the\n  plan administrator. Under the terms of the plan, if there is no sur\n  viving spouse or designated beneficiary at the time of death, distribu\n  tion is made as directed by the estate\u2019s executor or administrator.\n  Upon their marriage, William designated Liv Kennedy his SIP bene\n  ficiary and named no contingent beneficiary. Their subsequent di\n  vorce decree divested Liv of her interest in the SIP benefits, but Wil\n  liam did not execute a document removing Liv as the SIP beneficiary.\n  On William\u2019s death, petitioner Kari Kennedy, his daughter and the\n  executrix of his Estate, asked for the SIP funds to be distributed to\n  the Estate, but the plan administrator relied on William\u2019s designa\n  tion form and paid them to Liv. The Estate filed suit, alleging that\n  Liv had waived her SIP benefits in the divorce and thus respondents,\n  the employer and the SIP plan administrator (together, DuPont), had\n  violated ERISA by paying her. As relevant here, the District Court\n  entered summary judgment for the Estate, ordering DuPont to pay\n  the benefits to the Estate. The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that\n2     KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV. \n\n                   AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    Liv\u2019s waiver was an assignment or alienation of her interest to the\n    Estate barred by \u00a71056(d)(1).\nHeld:\n    1. Because Liv did not attempt to direct her interest in the SIP\n benefits to the Estate or any other potential beneficiary, her waiver\n did not constitute an assignment or alienation rendered void under\n \u00a71056(d)(1). Pp. 5\u201313.\n       (a) Given the legal meaning of \u201cassigned\u201d and \u201calienated,\u201d it is\n fair to say that Liv did not assign or alienate anything to William or\n to the Estate. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s broad reading\u2014that Liv\u2019s waiver\n indirectly transferred her interest to the next possible beneficiary,\n here the Estate\u2014is questionable. It would be odd to speak of an es\n tate as the transferee of its own decedent\u2019s property or of the dece\n dent in his lifetime as his own transferee. It would also be strange\n under the Treasury Regulation that defines \u201cassignment\u201d and \u201calien\n ation.\u201d Moreover, it is difficult to see how certain waivers not barred\n by the antialienation provision e.g., a surviving spouse\u2019s ability to\n waive a survivor\u2019s annuity or lump-sum payment, see Boggs v. Boggs,\n 520 U. S. 833, 843; 29 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71055(a), (b)(1)(C), (c)(2), would be\n permissible under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading. These doubts, and ex\n ceptions calling the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading into question, point the\n Court toward the law of trusts that \u201cserves as ERISA\u2019s backdrop.\u201d\n Beck v. PACE Int\u2019l Union, 551 U. S. 96, 101. Section 1056(d)(1) is\n much like a spendthrift trust provision barring assignment or alien\n ation of a benefit, see Boggs, supra, at 852, and the cognate trust law\n is highly suggestive here. The general principle that a designated\n spendthrift beneficiary can disclaim his trust interest magnifies the\n improbability that a statute written with an eye on the old law would\n effectively force a beneficiary to take an interest willy-nilly. The\n Treasury reads its own regulation to mean that the antialienation\n provision is not violated by a beneficiary\u2019s waiver \u201cwhere the benefi\n ciary does not attempt to direct her interest in pension benefits to\n another person.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18. Being\n neither \u201cplainly erroneous [n]or inconsistent with the regulation,\u201d the\n Treasury Department\u2019s interpretation is controlling. Auer v. Rob\n bins, 519 U. S. 452, 461.

Although Liv\u2019s waiver was not nullified by \u00a71056\u2019s express\n terms, the plan administrator did its ERISA duty by paying the SIP\n benefits to Liv in conformity with the plan documents. ERISA pro\n vides no exception to the plan administrator\u2019s duty to act in accor\n dance with plan documents. Thus, the Estate\u2019s claim stands or falls\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Egelhoff, 532 U. S.\n  141, 148. By giving a plan participant a clear set of instructions for\n  making his own instructions clear, ERISA forecloses any justification\n  for enquiries into expressions of intent, in favor of the virtues of ad\n  hering to an uncomplicated rule. Less certain rules could force plan\n  administrators to examine numerous external documents purporting\n  to be waivers and draw them into litigation like this over those waiv\n  ers\u2019 meaning and enforceability. The guarantee of simplicity is not\n  absolute, since a QDRO\u2019s enforceability may require an administra\n  tor to look for beneficiaries outside plan documents notwithstanding\n  \u00a71104(a)(1)(D). But an administrator enforcing a QDRO must be said\n  to enforce plan documents, not ignore them, and a QDRO enquiry is\n  relatively discrete, given its specific and objective criteria. These are\n  good and sufficient reasons for holding the line, just as the Court did\n  in holding that ERISA preempted state laws that could blur the\n  bright-line requirement to follow plan documents in distributing\n  benefits. See Boggs, supra, at 850, and Egelhoff, supra, at 143. What\n  goes for inconsistent state law goes for a federal common law of\n  waiver that might obscure a plan administrator\u2019s duty to act \u201cin ac\n  cordance with the documents and instruments.\u201d See Mertens v.

S. C. \u00a71001 et seq., generally\nobligates administrators to manage ERISA plans \u201cin\naccordance with the documents and instruments govern\u00ad\ning\u201d them. \u00a71104(a)(1)(D). At a more specific level, the\nAct requires covered pension benefit plans to \u201cprovide that\nbenefits . . . under the plan may not be assigned or alien\u00ad\nated,\u201d \u00a71056(d)(1), but this bar does not apply to qualified\ndomestic relations orders (QDROs), \u00a71056(d)(3). The\nquestion here is whether the terms of the limitation on\nassignment or alienation invalidated the act of a divorced\nspouse, the designated beneficiary under her ex-husband\u2019s\nERISA pension plan, who purported to waive her entitle\u00ad\nment by a federal common law waiver embodied in a\ndivorce decree that was not a QDRO. We hold that such a\nwaiver is not rendered invalid by the text of the antialien\u00ad\nation provision, but that the plan administrator properly\ndisregarded the waiver owing to its conflict with the des\u00ad\nignation made by the former husband in accordance with\n2    KENNEDY v.

William and\nLiv divorced in 1994, subject to a decree that Liv \u201cis . . .\ndivested of all right, title, interest, and claim in and to . . .\n[a]ny and all sums . . . the proceeds [from], and any other\nrights related to any . . . retirement plan, pension plan, or\nlike benefit program existing by reason of [William\u2019s] past\nor present or future employment.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n64\u201365. William did not, however, execute any documents\nremoving Liv as the SIP beneficiary, 497 F. 3d, at 428,\neven though he did execute a new beneficiary-designation\nform naming his daughter, Kari Kennedy, as the benefici\u00ad\nary under DuPont\u2019s Pension and Retirement Plan, also\ngoverned by ERISA.\n   On William\u2019s death in 2001, petitioner Kari Kennedy\nwas named executrix and asked DuPont to distribute the\nSIP funds to William\u2019s Estate. Ibid. DuPont, instead,\nrelied on William\u2019s designation form and paid the balance\nof some $400,000 to Liv. Ibid. The Estate then sued\nrespondents DuPont and the SIP plan administrator\n(together, DuPont), claiming that the divorce decree\namounted to a waiver of the SIP benefits on Liv\u2019s part,\nand that DuPont had violated ERISA by paying the bene\u00ad\nfits to William\u2019s designee.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Estate now says that William\u2019s beneficiary-designation form for\nthe Pension and Retirement Plan applied to the SIP as well, but the\nform on its face applies only to DuPont\u2019s \u201cPension and Retirement\nPlan.\u201d App. 62. In the District Court, in fact, the Estate stipulated\nthat William \u201cnever executed any forms or documents to remove or\nreplace Liv Kennedy as his sole beneficiary under either the SIP or [a\nplan that merged into the SIP].\u201d Id., at 28.

PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV. \n\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   So far as it matters here, the District Court entered\nsummary judgment for the Estate, to which it ordered\nDuPont to pay the value of the SIP benefits. The court\nrelied on Fifth Circuit precedent establishing that a bene\u00ad\nficiary can waive his rights to the proceeds of an ERISA\nplan \u201c \u2018provided that the waiver is explicit, voluntary, and\nmade in good faith.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 38 (quoting\nManning v. Hayes, 212 F. 3d 866, 874 (CA5 2000)).\n   The Fifth Circuit nonetheless reversed, distinguishing\nprior decisions enforcing federal common law waivers of\nERISA benefits because they involved life-insurance poli\u00ad\ncies, which are considered \u201c \u2018welfare plan[s]\u2019 \u201d under ERISA\nand consequently free of the antialienation provision. 497\nF. 3d, at 429. The Court of Appeals held that Liv\u2019s waiver\nconstituted an assignment or alienation of her interest in\nthe SIP benefits to the Estate, and so could not be hon\u00ad\nored. Id., at 430. The court relied heavily on the ERISA\nprovision for bypassing the antialienation provision when\na marriage breaks up: under 29 U. S. C. \u00a71056(d)(3),3 a\ncourt order that satisfies certain statutory requirements is\nknown as a qualified domestic relations order, which is\nexempt from the bar on assignment or alienation. Be\u00ad\ncause the Kennedys\u2019 divorce decree was not a QDRO, the\nFifth Circuit reasoned that it could not give effect to Liv\u2019s\nwaiver incorporated in it, given that \u201cERISA provides a\nspecific mechanism\u2014the QDRO\u2014for addressing the\nelimination of a spouse\u2019s interest in plan benefits, but that\nmechanism is not invoked.\u201d 497 F. 3d, at 431.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\naddress it in the first instance.

S. 638, 645\u2013646 (1992).\n  3 Section 1056(d)(3)(A) provides that the antialienation provision\n\n\u201cshall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any\nbenefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic\nrelations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is\ndetermined to be a qualified domestic relations order.\u201d\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

We subsequently realized that this case\nimplicates the further split over whether a beneficiary\u2019s\nfederal common law waiver of plan benefits is effective\nwhere that waiver is inconsistent with plan documents,5\nand after oral argument we invited supplemental briefing\non that latter issue, upon which the disposition of this case\nultimately turns.

The court found support in the applica\u00ad\nble Treasury Department regulation that defines \u201cassign\u00ad\nment\u201d and \u201calienation\u201d to include\n    \u201c[a]ny direct or indirect arrangement (whether revo\u00ad\n    cable or irrevocable) whereby a party acquires from a\n    participant or beneficiary a right or interest enforce\u00ad\n    able against the plan in, or to, all or any part of a plan\n    benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to\n    the participant or beneficiary.\u201d 26 CFR \u00a71.401(a)\u2013\n    13(c)(1)(ii) (2008).\nSee Boggs v. Boggs, 520 U. S. 833, 851\u2013852 (1997) (relying\nupon the regulation to interpret the meaning of \u201cassign\u00ad\nment\u201d and \u201calienation\u201d in \u00a71056(d)(1)).         The Circuit\ntreated Liv\u2019s waiver as an \u201c \u2018indirect arrangement\u2019 \u201d\nwhereby the Estate gained an \u201c \u2018interest enforceable\nagainst the plan.\u2019 \u201d 497 F. 3d, at 430.\n   Casting the alienation net this far, though, raises ques\u00ad\ntions that leave one in doubt. Although it is possible to\nspeak of the waiver as an \u201carrangement\u201d having the indi\u00ad\nrect effect of a transfer to the next possible beneficiary, it\nwould be odd usage to speak of an estate as the transferee\nof its own decedent\u2019s property, just as it would be to speak\nof the decedent in his lifetime as his own transferee. And\ntreating the estate or even the ultimate estate beneficiary\nas the assignee or transferee would be strange under the\nterms of the regulation: it would be hard to say the estate\nor future beneficiary \u201cacquires\u201d a right or interest when at\nthe time of the waiver there was no estate and the benefi\u00ad\nciary of a future estate might be anyone\u2019s guess. If there\nwere a contingent beneficiary (or the participant made a\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsubsequent designation) the estate would get no interest;\nas for an estate beneficiary, the identity could ultimately\nturn on the law of intestacy applied to facts as yet un\u00ad\nknown, or on the contents of the participant\u2019s subsequent\nwill, or simply on the participant\u2019s future exercise of (or\nfailure to invoke) the power to designate a new beneficiary\ndirectly under the terms of the plan. Thus, if such a\nwaiver created an \u201carrangement\u201d assigning or transferring\nanything under the statute, the assignor would be blind\u00ad\nfolded, operating, at best, on the fringe of what \u201cassign\u00ad\nment\u201d or \u201calienation\u201d normally suggests.\n   The questionability of this broad reading is confirmed by\nexceptions to it that are apparent right off the bat. Take\nthe case of a surviving spouse\u2019s interest in pension bene\u00ad\nfits, for example. Depending on the circumstances, a\nsurviving spouse has a right to a survivor\u2019s annuity or to a\nlump-sum payment on the death of the participant, unless\nthe spouse has waived the right and the participant has\neliminated the survivor annuity benefit or designated a\ndifferent beneficiary. See Boggs, supra, at 843; 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71055(a), (b)(1)(C), (c)(2). This waiver by a spouse is\nplainly not barred by the antialienation provision. Like\u00ad\nwise, DuPont concedes that a qualified disclaimer under\nthe Tax Code, which allows a party to refuse an interest in\nproperty and thereby eliminate federal tax, would not\nviolate the antialienation provision. See Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndents 21\u201323; 26 U. S. C. \u00a72518. In each example, though,\nwe fail to see how these waivers would be permis-\nsible under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading of the statute and\nregulation.\n   Our doubts, and the exceptions that call the Fifth Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s reading into question, point us toward authority we\nhave drawn on before, the law of trusts that \u201cserves as\nERISA\u2019s backdrop.\u201d Beck v. PACE Int\u2019l Union, 551 U. S.\n96, 101 (2007). We explained before that \u00a71056(d)(1) is\nmuch like a spendthrift trust provision barring assign\u00ad\n8    KENNEDY v.

Al\u00ad\nthough the beneficiary of a spendthrift trust traditionally\nlacked the means to transfer his beneficial interest to\nanyone else, he did have the power to disclaim prior to\naccepting it, so long as the disclaimer made no attempt to\ndirect the interest to a beneficiary in his stead.

In any event, our point\nis not that Liv\u2019s waiver was a valid disclaimer at common law: only that\nreading the terms of 29 U. S. C. \u00a71056(d)(1) to bar all non-QDRO\nwaivers is unsound in light of background common law principles.\n   7 It is true that the Government\u2019s position regarding the applicability\n\nof the antialienation provision to a waiver has fluctuated. The Labor\nDepartment previously took the position that \u201capplication of such a\nfederal common-law waiver rule to pension plans would conflict with\nERISA\u2019s anti-alienation provision.\u201d Brief for Secretary of Labor as\n10   KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV.\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Fifth Circuit found \u201csignificant support\u201d for its\ncontrary holding in the QDRO subsections, reasoning that\n\u201c[i]n the marital-dissolution context, the QDRO provisions\nsupply the sole exception to the anti-alienation provision,\u201d\n497 F. 3d, at 430, a point that echoes in DuPont\u2019s argu\u00ad\nment here. But the negative implication of the QDRO\nlanguage is not that simple. If a QDRO provided a way for\na former spouse like Liv merely to waive benefits, this\nwould be powerful evidence that the antialienation provi\u00ad\nsion was meant to deny any effect to a waiver within a\ndivorce decree but not a QDRO, else there would have\nbeen no need for the QDRO exception. But this is not so,\nand DuPont\u2019s argument rests on a false premise. In fact, a\nbeneficiary seeking only to relinquish her right to benefits\ncannot do this by a QDRO, for a QDRO by definition re\u00ad\nquires that it be the \u201ccreat[ion] or recogni[tion of] the\nexistence of an alternate payee\u2019s right to, or assign[ment]\nto an alternate payee [of] the right to, receive all or a\nportion of the benefits payable with respect to a partici\u00ad\npant under a plan.\u201d 29 U.

S., at\n462.\n   8 Even if one understands Liv\u2019s waiver to have resulted somehow in\n\nher interest reverting to William, he does not qualify as an \u201calternate\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmechanism for simply renouncing a claim to benefits,\nthen, the QDRO provisions shed no light on whether a\nbeneficiary may waive by a non-QDRO.\n  In sum, Liv did not attempt to direct her interest in the\nSIP benefits to the Estate or any other potential benefici\u00ad\nary, and accordingly we think that the better view is that\nher waiver did not constitute an assignment or alienation\nrendered void under the terms of \u00a71056(d)(1).\n                             B\n  DuPont has three other reasons for saying that Liv\u2019s\nwaiver was barred by ERISA. They are unavailing.\n  First, it argues that even if the waiver is not an assign\u00ad\nment or alienation barred under the terms of \u00a71056(d)(1),\n\u00a71056(d)(3)(A) still prohibits it, in providing that\n\u00a71056(d)(1) \u201cshall apply to the creation, assignment, or\nrecognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect\nto a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order\n[that is not a QDRO].\u201d At the very least, DuPont reasons,\nLiv\u2019s waiver included a \u201crecognition\u201d of William\u2019s rights\nwith respect to the SIP benefits. But DuPont overlooks\nthe point that when subsection (d)(3)(A) provides that the\nbar to assignments or alienations extends to non-QDRO\ndomestic relations orders, it does nothing to expand the\nscope of prohibited assignment and alienation under\nsubsection (d)(1). Whether Liv\u2019s action is seen as a\nwaiver or as a domestic relations order that incorpor\u00ad\nated a waiver, subsection (d)(1) does not cover it and\n\u00a71056(d)(3)(A) does not independently bar it.\n  Second, DuPont relies upon \u00a71056(d)(3)(H)(iii)(II), pro\u00ad\nviding that if a domestic relations order is not a QDRO,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npayee,\u201d which is defined by statute as \u201cany spouse, former spouse, child,\nor other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic\nrelations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the\nbenefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a71056(d)(3)(K).\n12   KENNEDY v. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR DUPONT SAV.\n                  AND INVESTMENT PLAN\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts\n(including any interest thereon) to the person or persons\nwho would have been entitled to such amounts if there\nhad been no order.\u201d According to DuPont, because the\ndivorce decree was not a QDRO this provision calls for\npaying benefits as if there had been no order. But DuPont\nhas wrenched this language out of its setting, reading\nclause (iii) of subparagraph (H) as if there were no clause\n(i):\n     \u201cDuring any period in which the issue of whether a\n     domestic relations order is a qualified domestic rela\u00ad\n     tions order is being determined . . . the plan adminis\u00ad\n     trator shall separately account for the amounts (here\u00ad\n     inafter in this subparagraph referred to as the\n     \u2018segregated amounts\u2019) which would have been payable\n     to the alternate payee during such period if the order\n     had been determined to be a qualified domestic rela\u00ad\n     tions order.\u201d \u00a71056(d)(3)(H)(i).\nThus it is clear that subparagraph (H) speaks of a domes\u00ad\ntic relations order that distributes certain benefits (the\n\u201csegregated amounts\u201d) to an alternate payee, when the\nquestion for the plan administrator is whether the order is\neffective as a QDRO. That is the circumstance in which,\nfor want of a QDRO, clause (iii) tells the plan administra\u00ad\ntor not to pay the alternate, but to distribute the segre\u00ad\ngated amounts as if there had been no order. Clause (iii)\ndoes not, as DuPont suggests, state a general rule that a\nnon-QDRO domestic relations order is a nullity in any\nproceeding that would affect the determination of a bene\u00ad\nficiary. And of course clause (iii) says nothing here at all;\nthe divorce decree names no alternate payee, and there\nare consequently no \u201csegregated amounts.\u201d\n   Third, DuPont claims that a plan cannot recognize a\nwaiver of benefits in a non-QDRO divorce decree because\nERISA preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nmay now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan,\u201d\nwith \u201cState law\u201d being defined to include \u201cdecisions\u201d or\n\u201cother State action having the effect of law.\u201d9 \u00a7\u00a71144(a),\n(c)(1). DuPont says that Liv\u2019s waiver, expressed in a state\u00ad\ncourt decision and related to an employee benefit plan, is\nthus preempted. But recognizing a waiver in a divorce\ndecree would not be giving effect to state law; the argu\u00ad\nment is that the waiver should be treated as a creature of\nfederal common law, in which case its setting in a state\ndivorce decree would be only happenstance. A court would\nmerely be applying federal law to a document that might\nalso have independent significance under state law. See,\ne.g., Melton v. Melton, 324 F. 3d 941, 945\u2013946 (CA7 2003);\nClift v. Clift, 210 F. 3d 268, 271\u2013272 (CA5 2000); Lyman\nLumber Co. v. Hill, 877 F. 2d 692, 693\u2013694 (CA8 1989).\n                            III\n  The waiver\u2019s escape from inevitable nullity under the\nexpress terms of the antialienation clause does not, how\u00ad\never, control the decision of this case, and the question\nremains whether the plan administrator was required to\nhonor Liv\u2019s waiver with the consequence of distributing\nthe SIP balance to the Estate.10 We hold that it was not,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 This preemption provision does not apply to QDROs.               See\n\u00a71144(b)(7).\n  10 Despite our following answer to the question here, our conclusion\n\nthat \u00a71056(d)(1) does not make a nullity of a waiver leaves open any\nquestions about a waiver\u2019s effect in circumstances in which it is consis\u00ad\ntent with plan documents. Nor do we express any view as to whether\nthe Estate could have brought an action in state or federal court\nagainst Liv to obtain the benefits after they were distributed. Compare\nBoggs v.

In any case, a\nQDRO enquiry is relatively discrete, given the specific and\nobjective criteria for a domestic relations order that quali\u00ad\nfies as a QDRO,12 see \u00a7\u00a71056(d)(3)(C), (D), requirements\nthat amount to a statutory checklist working to \u201cspare [an\nadministrator] from litigation-fomenting ambiguities,\u201d\nMetropolitan Life Ins.

This is a far cry from asking a plan adminis\u00ad\ntrator to figure out whether a claimed federal common law\nwaiver was knowing and voluntary, whether its language\naddressed the particular benefits at issue, and so forth, on\ninto factually complex and subjective determinations.

The plan provided a way to\ndisclaim an interest in the SIP account, but Liv did not\npurport to follow it.13 The plan administrator therefore\ndid exactly what \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) required: \u201cthe documents\ncontrol, and those name [the ex-wife].\u201d McMillan v.\nParrott, 913 F. 2d 310, 312 (CA6 1990).\n  It is no answer, as the Estate argues, that William\u2019s\nbeneficiary-designation form should not control because it\nis not one of the \u201cdocuments and instruments governing\nthe plan\u201d under \u00a71104(a)(1)(D) and was not treated as a\nplan document by the plan administrator. That is beside\nthe point. It is uncontested that the SIP and the summary\nplan description are \u201cdocuments and instruments govern\u00ad\ning the plan.\u201d See Curtiss-Wright Corp., 514 U.
