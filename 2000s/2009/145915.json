METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\n NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 06–1595. Argued October 8, 2008—Decided January 26, 2009\nIn response to questions from an official of respondent local government\n  (Metro) during an internal investigation into rumors of sexual har\n  assment by the Metro School District employee relations director\n  (Hughes), petitioner Crawford, a 30-year employee, reported that\n  Hughes had sexually harassed her. Metro took no action against\n  Hughes, but soon fired Crawford, alleging embezzlement. She filed\n  suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that\n  Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughes’s behavior, in violation\n  of 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a), which makes it unlawful “for an employer\n  to discriminate against any . . . employe[e]” who (1) “has opposed any\n  practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter”\n  (opposition clause), or (2) “has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n  participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hear\n  ing under this subchapter” (participation clause). The court granted\n  Metro summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding\n  that the opposition clause demanded “active, consistent” opposing ac\n  tivities, whereas Crawford had not initiated any complaint prior to\n  the investigation, and finding that the participation clause did not\n  cover Metro’s internal investigation because it was not conducted\n  pursuant to a Title VII charge pending with the Equal Employment\n  Opportunity Commission.\nHeld: The antiretaliation provision’s protection extends to an employee\n who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in\n answering questions during an employer’s internal investigation.\n Because “oppose” is undefined by statute, it carries its ordinary dic\n tionary meaning of resisting or contending against. Crawford’s\n statement is thus covered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly\n2         CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n               NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    disapproving account of Hughes’s sexually obnoxious behavior toward\n    her. “Oppose” goes beyond “active, consistent” behavior in ordinary\n    discourse, and may be used to speak of someone who has taken no ac\n    tion at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it. Thus, a person\n    can “oppose” by responding to someone else’s questions just as surely\n    as by provoking the discussion. Nothing in the statute requires a\n    freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on\n    her own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in\n    the same words when asked a question. Metro unconvincingly ar\n    gues for the Sixth Circuit’s active, consistent opposition rule, claim\n    ing that employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible\n    discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise when things go\n    badly for an employee who responded to enquiries. Employers, how\n    ever, have a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to dis\n    criminatory activity in their operations because Burlington Indus\n    tries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 765, and Faragher v. Boca Raton,\n    524 U. S. 775, 807, hold “[a]n employer . . . subject to vicarious liabil\n    ity to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment\n    created by a supervisor with . . . authority over the employee.” The\n    Circuit’s rule could undermine the Ellerth-Faragher scheme, along\n    with the statute’s “ ‘primary objective’ ” of “avoid[ing] harm” to em\n    ployees, Faragher, supra, at 806, for if an employee reporting dis\n    crimination in answer to an employer’s questions could be penalized\n    with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep\n    quiet about Title VII offenses. Because Crawford’s conduct is covered\n    by the opposition clause, this Court does not reach her argument that\n    the Sixth Circuit also misread the participation clause.

The\nquestion here is whether this protection extends to an\nemployee who speaks out about discrimination not on her\nown initiative, but in answering questions during an\nemployer’s internal investigation. We hold that it does.\n                           I\n  In 2002, respondent Metropolitan Government of                               Nash\nville and Davidson County, Tennessee (Metro),                                  began\nlooking into rumors of sexual harassment by the                                Metro\nSchool District’s employee relations director,                                  Gene\nHughes.1 211 Fed.

When\n\n——————\n  1 Because this case arises out of the District Court’s grant of sum\nmary judgment for Metro, “we are required to view all facts and draw\nall reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, [Crawford].”\nBrosseau v. Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam).\n2      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nVeronica Frazier, a Metro human resources officer, asked\npetitioner Vicky Crawford, a 30-year Metro employee,\nwhether she had witnessed “inappropriate behavior” on\nthe part of Hughes, id., at 374–375, Crawford described\nseveral instances of sexually harassing behavior: once,\nHughes had answered her greeting, “ ‘Hey Dr. Hughes,\nwhat’s up?,’ ” by grabbing his crotch and saying “ ‘[Y]ou\nknow what’s up’ ”; he had repeatedly “ ‘put his crotch up to\n[her] window’ ”; and on one occasion he had entered her\noffice and “ ‘grabbed her head and pulled it to his crotch,’ ”\nid., at 375, and n. 1. Two other employees also reported\nbeing sexually harassed by Hughes. Id., at 375. Although\nMetro took no action against Hughes, it did fire Crawford\nand the two other accusers soon after finishing the inves\ntigation, saying in Crawford’s case that it was for embez\nzlement. Ibid. Crawford claimed Metro was retaliating\nfor her report of Hughes’s behavior and filed a charge of a\nTitle VII violation with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC), followed by this suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of\nTennessee. Ibid.\n   The Title VII antiretaliation provision has two clauses,\nmaking it “an unlawful employment practice for an em\nployer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . [1]\nbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful\nemployment practice by this subchapter, or [2] because he\nhas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\nany manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\nunder this subchapter.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). The one\nis known as the “opposition clause,” the other as the “par\nticipation clause,” and Crawford accused Metro of violat\ning both.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nMetro. It held that Crawford could not satisfy the opposi\ntion clause because she had not “instigated or initiated\nany complaint,” but had “merely answered questions by\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninvestigators in an already-pending internal investigation,\ninitiated by someone else.” Memorandum Opinion, No.\n3:03–cv–00996 (MD Tenn., Jan. 6, 2005), App. C to Pet. for\nCert. 16a–17a. It concluded that her claim also failed\nunder the participation clause, which Sixth Circuit prece\ndent confined to protecting “ ‘an employee’s participation\nin an employer’s internal investigation . . . where that\ninvestigation occurs pursuant to a pending EEOC charge’ ”\n(not the case here). Id., at 15a (emphasis omitted) (quot\ning Abbott v. Crown Motor Co., 348 F. 3d 537, 543 (CA6\n2003)).\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the same grounds,\nholding that the opposition clause “ ‘demands active, con\nsistent “opposing” activities to warrant . . . protection\nagainst retaliation,’ ” 211 Fed. Appx., at 376 (quoting Bell\nv. Safety Grooving & Grinding, LP, 107 Fed. Appx. 607,\n610 (CA6 2004)), whereas Crawford did “not claim to have\ninstigated or initiated any complaint prior to her partici\npation in the investigation, nor did she take any further\naction following the investigation and prior to her firing.”\n211 Fed. Appx., at 376. Again like the trial judge, the\nCourt of Appeals understood that Crawford could show no\nviolation of the participation clause because her “ ‘em\nployer’s internal investigation’ ” was not conducted “ ‘pur\nsuant to a pending EEOC charge.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Abbott,\nsupra, at 543).\n  Because the Sixth Circuit’s decision conflicts with those\nof other Circuits, particularly as to the opposition clause,\nsee, e.g., McDonnell v. Cisneros, 84 F. 3d 256, 262 (CA7\n1996), we granted Crawford’s petition for certiorari. 552\nU. S. ___ (2008). We now reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n                          II\n  The opposition clause makes it “unlawful . . . for an\nemployer to discriminate against any . . . employe[e] . . .\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbecause he has opposed any practice made . . . unlawful\n. . . by this subchapter.” §2000e–3(a). The term “oppose,”\nbeing left undefined by the statute, carries its ordinary\nmeaning, Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979):\n“to resist or antagonize . . . ; to contend against; to con\nfront; resist; withstand,” Webster’s New International\nDictionary 1710 (2d ed. 1958). Although these actions\nentail varying expenditures of energy, “RESIST frequently\nimplies more active striving than OPPOSE.” Ibid.; see also\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 1359\n(2d ed. 1987) (defining “oppose” as “to be hostile or adverse\nto, as in opinion”).\n    The statement Crawford says she gave to Frazier is thus\ncovered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disap\nproving account of sexually obnoxious behavior toward her\nby a fellow employee, an answer she says antagonized her\nemployer to the point of sacking her on a false pretense.\nCrawford’s description of the louche goings-on would\ncertainly qualify in the minds of reasonable jurors as\n“resist[ant]” or “antagoni[stic]” to Hughes’s treatment, if\nfor no other reason than the point argued by the Govern\nment and explained by an EEOC guideline: “When an\nemployee communicates to her employer a belief that the\nemployer has engaged in . . . a form of employment dis\ncrimination, that communication” virtually always “consti\ntutes the employee’s opposition to the activity.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 9 (citing 2 EEOC Compli\nance Manual §§8–II–B(1), (2), p. 614:0003 (Mar. 2003));\nsee also Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 8) (explaining that EEOC compli\nance manuals “reflect ‘a body of experience and informed\njudgment to which courts and litigants may properly\nresort for guidance’ ” (quoting Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S.\n624, 642 (1998))). It is true that one can imagine excep\ntions, like an employee’s description of a supervisor’s\nracist joke as hilarious, but these will be eccentric cases,\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand this is not one of them.2\n   The Sixth Circuit thought answering questions fell short\nof opposition, taking the view that the clause “ ‘demands\nactive, consistent “opposing” activities to warrant . . .\nprotection against retaliation,’ ” 211 Fed. Appx., at 376\n(quoting Bell, supra, at 610), and that an employee must\n“instigat[e] or initiat[e]” a complaint to be covered, 211\nFed. Appx., at 376. But though these requirements obvi\nously exemplify opposition as commonly understood, they\nare not limits of it.\n   “Oppose” goes beyond “active, consistent” behavior in\nordinary discourse, where we would naturally use the\nword to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to\nadvance a position beyond disclosing it. Countless people\nwere known to “oppose” slavery before Emancipation, or\nare said to “oppose” capital punishment today, without\nwriting public letters, taking to the streets, or resisting\nthe government. And we would call it “opposition” if an\nemployee took a stand against an employer’s discrimina\ntory practices not by “instigating” action, but by standing\npat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor’s order to fire a\njunior worker for discriminatory reasons. Cf. McDonnell,\nsupra, at 262 (finding employee covered by Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 where his employer retaliated\nagainst him for failing to prevent his subordinate from\nfiling an EEOC charge). There is, then, no reason to doubt\nthat a person can “oppose” by responding to someone else’s\n\n——————\n   2 Metro suggests in passing that it was unclear whether Crawford\n\nactually opposed Hughes’s behavior because some of her defensive\nresponses were “inappropriate,” such as telling Hughes to “bite me” and\n“flip[ping] him a bird.” Brief for Respondent 1–2 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This argument fails not only because at the summary\njudgment stage we must “view all facts and draw all reasonable infer\nences in [Crawford’s] favor,” Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 195, n. 2, but also\nbecause Crawford gave no indication that Hughes’s gross clowning was\nanything but offensive to her.\n6      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nquestion just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and\nnothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting\nan employee who reports discrimination on her own initia\ntive but not one who reports the same discrimination in\nthe same words when her boss asks a question.\n   Metro and its amici support the Circuit panel’s insis\ntence on “active” and “consistent” opposition by arguing\nthat the lower the bar for retaliation claims, the less likely\nit is that employers will look into what may be happening\noutside the executive suite. As they see it, if retaliation\nis an easy charge when things go bad for an employee\nwho responded to enquiries, employers will avoid the\nheadache by refusing to raise questions about possible\ndiscrimination.\n   The argument is unconvincing, for we think it underes\ntimates the incentive to enquire that follows from our\ndecisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524\nU. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S.\n775 (1998). Ellerth and Faragher hold “[a]n employer . . .\nsubject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for\nan actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor\nwith . . . authority over the employee.” Ellerth, supra, at\n765; Faragher, supra, at 807. Although there is no af\nfirmative defense if the hostile environment “culminates\nin a tangible employment action” against the employee,\nEllerth, 524 U. S., at 765, an employer does have a defense\n“[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken” if it\n“exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly\nany” discriminatory conduct and “the plaintiff employee\nunreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or\ncorrective opportunities provided by the employer or to\navoid harm otherwise,” ibid. Employers are thus subject\nto a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to any\ndiscriminatory activity in their operations as a way to\nbreak the circuit of imputed liability. Ibid.; see also Brief\nfor Petitioner 24–28, and nn. 31–35 (citing studies demon\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrating that Ellerth and Faragher have prompted many\nemployers to adopt or strengthen procedures for investi\ngating, preventing, and correcting discriminatory con\nduct). The possibility that an employer might someday\nwant to fire someone who might charge discrimination\ntraceable to an internal investigation does not strike us as\nlikely to diminish the attraction of an Ellerth-Faragher\naffirmative defense.\n   That aside, we find it hard to see why the Sixth Circuit’s\nrule would not itself largely undermine the Ellerth-\nFaragher scheme, along with the statute’s “ ‘primary objec\ntive’ ” of “avoid[ing] harm” to employees. Faragher, supra,\nat 806 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S.\n405, 417 (1975)). If it were clear law that an employee\nwho reported discrimination in answering an employer’s\nquestions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent\nemployees would have a good reason to keep quiet about\nTitle VII offenses against themselves or against others.\nThis is no imaginary horrible given the documented indi\ncations that “[f]ear of retaliation is the leading reason why\npeople stay silent instead of voicing their concerns about\nbias and discrimination.” Brake, Retaliation, 90 Minn.\nL. Rev. 18, 20 (2005); see also id., at 37, and n. 58 (compil\ning studies). The appeals court’s rule would thus create a\nreal dilemma for any knowledgeable employee in a hostile\nwork environment if the boss took steps to assure a de\nfense under our cases. If the employee reported discrimi\nnation in response to the enquiries, the employer might\nwell be free to penalize her for speaking up. But if she\nkept quiet about the discrimination and later filed a Title\nVII claim, the employer might well escape liability, argu\ning that it “exercised reasonable care to prevent and cor\nrect [any discrimination] promptly” but “the plaintiff\nemployee unreasonably failed to take advantage of . . .\npreventive or corrective opportunities provided by the\nemployer.” Ellerth, supra, at 765. Nothing in the statute’s\n8       CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n             NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntext or our precedent supports this catch-22.3\n   Because Crawford’s conduct is covered by the opposition\nclause, we do not reach her argument that the Sixth Cir\ncuit misread the participation clause as well. But that\ndoes not mean the end of this case, for Metro’s motion for\nsummary judgment raised several defenses to the retalia\ntion charge besides the scope of the two clauses; the Dis\ntrict Court never reached these others owing to its ruling\non the elements of retaliation, and they remain open on\nremand.\n                            III\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n——————\n  3 Metro also argues that “[r]equiring the employee to actually initiate\n\na complaint . . . conforms with the employee’s ‘obligation of reasonable\ncare to avoid harm’ articulated in Faragher and Ellerth.” Brief for\nRespondent 28 (quoting Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807\n(1998)). But that mitigation requirement only applies to employees\nwho are suffering discrimination and have the opportunity to fix it by\n“tak[ing] advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities\nprovided by the employer,” ibid.; it is based on the general principle\n“that a victim has a duty ‘to use such means as are reasonable under\nthe circumstances to avoid or minimize . . . damages,’ ” id., at 806\n(quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982)). We\nhave never suggested that employees have a legal obligation to report\ndiscrimination against others to their employer on their own initiative,\nlet alone lose statutory protection by failing to speak. Extending the\nmitigation requirement so far would make no sense; employees will\noften face retaliation not for opposing discrimination they themselves\nface, but for reporting discrimination suffered by others. Thus, they are\nnot “victims” of anything until they are retaliated against, and it would\nbe absurd to require them to “mitigate” damages they may be unaware\nthey will suffer.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

I also\nagree with the Court’s primary reasoning, which is based\non “the point argued by the Government and explained by\nan EEOC guideline: ‘When an employee communicates to\nher employer a belief that the employer has engaged in . . .\na form of employment discrimination, that communication’\nvirtually always ‘constitutes the employee’s opposition to\nthe activity.’ ” Ante, at 4. I write separately to emphasize\nmy understanding that the Court’s holding does not\nand should not extend beyond employees who testify in\ninternal investigations or engage in analogous purposive\nconduct.\n  As the Court concludes, the term “oppose” does not\ndenote conduct that necessarily rises to the level required\nby the Sixth Circuit—i.e., conduct that is “ ‘consistent’ ”\nand “instigated or initiated” by the employee. 211 Fed.\n2      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n              ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\nAppx. 373, 376 (2006). The primary definitions of the\nterm “oppose” do, however, require conduct that is active\nand purposive. See Webster’s New International Diction\nary 1709–1710 (2d ed. 1953); Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1010 (1966) (hereinafter Random\nDict.); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 866–867 (2d ed.\n1989). For example, the first three definitions of the term\nin the dictionary upon which the Court principally relies\nare as follows:\n    “1. to act against or provide resistance to; combat. 2.\n    to stand in the way of; hinder; obstruct. 3. to set as an\n    opponent or adversary.” Random Dict. 1359 (2d ed.\n    1987).\nIn accordance with these definitions, petitioner contends\nthat the statutory term “oppose” means “taking action\n(including making a statement) to end, prevent, redress,\nor correct unlawful discrimination.” Brief for Petitioner\n40.\n   In order to decide the question that is before us, we have\nno need to adopt a definition of the term “oppose” that is\nbroader than the definition that petitioner advances. But\nin dicta, the Court notes that the fourth listed definition in\nthe Random House Dictionary of the English Language\ngoes further, defining “oppose” to mean “ ‘to be hostile or\nadverse to, as in opinion.’ ” Ante, at 4 (emphasis added).\nThus, this definition embraces silent opposition.\n   While this is certainly an accepted usage of the term\n“oppose,” the term is not always used in this sense, and it\nis questionable whether silent opposition is covered by the\nopposition clause of 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). It is notewor\nthy that all of the other conduct protected by this provi\nsion—making a charge, testifying, or assisting or partici\npating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing—\nrequires active and purposive conduct. “ ‘That several\nitems in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpreting the other items as possessing that attribute\nas well.’ ” S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental\nProtection, 547 U. S. 370, 378 (2006) (quoting Beecham v.\nUnited States, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994)).\n   An interpretation of the opposition clause that protects\nconduct that is not active and purposive would have im\nportant practical implications. It would open the door to\nretaliation claims by employees who never expressed a\nword of opposition to their employers. To be sure, in many\ncases, such employees would not be able to show that\nmanagement was aware of their opposition and thus\nwould not be able to show that their opposition caused the\nadverse actions at issue. But in other cases, such employ\nees might well be able to create a genuine factual issue on\nthe question of causation. Suppose, for example, that an\nemployee alleges that he or she expressed opposition while\ninformally chatting with a co-worker at the proverbial\nwater cooler or in a workplace telephone conversation that\nwas overheard by a co-worker. Or suppose that an em\nployee alleges that such a conversation occurred after\nwork at a restaurant or tavern frequented by co-workers\nor at a neighborhood picnic attended by a friend or relative\nof a supervisor.\n   Some courts hold that an employee asserting a retalia\ntion claim can prove causation simply by showing that the\nadverse employment action occurred within a short time\nafter the protected conduct. See, e.g., Clark County School\nDist. v. Breeden, 532 U. S. 268, 273 (2001) (per curiam)\n(noting that some cases “accept mere temporal proximity\nbetween an employer’s knowledge of protected activity and\nan adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of\ncausality to establish a prima facie case”); see also\nGorman-Bakos v. Cornell Cooperative Extension of\nSchenectady Cty., 252 F. 3d 545, 554 (CA2 2001); Conner\nv. Schnuk Markets, Inc., 121 F. 3d 1390, 1395 (CA10\n1997); Dey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., 28 F. 3d 1446, 1458\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n             ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n(CA7 1994). As a result, an employee claiming retaliation\nmay be able to establish causation simply by showing that,\nwithin some time period prior to the adverse action, the\nemployer, by some indirect means, became aware of the\nviews that the employee had expressed. Where the pro\ntected conduct consisted of a private conversation, applica\ntion of this rule would be especially problematic because of\nuncertainty regarding the point in time when the em\nployer became aware of the employee’s private expressions\nof disapproval.\n   The number of retaliation claims filed with the EEOC\nhas proliferated in recent years. See U. S. Equal Em\nployment Opportunity Commission, Charge Statistics:\nFY 1997 Through FY 2007, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/\ncharges.html; Charge Statistics: FY 1992 Through FY\n1996, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/charges-a.html (as visited\nJan. 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file)\n(showing that retaliation charges filed with the EEOC\ndoubled between 1992 and 2007). An expansive interpre\ntation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause\nthis trend to accelerate.\n   The question whether the opposition clause shields\nemployees who do not communicate their views to their\nemployers through purposive conduct is not before us in\nthis case; the answer to that question is far from clear;\nand I do not understand the Court’s holding to reach that\nissue here. For present purposes, it is enough to hold that\nthe opposition clause does protect an employee, like peti\ntioner, who testifies about unlawful conduct in an internal\ninvestigation.\n</pre>", "id": 145915, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/01/26/Crawford_v._Metropolitan_Government_of_Nashville_and_Davidson_Cty..pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\n NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 06–1595. Argued October 8, 2008—Decided January 26, 2009\nIn response to questions from an official of respondent local government\n  (Metro) during an internal investigation into rumors of sexual har\n  assment by the Metro School District employee relations director\n  (Hughes), petitioner Crawford, a 30-year employee, reported that\n  Hughes had sexually harassed her. Metro took no action against\n  Hughes, but soon fired Crawford, alleging embezzlement. She filed\n  suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that\n  Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughes’s behavior, in violation\n  of 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a), which makes it unlawful “for an employer\n  to discriminate against any . . . employe[e]” who (1) “has opposed any\n  practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter”\n  (opposition clause), or (2) “has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n  participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hear\n  ing under this subchapter” (participation clause). The court granted\n  Metro summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding\n  that the opposition clause demanded “active, consistent” opposing ac\n  tivities, whereas Crawford had not initiated any complaint prior to\n  the investigation, and finding that the participation clause did not\n  cover Metro’s internal investigation because it was not conducted\n  pursuant to a Title VII charge pending with the Equal Employment\n  Opportunity Commission.\nHeld: The antiretaliation provision’s protection extends to an employee\n who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in\n answering questions during an employer’s internal investigation.\n Because “oppose” is undefined by statute, it carries its ordinary dic\n tionary meaning of resisting or contending against. Crawford’s\n statement is thus covered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly\n2         CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n               NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    disapproving account of Hughes’s sexually obnoxious behavior toward\n    her. “Oppose” goes beyond “active, consistent” behavior in ordinary\n    discourse, and may be used to speak of someone who has taken no ac\n    tion at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it. Thus, a person\n    can “oppose” by responding to someone else’s questions just as surely\n    as by provoking the discussion. Nothing in the statute requires a\n    freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on\n    her own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in\n    the same words when asked a question. Metro unconvincingly ar\n    gues for the Sixth Circuit’s active, consistent opposition rule, claim\n    ing that employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible\n    discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise when things go\n    badly for an employee who responded to enquiries. Employers, how\n    ever, have a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to dis\n    criminatory activity in their operations because Burlington Indus\n    tries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 765, and Faragher v. Boca Raton,\n    524 U. S. 775, 807, hold “[a]n employer . . . subject to vicarious liabil\n    ity to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment\n    created by a supervisor with . . . authority over the employee.” The\n    Circuit’s rule could undermine the Ellerth-Faragher scheme, along\n    with the statute’s “ ‘primary objective’ ” of “avoid[ing] harm” to em\n    ployees, Faragher, supra, at 806, for if an employee reporting dis\n    crimination in answer to an employer’s questions could be penalized\n    with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep\n    quiet about Title VII offenses. Because Crawford’s conduct is covered\n    by the opposition clause, this Court does not reach her argument that\n    the Sixth Circuit also misread the participation clause.

Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam).\n2      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nVeronica Frazier, a Metro human resources officer, asked\npetitioner Vicky Crawford, a 30-year Metro employee,\nwhether she had witnessed “inappropriate behavior” on\nthe part of Hughes, id., at 374–375, Crawford described\nseveral instances of sexually harassing behavior: once,\nHughes had answered her greeting, “ ‘Hey Dr. Hughes,\nwhat’s up?,’ ” by grabbing his crotch and saying “ ‘[Y]ou\nknow what’s up’ ”; he had repeatedly “ ‘put his crotch up to\n[her] window’ ”; and on one occasion he had entered her\noffice and “ ‘grabbed her head and pulled it to his crotch,’ ”\nid., at 375, and n. 1. Two other employees also reported\nbeing sexually harassed by Hughes. Id., at 375. Although\nMetro took no action against Hughes, it did fire Crawford\nand the two other accusers soon after finishing the inves\ntigation, saying in Crawford’s case that it was for embez\nzlement. Ibid. Crawford claimed Metro was retaliating\nfor her report of Hughes’s behavior and filed a charge of a\nTitle VII violation with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC), followed by this suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of\nTennessee. Ibid.\n   The Title VII antiretaliation provision has two clauses,\nmaking it “an unlawful employment practice for an em\nployer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . [1]\nbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful\nemployment practice by this subchapter, or [2] because he\nhas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\nany manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\nunder this subchapter.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). The one\nis known as the “opposition clause,” the other as the “par\nticipation clause,” and Crawford accused Metro of violat\ning both.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nMetro. It held that Crawford could not satisfy the opposi\ntion clause because she had not “instigated or initiated\nany complaint,” but had “merely answered questions by\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninvestigators in an already-pending internal investigation,\ninitiated by someone else.” Memorandum Opinion, No.\n3:03–cv–00996 (MD Tenn., Jan. 6, 2005), App. C to Pet. for\nCert. 16a–17a. It concluded that her claim also failed\nunder the participation clause, which Sixth Circuit prece\ndent confined to protecting “ ‘an employee’s participation\nin an employer’s internal investigation . . . where that\ninvestigation occurs pursuant to a pending EEOC charge’ ”\n(not the case here). Id., at 15a (emphasis omitted) (quot\ning Abbott v. Crown Motor Co., 348 F. 3d 537, 543 (CA6\n2003)).\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the same grounds,\nholding that the opposition clause “ ‘demands active, con\nsistent “opposing” activities to warrant . . . protection\nagainst retaliation,’ ” 211 Fed. Appx., at 376 (quoting Bell\nv. Safety Grooving & Grinding, LP, 107 Fed. Appx. 607,\n610 (CA6 2004)), whereas Crawford did “not claim to have\ninstigated or initiated any complaint prior to her partici\npation in the investigation, nor did she take any further\naction following the investigation and prior to her firing.”\n211 Fed. Appx., at 376. Again like the trial judge, the\nCourt of Appeals understood that Crawford could show no\nviolation of the participation clause because her “ ‘em\nployer’s internal investigation’ ” was not conducted “ ‘pur\nsuant to a pending EEOC charge.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Abbott,\nsupra, at 543).\n  Because the Sixth Circuit’s decision conflicts with those\nof other Circuits, particularly as to the opposition clause,\nsee, e.g., McDonnell v. Cisneros, 84 F. 3d 256, 262 (CA7\n1996), we granted Crawford’s petition for certiorari. 552\nU. S. ___ (2008). We now reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n                          II\n  The opposition clause makes it “unlawful . . . for an\nemployer to discriminate against any . . . employe[e] . . .\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbecause he has opposed any practice made . . . unlawful\n. . . by this subchapter.” §2000e–3(a). The term “oppose,”\nbeing left undefined by the statute, carries its ordinary\nmeaning, Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979):\n“to resist or antagonize . . . ; to contend against; to con\nfront; resist; withstand,” Webster’s New International\nDictionary 1710 (2d ed. 1958). Although these actions\nentail varying expenditures of energy, “RESIST frequently\nimplies more active striving than OPPOSE.” Ibid.; see also\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 1359\n(2d ed. 1987) (defining “oppose” as “to be hostile or adverse\nto, as in opinion”).\n    The statement Crawford says she gave to Frazier is thus\ncovered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disap\nproving account of sexually obnoxious behavior toward her\nby a fellow employee, an answer she says antagonized her\nemployer to the point of sacking her on a false pretense.\nCrawford’s description of the louche goings-on would\ncertainly qualify in the minds of reasonable jurors as\n“resist[ant]” or “antagoni[stic]” to Hughes’s treatment, if\nfor no other reason than the point argued by the Govern\nment and explained by an EEOC guideline: “When an\nemployee communicates to her employer a belief that the\nemployer has engaged in . . . a form of employment dis\ncrimination, that communication” virtually always “consti\ntutes the employee’s opposition to the activity.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 9 (citing 2 EEOC Compli\nance Manual §§8–II–B(1), (2), p. 614:0003 (Mar. 2003));\nsee also Federal Express Corp. v.

Abbott, 524 U. S.\n624, 642 (1998))). It is true that one can imagine excep\ntions, like an employee’s description of a supervisor’s\nracist joke as hilarious, but these will be eccentric cases,\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand this is not one of them.2\n   The Sixth Circuit thought answering questions fell short\nof opposition, taking the view that the clause “ ‘demands\nactive, consistent “opposing” activities to warrant . . .\nprotection against retaliation,’ ” 211 Fed. Appx., at 376\n(quoting Bell, supra, at 610), and that an employee must\n“instigat[e] or initiat[e]” a complaint to be covered, 211\nFed. Appx., at 376. But though these requirements obvi\nously exemplify opposition as commonly understood, they\nare not limits of it.\n   “Oppose” goes beyond “active, consistent” behavior in\nordinary discourse, where we would naturally use the\nword to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to\nadvance a position beyond disclosing it. Countless people\nwere known to “oppose” slavery before Emancipation, or\nare said to “oppose” capital punishment today, without\nwriting public letters, taking to the streets, or resisting\nthe government. And we would call it “opposition” if an\nemployee took a stand against an employer’s discrimina\ntory practices not by “instigating” action, but by standing\npat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor’s order to fire a\njunior worker for discriminatory reasons. Cf. McDonnell,\nsupra, at 262 (finding employee covered by Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 where his employer retaliated\nagainst him for failing to prevent his subordinate from\nfiling an EEOC charge). There is, then, no reason to doubt\nthat a person can “oppose” by responding to someone else’s\n\n——————\n   2 Metro suggests in passing that it was unclear whether Crawford\n\nactually opposed Hughes’s behavior because some of her defensive\nresponses were “inappropriate,” such as telling Hughes to “bite me” and\n“flip[ping] him a bird.” Brief for Respondent 1–2 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This argument fails not only because at the summary\njudgment stage we must “view all facts and draw all reasonable infer\nences in [Crawford’s] favor,” Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 195, n. 2, but also\nbecause Crawford gave no indication that Hughes’s gross clowning was\nanything but offensive to her.\n6      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nquestion just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and\nnothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting\nan employee who reports discrimination on her own initia\ntive but not one who reports the same discrimination in\nthe same words when her boss asks a question.\n   Metro and its amici support the Circuit panel’s insis\ntence on “active” and “consistent” opposition by arguing\nthat the lower the bar for retaliation claims, the less likely\nit is that employers will look into what may be happening\noutside the executive suite. As they see it, if retaliation\nis an easy charge when things go bad for an employee\nwho responded to enquiries, employers will avoid the\nheadache by refusing to raise questions about possible\ndiscrimination.\n   The argument is unconvincing, for we think it underes\ntimates the incentive to enquire that follows from our\ndecisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524\nU. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S.\n775 (1998). Ellerth and Faragher hold “[a]n employer . . .\nsubject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for\nan actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor\nwith . . . authority over the employee.” Ellerth, supra, at\n765; Faragher, supra, at 807. Although there is no af\nfirmative defense if the hostile environment “culminates\nin a tangible employment action” against the employee,\nEllerth, 524 U. S., at 765, an employer does have a defense\n“[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken” if it\n“exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly\nany” discriminatory conduct and “the plaintiff employee\nunreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or\ncorrective opportunities provided by the employer or to\navoid harm otherwise,” ibid. Employers are thus subject\nto a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to any\ndiscriminatory activity in their operations as a way to\nbreak the circuit of imputed liability.

The possibility that an employer might someday\nwant to fire someone who might charge discrimination\ntraceable to an internal investigation does not strike us as\nlikely to diminish the attraction of an Ellerth-Faragher\naffirmative defense.\n   That aside, we find it hard to see why the Sixth Circuit’s\nrule would not itself largely undermine the Ellerth-\nFaragher scheme, along with the statute’s “ ‘primary objec\ntive’ ” of “avoid[ing] harm” to employees. Faragher, supra,\nat 806 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S.\n405, 417 (1975)). If it were clear law that an employee\nwho reported discrimination in answering an employer’s\nquestions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent\nemployees would have a good reason to keep quiet about\nTitle VII offenses against themselves or against others.\nThis is no imaginary horrible given the documented indi\ncations that “[f]ear of retaliation is the leading reason why\npeople stay silent instead of voicing their concerns about\nbias and discrimination.” Brake, Retaliation, 90 Minn.\nL. Rev. 18, 20 (2005); see also id., at 37, and n. 58 (compil\ning studies). The appeals court’s rule would thus create a\nreal dilemma for any knowledgeable employee in a hostile\nwork environment if the boss took steps to assure a de\nfense under our cases. If the employee reported discrimi\nnation in response to the enquiries, the employer might\nwell be free to penalize her for speaking up. But if she\nkept quiet about the discrimination and later filed a Title\nVII claim, the employer might well escape liability, argu\ning that it “exercised reasonable care to prevent and cor\nrect [any discrimination] promptly” but “the plaintiff\nemployee unreasonably failed to take advantage of . . .\npreventive or corrective opportunities provided by the\nemployer.” Ellerth, supra, at 765.

But that\ndoes not mean the end of this case, for Metro’s motion for\nsummary judgment raised several defenses to the retalia\ntion charge besides the scope of the two clauses; the Dis\ntrict Court never reached these others owing to its ruling\non the elements of retaliation, and they remain open on\nremand.\n                            III\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n——————\n  3 Metro also argues that “[r]equiring the employee to actually initiate\n\na complaint . . . conforms with the employee’s ‘obligation of reasonable\ncare to avoid harm’ articulated in Faragher and Ellerth.” Brief for\nRespondent 28 (quoting Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807\n(1998)). But that mitigation requirement only applies to employees\nwho are suffering discrimination and have the opportunity to fix it by\n“tak[ing] advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities\nprovided by the employer,” ibid.; it is based on the general principle\n“that a victim has a duty ‘to use such means as are reasonable under\nthe circumstances to avoid or minimize . . . damages,’ ” id., at 806\n(quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982)). We\nhave never suggested that employees have a legal obligation to report\ndiscrimination against others to their employer on their own initiative,\nlet alone lose statutory protection by failing to speak. Extending the\nmitigation requirement so far would make no sense; employees will\noften face retaliation not for opposing discrimination they themselves\nface, but for reporting discrimination suffered by others. Thus, they are\nnot “victims” of anything until they are retaliated against, and it would\nbe absurd to require them to “mitigate” damages they may be unaware\nthey will suffer.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

CRAWFORD, PETITIONER v. METRO-\n\n      POLITAN GOVERNMENT OF NASHVILLE \n\n       AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                       [January 26, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in the judgment.\n  The question in this case is whether Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42\nU. S. C. §2000e et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), prohibits\nretaliation against an employee who testifies in an inter\nnal investigation of alleged sexual harassment. I agree\nwith the Court that the “opposition clause” of §2000e–3(a)\n(2000 ed.) prohibits retaliation for such conduct. I also\nagree with the Court’s primary reasoning, which is based\non “the point argued by the Government and explained by\nan EEOC guideline: ‘When an employee communicates to\nher employer a belief that the employer has engaged in . . .\na form of employment discrimination, that communication’\nvirtually always ‘constitutes the employee’s opposition to\nthe activity.’ ” Ante, at 4. I write separately to emphasize\nmy understanding that the Court’s holding does not\nand should not extend beyond employees who testify in\ninternal investigations or engage in analogous purposive\nconduct.\n  As the Court concludes, the term “oppose” does not\ndenote conduct that necessarily rises to the level required\nby the Sixth Circuit—i.e., conduct that is “ ‘consistent’ ”\nand “instigated or initiated” by the employee. 211 Fed.\n2      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n              ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\nAppx. 373, 376 (2006). The primary definitions of the\nterm “oppose” do, however, require conduct that is active\nand purposive. See Webster’s New International Diction\nary 1709–1710 (2d ed. 1953); Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1010 (1966) (hereinafter Random\nDict.); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 866–867 (2d ed.\n1989). For example, the first three definitions of the term\nin the dictionary upon which the Court principally relies\nare as follows:\n    “1. to act against or provide resistance to; combat. 2.\n    to stand in the way of; hinder; obstruct. 3. to set as an\n    opponent or adversary.” Random Dict. 1359 (2d ed.\n    1987).\nIn accordance with these definitions, petitioner contends\nthat the statutory term “oppose” means “taking action\n(including making a statement) to end, prevent, redress,\nor correct unlawful discrimination.” Brief for Petitioner\n40.\n   In order to decide the question that is before us, we have\nno need to adopt a definition of the term “oppose” that is\nbroader than the definition that petitioner advances. But\nin dicta, the Court notes that the fourth listed definition in\nthe Random House Dictionary of the English Language\ngoes further, defining “oppose” to mean “ ‘to be hostile or\nadverse to, as in opinion.’ ” Ante, at 4 (emphasis added).\nThus, this definition embraces silent opposition.\n   While this is certainly an accepted usage of the term\n“oppose,” the term is not always used in this sense, and it\nis questionable whether silent opposition is covered by the\nopposition clause of 42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a). It is notewor\nthy that all of the other conduct protected by this provi\nsion—making a charge, testifying, or assisting or partici\npating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing—\nrequires active and purposive conduct. “ ‘That several\nitems in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpreting the other items as possessing that attribute\nas well.’ ” S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental\nProtection, 547 U. S. 370, 378 (2006) (quoting Beecham v.\nUnited States, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994)).\n   An interpretation of the opposition clause that protects\nconduct that is not active and purposive would have im\nportant practical implications. It would open the door to\nretaliation claims by employees who never expressed a\nword of opposition to their employers. To be sure, in many\ncases, such employees would not be able to show that\nmanagement was aware of their opposition and thus\nwould not be able to show that their opposition caused the\nadverse actions at issue. But in other cases, such employ\nees might well be able to create a genuine factual issue on\nthe question of causation. Suppose, for example, that an\nemployee alleges that he or she expressed opposition while\ninformally chatting with a co-worker at the proverbial\nwater cooler or in a workplace telephone conversation that\nwas overheard by a co-worker. Or suppose that an em\nployee alleges that such a conversation occurred after\nwork at a restaurant or tavern frequented by co-workers\nor at a neighborhood picnic attended by a friend or relative\nof a supervisor.\n   Some courts hold that an employee asserting a retalia\ntion claim can prove causation simply by showing that the\nadverse employment action occurred within a short time\nafter the protected conduct. See, e.g., Clark County School\nDist. v. Breeden, 532 U. S. 268, 273 (2001) (per curiam)\n(noting that some cases “accept mere temporal proximity\nbetween an employer’s knowledge of protected activity and\nan adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of\ncausality to establish a prima facie case”); see also\nGorman-Bakos v. Cornell Cooperative Extension of\nSchenectady Cty., 252 F. 3d 545, 554 (CA2 2001); Conner\nv. Schnuk Markets, Inc., 121 F. 3d 1390, 1395 (CA10\n1997); Dey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., 28 F. 3d 1446, 1458\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n             ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n(CA7 1994). As a result, an employee claiming retaliation\nmay be able to establish causation simply by showing that,\nwithin some time period prior to the adverse action, the\nemployer, by some indirect means, became aware of the\nviews that the employee had expressed. Where the pro\ntected conduct consisted of a private conversation, applica\ntion of this rule would be especially problematic because of\nuncertainty regarding the point in time when the em\nployer became aware of the employee’s private expressions\nof disapproval.\n   The number of retaliation claims filed with the EEOC\nhas proliferated in recent years. See U. S. Equal Em\nployment Opportunity Commission, Charge Statistics:\nFY 1997 Through FY 2007, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/\ncharges.html; Charge Statistics: FY 1992 Through FY\n1996, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/charges-a.html (as visited\nJan. 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file)\n(showing that retaliation charges filed with the EEOC\ndoubled between 1992 and 2007). An expansive interpre\ntation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause\nthis trend to accelerate.\n   The question whether the opposition clause shields\nemployees who do not communicate their views to their\nemployers through purposive conduct is not before us in\nthis case; the answer to that question is far from clear;\nand I do not understand the Court’s holding to reach that\nissue here. For present purposes, it is enough to hold that\nthe opposition clause does protect an employee, like peti\ntioner, who testifies about unlawful conduct in an internal\ninvestigation.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145915/", "sha1": "d446ad581288c2118aa34b2073a0a76a5cbfc8a6", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-016", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:29"}
