METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF\n NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 06\u20131595. Argued October 8, 2008\u2014Decided January 26, 2009\nIn response to questions from an official of respondent local government\n  (Metro) during an internal investigation into rumors of sexual har\n  assment by the Metro School District employee relations director\n  (Hughes), petitioner Crawford, a 30-year employee, reported that\n  Hughes had sexually harassed her. Metro took no action against\n  Hughes, but soon fired Crawford, alleging embezzlement. She filed\n  suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that\n  Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughes\u2019s behavior, in violation\n  of 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a), which makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer\n  to discriminate against any . . . employe[e]\u201d who (1) \u201chas opposed any\n  practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter\u201d\n  (opposition clause), or (2) \u201chas made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n  participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hear\n  ing under this subchapter\u201d (participation clause). The court granted\n  Metro summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding\n  that the opposition clause demanded \u201cactive, consistent\u201d opposing ac\n  tivities, whereas Crawford had not initiated any complaint prior to\n  the investigation, and finding that the participation clause did not\n  cover Metro\u2019s internal investigation because it was not conducted\n  pursuant to a Title VII charge pending with the Equal Employment\n  Opportunity Commission.\nHeld: The antiretaliation provision\u2019s protection extends to an employee\n who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in\n answering questions during an employer\u2019s internal investigation.\n Because \u201coppose\u201d is undefined by statute, it carries its ordinary dic\n tionary meaning of resisting or contending against. Crawford\u2019s\n statement is thus covered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly\n2         CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n               NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    disapproving account of Hughes\u2019s sexually obnoxious behavior toward\n    her. \u201cOppose\u201d goes beyond \u201cactive, consistent\u201d behavior in ordinary\n    discourse, and may be used to speak of someone who has taken no ac\n    tion at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it. Thus, a person\n    can \u201coppose\u201d by responding to someone else\u2019s questions just as surely\n    as by provoking the discussion. Nothing in the statute requires a\n    freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on\n    her own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in\n    the same words when asked a question. Metro unconvincingly ar\n    gues for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s active, consistent opposition rule, claim\n    ing that employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible\n    discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise when things go\n    badly for an employee who responded to enquiries. Employers, how\n    ever, have a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to dis\n    criminatory activity in their operations because Burlington Indus\n    tries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 765, and Faragher v. Boca Raton,\n    524 U. S. 775, 807, hold \u201c[a]n employer . . . subject to vicarious liabil\n    ity to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment\n    created by a supervisor with . . . authority over the employee.\u201d The\n    Circuit\u2019s rule could undermine the Ellerth-Faragher scheme, along\n    with the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018primary objective\u2019 \u201d of \u201cavoid[ing] harm\u201d to em\n    ployees, Faragher, supra, at 806, for if an employee reporting dis\n    crimination in answer to an employer\u2019s questions could be penalized\n    with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep\n    quiet about Title VII offenses. Because Crawford\u2019s conduct is covered\n    by the opposition clause, this Court does not reach her argument that\n    the Sixth Circuit also misread the participation clause. Metro\u2019s other\n    defenses to the retaliation claim were never reached by the District\n    Court, and thus remain open on remand. Pp. 3\u20138.\n211 Fed.

The\nquestion here is whether this protection extends to an\nemployee who speaks out about discrimination not on her\nown initiative, but in answering questions during an\nemployer\u2019s internal investigation. We hold that it does.\n                           I\n  In 2002, respondent Metropolitan Government of                               Nash\nville and Davidson County, Tennessee (Metro),                                  began\nlooking into rumors of sexual harassment by the                                Metro\nSchool District\u2019s employee relations director,                                  Gene\nHughes.1 211 Fed.

Haugen, 543 U. S. 194, 195, n. 2 (2004) (per curiam).\n2      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nVeronica Frazier, a Metro human resources officer, asked\npetitioner Vicky Crawford, a 30-year Metro employee,\nwhether she had witnessed \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d on\nthe part of Hughes, id., at 374\u2013375, Crawford described\nseveral instances of sexually harassing behavior: once,\nHughes had answered her greeting, \u201c \u2018Hey Dr. Hughes,\nwhat\u2019s up?,\u2019 \u201d by grabbing his crotch and saying \u201c \u2018[Y]ou\nknow what\u2019s up\u2019 \u201d; he had repeatedly \u201c \u2018put his crotch up to\n[her] window\u2019 \u201d; and on one occasion he had entered her\noffice and \u201c \u2018grabbed her head and pulled it to his crotch,\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 375, and n. 1. Two other employees also reported\nbeing sexually harassed by Hughes. Id., at 375. Although\nMetro took no action against Hughes, it did fire Crawford\nand the two other accusers soon after finishing the inves\ntigation, saying in Crawford\u2019s case that it was for embez\nzlement. Ibid. Crawford claimed Metro was retaliating\nfor her report of Hughes\u2019s behavior and filed a charge of a\nTitle VII violation with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC), followed by this suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of\nTennessee. Ibid.\n   The Title VII antiretaliation provision has two clauses,\nmaking it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an em\nployer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . [1]\nbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful\nemployment practice by this subchapter, or [2] because he\nhas made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in\nany manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\nunder this subchapter.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a). The one\nis known as the \u201copposition clause,\u201d the other as the \u201cpar\nticipation clause,\u201d and Crawford accused Metro of violat\ning both.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment for\nMetro. It held that Crawford could not satisfy the opposi\ntion clause because she had not \u201cinstigated or initiated\nany complaint,\u201d but had \u201cmerely answered questions by\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninvestigators in an already-pending internal investigation,\ninitiated by someone else.\u201d Memorandum Opinion, No.\n3:03\u2013cv\u201300996 (MD Tenn., Jan. 6, 2005), App. C to Pet. for\nCert. 16a\u201317a. It concluded that her claim also failed\nunder the participation clause, which Sixth Circuit prece\ndent confined to protecting \u201c \u2018an employee\u2019s participation\nin an employer\u2019s internal investigation . . . where that\ninvestigation occurs pursuant to a pending EEOC charge\u2019 \u201d\n(not the case here). Id., at 15a (emphasis omitted) (quot\ning Abbott v. Crown Motor Co., 348 F. 3d 537, 543 (CA6\n2003)).\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the same grounds,\nholding that the opposition clause \u201c \u2018demands active, con\nsistent \u201copposing\u201d activities to warrant . . . protection\nagainst retaliation,\u2019 \u201d 211 Fed. Appx., at 376 (quoting Bell\nv. Safety Grooving & Grinding, LP, 107 Fed. Appx. 607,\n610 (CA6 2004)), whereas Crawford did \u201cnot claim to have\ninstigated or initiated any complaint prior to her partici\npation in the investigation, nor did she take any further\naction following the investigation and prior to her firing.\u201d\n211 Fed. Appx., at 376. Again like the trial judge, the\nCourt of Appeals understood that Crawford could show no\nviolation of the participation clause because her \u201c \u2018em\nployer\u2019s internal investigation\u2019 \u201d was not conducted \u201c \u2018pur\nsuant to a pending EEOC charge.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Abbott,\nsupra, at 543).\n  Because the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision conflicts with those\nof other Circuits, particularly as to the opposition clause,\nsee, e.g., McDonnell v. Cisneros, 84 F. 3d 256, 262 (CA7\n1996), we granted Crawford\u2019s petition for certiorari. 552\nU. S. ___ (2008). We now reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n                          II\n  The opposition clause makes it \u201cunlawful . . . for an\nemployer to discriminate against any . . . employe[e] . . .\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbecause he has opposed any practice made . . . unlawful\n. . . by this subchapter.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20133(a). The term \u201coppose,\u201d\nbeing left undefined by the statute, carries its ordinary\nmeaning, Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979):\n\u201cto resist or antagonize . . . ; to contend against; to con\nfront; resist; withstand,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 1710 (2d ed. 1958). Although these actions\nentail varying expenditures of energy, \u201cRESIST frequently\nimplies more active striving than OPPOSE.\u201d Ibid.; see also\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 1359\n(2d ed. 1987) (defining \u201coppose\u201d as \u201cto be hostile or adverse\nto, as in opinion\u201d).\n    The statement Crawford says she gave to Frazier is thus\ncovered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disap\nproving account of sexually obnoxious behavior toward her\nby a fellow employee, an answer she says antagonized her\nemployer to the point of sacking her on a false pretense.\nCrawford\u2019s description of the louche goings-on would\ncertainly qualify in the minds of reasonable jurors as\n\u201cresist[ant]\u201d or \u201cantagoni[stic]\u201d to Hughes\u2019s treatment, if\nfor no other reason than the point argued by the Govern\nment and explained by an EEOC guideline: \u201cWhen an\nemployee communicates to her employer a belief that the\nemployer has engaged in . . . a form of employment dis\ncrimination, that communication\u201d virtually always \u201cconsti\ntutes the employee\u2019s opposition to the activity.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 9 (citing 2 EEOC Compli\nance Manual \u00a7\u00a78\u2013II\u2013B(1), (2), p. 614:0003 (Mar. 2003));\nsee also Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U. S. ___,\n___ (2008) (slip op., at 8) (explaining that EEOC compli\nance manuals \u201creflect \u2018a body of experience and informed\njudgment to which courts and litigants may properly\nresort for guidance\u2019 \u201d (quoting Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S.\n624, 642 (1998))). It is true that one can imagine excep\ntions, like an employee\u2019s description of a supervisor\u2019s\nracist joke as hilarious, but these will be eccentric cases,\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand this is not one of them.2\n   The Sixth Circuit thought answering questions fell short\nof opposition, taking the view that the clause \u201c \u2018demands\nactive, consistent \u201copposing\u201d activities to warrant . . .\nprotection against retaliation,\u2019 \u201d 211 Fed. Appx., at 376\n(quoting Bell, supra, at 610), and that an employee must\n\u201cinstigat[e] or initiat[e]\u201d a complaint to be covered, 211\nFed. Appx., at 376. But though these requirements obvi\nously exemplify opposition as commonly understood, they\nare not limits of it.\n   \u201cOppose\u201d goes beyond \u201cactive, consistent\u201d behavior in\nordinary discourse, where we would naturally use the\nword to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to\nadvance a position beyond disclosing it. Countless people\nwere known to \u201coppose\u201d slavery before Emancipation, or\nare said to \u201coppose\u201d capital punishment today, without\nwriting public letters, taking to the streets, or resisting\nthe government. And we would call it \u201copposition\u201d if an\nemployee took a stand against an employer\u2019s discrimina\ntory practices not by \u201cinstigating\u201d action, but by standing\npat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor\u2019s order to fire a\njunior worker for discriminatory reasons. Cf. McDonnell,\nsupra, at 262 (finding employee covered by Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 where his employer retaliated\nagainst him for failing to prevent his subordinate from\nfiling an EEOC charge). There is, then, no reason to doubt\nthat a person can \u201coppose\u201d by responding to someone else\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Metro suggests in passing that it was unclear whether Crawford\n\nactually opposed Hughes\u2019s behavior because some of her defensive\nresponses were \u201cinappropriate,\u201d such as telling Hughes to \u201cbite me\u201d and\n\u201cflip[ping] him a bird.\u201d Brief for Respondent 1\u20132 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This argument fails not only because at the summary\njudgment stage we must \u201cview all facts and draw all reasonable infer\nences in [Crawford\u2019s] favor,\u201d Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 195, n. 2, but also\nbecause Crawford gave no indication that Hughes\u2019s gross clowning was\nanything but offensive to her.\n6      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nquestion just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and\nnothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting\nan employee who reports discrimination on her own initia\ntive but not one who reports the same discrimination in\nthe same words when her boss asks a question.\n   Metro and its amici support the Circuit panel\u2019s insis\ntence on \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cconsistent\u201d opposition by arguing\nthat the lower the bar for retaliation claims, the less likely\nit is that employers will look into what may be happening\noutside the executive suite. As they see it, if retaliation\nis an easy charge when things go bad for an employee\nwho responded to enquiries, employers will avoid the\nheadache by refusing to raise questions about possible\ndiscrimination.\n   The argument is unconvincing, for we think it underes\ntimates the incentive to enquire that follows from our\ndecisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524\nU. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S.\n775 (1998). Ellerth and Faragher hold \u201c[a]n employer . . .\nsubject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for\nan actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor\nwith . . . authority over the employee.\u201d Ellerth, supra, at\n765; Faragher, supra, at 807. Although there is no af\nfirmative defense if the hostile environment \u201cculminates\nin a tangible employment action\u201d against the employee,\nEllerth, 524 U. S., at 765, an employer does have a defense\n\u201c[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken\u201d if it\n\u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly\nany\u201d discriminatory conduct and \u201cthe plaintiff employee\nunreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or\ncorrective opportunities provided by the employer or to\navoid harm otherwise,\u201d ibid. Employers are thus subject\nto a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to any\ndiscriminatory activity in their operations as a way to\nbreak the circuit of imputed liability. Ibid.; see also Brief\nfor Petitioner 24\u201328, and nn. 31\u201335 (citing studies demon\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrating that Ellerth and Faragher have prompted many\nemployers to adopt or strengthen procedures for investi\ngating, preventing, and correcting discriminatory con\nduct). The possibility that an employer might someday\nwant to fire someone who might charge discrimination\ntraceable to an internal investigation does not strike us as\nlikely to diminish the attraction of an Ellerth-Faragher\naffirmative defense.\n   That aside, we find it hard to see why the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\nrule would not itself largely undermine the Ellerth-\nFaragher scheme, along with the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018primary objec\ntive\u2019 \u201d of \u201cavoid[ing] harm\u201d to employees. Faragher, supra,\nat 806 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S.\n405, 417 (1975)). If it were clear law that an employee\nwho reported discrimination in answering an employer\u2019s\nquestions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent\nemployees would have a good reason to keep quiet about\nTitle VII offenses against themselves or against others.\nThis is no imaginary horrible given the documented indi\ncations that \u201c[f]ear of retaliation is the leading reason why\npeople stay silent instead of voicing their concerns about\nbias and discrimination.\u201d Brake, Retaliation, 90 Minn.\nL. Rev. 18, 20 (2005); see also id., at 37, and n. 58 (compil\ning studies). The appeals court\u2019s rule would thus create a\nreal dilemma for any knowledgeable employee in a hostile\nwork environment if the boss took steps to assure a de\nfense under our cases. If the employee reported discrimi\nnation in response to the enquiries, the employer might\nwell be free to penalize her for speaking up. But if she\nkept quiet about the discrimination and later filed a Title\nVII claim, the employer might well escape liability, argu\ning that it \u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and cor\nrect [any discrimination] promptly\u201d but \u201cthe plaintiff\nemployee unreasonably failed to take advantage of . . .\npreventive or corrective opportunities provided by the\nemployer.\u201d Ellerth, supra, at 765.

But that\ndoes not mean the end of this case, for Metro\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment raised several defenses to the retalia\ntion charge besides the scope of the two clauses; the Dis\ntrict Court never reached these others owing to its ruling\non the elements of retaliation, and they remain open on\nremand.\n                            III\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Metro also argues that \u201c[r]equiring the employee to actually initiate\n\na complaint . . . conforms with the employee\u2019s \u2018obligation of reasonable\ncare to avoid harm\u2019 articulated in Faragher and Ellerth.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 28 (quoting Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807\n(1998)). But that mitigation requirement only applies to employees\nwho are suffering discrimination and have the opportunity to fix it by\n\u201ctak[ing] advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities\nprovided by the employer,\u201d ibid.; it is based on the general principle\n\u201cthat a victim has a duty \u2018to use such means as are reasonable under\nthe circumstances to avoid or minimize . . . damages,\u2019 \u201d id., at 806\n(quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982)). We\nhave never suggested that employees have a legal obligation to report\ndiscrimination against others to their employer on their own initiative,\nlet alone lose statutory protection by failing to speak. Extending the\nmitigation requirement so far would make no sense; employees will\noften face retaliation not for opposing discrimination they themselves\nface, but for reporting discrimination suffered by others. Thus, they are\nnot \u201cvictims\u201d of anything until they are retaliated against, and it would\nbe absurd to require them to \u201cmitigate\u201d damages they may be unaware\nthey will suffer.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S. C. \u00a72000e et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), prohibits\nretaliation against an employee who testifies in an inter\nnal investigation of alleged sexual harassment. I agree\nwith the Court that the \u201copposition clause\u201d of \u00a72000e\u20133(a)\n(2000 ed.) prohibits retaliation for such conduct. I also\nagree with the Court\u2019s primary reasoning, which is based\non \u201cthe point argued by the Government and explained by\nan EEOC guideline: \u2018When an employee communicates to\nher employer a belief that the employer has engaged in . . .\na form of employment discrimination, that communication\u2019\nvirtually always \u2018constitutes the employee\u2019s opposition to\nthe activity.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 4. I write separately to emphasize\nmy understanding that the Court\u2019s holding does not\nand should not extend beyond employees who testify in\ninternal investigations or engage in analogous purposive\nconduct.\n  As the Court concludes, the term \u201coppose\u201d does not\ndenote conduct that necessarily rises to the level required\nby the Sixth Circuit\u2014i.e., conduct that is \u201c \u2018consistent\u2019 \u201d\nand \u201cinstigated or initiated\u201d by the employee. 211 Fed.\n2      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n              ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\nAppx. 373, 376 (2006). The primary definitions of the\nterm \u201coppose\u201d do, however, require conduct that is active\nand purposive. See Webster\u2019s New International Diction\nary 1709\u20131710 (2d ed. 1953); Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1010 (1966) (hereinafter Random\nDict.); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 866\u2013867 (2d ed.\n1989). For example, the first three definitions of the term\nin the dictionary upon which the Court principally relies\nare as follows:\n    \u201c1. to act against or provide resistance to; combat. 2.\n    to stand in the way of; hinder; obstruct. 3. to set as an\n    opponent or adversary.\u201d Random Dict. 1359 (2d ed.\n    1987).\nIn accordance with these definitions, petitioner contends\nthat the statutory term \u201coppose\u201d means \u201ctaking action\n(including making a statement) to end, prevent, redress,\nor correct unlawful discrimination.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n40.\n   In order to decide the question that is before us, we have\nno need to adopt a definition of the term \u201coppose\u201d that is\nbroader than the definition that petitioner advances. But\nin dicta, the Court notes that the fourth listed definition in\nthe Random House Dictionary of the English Language\ngoes further, defining \u201coppose\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018to be hostile or\nadverse to, as in opinion.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 4 (emphasis added).\nThus, this definition embraces silent opposition.\n   While this is certainly an accepted usage of the term\n\u201coppose,\u201d the term is not always used in this sense, and it\nis questionable whether silent opposition is covered by the\nopposition clause of 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a). It is notewor\nthy that all of the other conduct protected by this provi\nsion\u2014making a charge, testifying, or assisting or partici\npating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\u2014\nrequires active and purposive conduct. \u201c \u2018That several\nitems in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpreting the other items as possessing that attribute\nas well.\u2019 \u201d S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental\nProtection, 547 U. S. 370, 378 (2006) (quoting Beecham v.\nUnited States, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994)).\n   An interpretation of the opposition clause that protects\nconduct that is not active and purposive would have im\nportant practical implications. It would open the door to\nretaliation claims by employees who never expressed a\nword of opposition to their employers. To be sure, in many\ncases, such employees would not be able to show that\nmanagement was aware of their opposition and thus\nwould not be able to show that their opposition caused the\nadverse actions at issue. But in other cases, such employ\nees might well be able to create a genuine factual issue on\nthe question of causation. Suppose, for example, that an\nemployee alleges that he or she expressed opposition while\ninformally chatting with a co-worker at the proverbial\nwater cooler or in a workplace telephone conversation that\nwas overheard by a co-worker. Or suppose that an em\nployee alleges that such a conversation occurred after\nwork at a restaurant or tavern frequented by co-workers\nor at a neighborhood picnic attended by a friend or relative\nof a supervisor.\n   Some courts hold that an employee asserting a retalia\ntion claim can prove causation simply by showing that the\nadverse employment action occurred within a short time\nafter the protected conduct. See, e.g., Clark County School\nDist. v. Breeden, 532 U. S. 268, 273 (2001) (per curiam)\n(noting that some cases \u201caccept mere temporal proximity\nbetween an employer\u2019s knowledge of protected activity and\nan adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of\ncausality to establish a prima facie case\u201d); see also\nGorman-Bakos v. Cornell Cooperative Extension of\nSchenectady Cty., 252 F. 3d 545, 554 (CA2 2001); Conner\nv. Schnuk Markets, Inc., 121 F. 3d 1390, 1395 (CA10\n1997); Dey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., 28 F. 3d 1446, 1458\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n             ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n(CA7 1994). As a result, an employee claiming retaliation\nmay be able to establish causation simply by showing that,\nwithin some time period prior to the adverse action, the\nemployer, by some indirect means, became aware of the\nviews that the employee had expressed. Where the pro\ntected conduct consisted of a private conversation, applica\ntion of this rule would be especially problematic because of\nuncertainty regarding the point in time when the em\nployer became aware of the employee\u2019s private expressions\nof disapproval.\n   The number of retaliation claims filed with the EEOC\nhas proliferated in recent years. See U. S. Equal Em\nployment Opportunity Commission, Charge Statistics:\nFY 1997 Through FY 2007, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/\ncharges.html; Charge Statistics: FY 1992 Through FY\n1996, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/charges-a.html (as visited\nJan. 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file)\n(showing that retaliation charges filed with the EEOC\ndoubled between 1992 and 2007). An expansive interpre\ntation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause\nthis trend to accelerate.\n   The question whether the opposition clause shields\nemployees who do not communicate their views to their\nemployers through purposive conduct is not before us in\nthis case; the answer to that question is far from clear;\nand I do not understand the Court\u2019s holding to reach that\nissue here. For present purposes, it is enough to hold that\nthe opposition clause does protect an employee, like peti\ntioner, who testifies about unlawful conduct in an internal\ninvestigation.\n",

Argued October 8, 2008\u2014Decided January 26, 2009\nIn response to questions from an official of respondent local government\n  (Metro) during an internal investigation into rumors of sexual har\n  assment by the Metro School District employee relations director\n  (Hughes), petitioner Crawford, a 30-year employee, reported that\n  Hughes had sexually harassed her. Metro took no action against\n  Hughes, but soon fired Crawford, alleging embezzlement. She filed\n  suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, claiming that\n  Metro was retaliating for her report of Hughes\u2019s behavior, in violation\n  of 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a), which makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer\n  to discriminate against any . . . employe[e]\u201d who (1) \u201chas opposed any\n  practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter\u201d\n  (opposition clause), or (2) \u201chas made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n  participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hear\n  ing under this subchapter\u201d (participation clause). The court granted\n  Metro summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding\n  that the opposition clause demanded \u201cactive, consistent\u201d opposing ac\n  tivities, whereas Crawford had not initiated any complaint prior to\n  the investigation, and finding that the participation clause did not\n  cover Metro\u2019s internal investigation because it was not conducted\n  pursuant to a Title VII charge pending with the Equal Employment\n  Opportunity Commission.\nHeld: The antiretaliation provision\u2019s protection extends to an employee\n who speaks out about discrimination not on her own initiative, but in\n answering questions during an employer\u2019s internal investigation.\n Because \u201coppose\u201d is undefined by statute, it carries its ordinary dic\n tionary meaning of resisting or contending against. Crawford\u2019s\n statement is thus covered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly\n2         CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n               NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    disapproving account of Hughes\u2019s sexually obnoxious behavior toward\n    her. \u201cOppose\u201d goes beyond \u201cactive, consistent\u201d behavior in ordinary\n    discourse, and may be used to speak of someone who has taken no ac\n    tion at all to advance a position beyond disclosing it. Thus, a person\n    can \u201coppose\u201d by responding to someone else\u2019s questions just as surely\n    as by provoking the discussion. Nothing in the statute requires a\n    freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on\n    her own initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in\n    the same words when asked a question. Metro unconvincingly ar\n    gues for the Sixth Circuit\u2019s active, consistent opposition rule, claim\n    ing that employers will be less likely to raise questions about possible\n    discrimination if a retaliation charge is easy to raise when things go\n    badly for an employee who responded to enquiries. Employers, how\n    ever, have a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to dis\n    criminatory activity in their operations because Burlington Indus\n    tries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 765, and Faragher v. Boca Raton,\n    524 U. S. 775, 807, hold \u201c[a]n employer . . . subject to vicarious liabil\n    ity to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment\n    created by a supervisor with . . . authority over the employee.\u201d The\n    Circuit\u2019s rule could undermine the Ellerth-Faragher scheme, along\n    with the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018primary objective\u2019 \u201d of \u201cavoid[ing] harm\u201d to em\n    ployees, Faragher, supra, at 806, for if an employee reporting dis\n    crimination in answer to an employer\u2019s questions could be penalized\n    with no remedy, prudent employees would have a good reason to keep\n    quiet about Title VII offenses. Because Crawford\u2019s conduct is covered\n    by the opposition clause, this Court does not reach her argument that\n    the Sixth Circuit also misread the participation clause.

Two other employees also reported\nbeing sexually harassed by Hughes. Id., at 375. Although\nMetro took no action against Hughes, it did fire Crawford\nand the two other accusers soon after finishing the inves\ntigation, saying in Crawford\u2019s case that it was for embez\nzlement. Ibid. Crawford claimed Metro was retaliating\nfor her report of Hughes\u2019s behavior and filed a charge of a\nTitle VII violation with the Equal Employment Opportu\nnity Commission (EEOC), followed by this suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Middle District of\nTennessee. Ibid.\n   The Title VII antiretaliation provision has two clauses,\nmaking it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an em\nployer to discriminate against any of his employees . . .

Cisneros, 84 F. 3d 256, 262 (CA7\n1996), we granted Crawford\u2019s petition for certiorari. 552\nU. S. ___ (2008). We now reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n                          II\n  The opposition clause makes it \u201cunlawful . . . for an\nemployer to discriminate against any . . . employe[e] . . .\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbecause he has opposed any practice made . . . unlawful\n. . . by this subchapter.\u201d \u00a72000e\u20133(a). The term \u201coppose,\u201d\nbeing left undefined by the statute, carries its ordinary\nmeaning, Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979):\n\u201cto resist or antagonize . . . ; to contend against; to con\nfront; resist; withstand,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 1710 (2d ed. 1958). Although these actions\nentail varying expenditures of energy, \u201cRESIST frequently\nimplies more active striving than OPPOSE.\u201d Ibid.; see also\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 1359\n(2d ed. 1987) (defining \u201coppose\u201d as \u201cto be hostile or adverse\nto, as in opinion\u201d).\n    The statement Crawford says she gave to Frazier is thus\ncovered by the opposition clause, as an ostensibly disap\nproving account of sexually obnoxious behavior toward her\nby a fellow employee, an answer she says antagonized her\nemployer to the point of sacking her on a false pretense.\nCrawford\u2019s description of the louche goings-on would\ncertainly qualify in the minds of reasonable jurors as\n\u201cresist[ant]\u201d or \u201cantagoni[stic]\u201d to Hughes\u2019s treatment, if\nfor no other reason than the point argued by the Govern\nment and explained by an EEOC guideline: \u201cWhen an\nemployee communicates to her employer a belief that the\nemployer has engaged in . . . a form of employment dis\ncrimination, that communication\u201d virtually always \u201cconsti\ntutes the employee\u2019s opposition to the activity.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 9 (citing 2 EEOC Compli\nance Manual \u00a7\u00a78\u2013II\u2013B(1), (2), p. 614:0003 (Mar. 2003));\nsee also Federal Express Corp. v.

Abbott, 524 U. S.\n624, 642 (1998))). It is true that one can imagine excep\ntions, like an employee\u2019s description of a supervisor\u2019s\nracist joke as hilarious, but these will be eccentric cases,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Appx., at 376\n(quoting Bell, supra, at 610), and that an employee must\n\u201cinstigat[e] or initiat[e]\u201d a complaint to be covered, 211\nFed. Appx., at 376. But though these requirements obvi\nously exemplify opposition as commonly understood, they\nare not limits of it.\n   \u201cOppose\u201d goes beyond \u201cactive, consistent\u201d behavior in\nordinary discourse, where we would naturally use the\nword to speak of someone who has taken no action at all to\nadvance a position beyond disclosing it. Countless people\nwere known to \u201coppose\u201d slavery before Emancipation, or\nare said to \u201coppose\u201d capital punishment today, without\nwriting public letters, taking to the streets, or resisting\nthe government. And we would call it \u201copposition\u201d if an\nemployee took a stand against an employer\u2019s discrimina\ntory practices not by \u201cinstigating\u201d action, but by standing\npat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor\u2019s order to fire a\njunior worker for discriminatory reasons. Cf. McDonnell,\nsupra, at 262 (finding employee covered by Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 where his employer retaliated\nagainst him for failing to prevent his subordinate from\nfiling an EEOC charge). There is, then, no reason to doubt\nthat a person can \u201coppose\u201d by responding to someone else\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Metro suggests in passing that it was unclear whether Crawford\n\nactually opposed Hughes\u2019s behavior because some of her defensive\nresponses were \u201cinappropriate,\u201d such as telling Hughes to \u201cbite me\u201d and\n\u201cflip[ping] him a bird.\u201d Brief for Respondent 1\u20132 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This argument fails not only because at the summary\njudgment stage we must \u201cview all facts and draw all reasonable infer\nences in [Crawford\u2019s] favor,\u201d Brosseau, 543 U. S., at 195, n. 2, but also\nbecause Crawford gave no indication that Hughes\u2019s gross clowning was\nanything but offensive to her.\n6      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nquestion just as surely as by provoking the discussion, and\nnothing in the statute requires a freakish rule protecting\nan employee who reports discrimination on her own initia\ntive but not one who reports the same discrimination in\nthe same words when her boss asks a question.\n   Metro and its amici support the Circuit panel\u2019s insis\ntence on \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cconsistent\u201d opposition by arguing\nthat the lower the bar for retaliation claims, the less likely\nit is that employers will look into what may be happening\noutside the executive suite. As they see it, if retaliation\nis an easy charge when things go bad for an employee\nwho responded to enquiries, employers will avoid the\nheadache by refusing to raise questions about possible\ndiscrimination.\n   The argument is unconvincing, for we think it underes\ntimates the incentive to enquire that follows from our\ndecisions in Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524\nU. S. 742 (1998), and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S.\n775 (1998). Ellerth and Faragher hold \u201c[a]n employer . . .\nsubject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for\nan actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor\nwith . . . authority over the employee.\u201d Ellerth, supra, at\n765; Faragher, supra, at 807. Although there is no af\nfirmative defense if the hostile environment \u201cculminates\nin a tangible employment action\u201d against the employee,\nEllerth, 524 U. S., at 765, an employer does have a defense\n\u201c[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken\u201d if it\n\u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly\nany\u201d discriminatory conduct and \u201cthe plaintiff employee\nunreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or\ncorrective opportunities provided by the employer or to\navoid harm otherwise,\u201d ibid. Employers are thus subject\nto a strong inducement to ferret out and put a stop to any\ndiscriminatory activity in their operations as a way to\nbreak the circuit of imputed liability. Ibid.; see also Brief\nfor Petitioner 24\u201328, and nn. 31\u201335 (citing studies demon\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrating that Ellerth and Faragher have prompted many\nemployers to adopt or strengthen procedures for investi\ngating, preventing, and correcting discriminatory con\nduct). The possibility that an employer might someday\nwant to fire someone who might charge discrimination\ntraceable to an internal investigation does not strike us as\nlikely to diminish the attraction of an Ellerth-Faragher\naffirmative defense.\n   That aside, we find it hard to see why the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\nrule would not itself largely undermine the Ellerth-\nFaragher scheme, along with the statute\u2019s \u201c \u2018primary objec\ntive\u2019 \u201d of \u201cavoid[ing] harm\u201d to employees. Faragher, supra,\nat 806 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S.\n405, 417 (1975)). If it were clear law that an employee\nwho reported discrimination in answering an employer\u2019s\nquestions could be penalized with no remedy, prudent\nemployees would have a good reason to keep quiet about\nTitle VII offenses against themselves or against others.\nThis is no imaginary horrible given the documented indi\ncations that \u201c[f]ear of retaliation is the leading reason why\npeople stay silent instead of voicing their concerns about\nbias and discrimination.\u201d Brake, Retaliation, 90 Minn.\nL. Rev. 18, 20 (2005); see also id., at 37, and n. 58 (compil\ning studies). The appeals court\u2019s rule would thus create a\nreal dilemma for any knowledgeable employee in a hostile\nwork environment if the boss took steps to assure a de\nfense under our cases. If the employee reported discrimi\nnation in response to the enquiries, the employer might\nwell be free to penalize her for speaking up. But if she\nkept quiet about the discrimination and later filed a Title\nVII claim, the employer might well escape liability, argu\ning that it \u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and cor\nrect [any discrimination] promptly\u201d but \u201cthe plaintiff\nemployee unreasonably failed to take advantage of . . .\npreventive or corrective opportunities provided by the\nemployer.\u201d Ellerth, supra, at 765. Nothing in the statute\u2019s\n8       CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n             NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ntext or our precedent supports this catch-22.3\n   Because Crawford\u2019s conduct is covered by the opposition\nclause, we do not reach her argument that the Sixth Cir\ncuit misread the participation clause as well. But that\ndoes not mean the end of this case, for Metro\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment raised several defenses to the retalia\ntion charge besides the scope of the two clauses; the Dis\ntrict Court never reached these others owing to its ruling\non the elements of retaliation, and they remain open on\nremand.\n                            III\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Metro also argues that \u201c[r]equiring the employee to actually initiate\n\na complaint . . . conforms with the employee\u2019s \u2018obligation of reasonable\ncare to avoid harm\u2019 articulated in Faragher and Ellerth.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 28 (quoting Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807\n(1998)). But that mitigation requirement only applies to employees\nwho are suffering discrimination and have the opportunity to fix it by\n\u201ctak[ing] advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities\nprovided by the employer,\u201d ibid.; it is based on the general principle\n\u201cthat a victim has a duty \u2018to use such means as are reasonable under\nthe circumstances to avoid or minimize . . . damages,\u2019 \u201d id., at 806\n(quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982)). We\nhave never suggested that employees have a legal obligation to report\ndiscrimination against others to their employer on their own initiative,\nlet alone lose statutory protection by failing to speak. Extending the\nmitigation requirement so far would make no sense; employees will\noften face retaliation not for opposing discrimination they themselves\nface, but for reporting discrimination suffered by others. Thus, they are\nnot \u201cvictims\u201d of anything until they are retaliated against, and it would\nbe absurd to require them to \u201cmitigate\u201d damages they may be unaware\nthey will suffer.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S. C. \u00a72000e et seq. (2000 ed. and Supp. V), prohibits\nretaliation against an employee who testifies in an inter\nnal investigation of alleged sexual harassment. I agree\nwith the Court that the \u201copposition clause\u201d of \u00a72000e\u20133(a)\n(2000 ed.) prohibits retaliation for such conduct. I also\nagree with the Court\u2019s primary reasoning, which is based\non \u201cthe point argued by the Government and explained by\nan EEOC guideline: \u2018When an employee communicates to\nher employer a belief that the employer has engaged in . . .\na form of employment discrimination, that communication\u2019\nvirtually always \u2018constitutes the employee\u2019s opposition to\nthe activity.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 4. I write separately to emphasize\nmy understanding that the Court\u2019s holding does not\nand should not extend beyond employees who testify in\ninternal investigations or engage in analogous purposive\nconduct.\n  As the Court concludes, the term \u201coppose\u201d does not\ndenote conduct that necessarily rises to the level required\nby the Sixth Circuit\u2014i.e., conduct that is \u201c \u2018consistent\u2019 \u201d\nand \u201cinstigated or initiated\u201d by the employee. 211 Fed.\n2      CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n            NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n              ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\nAppx. 373, 376 (2006). The primary definitions of the\nterm \u201coppose\u201d do, however, require conduct that is active\nand purposive. See Webster\u2019s New International Diction\nary 1709\u20131710 (2d ed. 1953); Random House Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1010 (1966) (hereinafter Random\nDict.); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 866\u2013867 (2d ed.\n1989). For example, the first three definitions of the term\nin the dictionary upon which the Court principally relies\nare as follows:\n    \u201c1. to act against or provide resistance to; combat. 2.\n    to stand in the way of; hinder; obstruct. 3. to set as an\n    opponent or adversary.\u201d Random Dict. 1359 (2d ed.\n    1987).\nIn accordance with these definitions, petitioner contends\nthat the statutory term \u201coppose\u201d means \u201ctaking action\n(including making a statement) to end, prevent, redress,\nor correct unlawful discrimination.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n40.\n   In order to decide the question that is before us, we have\nno need to adopt a definition of the term \u201coppose\u201d that is\nbroader than the definition that petitioner advances. But\nin dicta, the Court notes that the fourth listed definition in\nthe Random House Dictionary of the English Language\ngoes further, defining \u201coppose\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018to be hostile or\nadverse to, as in opinion.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 4 (emphasis added).\nThus, this definition embraces silent opposition.\n   While this is certainly an accepted usage of the term\n\u201coppose,\u201d the term is not always used in this sense, and it\nis questionable whether silent opposition is covered by the\nopposition clause of 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20133(a). It is notewor\nthy that all of the other conduct protected by this provi\nsion\u2014making a charge, testifying, or assisting or partici\npating in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\u2014\nrequires active and purposive conduct. \u201c \u2018That several\nitems in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninterpreting the other items as possessing that attribute\nas well.\u2019 \u201d S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental\nProtection, 547 U. S. 370, 378 (2006) (quoting Beecham v.\nUnited States, 511 U. S. 368, 371 (1994)).\n   An interpretation of the opposition clause that protects\nconduct that is not active and purposive would have im\nportant practical implications. It would open the door to\nretaliation claims by employees who never expressed a\nword of opposition to their employers. To be sure, in many\ncases, such employees would not be able to show that\nmanagement was aware of their opposition and thus\nwould not be able to show that their opposition caused the\nadverse actions at issue. But in other cases, such employ\nees might well be able to create a genuine factual issue on\nthe question of causation. Suppose, for example, that an\nemployee alleges that he or she expressed opposition while\ninformally chatting with a co-worker at the proverbial\nwater cooler or in a workplace telephone conversation that\nwas overheard by a co-worker. Or suppose that an em\nployee alleges that such a conversation occurred after\nwork at a restaurant or tavern frequented by co-workers\nor at a neighborhood picnic attended by a friend or relative\nof a supervisor.\n   Some courts hold that an employee asserting a retalia\ntion claim can prove causation simply by showing that the\nadverse employment action occurred within a short time\nafter the protected conduct. See, e.g., Clark County School\nDist. v. Breeden, 532 U. S. 268, 273 (2001) (per curiam)\n(noting that some cases \u201caccept mere temporal proximity\nbetween an employer\u2019s knowledge of protected activity and\nan adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of\ncausality to establish a prima facie case\u201d); see also\nGorman-Bakos v. Cornell Cooperative Extension of\nSchenectady Cty., 252 F. 3d 545, 554 (CA2 2001); Conner\nv. Schnuk Markets, Inc., 121 F. 3d 1390, 1395 (CA10\n1997); Dey v. Colt Constr. & Dev. Co., 28 F. 3d 1446, 1458\n4     CRAWFORD v. METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT OF \n\n           NASHVILLE AND DAVIDSON CTY. \n\n             ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\n(CA7 1994). As a result, an employee claiming retaliation\nmay be able to establish causation simply by showing that,\nwithin some time period prior to the adverse action, the\nemployer, by some indirect means, became aware of the\nviews that the employee had expressed. Where the pro\ntected conduct consisted of a private conversation, applica\ntion of this rule would be especially problematic because of\nuncertainty regarding the point in time when the em\nployer became aware of the employee\u2019s private expressions\nof disapproval.\n   The number of retaliation claims filed with the EEOC\nhas proliferated in recent years. See U. S. Equal Em\nployment Opportunity Commission, Charge Statistics:\nFY 1997 Through FY 2007, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/\ncharges.html; Charge Statistics: FY 1992 Through FY\n1996, http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/charges-a.html (as visited\nJan. 16, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file)\n(showing that retaliation charges filed with the EEOC\ndoubled between 1992 and 2007). An expansive interpre\ntation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause\nthis trend to accelerate.\n   The question whether the opposition clause shields\nemployees who do not communicate their views to their\nemployers through purposive conduct is not before us in\nthis case; the answer to that question is far from clear;\nand I do not understand the Court\u2019s holding to reach that\nissue here. For present purposes, it is enough to hold that\nthe opposition clause does protect an employee, like peti\ntioner, who testifies about unlawful conduct in an internal\ninvestigation.\n</pre>",
