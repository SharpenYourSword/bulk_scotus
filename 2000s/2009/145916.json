UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\noffense level of 34 and a sentencing range of 210 to 262\nmonths’ imprisonment. The District Court sentenced\nSpears to 240 months in prison, the statutory mandatory\nminimum. See United States v. Spears, 469 F. 3d 1166,\n1173–1174 (CA8 2006) (en banc) (Spears I).\n   On cross-appeal, the Government argued that “the\ndistrict court erred by categorically rejecting the 100:1\nquantity ratio and substituting its own ratio in calculating\nSpears’s sentence.” Id., at 1174. The Eighth Circuit\nreversed Spears’ sentence and remanded for resentencing,\nholding that “neither Booker nor §3553(a) authorizes\ndistrict courts to reject the 100:1 quantity ratio and use a\ndifferent ratio in sentencing defendants for crack cocaine\noffenses.” Id., at 1176. This Court vacated the judgment\nof the Eighth Circuit, and remanded for further considera\ntion in light of Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___\n(2007). Spears v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008).\n   On remand, the Eighth Circuit again reversed Spears’\nsentence and remanded for resentencing. 533 F. 3d 715,\n716 (2008) (en banc) (Spears II). It concluded, again, that\nthe District Court “may not categorically reject the ratio\nset forth by the Guidelines,” id., at 717, and “ ‘impermissi\nbly varied by replacing the 100:1 quantity ratio inherent\nin the advisory Guidelines range with a 20:1 quantity\nratio,’ ” ibid. (quoting Spears I, supra, at 1178). Spears\nagain petitioned for a writ of certiorari. Because the\nEighth Circuit’s decision on remand conflicts with our\ndecision in Kimbrough, we grant the petition for certiorari\nand reverse.\n   In Kimbrough, we held that “under Booker, the cocaine\nGuidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only,”\n552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2), and that “it would not be\nan abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when\nsentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder\ndisparity yields a sentence ‘greater than necessary’ to\nachieve §3553(a)’s purpose, even in a mine-run case,” id.,\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nat ___ (slip op., at 21) (emphasis added). The correct\ninterpretation of that holding is the one offered by the\ndissent in Spears II:\n    “The Court thus established that even when a particu\n    lar defendant in a crack cocaine case presents no spe\n    cial mitigating circumstances—no outstanding service\n    to country or community, no unusually disadvantaged\n    childhood, no overstated criminal history score, no\n    post-offense rehabilitation—a sentencing court may\n    nonetheless vary downward from the advisory guide\n    line range. The court may do so based solely on its\n    view that the 100-to-1 ratio embodied in the sentenc\n    ing guidelines for the treatment of crack cocaine ver\n    sus powder cocaine creates ‘an unwarranted disparity\n    within the meaning of §3553(a),’ and is ‘at odds with\n    §3553(a).’ The only fact necessary to justify such a\n    variance is the sentencing court’s disagreement with\n    the guidelines—its policy view that the 100-to-1 ratio\n    creates an unwarranted disparity.” 533 F. 3d, at 719\n    (opinion of Colloton, J.) (citations omitted).\n   Kimbrough considered and rejected the position taken\nby the Eighth Circuit below. It noted that “a district\ncourt’s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may\nattract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a\nparticular case ‘outside the “heartland” to which the\nCommission intends individual Guidelines to apply.’ ” 552\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20–21) (quoting Rita v. United\nStates, 551 U. S. 338, 351 (2007)). The implication was\nthat an “inside the heartland” departure (which is neces\nsarily based on a policy disagreement with the Guidelines\nand necessarily disagrees on a “categorical basis”) may be\nentitled to less respect. Our opinion said, however, that\nthe “crack cocaine Guidelines . . . present no occasion for\nelaborative discussion of this matter because those Guide\nlines do not exemplify the Commission’s exercise of its\n4                SPEARS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharacteristic institutional role.” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 21). Kimbrough thus holds that with respect to the\ncrack cocaine Guidelines, a categorical disagreement with\nand variance from the Guidelines is not suspect.\n   That was indeed the point of Kimbrough: a recognition\nof district courts’ authority to vary from the crack cocaine\nGuidelines based on policy disagreement with them, and\nnot simply based on an individualized determination that\nthey yield an excessive sentence in a particular case. The\nlatter proposition was already established pre-Kimbrough,\nsee United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 245–246 (2005),\nand the Government conceded as much in Kimbrough.\n552 U. S., at ___, n. 13 (slip op., at 13, n. 13). That the\nGovernment did not prevail in Kimbrough proves that its\nconcession—“that a district court may vary from the 100:1\nratio if it does so ‘based on the individualized circum\nstance[s]’ of a particular case,” ibid.—understated the\nextent of district courts’ sentencing discretion.\n   In drawing a distinction between “individualized, case\nspecific” consideration of the Guidelines’ ratio and cate\ngorical rejection and replacement of that ratio, the Eighth\nCircuit relied in part, Spears II, supra, at 717, on the\nfollowing passage from Kimbrough:\n    “The [district] court did not purport to establish a ra\n    tio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final\n    determination in line with §3553(a)’s overarching in\n    struction to ‘impose a sentence sufficient, but not\n    greater than necessary’ to accomplish the sentencing\n    goals advanced in §3553(a)(2).” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\n    op., at 22).\nThis says that it was “appropriate” for the District Court\nin Kimbrough not to specify what ratio it was using, but\nmerely to proceed with §3553(a) analysis. The Eighth\nCircuit read that to mean that district courts, in the\ncourse of their individualized determinations, may not\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ncategorically disagree with the Guidelines ratio, and (con\nsequently) may not substitute their own ratio for that of the\nGuidelines. If it meant that, our vacating of the Eighth\nCircuit’s judgment in Spears I would have been inexplica\nble, because that supposedly impermissible disagreement\nand substitution was precisely the reason for Spears I’s\nreversal of the District Court. See Spears I, 469 F. 3d, at\n1175–1176. As a logical matter, of course, rejection of the\n100:1 ratio, explicitly approved by Kimbrough, necessarily\nimplies adoption of some other ratio to govern the mine\nrun case. A sentencing judge who is given the power to\nreject the disparity created by the crack-to-powder ratio\nmust also possess the power to apply a different ratio\nwhich, in his judgment, corrects the disparity. Put simply,\nthe ability to reduce a mine-run defendant’s sentence\nnecessarily permits adoption of a replacement ratio.\n  To the extent the above quoted language has obscured\nKimbrough’s holding, we now clarify that district courts\nare entitled to reject and vary categorically from the crack\ncocaine Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with\nthose Guidelines. Here, the District Court’s choice of\nreplacement ratio was based upon two well-reasoned\ndecisions by other courts, which themselves reflected the\nSentencing Commission’s expert judgment that a 20:1\nratio would be appropriate in a mine-run case. See Perry,\n389 F. Supp. 2d, at 307–308; Smith, 359 F. Supp. 2d, at\n781–782; Report to Congress 106–107, App. A, pp. 3–6.\n  The alternative approach—adopted by the Eighth Cir\ncuit—would likely yield one of two results. Either district\ncourts would treat the Guidelines’ policy embodied in the\ncrack-to-powder ratio as mandatory, believing that they\nare not entitled to vary based on “categorical” policy dis\nagreements with the Guidelines, or they would continue to\nvary, masking their categorical policy disagreements as\n“individualized determinations.” The latter is institution\nalized subterfuge. The former contradicts our holding in\n6                SPEARS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nKimbrough. Neither is an acceptable sentencing practice.\n   In opposing Spears’ present petition for a writ of certio\nrari, the Government contends that the Eighth Circuit’s\nopinion stands only for the noncontroversial proposition\nthat a remand for resentencing was warranted in this case\nbecause the District Court did not properly consider all of\nthe §3553(a) sentencing factors. Brief in Opposition 12–\n13. But the Government did not present that argument\nbelow, and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion plainly did not rest\non that ground. It concluded instead that “the district\ncourt may not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the\nGuidelines.” Spears II, 533 F. 3d, at 717. The Eighth\nCircuit has since read its own opinion to mean what it\nsays, see United States v. Judon, 284 Fed. Appx. 371, 372\n(2008) (per curiam), and so do we. In any event, to the\nextent the District Court cut short its sentencing analysis,\nit did so only because it had already determined that a\nmandatory minimum sentence was required, thus mooting\nany further arguments for a reduced sentence. The deci\nsion not to entertain pointless arguments hardly consti\ntutes procedural error.\n   The dissent contends, post, at 1, that the Eighth Circuit\nrecognized Kimbrough’s core holding when it stated that\nin conducting “an individualized assessment based upon\nthe particular circumstances of a defendant’s case, a dis\ntrict court may determine the 100:1 quantity ratio results\nin a harsher sentence than necessary,” Spears II, supra,\nat 717. But that was not Kimbrough’s holding; it was the\nGovernment’s position in Kimbrough, which did not pre\nvail. And it is expressly contradicted by Kimbrough’s\nholding that district courts are entitled to vary from the\ncrack-cocaine guidelines in a mine-run case where there\nare no “particular circumstances” that would otherwise\njustify a variance from the Guidelines’ sentencing range.\n   The dissent believes that “[t]his petition involves the\narguably distinct issue whether district courts that do\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ndisagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines may\nadopt their own categorical crack-powder ratios in place of\nthe ratio set forth in the Guidelines.” Post, at 1. But that\nis in fact not distinct from the issue we addressed in\nKimbrough. To say that the judge who considers the 100:1\nratio excessive cannot apply a different ratio is to say that\nthe Kimbrough-sanctioned district-court disagreement\nwith the 100:1 ratio cannot honestly be given effect. It is\nabsurd to think that a sentence which is reasonable in\nlight of the statutory sentencing factors, see 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a), becomes unreasonable if the sentencing judge\nchooses to specify his disagreement, and the degree of his\ndisagreement, with the 100:1 ratio, which is the entire\nbasis for his Guidelines departure.\n   The dissent says that “Apprendi, Booker, Rita, Gall, and\nKimbrough have given the lower courts a good deal to\ndigest over a relatively short period.” Post, at 3. True\nenough—and we should therefore promptly remove from\nthe menu the Eighth Circuit’s offering, a smuggled-in dish\nthat is indigestible. Finally, the dissent points out that\nother courts have followed the Eighth Circuit’s course, see\nUnited States v. Russell, 537 F. 3d 6, 11 (CA1 2008);\nUnited States v. Gunter, 527 F. 3d 282, 286 (CA3 2008).\nBoth of those courts, like the Eighth Circuit, seized upon\nthe language from Kimbrough quoted above in order to\nstand by the course they had adopted pre-Kimbrough—\nand in the case of the First Circuit, despite this Court’s\nhaving vacated and remanded, in light of Kimbrough, the\nprior First Circuit judgment which had established that\ncourse. See Pho v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008). If\nthe error of those opinions is, as we think, evident, they\ndemonstrate the need to clarify at once the holding of\nKimbrough.\n                       *     *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\n8                SPEARS v.

The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY would grant the petition for a writ of\ncertiorari and set the case for oral argument.\n\n    JUSTICE THOMAS dissents.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08–5721. Decided January 21, 2009\n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO\njoins, dissenting.\n   I dissent from the Court’s summary reversal in this\ncase. As explained by the majority here and the dissent\ning judges below, there are cogent arguments that the\nEighth Circuit’s decision was contrary to our decision last\nTerm in Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).\nBut I do not think any error is so apparent as to warrant\nthe bitter medicine of summary reversal, and I think there\nare good reasons not to address the question presented at\nthis time.\n   In the decision below, the Court of Appeals recognized\nKimbrough’s core holding that district courts have author\nity to depart from the Guidelines based on policy concerns:\n“In considering the overall goals of sentencing under [18\nU. S. C.] §3553(a) and conducting an individualized as\nsessment based upon the particular circumstances of a\ndefendant’s case, a district court may determine the 100:1\nquantity ratio results in a harsher sentence than neces\nsary.” 533 F. 3d 715, 717 (CA8 2008). This petition in\nvolves the arguably distinct issue whether district courts\nthat do disagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines\nmay adopt their own categorical crack-powder ratios in\nplace of the ratio set forth in the Guidelines.\n   There is at least some language in Kimbrough that\nseems to support the Court of Appeals’ holding. In\nKimbrough, we noted with apparent approval that the\nDistrict Court “did not purport to establish a ratio of its\nown.” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (emphasis added).\n2                SPEARS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nRather, we held, the District Court “appropriately framed\nits final determination in line with §3553(a)’s overarching\ninstruction to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater\nthan necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals ad\nvanced in §3553(a)(2).” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Eighth\nCircuit’s interpretation of this language. See United\nStates v. Russell, 537 F. 3d 6, 11 (CA1 2008) (emphasizing\n“the importance of individualized, case-by-case sentencing\ndeterminations, rather than a reliance on generalized\nratios”); United States v. Gunter, 527 F. 3d 282, 286 (CA3\n2008) (“a district court may not employ a ‘rubber stamp’\napproach that categorically rejects the crack/powder dis\nparity without an individualized assessment of the\n§3553(a) factors”). The majority cites no circuit court\ndecision contrary to that of the Eighth Circuit in this case.\n   This is not the stuff of summary reversal. The majority\nmay well be correct that its holding today follows from\nKimbrough, but it is not clear to me that this result was\npart and parcel of the holding in that case, especially in\nlight of the language quoted above.\n   At the same time, I do not believe this case meets our\nnormal criteria for plenary consideration. As noted, there\nis no split in the lower courts on the question whether a\ndistrict court may replace the crack-powder ratio in the\nGuidelines with a categorical ratio of the court’s own\nchoosing. And, as explained above, I do not think the\nCourt of Appeals has “so far departed from the accepted\nand usual course of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for\nan exercise of this Court’s supervisory power.” S. Ct. Rule\n10(a). In other words, this is exactly the sort of issue that\ncould benefit from further attention in the courts of ap\npeals. We should not rush to answer a novel question\nabout the application of a one-year-old decision in the\nabsence of a pronounced conflict among the circuits.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  Apprendi, Booker, Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough have given\nthe lower courts a good deal to digest over a relatively\nshort period. We should give them some time to address\nthe nuances of these precedents before adding new ones.\nAs has been said, a plant cannot grow if you constantly\nyank it out of the ground to see if the roots are healthy.\n</pre>", "id": 145916, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/01/21/Spears_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                   Cite as: 555 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 2), and that “it would not be\nan abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when\nsentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder\ndisparity yields a sentence ‘greater than necessary’ to\nachieve §3553(a)’s purpose, even in a mine-run case,” id.,\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nat ___ (slip op., at 21) (emphasis added). The correct\ninterpretation of that holding is the one offered by the\ndissent in Spears II:\n    “The Court thus established that even when a particu\n    lar defendant in a crack cocaine case presents no spe\n    cial mitigating circumstances—no outstanding service\n    to country or community, no unusually disadvantaged\n    childhood, no overstated criminal history score, no\n    post-offense rehabilitation—a sentencing court may\n    nonetheless vary downward from the advisory guide\n    line range. The court may do so based solely on its\n    view that the 100-to-1 ratio embodied in the sentenc\n    ing guidelines for the treatment of crack cocaine ver\n    sus powder cocaine creates ‘an unwarranted disparity\n    within the meaning of §3553(a),’ and is ‘at odds with\n    §3553(a).’ The only fact necessary to justify such a\n    variance is the sentencing court’s disagreement with\n    the guidelines—its policy view that the 100-to-1 ratio\n    creates an unwarranted disparity.” 533 F. 3d, at 719\n    (opinion of Colloton, J.) (citations omitted).\n   Kimbrough considered and rejected the position taken\nby the Eighth Circuit below. It noted that “a district\ncourt’s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines may\nattract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a\nparticular case ‘outside the “heartland” to which the\nCommission intends individual Guidelines to apply.’ ” 552\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20–21) (quoting Rita v. United\nStates, 551 U. S. 338, 351 (2007)). The implication was\nthat an “inside the heartland” departure (which is neces\nsarily based on a policy disagreement with the Guidelines\nand necessarily disagrees on a “categorical basis”) may be\nentitled to less respect. Our opinion said, however, that\nthe “crack cocaine Guidelines . . . present no occasion for\nelaborative discussion of this matter because those Guide\nlines do not exemplify the Commission’s exercise of its\n4                SPEARS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharacteristic institutional role.” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 21). Kimbrough thus holds that with respect to the\ncrack cocaine Guidelines, a categorical disagreement with\nand variance from the Guidelines is not suspect.\n   That was indeed the point of Kimbrough: a recognition\nof district courts’ authority to vary from the crack cocaine\nGuidelines based on policy disagreement with them, and\nnot simply based on an individualized determination that\nthey yield an excessive sentence in a particular case. The\nlatter proposition was already established pre-Kimbrough,\nsee United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 245–246 (2005),\nand the Government conceded as much in Kimbrough.\n552 U. S., at ___, n. 13 (slip op., at 13, n. 13). That the\nGovernment did not prevail in Kimbrough proves that its\nconcession—“that a district court may vary from the 100:1\nratio if it does so ‘based on the individualized circum\nstance[s]’ of a particular case,” ibid.—understated the\nextent of district courts’ sentencing discretion.\n   In drawing a distinction between “individualized, case\nspecific” consideration of the Guidelines’ ratio and cate\ngorical rejection and replacement of that ratio, the Eighth\nCircuit relied in part, Spears II, supra, at 717, on the\nfollowing passage from Kimbrough:\n    “The [district] court did not purport to establish a ra\n    tio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final\n    determination in line with §3553(a)’s overarching in\n    struction to ‘impose a sentence sufficient, but not\n    greater than necessary’ to accomplish the sentencing\n    goals advanced in §3553(a)(2).” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip\n    op., at 22).\nThis says that it was “appropriate” for the District Court\nin Kimbrough not to specify what ratio it was using, but\nmerely to proceed with §3553(a) analysis. The Eighth\nCircuit read that to mean that district courts, in the\ncourse of their individualized determinations, may not\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ncategorically disagree with the Guidelines ratio, and (con\nsequently) may not substitute their own ratio for that of the\nGuidelines. If it meant that, our vacating of the Eighth\nCircuit’s judgment in Spears I would have been inexplica\nble, because that supposedly impermissible disagreement\nand substitution was precisely the reason for Spears I’s\nreversal of the District Court. See Spears I, 469 F. 3d, at\n1175–1176. As a logical matter, of course, rejection of the\n100:1 ratio, explicitly approved by Kimbrough, necessarily\nimplies adoption of some other ratio to govern the mine\nrun case. A sentencing judge who is given the power to\nreject the disparity created by the crack-to-powder ratio\nmust also possess the power to apply a different ratio\nwhich, in his judgment, corrects the disparity. Put simply,\nthe ability to reduce a mine-run defendant’s sentence\nnecessarily permits adoption of a replacement ratio.\n  To the extent the above quoted language has obscured\nKimbrough’s holding, we now clarify that district courts\nare entitled to reject and vary categorically from the crack\ncocaine Guidelines based on a policy disagreement with\nthose Guidelines. Here, the District Court’s choice of\nreplacement ratio was based upon two well-reasoned\ndecisions by other courts, which themselves reflected the\nSentencing Commission’s expert judgment that a 20:1\nratio would be appropriate in a mine-run case. See Perry,\n389 F. Supp. 2d, at 307–308; Smith, 359 F. Supp. 2d, at\n781–782; Report to Congress 106–107, App. A, pp. 3–6.\n  The alternative approach—adopted by the Eighth Cir\ncuit—would likely yield one of two results. Either district\ncourts would treat the Guidelines’ policy embodied in the\ncrack-to-powder ratio as mandatory, believing that they\nare not entitled to vary based on “categorical” policy dis\nagreements with the Guidelines, or they would continue to\nvary, masking their categorical policy disagreements as\n“individualized determinations.” The latter is institution\nalized subterfuge. The former contradicts our holding in\n6                SPEARS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nKimbrough. Neither is an acceptable sentencing practice.\n   In opposing Spears’ present petition for a writ of certio\nrari, the Government contends that the Eighth Circuit’s\nopinion stands only for the noncontroversial proposition\nthat a remand for resentencing was warranted in this case\nbecause the District Court did not properly consider all of\nthe §3553(a) sentencing factors. Brief in Opposition 12–\n13. But the Government did not present that argument\nbelow, and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion plainly did not rest\non that ground. It concluded instead that “the district\ncourt may not categorically reject the ratio set forth by the\nGuidelines.” Spears II, 533 F. 3d, at 717. The Eighth\nCircuit has since read its own opinion to mean what it\nsays, see United States v. Judon, 284 Fed. Appx. 371, 372\n(2008) (per curiam), and so do we. In any event, to the\nextent the District Court cut short its sentencing analysis,\nit did so only because it had already determined that a\nmandatory minimum sentence was required, thus mooting\nany further arguments for a reduced sentence. The deci\nsion not to entertain pointless arguments hardly consti\ntutes procedural error.\n   The dissent contends, post, at 1, that the Eighth Circuit\nrecognized Kimbrough’s core holding when it stated that\nin conducting “an individualized assessment based upon\nthe particular circumstances of a defendant’s case, a dis\ntrict court may determine the 100:1 quantity ratio results\nin a harsher sentence than necessary,” Spears II, supra,\nat 717. But that was not Kimbrough’s holding; it was the\nGovernment’s position in Kimbrough, which did not pre\nvail. And it is expressly contradicted by Kimbrough’s\nholding that district courts are entitled to vary from the\ncrack-cocaine guidelines in a mine-run case where there\nare no “particular circumstances” that would otherwise\njustify a variance from the Guidelines’ sentencing range.\n   The dissent believes that “[t]his petition involves the\narguably distinct issue whether district courts that do\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ndisagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines may\nadopt their own categorical crack-powder ratios in place of\nthe ratio set forth in the Guidelines.” Post, at 1. But that\nis in fact not distinct from the issue we addressed in\nKimbrough. To say that the judge who considers the 100:1\nratio excessive cannot apply a different ratio is to say that\nthe Kimbrough-sanctioned district-court disagreement\nwith the 100:1 ratio cannot honestly be given effect. It is\nabsurd to think that a sentence which is reasonable in\nlight of the statutory sentencing factors, see 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a), becomes unreasonable if the sentencing judge\nchooses to specify his disagreement, and the degree of his\ndisagreement, with the 100:1 ratio, which is the entire\nbasis for his Guidelines departure.\n   The dissent says that “Apprendi, Booker, Rita, Gall, and\nKimbrough have given the lower courts a good deal to\ndigest over a relatively short period.” Post, at 3. True\nenough—and we should therefore promptly remove from\nthe menu the Eighth Circuit’s offering, a smuggled-in dish\nthat is indigestible. Finally, the dissent points out that\nother courts have followed the Eighth Circuit’s course, see\nUnited States v. Russell, 537 F. 3d 6, 11 (CA1 2008);\nUnited States v. Gunter, 527 F. 3d 282, 286 (CA3 2008).\nBoth of those courts, like the Eighth Circuit, seized upon\nthe language from Kimbrough quoted above in order to\nstand by the course they had adopted pre-Kimbrough—\nand in the case of the First Circuit, despite this Court’s\nhaving vacated and remanded, in light of Kimbrough, the\nprior First Circuit judgment which had established that\ncourse. See Pho v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2008). If\nthe error of those opinions is, as we think, evident, they\ndemonstrate the need to clarify at once the holding of\nKimbrough.\n                       *     *    *\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\n8                SPEARS v.

UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08–5721. Decided January 21, 2009\n\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, with whom JUSTICE ALITO\njoins, dissenting.\n   I dissent from the Court’s summary reversal in this\ncase. As explained by the majority here and the dissent\ning judges below, there are cogent arguments that the\nEighth Circuit’s decision was contrary to our decision last\nTerm in Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. ___ (2007).\nBut I do not think any error is so apparent as to warrant\nthe bitter medicine of summary reversal, and I think there\nare good reasons not to address the question presented at\nthis time.\n   In the decision below, the Court of Appeals recognized\nKimbrough’s core holding that district courts have author\nity to depart from the Guidelines based on policy concerns:\n“In considering the overall goals of sentencing under [18\nU. S. C.] §3553(a) and conducting an individualized as\nsessment based upon the particular circumstances of a\ndefendant’s case, a district court may determine the 100:1\nquantity ratio results in a harsher sentence than neces\nsary.” 533 F. 3d 715, 717 (CA8 2008). This petition in\nvolves the arguably distinct issue whether district courts\nthat do disagree with the policy underlying the Guidelines\nmay adopt their own categorical crack-powder ratios in\nplace of the ratio set forth in the Guidelines.\n   There is at least some language in Kimbrough that\nseems to support the Court of Appeals’ holding. In\nKimbrough, we noted with apparent approval that the\nDistrict Court “did not purport to establish a ratio of its\nown.” 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (emphasis added).\n2                SPEARS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nRather, we held, the District Court “appropriately framed\nits final determination in line with §3553(a)’s overarching\ninstruction to impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater\nthan necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals ad\nvanced in §3553(a)(2).” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Eighth\nCircuit’s interpretation of this language. See United\nStates v. Russell, 537 F. 3d 6, 11 (CA1 2008) (emphasizing\n“the importance of individualized, case-by-case sentencing\ndeterminations, rather than a reliance on generalized\nratios”); United States v. Gunter, 527 F. 3d 282, 286 (CA3\n2008) (“a district court may not employ a ‘rubber stamp’\napproach that categorically rejects the crack/powder dis\nparity without an individualized assessment of the\n§3553(a) factors”). The majority cites no circuit court\ndecision contrary to that of the Eighth Circuit in this case.\n   This is not the stuff of summary reversal. The majority\nmay well be correct that its holding today follows from\nKimbrough, but it is not clear to me that this result was\npart and parcel of the holding in that case, especially in\nlight of the language quoted above.\n   At the same time, I do not believe this case meets our\nnormal criteria for plenary consideration. As noted, there\nis no split in the lower courts on the question whether a\ndistrict court may replace the crack-powder ratio in the\nGuidelines with a categorical ratio of the court’s own\nchoosing. And, as explained above, I do not think the\nCourt of Appeals has “so far departed from the accepted\nand usual course of judicial proceedings . . . as to call for\nan exercise of this Court’s supervisory power.” S. Ct. Rule\n10(a). In other words, this is exactly the sort of issue that\ncould benefit from further attention in the courts of ap\npeals. We should not rush to answer a novel question\nabout the application of a one-year-old decision in the\nabsence of a pronounced conflict among the circuits.\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  Apprendi, Booker, Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough have given\nthe lower courts a good deal to digest over a relatively\nshort period. We should give them some time to address\nthe nuances of these precedents before adding new ones.\nAs has been said, a plant cannot grow if you constantly\nyank it out of the ground to see if the roots are healthy.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/145916/", "sha1": "1c1346234193193407705b49534b82726078fca0", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2008-015", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-05T17:09:29"}
