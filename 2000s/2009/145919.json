KARASS, STATE CONTROLLER, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07\u2013610.     Argued October 6, 2008\u2014Decided January 21, 2009\nThe collective-bargaining agreement between Maine and respondent\n  local union, the exclusive bargaining agent for certain state employ\n  ees, requires nonmember employees represented by the union to pay\n  the local a \u201cservice fee\u201d equal to the portion of union dues related to\n  ordinary representational activities, e.g., collective bargaining or con\n  tract administration activities. That fee does not include noncharge\n  able union activities such as political, public relations, or lobbying ac\n  tivities. The fee includes a charge that represents the \u201caffiliation fee\u201d\n  the local pays to the national union. But, it covers only the part of\n  the affiliation fee that helps to pay for the national\u2019s own chargeable\n  activities, which include some litigation activities that directly bene\n  fit other locals or the national itself, rather than respondent local.\n  The petitioners, nonmembers of the local, brought this suit claiming,\n  inter alia, that the First Amendment prohibits charging them for any\n  portion of the service fee that represents litigation that does not di\n  rectly benefit the local, i.e., \u201cnational litigation.\u201d The District Court\n  found no material facts at issue and upheld this element of the fee.\n  The First Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Under this Court\u2019s precedent, the First Amendment permits a\n local union to charge nonmembers for national litigation expenses as\n long as (1) the subject matter of the (extra-local) litigation is of a kind\n that would be chargeable if the litigation were local, e.g., litigation\n appropriately related to collective bargaining rather than political ac\n tivities, and (2) the charge is reciprocal in nature, i.e., the contribut\n ing local reasonably expects other locals to contribute similarly to the\n national\u2019s resources used for costs of similar litigation on behalf of\n the contributing local if and when it takes place. Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) Prior decisions frame the question at issue. The Court has long\n2                           LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    held that the First Amendment permits local unions designated as\n    the exclusive bargaining representatives for certain employees to\n    charge nonmember employees a service fee as a condition of their\n    continued employment. With respect to litigation expenses, the\n    Court also held that a local could charge nonmembers for expenses of\n    litigation normally conducted by an exclusive representative, includ\n    ing litigation incidental to collective bargaining, but said (in language\n    that the petitioners here emphasize) that litigation expenses \u201cnot\n    having such connection with the bargaining unit are not to be\n    charged to objecting employees.\u201d Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S.\n    435, 453. Later, the Court held, with respect to the chargeability of a\n    local\u2019s payment of an affiliation fee to a national, that the local \u201cmay\n    charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs asso\n    ciated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\n    affiliates, even if those activities were not performed for the direct\n    benefit of the objecting employees\u2019 bargaining unit.\u201d Lehnert v. Ferris\n    Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524. The Court added that the local\n    unit need not \u201cdemonstrate a direct and tangible impact upon the\n    dissenting employee\u2019s unit,\u201d although there must be \u201csome indication\n    that the payment [say, to the national] is for services that may ulti\n    mately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by vir\n    tue of their membership in the parent organization.\u201d Ibid. However,\n    the Lehnert Court split into three irreconcilable factions on the sub\n    ject here at issue, payment for national litigation. Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (b) Because Lehnert failed to find a majority as to the chargeability\n    of national litigation expenses, the lower courts have been uncertain\n    about the matter. Having examined the question further, however,\n    the Court now believes that, consistent with its precedent, costs of\n    such litigation are chargeable provided the litigation meets the rele\n    vant standards for charging other national expenditures that the\n    Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards, a local may\n    charge a nonmember an appropriate share of its contribution to a na\n    tional\u2019s litigation expenses if (1) the subject matter of the national\n    litigation bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining and\n    (2) the arrangement is reciprocal\u2014that is, the local\u2019s payment to the\n    national affiliate is for \u201cservices that may ultimately inure to the\n    benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their member\n    ship in the parent organization.\u201d 500 U. S., at 524. Logic suggests\n    that the same standard should apply to national litigation expenses\n    as to other national expenses, and the Court can find no significant\n    difference between litigation activities and other national activities,\n    the cost of which this Court has found chargeable. The petitioners\u2019\n    arguments to the contrary, which rest primarily on their understand\n    ing of Ellis and Lehnert, are rejected. Pp. 9\u201311.\n                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n     (c) Applying Lehnert\u2019s standard to the national litigation expenses\n  at issue demonstrates that they are both appropriately related to col\n  lective bargaining activities and reciprocal, and are therefore charge\n  able. First, the record establishes that the kind of national litigation\n  activity for which the local charges nonmembers concerns only those\n  aspects of collective bargaining, contract administration, or other\n  matters that the courts have held chargeable. No one here denies\n  that under Lehnert this kind of activity bears an appropriate relation\n  to collective bargaining. See, e.g., 500 U. S., at 519. Second, al\n  though the location of the litigation activity is at the national (or ex\n  traunit) level, such activity is chargeable as long as the charges are\n  for services that may ultimately inure to local members\u2019 benefit by\n  virtue of their membership in the national union. Ibid. Respondent\n  local says that the payment of its affiliation fee gives locals in general\n  access to the national\u2019s financial resources\u2014compiled via contribu\n  tions from various locals\u2014which would not otherwise be available to\n  the local when needed to effectively negotiate, administer, or enforce\n  the local\u2019s collective-bargaining agreements. Because no one claims\n  that the national would treat respondent local any differently from\n  other locals in this regard, the existence of reciprocity is not in dis\n  pute.

LOCKE, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. EDWARD\n     A. KARASS, STATE CONTROLLER, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 21, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The State of Maine requires government employees to\npay a service fee to the local union that acts as their exclu\nsive bargaining agent even if those employees disagree\nwith, and do not belong to, the union. This Court has held\nthat, in principle, the government may require this kind of\npayment without violating the First Amendment. See,\ne.g., Railway Employes v. Hanson, 351 U. S. 225 (1956)\n(upholding such an arrangement as constitutional); Abood\nv. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977) (same); Lehnert\nv. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507 (1991) (same). At\nthe same time, the Court has considered the constitution\nality of charging for various elements of such a fee, up\nholding the charging of some elements (e.g., those related\nto administering a collective-bargaining contract) while\nforbidding the charging of other elements (e.g., those\nrelated to political expenditures). Compare, e.g., Ellis v.\nRailway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435 (1984), with Machinists v.\nStreet, 367 U. S. 740 (1961).\n   In this case, a local union charges nonmembers a service\nfee that (among other things) reflects an affiliation fee\n2                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the local union pays to its national union organiza\ntion. We focus upon one portion of that fee, a portion that\nthe national union uses to pay for litigation expenses\nincurred in large part on behalf of other local units. We\nask whether a local\u2019s charge to nonmembers that reflects\nthat element is consistent with the First Amendment.\nAnd we conclude that under our precedent the Constitu\ntion permits including this element in the local\u2019s charge to\nnonmembers as long as (1) the subject matter of the (ex\ntra-local) litigation is of a kind that would be chargeable if\nthe litigation were local, e.g., litigation appropriately\nrelated to collective bargaining rather than political activi\nties, and (2) the litigation charge is reciprocal in nature,\ni.e., the contributing local reasonably expects other locals\nto contribute similarly to the national\u2019s resources used for\ncosts of similar litigation on behalf of the contributing\nlocal if and when it takes place.\n                              I\n   Maine has designated the Maine State Employees\nAssociation (the local union) as the exclusive bargaining\nagent for certain executive branch employees. A collec\ntive-bargaining agreement between Maine and the local\nrequires nonmember employees whom the union repre\nsents to pay the local union a \u201cservice fee.\u201d And that\nservice fee equals that portion of ordinary union dues that\nis related to ordinary representational activities, e.g.,\ncollective bargaining or contract administration activities.\nIn calculating the fee, the union starts with ordinary\nunion dues and subtracts a sum representing the pro rata\ncost of nonchargeable union activities such as political,\npublic relations, or lobbying activities.\n   The service fee includes a charge that represents the\naffiliation fee the local pays to its national union, the\nService Employees International Union. The included\ncharge takes account of the affiliation fee, however, only\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninsofar as the fee helps to pay for the national\u2019s activities\nthat are of a chargeable kind, such as collective-bargaining\nor contract administration activities. The local does not\ncharge nonmembers for the portion of the affiliation fee\nthat helps pay for the national\u2019s activities of a kind that\nwould not normally be chargeable, such as political, public\nrelations, or lobbying activities.\n   The local includes in the chargeable portion of the\naffiliation fee an amount that helps the national pay for\nlitigation activities, some of which do not directly benefit\nMaine\u2019s state employees\u2019 local but rather directly benefit\nother locals or the national organization itself. (For pur\nposes of simplicity, we shall call all this extraunit litiga\ntion \u201cnational litigation.\u201d) As is true of all other parts of\nthe affiliation fee, the local\u2019s charge to nonmembers re\nflects these national litigation costs only insofar as the\nnational litigation concerns activities that are of a charge\nable kind. The local does not charge nonmembers for the\nportion of national litigation costs that concerns activities\nof a kind that would not normally be chargeable, such as\npolitical, public relations, or lobbying activities.\n   Numbers may help illustrate the scope of the issue. In\n2005, the full service fee the local charged nonmembers\namounted to about 49% of a member\u2019s ordinary union\ndues. (The petitioners here, beneficiaries of grandfather\ning rules, paid a half fee, amounting to about 24.5% of a\nmember\u2019s fee.) The full fee for employees like the petition\ners would have amounted to about $9.70 per month.\nAbout $1.34 per month of that $9.70 reflected a pro rata\nshare of the portion of the national affiliation fee that the\nlocal believed was chargeable. The portion of the $1.34\nper month affiliation fee charge that represented national\nlitigation costs\u2014the cost here at issue\u2014amounted to\nconsiderably less.\n   Although the amount at issue per nonmember may be\nsmall, nonmembers believed the principle important. And\n4                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin December 2005, nonmembers challenged in arbitration\nseveral aspects of the local\u2019s service fee, including the\nelement at issue here. In 2006, the arbitrator found all\naspects of the service fee lawful. Before the arbitrator\nreached his decision, however, the petitioners, who are\nnonmembers of the local union, brought this lawsuit in\nMaine\u2019s Federal District Court also challenging various\naspects of the service fee, including this element. In par\nticular, they claimed that the First Amendment prohibits\ncharging them for any portion of the service fee that\nrepresents what we have called \u201cnational litigation,\u201d i.e.,\nlitigation that does not directly benefit the local. The\nDistrict Court, finding no material facts at issue, upheld\nthis element of the fee. 425 F. Supp. 2d 137 (2006). The\nCourt of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s determination. 498 F. 3d 49 (2007). Because of\nuncertainty among the Circuits as to whether, or when,\nthe Constitution permits charging nonmembers for the\ncosts of national litigation, we granted certiorari. Com\npare Otto v. Pennsylvania State Educ. Assn.-NEA, 330 F.\n3d 125 (CA3 2003), with Pilots Against Illegal Dues v. Air\nLine Pilots Assn., 938 F. 2d 1123 (CA10 1991).\n                              II\n  Prior decisions of this Court frame the question before\nus. In Hanson, Street, and Abood, the Court set forth a\ngeneral First Amendment principle: The First Amendment\npermits the government to require both public sector and\nprivate sector employees who do not wish to join a union\ndesignated as the exclusive collective-bargaining represen\ntative at their unit of employment to pay that union a\nservice fee as a condition of their continued employment.\nTaken together, Hanson and Street make clear that the\nlocal union cannot charge the nonmember for certain\nactivities, such as political or ideological activities (with\nwhich the nonmembers may disagree). But under that\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent, the local can charge nonmembers for activities\nmore directly related to collective bargaining. In such\ninstances, the Court has determined that the First\nAmendment burdens accompanying the payment require\nment are justified by the government\u2019s interest in prevent\ning freeriding by nonmembers who benefit from the un\nion\u2019s collective-bargaining activities and in maintaining\npeaceful labor relations. Street, 367 U. S., at 768\u2013772;\nHanson, 351 U. S., at 233\u2013238.\n   In Abood, the Court explained the basis for a First\nAmendment challenge to service fees as follows: \u201cTo be\nrequired to help finance the union as a collective\nbargaining agent might well be thought . . . to interfere in\nsome way with an employee\u2019s freedom to associate for the\nadvancement of ideas, or to refrain from doing so, as he\nsees fit.\u201d 431 U. S., at 222. But the Abood Court rejected\nsuch a challenge. It found that, \u201cthe judgment clearly\nmade in Hanson and Street is that such interference as\nexists is constitutionally justified by the legislative as\nsessment of the important contribution of the union shop\nto the system of labor relations established by Congress.\u201d\nIbid. The Court added that, \u201c \u2018furtherance of the common\ncause leaves some leeway for the leadership of the group.\nAs long as they act to promote the cause which justified\nbringing the group together, the individual cannot with\ndraw his support merely because he disagrees with the\ngroup\u2019s strategy.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 223 (quoting Street, supra, at\n778 (Douglas, J., concurring)).\n   In Ellis and Lehnert, the Court refined the general\nFirst Amendment principle. In particular, it refined the\nboundaries of Abood\u2019s constitutional \u201cleeway\u201d by describ\ning the nature of the cost elements that the local, constitu\ntionally speaking, could include, or which the local could\nnot constitutionally include, in the service fee. In 1984,\nthe Court wrote in Ellis that service fees are constitution\nally permissible when they relate to the union\u2019s duties of\n6                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnegotiating and administering a collective agreement and\nin adjusting grievances and disputes.\u201d 466 U. S., at 446\u2013\n447 (citing Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U. S. 113, 121\n(1963)). Accordingly, the Court explained, the local union\ncould charge the nonmember for union \u201cexpenditures\n[that] are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the pur\npose of performing the duties of an exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in dealing with the employer on\nlabor-management issues.\u201d 446 U. S., at 448. In doing so,\nthe union could charge nonmembers for \u201cthe direct costs of\nnegotiating and administering a collective-bargaining\ncontract\u201d and for \u201cthe expenses of activities or undertak\nings normally or reasonably employed to implement or\neffectuate the duties of the union as exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in the bargaining unit.\u201d Ibid.\n   Applying this standard, the Ellis Court examined the\nparticular service fee charges challenged in that case. The\nCourt held that the local union could charge nonmembers\nfor the costs of a national convention, id., at 448\u2013449; for\nthe costs of social activities, id., at 449\u2013450; and for the\ncosts of those portions of publications not devoted to politi\ncal causes, id., at 450\u2013451. Convention expenses are\nchargeable, the Court explained, because, if a local union\nis to function effectively, \u201cit must maintain its corporate or\nassociational existence.\u201d Id., at 448.\n   The Court also held that the local union could charge\nnonmembers for litigation expenses incidental to the local\nunion\u2019s negotiation or administration of a collective\nbargaining agreement, fair representation litigation,\njurisdictional disputes, or other litigation normally con\nducted by an exclusive representative. Id., at 453. But\nthe Court then said (in language that the petitioners here\nemphasize) that \u201cexpenses of litigation not having such\nconnection with the bargaining unit are not to be charged\nto objecting employees.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   In 1991, the Court in Lehnert again described when an\n                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nexpense is chargeable. The Court said that a chargeable\nexpenditure must bear an appropriate relation to collec\ntive-bargaining activity. 500 U. S., at 519. (Its specific\ndescription of that relation is not at issue here. Compare\nibid., with id., at 557\u2013558 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\nment in part and dissenting in part)). The Court then\nconsidered one aspect of the matter here before us, the\nchargeability of a local union\u2019s payment to a national\norganization, say, an affiliation fee. The Court assumed\nthat, in any given year, such a payment would primarily\nbenefit other local units or the national organization itself,\nbut it would not necessarily provide a direct benefit to the\ncontributing local. The petitioners in the case (nonmem\nbers of a teacher\u2019s union) argued that the Constitution\nforbids a local union to charge nonmembers for these\nactivities, i.e., for \u201cactivities that, though closely related to\ncollective bargaining generally, are not undertaken di\nrectly on behalf of the bargaining unit to which the object\ning employees belong.\u201d Id., at 519.\n   The Court divided five to four on the general affiliation\nfee matter. The majority of the Court rejected the non\nmembers\u2019 claim. The Court noted that it had \u201cnever in\nterpreted\u201d the chargeability test \u201cto require a direct rela\ntionship between the expense at issue and some tangible\nbenefit to the dissenters\u2019 bargaining unit.\u201d Id., at 522.\nIndeed, \u201cto require so close a connection would be to ignore\nthe unified-membership structure under which many\nunions, including those here, operate.\u201d            Id., at 523.\nRather, the affiliation relationship is premised on the\n\u201cnotion that the parent will bring to bear its often consid\nerable economic, political, and informational resources\nwhen the local is in need of them.\u201d Ibid. And that \u201cpart of\na local\u2019s affiliation fee which contributes to the pool of\nresources potentially available to the local is assessed for\nthe bargaining unit\u2019s protection, even if it is not actually\nexpended on that unit in any particular membership\n8                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nyear.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court then held that \u201ca local bargaining represen\ntative may charge objecting employees for their pro rata\nshare of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable\nactivities of its state and national affiliates, even if those\nactivities were not performed for the direct benefit of the\nobjecting employees\u2019 bargaining unit.\u201d Id., at 524 (empha\nsis added). Of particular relevance here, the Court added\nthat the local unit need not \u201cdemonstrate a direct and\ntangible impact upon the dissenting employee\u2019s unit.\u201d\nNonetheless, it said, there must be \u201csome indication that\nthe payment [say, to the national affiliate] is for services\nthat may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of\nthe local union by virtue of their membership in the par\nent organization.\u201d Ibid.\n   Finally, the Lehnert Court turned to the subject now\nbefore us, that of payment for national litigation. On this\npoint, the Court split into three irreconcilable factions. A\nplurality of four wrote that, even though the union was\n\u201cclearly correct that precedent established through litiga\ntion on behalf of one unit may ultimately be of some use to\nanother unit,\u201d it nonetheless found \u201cextraunit litigation to\nbe more akin to lobbying in both kind and effect.\u201d Id., at\n528. The plurality added that litigation is often \u201cexpres\nsive.\u201d It concluded that \u201c[w]hen unrelated to an objecting\nemployee\u2019s unit, such activities are not germane to the\nunion\u2019s duties as exclusive bargaining representative.\u201d\nIbid.\n   The Member of the Court who provided the fifth vote for\nthe other portions of the Court\u2019s opinion dissented from\nthe part of the opinion on national litigation. Justice\nMarshall noted that the plurality\u2019s discussion of national\nlitigation costs was dicta because no such costs were at\nissue in the case. Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in part\nand dissenting in part). Nevertheless, Justice Marshall\ncharacterized any rule that found national litigation costs\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nper se nonchargeable as \u201csurely incorrect\u201d and indicated\nsuch costs should be assessed under the plurality\u2019s own\ntest, i.e., whether the litigation bears an appropriate\nrelation to collective bargaining. Id., at 546\u2013547.\n  At the same time, four Members of the Court agreed\nwith the nonmembers that including national costs in the\nservice fee violates the First Amendment except when\nthose costs pay for specific services \u201cactually provided\u201d to\nthe local. Id., at 561 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part). They thought that a local\nunion cannot charge nonmembers for national activities\nunless there is a direct relationship between the expenses\nand \u201csome tangible benefit to the dissenters\u2019 bargaining\nunit.\u201d Id., at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nother words, the dissent expressly rejected the majority\u2019s\nchargeability test for national expenses. But the dissent\ndid not separately discuss national litigation activities,\nperhaps because, as Justice Marshall pointed out, they\nwere not directly at issue in that case.\n                              III\n   As a result of the Lehnert Court\u2019s failure to find a ma\njority as to the chargeability of national litigation ex\npenses, the lower courts have been uncertain about the\nmatter. Compare Otto, 330 F. 3d, at 138, with Pilots\nAgainst Illegal Dues, 938 F. 2d, at 1130\u20131131. Having\nexamined the question further, we now believe that, con\nsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, costs of that litigation\nare chargeable provided the litigation meets the relevant\nstandards for charging other national expenditures that\nthe Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards,\na local union may charge a nonmember an appropriate\nshare of its contribution to a national\u2019s litigation expenses\nif (1) the subject matter of the national litigation bears an\nappropriate relation to collective bargaining and (2) the\narrangement is reciprocal\u2014that is, the local\u2019s payment to\n10                    LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe national affiliate is for \u201cservices that may ultimately\ninure to the benefit of the members of the local union by\nvirtue of their membership in the parent organization.\u201d\n500 U. S., at 524.\n   We reach this conclusion in part because logic suggests\nthat the same standard should apply to national litigation\nexpenses as to other national expenses. We can find no\nsignificant difference between litigation activities and\nother national activities the cost of which this Court has\nfound chargeable. We can find no sound basis for holding\nthat national social activities, national convention activi\nties, and activities involved in producing the nonpolitical\nportions of national union publications all are chargeable\nbut national litigation activities are not. See Ellis, 466\nU. S., at 448\u2013451. Of course, a local nonmember pre\nsumably has the right to attend, and consequently can\ndirectly benefit from, national social and convention ac\ntivities; and a local nonmember can read, and benefit\nfrom, a national publication. But so can a local nonmem\nber benefit from national litigation aimed at helping other\nunits if the national or those other units will similarly\ncontribute to the cost of litigation on the local union\u2019s\nbehalf should the need arise.\n   The petitioners\u2019 arguments to the contrary rest primar\nily upon their understanding of Ellis and Lehnert. Ellis,\nwe must concede, sets forth certain kinds of national\nlitigation\u2014for the most part directly related to a local\nunion\u2019s particular interests\u2014as chargeable; but it then\ngoes on to say, as we have earlier pointed out, ante, at 6\u20137,\nthat \u201cexpenses of litigation not having such a connection\nwith the bargaining unit are not to be charged to objecting\nemployees.\u201d 466 U. S., at 453. Nonetheless, as the Court\nof Appeals noted, the Ellis Court focused upon a local\nunion\u2019s payment of national litigation expenses without\nany understanding as to reciprocity. Indeed, JUSTICE\nKENNEDY pointed out in his Lehnert dissent, \u201cEllis . . .\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontains no discussion of whether a bargaining unit might\nchoose to fund litigation . . . through a cost sharing ar\nrangement under the auspices of the affiliate.\u201d 500 U. S.,\nat 564 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis\nsenting in part). Ellis nowhere explains why reciprocal\nlitigation funding arrangements would fail to benefit a\nlocal union. Hence, Ellis does not answer the question\npresented here.\n   We must also concede that a plurality in Lehnert wrote\nthat national litigation expenses were not chargeable\n\u201c[w]hen unrelated to an objecting employee\u2019s unit.\u201d 500\nU. S., at 528. But, again, reciprocal litigation funding was\nnot before the Court; hence the plurality could not (and\ndid not) decide whether an understanding as to reciprocity\nproduced the relationship necessary for chargeability.\nRegardless, a plurality does not speak for the Court as a\nwhole.\n   Nor can one simply add together the four Lehnert dis\nsenters and the four Members of the plurality in an effort\nto find a majority of Justices who hold the petitioners\u2019\nview. That is because the Lehnert majority, speaking for\nthe Court, adopted a more liberal standard of charge\nability than the standard embraced by the dissent. And\nthe question here is whether that standard permits charg\ning nonmembers for national litigation expenses. There\nwas no majority agreement in Lehnert about the answer to\nthis last mentioned question. The best we can do for the\npetitioners is to find Lehnert ambiguous on the point at\nissue.\n                             IV\n   Applying Lehnert\u2019s standard to the national litigation\nexpenses here at issue, we find them chargeable. First,\nthe kind of national litigation activity for which the local\ncharges nonmembers concerns only those aspects of collec\ntive bargaining, contract administration, or other matters\n12                   LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the courts have held chargeable. Ellis, supra, at 446\u2013\n447. The lower courts found (and the petitioners here do\nnot dispute) that the local charges nonmembers only for\nthose national litigation activities that, in respect to sub\nject matter, \u201cwere comparable to those undertaken\u201d by the\nlocal and which the local \u201cdeemed chargeable\u201d in its calcu\nlation of the \u201cservice fee.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 52, 64\u201365. And no\none here denies that under Lehnert this kind of activity\nbears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining.\nSee, e.g., Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 519; see also id., at 524\n(\u201c[A] local bargaining representative may charge objecting\nemployees for their pro rata share of costs associated with\notherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\naffiliates . . . \u201d).\n   Second, the location of the litigation activity is at the\nnational (or extraunit), not the local, level. But, as we\nhave just said (under Lehnert), activity at the national\nlevel is chargeable as long as the charges in question are\n\u201cfor services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of\nthe members of the local union by virtue of their member\nship in the parent organization.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals treated the litigation charge at\nissue as reciprocal in nature, and concluded the District\nCourt must have done so as well. See 498 F. 3d, at 64\u201365.\nThe local union here says that the payment of its affilia\ntion fee gives locals in general access to the national\u2019s\nfinancial resources\u2014compiled via contributions from\nvarious locals\u2014\u201cwhich would not otherwise be available to\nthe local union when needed to effectively negotiate, ad\nminister or enforce the local\u2019s collective bargaining agree\nments.\u201d Brief for Respondents 18\u201319. The resources in\nquestion include resources related to litigation. No one\nclaims that the national would treat the local union before\nus any differently, in terms of making these resources\navailable, than the national would treat any other local.\nThe petitioners do not suggest the contrary. And we\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconsequently conclude, as did the lower courts, that the\nexistence of reciprocity is assumed by the parties and not\nhere in dispute.\n   The record then leads us to find that the national litiga\ntion expenses before us are both appropriately related to\ncollective bargaining and reciprocal. Consequently, con\nsistent with our precedent, those expenses are chargeable.\nThe similar determination of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Petitioners have\ntaken an all-or-nothing position, contending that non\nmembers of a local may never be assessed for any portion\nof the national\u2019s extraunit litigation expenses.

The opinion correctly concludes,\n\u201cas did the lower courts, that the existence of reciprocity is\nassumed by the parties and not here in dispute.\u201d Ante, at\n13.\n   Thus, this case does not require us to address what is\nmeant by a charge being \u201creciprocal in nature,\u201d or what\nshowing is required to establish that services \u201c \u2018may ulti\nmately inure to the benefit of the members of the local\nunion by virtue of their membership in the parent organi\nzation.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12 (citing Lehnert v.

Once nonmembers\nobject to a charge, the Government submits, the union\nmust prove that the challenged expenditure was made\npursuant to an arrangement that is akin to an insurance\npolicy.

This is necessary, the Government\ncontends, to ensure that a charge is in fact \u201creciprocal in\nnature.\u201d\n   Because important First Amendment rights are at\nstake, the Government\u2019s argument regarding the burden\nof establishing true reciprocity has considerable force.\nNonetheless, since petitioners in this case did not raise the\nquestion whether the Maine State Employees Associa\ntion\u2019s pooling arrangement was bona fide, we need not\nreach that question today.\n",

Argued October 6, 2008\u2014Decided January 21, 2009\nThe collective-bargaining agreement between Maine and respondent\n  local union, the exclusive bargaining agent for certain state employ\n  ees, requires nonmember employees represented by the union to pay\n  the local a \u201cservice fee\u201d equal to the portion of union dues related to\n  ordinary representational activities, e.g., collective bargaining or con\n  tract administration activities. That fee does not include noncharge\n  able union activities such as political, public relations, or lobbying ac\n  tivities. The fee includes a charge that represents the \u201caffiliation fee\u201d\n  the local pays to the national union. But, it covers only the part of\n  the affiliation fee that helps to pay for the national\u2019s own chargeable\n  activities, which include some litigation activities that directly bene\n  fit other locals or the national itself, rather than respondent local.\n  The petitioners, nonmembers of the local, brought this suit claiming,\n  inter alia, that the First Amendment prohibits charging them for any\n  portion of the service fee that represents litigation that does not di\n  rectly benefit the local, i.e., \u201cnational litigation.\u201d The District Court\n  found no material facts at issue and upheld this element of the fee.\n  The First Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Under this Court\u2019s precedent, the First Amendment permits a\n local union to charge nonmembers for national litigation expenses as\n long as (1) the subject matter of the (extra-local) litigation is of a kind\n that would be chargeable if the litigation were local, e.g., litigation\n appropriately related to collective bargaining rather than political ac\n tivities, and (2) the charge is reciprocal in nature, i.e., the contribut\n ing local reasonably expects other locals to contribute similarly to the\n national\u2019s resources used for costs of similar litigation on behalf of\n the contributing local if and when it takes place. Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) Prior decisions frame the question at issue. The Court has long\n2                           LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    held that the First Amendment permits local unions designated as\n    the exclusive bargaining representatives for certain employees to\n    charge nonmember employees a service fee as a condition of their\n    continued employment. With respect to litigation expenses, the\n    Court also held that a local could charge nonmembers for expenses of\n    litigation normally conducted by an exclusive representative, includ\n    ing litigation incidental to collective bargaining, but said (in language\n    that the petitioners here emphasize) that litigation expenses \u201cnot\n    having such connection with the bargaining unit are not to be\n    charged to objecting employees.\u201d Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S.\n    435, 453. Later, the Court held, with respect to the chargeability of a\n    local\u2019s payment of an affiliation fee to a national, that the local \u201cmay\n    charge objecting employees for their pro rata share of the costs asso\n    ciated with otherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\n    affiliates, even if those activities were not performed for the direct\n    benefit of the objecting employees\u2019 bargaining unit.\u201d Lehnert v. Ferris\n    Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507, 524. The Court added that the local\n    unit need not \u201cdemonstrate a direct and tangible impact upon the\n    dissenting employee\u2019s unit,\u201d although there must be \u201csome indication\n    that the payment [say, to the national] is for services that may ulti\n    mately inure to the benefit of the members of the local union by vir\n    tue of their membership in the parent organization.\u201d Ibid. However,\n    the Lehnert Court split into three irreconcilable factions on the sub\n    ject here at issue, payment for national litigation. Pp. 4\u20139.\n       (b) Because Lehnert failed to find a majority as to the chargeability\n    of national litigation expenses, the lower courts have been uncertain\n    about the matter. Having examined the question further, however,\n    the Court now believes that, consistent with its precedent, costs of\n    such litigation are chargeable provided the litigation meets the rele\n    vant standards for charging other national expenditures that the\n    Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards, a local may\n    charge a nonmember an appropriate share of its contribution to a na\n    tional\u2019s litigation expenses if (1) the subject matter of the national\n    litigation bears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining and\n    (2) the arrangement is reciprocal\u2014that is, the local\u2019s payment to the\n    national affiliate is for \u201cservices that may ultimately inure to the\n    benefit of the members of the local union by virtue of their member\n    ship in the parent organization.\u201d 500 U. S., at 524. Logic suggests\n    that the same standard should apply to national litigation expenses\n    as to other national expenses, and the Court can find no significant\n    difference between litigation activities and other national activities,\n    the cost of which this Court has found chargeable. The petitioners\u2019\n    arguments to the contrary, which rest primarily on their understand\n    ing of Ellis and Lehnert, are rejected. Pp. 9\u201311.\n                      Cite as: 555 U.

First, the record establishes that the kind of national litigation\n  activity for which the local charges nonmembers concerns only those\n  aspects of collective bargaining, contract administration, or other\n  matters that the courts have held chargeable. No one here denies\n  that under Lehnert this kind of activity bears an appropriate relation\n  to collective bargaining. See, e.g., 500 U. S., at 519. Second, al\n  though the location of the litigation activity is at the national (or ex\n  traunit) level, such activity is chargeable as long as the charges are\n  for services that may ultimately inure to local members\u2019 benefit by\n  virtue of their membership in the national union. Ibid. Respondent\n  local says that the payment of its affiliation fee gives locals in general\n  access to the national\u2019s financial resources\u2014compiled via contribu\n  tions from various locals\u2014which would not otherwise be available to\n  the local when needed to effectively negotiate, administer, or enforce\n  the local\u2019s collective-bargaining agreements. Because no one claims\n  that the national would treat respondent local any differently from\n  other locals in this regard, the existence of reciprocity is not in dis\n  pute.

KARASS, STATE CONTROLLER, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 21, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The State of Maine requires government employees to\npay a service fee to the local union that acts as their exclu\nsive bargaining agent even if those employees disagree\nwith, and do not belong to, the union. This Court has held\nthat, in principle, the government may require this kind of\npayment without violating the First Amendment. See,\ne.g., Railway Employes v. Hanson, 351 U. S. 225 (1956)\n(upholding such an arrangement as constitutional); Abood\nv. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977) (same); Lehnert\nv. Ferris Faculty Assn., 500 U. S. 507 (1991) (same). At\nthe same time, the Court has considered the constitution\nality of charging for various elements of such a fee, up\nholding the charging of some elements (e.g., those related\nto administering a collective-bargaining contract) while\nforbidding the charging of other elements (e.g., those\nrelated to political expenditures). Compare, e.g., Ellis v.\nRailway Clerks, 466 U. S. 435 (1984), with Machinists v.\nStreet, 367 U. S. 740 (1961).\n   In this case, a local union charges nonmembers a service\nfee that (among other things) reflects an affiliation fee\n2                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the local union pays to its national union organiza\ntion. We focus upon one portion of that fee, a portion that\nthe national union uses to pay for litigation expenses\nincurred in large part on behalf of other local units. We\nask whether a local\u2019s charge to nonmembers that reflects\nthat element is consistent with the First Amendment.\nAnd we conclude that under our precedent the Constitu\ntion permits including this element in the local\u2019s charge to\nnonmembers as long as (1) the subject matter of the (ex\ntra-local) litigation is of a kind that would be chargeable if\nthe litigation were local, e.g., litigation appropriately\nrelated to collective bargaining rather than political activi\nties, and (2) the litigation charge is reciprocal in nature,\ni.e., the contributing local reasonably expects other locals\nto contribute similarly to the national\u2019s resources used for\ncosts of similar litigation on behalf of the contributing\nlocal if and when it takes place.\n                              I\n   Maine has designated the Maine State Employees\nAssociation (the local union) as the exclusive bargaining\nagent for certain executive branch employees. A collec\ntive-bargaining agreement between Maine and the local\nrequires nonmember employees whom the union repre\nsents to pay the local union a \u201cservice fee.\u201d And that\nservice fee equals that portion of ordinary union dues that\nis related to ordinary representational activities, e.g.,\ncollective bargaining or contract administration activities.\nIn calculating the fee, the union starts with ordinary\nunion dues and subtracts a sum representing the pro rata\ncost of nonchargeable union activities such as political,\npublic relations, or lobbying activities.\n   The service fee includes a charge that represents the\naffiliation fee the local pays to its national union, the\nService Employees International Union. The included\ncharge takes account of the affiliation fee, however, only\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninsofar as the fee helps to pay for the national\u2019s activities\nthat are of a chargeable kind, such as collective-bargaining\nor contract administration activities. The local does not\ncharge nonmembers for the portion of the affiliation fee\nthat helps pay for the national\u2019s activities of a kind that\nwould not normally be chargeable, such as political, public\nrelations, or lobbying activities.\n   The local includes in the chargeable portion of the\naffiliation fee an amount that helps the national pay for\nlitigation activities, some of which do not directly benefit\nMaine\u2019s state employees\u2019 local but rather directly benefit\nother locals or the national organization itself. (For pur\nposes of simplicity, we shall call all this extraunit litiga\ntion \u201cnational litigation.\u201d) As is true of all other parts of\nthe affiliation fee, the local\u2019s charge to nonmembers re\nflects these national litigation costs only insofar as the\nnational litigation concerns activities that are of a charge\nable kind. The local does not charge nonmembers for the\nportion of national litigation costs that concerns activities\nof a kind that would not normally be chargeable, such as\npolitical, public relations, or lobbying activities.\n   Numbers may help illustrate the scope of the issue. In\n2005, the full service fee the local charged nonmembers\namounted to about 49% of a member\u2019s ordinary union\ndues. (The petitioners here, beneficiaries of grandfather\ning rules, paid a half fee, amounting to about 24.5% of a\nmember\u2019s fee.) The full fee for employees like the petition\ners would have amounted to about $9.70 per month.\nAbout $1.34 per month of that $9.70 reflected a pro rata\nshare of the portion of the national affiliation fee that the\nlocal believed was chargeable. The portion of the $1.34\nper month affiliation fee charge that represented national\nlitigation costs\u2014the cost here at issue\u2014amounted to\nconsiderably less.\n   Although the amount at issue per nonmember may be\nsmall, nonmembers believed the principle important. And\n4                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin December 2005, nonmembers challenged in arbitration\nseveral aspects of the local\u2019s service fee, including the\nelement at issue here. In 2006, the arbitrator found all\naspects of the service fee lawful. Before the arbitrator\nreached his decision, however, the petitioners, who are\nnonmembers of the local union, brought this lawsuit in\nMaine\u2019s Federal District Court also challenging various\naspects of the service fee, including this element. In par\nticular, they claimed that the First Amendment prohibits\ncharging them for any portion of the service fee that\nrepresents what we have called \u201cnational litigation,\u201d i.e.,\nlitigation that does not directly benefit the local. The\nDistrict Court, finding no material facts at issue, upheld\nthis element of the fee. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2481467\"><a href=\"/opinion/2481467/locke-v-karass/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The\nCourt of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s determination. 498 F. 3d 49 (2007). Because of\nuncertainty among the Circuits as to whether, or when,\nthe Constitution permits charging nonmembers for the\ncosts of national litigation, we granted certiorari. Com\npare Otto v. Pennsylvania State Educ. Assn.-NEA, 330 F.\n3d 125 (CA3 2003), with Pilots Against Illegal Dues v. Air\nLine Pilots Assn., 938 F. 2d 1123 (CA10 1991).\n                              II\n  Prior decisions of this Court frame the question before\nus. In Hanson, Street, and Abood, the Court set forth a\ngeneral First Amendment principle: The First Amendment\npermits the government to require both public sector and\nprivate sector employees who do not wish to join a union\ndesignated as the exclusive collective-bargaining represen\ntative at their unit of employment to pay that union a\nservice fee as a condition of their continued employment.\nTaken together, Hanson and Street make clear that the\nlocal union cannot charge the nonmember for certain\nactivities, such as political or ideological activities (with\nwhich the nonmembers may disagree). But under that\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent, the local can charge nonmembers for activities\nmore directly related to collective bargaining. In such\ninstances, the Court has determined that the First\nAmendment burdens accompanying the payment require\nment are justified by the government\u2019s interest in prevent\ning freeriding by nonmembers who benefit from the un\nion\u2019s collective-bargaining activities and in maintaining\npeaceful labor relations. Street, 367 U. S., at 768\u2013772;\nHanson, 351 U. S., at 233\u2013238.\n   In Abood, the Court explained the basis for a First\nAmendment challenge to service fees as follows: \u201cTo be\nrequired to help finance the union as a collective\nbargaining agent might well be thought . . . to interfere in\nsome way with an employee\u2019s freedom to associate for the\nadvancement of ideas, or to refrain from doing so, as he\nsees fit.\u201d 431 U. S., at 222. But the Abood Court rejected\nsuch a challenge. It found that, \u201cthe judgment clearly\nmade in Hanson and Street is that such interference as\nexists is constitutionally justified by the legislative as\nsessment of the important contribution of the union shop\nto the system of labor relations established by Congress.\u201d\nIbid. The Court added that, \u201c \u2018furtherance of the common\ncause leaves some leeway for the leadership of the group.\nAs long as they act to promote the cause which justified\nbringing the group together, the individual cannot with\ndraw his support merely because he disagrees with the\ngroup\u2019s strategy.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 223 (quoting Street, supra, at\n778 (Douglas, J., concurring)).\n   In Ellis and Lehnert, the Court refined the general\nFirst Amendment principle. In particular, it refined the\nboundaries of Abood\u2019s constitutional \u201cleeway\u201d by describ\ning the nature of the cost elements that the local, constitu\ntionally speaking, could include, or which the local could\nnot constitutionally include, in the service fee. In 1984,\nthe Court wrote in Ellis that service fees are constitution\nally permissible when they relate to the union\u2019s duties of\n6                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnegotiating and administering a collective agreement and\nin adjusting grievances and disputes.\u201d 466 U. S., at 446\u2013\n447 (citing Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U. S. 113, 121\n(1963)). Accordingly, the Court explained, the local union\ncould charge the nonmember for union \u201cexpenditures\n[that] are necessarily or reasonably incurred for the pur\npose of performing the duties of an exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in dealing with the employer on\nlabor-management issues.\u201d 446 U. S., at 448. In doing so,\nthe union could charge nonmembers for \u201cthe direct costs of\nnegotiating and administering a collective-bargaining\ncontract\u201d and for \u201cthe expenses of activities or undertak\nings normally or reasonably employed to implement or\neffectuate the duties of the union as exclusive representa\ntive of the employees in the bargaining unit.\u201d Ibid.\n   Applying this standard, the Ellis Court examined the\nparticular service fee charges challenged in that case. The\nCourt held that the local union could charge nonmembers\nfor the costs of a national convention, id., at 448\u2013449; for\nthe costs of social activities, id., at 449\u2013450; and for the\ncosts of those portions of publications not devoted to politi\ncal causes, id., at 450\u2013451. Convention expenses are\nchargeable, the Court explained, because, if a local union\nis to function effectively, \u201cit must maintain its corporate or\nassociational existence.\u201d Id., at 448.\n   The Court also held that the local union could charge\nnonmembers for litigation expenses incidental to the local\nunion\u2019s negotiation or administration of a collective\nbargaining agreement, fair representation litigation,\njurisdictional disputes, or other litigation normally con\nducted by an exclusive representative. Id., at 453. But\nthe Court then said (in language that the petitioners here\nemphasize) that \u201cexpenses of litigation not having such\nconnection with the bargaining unit are not to be charged\nto objecting employees.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   In 1991, the Court in Lehnert again described when an\n                   Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nexpense is chargeable. The Court said that a chargeable\nexpenditure must bear an appropriate relation to collec\ntive-bargaining activity. 500 U. S., at 519. (Its specific\ndescription of that relation is not at issue here. Compare\nibid., with id., at 557\u2013558 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\nment in part and dissenting in part)). The Court then\nconsidered one aspect of the matter here before us, the\nchargeability of a local union\u2019s payment to a national\norganization, say, an affiliation fee. The Court assumed\nthat, in any given year, such a payment would primarily\nbenefit other local units or the national organization itself,\nbut it would not necessarily provide a direct benefit to the\ncontributing local. The petitioners in the case (nonmem\nbers of a teacher\u2019s union) argued that the Constitution\nforbids a local union to charge nonmembers for these\nactivities, i.e., for \u201cactivities that, though closely related to\ncollective bargaining generally, are not undertaken di\nrectly on behalf of the bargaining unit to which the object\ning employees belong.\u201d Id., at 519.\n   The Court divided five to four on the general affiliation\nfee matter. The majority of the Court rejected the non\nmembers\u2019 claim. The Court noted that it had \u201cnever in\nterpreted\u201d the chargeability test \u201cto require a direct rela\ntionship between the expense at issue and some tangible\nbenefit to the dissenters\u2019 bargaining unit.\u201d Id., at 522.\nIndeed, \u201cto require so close a connection would be to ignore\nthe unified-membership structure under which many\nunions, including those here, operate.\u201d            Id., at 523.\nRather, the affiliation relationship is premised on the\n\u201cnotion that the parent will bring to bear its often consid\nerable economic, political, and informational resources\nwhen the local is in need of them.\u201d Ibid. And that \u201cpart of\na local\u2019s affiliation fee which contributes to the pool of\nresources potentially available to the local is assessed for\nthe bargaining unit\u2019s protection, even if it is not actually\nexpended on that unit in any particular membership\n8                     LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nyear.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court then held that \u201ca local bargaining represen\ntative may charge objecting employees for their pro rata\nshare of the costs associated with otherwise chargeable\nactivities of its state and national affiliates, even if those\nactivities were not performed for the direct benefit of the\nobjecting employees\u2019 bargaining unit.\u201d Id., at 524 (empha\nsis added). Of particular relevance here, the Court added\nthat the local unit need not \u201cdemonstrate a direct and\ntangible impact upon the dissenting employee\u2019s unit.\u201d\nNonetheless, it said, there must be \u201csome indication that\nthe payment [say, to the national affiliate] is for services\nthat may ultimately inure to the benefit of the members of\nthe local union by virtue of their membership in the par\nent organization.\u201d Ibid.\n   Finally, the Lehnert Court turned to the subject now\nbefore us, that of payment for national litigation. On this\npoint, the Court split into three irreconcilable factions. A\nplurality of four wrote that, even though the union was\n\u201cclearly correct that precedent established through litiga\ntion on behalf of one unit may ultimately be of some use to\nanother unit,\u201d it nonetheless found \u201cextraunit litigation to\nbe more akin to lobbying in both kind and effect.\u201d Id., at\n528. The plurality added that litigation is often \u201cexpres\nsive.\u201d It concluded that \u201c[w]hen unrelated to an objecting\nemployee\u2019s unit, such activities are not germane to the\nunion\u2019s duties as exclusive bargaining representative.\u201d\nIbid.\n   The Member of the Court who provided the fifth vote for\nthe other portions of the Court\u2019s opinion dissented from\nthe part of the opinion on national litigation. Justice\nMarshall noted that the plurality\u2019s discussion of national\nlitigation costs was dicta because no such costs were at\nissue in the case. Id., at 544 (opinion concurring in part\nand dissenting in part). Nevertheless, Justice Marshall\ncharacterized any rule that found national litigation costs\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nper se nonchargeable as \u201csurely incorrect\u201d and indicated\nsuch costs should be assessed under the plurality\u2019s own\ntest, i.e., whether the litigation bears an appropriate\nrelation to collective bargaining. Id., at 546\u2013547.\n  At the same time, four Members of the Court agreed\nwith the nonmembers that including national costs in the\nservice fee violates the First Amendment except when\nthose costs pay for specific services \u201cactually provided\u201d to\nthe local. Id., at 561 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\nin part and dissenting in part). They thought that a local\nunion cannot charge nonmembers for national activities\nunless there is a direct relationship between the expenses\nand \u201csome tangible benefit to the dissenters\u2019 bargaining\nunit.\u201d Id., at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nother words, the dissent expressly rejected the majority\u2019s\nchargeability test for national expenses. But the dissent\ndid not separately discuss national litigation activities,\nperhaps because, as Justice Marshall pointed out, they\nwere not directly at issue in that case.\n                              III\n   As a result of the Lehnert Court\u2019s failure to find a ma\njority as to the chargeability of national litigation ex\npenses, the lower courts have been uncertain about the\nmatter. Compare Otto, 330 F. 3d, at 138, with Pilots\nAgainst Illegal Dues, 938 F. 2d, at 1130\u20131131. Having\nexamined the question further, we now believe that, con\nsistent with the Court\u2019s precedent, costs of that litigation\nare chargeable provided the litigation meets the relevant\nstandards for charging other national expenditures that\nthe Lehnert majority enunciated. Under those standards,\na local union may charge a nonmember an appropriate\nshare of its contribution to a national\u2019s litigation expenses\nif (1) the subject matter of the national litigation bears an\nappropriate relation to collective bargaining and (2) the\narrangement is reciprocal\u2014that is, the local\u2019s payment to\n10                    LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe national affiliate is for \u201cservices that may ultimately\ninure to the benefit of the members of the local union by\nvirtue of their membership in the parent organization.\u201d\n500 U. S., at 524.\n   We reach this conclusion in part because logic suggests\nthat the same standard should apply to national litigation\nexpenses as to other national expenses. We can find no\nsignificant difference between litigation activities and\nother national activities the cost of which this Court has\nfound chargeable. We can find no sound basis for holding\nthat national social activities, national convention activi\nties, and activities involved in producing the nonpolitical\nportions of national union publications all are chargeable\nbut national litigation activities are not. See Ellis, 466\nU. S., at 448\u2013451. Of course, a local nonmember pre\nsumably has the right to attend, and consequently can\ndirectly benefit from, national social and convention ac\ntivities; and a local nonmember can read, and benefit\nfrom, a national publication. But so can a local nonmem\nber benefit from national litigation aimed at helping other\nunits if the national or those other units will similarly\ncontribute to the cost of litigation on the local union\u2019s\nbehalf should the need arise.\n   The petitioners\u2019 arguments to the contrary rest primar\nily upon their understanding of Ellis and Lehnert. Ellis,\nwe must concede, sets forth certain kinds of national\nlitigation\u2014for the most part directly related to a local\nunion\u2019s particular interests\u2014as chargeable; but it then\ngoes on to say, as we have earlier pointed out, ante, at 6\u20137,\nthat \u201cexpenses of litigation not having such a connection\nwith the bargaining unit are not to be charged to objecting\nemployees.\u201d 466 U. S., at 453. Nonetheless, as the Court\nof Appeals noted, the Ellis Court focused upon a local\nunion\u2019s payment of national litigation expenses without\nany understanding as to reciprocity. Indeed, JUSTICE\nKENNEDY pointed out in his Lehnert dissent, \u201cEllis . . .\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncontains no discussion of whether a bargaining unit might\nchoose to fund litigation . . . through a cost sharing ar\nrangement under the auspices of the affiliate.\u201d 500 U. S.,\nat 564 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dis\nsenting in part). Ellis nowhere explains why reciprocal\nlitigation funding arrangements would fail to benefit a\nlocal union. Hence, Ellis does not answer the question\npresented here.\n   We must also concede that a plurality in Lehnert wrote\nthat national litigation expenses were not chargeable\n\u201c[w]hen unrelated to an objecting employee\u2019s unit.\u201d 500\nU. S., at 528. But, again, reciprocal litigation funding was\nnot before the Court; hence the plurality could not (and\ndid not) decide whether an understanding as to reciprocity\nproduced the relationship necessary for chargeability.\nRegardless, a plurality does not speak for the Court as a\nwhole.\n   Nor can one simply add together the four Lehnert dis\nsenters and the four Members of the plurality in an effort\nto find a majority of Justices who hold the petitioners\u2019\nview. That is because the Lehnert majority, speaking for\nthe Court, adopted a more liberal standard of charge\nability than the standard embraced by the dissent. And\nthe question here is whether that standard permits charg\ning nonmembers for national litigation expenses. There\nwas no majority agreement in Lehnert about the answer to\nthis last mentioned question. The best we can do for the\npetitioners is to find Lehnert ambiguous on the point at\nissue.\n                             IV\n   Applying Lehnert\u2019s standard to the national litigation\nexpenses here at issue, we find them chargeable. First,\nthe kind of national litigation activity for which the local\ncharges nonmembers concerns only those aspects of collec\ntive bargaining, contract administration, or other matters\n12                   LOCKE v. KARASS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the courts have held chargeable. Ellis, supra, at 446\u2013\n447. The lower courts found (and the petitioners here do\nnot dispute) that the local charges nonmembers only for\nthose national litigation activities that, in respect to sub\nject matter, \u201cwere comparable to those undertaken\u201d by the\nlocal and which the local \u201cdeemed chargeable\u201d in its calcu\nlation of the \u201cservice fee.\u201d 498 F. 3d, at 52, 64\u201365. And no\none here denies that under Lehnert this kind of activity\nbears an appropriate relation to collective bargaining.\nSee, e.g., Lehnert, 500 U. S., at 519; see also id., at 524\n(\u201c[A] local bargaining representative may charge objecting\nemployees for their pro rata share of costs associated with\notherwise chargeable activities of its state and national\naffiliates . . . \u201d).\n   Second, the location of the litigation activity is at the\nnational (or extraunit), not the local, level. But, as we\nhave just said (under Lehnert), activity at the national\nlevel is chargeable as long as the charges in question are\n\u201cfor services that may ultimately inure to the benefit of\nthe members of the local union by virtue of their member\nship in the parent organization.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals treated the litigation charge at\nissue as reciprocal in nature, and concluded the District\nCourt must have done so as well. See 498 F. 3d, at 64\u201365.\nThe local union here says that the payment of its affilia\ntion fee gives locals in general access to the national\u2019s\nfinancial resources\u2014compiled via contributions from\nvarious locals\u2014\u201cwhich would not otherwise be available to\nthe local union when needed to effectively negotiate, ad\nminister or enforce the local\u2019s collective bargaining agree\nments.\u201d Brief for Respondents 18\u201319. The resources in\nquestion include resources related to litigation. No one\nclaims that the national would treat the local union before\nus any differently, in terms of making these resources\navailable, than the national would treat any other local.\nThe petitioners do not suggest the contrary.

Consequently, con\nsistent with our precedent, those expenses are chargeable.\nThe similar determination of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

KARASS\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\nthe benefit of any such expenses would be reciprocal.\n   In its brief as amicus curiae, the United States argues\nthat a national union must bear the burden of proving\nthat any expenditures charged to nonmembers of a local\nare made pursuant to a bona fide pooling arrangement.\nSee Brief for United States 28\u201329. Once nonmembers\nobject to a charge, the Government submits, the union\nmust prove that the challenged expenditure was made\npursuant to an arrangement that is akin to an insurance\npolicy. See id., at 7. This is necessary, the Government\ncontends, to ensure that a charge is in fact \u201creciprocal in\nnature.\u201d\n   Because important First Amendment rights are at\nstake, the Government\u2019s argument regarding the burden\nof establishing true reciprocity has considerable force.\nNonetheless, since petitioners in this case did not raise the\nquestion whether the Maine State Employees Associa\ntion\u2019s pooling arrangement was bona fide, we need not\nreach that question today.\n</pre>",
