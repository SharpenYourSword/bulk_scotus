SARAUSAD \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 07–772.      Argued October 15, 2008—Decided January 21, 2009\nRespondent Sarausad drove the car in a driveby shooting at a high\n  school, which was the culmination of a gang dispute. En route to\n  school, Ronquillo, the front seat passenger, covered his lower face and\n  readied a handgun. Sarausad abruptly slowed down upon reaching\n  the school, Ronquillo fired at a group of students, killing one and\n  wounding another, and Sarausad then sped away. He, Ronquillo,\n  and Reyes, another passenger, were tried on murder and related\n  charges. Sarausad and Reyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued\n  that they were not accomplices to murder because they had not\n  known Ronquillo’s plan and had expected at most another fistfight.\n  In her closing argument, the prosecutor stressed Sarausad’s knowl\n  edge of a shooting, noting how he drove at the scene, that he knew\n  that fighting alone would not regain respect for his gang, and that he\n  was “in for a dime, in for a dollar.” The jury received two instructions\n  that directly quoted Washington’s accomplice-liability law. When it\n  failed to reach a verdict as to Reyes, the judge declared a mistrial as\n  to him. The jury then convicted Ronquillo on all counts and convicted\n  Sarausad of second-degree murder and related crimes. In affirming\n  Sarausad’s conviction, the State Court of Appeals, among other\n  things, referred to an “in for a dime, in for a dollar” accomplice\n  liability theory. The State Supreme Court denied review, but in its\n  subsequent Roberts case, it clarified that “in for a dime, in for a dol\n  lar” was not the best descriptor of accomplice liability because an ac\n  complice must have knowledge of the crime that occurred. The court\n  also explicitly reaffirmed its precedent that the type of jury instruc\n  tions used at Sarausad’s trial comport with Washington law.\n  Sarausad sought state postconviction relief, arguing that the prose\n2                     WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cutor’s improper “in for a dime, in for a dollar” argument may have\n    led the jury to convict him as an accomplice to murder based solely on\n    a finding that he had anticipated that an assault would occur. The\n    state appeals court reexamined the trial record in light of Roberts,\n    but found no error requiring correction. The State Supreme Court\n    denied Sarausad’s petition, holding that the trial court correctly in\n    structed the jury and that no prejudicial error resulted from the\n    prosecutor’s potentially improper hypothetical.         Sarausad then\n    sought review under 28 U. S. C. §2254, which, inter alia, permits a\n    federal court to grant habeas relief on a claim “adjudicated on the\n    merits” in state court only if the decision “was contrary to, or involved\n    an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n    determined by” this Court, §2254(d)(1). The District Court granted\n    the petition, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding it unreasonable\n    for the state court to affirm Sarausad’s conviction because the jury\n    instruction on accomplice liability was ambiguous and there was a\n    reasonable likelihood that the jury misinterpreted the instruction in\n    a way that relieved the State of its burden of proving Sarausad’s\n    knowledge of a shooting beyond a reasonable doubt.\nHeld: Because the state-court decision did not result in an “unreason\n able application of . . . clearly established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1),\n the Ninth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief to Sarausad.\n Pp. 10–17.\n    (a) When a state court’s application of governing federal law is\n challenged, the decision “ ‘must be shown to be not only erroneous,\n but objectively unreasonable.’ ” Middleton v. McNeil, 541 U. S. 433,\n 436 (per curiam). A defendant challenging the constitutionality of a\n jury instruction that quotes a state statute must show both that the\n instruction was ambiguous and that there was “ ‘a reasonable likeli\n hood’ ” that the jury applied the instruction in a way that relieved the\n State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a\n reasonable doubt. Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72. The instruc\n tion “must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole\n and the trial record,” ibid., and the pertinent question is whether the\n “instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting\n conviction violates due process,’ ” ibid. Pp. 10–11.\n    (b) Because the Washington courts’ conclusion that the jury in\n struction was unambiguous was not objectively unreasonable, the\n Ninth Circuit should have ended its §2254(d)(1) inquiry there. The\n instruction parroted the state statute’s language, requiring the jury\n to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice “in the commission of the\n [murder]” if he acted “with knowledge that [his conduct would] pro\n mote or facilitate the commission of the [murder],” Wash. Rev. Code\n §§9A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a). The instruction cannot be assigned any\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  meaning different from the one given to it by the Washington courts.\n  Pp. 11–12.\n     (c) Even if the instruction were ambiguous, the Ninth Circuit still\n  erred in finding it so ambiguous as to cause a federal constitutional\n  violation requiring reversal under AEDPA. The Washington courts\n  reasonably applied this Court’s precedent when they found no “rea\n  sonable likelihood” that the prosecutor’s closing argument caused the\n  jury to apply the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its\n  burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable\n  doubt. The prosecutor consistently argued that Sarausad was guilty\n  as an accomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was facili\n  tating a driveby shooting. She never argued that the admission by\n  Sarausad and Reyes that they anticipated a fight was a concession of\n  accomplice liability for murder. Sarausad’s attorney also homed in\n  on the key question, stressing a lack of evidence showing that\n  Sarausad knew that his assistance would promote or facilitate a\n  premeditated murder. Every state and federal appellate court that\n  reviewed the verdict found the evidence supporting Sarausad’s\n  knowledge of a shooting legally sufficient to convict him under Wash\n  ington law. Given the strength of that evidence, and the jury’s fail\n  ure to convict Reyes—who had also been charged as an accomplice to\n  murder and admitted knowledge of a possible fight—it was not objec\n  tively unreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the\n  jury convicted Sarausad because it believed that he, unlike Reyes,\n  had knowledge of more than just a fistfight. The Ninth Circuit’s con\n  trary reasoning is unconvincing. Pp. 13–17.\n479 F. 3d 671, reversed and remanded.\n\n   THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

CESAR SARAUSAD \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 21, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case arose from a fatal driveby shooting into a\ngroup of students standing in front of a Seattle high\nschool. Brian Ronquillo was ultimately identified as the\ngunman; at the time of the shooting, he was a passenger\nin a car driven by respondent Cesar Sarausad II. A jury\nconvicted Sarausad as an accomplice to second-degree\nmurder, attempted murder, and assault; he was sentenced\nto just over 27 years of imprisonment. The Washington\ncourts affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct\nreview, and his state-court motions for postconviction\nrelief were denied.\n  Respondent, then, filed a federal petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. The District Court granted the writ. On\nappeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed\nwith the District Court that the state-court decision was\nan objectively “unreasonable application of . . . clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The\nCourt of Appeals found it unreasonable for the state court\n2                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto reject Sarausad’s argument that certain jury instruc\ntions used at his trial were ambiguous and were likely\nmisinterpreted by the jury to relieve the State of its bur\nden of proving every element of the crime beyond a rea\nsonable doubt. Sarausad v. Porter, 479 F. 3d 671 (2007).\nWe disagree. Because the Washington courts reasonably\napplied our precedent to the facts of this case, we reverse\nthe judgment below.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n  The driveby shooting was the culmination of a gang\ndispute between the 23d Street Diablos, of which Cesar\nSarausad was a member, and the Bad Side Posse, which\nwas headquartered at Ballard High School in Seattle,\nWashington. A member of the Diablos, Jerome Reyes, had\nbeen chased from Ballard by members of the Bad Side\nPosse, so the Diablos decided to go “to Ballard High School\nto show that the Diablos were not afraid” of the rival gang.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 235a. The Diablos started a fight\nwith the Bad Side Posse, but left quickly after someone\nindicated that police were nearby. They went to a gang\nmember’s house, still angry because the Bad Side Posse\nhad “called [them] weak.” Tr. 2660–2661. Brian Ron\nquillo retrieved a handgun, and the gang decided to return\nto Ballard and “get [their] respect back.” Id., at 2699.\n  Sarausad drove, with Ronquillo in the front passenger\nseat and Reyes and two other Diablos in the back seat. En\nroute, someone in the car mentioned “ ‘capping’ ” the Bad\nSide Posse, and Ronquillo tied a bandana over the lower\npart of his face and readied the handgun.

Sarausad asked the other\ndriver, “ ‘Are you ready?’ ” id., at 844–845, 39 P. 3d, at 319,\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Once\nin front of the school, Sarausad abruptly slowed to about\nfive miles per hour while Ronquillo fired 6 to 10 shots at a\ngroup of students standing in front of it. Id., at 831, 39\nP. 3d, at 312. Sarausad “saw everyone go down,” Tr. 2870,\nand then sped away, 109 Wash. App., at 832, 39 P. 3d, at\n313. The gunfire killed one student; another student was\nwounded when a bullet fragment struck his leg. Id., at\n831–832, 39 P. 3d, at 312–313.\n                             B\n  Sarausad, Ronquillo, and Reyes were tried for the first\ndegree murder of Melissa Fernandes, the attempted first\ndegree murders of Ryan Lam and Tam Nguyen, and the\nsecond-degree assault of Brent Mason. Sarausad and\nReyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued at trial that\nthey could not have been accomplices to murder because\nthey “had no idea whatsoever that Ronquillo had armed\nhimself for the return trip.” Id., at 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313.\nThey claimed that they expected, at most, another fistfight\nwith the Bad Side Posse and were “totally and utterly\ndismayed when Ronquillo started shooting.” Ibid.\n  Sarausad’s counsel, in particular, argued that there was\nno evidence that Sarausad expected anything more than\nthat the two gangs “would exchange insults, and maybe,\nmaybe get into a fight.” Tr. 1151. Sarausad testified that\nhe considered only the “possibility of a fight,” id., at 2799,\nbut never the possibility of a shooting, 109 Wash. App.,\nat 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313. During closing arguments,\nSarausad’s attorney again argued that the evidence\nshowed only that Sarausad was “willing to fight them the\nway they fought them the first time. And that is by push\ning and shoving and more tough talk.” App. 81. That was\nnot sufficient, the attorney argued, to find that “Cesar\n[Sarausad] had knowledge that his assistance would\npromote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder.”\n4                  WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 83. Sarausad’s attorney also explained to the jury\nthat knowledge of just any crime, such as knowledge that\ncriminal assistance would be rendered after the shooting,\nwould be insufficient to hold Sarausad responsible as an\naccomplice to murder because “[a]ccomplice liability re\nquires that one assists with knowledge, that their actions\nwill promote or facilitate the commission of the crime.”\nId., at 100 (emphasis added).\n   In response, the prosecutor focused much of her closing\nargument on the evidence of Sarausad’s knowledge of a\nshooting. He had “slowed down before the shots were\nfired, stayed slowed down until the shots were over and\nimmediately sped up.” Id., at 39. “There was no hesita\ntion, there was no stopping the car. There was no attempt\nfor Mr. Sarausad to swerve his car out of the way so that\ninnocent people wouldn’t get shot.” Id., at 40. She also\nargued that Sarausad knew when he drove back to the\nschool that his gang’s “fists didn’t work, the pushing didn’t\nwork, the flashing of the signs, the violent altercation\ndidn’t work” because the Bad Side Posse still “laughed at\nthem, they called them weak, they called them nothing.”\nId., at 44. So, “[w]hen they rode down to Ballard High\nSchool that last time, . . . [t]hey knew they were there to\ncommit a crime, to disrespect the gang, to fight, to shoot,\nto get that respect back. A fist didn’t work, pushing didn’t\nwork. Shouting insults at them didn’t work. Shooting was\ngoing to work. In for a dime, you’re in for a dollar.” Id., at\n123–124.\n   At the close of trial, the jury received two instructions\nthat directly quoted Washington’s accomplice-liability\nstatute.1 Instruction number 45 provided:\n——————\n  1 Washington’s accomplice-liability statute provides, in pertinent\n\npart:\n  “A person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of\nanother person for which he is legally accountable.

A person is\n     legally accountable for the conduct of another person\n     when he is an accomplice of such other person in the\n     commission of the crime.” Id., at 16 (emphasis added).\nInstruction number 46 provided, in relevant part:\n       “A person is an accomplice in the commission of a\n     crime if, with knowledge that it will promote or facili\n     tate the commission of the crime, he or she either:\n       “(1) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests an\n     other person to commit the crime or\n       “(2) aids or agrees to aid another person in plan\n     ning or committing the crime.” Id., at 17 (emphasis\n     added).\n   During seven days of deliberations, the jury asked five\nquestions, three of which related to the intent requirement\nfor accomplice liability. One questioned the accomplice\nliability standard as it related to the first-degree murder\ninstructions; one questioned the standard as it related to\nthe second-degree murder instructions; and one stated\nthat the jury was “having difficulty agreeing on the legal\ndefinition and concept of ‘accomplice’ ” and whether a\nperson’s “willing participat[ion] in a group activity” makes\n——————\n    .              .                 .                  .        .\n  “He is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the\ncrime.\n  “A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a\ncrime if . . . [w]ith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the\ncommission of the crime, he\n  “(i) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests such other person to\ncommit it; or\n  “(ii) aids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or commit\nting it.” Wash. Rev. Code §§9A.08.020(1)–(3) (2008) (internal number\ning omitted).\n6                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“that person an accomplice to any crime committed by\nanyone in the group.” Id., at 129. In response to each\nquestion, the judge instructed the jury to reread the ac\ncomplice-liability instructions and to consider the instruc\ntions as a whole.\n   The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to Reyes, and\nthe judge declared a mistrial as to him. The jury then\nreturned guilty verdicts on all counts for Ronquillo and\nconvicted Sarausad of the lesser included crimes of second\ndegree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and\nsecond-degree assault.\n                             C\n   On appeal, Sarausad argued that because the State did\nnot prove that he had intent to kill, he could not be con\nvicted as an accomplice to second-degree murder under\nWashington law. The Washington Court of Appeals af\nfirmed his convictions, explaining that under Washington\nlaw, an accomplice must have “general knowledge” that\nthe crime will occur, but need not have the specific intent\nrequired for that crime’s commission. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 259a. The court referred to accomplice liability as “a\ntheory of criminal liability that in Washington has been\nreduced to the maxim, ‘in for a dime, in for a dollar.’ ” Id.,\nat 235a.

Therefore, he argued, the jury may have\nconvicted him as an accomplice to second-degree murder\nbased solely on his admission that he anticipated that an\nassault would occur at Ballard High School.\n  The Washington Court of Appeals reexamined the trial\nrecord in its entirety in light of Roberts, see 109 Wash.\nApp., at 834, 39 P. 3d, at 313–314, but found no error\nrequiring correction. According to the court, the prosecu\ntor’s closing argument in its entirety did not convey “that\nthe jury could find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice to\nmurder if he had the purpose to facilitate an offense of any\nkind whatsoever, even a shoving match or fist fight.” Id.,\nat 840, 39 P. 3d, at 317. The prosecutor’s “ ‘in for a dime,\nin for a dollar’ ” illustration also did not convey that stan\ndard. Id., at 842–843, 39 P. 3d, at 318. The court ex\nplained that in every situation but one, the prosecutor\nclearly did not use that phrase to argue that Sarausad\ncould be convicted of murder if he intended only a fistfight.\nInstead, she used it to convey a “gang mentality” that\nrequires a wrong to the gang to be avenged by any means\nnecessary. Ibid. Thus, according to the prosecutor, when\na fight did not work, Sarausad knew that a shooting was\nrequired to avenge his gang. See ibid.\n  There was one “in for a dime, in for a dollar” hypotheti\ncal in the prosecutor’s closing that did not convey this\ngang-mentality meaning and thus, the court recognized,\n“may or may not be problematic under Roberts” depending\non how it was interpreted. Id., at 843, 39 P. 3d, at 318.3\n——————\n    3 The prosecutor had argued in the hypothetical that an accomplice\nwho knows that he is helping someone assault a victim bears responsi\nbility if the victim is killed.

Sarausad’s\njury was properly instructed and “the prosecutor made it\ncrystal clear to the jury that the State wanted Sarausad\nfound guilty . . . because he knowingly facilitated the\ndrive-by shooting and for no other reason.” Id., at 843–\n844, 39 P. 3d, at 319.\n   Sarausad sought discretionary postconviction review\nfrom the Supreme Court of Washington. In denying his\npetition, the court held that “the trial court correctly\ninstructed the jury” that knowledge of the particular crime\ncommitted was required. App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a. The\ncourt also found that no prejudicial error resulted from the\nprosecutor’s potentially improper hypothetical. Id., at\n192a. “[W]hatever the flaws in the argument, the prosecu\ntor properly focused on Mr. Sarausad’s knowing participa\ntion in the shooting, not in some lesser altercation.” Ibid.\n                              E\n   Sarausad filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nin Federal District Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254.\nThe District Court granted the petition, finding “ample\nevidence that the jury was confused about what elements\nhad to be established in order for [Sarausad] to be found\nguilty of second degree murder and second degree at\ntempted murder.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a. The Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that the\nstate postconviction court unreasonably applied this\nCourt’s decisions in Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.

In making this determination, the\njury instruction “ ‘may not be judged in artificial isolation,’\nbut must be considered in the context of the instructions\nas a whole and the trial record.” Estelle, supra, at 72\n(quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973)).\nBecause it is not enough that there is some “slight possi\nbility” that the jury misapplied the instruction, Weeks v.\nAngelone, 528 U. S. 225, 236 (2000), the pertinent question\n“is ‘whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the\nentire trial that the resulting conviction violates due\nprocess,’ ” Estelle, supra, at 72 (quoting Cupp, supra, at\n147).\n                             A\n   The Washington courts reasonably concluded that the\ntrial court’s instruction to the jury was not ambiguous.\nThe instruction parroted the language of the statute,\nrequiring that an accomplice “in the commission of the\ncrime” take action “with knowledge that it will promote or\nfacilitate the commission of the crime.” App. 16–17 (em\nphasis added); Wash. Rev. Code §§9A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a)\n(2008). It is impossible to assign any meaning to this\ninstruction different from the meaning given to it by the\nWashington courts. By its plain terms, it instructed the\njury to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice “in the com\nmission of the [murder]” only if he acted “with knowledge\nthat [his conduct] will promote or facilitate the commis\nsion of the [murder].” App. 16–17.4 Because the conclu\n——————\n  4 The dissent would reverse the Washington state courts based on the\n\nalleged confusion in Washington courts, and specifically in the Wash\nington Court of Appeals on direct review, about the meaning of the\n12                   WADDINGTON v.

But the confusion in the Court of Appeals over the appli\ncation of the statute involved the related, but legally distinct, question\nwhether an accomplice is required to share the specific intent of the\nprincipal actor under Washington law. On direct appeal, respondent\nargued that he should not have been convicted as an accomplice to\nmurder because he did not have the specific intent to kill. The Wash\nington Court of Appeals rejected that argument because “it was not\nnecessary for the State to prove Sarausad knew Ronquillo had a gun, or\nknew that there was a potential for gunplay that day” under Washing\nton law, App. to Pet. for Cert. 266a, where “accomplice liability predi\ncates criminal liability on general knowledge of a crime, rather than\nspecific knowledge of the elements of the principal’s crime,” id., at 259a.\nBut the Washington Court of Appeals never held that knowledge of a\ncompletely different crime, such as assault, would be sufficient under\nWashington law for accomplice liability for murder. See id., at 258a–\n259a; see also In re Domingo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367–368, 119 P. 3d\n816, 822 (2005) (“[N]either Davis nor any of this court’s decisions\nsubsequent to Davis approves of the proposition that accomplice liabil\nity attaches for any and all crimes committed by the principal so long\nas the putative accomplice knowingly aided in any one of the crimes”).\nIn other words, the Court of Appeals had evaluated whether respon\ndent’s conviction required a specific intent versus a general intent to\nkill, not whether it required knowledge of a murder versus knowledge\nof an assault—the issue under review here. Thus, the confusion in the\nstate courts referenced by the dissent has no bearing on the question\npresented in this appeal, and does not support the dissent’s argument\nthat the jury instruction in question was ambiguous.\n   5 To the extent that the Court of Appeals attempted to rewrite state\n\nlaw by proposing that the instruction should have included “an explicit\nstatement that an accomplice must have knowledge of . . . the actual\ncrime the principal intends to commit,” 479 F. 3d 671, 689–690 (CA9\n2007), it compounded its error. The Washington Supreme Court\nexpressly held that the jury instruction correctly set forth state law,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 191a, and we have repeatedly held that “it is not\nthe province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court deter\nminations on state-law questions.” Estelle v.

S. C. §2254(d). The\nWashington courts reasonably applied this Court’s prece\ndent when they determined that there was no “reasonable\nlikelihood” that the prosecutor’s closing argument caused\nSarausad’s jury to apply the instruction in a way that\nrelieved the State of its burden to prove every element of\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor\nconsistently argued that Sarausad was guilty as an ac\ncomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was\nfacilitating a driveby shooting. Indeed, Sarausad and\nReyes had admitted under oath that they anticipated a\nfight, Tr. 2671, 2794, and yet the prosecutor never argued\nthat their admission was a concession of accomplice liabil\nity for murder. She instead argued that Sarausad knew\nthat a shooting was intended, App. 123, because he drove\nhis car in a way that would help Ronquillo “fire those\nshots,” id., at 39. The closing argument of Sarausad’s\nattorney also homed in on the key legal question: He\nchallenged the jury to look for evidence that Sarausad\n“had knowledge that his assistance would promote or\nfacilitate the crime of premeditated murder” and argued\nthat no such evidence existed. Id., at 83.\n   Put simply, there was no evidence of ultimate juror confu\nsion as to the test for accomplice liability under Washington\nlaw. Rather, the jury simply reached a unanimous decision\nthat the State had proved Sarausad’s guilt beyond a reason\nable doubt. Indeed, every state and federal appellate court\nthat reviewed the verdict found that the evidence supporting\nSarausad’s knowledge of a shooting was legally sufficient to\nconvict him under Washington law. 479 F. 3d, at 677–683;\nSarausad, 109 Wash. App., at 844–845, 39 P. 3d, at 319.\n14               WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGiven the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction,\nalong with the jury’s failure to convict Reyes—who also had\nbeen charged as an accomplice to murder and also had ad\nmitted knowledge of a possible fight—it was not objectively\nunreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the\njury convicted Sarausad only because it believed that he,\nunlike Reyes, had knowledge of more than just a fistfight.\nThe reasoning of the Court of Appeals, which failed to review\nthe state courts’ resolution of this question through the\ndeferential lens of AEDPA, does not convince us otherwise.\n   First, the Court of Appeals found that the evidence of\nSarausad’s knowledge of the shooting was so “thin” that\nthe jury must have incorrectly believed that proof of such\nknowledge was not required. 479 F. 3d, at 692–693. That\nconclusion, however, is foreclosed by the Court of Appeals’\nown determination that the evidence was sufficient for a\nrational jury to reasonably infer that Sarausad knowingly\nfacilitated the driveby shooting. As explained above, the\nCourt of Appeals acknowledged that the evidence showed\nthat Ronquillo, while seated in Sarausad’s front passenger\nseat, tied a bandana over the lower part of his face and\npulled out a gun. Id., at 681. There also was evidence\nthat Sarausad then asked the Diablos in the other car,\n“ ‘Are you ready?’ ” before driving to the school and\n“slow[ing] his car in front of the school in a manner that\nfacilitated a drive-by shooting.” Ibid. Other gang mem\nbers testified to prior knowledge of the gun and to discuss\ning the shooting as an option during the gang meeting\nheld between trips to Ballard High School. Id., at 682.\nThere also was testimony from Sarausad that he sus\npected that members of the Bad Side Posse would be\narmed when they returned to Ballard High School, ibid.,\nmaking it reasonable to conclude that Sarausad would\nexpect his gang to be similarly prepared for the confronta\ntion. There was nothing “thin” about the evidence of\nSarausad’s guilt.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Second, the Court of Appeals faulted the prosecutor for\narguing “clearly and forcefully” for an “in for a dime, in for\na dollar” theory of accomplice liability. Id., at 693. But\nthe Washington Court of Appeals conducted an in-depth\nanalysis of the prosecutor’s argument and reasonably\nfound that it contained, at most, one problematic hypo\nthetical. Sarausad, supra, at 842–843, 39 P. 3d, at 318–\n319. The state court’s conclusion that the one hypothetical\ndid not taint the proper instruction of state law was rea\nsonable under this Court’s precedent, which acknowledges\nthat “arguments of counsel generally carry less weight\nwith a jury than do instructions from the court.” Boyde,\n494 U. S., at 384. On habeas review, the Court of Appeals\nshould not have dissected the closing argument and exag\ngerated the possible effect of one hypothetical in it. There\nwas nothing objectively unreasonable about the Washing\nton courts’ resolution of this question.6\n  Third, and last, the Court of Appeals believed that the\njury’s questions “demonstrated substantial confusion\nabout what the State was required to prove.” 479 F. 3d, at\n693. Sarausad focuses special attention on this factor,\n——————\n   6 The dissent accuses us of downplaying this ambiguous hypothetical,\n\narguing that it is so rife with improper meaning that it “infect[ed] every\nfurther statement bearing on accomplice law the prosecutor made,”\npost, at 7, and ensured that the jury misinterpreted the trial court’s\nproperly-phrased instruction. We disagree. The proper inquiry is\nwhether the state court was objectively unreasonable in concluding that\nthe instruction (which precisely tracked the language of the accomplice\nliability statute) was not warped by this one-paragraph hypothetical in\nan argument and rebuttal spanning 31 pages of the joint appendix.\nThe state court’s conclusion was not unreasonable. The hypothetical\nwas presented during closing arguments, which juries generally “vie[w]\nas the statements of advocates” rather than “as definitive and binding\nstatements of the law,” Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 384 (1990),\nand which, as a whole, made clear that the State sought a guilty verdict\nbased solely on Sarausad’s “knowledge that his assistance would\npromote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder,” App. 83; see\nalso id., at 123–124.\n16                  WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\narguing that it was the “failure to remedy” this confusion\nthat sets this case apart from previous decisions and\nestablishes that the jury likely “did not understand ac\ncomplice liability” when it returned its verdict. Brief for\nRespondent 29, 31. But this Court has determined that\nthe Constitution generally requires nothing more from a\ntrial judge than the type of answers given to the jury here.\nWeeks, 528 U. S., at 234. Where a judge “respond[s] to the\njury’s question by directing its attention to the precise\nparagraph of the constitutionally adequate instruction\nthat answers its inquiry,” and the jury asks no followup\nquestion, this Court has presumed that the jury fully\nunderstood the judge’s answer and appropriately applied\nthe jury instructions. Ibid.\n   Under this established standard, it was not objectively\nunreasonable for the state court to conclude that\nSarausad’s jury received the answers it needed to resolve\nits confusion.7 Its questions were spaced throughout seven\n\n——————\n   7 The dissent argues that we “sideste[p] the thrust of this record” by\n\nfinding that the trial judge’s answers to the jury’s questions were\nsatisfactory. Post, at 9–10. But our decision cannot turn on a de novo\nreview of the record or a finding that the answers were “the best way to\nanswer jurors’ questions,” id., at 10. On federal habeas review, this\nCourt’s inquiry is limited to whether the state court violated clearly\nestablished federal law when it held that the jury applied the correct\nstandard, in light of the answers given to its questions. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). On that issue, the state court was not objectively unrea\nsonable; the jury’s questions were answered in a manner previously\napproved by this Court, and they consistently referred the jury to the\ncorrect standard for accomplice liability in Washington. The dissent\nalso ignores the important fact that the jury convicted Ronquillo of\nfirst-degree murder, convicted respondent of second-degree murder,\nand failed to reach an agreement on Reyes’ guilt, causing a mistrial on\nthe first-degree murder charge pending against him. The jury’s as\nsignment of culpability to two of the codefendants, versus its deadlock\nover a third who, like respondent, conceded knowledge of an assault,\ndemonstrates that the jury understood the legal significance of each\ndefendant’s relative knowledge and intent with respect to the murder.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The judge pinpointed his answers to the\nparticular instructions responsive to the questions and\nthose instructions reflected state law. Under these cir\ncumstances, the state court did not act in an objectively\nunreasonable manner in finding that the jury knew the\nproper legal standard for conviction.\n                            III\n  Because the state-court decision did not result in an\n“unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Fed\neral law,” 28 U.

The underlying question is whether the\njury may have thought it could find Sarausad guilty as an\naccomplice to murder on the theory that he assisted in\nwhat he expected would be a fist fight, or whether the jury\nknew that to convict him Washington law required it to\nconclude Sarausad aided in what he understood was in\ntended to be a killing.\n   So far as the instructions addressed these alternatives,\nthe judge charged the jurors in these words:\n    “A person is an accomplice in the commission of a\n    crime if, with knowledge that it will promote or facili\n    tate the commission of the crime, he or she either:\n      “(1) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests an\n    other person to commit the crime or\n      “(2) aids or agrees to aid another person in planning\n    or committing the crime.” App. 17.\n  The majority answers the underlying question by rely\n2                WADDINGTON v.

The\nkicker of course is that the general rule is only good if the\nincorporated statute is clear enough to require the jury to\nfind facts amounting to a violation of the law as correctly\nunderstood.\n   Does the rule apply here? The majority says it does. It\nsays the instruction quoted is unambiguous because it\nparrots the language of the Washington statute on accom\nplice liability, ante, at 11, and that “[i]t is impossible to\nassign any meaning to this instruction” and, by extension,\nthe statute, “different from the meaning given to it by the\nWashington courts,” ibid.\n   That is not, however, what the record shows. Rather\nthan a single understanding, the Washington courts have\nproduced a record of discordant positions on the meaning\nof the statute, and the Washington Court of Appeals can\nitself attest to a degree of difficulty in understanding the\nstatutory requirement sufficient to show the statute to be\nambiguous and the statute-based instruction constitution\nally inadequate: that court read the statute to mean just\nthe opposite of what the majority now claims it unambigu\nously requires.\n   On Sarausad’s direct appeal in 1998, the State Court of\nAppeals set out the principles on which it understood\naccomplice liability in Washington to be premised.

In Roberts, the State Supreme Court\nrevisited Davis, which it explained as standing for the\nprinciple “that an accomplice need not have specific\nknowledge of every element of the crime committed by the\n4                WADDINGTON v.

Given\nthat error on the majority’s part, it has not justified its\nreversal of the Ninth Circuit by showing that the instruc\ntion was clear.*\n   There remains the question whether the majority’s\nsecond conclusion is also unjustifiable: despite inadequate\ninstruction, did the jurors nevertheless apply the correct\nview of state law, which only recently, and after the trial,\nattained its current clarity? The state postconviction court\nfound no reasonable likelihood that the jurors failed to\napply a correct understanding of accomplice liability,\nSarausad v. Washington, supra, at 843–844, 39 P. 3d, at\n318–319, and Sarausad’s burden here (on federal habeas)\n——————\n   * As the majority notes, ante, at 11, n. 4, in the Washington Court of\nAppeals on direct review, Sarausad’s counsel claimed that state law\nrequired that an accomplice to murder have a specific intent to kill (or\naid in killing). The Court of Appeals rejected this position. Contrary to\nthe majority view, ante, at 12, n. 4, in gauging the adequacy of an\ninstruction incorporating statutory terms, the fact that defense counsel\nmay have asked for too much does nothing to lessen the pertinence of\nopaque state law or its uncertainty in the minds of the state judges.\nThe Court of Appeals in its very response to counsel’s argument demon\nstrated its misunderstanding of the scope of Washington accomplice\nliability law: “accomplice liability predicates criminal liability on\ngeneral knowledge of a crime.” Washington v. Ronquillo, No. 35840–5–\nI etc. (Mar. 2, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 233a, 259a (emphasis added).\nFor that matter, the Court of Appeals subsequently disavowed the very\nstatement used by the majority to support its contention that the court\nwas focused solely on the issue of specific intent. The court, in the\npostconviction proceedings, concluded that it was in fact necessary for\nthe State to prove Sarausad knew Ronquillo had a gun, or knew there\nwas potential for gunplay that day. Sarausad v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2581346\"><a href=\"/opinion/2581346/sarausad-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

This knowledge would\nhave been necessary regardless of whether the law required Sarausad\nto have specific or general intent to kill, unless, of course, accomplice\nliability was predicated on an “in for a dime, in for a dollar” theory of\nliability and knowledge of a fistfight could suffice.\n6               WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nis to demonstrate that the state court was objectively\nunreasonable in drawing this conclusion, 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). The District Court and the Ninth Circuit\nfound he had done just that, whereas the majority today\ninsists those courts were wrong.\n  The majority’s position is simply unrealistic. Even a\njuror with a preternatural grasp of the statutory subtlety\nwould have lost his grip after listening to the prosecutor’s\nclosing argument, which first addressed the state law of\naccomplice liability with a statement that was flatout\nerror, followed that with a confusing argument that could\nhave reflected either the correct or the erroneous view,\nand concluded with an argument that could have fit either\ntheory but ended with a phrase defined to express the\nerroneous one.\n  In her first pass at the subject, the prosecutor said\nunequivocally that assaultive, not murderous, intent on\nSarausad’s part would suffice for the intent required of an\naccomplice to murder.\n    “Let me give you a good example of accomplice liabil\n    ity. A friend comes up to you and says, ‘Hold this per\n    son’s arms while I hit him.’ You say, ‘Okay, I don’t\n    like that person, anyway.’ You hold the arms. The\n    person not only gets assaulted, he gets killed. You are\n    an accomplice and you can’t come back and say, ‘Well,\n    I only intended this much damage to happen.’ Your\n    presence, your readiness to assist caused the crime to\n    occur and you are an accomplice. The law in the State\n    of Washington says, if you’re in for a dime, you’re in\n    for a dollar. If you’re there or even if you’re not there\n    and you’re helping in some fashion to bring about this\n    crime, you are just as guilty.” App. 38.\nThus, in what the majority would launder into “one prob\nlematic hypothetical,” ante, at 15, the prosecutor intro\nduced the “in for a dime, in for a dollar” locution, which\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nshe defined to mean that readiness to aid in the commis\nsion of any crime thought to be intended by the principal\nis enough intent for accomplice liability for whatever\ncrime the principal actually commits. This lead-off mis\nstatement of the law, never corrected by the trial judge,\ninfects every further statement bearing on accomplice law\nthe prosecutor made, for into each effort she consistently\nintroduced the viral catchphrase “in for a dime, in for a\ndollar.”\n  In a second reference to accomplice law, the prosecutor\ndiscussed gang mentality and used the phrase, without\nmodifying her earlier explanation of its legal meaning,\nthen followed up with a reference to the evidence that\ncould have fit either the erroneous theory or the law as\ncorrected by Roberts:\n      “Mr. Sarausad [was] present and . . . certainly ready\n    to assist. And I remind you, too, what you heard not\n    only from . . . the gang expert in this case, but from\n    [gang] member after [gang] member who told you that\n    an affront to one is an affront to all, ‘When you disre\n    spect me you disrespect my gang.’ . . .\n      “They were all there that day . . . ready to back each\n    other up in whatever happened. In for a dime, they\n    were in for a dollar and they were sticking together.\n      “ . . . You know, the best indication of what was go\n    ing on just before the shooting is gleaned by what\n    happened immediately after the fact. . . . Nothing\n    [was] said to the [gunman], because there was nothing\n    to say. Nobody asked him why he did it. They all\n    knew. They all knew what they were there for. An af\n    front to one is an affront to all.” App. 40–41.\n   The confusion of the correct and erroneous theories of\nliability showed up again in the prosecutor’s final rebuttal:\n      “Mr. Sarausad’s lawyer says that an accomplice has\n    to have the same mental state as the person doing the\n8                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n    shooting. . . . Not true, not true. And that’s not what\n    the instruction says.\n       “And I’ve told you the old adage, you’re in for a\n    dime, you’re in for a dollar. If their logic was correct,\n    they’re not ever an accomplice to anything. The get\n    away driver for a bank robbery would say, ‘I just told\n    him to rob them, I didn’t tell him to shoot him, I didn’t\n    do anything.’ The example I gave you earlier, ‘I just\n    told my friend to hold the arms down of this person\n    while he hit him, I didn’t tell him to kill him, I’m not\n    guilty of anything.’ If you’re in for a dime, you’re in\n    for a dollar.\n       “When they rode down to Ballard High School that\n    last time, I say they knew what they were up to. They\n    knew they were there to commit a crime, to disrespect\n    the gang, to fight, to shoot, to get that respect back. A\n    fist didn’t work, pushing didn’t work. Shouting in\n    sults at them didn’t work. Shooting was going to\n    work. In for a dime, you’re in for a dollar.” Id., at\n    123–124.\nIn the prosecutor’s jumble of rules, one proposition is both\nclear and clearly erroneous: the statement of law, “in for a\ndime, in for a dollar.” It unmistakably contradicts the\nconstruction for which Sarausad’s counsel correctly ar\ngued, which would have required the jury to find that\nSarausad understood that the object was killing in order\nto find him guilty as an accomplice to murder. Id., at 83–\n84.\n    The point here is not to excoriate the prosecutor, who\ntried this case in the period between Roberts and Davis\nand could fairly assume that her expansive (“in for a dime\n. . .”) view of accomplice liability was good law in her State.\nThe point is just the obvious one that cannot be evaded\nwithout playing make-believe with the record: an uncer\ntain instruction by the trial judge was combined with\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nconfounding prosecutorial argument incorporating what\nthe state courts now acknowledge was a clearly-erroneous\nstatement of law, in contrast to the view of the law argued\nby defense counsel. In these circumstances jury confu-\nsion is all but inevitable and jury error the reasonable\nlikelihood.\n   If there were any doubt about that, one could simply\nlook at the record of the jury’s deliberations, in the course\nof which the jurors repeatedly asked the court to clarify\nthe law on accomplice liability. They began deliberating\non Friday, October 21, 1994, and the following Tuesday,\nthey asked (as to the instructions laying out the crime of\nfirst-degree murder and the required premeditation),\n“does the ‘intent’ apply to (the defendant only) or to (the\ndefendant or his accomplice)?” App. 126. The judge re\nplied, “Refer to instructions 46 and 47 and consider your\ninstructions as a whole.” Ibid. Three days later, October\n28, this time in reference to the second-degree murder\ninstructions, the jury enquired a second time about ac\ncomplice liability, asking whether “intentional appl[ies] to\nonly the defendant or only his accomplice?” Id., at 128.\nThe judge’s response was nearly identical to his first one:\n“Refer to instructions 45 & 46 and consider the instruc\ntions as a whole.” Ibid. The following Monday, the jury\nreturned to deliberations and requested help yet again,\nspelling out its confusion: “We are having difficulty agree\ning on the legal definition and concept of ‘accomplice.’ . . .\n[W]hen a person willing[ly] participates in a group activ\nity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed\nby anyone in the group?” Id., at 129. Once again, the\njudge sent the jurors back to the written charge: “Refer to\ninstructions . . . 45, 46, 47, and 48 and consider your in\nstructions as a whole.” Ibid.\n   The majority sidesteps the thrust of this record by sug\ngesting that the jurors failed to let the court know of any\nconfusion: it says the jurors’ questions “involved different\n10              WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncriminal charges, and implicated the interrelation of\nseveral different jury instructions.” Ante, at 17. But this\nsimply ignores the disclosure obviously common to all\nthose questions: the jurors did not understand the state of\nmind the prosecution had to prove for accomplice liability.\nTheir final question makes this unmistakable.\n  The majority says, in any case, that the judge’s repeated\nreferences back to the written instructions were enough\nand that “it was not objectively unreasonable for the state\ncourt to conclude that [the] jury received the answers it\nneeded to resolve its confusion.” Ante, at 16. But after the\njurors asked three times? In many trials, reference back\nto written instructions would be the best way to answer\njurors’ questions, which may reflect uncertain memory,\nnot deficient instruction. But not in this case: the accom\nplice liability instruction was defective owing to the ambi\nguity of the statutory language it incorporated, and its\ndeficiency was underscored by the prosecutor’s erroneous\nargument. Telling the jurors to read an inadequate in\nstruction three more times did nothing to improve upon it\nor enlighten the readers. The District Court and the\nNinth Circuit drew the only conclusion reasonably possible\non this record. I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 145920, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/01/21/Waddington_v._Sarausad.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2008                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

SARAUSAD \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 07–772.      Argued October 15, 2008—Decided January 21, 2009\nRespondent Sarausad drove the car in a driveby shooting at a high\n  school, which was the culmination of a gang dispute. En route to\n  school, Ronquillo, the front seat passenger, covered his lower face and\n  readied a handgun. Sarausad abruptly slowed down upon reaching\n  the school, Ronquillo fired at a group of students, killing one and\n  wounding another, and Sarausad then sped away. He, Ronquillo,\n  and Reyes, another passenger, were tried on murder and related\n  charges. Sarausad and Reyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued\n  that they were not accomplices to murder because they had not\n  known Ronquillo’s plan and had expected at most another fistfight.\n  In her closing argument, the prosecutor stressed Sarausad’s knowl\n  edge of a shooting, noting how he drove at the scene, that he knew\n  that fighting alone would not regain respect for his gang, and that he\n  was “in for a dime, in for a dollar.” The jury received two instructions\n  that directly quoted Washington’s accomplice-liability law. When it\n  failed to reach a verdict as to Reyes, the judge declared a mistrial as\n  to him. The jury then convicted Ronquillo on all counts and convicted\n  Sarausad of second-degree murder and related crimes. In affirming\n  Sarausad’s conviction, the State Court of Appeals, among other\n  things, referred to an “in for a dime, in for a dollar” accomplice\n  liability theory. The State Supreme Court denied review, but in its\n  subsequent Roberts case, it clarified that “in for a dime, in for a dol\n  lar” was not the best descriptor of accomplice liability because an ac\n  complice must have knowledge of the crime that occurred. The court\n  also explicitly reaffirmed its precedent that the type of jury instruc\n  tions used at Sarausad’s trial comport with Washington law.\n  Sarausad sought state postconviction relief, arguing that the prose\n2                     WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cutor’s improper “in for a dime, in for a dollar” argument may have\n    led the jury to convict him as an accomplice to murder based solely on\n    a finding that he had anticipated that an assault would occur. The\n    state appeals court reexamined the trial record in light of Roberts,\n    but found no error requiring correction. The State Supreme Court\n    denied Sarausad’s petition, holding that the trial court correctly in\n    structed the jury and that no prejudicial error resulted from the\n    prosecutor’s potentially improper hypothetical.         Sarausad then\n    sought review under 28 U. S. C. §2254, which, inter alia, permits a\n    federal court to grant habeas relief on a claim “adjudicated on the\n    merits” in state court only if the decision “was contrary to, or involved\n    an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n    determined by” this Court, §2254(d)(1). The District Court granted\n    the petition, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding it unreasonable\n    for the state court to affirm Sarausad’s conviction because the jury\n    instruction on accomplice liability was ambiguous and there was a\n    reasonable likelihood that the jury misinterpreted the instruction in\n    a way that relieved the State of its burden of proving Sarausad’s\n    knowledge of a shooting beyond a reasonable doubt.\nHeld: Because the state-court decision did not result in an “unreason\n able application of . . . clearly established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1),\n the Ninth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief to Sarausad.\n Pp. 10–17.\n    (a) When a state court’s application of governing federal law is\n challenged, the decision “ ‘must be shown to be not only erroneous,\n but objectively unreasonable.’ ” Middleton v. McNeil, 541 U. S. 433,\n 436 (per curiam). A defendant challenging the constitutionality of a\n jury instruction that quotes a state statute must show both that the\n instruction was ambiguous and that there was “ ‘a reasonable likeli\n hood’ ” that the jury applied the instruction in a way that relieved the\n State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a\n reasonable doubt. Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72. The instruc\n tion “must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole\n and the trial record,” ibid., and the pertinent question is whether the\n “instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting\n conviction violates due process,’ ” ibid. Pp. 10–11.\n    (b) Because the Washington courts’ conclusion that the jury in\n struction was unambiguous was not objectively unreasonable, the\n Ninth Circuit should have ended its §2254(d)(1) inquiry there. The\n instruction parroted the state statute’s language, requiring the jury\n to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice “in the commission of the\n [murder]” if he acted “with knowledge that [his conduct would] pro\n mote or facilitate the commission of the [murder],” Wash. Rev. Code\n §§9A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a). The instruction cannot be assigned any\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

The Washington courts\n  reasonably applied this Court’s precedent when they found no “rea\n  sonable likelihood” that the prosecutor’s closing argument caused the\n  jury to apply the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its\n  burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable\n  doubt. The prosecutor consistently argued that Sarausad was guilty\n  as an accomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was facili\n  tating a driveby shooting. She never argued that the admission by\n  Sarausad and Reyes that they anticipated a fight was a concession of\n  accomplice liability for murder. Sarausad’s attorney also homed in\n  on the key question, stressing a lack of evidence showing that\n  Sarausad knew that his assistance would promote or facilitate a\n  premeditated murder. Every state and federal appellate court that\n  reviewed the verdict found the evidence supporting Sarausad’s\n  knowledge of a shooting legally sufficient to convict him under Wash\n  ington law. Given the strength of that evidence, and the jury’s fail\n  ure to convict Reyes—who had also been charged as an accomplice to\n  murder and admitted knowledge of a possible fight—it was not objec\n  tively unreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the\n  jury convicted Sarausad because it believed that he, unlike Reyes,\n  had knowledge of more than just a fistfight. The Ninth Circuit’s con\n  trary reasoning is unconvincing. Pp. 13–17.\n479 F. 3d 671, reversed and remanded.\n\n   THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

CESAR SARAUSAD \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 21, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case arose from a fatal driveby shooting into a\ngroup of students standing in front of a Seattle high\nschool. Brian Ronquillo was ultimately identified as the\ngunman; at the time of the shooting, he was a passenger\nin a car driven by respondent Cesar Sarausad II. A jury\nconvicted Sarausad as an accomplice to second-degree\nmurder, attempted murder, and assault; he was sentenced\nto just over 27 years of imprisonment. The Washington\ncourts affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct\nreview, and his state-court motions for postconviction\nrelief were denied.\n  Respondent, then, filed a federal petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. The District Court granted the writ. On\nappeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed\nwith the District Court that the state-court decision was\nan objectively “unreasonable application of . . . clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The\nCourt of Appeals found it unreasonable for the state court\n2                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto reject Sarausad’s argument that certain jury instruc\ntions used at his trial were ambiguous and were likely\nmisinterpreted by the jury to relieve the State of its bur\nden of proving every element of the crime beyond a rea\nsonable doubt. Sarausad v. Porter, 479 F. 3d 671 (2007).\nWe disagree. Because the Washington courts reasonably\napplied our precedent to the facts of this case, we reverse\nthe judgment below.\n                                I\n\n                                A\n\n  The driveby shooting was the culmination of a gang\ndispute between the 23d Street Diablos, of which Cesar\nSarausad was a member, and the Bad Side Posse, which\nwas headquartered at Ballard High School in Seattle,\nWashington. A member of the Diablos, Jerome Reyes, had\nbeen chased from Ballard by members of the Bad Side\nPosse, so the Diablos decided to go “to Ballard High School\nto show that the Diablos were not afraid” of the rival gang.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 235a. The Diablos started a fight\nwith the Bad Side Posse, but left quickly after someone\nindicated that police were nearby. They went to a gang\nmember’s house, still angry because the Bad Side Posse\nhad “called [them] weak.” Tr. 2660–2661. Brian Ron\nquillo retrieved a handgun, and the gang decided to return\nto Ballard and “get [their] respect back.” Id., at 2699.\n  Sarausad drove, with Ronquillo in the front passenger\nseat and Reyes and two other Diablos in the back seat. En\nroute, someone in the car mentioned “ ‘capping’ ” the Bad\nSide Posse, and Ronquillo tied a bandana over the lower\npart of his face and readied the handgun. Sarausad v.\nState, 109 Wash. App. 824, 844, 39 P. 3d 308, 319 (2001).\nShortly before reaching the high school, a second car of\nDiablos pulled up next to Sarausad’s car and the drivers of\nthe two cars talked briefly. Sarausad asked the other\ndriver, “ ‘Are you ready?’ ” id., at 844–845, 39 P. 3d, at 319,\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand then sped the rest of the way to the high school. Once\nin front of the school, Sarausad abruptly slowed to about\nfive miles per hour while Ronquillo fired 6 to 10 shots at a\ngroup of students standing in front of it. Id., at 831, 39\nP. 3d, at 312. Sarausad “saw everyone go down,” Tr. 2870,\nand then sped away, 109 Wash. App., at 832, 39 P. 3d, at\n313. The gunfire killed one student; another student was\nwounded when a bullet fragment struck his leg. Id., at\n831–832, 39 P. 3d, at 312–313.\n                             B\n  Sarausad, Ronquillo, and Reyes were tried for the first\ndegree murder of Melissa Fernandes, the attempted first\ndegree murders of Ryan Lam and Tam Nguyen, and the\nsecond-degree assault of Brent Mason. Sarausad and\nReyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued at trial that\nthey could not have been accomplices to murder because\nthey “had no idea whatsoever that Ronquillo had armed\nhimself for the return trip.” Id., at 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313.\nThey claimed that they expected, at most, another fistfight\nwith the Bad Side Posse and were “totally and utterly\ndismayed when Ronquillo started shooting.” Ibid.\n  Sarausad’s counsel, in particular, argued that there was\nno evidence that Sarausad expected anything more than\nthat the two gangs “would exchange insults, and maybe,\nmaybe get into a fight.” Tr. 1151. Sarausad testified that\nhe considered only the “possibility of a fight,” id., at 2799,\nbut never the possibility of a shooting, 109 Wash. App.,\nat 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313. During closing arguments,\nSarausad’s attorney again argued that the evidence\nshowed only that Sarausad was “willing to fight them the\nway they fought them the first time. And that is by push\ning and shoving and more tough talk.” App. 81. That was\nnot sufficient, the attorney argued, to find that “Cesar\n[Sarausad] had knowledge that his assistance would\npromote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder.”\n4                  WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 83. Sarausad’s attorney also explained to the jury\nthat knowledge of just any crime, such as knowledge that\ncriminal assistance would be rendered after the shooting,\nwould be insufficient to hold Sarausad responsible as an\naccomplice to murder because “[a]ccomplice liability re\nquires that one assists with knowledge, that their actions\nwill promote or facilitate the commission of the crime.”\nId., at 100 (emphasis added).\n   In response, the prosecutor focused much of her closing\nargument on the evidence of Sarausad’s knowledge of a\nshooting. He had “slowed down before the shots were\nfired, stayed slowed down until the shots were over and\nimmediately sped up.” Id., at 39. “There was no hesita\ntion, there was no stopping the car. There was no attempt\nfor Mr. Sarausad to swerve his car out of the way so that\ninnocent people wouldn’t get shot.” Id., at 40. She also\nargued that Sarausad knew when he drove back to the\nschool that his gang’s “fists didn’t work, the pushing didn’t\nwork, the flashing of the signs, the violent altercation\ndidn’t work” because the Bad Side Posse still “laughed at\nthem, they called them weak, they called them nothing.”\nId., at 44. So, “[w]hen they rode down to Ballard High\nSchool that last time, . . . [t]hey knew they were there to\ncommit a crime, to disrespect the gang, to fight, to shoot,\nto get that respect back. A fist didn’t work, pushing didn’t\nwork. Shouting insults at them didn’t work. Shooting was\ngoing to work. In for a dime, you’re in for a dollar.” Id., at\n123–124.\n   At the close of trial, the jury received two instructions\nthat directly quoted Washington’s accomplice-liability\nstatute.1 Instruction number 45 provided:\n——————\n  1 Washington’s accomplice-liability statute provides, in pertinent\n\npart:\n  “A person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of\nanother person for which he is legally accountable. A person is legally\naccountable for the conduct of another person when:\n                       Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n       “You are instructed that a person is guilty of a\n     crime if it is committed by the conduct of another per\n     son for which he is legally accountable. A person is\n     legally accountable for the conduct of another person\n     when he is an accomplice of such other person in the\n     commission of the crime.” Id., at 16 (emphasis added).\nInstruction number 46 provided, in relevant part:\n       “A person is an accomplice in the commission of a\n     crime if, with knowledge that it will promote or facili\n     tate the commission of the crime, he or she either:\n       “(1) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests an\n     other person to commit the crime or\n       “(2) aids or agrees to aid another person in plan\n     ning or committing the crime.” Id., at 17 (emphasis\n     added).\n   During seven days of deliberations, the jury asked five\nquestions, three of which related to the intent requirement\nfor accomplice liability. One questioned the accomplice\nliability standard as it related to the first-degree murder\ninstructions; one questioned the standard as it related to\nthe second-degree murder instructions; and one stated\nthat the jury was “having difficulty agreeing on the legal\ndefinition and concept of ‘accomplice’ ” and whether a\nperson’s “willing participat[ion] in a group activity” makes\n——————\n    .              .                 .                  .        .\n  “He is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the\ncrime.\n  “A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a\ncrime if . . . [w]ith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the\ncommission of the crime, he\n  “(i) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests such other person to\ncommit it; or\n  “(ii) aids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or commit\nting it.” Wash. Rev. Code §§9A.08.020(1)–(3) (2008) (internal number\ning omitted).\n6                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“that person an accomplice to any crime committed by\nanyone in the group.” Id., at 129. In response to each\nquestion, the judge instructed the jury to reread the ac\ncomplice-liability instructions and to consider the instruc\ntions as a whole.\n   The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to Reyes, and\nthe judge declared a mistrial as to him. The jury then\nreturned guilty verdicts on all counts for Ronquillo and\nconvicted Sarausad of the lesser included crimes of second\ndegree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and\nsecond-degree assault.\n                             C\n   On appeal, Sarausad argued that because the State did\nnot prove that he had intent to kill, he could not be con\nvicted as an accomplice to second-degree murder under\nWashington law. The Washington Court of Appeals af\nfirmed his convictions, explaining that under Washington\nlaw, an accomplice must have “general knowledge” that\nthe crime will occur, but need not have the specific intent\nrequired for that crime’s commission. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 259a. The court referred to accomplice liability as “a\ntheory of criminal liability that in Washington has been\nreduced to the maxim, ‘in for a dime, in for a dollar.’ ” Id.,\nat 235a. The Washington Supreme Court denied discre\ntionary review. State v. Ronquillo, 136 Wash. 2d 1018,\n966 P. 2d 1277 (1998).\n   Shortly thereafter, the Washington Supreme Court\nclarified in an unrelated criminal case that “in for a dime,\nin for a dollar” is not the best descriptor of accomplice\nliability under Washington law because an accomplice\nmust have knowledge of “the crime” that occurs. State v.\nRoberts, 142 Wash. 2d 471, 509–510, 14 P. 3d 713, 734–\n735 (2000). Therefore, an accomplice who knows of one\ncrime—the dime—is not guilty of a greater crime—the\ndollar—if he has no knowledge of that greater crime. It\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwas error, then, to instruct a jury that an accomplice’s\nknowledge of “ ‘a crime’ ” was sufficient to establish accom\nplice liability for “ ‘the crime.’ ” Ibid.2 The Washington\nSupreme Court limited this decision to instructions con\ntaining the phrase “a crime” and explicitly reaffirmed its\nprecedent establishing that jury instructions linking an\naccomplice’s knowledge to “the crime,” such as the instruc\ntion used at Sarausad’s trial, comport with Washington\nlaw. Id., at 511–512, 14 P. 3d, at 736 (discussing State v.\nDavis, 101 Wash. 2d 654, 656, 682 P. 2d 883, 884 (1984)).\nAn instruction that references “the crime” “copie[s] exactly\nthe language from the accomplice liability statute” and\nproperly hinges criminal punishment on knowledge of “the\ncrime” for which the defendant was charged as an accom\nplice. 142 Wash. 2d, at 512, 14 P. 3d, at 736.\n                              D\n  Sarausad next sought postconviction relief from the\nWashington courts. He argued that although the accom\nplice-liability instruction used at his trial complied with\nRoberts, “an additional clarifying instruction should have\nbeen given” because the prosecutor may have confused the\njury by improperly arguing that he had been “ ‘in for a\ndime, in for a dollar.’ ” Sarausad, 109 Wash. App., at 829,\n\n——————\n  2 The instruction found faulty in Roberts provided in full:\n  “You are instructed that a person is guilty of a crime if it is commit\nted by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable.\nA person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when\nhe is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of a crime.\n  “A person is an accomplice in the commission of a crime, whether\npresent at the time of its commission or not, if, with knowledge that it\nwill promote or facilitate its commission, he either:\n  “(a) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests another person to\ncommit the crime; or\n  “(b) aids or agrees to aid another person in planning or committing\nthe crime.” 142 Wash. 2d, at 488–489, 14 P. 3d, at 724 (emphasis\nadded).\n8                  WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n39 P. 3d, at 311. Therefore, he argued, the jury may have\nconvicted him as an accomplice to second-degree murder\nbased solely on his admission that he anticipated that an\nassault would occur at Ballard High School.\n  The Washington Court of Appeals reexamined the trial\nrecord in its entirety in light of Roberts, see 109 Wash.\nApp., at 834, 39 P. 3d, at 313–314, but found no error\nrequiring correction. According to the court, the prosecu\ntor’s closing argument in its entirety did not convey “that\nthe jury could find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice to\nmurder if he had the purpose to facilitate an offense of any\nkind whatsoever, even a shoving match or fist fight.” Id.,\nat 840, 39 P. 3d, at 317. The prosecutor’s “ ‘in for a dime,\nin for a dollar’ ” illustration also did not convey that stan\ndard. Id., at 842–843, 39 P. 3d, at 318. The court ex\nplained that in every situation but one, the prosecutor\nclearly did not use that phrase to argue that Sarausad\ncould be convicted of murder if he intended only a fistfight.\nInstead, she used it to convey a “gang mentality” that\nrequires a wrong to the gang to be avenged by any means\nnecessary. Ibid. Thus, according to the prosecutor, when\na fight did not work, Sarausad knew that a shooting was\nrequired to avenge his gang. See ibid.\n  There was one “in for a dime, in for a dollar” hypotheti\ncal in the prosecutor’s closing that did not convey this\ngang-mentality meaning and thus, the court recognized,\n“may or may not be problematic under Roberts” depending\non how it was interpreted. Id., at 843, 39 P. 3d, at 318.3\n——————\n    3 The prosecutor had argued in the hypothetical that an accomplice\nwho knows that he is helping someone assault a victim bears responsi\nbility if the victim is killed. The hypothetical stated in full:\n  “Let me give you a good example of accomplice liability. A friend\ncomes up to you and says, ‘Hold this person’s arms while I hit him.’\nYou say, ‘Okay, I don’t know that person, anyway.’ You hold the arms.\nThe person not only gets assaulted, he gets killed. You are an accom\nplice and you can’t come back and say, ‘Well, I only intended this much\n                      Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe court concluded that it did not need to decide whether\nthe hypothetical was improper under state law because,\neven if it was, it did not prejudice Sarausad. Sarausad’s\njury was properly instructed and “the prosecutor made it\ncrystal clear to the jury that the State wanted Sarausad\nfound guilty . . . because he knowingly facilitated the\ndrive-by shooting and for no other reason.” Id., at 843–\n844, 39 P. 3d, at 319.\n   Sarausad sought discretionary postconviction review\nfrom the Supreme Court of Washington. In denying his\npetition, the court held that “the trial court correctly\ninstructed the jury” that knowledge of the particular crime\ncommitted was required. App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a. The\ncourt also found that no prejudicial error resulted from the\nprosecutor’s potentially improper hypothetical. Id., at\n192a. “[W]hatever the flaws in the argument, the prosecu\ntor properly focused on Mr. Sarausad’s knowing participa\ntion in the shooting, not in some lesser altercation.” Ibid.\n                              E\n   Sarausad filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nin Federal District Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §2254.\nThe District Court granted the petition, finding “ample\nevidence that the jury was confused about what elements\nhad to be established in order for [Sarausad] to be found\nguilty of second degree murder and second degree at\ntempted murder.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a. The Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that the\nstate postconviction court unreasonably applied this\nCourt’s decisions in Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62\n(1991), Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979), and\n——————\ndamage to happen.’ Your presence, your readiness to assist caused the\ncrime to occur and you are an accomplice. The law in the State of\nWashington says, if you’re in for a dime, you’re in for a dollar. If you’re\nthere or even if you’re not there and you’re helping in some fashion to\nbring about this crime, you are just as guilty.” App. 38.\n10               WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nIn re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), in affirming\nSarausad’s conviction in spite of ambiguous jury instruc\ntions and the “ ‘reasonable likelihood that the jury . . .\napplied the challenged instruction in a way’ that violates\nthe Constitution.” 479 F. 3d, at 683 (quoting Estelle,\nsupra, at 72). The court denied rehearing en banc over the\ndissent of five judges. Sarausad v. Porter, 503 F. 3d 822\n(2007). We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2008), and\nnow reverse.\n                               II\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a federal court may\ngrant habeas relief on a claim “adjudicated on the merits”\nin state court only if the decision “was contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). Where, as\nhere, it is the state court’s application of governing federal\nlaw that is challenged, the decision “ ‘must be shown to be\nnot only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.’ ” Mid\ndleton v. McNeil, 541 U. S. 433, 436 (2004) (per curiam)\n(quoting Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U. S. 1, 5 (2003) (per\ncuriam)); see also Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473\n(2007) (“The question under AEDPA is not whether a\nfederal court believes the state court’s determination was\nincorrect but whether that determination was unreason\nable—a substantially higher threshold”).\n   Our habeas precedent places an “especially heavy”\nburden on a defendant who, like Sarausad, seeks to show\nconstitutional error from a jury instruction that quotes a\nstate statute. Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U. S. 145, 155\n(1977). Even if there is some “ambiguity, inconsistency, or\ndeficiency” in the instruction, such an error does not nec\nessarily constitute a due process violation. Middleton,\nsupra, at 437.

California, 494\nU. S. 370, 380 (1990)). In making this determination, the\njury instruction “ ‘may not be judged in artificial isolation,’\nbut must be considered in the context of the instructions\nas a whole and the trial record.” Estelle, supra, at 72\n(quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S. 141, 147 (1973)).\nBecause it is not enough that there is some “slight possi\nbility” that the jury misapplied the instruction, Weeks v.\nAngelone, 528 U. S. 225, 236 (2000), the pertinent question\n“is ‘whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the\nentire trial that the resulting conviction violates due\nprocess,’ ” Estelle, supra, at 72 (quoting Cupp, supra, at\n147).\n                             A\n   The Washington courts reasonably concluded that the\ntrial court’s instruction to the jury was not ambiguous.\nThe instruction parroted the language of the statute,\nrequiring that an accomplice “in the commission of the\ncrime” take action “with knowledge that it will promote or\nfacilitate the commission of the crime.” App. 16–17 (em\nphasis added); Wash. Rev. Code §§9A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a)\n(2008). It is impossible to assign any meaning to this\ninstruction different from the meaning given to it by the\nWashington courts. By its plain terms, it instructed the\njury to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice “in the com\nmission of the [murder]” only if he acted “with knowledge\nthat [his conduct] will promote or facilitate the commis\nsion of the [murder].” App. 16–17.4 Because the conclu\n——————\n  4 The dissent would reverse the Washington state courts based on the\n\nalleged confusion in Washington courts, and specifically in the Wash\nington Court of Appeals on direct review, about the meaning of the\n12                   WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsion reached by the Washington courts that the jury in\nstruction was unambiguous was not objectively unreason\nable, the Court of Appeals’ 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) inquiry\nshould have ended there.5\n——————\nWashington accomplice liability statute. Post, at 2–5 (opinion of\nSOUTER, J.). But the confusion in the Court of Appeals over the appli\ncation of the statute involved the related, but legally distinct, question\nwhether an accomplice is required to share the specific intent of the\nprincipal actor under Washington law. On direct appeal, respondent\nargued that he should not have been convicted as an accomplice to\nmurder because he did not have the specific intent to kill. The Wash\nington Court of Appeals rejected that argument because “it was not\nnecessary for the State to prove Sarausad knew Ronquillo had a gun, or\nknew that there was a potential for gunplay that day” under Washing\nton law, App. to Pet. for Cert. 266a, where “accomplice liability predi\ncates criminal liability on general knowledge of a crime, rather than\nspecific knowledge of the elements of the principal’s crime,” id., at 259a.\nBut the Washington Court of Appeals never held that knowledge of a\ncompletely different crime, such as assault, would be sufficient under\nWashington law for accomplice liability for murder. See id., at 258a–\n259a; see also In re Domingo, 155 Wash. 2d 356, 367–368, 119 P. 3d\n816, 822 (2005) (“[N]either Davis nor any of this court’s decisions\nsubsequent to Davis approves of the proposition that accomplice liabil\nity attaches for any and all crimes committed by the principal so long\nas the putative accomplice knowingly aided in any one of the crimes”).\nIn other words, the Court of Appeals had evaluated whether respon\ndent’s conviction required a specific intent versus a general intent to\nkill, not whether it required knowledge of a murder versus knowledge\nof an assault—the issue under review here. Thus, the confusion in the\nstate courts referenced by the dissent has no bearing on the question\npresented in this appeal, and does not support the dissent’s argument\nthat the jury instruction in question was ambiguous.\n   5 To the extent that the Court of Appeals attempted to rewrite state\n\nlaw by proposing that the instruction should have included “an explicit\nstatement that an accomplice must have knowledge of . . . the actual\ncrime the principal intends to commit,” 479 F. 3d 671, 689–690 (CA9\n2007), it compounded its error. The Washington Supreme Court\nexpressly held that the jury instruction correctly set forth state law,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 191a, and we have repeatedly held that “it is not\nthe province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court deter\nminations on state-law questions.” Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62,\n67–68 (1991).\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

S. C. §2254(d). The\nWashington courts reasonably applied this Court’s prece\ndent when they determined that there was no “reasonable\nlikelihood” that the prosecutor’s closing argument caused\nSarausad’s jury to apply the instruction in a way that\nrelieved the State of its burden to prove every element of\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor\nconsistently argued that Sarausad was guilty as an ac\ncomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was\nfacilitating a driveby shooting. Indeed, Sarausad and\nReyes had admitted under oath that they anticipated a\nfight, Tr. 2671, 2794, and yet the prosecutor never argued\nthat their admission was a concession of accomplice liabil\nity for murder. She instead argued that Sarausad knew\nthat a shooting was intended, App. 123, because he drove\nhis car in a way that would help Ronquillo “fire those\nshots,” id., at 39. The closing argument of Sarausad’s\nattorney also homed in on the key legal question: He\nchallenged the jury to look for evidence that Sarausad\n“had knowledge that his assistance would promote or\nfacilitate the crime of premeditated murder” and argued\nthat no such evidence existed. Id., at 83.\n   Put simply, there was no evidence of ultimate juror confu\nsion as to the test for accomplice liability under Washington\nlaw. Rather, the jury simply reached a unanimous decision\nthat the State had proved Sarausad’s guilt beyond a reason\nable doubt. Indeed, every state and federal appellate court\nthat reviewed the verdict found that the evidence supporting\nSarausad’s knowledge of a shooting was legally sufficient to\nconvict him under Washington law. 479 F. 3d, at 677–683;\nSarausad, 109 Wash. App., at 844–845, 39 P. 3d, at 319.\n14               WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGiven the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction,\nalong with the jury’s failure to convict Reyes—who also had\nbeen charged as an accomplice to murder and also had ad\nmitted knowledge of a possible fight—it was not objectively\nunreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the\njury convicted Sarausad only because it believed that he,\nunlike Reyes, had knowledge of more than just a fistfight.\nThe reasoning of the Court of Appeals, which failed to review\nthe state courts’ resolution of this question through the\ndeferential lens of AEDPA, does not convince us otherwise.\n   First, the Court of Appeals found that the evidence of\nSarausad’s knowledge of the shooting was so “thin” that\nthe jury must have incorrectly believed that proof of such\nknowledge was not required. 479 F. 3d, at 692–693. That\nconclusion, however, is foreclosed by the Court of Appeals’\nown determination that the evidence was sufficient for a\nrational jury to reasonably infer that Sarausad knowingly\nfacilitated the driveby shooting. As explained above, the\nCourt of Appeals acknowledged that the evidence showed\nthat Ronquillo, while seated in Sarausad’s front passenger\nseat, tied a bandana over the lower part of his face and\npulled out a gun. Id., at 681. There also was evidence\nthat Sarausad then asked the Diablos in the other car,\n“ ‘Are you ready?’ ” before driving to the school and\n“slow[ing] his car in front of the school in a manner that\nfacilitated a drive-by shooting.” Ibid. Other gang mem\nbers testified to prior knowledge of the gun and to discuss\ning the shooting as an option during the gang meeting\nheld between trips to Ballard High School. Id., at 682.\nThere also was testimony from Sarausad that he sus\npected that members of the Bad Side Posse would be\narmed when they returned to Ballard High School, ibid.,\nmaking it reasonable to conclude that Sarausad would\nexpect his gang to be similarly prepared for the confronta\ntion. There was nothing “thin” about the evidence of\nSarausad’s guilt.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Second, the Court of Appeals faulted the prosecutor for\narguing “clearly and forcefully” for an “in for a dime, in for\na dollar” theory of accomplice liability. Id., at 693. But\nthe Washington Court of Appeals conducted an in-depth\nanalysis of the prosecutor’s argument and reasonably\nfound that it contained, at most, one problematic hypo\nthetical. Sarausad, supra, at 842–843, 39 P. 3d, at 318–\n319. The state court’s conclusion that the one hypothetical\ndid not taint the proper instruction of state law was rea\nsonable under this Court’s precedent, which acknowledges\nthat “arguments of counsel generally carry less weight\nwith a jury than do instructions from the court.” Boyde,\n494 U. S., at 384. On habeas review, the Court of Appeals\nshould not have dissected the closing argument and exag\ngerated the possible effect of one hypothetical in it. There\nwas nothing objectively unreasonable about the Washing\nton courts’ resolution of this question.6\n  Third, and last, the Court of Appeals believed that the\njury’s questions “demonstrated substantial confusion\nabout what the State was required to prove.” 479 F. 3d, at\n693. Sarausad focuses special attention on this factor,\n——————\n   6 The dissent accuses us of downplaying this ambiguous hypothetical,\n\narguing that it is so rife with improper meaning that it “infect[ed] every\nfurther statement bearing on accomplice law the prosecutor made,”\npost, at 7, and ensured that the jury misinterpreted the trial court’s\nproperly-phrased instruction. We disagree. The proper inquiry is\nwhether the state court was objectively unreasonable in concluding that\nthe instruction (which precisely tracked the language of the accomplice\nliability statute) was not warped by this one-paragraph hypothetical in\nan argument and rebuttal spanning 31 pages of the joint appendix.\nThe state court’s conclusion was not unreasonable. The hypothetical\nwas presented during closing arguments, which juries generally “vie[w]\nas the statements of advocates” rather than “as definitive and binding\nstatements of the law,” Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 384 (1990),\nand which, as a whole, made clear that the State sought a guilty verdict\nbased solely on Sarausad’s “knowledge that his assistance would\npromote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder,” App. 83; see\nalso id., at 123–124.\n16                  WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\narguing that it was the “failure to remedy” this confusion\nthat sets this case apart from previous decisions and\nestablishes that the jury likely “did not understand ac\ncomplice liability” when it returned its verdict. Brief for\nRespondent 29, 31. But this Court has determined that\nthe Constitution generally requires nothing more from a\ntrial judge than the type of answers given to the jury here.\nWeeks, 528 U. S., at 234. Where a judge “respond[s] to the\njury’s question by directing its attention to the precise\nparagraph of the constitutionally adequate instruction\nthat answers its inquiry,” and the jury asks no followup\nquestion, this Court has presumed that the jury fully\nunderstood the judge’s answer and appropriately applied\nthe jury instructions. Ibid.\n   Under this established standard, it was not objectively\nunreasonable for the state court to conclude that\nSarausad’s jury received the answers it needed to resolve\nits confusion.7 Its questions were spaced throughout seven\n\n——————\n   7 The dissent argues that we “sideste[p] the thrust of this record” by\n\nfinding that the trial judge’s answers to the jury’s questions were\nsatisfactory. Post, at 9–10. But our decision cannot turn on a de novo\nreview of the record or a finding that the answers were “the best way to\nanswer jurors’ questions,” id., at 10. On federal habeas review, this\nCourt’s inquiry is limited to whether the state court violated clearly\nestablished federal law when it held that the jury applied the correct\nstandard, in light of the answers given to its questions. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). On that issue, the state court was not objectively unrea\nsonable; the jury’s questions were answered in a manner previously\napproved by this Court, and they consistently referred the jury to the\ncorrect standard for accomplice liability in Washington. The dissent\nalso ignores the important fact that the jury convicted Ronquillo of\nfirst-degree murder, convicted respondent of second-degree murder,\nand failed to reach an agreement on Reyes’ guilt, causing a mistrial on\nthe first-degree murder charge pending against him. The jury’s as\nsignment of culpability to two of the codefendants, versus its deadlock\nover a third who, like respondent, conceded knowledge of an assault,\ndemonstrates that the jury understood the legal significance of each\ndefendant’s relative knowledge and intent with respect to the murder.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The judge pinpointed his answers to the\nparticular instructions responsive to the questions and\nthose instructions reflected state law. Under these cir\ncumstances, the state court did not act in an objectively\nunreasonable manner in finding that the jury knew the\nproper legal standard for conviction.\n                            III\n  Because the state-court decision did not result in an\n“unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Fed\neral law,” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1), the Court of Appeals\nerred in granting a writ of habeas corpus to Sarausad.\nThe judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

The underlying question is whether the\njury may have thought it could find Sarausad guilty as an\naccomplice to murder on the theory that he assisted in\nwhat he expected would be a fist fight, or whether the jury\nknew that to convict him Washington law required it to\nconclude Sarausad aided in what he understood was in\ntended to be a killing.\n   So far as the instructions addressed these alternatives,\nthe judge charged the jurors in these words:\n    “A person is an accomplice in the commission of a\n    crime if, with knowledge that it will promote or facili\n    tate the commission of the crime, he or she either:\n      “(1) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests an\n    other person to commit the crime or\n      “(2) aids or agrees to aid another person in planning\n    or committing the crime.” App. 17.\n  The majority answers the underlying question by rely\n2                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ning on the general rule that incorporating a clear statute\ninto a jury charge almost always produces an adequate\ninstruction, which the jury is assumed to follow. The\nkicker of course is that the general rule is only good if the\nincorporated statute is clear enough to require the jury to\nfind facts amounting to a violation of the law as correctly\nunderstood.\n   Does the rule apply here? The majority says it does. It\nsays the instruction quoted is unambiguous because it\nparrots the language of the Washington statute on accom\nplice liability, ante, at 11, and that “[i]t is impossible to\nassign any meaning to this instruction” and, by extension,\nthe statute, “different from the meaning given to it by the\nWashington courts,” ibid.\n   That is not, however, what the record shows. Rather\nthan a single understanding, the Washington courts have\nproduced a record of discordant positions on the meaning\nof the statute, and the Washington Court of Appeals can\nitself attest to a degree of difficulty in understanding the\nstatutory requirement sufficient to show the statute to be\nambiguous and the statute-based instruction constitution\nally inadequate: that court read the statute to mean just\nthe opposite of what the majority now claims it unambigu\nously requires.\n   On Sarausad’s direct appeal in 1998, the State Court of\nAppeals set out the principles on which it understood\naccomplice liability in Washington to be premised. It did\nnot say that the accomplice must understand that he is\naiding in the commission of the same offense the principal\nhas in mind, or the offense actually committed. Instead,\nthe Washington Court of Appeals said this:\n    “(1) To convict of accomplice liability, the State need\n    not prove that principal and accomplice shared the\n    same mental state, (2) accomplice liability predicates\n    criminal liability on general knowledge of a crime,\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Ronquillo, No.\n    35840–5–I etc. (Mar. 2, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n    233a, 258a–259a.\nIn support, the court cited State v. Davis, 101 Wash. 2d\n654, 682 P. 2d 883 (1984), in which the Supreme Court of\nWashington noted that “an accomplice, having agreed to\nparticipate in a criminal act, runs the risk of having the\nprimary actor exceed the scope of the preplanned illegal\nity.” Id., at 658, 682 P. 2d, at 886. As today’s majority\nnotes, ante, at 6, the state appellate court remarked that\nthe Washington law of accomplice liability (as it then\nunderstood it) “ ‘has been reduced to the maxim, “in for a\ndime, in for a dollar” ’ ”; the court also held that “it was not\nnecessary for the State to prove Sarausad . . . knew that\nthere was a potential for gunplay that day.” Washington\nv. Ronquillo, supra, at 235a, 266a. So much for the major\nity’s confidence that the statute-based instruction can only\nbe understood as requiring what the State Supreme Court\nnow says it requires: proof that the accomplice understood\nthat he was aiding in the commission of the very crime he\nis charged with facilitating.\n   The State Supreme Court clarified this requirement two\nyears after the Court of Appeals held against Sarausad.\nIn State v. Roberts, 142 Wash. 2d 471, 14 P. 3d 713 (2000),\nthe Supreme Court of Washington held that the Court of\nAppeals’s “in for a dime, in for a dollar” view of accomplice\nliability was a misreading of the statute and a flat-out\nmisstatement of law. In Roberts, the State Supreme Court\nrevisited Davis, which it explained as standing for the\nprinciple “that an accomplice need not have specific\nknowledge of every element of the crime committed by the\n4                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nprincipal, provided he has general knowledge of that\nspecific crime.” 142 Wash. 2d, at 512, 14 P. 3d, at 736.\nAlthough a “general knowledge” of “that specific crime”\nintended by a confederate and eventually committed will\nsuffice for the mental element of accomplice liability, mere\n“knowledge by the accomplice that the principal intends to\ncommit ‘a crime’ does not impose strict liability for any\nand all offenses that follow.” Id., at 513, 14 P. 3d, at 736.\nIn other words, it was incorrect to read the statute as the\nSupreme Court of Washington had arguably done in Davis\n(and the State Court of Appeals certainly did in this case),\nto mean that anyone who agrees “to participate in a crimi\nnal act . . . runs the risk of [accomplice liability for a more\nserious crime if] the primary actor exceed[s] the scope of\nthe preplanned illegality,” 101 Wash. 2d, at 658, 682 P. 2d,\nat 886. The reductive maxim “in for a dime, in for a dol\nlar” was now understood to be a distortion of Washington’s\naccomplice liability law.\n  The Washington Court of Appeals said as much when\nSarausad appeared before it the second time, seeking\npostconviction relief: “[Sarausad] points out, and correctly\nso, that this court decided [his direct] appeal on the prem\nise that ‘in for a dime, in for a dollar’ correctly character\nized Washington accomplice liability law. We said that ‘an\naccomplice, “having agreed to participate in a criminal act,\nruns the risk of having the primary actor exceed the scope\nof the preplanned illegality.” ’ ” Sarausad v. Washington,\n109 Wash. App. 824, 833–834, 39 P. 3d 308, 313 (2001).\nThe Court of Appeals said that it had “erred” in determin\ning that it was unnecessary for the State to prove\nSarausad knew he was facilitating a drive-by shooting.\nId., at 837, 39 P. 3d, at 315.\n  This profession of judicial error in understanding the\nlaw is the touchmark not of a clear statute, but of an\nindistinct or perplexing one, which the law calls ambigu\nous.

Ante, at 11. Given\nthat error on the majority’s part, it has not justified its\nreversal of the Ninth Circuit by showing that the instruc\ntion was clear.*\n   There remains the question whether the majority’s\nsecond conclusion is also unjustifiable: despite inadequate\ninstruction, did the jurors nevertheless apply the correct\nview of state law, which only recently, and after the trial,\nattained its current clarity? The state postconviction court\nfound no reasonable likelihood that the jurors failed to\napply a correct understanding of accomplice liability,\nSarausad v. Washington, supra, at 843–844, 39 P. 3d, at\n318–319, and Sarausad’s burden here (on federal habeas)\n——————\n   * As the majority notes, ante, at 11, n. 4, in the Washington Court of\nAppeals on direct review, Sarausad’s counsel claimed that state law\nrequired that an accomplice to murder have a specific intent to kill (or\naid in killing). The Court of Appeals rejected this position. Contrary to\nthe majority view, ante, at 12, n. 4, in gauging the adequacy of an\ninstruction incorporating statutory terms, the fact that defense counsel\nmay have asked for too much does nothing to lessen the pertinence of\nopaque state law or its uncertainty in the minds of the state judges.\nThe Court of Appeals in its very response to counsel’s argument demon\nstrated its misunderstanding of the scope of Washington accomplice\nliability law: “accomplice liability predicates criminal liability on\ngeneral knowledge of a crime.” Washington v. Ronquillo, No. 35840–5–\nI etc. (Mar. 2, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 233a, 259a (emphasis added).\nFor that matter, the Court of Appeals subsequently disavowed the very\nstatement used by the majority to support its contention that the court\nwas focused solely on the issue of specific intent. The court, in the\npostconviction proceedings, concluded that it was in fact necessary for\nthe State to prove Sarausad knew Ronquillo had a gun, or knew there\nwas potential for gunplay that day. Sarausad v. Washington, 109\nWash. App. 824, 837, 39 P. 3d 308, 315 (2001). This knowledge would\nhave been necessary regardless of whether the law required Sarausad\nto have specific or general intent to kill, unless, of course, accomplice\nliability was predicated on an “in for a dime, in for a dollar” theory of\nliability and knowledge of a fistfight could suffice.\n6               WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nis to demonstrate that the state court was objectively\nunreasonable in drawing this conclusion, 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1). The District Court and the Ninth Circuit\nfound he had done just that, whereas the majority today\ninsists those courts were wrong.\n  The majority’s position is simply unrealistic. Even a\njuror with a preternatural grasp of the statutory subtlety\nwould have lost his grip after listening to the prosecutor’s\nclosing argument, which first addressed the state law of\naccomplice liability with a statement that was flatout\nerror, followed that with a confusing argument that could\nhave reflected either the correct or the erroneous view,\nand concluded with an argument that could have fit either\ntheory but ended with a phrase defined to express the\nerroneous one.\n  In her first pass at the subject, the prosecutor said\nunequivocally that assaultive, not murderous, intent on\nSarausad’s part would suffice for the intent required of an\naccomplice to murder.\n    “Let me give you a good example of accomplice liabil\n    ity. A friend comes up to you and says, ‘Hold this per\n    son’s arms while I hit him.’ You say, ‘Okay, I don’t\n    like that person, anyway.’ You hold the arms. The\n    person not only gets assaulted, he gets killed. You are\n    an accomplice and you can’t come back and say, ‘Well,\n    I only intended this much damage to happen.’ Your\n    presence, your readiness to assist caused the crime to\n    occur and you are an accomplice. The law in the State\n    of Washington says, if you’re in for a dime, you’re in\n    for a dollar. If you’re there or even if you’re not there\n    and you’re helping in some fashion to bring about this\n    crime, you are just as guilty.” App. 38.\nThus, in what the majority would launder into “one prob\nlematic hypothetical,” ante, at 15, the prosecutor intro\nduced the “in for a dime, in for a dollar” locution, which\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nshe defined to mean that readiness to aid in the commis\nsion of any crime thought to be intended by the principal\nis enough intent for accomplice liability for whatever\ncrime the principal actually commits. This lead-off mis\nstatement of the law, never corrected by the trial judge,\ninfects every further statement bearing on accomplice law\nthe prosecutor made, for into each effort she consistently\nintroduced the viral catchphrase “in for a dime, in for a\ndollar.”\n  In a second reference to accomplice law, the prosecutor\ndiscussed gang mentality and used the phrase, without\nmodifying her earlier explanation of its legal meaning,\nthen followed up with a reference to the evidence that\ncould have fit either the erroneous theory or the law as\ncorrected by Roberts:\n      “Mr. Sarausad [was] present and . . . certainly ready\n    to assist. And I remind you, too, what you heard not\n    only from . . . the gang expert in this case, but from\n    [gang] member after [gang] member who told you that\n    an affront to one is an affront to all, ‘When you disre\n    spect me you disrespect my gang.’ . . .\n      “They were all there that day . . . ready to back each\n    other up in whatever happened.

An af\n    front to one is an affront to all.” App. 40–41.\n   The confusion of the correct and erroneous theories of\nliability showed up again in the prosecutor’s final rebuttal:\n      “Mr. Sarausad’s lawyer says that an accomplice has\n    to have the same mental state as the person doing the\n8                WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\n    shooting. . . . Not true, not true. And that’s not what\n    the instruction says.\n       “And I’ve told you the old adage, you’re in for a\n    dime, you’re in for a dollar. If their logic was correct,\n    they’re not ever an accomplice to anything. The get\n    away driver for a bank robbery would say, ‘I just told\n    him to rob them, I didn’t tell him to shoot him, I didn’t\n    do anything.’ The example I gave you earlier, ‘I just\n    told my friend to hold the arms down of this person\n    while he hit him, I didn’t tell him to kill him, I’m not\n    guilty of anything.’ If you’re in for a dime, you’re in\n    for a dollar.\n       “When they rode down to Ballard High School that\n    last time, I say they knew what they were up to. They\n    knew they were there to commit a crime, to disrespect\n    the gang, to fight, to shoot, to get that respect back. A\n    fist didn’t work, pushing didn’t work. Shouting in\n    sults at them didn’t work. Shooting was going to\n    work. In for a dime, you’re in for a dollar.” Id., at\n    123–124.\nIn the prosecutor’s jumble of rules, one proposition is both\nclear and clearly erroneous: the statement of law, “in for a\ndime, in for a dollar.” It unmistakably contradicts the\nconstruction for which Sarausad’s counsel correctly ar\ngued, which would have required the jury to find that\nSarausad understood that the object was killing in order\nto find him guilty as an accomplice to murder. Id., at 83–\n84.\n    The point here is not to excoriate the prosecutor, who\ntried this case in the period between Roberts and Davis\nand could fairly assume that her expansive (“in for a dime\n. . .”) view of accomplice liability was good law in her State.\nThe point is just the obvious one that cannot be evaded\nwithout playing make-believe with the record: an uncer\ntain instruction by the trial judge was combined with\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                     SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\nconfounding prosecutorial argument incorporating what\nthe state courts now acknowledge was a clearly-erroneous\nstatement of law, in contrast to the view of the law argued\nby defense counsel. In these circumstances jury confu-\nsion is all but inevitable and jury error the reasonable\nlikelihood.\n   If there were any doubt about that, one could simply\nlook at the record of the jury’s deliberations, in the course\nof which the jurors repeatedly asked the court to clarify\nthe law on accomplice liability. They began deliberating\non Friday, October 21, 1994, and the following Tuesday,\nthey asked (as to the instructions laying out the crime of\nfirst-degree murder and the required premeditation),\n“does the ‘intent’ apply to (the defendant only) or to (the\ndefendant or his accomplice)?” App. 126. The judge re\nplied, “Refer to instructions 46 and 47 and consider your\ninstructions as a whole.” Ibid. Three days later, October\n28, this time in reference to the second-degree murder\ninstructions, the jury enquired a second time about ac\ncomplice liability, asking whether “intentional appl[ies] to\nonly the defendant or only his accomplice?” Id., at 128.\nThe judge’s response was nearly identical to his first one:\n“Refer to instructions 45 & 46 and consider the instruc\ntions as a whole.” Ibid. The following Monday, the jury\nreturned to deliberations and requested help yet again,\nspelling out its confusion: “We are having difficulty agree\ning on the legal definition and concept of ‘accomplice.’ . . .\n[W]hen a person willing[ly] participates in a group activ\nity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed\nby anyone in the group?” Id., at 129. Once again, the\njudge sent the jurors back to the written charge: “Refer to\ninstructions . . . 45, 46, 47, and 48 and consider your in\nstructions as a whole.” Ibid.\n   The majority sidesteps the thrust of this record by sug\ngesting that the jurors failed to let the court know of any\nconfusion: it says the jurors’ questions “involved different\n10              WADDINGTON v. SARAUSAD\n\n                    SOUTER, J., dissenting\n\ncriminal charges, and implicated the interrelation of\nseveral different jury instructions.” Ante, at 17. But this\nsimply ignores the disclosure obviously common to all\nthose questions: the jurors did not understand the state of\nmind the prosecution had to prove for accomplice liability.\nTheir final question makes this unmistakable.\n  The majority says, in any case, that the judge’s repeated\nreferences back to the written instructions were enough\nand that “it was not objectively unreasonable for the state\ncourt to conclude that [the] jury received the answers it\nneeded to resolve its confusion.” Ante, at 16. But after the\njurors asked three times? In many trials, reference back\nto written instructions would be the best way to answer\njurors’ questions, which may reflect uncertain memory,\nnot deficient instruction. But not in this case: the accom\nplice liability instruction was defective owing to the ambi\nguity of the statutory language it incorporated, and its\ndeficiency was underscored by the prosecutor’s erroneous\nargument. Telling the jurors to read an inadequate in\nstruction three more times did nothing to improve upon it\nor enlighten the readers. The District Court and the\nNinth Circuit drew the only conclusion reasonably possible\non this record.
