Duncan, Assistant Chief Defender, Counsel of Record, Ernest G. Lannet, Senior Deputy Public Defender, Office of Public Defense Services, Appellate Division, Salem, OR, for Respondent.</p>\n<p>Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case concerns the scope of the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee, as construed in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Those decisions are rooted in the historic jury function\u0097determining whether the prosecution has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. They hold that it is within the jury's province to determine any fact (other than the existence of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular offense. Thus far, the Court has not extended the <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely</i> line of decisions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the historic grounding for the decisions. The question here presented concerns a sentencing function in which the jury traditionally played no part: When a defendant has been tried and convicted of multiple offenses, each involving discrete sentencing prescriptions, does the Sixth Amendment mandate jury determination of any fact declared necessary to the imposition of consecutive, in lieu of concurrent, sentences?</p>\n<p>Most States continue the common-law tradition: They entrust to judges' unfettered discretion the decision whether sentences for discrete offenses shall be served consecutively or concurrently. In some States, sentences for multiple offenses are presumed to run consecutively, but sentencing judges may order concurrent sentences upon finding cause therefor. Other States, including Oregon, constrain judges' discretion by requiring them to find certain facts before imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences. It is undisputed that States may proceed on the first two tracks without transgressing the Sixth Amendment. The sole issue in dispute, then, is whether the Sixth Amendment, as construed in <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely,</i> precludes the mode of proceeding chosen by Oregon and several of her sister States. We hold, in light of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*715</span> historical practice and the authority of States over administration of their criminal justice systems, that the Sixth Amendment does not exclude Oregon's choice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>State laws, as just observed, prescribe a variety of approaches to the decision whether a defendant's sentences for distinct offenses shall run concurrently or consecutively. Oregon might have followed the prevailing pattern by placing the decision within the trial court's discretion in all,<sup>[1]</sup> or almost all,<sup>[2]</sup> circumstances. Instead, Oregon and several other States have adopted a more restrained approach: they provide for judicial discretion, but constrain its exercise. In these States, to impose consecutive sentences, judges must make certain predicate fact findings.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The controlling statute in Oregon provides that sentences shall run concurrently unless the judge finds statutorily described facts. Ore.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 137.123(1) (2007). In most cases, finding such facts permits\u0097 but does not require\u0097the judge to order consecutive sentences.<sup>[4]</sup> Specifically, an Oregon judge may order consecutive sentences \"[i]f a defendant is simultaneously sentenced for criminal offenses that do not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\" \u00a7 137.123(2). If the offenses <i>do</i> arise from the same course of conduct, the judge may still impose consecutive sentences if she finds either:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) That the criminal offense ... was an indication of defendant's willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) The criminal offense ... caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or ... to a different victim....\" \u00a7 137.123(5).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>On two occasions between December 1996 and July 1997, respondent Thomas Eugene Ice entered an apartment in the complex he managed and sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl. 343 Ore. 248, 250, 170 P.3d 1049, 1050 (2007). An Oregon jury convicted Ice of six crimes. For each of the two incidents, the jury found him guilty of first-degree burglary for entering with the intent to commit sexual abuse; first-degree sexual assault for touching the victim's vagina; and first-degree sexual assault for touching the victim's breasts. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>At sentencing, the judge made findings, pursuant to \u00a7 137.123, that permitted the imposition of consecutive sentences. First, the judge found that the two burglaries constituted \"separate incident[s].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 255, 170 P.3d, at 1053 (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on that finding, the judge had, and exercised, discretion to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*716</span> impose the two burglary sentences consecutively. <i>Ibid.;</i> see \u00a7 137.123(2).</p>\n<p>Second, the court found that each offense of touching the victim's vagina met the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7 137.123(5): Ice displayed a \"willingness to commit more than one ... offense\" during each criminal episode, and his conduct \"caused or created a risk of causing greater, qualitatively different loss, injury, or harm to the victim.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 253, 170 P.3d, at 1051 (internal quotation marks omitted). These findings gave the judge discretion to impose the sentence for each of those sexual assault offenses consecutive to the associated burglary sentence. The court elected to do so. <i>Ibid.</i> The court ordered, however, that the sentences for touching the victim's breasts run concurrently with the other sentences. <i>Ibid.</i> In total, the court sentenced Ice to 340 months' imprisonment. App. 46-87.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Ice appealed his sentences. In relevant part, he argued that he had a Sixth Amendment right to have the jury, not the sentencing judge, find the facts that permitted the imposition of consecutive sentences. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment without opinion. 178 Ore.App. 415, 39 P.3d 291 (2001).</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court granted Ice's petition for review and reversed, 4 to 2. 343 Ore., at 250, 170 P.3d, at 1050.<sup>[6]</sup> In the majority's view, the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> applied, because the imposition of consecutive sentences increased \"the quantum of punishment\" imposed. 343 Ore., at 265, 170 P.3d, at 1058. The dissenting justices concluded that \"[n]either the holding in <i>Apprendi</i> nor its reasoning support[ed] extending that decision to the question of consecutive sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 267, 170 P.3d 1049, 170 P.3d, at 1059 (opinion of Kistler, J.). State high courts have divided over whether the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> governs consecutive sentencing decisions.<sup>[7]</sup> We granted review to resolve the question. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1657, 170 L.Ed.2d 353 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Federal Constitution's jury-trial guarantee assigns the determination of certain facts to the jury's exclusive province. Under that guarantee, this Court held in <i>Apprendi,</i> \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p>We have applied <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty, <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 602, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), facts allowing a sentence exceeding the \"standard\" range in Washington's sentencing system, <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 304-305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, and facts prompting an elevated sentence under then-mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Most <span class=\"star-pagination\">*717</span> recently, in <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> 549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), we applied <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule to facts permitting imposition of an \"upper term\" sentence under California's determinate sentencing law. All of these decisions involved sentencing for a discrete crime, not\u0097as here\u0097for multiple offenses different in character or committed at different times.</p>\n<p>Our application of <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule must honor the \"longstanding common-law practice\" in which the rule is rooted. <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at 281, 127 S.Ct. 856. The rule's animating principle is the preservation of the jury's historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense. See <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 477, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Guided by that principle, our opinions make clear that the Sixth Amendment does not countenance legislative encroachment on the jury's traditional domain. See <i>id.,</i> at 497, 120 S.Ct. 2348. We accordingly considered whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within \"the domain of the jury ... by those who framed the Bill of Rights.\" <i>Harris v. United States,</i> 536 U.S. 545, 557, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (plurality opinion). In undertaking this inquiry, we remain cognizant that administration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the basic sovereign prerogatives States retain. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Patterson v. New York,</i> 432 U.S. 197, 201, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977).</p>\n<p>These twin considerations\u0097historical practice and respect for state sovereignty\u0097counsel against extending <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule to the imposition of sentences for discrete crimes. The decision to impose sentences consecutively is not within the jury function that \"extends down centuries into the common law.\" <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 477, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Instead, specification of the regime for administering multiple sentences has long been considered the prerogative of state legislatures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The historical record demonstrates that the jury played no role in the decision to impose sentences consecutively or concurrently. Rather, the choice rested exclusively with the judge. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7 636, pp. 649-650 (2d ed.1858) (\"[W]hen there are two or more convictions, on which sentence remains to be pronounced; the judgment may direct, that each succeeding period of imprisonment shall commence on the termination of the period next preceding.\"); A. Campbell, Law of Sentencing \u00a7 9:22, p. 425 (3d ed.2004) (\"Firmly rooted in common law is the principle that the selection of either concurrent or consecutive sentences rests within the discretion of sentencing judges.\"). This was so in England before the founding of our Nation,<sup>[8]</sup> and in the early American States.<sup>[9]</sup> Ice \"has no quarrel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*718</span> with [this account] of consecutive sentencing practices through the ages.\" Brief for Respondent 32. The historical record further indicates that a judge's imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences was the prevailing practice.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>In light of this history, legislative reforms regarding the imposition of multiple sentences do not implicate the core concerns that prompted our decision in <i>Apprendi.</i> There is no encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jury's domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused. Instead, the defendant\u0097who historically may have faced consecutive sentences by default\u0097has been granted by some modern legislatures statutory protections meant to temper the harshness of the historical practice.</p>\n<p>It is no answer that, as Ice argues, \"he was <i>`entitled'</i> to\" concurrent sentences absent the fact findings Oregon law requires. Brief for Respondent 43. In Ice's view, because \"the Oregon Legislature deviated from tradition\" and enacted a statute that hinges consecutive sentences on fact findings, <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule must be imported. Brief for Respondent 33. As we have described, the scope of the constitutional jury right must be informed by the historical role of the jury at common law. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Williams v. Florida,</i> 399 U.S. 78, 98-100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970). It is therefore not the case that, as Ice suggests, the federal constitutional right attaches to every contemporary state-law \"entitlement\" to predicate findings.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, <i>Cunningham,</i> upon which Ice heavily relies, does not control his case. As stated earlier, we held in <i>Cunningham</i> that the facts permitting imposition of an elevated \"upper term\" sentence for a particular crime fell within the jury's province. 549 U.S., at 274, 127 S.Ct. 856 (internal quotation marks omitted). The assignment of such a finding to the sentencing judge implicates <i>Apprendi</i>'s core concern: a legislative attempt to \"remove from the [province of the] jury\" the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense. <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (internal quotation marks omitted). We had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no erosion of the jury's traditional role was at stake. <i>Cunningham</i> thus does not impede our conclusion that, as <i>Apprendi</i>'s core concern is inapplicable to the issue at hand, so too is the Sixth Amendment's restriction on judge-found facts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>States' interest in the development of their penal systems, and their historic dominion in this area, also counsel against the extension of <i>Apprendi</i> that Ice requests. Beyond question, the authority of States over the administration of their criminal justice systems lies at the core of their sovereign status. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Patterson,</i> 432 U.S., at 201, 97 S.Ct. 2319 (\"It goes without saying that preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government.\"). We have long recognized the role of the States as laboratories for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*719</span> devising solutions to difficult legal problems. See <i>New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann,</i> 285 U.S. 262, 311, 52 S.Ct. 371, 76 L.Ed. 747 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). This Court should not diminish that role absent impelling reason to do so.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasis that state legislative innovations like Oregon's seek to rein in the discretion judges possessed at common law to impose consecutive sentences at will. Limiting judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences serves the \"salutary objectives\" of promoting sentences proportionate to \"the gravity of the offense,\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 308, 124 S.Ct. 2531, and of reducing disparities in sentence length, see 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 26.3(f) (3d ed.2007). All agree that a scheme making consecutive sentences the rule, and concurrent sentences the exception, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal. To hem in States by holding that they may not equally choose to make concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences the exception, would make scant sense. Neither <i>Apprendi</i> nor our Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacketing the States in that manner.</p>\n<p>Further, it is unclear how many other state initiatives would fall under Ice's proposed expansion of <i>Apprendi.</i> As 17 States have observed in an <i>amici</i> brief supporting Oregon, States currently permit judges to make a variety of sentencing determinations other than the length of incarceration. Trial judges often find facts about the nature of the offense or the character of the defendant in determining, for example, the length of supervised release following service of a prison sentence; required attendance at drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community service; and the imposition of statutorily prescribed fines and orders of restitution. See Brief for State of Indiana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11. Intruding <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule into these decisions on sentencing choices or accoutrements surely would cut the rule loose from its moorings.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the expansion that Ice seeks would be difficult for States to administer. The predicate facts for consecutive sentences could substantially prejudice the defense at the guilt phase of a trial. As a result, bifurcated or trifurcated trials might often prove necessary. Brief for State of Indiana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 14-15. We will not so burden the Nation's trial courts absent any genuine affront to <i>Apprendi</i>'s instruction.</p>\n<p>We recognize that not every state initiative will be in harmony with Sixth Amendment ideals. But as we have previously emphasized, \"structural democratic constraints exist to discourage legislatures from\" pernicious manipulation of the rules we articulate. <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 490, n. 16, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In any event, if confronted with such a manipulation, \"we would be required to question whether the [legislative measure] was constitutional under this Court's prior decisions.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 491, n. 16, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The Oregon statute before us today raises no such concern.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Members of this Court have warned against \"wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the <i>Apprendi</i> doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at 295, 127 S.Ct. 856 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The jury-trial right is best honored through a \"principled rationale\" that applies the rule of the <i>Apprendi</i> cases \"within the central sphere of their concern.\" 549 U.S., at 295, 127 S.Ct. 856. Our disposition today\u0097upholding an Oregon statute that assigns to judges a decision that has not traditionally belonged to the jury\u0097is faithful to that aim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*720</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice SOUTER, and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The rule of <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is clear: Any fact\u0097other than that of a prior conviction\u0097that increases the maximum punishment to which a defendant may be sentenced must be admitted by the defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. Oregon's sentencing scheme allows judges rather than juries to find the facts necessary to commit defendants to longer prison sentences, and thus directly contradicts what we held eight years ago and have reaffirmed several times since. The Court's justification of Oregon's scheme is a virtual copy of the dissents in those cases.</p>\n<p>The judge in this case could not have imposed a sentence of consecutive prison terms without making the factual finding that the defendant caused \"separate harms\" to the victim by the acts that produced two convictions. See 343 Ore. 248, 268, 170 P.3d 1049, 1060 (2007) (Kistler, J., dissenting). There can thus be no doubt that the judge's factual finding was \"essential to\" the punishment he imposed. <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 232, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). That \"should be the end of the matter.\" <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 313, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p>Instead, the Court attempts to distinguish Oregon's sentencing scheme by reasoning that the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> applies only to the length of a sentence for an individual crime and not to the total sentence for a defendant. I cannot understand why we would make such a strange exception to the treasured right of trial by jury. Neither the reasoning of the <i>Apprendi</i> line of cases, nor any distinctive history of the factfinding necessary to imposition of consecutive sentences, nor (of course) logic supports such an odd rule.</p>\n<p>We have taken pains to reject artificial limitations upon the facts subject to the jury-trial guarantee. We long ago made clear that the guarantee turns upon the penal consequences attached to the fact, and not to its formal definition as an element of the crime. <i>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</i> 421 U.S. 684, 698, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). More recently, we rejected the contention that the \"aggravating circumstances\" that qualify a defendant for the death penalty did not have to be found by the jury. \"If,\" we said, \"a State makes an increase in a defendant's authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u0097no matter how the State labels it\u0097must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> 536 U.S. 584, 602, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). A bare three years ago, in rejecting the contention that the facts determining application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines did not have to be found by the jury, we again set forth the pragmatic, practical, nonformalistic rule in terms that cannot be mistaken: The jury must \"find the existence of `\"any particular fact\"' that the law makes essential to [a defendant's] punishment.\" <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 232, 125 S.Ct. 738 (quoting <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 301).</p>\n<p>This rule leaves no room for a formalistic distinction between facts bearing on the number of years of imprisonment that a defendant will serve for one count (subject to the rule of <i>Apprendi</i>) and facts bearing on how many years will be served in total (now not subject to <i>Apprendi</i>). There is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*721</span> no doubt that consecutive sentences are a \"greater punishment\" than concurrent sentences, <i>Apprendi, supra,</i> at 494, 120 S.Ct. 2348 We have hitherto taken note of the reality that \"a concurrent sentence is traditionally imposed as a less severe sanction than a consecutive sentence.\" <i>Ralston v. Robinson,</i> 454 U.S. 201, 216, n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 233, 70 L.Ed.2d 345 (1981) (emphasis deleted). The decision to impose consecutive sentences alters the single consequence most important to convicted noncapital defendants: their date of release from prison. For many defendants, the difference between consecutive and concurrent sentences is more important than a jury verdict of innocence on any single count: Two consecutive 10-year sentences are in most circumstances a more severe punishment than any number of concurrent 10-year sentences.</p>\n<p>To support its distinction-without-a-difference, the Court puts forward the same (the <i>very</i> same) arguments regarding the history of sentencing that were rejected by <i>Apprendi.</i> Here, it is entirely irrelevant that common-law judges had discretion to impose either consecutive or concurrent sentences, <i>ante,</i> at 717-718; just as there it was entirely irrelevant that common-law judges had discretion to impose greater or lesser sentences (within the prescribed statutory maximum) for individual convictions. There is no Sixth Amendment problem with a system that exposes defendants to a known range of sentences after a guilty verdict: \"In a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail.\" <i>Blakely, supra,</i> at 309, 124 S.Ct. 2531. The same analysis applies to a system where both consecutive and concurrent sentences are authorized after only a jury verdict of guilt; the burglar-rapist knows he is risking consecutive sentences. Our concern here is precisely the same as our concern in <i>Apprendi:</i> What happens when a State breaks from the common-law practice of discretionary sentences and permits the imposition of an elevated sentence only upon the showing of extraordinary facts? In such a system, the defendant \"is <i>entitled</i> to\" the lighter sentence \"and by reason of the Sixth Amendment[,] the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury.\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 309, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>The Court protests that in this case there is no \"encroachment\" on or \"erosion\" of the jury's role because traditionally it was for the judge to determine whether there would be concurrent terms. <i>Ante,</i> at 718-719. Alas, this argument too was made and rejected in <i>Apprendi.</i> The jury's role was not diminished, the <i>Apprendi</i> dissent contended, because it was traditionally up to judges, not juries, to determine what the sentence would be. 530 U.S., at 556, 559, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The Court's opinion acknowledged that in the 19th century it was the practice to leave sentencing up to the judges, within limits fixed by law. But, it said, that practice had no bearing upon whether the jury must find the fact where a law conditions the higher sentence upon the fact. The jury's role <i>is</i> diminished when the length of a sentence is made to depend upon a fact removed from its determination. <i>Id.,</i> at 482-483, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The same is true here.</p>\n<p>The Court then observes that the results of the Oregon system could readily be achieved, instead, by a system in which consecutive sentences are the default rule but judges are permitted to impose concurrent sentences when they find certain facts. <i>Ante,</i> at 718-719. Undoubtedly the Sixth Amendment permits a system in which judges are authorized (or even required) to impose consecutive sentences unless the defendant proves additional facts to the Court's satisfaction. See <i>ibid.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*722</span> But the permissibility of that alternative means of achieving the same end obviously does not distinguish <i>Apprendi,</i> because the same argument (the <i>very</i> same argument) was raised and squarely rejected in that case:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the defendant can escape the statutory maximum by showing, for example, that he is a war veteran, then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorized by the verdict according to statute, nor is the judge imposing upon the defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone. Core concerns animating the jury and burden-of-proof requirements are thus absent from such a scheme.\" 530 U.S., at 491, n. 16, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, the Court abandons its effort to provide analytic support for its decision, and turns to what it thinks to be the \"`salutary objectives'\" of Oregon's scheme. <i>Ante,</i> at 719. \"Limiting judicial discretion,\" we are told, promotes sentences proportionate to the gravity of the offense, and reduces disparities in sentence length. <i>Ibid.</i> The same argument (the <i>very</i> same argument) was made and rejected in <i>Booker,</i> see 543 U.S., at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, and <i>Blakely,</i> see 542 U.S., at 313, 124 S.Ct. 2531. The protection of the Sixth Amendment does not turn on this Court's opinion of whether an alternative scheme is good policy, or whether the legislature had a compassionate heart in adopting it. The right to trial by jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a given, and <i>all</i> legislative policymaking\u0097good and bad, heartless and compassionate\u0097 must work within the confines of that reality. Of course the Court probably exaggerates the benign effect of Oregon's scheme, as is suggested by the defense bar's vigorous objection, evidenced by the participation of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <i>amicus</i> in favor of respondent. Even that exaggeration is a replay of the rejected dissent in one of our prior cases. There the Court responded: \"It is hard to believe that the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was somehow duped into arguing for the wrong side.\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 312, 124 S.Ct. 2531</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court summons up the parade of horribles assembled by the <i>amicus</i> brief of 17 States supporting Oregon. It notes that \"[t]rial judges often find facts\" in connection with \"a variety of sentencing determinations other than the length of incarceration,\" and worries that even their ability to set the length of supervised release, impose community service, or order entry into a drug rehabilitation program, may be called into question. <i>Ante,</i> at 719. But if these courses reduce rather than augment the punishment that the jury verdict imposes, there is no problem. The last horrible the Court invokes is the prospect of bifurcated or even trifurcated trials in order to have the jury find the facts essential to consecutive sentencing without prejudicing the defendant's merits case. <i>Ibid.</i> That is another <i>d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu</i> and <i>d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9;</i> we have watched it parade past before, in several of our <i>Apprendi</i>-related opinions, and have not saluted. See <i>Blakely, supra,</i> at 336-337, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (BREYER, J., dissenting); <i>Apprendi, supra,</i> at 557, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (same).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court's peroration says that \"[t]he jury-trial right is best honored through a `principled rationale' that applies the rule of the <i>Apprendi</i> cases `within the central sphere of their concern.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 719 (quoting <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> 549 U.S. 270, 295, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)). Undoubtedly so. But we have hitherto <span class=\"star-pagination\">*723</span> considered \"the central sphere of their concern\" to be facts necessary to the increase of the defendant's sentence beyond what the jury verdict alone justifies. \"If the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 290, 127 S.Ct. 856 (opinion of the Court). If the doubling or tripling of a defendant's jail time through fact-dependent consecutive sentencing does not meet this description, nothing does. And as for a \"principled rationale\": The Court's reliance upon a distinction without a difference, and its repeated exhumation of arguments dead and buried by prior cases, seems to me the epitome of the opposite. Today's opinion muddies the waters, and gives cause to doubt whether the Court is willing to stand by <i>Apprendi</i>'s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>E.g.,</i> Connecticut (Conn.

ICE\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OREGON\n\n   No. 07\u2013901.      Argued October 14, 2008\u2014Decided January 14, 2009\nRespondent Ice twice entered an 11-year-old girl\u2019s residence and sexu\n  ally assaulted her. For each of the incidents, an Oregon jury found\n  Ice guilty of first-degree burglary for entering with the intent to\n  commit sexual abuse; first-degree sexual assault for touching the vic\n  tim\u2019s vagina; and first-degree sexual assault for touching her breasts.\n  Ice was sentenced under a state statute providing, generally, for con\n  current sentences, Ore. Rev. Stat. \u00a7137.123(1), but allowing the judge\n  to impose consecutive sentences in these circumstances: (1) when \u201ca\n  defendant is simultaneously sentenced for . . . offenses that do not\n  arise from the same . . . course of conduct,\u201d \u00a7137.123(2), and (2) when\n  offenses arise from the same course of conduct, if the judge finds ei\n  ther \u201c(a) [t]hat the . . . offense . . . was an indication of defendant\u2019s\n  willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or . . . \u201c(b) [t]he\n  . . . offense . . . caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualita\n  tively different . . . harm to the victim,\u201d \u00a7137.123(5). The trial judge\n  first found that the two burglaries constituted separate incidents and\n  exercised his discretion to impose consecutive sentences for those\n  crimes under \u00a7137.123(2). The court then found that each offense of\n  touching the victim\u2019s vagina met \u00a7137.123(5)\u2019s two criteria, giving the\n  judge discretion to impose the sentences for those offenses consecu\n  tive to the two associated burglary sentences. The court elected to do\n  so, but ordered that the sentences for touching the victim\u2019s breasts\n  run concurrently with the other sentences. On appeal, Ice argued, in\n  ter alia, that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional under Ap\n  prendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, and Blakely v. Washington,\n  542 U. S. 296, holding that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury-trial guaran\n  tee requires that the jury, rather than the judge, determine any fact\n  (other than the existence of a prior conviction) that increases the\n  maximum punishment authorized for a particular crime. The appel\n2                           OREGON v. ICE\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    late court affirmed, but the Oregon Supreme Court reversed, holding\n    that the Apprendi rule applied because the imposition of consecutive\n    sentences increased Ice\u2019s quantum of punishment.\nHeld: In light of historical practice and the States\u2019 authority over ad\n ministration of their criminal justice systems, the Sixth Amendment\n does not inhibit States from assigning to judges, rather than to juries,\n the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather\n than concurrent, sentences for multiple offenses. Pp. 5\u201311.\n    (a) The Court declines to extend the Apprendi and Blakely line of\n decisions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the his\n toric grounding for the decisions. The Court\u2019s application of Ap\n prendi\u2019s rule must honor the \u201clongstanding common-law practice\u201d in\n which the rule is rooted. Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270,\n 281. The rule\u2019s animating principle is the preservation of the jury\u2019s\n historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the\n trial for an alleged offense. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477. Because\n the Sixth Amendment does not countenance legislative encroachment\n on the jury\u2019s traditional domain, see id., at 497, the Court considers\n whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within the\n jury\u2019s domain by the Bill of Rights\u2019 framers, Harris v. United States,\n 536 U. S. 545, 557. In so doing, the Court is also cognizant that ad\n ministration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the basic\n sovereign prerogatives States retain. See, e.g., Patterson v. New\n York, 432 U. S. 197, 201. These twin considerations\u2014historical prac\n tice and respect for state sovereignty\u2014counsel against extending Ap\n prendi to the imposition of sentences for discrete crimes. P. 6.\n    (b) The historical record demonstrates that both in England before\n this Nation\u2019s founding and in the early American States, the common\n law generally entrusted the decision whether sentences for discrete\n offenses should be served consecutively or concurrently to judges\u2019 un\n fettered discretion, assigning no role in the determination to the jury.\n Thus, legislative reforms regarding the imposition of multiple sen\n tences do not implicate the core concerns that prompted the Court\u2019s\n decision in Apprendi. There is no encroachment here by the judge\n upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jury\u2019s\n domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused. In\n stead, the defendant\u2014who historically may have faced consecutive\n sentences by default\u2014has been granted by some modern legislatures\n statutory protections meant to temper the harshness of the historical\n practice. Ice\u2019s argument that he is \u201centitled\u201d to concurrent sentences\n absent the factfindings Oregon law requires is rejected. Because the\n scope of the federal constitutional jury right must be informed by the\n jury\u2019s historical common-law role, that right does not attach to every\n contemporary state-law \u201centitlement\u201d to predicate findings.

In holding that the facts permitting imposition of an\n  elevated \u201cupper term\u201d sentence for a particular crime fell within the\n  jury\u2019s province rather than the sentencing judge\u2019s, 549 U. S., at 274,\n  Cunningham had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry\n  when no erosion of the jury\u2019s traditional role was at stake. Pp. 7\u20138.\n     (c) States\u2019 interest in the development of their penal systems, and\n  their historic dominion in this area, also counsel against the exten\n  sion of Apprendi that Ice requests. This Court should not diminish\n  the States\u2019 sovereign authority over the administration of their\n  criminal justice systems absent impelling reason to do so. Limiting\n  judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences serves the \u201csalu\n  tary objectives\u201d of promoting sentences proportionate to \u201cthe gravity\n  of the offense,\u201d Blakely, 542 U. S., at 308, and of reducing disparities\n  in sentence length. All agree that a scheme making consecutive sen\n  tences the rule, and concurrent sentences the exception, encounters\n  no Sixth Amendment shoal. To hem in States by holding that they\n  may not choose to make concurrent sentences the rule, and consecu\n  tive sentences the exception, would make scant sense. Neither Ap\n  prendi nor the Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment traditions compel strait\n  jacketing the States in that manner. Further, the potential intrusion\n  of Apprendi\u2019s rule into other state initiatives on sentencing choices or\n  accoutrements\u2014for example, permitting trial judges to find facts\n  about the offense\u2019s nature or the defendant\u2019s character in determin\n  ing the length of supervised release, required attendance at drug re\n  habilitation programs or terms of community service, and the imposi\n  tion of fines and restitution\u2014would cut the rule loose from its\n  moorings. Moreover, the expansion Ice seeks would be difficult for\n  States to administer, as the predicate facts for consecutive sentences\n  could substantially prejudice the defense at the trial\u2019s guilt phase,\n  potentially necessitating bifurcated or trifurcated trials.

New\nJersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and Blakely v. Washington,\n542 U. S. 296 (2004). Those decisions are rooted in the\nhistoric jury function\u2014determining whether the prosecu\ntion has proved each element of an offense beyond a rea\nsonable doubt. They hold that it is within the jury\u2019s prov\nince to determine any fact (other than the existence of a\nprior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment\nauthorized for a particular offense. Thus far, the Court\nhas not extended the Apprendi and Blakely line of deci\nsions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the\nhistoric grounding for the decisions. The question here\npresented concerns a sentencing function in which the jury\ntraditionally played no part: When a defendant has been\ntried and convicted of multiple offenses, each involving\ndiscrete sentencing prescriptions, does the Sixth Amend\nment mandate jury determination of any fact declared\nnecessary to the imposition of consecutive, in lieu of con\ncurrent, sentences?\n   Most States continue the common-law tradition: They\n2                         OREGON v. ICE\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nentrust to judges\u2019 unfettered discretion the decision\nwhether sentences for discrete offenses shall be served\nconsecutively or concurrently. In some States, sentences\nfor multiple offenses are presumed to run consecutively,\nbut sentencing judges may order concurrent sentences\nupon finding cause therefor. Other States, including\nOregon, constrain judges\u2019 discretion by requiring them to\nfind certain facts before imposing consecutive, rather than\nconcurrent, sentences. It is undisputed that States may\nproceed on the first two tracks without transgressing the\nSixth Amendment. The sole issue in dispute, then, is\nwhether the Sixth Amendment, as construed in Apprendi\nand Blakely, precludes the mode of proceeding chosen by\nOregon and several of her sister States. We hold, in light\nof historical practice and the authority of States over\nadministration of their criminal justice systems, that the\nSixth Amendment does not exclude Oregon\u2019s choice.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   State laws, as just observed, prescribe a variety of ap\nproaches to the decision whether a defendant\u2019s sentences\nfor distinct offenses shall run concurrently or consecu\ntively. Oregon might have followed the prevailing pattern\nby placing the decision within the trial court\u2019s discretion\nin all,1 or almost all,2 circumstances. Instead, Oregon and\nseveral other States have adopted a more restrained ap\nproach: they provide for judicial discretion, but constrain\nits exercise.

Ibid.\n   At sentencing, the judge made findings, pursuant to\n\u00a7137.123, that permitted the imposition of consecutive\nsentences. First, the judge found that the two burglaries\nconstituted \u201cseparate incident[s].\u201d Id., at 255, 170 P. 3d,\nat 1053 (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on that\nfinding, the judge had, and exercised, discretion to impose\nthe two burglary sentences consecutively. Ibid.; see\n\u00a7137.123(2).\n   Second, the court found that each offense of touching the\nvictim\u2019s vagina met the statutory criteria set forth in\n\u00a7137.123(5): Ice displayed a \u201cwillingness to commit more\nthan one . . . offense\u201d during each criminal episode, and his\nconduct \u201ccaused or created a risk of causing greater,\nqualitatively different loss, injury, or harm to the victim.\u201d\nId., at 253, 170 P. 3d, at 1051 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). These findings gave the judge discretion to\nimpose the sentence for each of those sexual assault of\nfenses consecutive to the associated burglary sentence.\nThe court elected to do so. Ibid. The court ordered, how\never, that the sentences for touching the victim\u2019s breasts\nrun concurrently with the other sentences. Ibid. In total,\nthe court sentenced Ice to 340 months\u2019 imprisonment.\nApp. 46\u201387.5\n   Ice appealed his sentences. In relevant part, he argued\nthat he had a Sixth Amendment right to have the jury, not\nthe sentencing judge, find the facts that permitted the\nimposition of consecutive sentences.

Most recently, in Cunningham v. California, 549\nU. S. 270 (2007), we applied Apprendi\u2019s rule to facts per\nmitting imposition of an \u201cupper term\u201d sentence under\nCalifornia\u2019s determinate sentencing law. All of these\ndecisions involved sentencing for a discrete crime, not\u2014as\nhere\u2014for multiple offenses different in character or com\nmitted at different times.\n   Our application of Apprendi\u2019s rule must honor the \u201clong\nstanding common-law practice\u201d in which the rule is rooted.\nCunningham, 549 U. S., at 281. The rule\u2019s animating\nprinciple is the preservation of the jury\u2019s historic role as a\nbulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for\nan alleged offense. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477.\nGuided by that principle, our opinions make clear that the\nSixth Amendment does not countenance legislative en\ncroachment on the jury\u2019s traditional domain. See id., at\n497. We accordingly considered whether the finding of a\nparticular fact was understood as within \u201cthe domain of\nthe jury . . . by those who framed the Bill of Rights.\u201d\nHarris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 557 (2002) (plural\nity opinion). In undertaking this inquiry, we remain\ncognizant that administration of a discrete criminal justice\nsystem is among the basic sovereign prerogatives States\nretain. See, e.g., Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 201\n(1977).\n   These twin considerations\u2014historical practice and\nrespect for state sovereignty\u2014counsel against extending\nApprendi\u2019s rule to the imposition of sentences for discrete\ncrimes. The decision to impose sentences consecutively is\nnot within the jury function that \u201cextends down centuries\ninto the common law.\u201d Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477. In\nstead, specification of the regime for administering multi\nple sentences has long been considered the prerogative of\nstate legislatures.\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

Rather, the choice rested exclusively with\nthe judge. See, e.g., 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7636, pp.\n649\u2013650 (2d ed. 1858) (\u201c[W]hen there are two or more\nconvictions, on which sentence remains to be pronounced;\nthe judgment may direct, that each succeeding period of\nimprisonment shall commence on the termination of the\nperiod next preceding.\u201d); A. Campbell, Law of Sentencing\n\u00a79:22, p. 425 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cFirmly rooted in common law\nis the principle that the selection of either concurrent or\nconsecutive sentences rests within the discretion of sen\ntencing judges.\u201d). This was so in England before the\nfounding of our Nation,8 and in the early American\nStates.9 Ice \u201chas no quarrel with [this account] of consecu\ntive sentencing practices through the ages.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 32. The historical record further indicates\nthat a judge\u2019s imposition of consecutive, rather than con\ncurrent, sentences was the prevailing practice.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 E.g.,  King v. Wilkes, 19 How. St. Tr. 1075, 1132\u20131136 (K. B. 1769);\nsee also Lee v. Walker, [1985] 1 Q.

ICE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   In light of this history, legislative reforms regarding the\nimposition of multiple sentences do not implicate the core\nconcerns that prompted our decision in Apprendi. There is\nno encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically\nfound by the jury, nor any threat to the jury\u2019s domain as a\nbulwark at trial between the State and the accused.\nInstead, the defendant\u2014who historically may have faced\nconsecutive sentences by default\u2014has been granted by\nsome modern legislatures statutory protections meant to\ntemper the harshness of the historical practice.\n   It is no answer that, as Ice argues, \u201che was \u2018entitled\u2019 to\u201d\nconcurrent sentences absent the fact findings Oregon law\nrequires. Brief for Respondent 43. In Ice\u2019s view, because\n\u201cthe Oregon Legislature deviated from tradition\u201d and\nenacted a statute that hinges consecutive sentences on\nfact findings, Apprendi\u2019s rule must be imported. Brief for\nRespondent 33. As we have described, the scope of the\nconstitutional jury right must be informed by the histori\ncal role of the jury at common law. See, e.g., Williams v.\nFlorida, 399 U. S. 78, 98\u2013100 (1970). It is therefore not\nthe case that, as Ice suggests, the federal constitutional\nright attaches to every contemporary state-law \u201centitle\nment\u201d to predicate findings.\n   For similar reasons, Cunningham, upon which Ice heav\nily relies, does not control his case. As stated earlier, we\nheld in Cunningham that the facts permitting imposition\nof an elevated \u201cupper term\u201d sentence for a particular crime\nfell within the jury\u2019s province. 549 U. S., at 274 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The assignment of such a\nfinding to the sentencing judge implicates Apprendi\u2019s core\nconcern: a legislative attempt to \u201cremove from the [prov\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npunishment due to the additional offence, merely because he is already\nsentenced to be imprisoned for another offence.\u201d); ibid.

Apprendi, 530\nU. S., at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted). We had\nno occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no\nerosion of the jury\u2019s traditional role was at stake. Cun\nningham thus does not impede our conclusion that, as\nApprendi\u2019s core concern is inapplicable to the issue at\nhand, so too is the Sixth Amendment\u2019s restriction on\njudge-found facts.\n                              B\n   States\u2019 interest in the development of their penal sys\ntems, and their historic dominion in this area, also counsel\nagainst the extension of Apprendi that Ice requests. Be\nyond question, the authority of States over the admini\nstration of their criminal justice systems lies at the core of\ntheir sovereign status. See, e.g., Patterson, 432 U. S., at\n201 (\u201cIt goes without saying that preventing and dealing\nwith crime is much more the business of the States than it\nis of the Federal Government.\u201d). We have long recognized\nthe role of the States as laboratories for devising solutions\nto difficult legal problems. See New State Ice Co. v. Lieb\nmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).\nThis Court should not diminish that role absent impelling\nreason to do so.\n   It bears emphasis that state legislative innovations like\nOregon\u2019s seek to rein in the discretion judges possessed at\ncommon law to impose consecutive sentences at will.\nLimiting judicial discretion to impose consecutive sen\ntences serves the \u201csalutary objectives\u201d of promoting sen\ntences proportionate to \u201cthe gravity of the offense,\u201d\nBlakely, 542 U. S., at 308, and of reducing disparities in\nsentence length, see 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O.\nKerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a726.3(f) (3d ed 2007). All agree\nthat a scheme making consecutive sentences the rule, and\nconcurrent sentences the exception, encounters no Sixth\n10                    OREGON v. ICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAmendment shoal. To hem in States by holding that they\nmay not equally choose to make concurrent sentences\nthe rule, and consecutive sentences the exception, would\nmake scant sense. Neither Apprendi nor our Sixth\nAmendment traditions compel straitjacketing the States\nin that manner.\n   Further, it is unclear how many other state initiatives\nwould fall under Ice\u2019s proposed expansion of Apprendi. As\n17 States have observed in an amici brief supporting\nOregon, States currently permit judges to make a variety\nof sentencing determinations other than the length of\nincarceration. Trial judges often find facts about the\nnature of the offense or the character of the defendant in\ndetermining, for example, the length of supervised release\nfollowing service of a prison sentence; required attendance\nat drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community\nservice; and the imposition of statutorily prescribed fines\nand orders of restitution. See Brief for State of Indiana\net al. as Amici Curiae 11. Intruding Apprendi\u2019s rule into\nthese decisions on sentencing choices or accoutrements\nsurely would cut the rule loose from its moorings.\n   Moreover, the expansion that Ice seeks would be diffi\ncult for States to administer. The predicate facts for\nconsecutive sentences could substantially prejudice the\ndefense at the guilt phase of a trial. As a result, bifur\ncated or trifurcated trials might often prove necessary.\nBrief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 14\u201315.\nWe will not so burden the Nation\u2019s trial courts absent any\ngenuine affront to Apprendi\u2019s instruction.\n   We recognize that not every state initiative will be in\nharmony with Sixth Amendment ideals. But as we have\npreviously emphasized, \u201cstructural democratic constraints\nexist to discourage legislatures from\u201d pernicious manipu\nlation of the rules we articulate. Apprendi, 530 U.

New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466\n(2000), is clear: Any fact\u2014other than that of a prior con\nviction\u2014that increases the maximum punishment to\nwhich a defendant may be sentenced must be admitted by\nthe defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a\njury. Oregon\u2019s sentencing scheme allows judges rather\nthan juries to find the facts necessary to commit defen\ndants to longer prison sentences, and thus directly contra\ndicts what we held eight years ago and have reaffirmed\nseveral times since. The Court\u2019s justification of Oregon\u2019s\nscheme is a virtual copy of the dissents in those cases.\n   The judge in this case could not have imposed a sen\ntence of consecutive prison terms without making the\nfactual finding that the defendant caused \u201cseparate\nharms\u201d to the victim by the acts that produced two convic\ntions. See 343 Ore. 248, 268, 170 P. 3d 1049, 1060 (2007)\n(Kistler, J., dissenting). There can thus be no doubt that\nthe judge\u2019s factual finding was \u201cessential to\u201d the punish\nment he imposed. United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220,\n232 (2005). That \u201cshould be the end of the matter.\u201d\nBlakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 313 (2004).\n   Instead, the Court attempts to distinguish Oregon\u2019s\nsentencing scheme by reasoning that the rule of Apprendi\napplies only to the length of a sentence for an individual\n2                      OREGON v. ICE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncrime and not to the total sentence for a defendant. I\ncannot understand why we would make such a strange\nexception to the treasured right of trial by jury. Neither\nthe reasoning of the Apprendi line of cases, nor any dis\ntinctive history of the factfinding necessary to imposition\nof consecutive sentences, nor (of course) logic supports\nsuch an odd rule.\n   We have taken pains to reject artificial limitations upon\nthe facts subject to the jury-trial guarantee. We long ago\nmade clear that the guarantee turns upon the penal con\nsequences attached to the fact, and not to its formal defini\ntion as an element of the crime. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421\nU. S. 684, 698 (1975). More recently, we rejected the\ncontention that the \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d that\nqualify a defendant for the death penalty did not have to\nbe found by the jury. \u201cIf,\u201d we said, \u201ca State makes an\nincrease in a defendant\u2019s authorized punishment contin\ngent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u2014no matter how the\nState labels it\u2014must be found by a jury beyond a reason\nable doubt.\u201d Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 602 (2002). A\nbare three years ago, in rejecting the contention that the\nfacts determining application of the Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines did not have to be found by the jury, we again\nset forth the pragmatic, practical, nonformalistic rule in\nterms that cannot be mistaken: The jury must \u201cfind the\nexistence of \u2018 \u201cany particular fact\u201d \u2019 that the law makes\nessential to [a defendant\u2019s] punishment.\u201d Booker, supra,\nat 232 (quoting Blakely, supra, at 301).\n   This rule leaves no room for a formalistic distinction\nbetween facts bearing on the number of years of impris\nonment that a defendant will serve for one count (subject\nto the rule of Apprendi) and facts bearing on how many\nyears will be served in total (now not subject to Apprendi).\nThere is no doubt that consecutive sentences are a\n\u201cgreater punishment\u201d than concurrent sentences, Ap\u00ad\nprendi, supra, at 494. We have hitherto taken note of the\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nreality that \u201ca concurrent sentence is traditionally im\nposed as a less severe sanction than a consecutive sen\ntence.\u201d Ralston v. Robinson, 454 U. S. 201, 216, n. 9\n(1981) (emphasis deleted). The decision to impose con\nsecutive sentences alters the single consequence most\nimportant to convicted noncapital defendants: their date of\nrelease from prison. For many defendants, the difference\nbetween consecutive and concurrent sentences is more\nimportant than a jury verdict of innocence on any single\ncount: Two consecutive 10-year sentences are in most\ncircumstances a more severe punishment than any num\nber of concurrent 10-year sentences.\n   To support its distinction-without-a-difference, the Court\nputs forward the same (the very same) arguments regard\ning the history of sentencing that were rejected by Ap\u00ad\nprendi. Here, it is entirely irrelevant that common-law\njudges had discretion to impose either consecutive or\nconcurrent sentences, ante, at 7; just as there it was en\ntirely irrelevant that common-law judges had discretion to\nimpose greater or lesser sentences (within the prescribed\nstatutory maximum) for individual convictions. There is\nno Sixth Amendment problem with a system that exposes\ndefendants to a known range of sentences after a guilty\nverdict: \u201cIn a system that says the judge may punish\nburglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is\nrisking 40 years in jail.\u201d Blakely, supra, at 309. The same\nanalysis applies to a system where both consecutive and\nconcurrent sentences are authorized after only a jury\nverdict of guilt; the burglar-rapist knows he is risking\nconsecutive sentences. Our concern here is precisely the\nsame as our concern in Apprendi: What happens when a\nState breaks from the common-law practice of discretion\nary sentences and permits the imposition of an elevated\nsentence only upon the showing of extraordinary facts? In\nsuch a system, the defendant \u201cis entitled to\u201d the lighter\nsentence \u201cand by reason of the Sixth Amendment[,] the\n4                      OREGON v. ICE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfacts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a\njury.\u201d Blakely, 542 U. S., at 309.\n   The Court protests that in this case there is no \u201cen\ncroachment\u201d on or \u201cerosion\u201d of the jury\u2019s role because\ntraditionally it was for the judge to determine whether\nthere would be concurrent terms. Ante, at 8\u20139. Alas, this\nargument too was made and rejected in Apprendi. The\njury\u2019s role was not diminished, the Apprendi dissent con\ntended, because it was traditionally up to judges, not\njuries, to determine what the sentence would be. 530\nU. S., at 556, 559 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The Court\u2019s\nopinion acknowledged that in the 19th century it was the\npractice to leave sentencing up to the judges, within limits\nfixed by law. But, it said, that practice had no bearing\nupon whether the jury must find the fact where a law\nconditions the higher sentence upon the fact. The jury\u2019s\nrole is diminished when the length of a sentence is made\nto depend upon a fact removed from its determination.\nId., at 482\u2013483. The same is true here.\n   The Court then observes that the results of the Oregon\nsystem could readily be achieved, instead, by a system in\nwhich consecutive sentences are the default rule but\njudges are permitted to impose concurrent sentences when\nthey find certain facts. Ante, at 9\u201310. Undoubtedly the\nSixth Amendment permits a system in which judges are\nauthorized (or even required) to impose consecutive sen\ntences unless the defendant proves additional facts to the\nCourt\u2019s satisfaction. See ibid. But the permissibility of\nthat alternative means of achieving the same end obvi\nously does not distinguish Apprendi, because the same\nargument (the very same argument) was raised and\nsquarely rejected in that case:\n    \u201cIf the defendant can escape the statutory maximum\n    by showing, for example, that he is a war veteran,\n    then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n    neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of lib\n    erty greater than that authorized by the verdict ac\n    cording to statute, nor is the judge imposing upon the\n    defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying\n    the jury verdict alone. Core concerns animating the\n    jury and burden-of-proof requirements are thus ab\n    sent from such a scheme.\u201d 530 U. S., at 491, n. 16.\n   Ultimately, the Court abandons its effort to provide\nanalytic support for its decision, and turns to what it\nthinks to be the \u201c \u2018salutary objectives\u2019 \u201d of Oregon\u2019s scheme.\nAnte, at 9. \u201cLimiting judicial discretion,\u201d we are told,\npromotes sentences proportionate to the gravity of the\noffense, and reduces disparities in sentence length. Ibid.\nThe same argument (the very same argument) was made\nand rejected in Booker, see 543 U. S., at 244, and Blakely,\nsee 542 U. S., at 313. The protection of the Sixth Amend\nment does not turn on this Court\u2019s opinion of whether an\nalternative scheme is good policy, or whether the legisla\nture had a compassionate heart in adopting it. The right\nto trial by jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a\ngiven, and all legislative policymaking\u2014good and bad,\nheartless and compassionate\u2014must work within the\nconfines of that reality. Of course the Court probably\nexaggerates the benign effect of Oregon\u2019s scheme, as is\nsuggested by the defense bar\u2019s vigorous objection, evi\ndenced by the participation of the National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as amicus in favor of respon\ndent. Even that exaggeration is a replay of the rejected\ndissent in one of our prior cases. There the Court re\nsponded: \u201cIt is hard to believe that the National Associa\ntion of Criminal Defense Lawyers was somehow duped\ninto arguing for the wrong side.\u201d Blakely, supra, at 312.\n   Finally, the Court summons up the parade of horribles\nassembled by the amicus brief of 17 States supporting\nOregon. It notes that \u201c[t]rial judges often find facts\u201d in\n6                      OREGON v. ICE\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconnection with \u201ca variety of sentencing determinations\nother than the length of incarceration,\u201d and worries that\neven their ability to set the length of supervised release,\nimpose community service, or order entry into a drug\nrehabilitation program, may be called into question. Ante,\nat 10. But if these courses reduce rather than augment\nthe punishment that the jury verdict imposes, there is no\nproblem. The last horrible the Court invokes is the pros\npect of bifurcated or even trifurcated trials in order to\nhave the jury find the facts essential to consecutive sen\ntencing without prejudicing the defendant\u2019s merits case.\nIbid. That is another d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9; we have\nwatched it parade past before, in several of our Apprendi\nrelated opinions, and have not saluted. See Blakely, su\u00ad\npra, at 336\u2013337 (BREYER, J., dissenting); Apprendi, supra,\nat 557 (same).\n                        *     *     *\n  The Court\u2019s peroration says that \u201c[t]he jury-trial right is\nbest honored through a \u2018principled rationale\u2019 that applies\nthe rule of the Apprendi cases \u2018within the central sphere of\ntheir concern.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11 (quoting Cunningham v.\nCalifornia, 549 U. S. 270, 295 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., dis\nsenting)). Undoubtedly so. But we have hitherto consid\nered \u201cthe central sphere of their concern\u201d to be facts neces\nsary to the increase of the defendant\u2019s sentence beyond\nwhat the jury verdict alone justifies. \u201cIf the jury\u2019s verdict\nalone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the\njudge must find an additional fact to impose the longer\nterm, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.\u201d\nId., at 290 (opinion of the Court). If the doubling or tri\npling of a defendant\u2019s jail time through fact-dependent\nconsecutive sentencing does not meet this description,\nnothing does. And as for a \u201cprincipled rationale\u201d: The\nCourt\u2019s reliance upon a distinction without a difference,\nand its repeated exhumation of arguments dead and bur\n                 Cite as: 555 U.

New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <i>Blakely v.

Those decisions are rooted in the historic jury function\u0097determining whether the prosecution has proved each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. They hold that it is within the jury's province to determine any fact (other than the existence of a prior conviction) that increases the maximum punishment authorized for a particular offense. Thus far, the Court has not extended the <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely</i> line of decisions beyond the offense-specific context that supplied the historic grounding for the decisions. The question here presented concerns a sentencing function in which the jury traditionally played no part: When a defendant has been tried and convicted of multiple offenses, each involving discrete sentencing prescriptions, does the Sixth Amendment mandate jury determination of any fact declared necessary to the imposition of consecutive, in lieu of concurrent, sentences?</p>\n<p>Most States continue the common-law tradition: They entrust to judges' unfettered discretion the decision whether sentences for discrete offenses shall be served consecutively or concurrently. In some States, sentences for multiple offenses are presumed to run consecutively, but sentencing judges may order concurrent sentences upon finding cause therefor. Other States, including Oregon, constrain judges' discretion by requiring them to find certain facts before imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences. It is undisputed that States may proceed on the first two tracks without transgressing the Sixth Amendment. The sole issue in dispute, then, is whether the Sixth Amendment, as construed in <i>Apprendi</i> and <i>Blakely,</i> precludes the mode of proceeding chosen by Oregon and several of her sister States. We hold, in light of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*715</span> historical practice and the authority of States over administration of their criminal justice systems, that the Sixth Amendment does not exclude Oregon's choice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>State laws, as just observed, prescribe a variety of approaches to the decision whether a defendant's sentences for distinct offenses shall run concurrently or consecutively. Oregon might have followed the prevailing pattern by placing the decision within the trial court's discretion in all,<sup>[1]</sup> or almost all,<sup>[2]</sup> circumstances. Instead, Oregon and several other States have adopted a more restrained approach: they provide for judicial discretion, but constrain its exercise. In these States, to impose consecutive sentences, judges must make certain predicate fact findings.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The controlling statute in Oregon provides that sentences shall run concurrently unless the judge finds statutorily described facts. Ore.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 137.123(1) (2007). In most cases, finding such facts permits\u0097 but does not require\u0097the judge to order consecutive sentences.<sup>[4]</sup> Specifically, an Oregon judge may order consecutive sentences \"[i]f a defendant is simultaneously sentenced for criminal offenses that do not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\" \u00a7 137.123(2). If the offenses <i>do</i> arise from the same course of conduct, the judge may still impose consecutive sentences if she finds either:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(a) That the criminal offense ... was an indication of defendant's willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"(b) The criminal offense ... caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or ... to a different victim....\" \u00a7 137.123(5).</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>On two occasions between December 1996 and July 1997, respondent Thomas Eugene Ice entered an apartment in the complex he managed and sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl. 343 Ore. 248, 250, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835388\"><a href=\"/opinion/835388/state-v-ice/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span>, 1050 (2007). An Oregon jury convicted Ice of six crimes. For each of the two incidents, the jury found him guilty of first-degree burglary for entering with the intent to commit sexual abuse; first-degree sexual assault for touching the victim's vagina; and first-degree sexual assault for touching the victim's breasts. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>At sentencing, the judge made findings, pursuant to \u00a7 137.123, that permitted the imposition of consecutive sentences. First, the judge found that the two burglaries constituted \"separate incident[s].\" <i>Id.,</i> at 255, 170 P.3d, at 1053 (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on that finding, the judge had, and exercised, discretion to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*716</span> impose the two burglary sentences consecutively. <i>Ibid.;</i> see \u00a7 137.123(2).</p>\n<p>Second, the court found that each offense of touching the victim's vagina met the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7 137.123(5): Ice displayed a \"willingness to commit more than one ... offense\" during each criminal episode, and his conduct \"caused or created a risk of causing greater, qualitatively different loss, injury, or harm to the victim.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 253, 170 P.3d, at 1051 (internal quotation marks omitted). These findings gave the judge discretion to impose the sentence for each of those sexual assault offenses consecutive to the associated burglary sentence. The court elected to do so. <i>Ibid.</i> The court ordered, however, that the sentences for touching the victim's breasts run concurrently with the other sentences. <i>Ibid.</i> In total, the court sentenced Ice to 340 months' imprisonment. App. 46-87.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Ice appealed his sentences. In relevant part, he argued that he had a Sixth Amendment right to have the jury, not the sentencing judge, find the facts that permitted the imposition of consecutive sentences. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment without opinion. 178 Ore.App. 415, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></span> (2001).</p>\n<p>The Oregon Supreme Court granted Ice's petition for review and reversed, 4 to 2. 343 Ore., at 250, 170 P.3d, at 1050.<sup>[6]</sup> In the majority's view, the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> applied, because the imposition of consecutive sentences increased \"the quantum of punishment\" imposed. 343 Ore., at 265, 170 P.3d, at 1058. The dissenting justices concluded that \"[n]either the holding in <i>Apprendi</i> nor its reasoning support[ed] extending that decision to the question of consecutive sentencing.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835388\"><a href=\"/opinion/835388/state-v-ice/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span>, 170 P.3d, at 1059 (opinion of Kistler, J.). State high courts have divided over whether the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> governs consecutive sentencing decisions.<sup>[7]</sup> We granted review to resolve the question. 552 U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1657, 170 L.Ed.2d 353 (2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>The Federal Constitution's jury-trial guarantee assigns the determination of certain facts to the jury's exclusive province. Under that guarantee, this Court held in <i>Apprendi,</i> \"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p>We have applied <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty, <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span>, 602, 609, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), facts allowing a sentence exceeding the \"standard\" range in Washington's sentencing system, <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 304-305, 124 S.Ct. 2531, and facts prompting an elevated sentence under then-mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, <i>United States v.

Most <span class=\"star-pagination\">*717</span> recently, in <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145761\"><a href=\"/opinion/145761/cunningham-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), we applied <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule to facts permitting imposition of an \"upper term\" sentence under California's determinate sentencing law. All of these decisions involved sentencing for a discrete crime, not\u0097as here\u0097for multiple offenses different in character or committed at different times.</p>\n<p>Our application of <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule must honor the \"longstanding common-law practice\" in which the rule is rooted. <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at 281, 127 S.Ct. 856. The rule's animating principle is the preservation of the jury's historic role as a bulwark between the State and the accused at the trial for an alleged offense. See <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 477, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Guided by that principle, our opinions make clear that the Sixth Amendment does not countenance legislative encroachment on the jury's traditional domain. See <i>id.,</i> at 497, 120 S.Ct. 2348. We accordingly considered whether the finding of a particular fact was understood as within \"the domain of the jury ... by those who framed the Bill of Rights.\" <i>Harris v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121164\"><a href=\"/opinion/121164/harris-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 557, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (plurality opinion). In undertaking this inquiry, we remain cognizant that administration of a discrete criminal justice system is among the basic sovereign prerogatives States retain. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Patterson v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109698\"><a href=\"/opinion/109698/patterson-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 201, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977).</p>\n<p>These twin considerations\u0097historical practice and respect for state sovereignty\u0097counsel against extending <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule to the imposition of sentences for discrete crimes. The decision to impose sentences consecutively is not within the jury function that \"extends down centuries into the common law.\" <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 477, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Instead, specification of the regime for administering multiple sentences has long been considered the prerogative of state legislatures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The historical record demonstrates that the jury played no role in the decision to impose sentences consecutively or concurrently. Rather, the choice rested exclusively with the judge. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7 636, pp. 649-650 (2d ed.1858) (\"[W]hen there are two or more convictions, on which sentence remains to be pronounced; the judgment may direct, that each succeeding period of imprisonment shall commence on the termination of the period next preceding.\"); A. Campbell, Law of Sentencing \u00a7 9:22, p. 425 (3d ed.2004) (\"Firmly rooted in common law is the principle that the selection of either concurrent or consecutive sentences rests within the discretion of sentencing judges.\"). This was so in England before the founding of our Nation,<sup>[8]</sup> and in the early American States.<sup>[9]</sup> Ice \"has no quarrel <span class=\"star-pagination\">*718</span> with [this account] of consecutive sentencing practices through the ages.\" Brief for Respondent 32. The historical record further indicates that a judge's imposition of consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences was the prevailing practice.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>In light of this history, legislative reforms regarding the imposition of multiple sentences do not implicate the core concerns that prompted our decision in <i>Apprendi.</i> There is no encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jury's domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused. Instead, the defendant\u0097who historically may have faced consecutive sentences by default\u0097has been granted by some modern legislatures statutory protections meant to temper the harshness of the historical practice.</p>\n<p>It is no answer that, as Ice argues, \"he was <i>`entitled'</i> to\" concurrent sentences absent the fact findings Oregon law requires. Brief for Respondent 43. In Ice's view, because \"the Oregon Legislature deviated from tradition\" and enacted a statute that hinges consecutive sentences on fact findings, <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule must be imported. Brief for Respondent 33. As we have described, the scope of the constitutional jury right must be informed by the historical role of the jury at common law. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Williams v. Florida,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108186\"><a href=\"/opinion/108186/williams-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 98-100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970). It is therefore not the case that, as Ice suggests, the federal constitutional right attaches to every contemporary state-law \"entitlement\" to predicate findings.</p>\n<p>For similar reasons, <i>Cunningham,</i> upon which Ice heavily relies, does not control his case. As stated earlier, we held in <i>Cunningham</i> that the facts permitting imposition of an elevated \"upper term\" sentence for a particular crime fell within the jury's province. 549 U.S., at 274, 127 S.Ct. 856 (internal quotation marks omitted). The assignment of such a finding to the sentencing judge implicates <i>Apprendi</i>'s core concern: a legislative attempt to \"remove from the [province of the] jury\" the determination of facts that warrant punishment for a specific statutory offense. <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (internal quotation marks omitted). We had no occasion to consider the appropriate inquiry when no erosion of the jury's traditional role was at stake. <i>Cunningham</i> thus does not impede our conclusion that, as <i>Apprendi</i>'s core concern is inapplicable to the issue at hand, so too is the Sixth Amendment's restriction on judge-found facts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>States' interest in the development of their penal systems, and their historic dominion in this area, also counsel against the extension of <i>Apprendi</i> that Ice requests. Beyond question, the authority of States over the administration of their criminal justice systems lies at the core of their sovereign status. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Patterson,</i> 432 U.S., at 201, 97 S.Ct. 2319 (\"It goes without saying that preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government.\"). We have long recognized the role of the States as laboratories for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*719</span> devising solutions to difficult legal problems. See <i>New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101887\"><a href=\"/opinion/101887/new-state-ice-co-v-liebmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 311, 52 S.Ct. 371, 76 L.Ed. 747 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). This Court should not diminish that role absent impelling reason to do so.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasis that state legislative innovations like Oregon's seek to rein in the discretion judges possessed at common law to impose consecutive sentences at will. Limiting judicial discretion to impose consecutive sentences serves the \"salutary objectives\" of promoting sentences proportionate to \"the gravity of the offense,\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 308, 124 S.Ct. 2531, and of reducing disparities in sentence length, see 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 26.3(f) (3d ed.2007). All agree that a scheme making consecutive sentences the rule, and concurrent sentences the exception, encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal. To hem in States by holding that they may not equally choose to make concurrent sentences the rule, and consecutive sentences the exception, would make scant sense. Neither <i>Apprendi</i> nor our Sixth Amendment traditions compel straitjacketing the States in that manner.</p>\n<p>Further, it is unclear how many other state initiatives would fall under Ice's proposed expansion of <i>Apprendi.</i> As 17 States have observed in an <i>amici</i> brief supporting Oregon, States currently permit judges to make a variety of sentencing determinations other than the length of incarceration. Trial judges often find facts about the nature of the offense or the character of the defendant in determining, for example, the length of supervised release following service of a prison sentence; required attendance at drug rehabilitation programs or terms of community service; and the imposition of statutorily prescribed fines and orders of restitution. See Brief for State of Indiana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11. Intruding <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule into these decisions on sentencing choices or accoutrements surely would cut the rule loose from its moorings.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the expansion that Ice seeks would be difficult for States to administer. The predicate facts for consecutive sentences could substantially prejudice the defense at the guilt phase of a trial. As a result, bifurcated or trifurcated trials might often prove necessary. Brief for State of Indiana et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 14-15. We will not so burden the Nation's trial courts absent any genuine affront to <i>Apprendi</i>'s instruction.</p>\n<p>We recognize that not every state initiative will be in harmony with Sixth Amendment ideals. But as we have previously emphasized, \"structural democratic constraints exist to discourage legislatures from\" pernicious manipulation of the rules we articulate. <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S., at 490, n. 16, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In any event, if confronted with such a manipulation, \"we would be required to question whether the [legislative measure] was constitutional under this Court's prior decisions.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 491, n. 16, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The Oregon statute before us today raises no such concern.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Members of this Court have warned against \"wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the <i>Apprendi</i> doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries.\" <i>Cunningham,</i> 549 U.S., at 295, 127 S.Ct. 856 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). The jury-trial right is best honored through a \"principled rationale\" that applies the rule of the <i>Apprendi</i> cases \"within the central sphere of their concern.\" 549 U.S., at 295, 127 S.Ct. 856. Our disposition today\u0097upholding an Oregon statute that assigns to judges a decision that has not traditionally belonged to the jury\u0097is faithful to that aim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*720</span> * * *</h2>\n<p>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice SOUTER, and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The rule of <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is clear: Any fact\u0097other than that of a prior conviction\u0097that increases the maximum punishment to which a defendant may be sentenced must be admitted by the defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. Oregon's sentencing scheme allows judges rather than juries to find the facts necessary to commit defendants to longer prison sentences, and thus directly contradicts what we held eight years ago and have reaffirmed several times since. The Court's justification of Oregon's scheme is a virtual copy of the dissents in those cases.</p>\n<p>The judge in this case could not have imposed a sentence of consecutive prison terms without making the factual finding that the defendant caused \"separate harms\" to the victim by the acts that produced two convictions. See 343 Ore. 248, 268, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"835388\"><a href=\"/opinion/835388/state-v-ice/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span>, 1060 (2007) (Kistler, J., dissenting). There can thus be no doubt that the judge's factual finding was \"essential to\" the punishment he imposed. <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 232, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). That \"should be the end of the matter.\" <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 313, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p>Instead, the Court attempts to distinguish Oregon's sentencing scheme by reasoning that the rule of <i>Apprendi</i> applies only to the length of a sentence for an individual crime and not to the total sentence for a defendant. I cannot understand why we would make such a strange exception to the treasured right of trial by jury. Neither the reasoning of the <i>Apprendi</i> line of cases, nor any distinctive history of the factfinding necessary to imposition of consecutive sentences, nor (of course) logic supports such an odd rule.</p>\n<p>We have taken pains to reject artificial limitations upon the facts subject to the jury-trial guarantee. We long ago made clear that the guarantee turns upon the penal consequences attached to the fact, and not to its formal definition as an element of the crime. <i>Mullaney v. Wilbur,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109265\"><a href=\"/opinion/109265/mullaney-v-wilbur/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 698, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975). More recently, we rejected the contention that the \"aggravating circumstances\" that qualify a defendant for the death penalty did not have to be found by the jury. \"If,\" we said, \"a State makes an increase in a defendant's authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u0097no matter how the State labels it\u0097must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Ring v. Arizona,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span>, 602, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). A bare three years ago, in rejecting the contention that the facts determining application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines did not have to be found by the jury, we again set forth the pragmatic, practical, nonformalistic rule in terms that cannot be mistaken: The jury must \"find the existence of `\"any particular fact\"' that the law makes essential to [a defendant's] punishment.\" <i>Booker, supra,</i> at 232, 125 S.Ct. 738 (quoting <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 301).</p>\n<p>This rule leaves no room for a formalistic distinction between facts bearing on the number of years of imprisonment that a defendant will serve for one count (subject to the rule of <i>Apprendi</i>) and facts bearing on how many years will be served in total (now not subject to <i>Apprendi</i>). There is <span class=\"star-pagination\">*721</span> no doubt that consecutive sentences are a \"greater punishment\" than concurrent sentences, <i>Apprendi, supra,</i> at 494, 120 S.Ct. 2348 We have hitherto taken note of the reality that \"a concurrent sentence is traditionally imposed as a less severe sanction than a consecutive sentence.\" <i>Ralston v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></span>, 216, n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 233, 70 L.Ed.2d 345 (1981) (emphasis deleted). The decision to impose consecutive sentences alters the single consequence most important to convicted noncapital defendants: their date of release from prison. For many defendants, the difference between consecutive and concurrent sentences is more important than a jury verdict of innocence on any single count: Two consecutive 10-year sentences are in most circumstances a more severe punishment than any number of concurrent 10-year sentences.</p>\n<p>To support its distinction-without-a-difference, the Court puts forward the same (the <i>very</i> same) arguments regarding the history of sentencing that were rejected by <i>Apprendi.</i> Here, it is entirely irrelevant that common-law judges had discretion to impose either consecutive or concurrent sentences, <i>ante,</i> at 717-718; just as there it was entirely irrelevant that common-law judges had discretion to impose greater or lesser sentences (within the prescribed statutory maximum) for individual convictions. There is no Sixth Amendment problem with a system that exposes defendants to a known range of sentences after a guilty verdict: \"In a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail.\" <i>Blakely, supra,</i> at 309, 124 S.Ct. 2531. The same analysis applies to a system where both consecutive and concurrent sentences are authorized after only a jury verdict of guilt; the burglar-rapist knows he is risking consecutive sentences. Our concern here is precisely the same as our concern in <i>Apprendi:</i> What happens when a State breaks from the common-law practice of discretionary sentences and permits the imposition of an elevated sentence only upon the showing of extraordinary facts? In such a system, the defendant \"is <i>entitled</i> to\" the lighter sentence \"and by reason of the Sixth Amendment[,] the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury.\" <i>Blakely,</i> 542 U.S., at 309, 124 S.Ct. 2531.</p>\n<p>The Court protests that in this case there is no \"encroachment\" on or \"erosion\" of the jury's role because traditionally it was for the judge to determine whether there would be concurrent terms. <i>Ante,</i> at 718-719. Alas, this argument too was made and rejected in <i>Apprendi.</i> The jury's role was not diminished, the <i>Apprendi</i> dissent contended, because it was traditionally up to judges, not juries, to determine what the sentence would be. 530 U.S., at 556, 559, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The Court's opinion acknowledged that in the 19th century it was the practice to leave sentencing up to the judges, within limits fixed by law. But, it said, that practice had no bearing upon whether the jury must find the fact where a law conditions the higher sentence upon the fact. The jury's role <i>is</i> diminished when the length of a sentence is made to depend upon a fact removed from its determination. <i>Id.,</i> at 482-483, 120 S.Ct. 2348. The same is true here.</p>\n<p>The Court then observes that the results of the Oregon system could readily be achieved, instead, by a system in which consecutive sentences are the default rule but judges are permitted to impose concurrent sentences when they find certain facts. <i>Ante,</i> at 718-719. Undoubtedly the Sixth Amendment permits a system in which judges are authorized (or even required) to impose consecutive sentences unless the defendant proves additional facts to the Court's satisfaction. See <i>ibid.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*722</span> But the permissibility of that alternative means of achieving the same end obviously does not distinguish <i>Apprendi,</i> because the same argument (the <i>very</i> same argument) was raised and squarely rejected in that case:</p>\n<blockquote>\"If the defendant can escape the statutory maximum by showing, for example, that he is a war veteran, then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorized by the verdict according to statute, nor is the judge imposing upon the defendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone. Core concerns animating the jury and burden-of-proof requirements are thus absent from such a scheme.\" 530 U.S., at 491, n. 16, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, the Court abandons its effort to provide analytic support for its decision, and turns to what it thinks to be the \"`salutary objectives'\" of Oregon's scheme. <i>Ante,</i> at 719. \"Limiting judicial discretion,\" we are told, promotes sentences proportionate to the gravity of the offense, and reduces disparities in sentence length. <i>Ibid.</i> The same argument (the <i>very</i> same argument) was made and rejected in <i>Booker,</i> see 543 U.S., at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, and <i>Blakely,</i> see 542 U.S., at 313, 124 S.Ct. 2531. The protection of the Sixth Amendment does not turn on this Court's opinion of whether an alternative scheme is good policy, or whether the legislature had a compassionate heart in adopting it. The right to trial by jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a given, and <i>all</i> legislative policymaking\u0097good and bad, heartless and compassionate\u0097 must work within the confines of that reality. Of course the Court probably exaggerates the benign effect of Oregon's scheme, as is suggested by the defense bar's vigorous objection, evidenced by the participation of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <i>amicus</i> in favor of respondent. Even that exaggeration is a replay of the rejected dissent in one of our prior cases. There the Court responded: \"It is hard to believe that the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was somehow duped into arguing for the wrong side.\" <i>Blakely,</i> supra, at 312, 124 S.Ct. 2531</p>\n<p>Finally, the Court summons up the parade of horribles assembled by the <i>amicus</i> brief of 17 States supporting Oregon. It notes that \"[t]rial judges often find facts\" in connection with \"a variety of sentencing determinations other than the length of incarceration,\" and worries that even their ability to set the length of supervised release, impose community service, or order entry into a drug rehabilitation program, may be called into question. <i>Ante,</i> at 719. But if these courses reduce rather than augment the punishment that the jury verdict imposes, there is no problem. The last horrible the Court invokes is the prospect of bifurcated or even trifurcated trials in order to have the jury find the facts essential to consecutive sentencing without prejudicing the defendant's merits case. <i>Ibid.</i> That is another <i>d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu</i> and <i>d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9;</i> we have watched it parade past before, in several of our <i>Apprendi</i>-related opinions, and have not saluted. See <i>Blakely, supra,</i> at 336-337, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (BREYER, J., dissenting); <i>Apprendi, supra,</i> at 557, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (same).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The Court's peroration says that \"[t]he jury-trial right is best honored through a `principled rationale' that applies the rule of the <i>Apprendi</i> cases `within the central sphere of their concern.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 719 (quoting <i>Cunningham v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145761\"><a href=\"/opinion/145761/cunningham-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 295, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)). Undoubtedly so. But we have hitherto <span class=\"star-pagination\">*723</span> considered \"the central sphere of their concern\" to be facts necessary to the increase of the defendant's sentence beyond what the jury verdict alone justifies. \"If the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 290, 127 S.Ct. 856 (opinion of the Court). If the doubling or tripling of a defendant's jail time through fact-dependent consecutive sentencing does not meet this description, nothing does. And as for a \"principled rationale\": The Court's reliance upon a distinction without a difference, and its repeated exhumation of arguments dead and buried by prior cases, seems to me the epitome of the opposite. Today's opinion muddies the waters, and gives cause to doubt whether the Court is willing to stand by <i>Apprendi</i>'s interpretation of the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  <i>E.g.,</i> Connecticut (Conn.
