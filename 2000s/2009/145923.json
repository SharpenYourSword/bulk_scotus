UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 06\u201311206.       Argued November 10, 2008\u2014Decided January 13, 2009\nThe Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) imposes a 15-year mandatory\n  prison term on a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm who has\n  three prior convictions for committing certain drug crimes or \u201ca vio\n  lent felony,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1), defined as a crime punishable by\n  more than one year\u2019s imprisonment that, inter alia, \u201cinvolves conduct\n  that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d\n  \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). At petitioner Chambers\u2019 sentencing for being a felon\n  in possession of a firearm, the Government sought ACCA\u2019s 15-year\n  mandatory prison term. Chambers disputed one of his prior convic\n  tions\u2014failing to report for weekend confinement\u2014as falling outside\n  the ACCA definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d The District Court treated\n  the failure to report as a form of what the relevant state statute calls\n  \u201cescape from [a] penal institution,\u201d and held that it qualified as a\n  \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA. The Seventh Circuit agreed.\nHeld: Illinois\u2019 crime of failure to report for penal confinement falls out\n side the scope of ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. Pp. 3\u20138.\n    (a) For purposes of ACCA\u2019s definitions, it is the generic crime that\n counts, not how the crime was committed on a particular occasion.\n Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602. This categorical ap\n proach requires courts to choose the right category, and sometimes\n the choice is not obvious. The nature of the behavior that likely un\n derlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect. The state statute\n at issue places together in a single section several different kinds of\n behavior, which, as relevant here, may be categorized either as fail\n ure to report for detention or as escape from custody. Failure to re\n port is a separate crime from escape. Its underlying behavior differs\n from the more aggressive behavior underlying escape, and it is listed\n separately in the statute\u2019s title and body and is of a different felony\n2                    CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    class than escape. At the same time, the statutory phrases setting\n    forth the various kinds of failure to report describe roughly similar\n    forms of behavior, thus constituting a single category. Consequently,\n    for ACCA purposes, the statute contains at least two separate crimes,\n    escape and failure to report. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) The \u201cfailure to report\u201d crime does not satisfy ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent\n    felony\u201d definition. Although it is punishable by imprisonment ex\n    ceeding one year, it satisfies none of the other parts of the definition.\n    Most critically, it does not \u201cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious\n    potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Conceptually speaking,\n    the crime amounts to a form of inaction, and there is no reason to be\n    lieve that an offender who fails to report is otherwise doing some\n    thing that poses a serious potential risk of physical injury. The Gov\n    ernment\u2019s argument that a failure to report reveals the offender\u2019s\n    special, strong aversion to penal custody\u2014pointing to 3 state and\n    federal cases over 30 years in which individuals shot at officers at\n    tempting to recapture them\u2014is unconvincing. Even assuming the\n    relevance of violence that may occur long after an offender fails to re\n    port, the offender\u2019s aversion to penal custody is beside the point. The\n    question is whether such an offender is significantly more likely than\n    others to attack or resist an apprehender, thereby producing a seri\n    ous risk of physical injury. Here a United States Sentencing Com\n    mission report, showing no violence in 160 federal failure-to-report\n    cases over 2 recent years, helps provide a negative answer. The three\n    reported cases to which the Government points do not show the con\n    trary. Simple multiplication (2 years versus 30 years; federal alone\n    versus federal-plus-state) suggests that they show only a statistically\n    insignificant risk of physical violence. And the Government provides\n    no other empirical information. Pp. 5\u20138.\n473 F. 3d 724, reversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C.\n\u00a7924(e). We hold that it is not.\n                             I\n  The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) imposes a 15\nyear mandatory prison term on an individual convicted of\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm if that individual\nhas \u201cthree previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions\ndifferent from one another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1). ACCA defines a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d as a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment\nfor a term exceeding one year\u201d that also either\n    \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n    another; or\n    \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use\n    of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n2              CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    other.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\nClause (ii), ACCA\u2019s so-called residual clause, is at issue\nhere.\n                               II\n   The petitioner, Deondery Chambers, pleaded guilty to a\ncharge of being a felon unlawfully in possession of a fire\narm. \u00a7922(g). At sentencing the Government asked the\nDistrict Court to apply ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory prison\nterm because, in its view, three of Chambers\u2019 prior convic\ntions qualified as an ACCA \u201cserious drug offense\u201d or \u201cvio\nlent felony.\u201d Chambers conceded that two of his prior\nconvictions, namely a 1998 conviction for robbery and\naggravated battery and a 1999 drug crime conviction, fell\nwithin ACCA\u2019s definitions. But he disputed the Govern\nment\u2019s claim as to a third conviction. That third convic\ntion arose out of Chambers\u2019 sentence for his 1998 robbery\nand battery offense. The sentence required Chambers to\nreport to a local prison for 11 weekends of incarceration.\nHe failed to report for weekend confinement on four occa\nsions, and was later convicted of the crime of \u201cfail[ing] to\nreport to a penal institution.\u201d Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720,\n\u00a75/31\u20136(a) (West Supp. 2008).\n   The District Court treated the \u201cfailure to report\u201d as a\nform of what the relevant Illinois statute calls \u201cescape\nfrom [a] penal institution,\u201d ibid., and held that the crime\nqualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA. The Court of\nAppeals agreed. 473 F. 3d 724 (CA7 2007). In light of\ndisagreement among the Circuits as to whether failure to\nreport for imprisonment falls within the scope of ACCA\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d we granted certiorari. Com\npare United States v. Winn, 364 F. 3d 7, 12 (CA1 2004)\n(failure to report is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d), with United States\nv. Piccolo, 441 F. 3d 1084, 1088 (CA9 2006) (failure to\nreport is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009) \n          3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III \n\n   We initially consider the classification of the crime. In\nordinary speech, words such as \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201cfelony\u201d can\nrefer not only to a generic set of acts, say, burglary in\ngeneral, but also to a specific act committed on a particu\nlar occasion, say the burglary that the defendant engaged\nin last month. We have made clear, however, that, for\npurposes of ACCA\u2019s definitions, it is the generic sense of\nthe word \u201cfelony\u201d that counts. Taylor v. United States, 495\nU. S. 575, 602 (1990); see also Shepard v. United States,\n544 U. S. 13, 16\u201317 (2005). The statute\u2019s defining lan\nguage, read naturally, uses \u201cfelony\u201d to refer to a crime as\ngenerally committed. And by so construing the statute,\none avoids the practical difficulty of trying to ascertain at\nsentencing, perhaps from a paper record mentioning only\na guilty plea, whether the present defendant\u2019s prior crime,\nas committed on a particular occasion, did or did not in\nvolve violent behavior. See id., at 20\u201321. Thus, to deter\nmine, for example, whether attempted burglary is a \u201cvio\nlent felony,\u201d we have had to examine, not the unsuccessful\nburglary the defendant attempted on a particular occa\nsion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary. James\nv. United States, 550 U. S. 192, 204\u2013206 (2007).\n   This categorical approach requires courts to choose the\nright category. And sometimes the choice is not obvious.\nThe nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statu\ntory phrase matters in this respect. Where Massachu\nsetts, for example, placed within a single, separately\nnumbered statutory section (entitled \u201cBreaking and enter\ning at night,\u201d Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, \u00a716 (West\n2008)) burglary of a \u201cbuilding, ship, vessel or vehicle,\u201d this\nCourt found that the behavior underlying, say, breaking\ninto a building, differs so significantly from the behavior\nunderlying, say, breaking into a vehicle, that for ACCA\npurposes a sentencing court must treat the two as differ\nent crimes. See Shepard, supra, at 16\u201317; see also Taylor,\n4               CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 598.\n   The Illinois statute now before us, like the Massachu\nsetts statute, places together in a single numbered statu\ntory section several different kinds of behavior. It sepa\nrately describes those behaviors as (1) escape from a penal\ninstitution, (2) escape from the custody of an employee of a\npenal institution, (3) failing to report to a penal institu\ntion, (4) failing to report for periodic imprisonment, (5)\nfailing to return from furlough, (6) failing to return from\nwork and day release, and (7) failing to abide by the terms\nof home confinement. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a75/31\u20136(a);\nsee Appendix A, infra. We know from the state-court\ninformation in the record that Chambers pleaded guilty to\n\u201cknowingly fail[ing] to report\u201d for periodic imprisonment\n\u201cto the Jefferson County Jail, a penal institution.\u201d App.\n68; see Shepard, supra, at 25 (sentencing court may look,\nfor example, to charging document, plea agreement, jury\ninstructions, or transcript of plea colloquy to determine\ncrime at issue). But we must decide whether for ACCA\npurposes a failure to report counts as a separate crime.\n   Unlike the lower courts, we believe that a failure to\nreport (as described in the statutory provision\u2019s third,\nfourth, fifth, and sixth phrases) is a separate crime, differ\nent from escape (the subject matter of the statute\u2019s first\nand second phrases), and from the potentially less serious\nfailure to abide by the terms of home confinement (the\nsubject of the final phrase). The behavior that likely\nunderlies a failure to report would seem less likely to\ninvolve a risk of physical harm than the less passive, more\naggressive behavior underlying an escape from custody.\nSee Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip\nop., at 7). Moreover, the statute itself not only lists escape\nand failure to report separately (in its title and its body)\nbut also places the behaviors in two different felony\nclasses (Class Two and Class Three) of different degrees of\nseriousness. See Appendix A, infra.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  At the same time, we believe the statutory phrases\nsetting forth various kinds of failure to report (or to re\nturn) describe roughly similar forms of behavior. Each is\ncharacterized by a failure to present oneself for detention\non a specified occasion. All amount to variations on a\nsingle theme. For that reason we consider them as to\ngether constituting a single category. Cf. James, supra, at\n207\u2013209 (determining that where separately listed behav\niors pose a similar degree of risk, sentencing courts may\nconsider all listed behaviors as a single crime). We conse\nquently treat the statute for ACCA purposes as containing\nat least two separate crimes, namely escape from custody\non the one hand, and a failure to report on the other.\nFailure to abide by home confinement terms\u2014potentially\nthe least serious of the offenses\u2014is not at issue here.\n                               IV\n  We now must consider whether the \u201cfailure to report\u201d\ncrime satisfies ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. It\nclearly satisfies the first part of that definition, for it is a\n\u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding\none year.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B). But it satisfies none\nof the other parts. It does not have \u201cas an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst the person of another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). It does\nnot consist of \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion,\u201d or \u201cinvolv[e]\nuse of explosives.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). And, more critically\nfor present purposes, it does not \u201c \u2018involve conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\u2019 \u201d See Begay, 553 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2\u20134);\nid., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\nment) (treating serious risk of physical injury to another\nas critical definitional factor); id., at ___ (slip op., at 2)\n(ALITO, J., dissenting) (same).\n  Conceptually speaking, the crime amounts to a form of\ninaction, a far cry from the \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and\n6              CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d potentially at issue when an offender\nuses explosives against property, commits arson, burgles a\ndwelling or residence, or engages in certain forms of extor\ntion. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). While an offender who\nfails to report must of course be doing something at the\nrelevant time, there is no reason to believe that the some\nthing poses a serious potential risk of physical injury. Cf.\nJames, 550 U. S., at 203\u2013204. To the contrary, an indi\nvidual who fails to report would seem unlikely, not likely,\nto call attention to his whereabouts by simultaneously\nengaging in additional violent and unlawful conduct.\n   The Government argues that a failure to report reveals\nthe offender\u2019s special, strong aversion to penal custody.\nAnd it points to three cases arising over a period of 30\nyears in which reported opinions indicate that individuals\nshot at officers attempting to recapture them. See United\nStates v. Eaglin, 571 F. 2d 1069, 1072 (CA9 1977); State v.\nJohnson, 245 S. W. 3d 288, 291 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008); State\nv. Jones, 96 Wash. App. 369, 371\u2013372, 979 P. 2d 898, 899\n(1999). But even if we assume for argument\u2019s sake the\nrelevance of violence that may occur long after an offender\nfails to report, we are not convinced by the Government\u2019s\nargument. The offender\u2019s aversion to penal custody, even\nif special, is beside the point. The question is whether\nsuch an offender is significantly more likely than others to\nattack, or physically to resist, an apprehender, thereby\nproducing a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). And here a United States Sentencing\nCommission report helps provide a conclusive, negative\nanswer. See Report on Federal Escape Offenses in Fiscal\nYears 2006 and 2007, p. 6 (Nov. 2008) (hereinafter Com\nmission\u2019s Report), reprinted in part in Appendix B, infra.\nSee also 473 F. 3d, at 727 (Posner, J.) (urging that such\nresearch be done).\n   The Commission\u2019s Report identifies every federal case in\n2006 or 2007 in which a federal sentencing court applied\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Sentencing Guideline, \u201cEscape, Instigating or Assist\ning Escape,\u201d 1 United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a72P1.1 (Nov. 2008), and in which\nsufficient detail was provided, say, in the presentence\nreport, about the circumstances of the crime to permit\nanalysis. The analysis included calculation of the likeli\nhood that violence would accompany commission of the\nescape or the offender\u2019s later apprehension.\n   Of 414 such cases, 160 involved a failure to report either\nfor incarceration (42) or for custody after having been\ntemporarily released (118). Commission\u2019s Report 7; see\nalso Appendix B, infra. Of these 160 cases, none at all\ninvolved violence\u2014not during commission of the offense\nitself, not during the offender\u2019s later apprehension\u2014\nalthough in 5 instances (3.1%) the offenders were armed.\nIbid. The upshot is that the study strongly supports the\nintuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a\nserious potential risk of physical injury.\n   The three reported cases to which the Government\npoints do not show the contrary. The Sentencing Commis\nsion culled its 160 instances from a set of federal sentences\nimposed over a period of 2 years. The Government appar\nently culled its three examples from a set of state and\nfederal sentences imposed over a period of 30 years. Com\npare Eaglin, supra (CA9 1977) with Johnson, supra (Mo.\nCt. App. 2008). Given the larger set, the presence of three\ninstances of violence is consistent with the Commission\u2019s\ndata. Simple multiplication (2 years versus 30 years;\nfederal alone versus federal-plus-state) suggests that they\nshow only a small risk of physical violence (less than one\nin several thousand). And the Government provides no\nother empirical information.\n   For these reasons we conclude that the crime here at\nissue falls outside the scope of ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cvio\nlent felony.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n602 (1990). In light of Taylor and Begay, I agree that this\ncase should be remanded for resentencing. I write sepa\nrately, however, to emphasize that only Congress can\nrescue the federal courts from the mire into which ACCA\u2019s\ndraftsmanship and Taylor\u2019s \u201ccategorical approach\u201d have\npushed us.\n   In 1986, when Congress enacted ACCA\u2019s residual\nclause, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), few could have fore\nseen the difficulties that lay ahead.1 Only four months\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 Congress   originally enacted ACCA in 1984.       See \u00a71802, 93 Stat.\n2                  CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbefore Congress framed the residual clause, this Court\nupheld a state sentencing provision that imposed a man\ndatory minimum sentence where the judge found by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant visibly\npossessed a firearm during the commission of certain\nfelonies (including robbery). See McMillan v. Pennsyl\nvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986). Legislating against the back\nground of McMillan, Congress may have assumed that\nACCA\u2019s residual clause would similarly require federal\nsentencing judges to determine whether the particular\nfacts of a particular case triggered a mandatory minimum\nsentence.\n   But history took a different track. In Taylor, the Court\nheld that ACCA requires \u201cthe sentencing court to look only\nto the fact that the defendant had been convicted of crimes\nfalling within certain categories, and not to the facts\nunderlying the prior convictions.\u201d 495 U. S., at 600. Thus,\nwe held that sentencing judges should apply a \u201ccategorical\napproach\u201d to determine whether an underlying state\noffense meets the \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary that this\nCourt\u2014not Congress\u2014created. Id., at 598. The Court\njustified its decision with a 10-page discussion of ACCA\u2019s\npurpose and legislative history, id., at 581\u2013590; see also\nid., at 603 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (criticizing the Court\u2019s approach), and ex\nplained that its conclusion was necessary to undo \u201can\ninadvertent casualty [in ACCA\u2019s] complex drafting proc\ness,\u201d id., at 589\u2013590.\n   ACCA\u2019s clarity has been the true inadvertent casualty.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n2185, 18 U.

That\nstatute, however, applied a mandatory sentencing enhancement to only\ntwo predicate felonies\u2014robbery and burglary\u2014which the statute\nexpressly defined. 18 U. S. C. App. \u00a7\u00a71202(c)(8)\u2013(9) (1982 ed., Supp. II).\nCongress did not add the undefined \u201cotherwise clause\u201d until 1986.

Indeed, the \u201ccate\ngorical approach\u201d to predicate offenses has created numer\nous splits among the lower federal courts,2 the resolution\nof which could occupy this Court for years. What is worse\nis that each new application of the residual clause seems\nto lead us further and further away from the statutory\ntext. Today\u2019s decision, for example, turns on little more\nthan a statistical analysis of a research report prepared by\nthe United States Sentencing Commission. Ante, at 6\u20137;\n10 (App. B).\n   At this point, the only tenable, long-term solution is for\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 For example, the lower courts have split over whether it is a \u201cviolent\n\nfelony\u201d under ACCA\u2019s residual clause to commit rape, compare United\nStates v. Sawyers, 409 F. 3d 732 (CA6 2005) (statutory rape not cate\ngorically violent), with United States v. Williams, 120 F. 3d 575 (CA5\n1997) (inducement of minor to commit sodomy violent), and United\nStates v. Thomas, 231 Fed.

Mont\ngomery, 402 F. 3d 482 (CA5 2005) (not violent), with Sawyers, supra\n(violent); attempt or conspire to commit burglary, compare United\nStates v. Fell, 511 F. 3d 1035 (CA10 2007) (even after James v. United\nStates, 550 U. S. 192 (2007), and even where statute requires an overt\nact, conspiracy to commit burglary not violent), with United States v.\nMoore, 108 F. 3d 878 (CA8 1997) (attempted burglary violent if statute\nrequires proof of overt act); carry a concealed weapon, compare United\nStates v. Whitfield, 907 F. 2d 798 (CA8 1990) (not violent), with United\nStates v. Hall, 77 F. 3d 398 (CA11 1996) (violent); and possess a sawed\noff shotgun as a felon, compare United States v. Amos, 501 F. 3d 524\n(CA6 2007) (not violent), with United States v. Bishop, 453 F. 3d 30\n(CA1 2006) (violent). Compare also United States v.

Argued November 10, 2008\u2014Decided January 13, 2009\nThe Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) imposes a 15-year mandatory\n  prison term on a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm who has\n  three prior convictions for committing certain drug crimes or \u201ca vio\n  lent felony,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1), defined as a crime punishable by\n  more than one year\u2019s imprisonment that, inter alia, \u201cinvolves conduct\n  that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d\n  \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). At petitioner Chambers\u2019 sentencing for being a felon\n  in possession of a firearm, the Government sought ACCA\u2019s 15-year\n  mandatory prison term. Chambers disputed one of his prior convic\n  tions\u2014failing to report for weekend confinement\u2014as falling outside\n  the ACCA definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d The District Court treated\n  the failure to report as a form of what the relevant state statute calls\n  \u201cescape from [a] penal institution,\u201d and held that it qualified as a\n  \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA. The Seventh Circuit agreed.\nHeld: Illinois\u2019 crime of failure to report for penal confinement falls out\n side the scope of ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. Pp. 3\u20138.\n    (a) For purposes of ACCA\u2019s definitions, it is the generic crime that\n counts, not how the crime was committed on a particular occasion.\n Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 602. This categorical ap\n proach requires courts to choose the right category, and sometimes\n the choice is not obvious. The nature of the behavior that likely un\n derlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect. The state statute\n at issue places together in a single section several different kinds of\n behavior, which, as relevant here, may be categorized either as fail\n ure to report for detention or as escape from custody. Failure to re\n port is a separate crime from escape. Its underlying behavior differs\n from the more aggressive behavior underlying escape, and it is listed\n separately in the statute\u2019s title and body and is of a different felony\n2                    CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    class than escape. At the same time, the statutory phrases setting\n    forth the various kinds of failure to report describe roughly similar\n    forms of behavior, thus constituting a single category. Consequently,\n    for ACCA purposes, the statute contains at least two separate crimes,\n    escape and failure to report. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) The \u201cfailure to report\u201d crime does not satisfy ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent\n    felony\u201d definition. Although it is punishable by imprisonment ex\n    ceeding one year, it satisfies none of the other parts of the definition.\n    Most critically, it does not \u201cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious\n    potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Conceptually speaking,\n    the crime amounts to a form of inaction, and there is no reason to be\n    lieve that an offender who fails to report is otherwise doing some\n    thing that poses a serious potential risk of physical injury. The Gov\n    ernment\u2019s argument that a failure to report reveals the offender\u2019s\n    special, strong aversion to penal custody\u2014pointing to 3 state and\n    federal cases over 30 years in which individuals shot at officers at\n    tempting to recapture them\u2014is unconvincing. Even assuming the\n    relevance of violence that may occur long after an offender fails to re\n    port, the offender\u2019s aversion to penal custody is beside the point. The\n    question is whether such an offender is significantly more likely than\n    others to attack or resist an apprehender, thereby producing a seri\n    ous risk of physical injury. Here a United States Sentencing Com\n    mission report, showing no violence in 160 federal failure-to-report\n    cases over 2 recent years, helps provide a negative answer. The three\n    reported cases to which the Government points do not show the con\n    trary. Simple multiplication (2 years versus 30 years; federal alone\n    versus federal-plus-state) suggests that they show only a statistically\n    insignificant risk of physical violence. And the Government provides\n    no other empirical information. Pp. 5\u20138.\n473 F. 3d 724, reversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C.\n\u00a7924(e). We hold that it is not.\n                             I\n  The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) imposes a 15\nyear mandatory prison term on an individual convicted of\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm if that individual\nhas \u201cthree previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions\ndifferent from one another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1). ACCA defines a\n\u201cviolent felony\u201d as a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment\nfor a term exceeding one year\u201d that also either\n    \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\n    another; or\n    \u201c(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use\n    of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an\n2              CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    other.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\nClause (ii), ACCA\u2019s so-called residual clause, is at issue\nhere.\n                               II\n   The petitioner, Deondery Chambers, pleaded guilty to a\ncharge of being a felon unlawfully in possession of a fire\narm. \u00a7922(g). At sentencing the Government asked the\nDistrict Court to apply ACCA\u2019s 15-year mandatory prison\nterm because, in its view, three of Chambers\u2019 prior convic\ntions qualified as an ACCA \u201cserious drug offense\u201d or \u201cvio\nlent felony.\u201d Chambers conceded that two of his prior\nconvictions, namely a 1998 conviction for robbery and\naggravated battery and a 1999 drug crime conviction, fell\nwithin ACCA\u2019s definitions. But he disputed the Govern\nment\u2019s claim as to a third conviction. That third convic\ntion arose out of Chambers\u2019 sentence for his 1998 robbery\nand battery offense. The sentence required Chambers to\nreport to a local prison for 11 weekends of incarceration.\nHe failed to report for weekend confinement on four occa\nsions, and was later convicted of the crime of \u201cfail[ing] to\nreport to a penal institution.\u201d Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720,\n\u00a75/31\u20136(a) (West Supp. 2008).\n   The District Court treated the \u201cfailure to report\u201d as a\nform of what the relevant Illinois statute calls \u201cescape\nfrom [a] penal institution,\u201d ibid., and held that the crime\nqualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA. The Court of\nAppeals agreed. 473 F. 3d 724 (CA7 2007). In light of\ndisagreement among the Circuits as to whether failure to\nreport for imprisonment falls within the scope of ACCA\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201cviolent felony,\u201d we granted certiorari.

S. ____ (2009) \n          3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             III \n\n   We initially consider the classification of the crime. In\nordinary speech, words such as \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201cfelony\u201d can\nrefer not only to a generic set of acts, say, burglary in\ngeneral, but also to a specific act committed on a particu\nlar occasion, say the burglary that the defendant engaged\nin last month. We have made clear, however, that, for\npurposes of ACCA\u2019s definitions, it is the generic sense of\nthe word \u201cfelony\u201d that counts. Taylor v. United States, 495\nU. S. 575, 602 (1990); see also Shepard v. United States,\n544 U. S. 13, 16\u201317 (2005). The statute\u2019s defining lan\nguage, read naturally, uses \u201cfelony\u201d to refer to a crime as\ngenerally committed. And by so construing the statute,\none avoids the practical difficulty of trying to ascertain at\nsentencing, perhaps from a paper record mentioning only\na guilty plea, whether the present defendant\u2019s prior crime,\nas committed on a particular occasion, did or did not in\nvolve violent behavior. See id., at 20\u201321. Thus, to deter\nmine, for example, whether attempted burglary is a \u201cvio\nlent felony,\u201d we have had to examine, not the unsuccessful\nburglary the defendant attempted on a particular occa\nsion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary. James\nv. United States, 550 U. S. 192, 204\u2013206 (2007).\n   This categorical approach requires courts to choose the\nright category. And sometimes the choice is not obvious.\nThe nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statu\ntory phrase matters in this respect. Where Massachu\nsetts, for example, placed within a single, separately\nnumbered statutory section (entitled \u201cBreaking and enter\ning at night,\u201d Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, \u00a716 (West\n2008)) burglary of a \u201cbuilding, ship, vessel or vehicle,\u201d this\nCourt found that the behavior underlying, say, breaking\ninto a building, differs so significantly from the behavior\nunderlying, say, breaking into a vehicle, that for ACCA\npurposes a sentencing court must treat the two as differ\nent crimes. See Shepard, supra, at 16\u201317; see also Taylor,\n4               CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 598.\n   The Illinois statute now before us, like the Massachu\nsetts statute, places together in a single numbered statu\ntory section several different kinds of behavior. It sepa\nrately describes those behaviors as (1) escape from a penal\ninstitution, (2) escape from the custody of an employee of a\npenal institution, (3) failing to report to a penal institu\ntion, (4) failing to report for periodic imprisonment, (5)\nfailing to return from furlough, (6) failing to return from\nwork and day release, and (7) failing to abide by the terms\nof home confinement. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \u00a75/31\u20136(a);\nsee Appendix A, infra. We know from the state-court\ninformation in the record that Chambers pleaded guilty to\n\u201cknowingly fail[ing] to report\u201d for periodic imprisonment\n\u201cto the Jefferson County Jail, a penal institution.\u201d App.\n68; see Shepard, supra, at 25 (sentencing court may look,\nfor example, to charging document, plea agreement, jury\ninstructions, or transcript of plea colloquy to determine\ncrime at issue). But we must decide whether for ACCA\npurposes a failure to report counts as a separate crime.\n   Unlike the lower courts, we believe that a failure to\nreport (as described in the statutory provision\u2019s third,\nfourth, fifth, and sixth phrases) is a separate crime, differ\nent from escape (the subject matter of the statute\u2019s first\nand second phrases), and from the potentially less serious\nfailure to abide by the terms of home confinement (the\nsubject of the final phrase). The behavior that likely\nunderlies a failure to report would seem less likely to\ninvolve a risk of physical harm than the less passive, more\naggressive behavior underlying an escape from custody.\nSee Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip\nop., at 7). Moreover, the statute itself not only lists escape\nand failure to report separately (in its title and its body)\nbut also places the behaviors in two different felony\nclasses (Class Two and Class Three) of different degrees of\nseriousness. See Appendix A, infra.\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  At the same time, we believe the statutory phrases\nsetting forth various kinds of failure to report (or to re\nturn) describe roughly similar forms of behavior. Each is\ncharacterized by a failure to present oneself for detention\non a specified occasion. All amount to variations on a\nsingle theme. For that reason we consider them as to\ngether constituting a single category. Cf. James, supra, at\n207\u2013209 (determining that where separately listed behav\niors pose a similar degree of risk, sentencing courts may\nconsider all listed behaviors as a single crime). We conse\nquently treat the statute for ACCA purposes as containing\nat least two separate crimes, namely escape from custody\non the one hand, and a failure to report on the other.\nFailure to abide by home confinement terms\u2014potentially\nthe least serious of the offenses\u2014is not at issue here.\n                               IV\n  We now must consider whether the \u201cfailure to report\u201d\ncrime satisfies ACCA\u2019s \u201cviolent felony\u201d definition. It\nclearly satisfies the first part of that definition, for it is a\n\u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding\none year.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B). But it satisfies none\nof the other parts. It does not have \u201cas an element the\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst the person of another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). It does\nnot consist of \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion,\u201d or \u201cinvolv[e]\nuse of explosives.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). And, more critically\nfor present purposes, it does not \u201c \u2018involve conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\nanother.\u2019 \u201d See Begay, 553 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2\u20134);\nid., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg\nment) (treating serious risk of physical injury to another\nas critical definitional factor); id., at ___ (slip op., at 2)\n(ALITO, J., dissenting) (same).\n  Conceptually speaking, the crime amounts to a form of\ninaction, a far cry from the \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and\n6              CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d potentially at issue when an offender\nuses explosives against property, commits arson, burgles a\ndwelling or residence, or engages in certain forms of extor\ntion. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). While an offender who\nfails to report must of course be doing something at the\nrelevant time, there is no reason to believe that the some\nthing poses a serious potential risk of physical injury. Cf.\nJames, 550 U. S., at 203\u2013204. To the contrary, an indi\nvidual who fails to report would seem unlikely, not likely,\nto call attention to his whereabouts by simultaneously\nengaging in additional violent and unlawful conduct.\n   The Government argues that a failure to report reveals\nthe offender\u2019s special, strong aversion to penal custody.\nAnd it points to three cases arising over a period of 30\nyears in which reported opinions indicate that individuals\nshot at officers attempting to recapture them. See United\nStates v. Eaglin, 571 F. 2d 1069, 1072 (CA9 1977); State v.\nJohnson, 245 S. W. 3d 288, 291 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008); State\nv.

But even if we assume for argument\u2019s sake the\nrelevance of violence that may occur long after an offender\nfails to report, we are not convinced by the Government\u2019s\nargument. The offender\u2019s aversion to penal custody, even\nif special, is beside the point. The question is whether\nsuch an offender is significantly more likely than others to\nattack, or physically to resist, an apprehender, thereby\nproducing a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury.\u201d\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). And here a United States Sentencing\nCommission report helps provide a conclusive, negative\nanswer. See Report on Federal Escape Offenses in Fiscal\nYears 2006 and 2007, p. 6 (Nov. 2008) (hereinafter Com\nmission\u2019s Report), reprinted in part in Appendix B, infra.\nSee also 473 F. 3d, at 727 (Posner, J.) (urging that such\nresearch be done).\n   The Commission\u2019s Report identifies every federal case in\n2006 or 2007 in which a federal sentencing court applied\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Sentencing Guideline, \u201cEscape, Instigating or Assist\ning Escape,\u201d 1 United States Sentencing Commission,\nGuidelines Manual \u00a72P1.1 (Nov. 2008), and in which\nsufficient detail was provided, say, in the presentence\nreport, about the circumstances of the crime to permit\nanalysis. The analysis included calculation of the likeli\nhood that violence would accompany commission of the\nescape or the offender\u2019s later apprehension.\n   Of 414 such cases, 160 involved a failure to report either\nfor incarceration (42) or for custody after having been\ntemporarily released (118). Commission\u2019s Report 7; see\nalso Appendix B, infra. Of these 160 cases, none at all\ninvolved violence\u2014not during commission of the offense\nitself, not during the offender\u2019s later apprehension\u2014\nalthough in 5 instances (3.1%) the offenders were armed.\nIbid. The upshot is that the study strongly supports the\nintuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a\nserious potential risk of physical injury.\n   The three reported cases to which the Government\npoints do not show the contrary. The Sentencing Commis\nsion culled its 160 instances from a set of federal sentences\nimposed over a period of 2 years. The Government appar\nently culled its three examples from a set of state and\nfederal sentences imposed over a period of 30 years. Com\npare Eaglin, supra (CA9 1977) with Johnson, supra (Mo.\nCt. App. 2008). Given the larger set, the presence of three\ninstances of violence is consistent with the Commission\u2019s\ndata. Simple multiplication (2 years versus 30 years;\nfederal alone versus federal-plus-state) suggests that they\nshow only a small risk of physical violence (less than one\nin several thousand). And the Government provides no\nother empirical information.\n   For these reasons we conclude that the crime here at\nissue falls outside the scope of ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cvio\nlent felony.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n602 (1990). In light of Taylor and Begay, I agree that this\ncase should be remanded for resentencing. I write sepa\nrately, however, to emphasize that only Congress can\nrescue the federal courts from the mire into which ACCA\u2019s\ndraftsmanship and Taylor\u2019s \u201ccategorical approach\u201d have\npushed us.\n   In 1986, when Congress enacted ACCA\u2019s residual\nclause, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), few could have fore\nseen the difficulties that lay ahead.1 Only four months\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 Congress   originally enacted ACCA in 1984.

UNITED STATES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbefore Congress framed the residual clause, this Court\nupheld a state sentencing provision that imposed a man\ndatory minimum sentence where the judge found by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant visibly\npossessed a firearm during the commission of certain\nfelonies (including robbery). See McMillan v. Pennsyl\nvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986). Legislating against the back\nground of McMillan, Congress may have assumed that\nACCA\u2019s residual clause would similarly require federal\nsentencing judges to determine whether the particular\nfacts of a particular case triggered a mandatory minimum\nsentence.\n   But history took a different track. In Taylor, the Court\nheld that ACCA requires \u201cthe sentencing court to look only\nto the fact that the defendant had been convicted of crimes\nfalling within certain categories, and not to the facts\nunderlying the prior convictions.\u201d 495 U. S., at 600. Thus,\nwe held that sentencing judges should apply a \u201ccategorical\napproach\u201d to determine whether an underlying state\noffense meets the \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary that this\nCourt\u2014not Congress\u2014created. Id., at 598. The Court\njustified its decision with a 10-page discussion of ACCA\u2019s\npurpose and legislative history, id., at 581\u2013590; see also\nid., at 603 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (criticizing the Court\u2019s approach), and ex\nplained that its conclusion was necessary to undo \u201can\ninadvertent casualty [in ACCA\u2019s] complex drafting proc\ness,\u201d id., at 589\u2013590.\n   ACCA\u2019s clarity has been the true inadvertent casualty.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n2185, 18 U.

Indeed, the \u201ccate\ngorical approach\u201d to predicate offenses has created numer\nous splits among the lower federal courts,2 the resolution\nof which could occupy this Court for years. What is worse\nis that each new application of the residual clause seems\nto lead us further and further away from the statutory\ntext. Today\u2019s decision, for example, turns on little more\nthan a statistical analysis of a research report prepared by\nthe United States Sentencing Commission.

Galvan-Rodriguez, 169 F. 3d 217 (CA5\n1999) (per curiam) (unauthorized use of a motor vehicle a \u201cviolent\nfelony\u201d under \u00a716(b)).\n4              CHAMBERS v. UNITED STATES\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCongress to formulate a specific list of expressly defined\ncrimes that are deemed to be worthy of ACCA\u2019s sentencing\nenhancement. That is the approach that Congress took in\n1984, when it applied ACCA to two enumerated and ex\npressly defined felonies. See n. 1, supra. And that ap\nproach is the only way to right ACCA\u2019s ship.\n</pre>",
