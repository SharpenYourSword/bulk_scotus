QUARTERMAN, DIRECTOR, TEXAS \n\n   DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORREC-\n\n         TIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 07\u20136984. Argued November 4, 2008\u2014Decided January 13, 2009\nAfter petitioner\u2019s state conviction for burglary became final on October\n  11, 1996, the state appellate court held in state habeas proceedings\n  that petitioner had been denied his right to appeal and granted him\n  the right to file an out-of-time appeal. He filed the appeal, his convic\n  tion was affirmed, and his time for seeking certiorari in this Court\n  expired on January 6, 2004. Petitioner filed a second state habeas\n  application on December 6, 2004, which was denied 355 days later,\n  on June 29, 2005. He then filed a federal habeas petition on July 19,\n  2005, relying on 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) to establish its timeliness.\n  Section 2244(d)(1)(A) provides that the one-year limitations period for\n  seeking review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\n  Act of 1996 (AEDPA) begins on \u201cthe date on which the judgment be\n  came final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the\n  time for seeking such review.\u201d Petitioner argued that his judgment\n  became final on January 6, 2004, when time expired for seeking cer\n  tiorari review of the decision in his out-of-time appeal, and that his\n  July 19, 2005, petition was timely because the calculation of\n  AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitation period excludes the 355 days \u201cduring\n  which [his] properly filed application for State post-conviction . . . re\n  view . . . [was] pending,\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2). The District Court disagreed,\n  ruling that the proper start date for calculating AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limi\n  tations period under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) was October 11, 1996, when peti\n  tioner\u2019s conviction first became final. The District Court dismissed\n  the federal habeas petition as time barred. The Fifth Circuit denied\n  petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability.\n2                     JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: Where a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file\n an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before\n the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is\n not \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) until the conclusion of the\n out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking\n certiorari review of that appeal. This Court must enforce plain statu\n tory language according to its terms. See, e.g., Lamie v. United\n States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534. Under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A)\u2019s plain lan\n guage, once the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reopened direct re\n view of petitioner\u2019s conviction on September 25, 2002, the conviction\n was no longer final for \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) purposes. Rather, the order\n granting an out-of-time appeal restored the pendency of the direct\n appeal, and petitioner\u2019s conviction was again capable of modification\n through direct appeal to the state courts and to this Court on certio\n rari review. Therefore, it was not until January 6, 2004, when time\n for seeking certiorari review of the decision in the out-of-time appeal\n expired, that petitioner\u2019s conviction became \u201cfinal\u201d through \u201cthe con\n clusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such\n review\u201d under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). The Court rejects respondent\u2019s argu\n ment that using the later date created by the state court\u2019s decision to\n reopen direct review, thus resetting AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitations pe\n riod, undermines the policy of finality that Congress established in\n \u00a72244(d)(1).

NATHANIEL \n\n    QUARTERMAN, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPART- \n\n     MENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORREC- \n\n        TIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [January 13, 2009] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) establishes a 1-year time limitation for a\nstate prisoner to file a federal habeas corpus petition.\nThat year runs from the latest of four specified dates. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1). This case involves the date provided\nby \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), which is \u201cthe date on which the judg\u00ad\nment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\nexpiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d Petitioner\ncontends that \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal\u201d can be postponed by a state court\u2019s decision during\ncollateral review to grant a defendant the right to file an\nout-of-time direct appeal. The District Court disagreed,\nholding instead that the date could not be moved to reflect\nthe out-of-time appeal, and that petitioner\u2019s federal ha\u00ad\nbeas petition was untimely for that reason. The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a\ncertificate of appealability. See \u00a72253(c). We now reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for\n2                    JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                 I\n   After petitioner was sentenced for burglary in 1995, his\nattorney filed an appellate brief with the Texas Court of\nAppeals pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738\n(1967), explaining that he was unable to identify any\nnonfrivolous ground on which to base an appeal.1 He left a\ncopy of the brief and a letter (advising petitioner of his\nright to file a pro se brief as set forth in Anders, id., at 744)\nat the county jail where he believed petitioner to be.\nPetitioner, however, had been transferred to a state facil\u00ad\nity and did not receive the delivery. The Texas Court of\nAppeals dismissed the appeal on September 11, 1996, and\nserved petitioner with notice of the dismissal at the\ncounty-jail address that, again, was the wrong address.\n   Petitioner eventually learned that his appeal had been\ndismissed. He filed an application in state court for a writ\nof habeas corpus pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,\nArt. 11.07 (Vernon 1977), arguing that he was denied his\nright to a meaningful appeal when he was denied the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Petitioner was indicted in August 1991 for felony burglary of a habi\u00ad\n\ntation, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a730.02 (Vernon 1989),\nenhanced by a prior felony conviction for aggravated assault with a\ndeadly weapon under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a712.42(c) (Vernon 1974).\nHe entered a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to the\nburglary and true to the enhancement in exchange for an order of\ndeferred adjudication. In November 1991, the trial court deferred\nadjudication of the burglary conviction and ordered that petitioner\nserve five years of deferred-adjudication probation. In March 1995, the\nState moved to revoke petitioner\u2019s probation based on four alleged\nviolations of the conditions of his probation. At a November 1995\nhearing, petitioner admitted to two of the violations. The court then\nheard testimony with respect to the other two violations and found that\npetitioner had committed those violations as well. The court revoked\npetitioner\u2019s deferred-adjudication probation, adjudicated him guilty\nof the enhanced burglary, and sentenced him to a 43-year term of\nimprisonment.\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nopportunity to file a pro se brief. The Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals agreed and, on September 25, 2002,\ngranted petitioner the right to file an out-of-time appeal:\n     \u201c[Petitioner] is entitled to an out-of-time appeal in\n     cause number CR\u201391\u20130528\u2013B in the 119th Judicial\n     District Court of Tom Green County. [Petitioner] is\n     ordered returned to that point in time at which he\n     may give written notice of appeal so that he may then,\n     with the aid of counsel, obtain a meaningful appeal.\n     For purposes of the Texas Rules of Appellate Proce\u00ad\n     dure, all time limits shall be calculated as if the sen\u00ad\n     tence had been imposed on the date that the mandate\n     of this Court issues.\u201d Ex parte Jimenez, No. 74,433\n     (per curiam), App. 26, 27.\n   Petitioner thereafter filed the out-of-time appeal. His\nconviction was affirmed. The Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals denied discretionary review on October 8, 2003.\nTime for seeking certiorari review of that decision with\nthis Court expired on January 6, 2004. On December 6,\n2004, petitioner filed a second application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus in state court; it was denied on June 29,\n2005.\n   Petitioner then filed a federal petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus on July 19, 2005. To establish the timeli\u00ad\nness of his petition, he relied on 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A),\nwhich provides \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of\nthe time for seeking such review\u201d as the trigger for\nAEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitations period. Petitioner argued that\nhis judgment thus became final on January 6, 2004,2 when\ntime expired for seeking certiorari review of the decision\nin his out-of-time appeal. Until that date, petitioner ar\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In the District Court, petitioner contended that this date was Janu\u00ad\n\nary 8, 2004, but petitioner\u2019s time for seeking certiorari review actually\nexpired two days earlier.\n4                JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngued, direct review of his state-court conviction was not\ncomplete.\n   With January 6, 2004, as the start date, petitioner\ncontended that his July 19, 2005, petition was timely\nbecause the statute excludes from the 1-year limitations\nperiod \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed applica\u00ad\ntion for State post-conviction or other collateral review\nwith respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pend\u00ad\ning.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2). Petitioner had a state habeas applica\u00ad\ntion pending from December 6, 2004, through June 29,\n2005, so less than one year of included time\u2014specifically,\n355 days\u2014passed between January 6, 2004, and July 19,\n2005.\n   The District Court disagreed and dismissed the federal\nhabeas petition as time barred. In the District Court\u2019s\nview, the proper start date for AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitations\nperiod was October 11, 1996, when time for seeking discre\u00ad\ntionary review of the decision in petitioner\u2019s first direct\nappeal expired. The District Court concluded that it could\nnot take into account the Texas court\u2019s later decision\nreopening petitioner\u2019s direct appeal because Circuit prece\u00ad\ndent established that \u201c \u2018AEDPA provides for only a linear\nlimitations period, one that starts and ends on specific\ndates, with only the possibility that tolling will expand the\nperiod in between.\u2019 \u201d Order, Civ. Action No. 6:05\u2013CV\u201305\u2013C\n(ND Tex., Oct. 23, 2006), App. 75, 90 (quoting Salinas v.\nDretke, 354 F. 3d 425, 429 (CA5 2004)). Therefore, the\nDistrict Court reasoned, the limitations period began on\nOctober 11, 1996, and ended on October 11, 1997, because\npetitioner had not sought any state or federal collateral\nreview by that date.\n   The Court of Appeals denied petitioner\u2019s request for a\ncertificate of appealability, finding that he had \u201cfailed to\ndemonstrate that reasonable jurists would debate the\ncorrectness of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u00a72254\npetition is time-barred.\u201d Order, No. 06\u201311240, (May 25,\n                     Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n2007), App. 124, 125. We granted certiorari, 552 U. S.\n___ (2008), and now reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.3\n                              II\n   As with any question of statutory interpretation, our\nanalysis begins with the plain language of the statute.\nLamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004).\nIt is well established that, when the statutory language is\nplain, we must enforce it according to its terms. See, e.g.,\nDodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 359 (2005); Lamie,\nsupra, at 534; Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union\nPlanters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000); Caminetti v.\nUnited States, 242 U. S. 470, 485 (1917).\n   The parties agree that the statutory provision that\ndetermines the timeliness of petitioner\u2019s habeas petition is\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). That subsection defines the\nstarting date for purposes of the 1-year AEDPA limita\u00ad\ntions period as \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of\nthe time for seeking such review.\u201d The only disputed\nquestion before us is whether the date on which direct\nreview became \u201cfinal\u201d under the statute is October 11,\n1996, when petitioner\u2019s conviction initially became final,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 We do not decide whether petitioner is entitled to a certificate of\n\nappealability on remand because we are presented solely with the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision on the timeliness of the petition under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d). \u201cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on\nprocedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying consti\u00ad\ntutional claim,\u201d as here, a certificate of appealability should issue only\nwhen the prisoner shows both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it\ndebatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a\nconstitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable\nwhether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d Slack\nv. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000) (emphasis added). We make no\njudgment regarding the merits of petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional\nclaims.\n6                JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor January 6, 2004, when the out-of-time appeal granted\nby the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals became final. We\nagree with petitioner that, under the plain meaning of the\nstatutory text, the latter date controls.\n   Finality is a concept that has been \u201cvariously defined;\nlike many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on\ncontext.\u201d Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527 (2003).\nBut here, the finality of a state-court judgment is ex\u00ad\npressly defined by statute as \u201cthe conclusion of direct\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re\u00ad\nview.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\n   With respect to postconviction relief for federal prison\u00ad\ners, this Court has held that the conclusion of direct re\u00ad\nview occurs when \u201cthis Court affirms a conviction on the\nmerits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\u201d Id., at 527, 528\u2013532 (interpreting \u00a72255,\n\u00b66(1)). We have further held that if the federal prisoner\nchooses not to seek direct review in this Court, then the\nconviction becomes final when \u201cthe time for filing a certio\u00ad\nrari petition expires.\u201d Id., at 527. In construing the simi\u00ad\nlar language of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), we see no reason to depart\nfrom this settled understanding, which comports with the\nmost natural reading of the statutory text. See Lawrence\nv. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 332\u2013335 (2007) (citing Clay,\nsupra, at 528, n. 3). As a result, direct review cannot\nconclude for purposes of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) until the \u201cavail\u00ad\nability of direct appeal to the state courts,\u201d Caspari v.\nBohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 390 (1994), and to this Court, Law\nrence, supra, at 332\u2013333, has been exhausted. Until that\ntime, the \u201cprocess of direct review\u201d has not \u201ccom[e] to an\nend\u201d and \u201ca presumption of finality and legality\u201d cannot\nyet have \u201cattache[d] to the conviction and sentence,\u201d Bare\nfoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983).\n   Under the statutory definition, therefore, once the Texas\nCourt of Criminal Appeals reopened direct review of peti\u00ad\n                    Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntioner\u2019s conviction on September 25, 2002,4 petitioner\u2019s\nconviction was no longer final for purposes of\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A). Rather, the order \u201cgranting an out-of-time\nappeal restore[d] the pendency of the direct appeal,\u201d Ex\nparte Torres, 943 S. W. 2d 469, 472 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997),\nand petitioner\u2019s conviction was again capable of modifica\u00ad\ntion through direct appeal to the state courts and to this\nCourt on certiorari review. Therefore, it was not until\nJanuary 6, 2004, when time for seeking certiorari review\nin this Court expired, that petitioner\u2019s conviction became\n\u201cfinal\u201d through \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the\nexpiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d under\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\n   Respondent objects, observing that the Court has previ\u00ad\nously acknowledged Congress\u2019 intent \u201cto advance the\nfinality of criminal convictions\u201d with the \u201ctight time line\u201d\nof \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), Mayle v. Felix, 545 U. S. 644, 662 (2005),\nwhich \u201cpinpoint[s]\u201d a uniform federal date of finality that\ndoes not \u201cvary from State to State,\u201d Clay, supra, at 530,\n531. In respondent\u2019s view, permitting a state court to\nreopen direct review, and thus reset AEDPA\u2019s 1-year\nlimitations period, undermines the policy of finality that\nCongress established in \u00a72244(d)(1). But it is the plain\nlanguage of \u00a72244(d)(1) that pinpoints the uniform date of\nfinality set by Congress. And that language points to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 We do not here decide whether petitioner could have sought timely\n\nfederal habeas relief between October 11, 1997, when the 1-year limita\u00ad\ntions period initially expired, and September 25, 2002, when the state\ncourt ordered that his direct review be reopened. Were such a petition\ntimely, though, it would not be through application of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A)\nbecause we have previously held that the possibility that a state court\nmay reopen direct review \u201cdoes not render convictions and sentences\nthat are no longer subject to direct review nonfinal,\u201d Beard v. Banks,\n542 U. S. 406, 412 (2004). We do not depart from that rule here; we\nmerely hold that, where a state court has in fact reopened direct\nreview, the conviction is rendered nonfinal for purposes of\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A) during the pendency of the reopened appeal.\n8                 JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconclusion of direct appellate proceedings in state court.\nThe statute thus carries out \u201cAEDPA\u2019s goal of promoting\n\u2018comity, finality, and federalism\u2019 by giving state courts \u2018the\nfirst opportunity to review [the] claim,\u2019 and to \u2018correct\u2019 any\n\u2018constitutional violation in the first instance.\u2019 \u201d Carey v.\nSaffold, 536 U.

The\nstatute requires a federal court, presented with an indi\u00ad\nvidual\u2019s first petition for habeas relief, to make use of the\ndate on which the entirety of the state direct appellate\nreview process was completed. Here, that date was Janu\u00ad\nary 6, 2004.\n                         *    *     *\n  Our decision today is a narrow one. We hold that,\nwhere a state court grants a criminal defendant the right\nto file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral\nreview, but before the defendant has first sought federal\nhabeas relief, his judgment is not yet \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes\nof \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). In such a case, \u201cthe date on which the\njudgment became final by the conclusion of direct review\nor the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d must\nreflect the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or\nthe expiration of the time for seeking review of that ap\u00ad\npeal. Because the Court of Appeals denied a certificate of\nappealability based on a contrary reading of the statute,\nwe reverse the judgment and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",

Argued November 4, 2008\u2014Decided January 13, 2009\nAfter petitioner\u2019s state conviction for burglary became final on October\n  11, 1996, the state appellate court held in state habeas proceedings\n  that petitioner had been denied his right to appeal and granted him\n  the right to file an out-of-time appeal. He filed the appeal, his convic\n  tion was affirmed, and his time for seeking certiorari in this Court\n  expired on January 6, 2004. Petitioner filed a second state habeas\n  application on December 6, 2004, which was denied 355 days later,\n  on June 29, 2005. He then filed a federal habeas petition on July 19,\n  2005, relying on 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) to establish its timeliness.\n  Section 2244(d)(1)(A) provides that the one-year limitations period for\n  seeking review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\n  Act of 1996 (AEDPA) begins on \u201cthe date on which the judgment be\n  came final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the\n  time for seeking such review.\u201d Petitioner argued that his judgment\n  became final on January 6, 2004, when time expired for seeking cer\n  tiorari review of the decision in his out-of-time appeal, and that his\n  July 19, 2005, petition was timely because the calculation of\n  AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitation period excludes the 355 days \u201cduring\n  which [his] properly filed application for State post-conviction . . . re\n  view . . . [was] pending,\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2). The District Court disagreed,\n  ruling that the proper start date for calculating AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limi\n  tations period under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) was October 11, 1996, when peti\n  tioner\u2019s conviction first became final. The District Court dismissed\n  the federal habeas petition as time barred. The Fifth Circuit denied\n  petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability.\n2                     JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: Where a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file\n an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral review, but before\n the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief, his judgment is\n not \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) until the conclusion of the\n out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking\n certiorari review of that appeal. This Court must enforce plain statu\n tory language according to its terms. See, e.g., Lamie v. United\n States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534. Under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A)\u2019s plain lan\n guage, once the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reopened direct re\n view of petitioner\u2019s conviction on September 25, 2002, the conviction\n was no longer final for \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) purposes. Rather, the order\n granting an out-of-time appeal restored the pendency of the direct\n appeal, and petitioner\u2019s conviction was again capable of modification\n through direct appeal to the state courts and to this Court on certio\n rari review. Therefore, it was not until January 6, 2004, when time\n for seeking certiorari review of the decision in the out-of-time appeal\n expired, that petitioner\u2019s conviction became \u201cfinal\u201d through \u201cthe con\n clusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such\n review\u201d under \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). The Court rejects respondent\u2019s argu\n ment that using the later date created by the state court\u2019s decision to\n reopen direct review, thus resetting AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitations pe\n riod, undermines the policy of finality that Congress established in\n \u00a72244(d)(1).

S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1). This case involves the date provided\nby \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), which is \u201cthe date on which the judg\u00ad\nment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the\nexpiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d Petitioner\ncontends that \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal\u201d can be postponed by a state court\u2019s decision during\ncollateral review to grant a defendant the right to file an\nout-of-time direct appeal. The District Court disagreed,\nholding instead that the date could not be moved to reflect\nthe out-of-time appeal, and that petitioner\u2019s federal ha\u00ad\nbeas petition was untimely for that reason. The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a\ncertificate of appealability. See \u00a72253(c). We now reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for\n2                    JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                 I\n   After petitioner was sentenced for burglary in 1995, his\nattorney filed an appellate brief with the Texas Court of\nAppeals pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738\n(1967), explaining that he was unable to identify any\nnonfrivolous ground on which to base an appeal.1 He left a\ncopy of the brief and a letter (advising petitioner of his\nright to file a pro se brief as set forth in Anders, id., at 744)\nat the county jail where he believed petitioner to be.\nPetitioner, however, had been transferred to a state facil\u00ad\nity and did not receive the delivery. The Texas Court of\nAppeals dismissed the appeal on September 11, 1996, and\nserved petitioner with notice of the dismissal at the\ncounty-jail address that, again, was the wrong address.\n   Petitioner eventually learned that his appeal had been\ndismissed. He filed an application in state court for a writ\nof habeas corpus pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,\nArt. 11.07 (Vernon 1977), arguing that he was denied his\nright to a meaningful appeal when he was denied the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Petitioner was indicted in August 1991 for felony burglary of a habi\u00ad\n\ntation, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a730.02 (Vernon 1989),\nenhanced by a prior felony conviction for aggravated assault with a\ndeadly weapon under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a712.42(c) (Vernon 1974).\nHe entered a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to the\nburglary and true to the enhancement in exchange for an order of\ndeferred adjudication. In November 1991, the trial court deferred\nadjudication of the burglary conviction and ordered that petitioner\nserve five years of deferred-adjudication probation. In March 1995, the\nState moved to revoke petitioner\u2019s probation based on four alleged\nviolations of the conditions of his probation. At a November 1995\nhearing, petitioner admitted to two of the violations. The court then\nheard testimony with respect to the other two violations and found that\npetitioner had committed those violations as well. The court revoked\npetitioner\u2019s deferred-adjudication probation, adjudicated him guilty\nof the enhanced burglary, and sentenced him to a 43-year term of\nimprisonment.\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

The Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals agreed and, on September 25, 2002,\ngranted petitioner the right to file an out-of-time appeal:\n     \u201c[Petitioner] is entitled to an out-of-time appeal in\n     cause number CR\u201391\u20130528\u2013B in the 119th Judicial\n     District Court of Tom Green County. [Petitioner] is\n     ordered returned to that point in time at which he\n     may give written notice of appeal so that he may then,\n     with the aid of counsel, obtain a meaningful appeal.\n     For purposes of the Texas Rules of Appellate Proce\u00ad\n     dure, all time limits shall be calculated as if the sen\u00ad\n     tence had been imposed on the date that the mandate\n     of this Court issues.\u201d Ex parte Jimenez, No. 74,433\n     (per curiam), App. 26, 27.\n   Petitioner thereafter filed the out-of-time appeal. His\nconviction was affirmed. The Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals denied discretionary review on October 8, 2003.\nTime for seeking certiorari review of that decision with\nthis Court expired on January 6, 2004. On December 6,\n2004, petitioner filed a second application for a writ of\nhabeas corpus in state court; it was denied on June 29,\n2005.\n   Petitioner then filed a federal petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus on July 19, 2005. To establish the timeli\u00ad\nness of his petition, he relied on 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A),\nwhich provides \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of\nthe time for seeking such review\u201d as the trigger for\nAEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitations period. Petitioner argued that\nhis judgment thus became final on January 6, 2004,2 when\ntime expired for seeking certiorari review of the decision\nin his out-of-time appeal. Until that date, petitioner ar\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In the District Court, petitioner contended that this date was Janu\u00ad\n\nary 8, 2004, but petitioner\u2019s time for seeking certiorari review actually\nexpired two days earlier.\n4                JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngued, direct review of his state-court conviction was not\ncomplete.\n   With January 6, 2004, as the start date, petitioner\ncontended that his July 19, 2005, petition was timely\nbecause the statute excludes from the 1-year limitations\nperiod \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed applica\u00ad\ntion for State post-conviction or other collateral review\nwith respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pend\u00ad\ning.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(2). Petitioner had a state habeas applica\u00ad\ntion pending from December 6, 2004, through June 29,\n2005, so less than one year of included time\u2014specifically,\n355 days\u2014passed between January 6, 2004, and July 19,\n2005.\n   The District Court disagreed and dismissed the federal\nhabeas petition as time barred. In the District Court\u2019s\nview, the proper start date for AEDPA\u2019s 1-year limitations\nperiod was October 11, 1996, when time for seeking discre\u00ad\ntionary review of the decision in petitioner\u2019s first direct\nappeal expired. The District Court concluded that it could\nnot take into account the Texas court\u2019s later decision\nreopening petitioner\u2019s direct appeal because Circuit prece\u00ad\ndent established that \u201c \u2018AEDPA provides for only a linear\nlimitations period, one that starts and ends on specific\ndates, with only the possibility that tolling will expand the\nperiod in between.\u2019 \u201d Order, Civ. Action No. 6:05\u2013CV\u201305\u2013C\n(ND Tex., Oct. 23, 2006), App. 75, 90 (quoting Salinas v.\nDretke, 354 F. 3d 425, 429 (CA5 2004)). Therefore, the\nDistrict Court reasoned, the limitations period began on\nOctober 11, 1996, and ended on October 11, 1997, because\npetitioner had not sought any state or federal collateral\nreview by that date.\n   The Court of Appeals denied petitioner\u2019s request for a\ncertificate of appealability, finding that he had \u201cfailed to\ndemonstrate that reasonable jurists would debate the\ncorrectness of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u00a72254\npetition is time-barred.\u201d Order, No. 06\u201311240, (May 25,\n                     Cite as: 555 U.

United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526, 534 (2004).\nIt is well established that, when the statutory language is\nplain, we must enforce it according to its terms. See, e.g.,\nDodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 359 (2005); Lamie,\nsupra, at 534; Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union\nPlanters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000); Caminetti v.\nUnited States, 242 U. S. 470, 485 (1917).\n   The parties agree that the statutory provision that\ndetermines the timeliness of petitioner\u2019s habeas petition is\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). That subsection defines the\nstarting date for purposes of the 1-year AEDPA limita\u00ad\ntions period as \u201cthe date on which the judgment became\nfinal by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of\nthe time for seeking such review.\u201d The only disputed\nquestion before us is whether the date on which direct\nreview became \u201cfinal\u201d under the statute is October 11,\n1996, when petitioner\u2019s conviction initially became final,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 We do not decide whether petitioner is entitled to a certificate of\n\nappealability on remand because we are presented solely with the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision on the timeliness of the petition under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72244(d). \u201cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on\nprocedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying consti\u00ad\ntutional claim,\u201d as here, a certificate of appealability should issue only\nwhen the prisoner shows both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it\ndebatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a\nconstitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable\nwhether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d Slack\nv. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000) (emphasis added). We make no\njudgment regarding the merits of petitioner\u2019s federal constitutional\nclaims.\n6                JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor January 6, 2004, when the out-of-time appeal granted\nby the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals became final. We\nagree with petitioner that, under the plain meaning of the\nstatutory text, the latter date controls.\n   Finality is a concept that has been \u201cvariously defined;\nlike many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on\ncontext.\u201d Clay v. United States, 537 U. S. 522, 527 (2003).\nBut here, the finality of a state-court judgment is ex\u00ad\npressly defined by statute as \u201cthe conclusion of direct\nreview or the expiration of the time for seeking such re\u00ad\nview.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\n   With respect to postconviction relief for federal prison\u00ad\ners, this Court has held that the conclusion of direct re\u00ad\nview occurs when \u201cthis Court affirms a conviction on the\nmerits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari.\u201d Id., at 527, 528\u2013532 (interpreting \u00a72255,\n\u00b66(1)). We have further held that if the federal prisoner\nchooses not to seek direct review in this Court, then the\nconviction becomes final when \u201cthe time for filing a certio\u00ad\nrari petition expires.\u201d Id., at 527. In construing the simi\u00ad\nlar language of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), we see no reason to depart\nfrom this settled understanding, which comports with the\nmost natural reading of the statutory text. See Lawrence\nv. Florida, 549 U. S. 327, 332\u2013335 (2007) (citing Clay,\nsupra, at 528, n. 3). As a result, direct review cannot\nconclude for purposes of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) until the \u201cavail\u00ad\nability of direct appeal to the state courts,\u201d Caspari v.\nBohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 390 (1994), and to this Court, Law\nrence, supra, at 332\u2013333, has been exhausted. Until that\ntime, the \u201cprocess of direct review\u201d has not \u201ccom[e] to an\nend\u201d and \u201ca presumption of finality and legality\u201d cannot\nyet have \u201cattache[d] to the conviction and sentence,\u201d Bare\nfoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983).\n   Under the statutory definition, therefore, once the Texas\nCourt of Criminal Appeals reopened direct review of peti\u00ad\n                    Cite as: 555 U.

Therefore, it was not until\nJanuary 6, 2004, when time for seeking certiorari review\nin this Court expired, that petitioner\u2019s conviction became\n\u201cfinal\u201d through \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the\nexpiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d under\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A).\n   Respondent objects, observing that the Court has previ\u00ad\nously acknowledged Congress\u2019 intent \u201cto advance the\nfinality of criminal convictions\u201d with the \u201ctight time line\u201d\nof \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), Mayle v. Felix, 545 U. S. 644, 662 (2005),\nwhich \u201cpinpoint[s]\u201d a uniform federal date of finality that\ndoes not \u201cvary from State to State,\u201d Clay, supra, at 530,\n531. In respondent\u2019s view, permitting a state court to\nreopen direct review, and thus reset AEDPA\u2019s 1-year\nlimitations period, undermines the policy of finality that\nCongress established in \u00a72244(d)(1). But it is the plain\nlanguage of \u00a72244(d)(1) that pinpoints the uniform date of\nfinality set by Congress. And that language points to the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 We do not here decide whether petitioner could have sought timely\n\nfederal habeas relief between October 11, 1997, when the 1-year limita\u00ad\ntions period initially expired, and September 25, 2002, when the state\ncourt ordered that his direct review be reopened. Were such a petition\ntimely, though, it would not be through application of \u00a72244(d)(1)(A)\nbecause we have previously held that the possibility that a state court\nmay reopen direct review \u201cdoes not render convictions and sentences\nthat are no longer subject to direct review nonfinal,\u201d Beard v. Banks,\n542 U. S. 406, 412 (2004). We do not depart from that rule here; we\nmerely hold that, where a state court has in fact reopened direct\nreview, the conviction is rendered nonfinal for purposes of\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A) during the pendency of the reopened appeal.\n8                 JIMENEZ v. QUARTERMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nconclusion of direct appellate proceedings in state court.\nThe statute thus carries out \u201cAEDPA\u2019s goal of promoting\n\u2018comity, finality, and federalism\u2019 by giving state courts \u2018the\nfirst opportunity to review [the] claim,\u2019 and to \u2018correct\u2019 any\n\u2018constitutional violation in the first instance.\u2019 \u201d Carey v.\nSaffold, 536 U. S. 214, 220 (2002) (quoting Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 420, 436 (2000); O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel,\n526 U. S. 838, 844\u2013845 (1999); citation omitted). The\nstatute requires a federal court, presented with an indi\u00ad\nvidual\u2019s first petition for habeas relief, to make use of the\ndate on which the entirety of the state direct appellate\nreview process was completed. Here, that date was Janu\u00ad\nary 6, 2004.\n                         *    *     *\n  Our decision today is a narrow one. We hold that,\nwhere a state court grants a criminal defendant the right\nto file an out-of-time direct appeal during state collateral\nreview, but before the defendant has first sought federal\nhabeas relief, his judgment is not yet \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes\nof \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). In such a case, \u201cthe date on which the\njudgment became final by the conclusion of direct review\nor the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d must\nreflect the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or\nthe expiration of the time for seeking review of that ap\u00ad\npeal. Because the Court of Appeals denied a certificate of\nappealability based on a contrary reading of the statute,\nwe reverse the judgment and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
