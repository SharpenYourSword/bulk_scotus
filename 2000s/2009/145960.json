The Court proceeds down this path even\nthough every judicial and executive body that has exam\nined petitioner’s stale claim of innocence has been unper\nsuaded, and (to make matters worst) even though it would\nbe impossible for the District Court to grant any relief.\nFar from demonstrating, as this Court’s Rule 20.4(a)\nrequires, “exceptional circumstances” that “warrant the\nexercise of the Court’s discretionary powers,” petitioner’s\nclaim is a sure loser.

I respectfully dissent.\n   Eighteen years ago, after a trial untainted by constitu\ntional defect, a unanimous jury found petitioner Troy\nAnthony Davis guilty of the murder of Mark Allen\nMacPhail.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1307637\"><a href=\"/opinion/1307637/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5–6, 426 S. E. 2d\n844, 845–846, cert. denied, 510 U. S. 950 (1993). Davis\nadmits that he was present during the beating of the\nhomeless man, but he maintains that it was one of his\ncompanions who shot Officer MacPhail. It is this claim of\n“actual innocence”—the same defense Davis raised at trial\n2                       IN RE DAVIS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbut now allegedly supported by new corroborating affida\nvits—that Davis raises as grounds for relief. And (pre\nsumably) it is this claim that the Court wants the District\nCourt to adjudicate once the petition is transferred.\n   Even if the District Court were to be persuaded by\nDavis’s affidavits, it would have no power to grant relief.\nFederal courts may order the release of convicted state\nprisoners only in accordance with the restrictions imposed\nby the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996. See Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 662 (1996).\nInsofar as it applies to the present case, that statute bars\nthe issuance of a writ of habeas corpus “with respect to\nany claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\ncourt proceedings unless the adjudication of the\nclaim . . . resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1).\n   The Georgia Supreme Court rejected petitioner’s “ac\ntual-innocence” claim on the merits, denying his extraor\ndinary motion for a new trial. Davis can obtain relief only\nif that determination was contrary to, or an unreasonable\napplication of, “clearly established Federal law, as deter\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” It\nmost assuredly was not. This Court has never held that\nthe Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted de\nfendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able\nto convince a habeas court that he is “actually” innocent.\nQuite to the contrary, we have repeatedly left that ques\ntion unresolved, while expressing considerable doubt that\nany claim based on alleged “actual innocence” is constitu\ntionally cognizable. See Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390,\n400–401, 416–417 (1993); see also House v. Bell, 547 U. S.\n518, 555 (2006); District Attorney’s Office for Third Judi\ncial Dist. v. Osborne, ante, at 18. A state court cannot\npossibly have contravened, or even unreasonably applied,\n                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n“clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States,” by rejecting a type\nof claim that the Supreme Court has not once accepted as\nvalid.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS says that we need not be deterred by\nthe limitations that Congress has placed on federal courts’\nauthority to issue the writ, because we cannot rule out the\npossibility that the District Court might find those limita\ntions unconstitutional as applied to actual-innocence\nclaims. Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). (This is not a\npossibility that Davis has raised, but one that JUSTICE\nSTEVENS has imagined.) But acknowledging that possibil\nity would make a nullity of §2254(d)(1). There is no sound\nbasis for distinguishing an actual-innocence claim from\nany other claim that is alleged to have produced a wrong\nful conviction. If the District Court here can ignore\n§2254(d)(1) on the theory that otherwise Davis’s actual\ninnocence claim would (unconstitutionally) go unad\ndressed, the same possibility would exist for any claim\ngoing beyond “clearly established Federal law.”\n   The existence of that possibility is incompatible with the\nmany cases in which we have reversed lower courts for\ntheir failure to apply §2254(d)(1), with no consideration of\nconstitutional entitlement. See, e.g., Knowles v. Mir\nzayance, 556 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op., at 9–10); Wright\nv. Van Patten, 552 U. S. 120, __ (2008) (slip op., at 5–6)\n(per curiam); Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76–77\n(2006). We have done so because the argument that the\nConstitution requires federal-court screening of all state\nconvictions for constitutional violations is frivolous. For\nmuch of our history, federal habeas review was not avail\nable even for those state convictions claimed to be in viola\ntion of clearly established federal law. See Stone v. Pow\nell, 428 U. S. 465, 474–476 (1976); Bator, Finality in\nCriminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Pris\noners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 465–466 (1963); L. Yackle,\n4                            IN RE DAVIS\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nPostconviction Remedies §19 (1981). It seems to me im\nproper to grant the extraordinary relief of habeas corpus\non the possibility that we have approved—indeed, di\nrected—the disregard of constitutional imperatives in the\npast. If we have new-found doubts regarding the constitu\ntionality of §2254(d)(1), we should hear Davis’s application\nand resolve that question (if necessary) ourselves.*\n   Transferring this case to a court that has no power to\ngrant relief is strange enough. It becomes stranger still\nwhen one realizes that the allegedly new evidence we\nshunt off to be examined by the District Court has already\nbeen considered (and rejected) multiple times. Davis’s\npostconviction “actual-innocence” claim is not new. Most\nof the evidence on which it is based is almost a decade old.\nA State Supreme Court, a State Board of Pardons and\nParoles, and a Federal Court of Appeals have all consid\nered the evidence Davis now presents and found it lacking.\n(I do not rely upon the similar conclusion of the Georgia\ntrial court, since unlike the others that court relied sub\nstantially upon Georgia evidentiary rules rather than the\nunpersuasiveness of the evidence Davis brought forward.\nSee App. to Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus 57a–63a.)\n   The Georgia Supreme Court “look[ed] beyond bare legal\nprinciples that might otherwise be controlling to the core\nquestion of whether a jury presented with Davis’s alleg\nedly-new testimony would probably find him not guilty or\ngive him a sentence other than death.” Davis v.
