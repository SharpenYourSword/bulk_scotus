The Court proceeds down this path even\nthough every judicial and executive body that has exam\nined petitioner\u2019s stale claim of innocence has been unper\nsuaded, and (to make matters worst) even though it would\nbe impossible for the District Court to grant any relief.\nFar from demonstrating, as this Court\u2019s Rule 20.4(a)\nrequires, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that \u201cwarrant the\nexercise of the Court\u2019s discretionary powers,\u201d petitioner\u2019s\nclaim is a sure loser. Transferring his petition to the\nDistrict Court is a confusing exercise that can serve no\npurpose except to delay the State\u2019s execution of its lawful\ncriminal judgment. I respectfully dissent.\n   Eighteen years ago, after a trial untainted by constitu\ntional defect, a unanimous jury found petitioner Troy\nAnthony Davis guilty of the murder of Mark Allen\nMacPhail. The evidence showed that MacPhail, an off\nduty police officer, was shot multiple times after respond\ning to the beating of a homeless man in a restaurant\nparking lot. Davis v. State, 263 Ga. 5, 5\u20136, 426 S. E. 2d\n844, 845\u2013846, cert. denied, 510 U. S. 950 (1993). Davis\nadmits that he was present during the beating of the\nhomeless man, but he maintains that it was one of his\ncompanions who shot Officer MacPhail. It is this claim of\n\u201cactual innocence\u201d\u2014the same defense Davis raised at trial\n2                       IN RE DAVIS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbut now allegedly supported by new corroborating affida\nvits\u2014that Davis raises as grounds for relief. And (pre\nsumably) it is this claim that the Court wants the District\nCourt to adjudicate once the petition is transferred.\n   Even if the District Court were to be persuaded by\nDavis\u2019s affidavits, it would have no power to grant relief.\nFederal courts may order the release of convicted state\nprisoners only in accordance with the restrictions imposed\nby the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996. See Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S. 651, 662 (1996).\nInsofar as it applies to the present case, that statute bars\nthe issuance of a writ of habeas corpus \u201cwith respect to\nany claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State\ncourt proceedings unless the adjudication of the\nclaim . . . resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   The Georgia Supreme Court rejected petitioner\u2019s \u201cac\ntual-innocence\u201d claim on the merits, denying his extraor\ndinary motion for a new trial. Davis can obtain relief only\nif that determination was contrary to, or an unreasonable\napplication of, \u201cclearly established Federal law, as deter\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d It\nmost assuredly was not. This Court has never held that\nthe Constitution forbids the execution of a convicted de\nfendant who has had a full and fair trial but is later able\nto convince a habeas court that he is \u201cactually\u201d innocent.\nQuite to the contrary, we have repeatedly left that ques\ntion unresolved, while expressing considerable doubt that\nany claim based on alleged \u201cactual innocence\u201d is constitu\ntionally cognizable. See Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390,\n400\u2013401, 416\u2013417 (1993); see also House v. Bell, 547 U. S.\n518, 555 (2006); District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judi\ncial Dist. v.

Ante, at 2 (concurring opinion). (This is not a\npossibility that Davis has raised, but one that JUSTICE\nSTEVENS has imagined.) But acknowledging that possibil\nity would make a nullity of \u00a72254(d)(1). There is no sound\nbasis for distinguishing an actual-innocence claim from\nany other claim that is alleged to have produced a wrong\nful conviction. If the District Court here can ignore\n\u00a72254(d)(1) on the theory that otherwise Davis\u2019s actual\ninnocence claim would (unconstitutionally) go unad\ndressed, the same possibility would exist for any claim\ngoing beyond \u201cclearly established Federal law.\u201d\n   The existence of that possibility is incompatible with the\nmany cases in which we have reversed lower courts for\ntheir failure to apply \u00a72254(d)(1), with no consideration of\nconstitutional entitlement. See, e.g., Knowles v. Mir\nzayance, 556 U. S. __, __ (2009) (slip op., at 9\u201310); Wright\nv. Van Patten, 552 U. S. 120, __ (2008) (slip op., at 5\u20136)\n(per curiam); Carey v. Musladin, 549 U. S. 70, 76\u201377\n(2006). We have done so because the argument that the\nConstitution requires federal-court screening of all state\nconvictions for constitutional violations is frivolous. For\nmuch of our history, federal habeas review was not avail\nable even for those state convictions claimed to be in viola\ntion of clearly established federal law. See Stone v. Pow\nell, 428 U. S. 465, 474\u2013476 (1976); Bator, Finality in\nCriminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Pris\noners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 465\u2013466 (1963); L.

It seems to me im\nproper to grant the extraordinary relief of habeas corpus\non the possibility that we have approved\u2014indeed, di\nrected\u2014the disregard of constitutional imperatives in the\npast. If we have new-found doubts regarding the constitu\ntionality of \u00a72254(d)(1), we should hear Davis\u2019s application\nand resolve that question (if necessary) ourselves.*\n   Transferring this case to a court that has no power to\ngrant relief is strange enough. It becomes stranger still\nwhen one realizes that the allegedly new evidence we\nshunt off to be examined by the District Court has already\nbeen considered (and rejected) multiple times. Davis\u2019s\npostconviction \u201cactual-innocence\u201d claim is not new. Most\nof the evidence on which it is based is almost a decade old.\nA State Supreme Court, a State Board of Pardons and\nParoles, and a Federal Court of Appeals have all consid\nered the evidence Davis now presents and found it lacking.\n(I do not rely upon the similar conclusion of the Georgia\ntrial court, since unlike the others that court relied sub\nstantially upon Georgia evidentiary rules rather than the\nunpersuasiveness of the evidence Davis brought forward.\nSee App. to Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus 57a\u201363a.)\n   The Georgia Supreme Court \u201clook[ed] beyond bare legal\nprinciples that might otherwise be controlling to the core\nquestion of whether a jury presented with Davis\u2019s alleg\nedly-new testimony would probably find him not guilty or\ngive him a sentence other than death.\u201d Davis v.

That court\nis directed to consider evidence of actual innocence which\nhas been reviewed and rejected at least three times, and\nwhich, even if adequate to persuade the District Court,\ncannot (as far as anyone knows) form the basis for any\nrelief. I truly do not see how the District Court can dis\ncern what is expected of it. If this Court thinks it possible\nthat capital convictions obtained in full compliance with\nlaw can never be final, but are always subject to being set\n6                       IN RE DAVIS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\naside by federal courts for the reason of \u201cactual innocence,\u201d\nit should set this case on our own docket so that we can (if\nnecessary) resolve that question. Sending it to a district\ncourt that \u201cmight\u201d be authorized to provide relief, but then\nagain \u201cmight\u201d be reversed if it did so, is not a sensible way\nto proceed.\n</pre>",
