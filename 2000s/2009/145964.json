MARKETING GROUP, INC., PETITIONER\n        v. BG STAR PRODUCTIONS, INC., ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 08\u2013463.   Decided March 23, 2009 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE\nBREYER joins, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n   The object of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code is to\nempower a debtor with going concern value to reorganize\nits operations to become solvent once more. In a typical\ncase, the debtor takes on the role of \u201cdebtor in possession,\u201d\n11 U. S. C. \u00a71101(1), allowing it to retain possession and\ncontrol of its business. A debtor-in-possession operates its\nbusiness and performs many functions that would fall to\nthe trustee under other chapters of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\u00a71107(a).\n   At issue in this petition is the power of a debtor-in\npossession to assume executory contracts held by the\ndebtor before bankruptcy. \u00a7365(a). Section 365 gives the\ndebtor-in-possession the power to assume\u2014that is, to\ncontinue to receive the benefits of, while also continuing to\nperform its obligations under\u2014the debtor\u2019s leases, ongoing\nperformance contracts, and licenses to use the property of\nothers. This power is withdrawn, however, if\n    \u201capplicable law excuses a party, other than the debtor,\n    to [an executory contract] from accepting performance\n    from or rendering performance to an entity other than\n    the debtor or the debtor in possession, whether or not\n    such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assign\n    ment of rights or delegation of duties; and . . . such\n    party does not consent to such assumption or assign\n    ment . . .\u201d \u00a7\u00a7365(c)(1)(A)\u2013(B).\n2        N. C. P. MARKETING GROUP, INC. v. BG STAR\n                     PRODUCTIONS, INC.                         \n\n                    Statement of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nAccording to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,\nthis language means that a debtor-in-possession may\nassume an executory contract only if hypothetically it\nmight assign that contract to a third party. That is to say,\nif the debtor-in-possession lacks hypothetical authority to\nassign a contract, then it may not assume it\u2014even if the\ndebtor-in-possession has no actual intention of assigning\nthe contract to another. In re Catapult Entertainment,\nInc., 165 F. 3d 747 (CA9 1999). The so-called \u201chypotheti\ncal test\u201d is preferred by a majority of the other Courts of\nAppeals that have addressed this question. See In re\nSunterra Corp., 361 F. 3d 257 (CA4 2004); In re James\nCable Partners, L. P., 27 F. 3d 534 (CA11 1994) (per cu\nriam); In re West Electronics, Inc., 852 F. 2d 79 (CA3\n1988).\n   The hypothetical test is not, however, without its de\ntractors. One arguable criticism of the hypothetical ap\nproach is that it purchases fidelity to the Bankruptcy\nCode\u2019s text by sacrificing sound bankruptcy policy. For\none thing, the hypothetical test may prevent debtors-in\npossession from continuing to exercise their rights under\nnonassignable contracts, such as patent and copyright\nlicenses.    Without these contracts, some debtors-in\npossession may be unable to effect the successful reorgani\nzation that Chapter 11 was designed to promote. For\nanother thing, the hypothetical test provides a windfall to\nnondebtor parties to valuable executory contracts: If the\ndebtor is outside of bankruptcy, then the nondebtor does\nnot have the option to renege on its agreement; but if the\ndebtor seeks bankruptcy protection, then the nondebtor\nobtains the power to reclaim\u2014and resell at the prevailing,\npotentially higher market rate\u2014the rights it sold to the\ndebtor.\n   To prevent \u00a7365(c) from engendering unwise policy, one\nCourt of Appeals, and a number of Bankruptcy Courts,\nreject the hypothetical test in favor of an \u201cactual test,\u201d\n                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   Statement of KENNEDY, J.\n\nunder which a Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession may as\nsume an executory contract provided it has no actual\nintent to assign the contract to a third party. See Institut\nPasteur v. Cambridge Biotech Corp., 104 F. 3d 489, 493\n(CA1 1997) (applying the actual test); In re Catapult, 165\nF. 3d, at 749, n. 2 (collecting Bankruptcy Court decisions\nfavoring the actual test). Of course, the actual test may\npresent problems of its own. It may be argued, for in\nstance, that the actual test aligns \u00a7365(c) with sound\nbankruptcy policy only at the cost of departing from at\nleast one interpretation of the plain text of the law. See\nid., at 751\u2013755.\n   The division in the courts over the meaning of \u00a7365(c)(1)\nis an important one to resolve for Bankruptcy Courts and\nfor businesses that seek reorganization. This petition for\ncertiorari, however, is not the most suitable case for our\nresolution of the conflict. Addressing the issue here might\nfirst require us to resolve issues that may turn on the\ncorrect interpretation of antecedent questions under state\nlaw and trademark-protection principles. For those and\nother reasons, I reluctantly agree with the Court\u2019s decision\nto deny certiorari. In a different case the Court should\nconsider granting certiorari on this significant question.\n",
