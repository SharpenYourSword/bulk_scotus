Decided March 9, 2009\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   This petition asks us to determine whether the Eighth\nAmendment’s prohibition on “cruel and unusual punish\nments” precludes the execution of a prisoner who has\nspent over 30 years on death row. JUSTICE STEVENS and I\nhave previously written that this is a question that merits\nthe Court’s attention, see, e.g., Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S.\n1045 (1995) (STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari);\nFoster v. Florida, 537 U. S. 990 (1999) (BREYER, J., dis\nsenting from denial of certiorari); Knight v. Florida, 528\nU. S. 990, 993 (1999) (same), and the delay here is even\nlonger than the delay in those prior cases. Here, peti\ntioner has been on death row for 32 years, well over half\nhis life. For the reasons we have set forth in the past and\nfor many of those added in JUSTICE STEVENS’ separate\nstatement, I would grant this petition.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that petitioner cannot now\nchallenge the constitutionality of the delay because much\nof that delay is his own fault—he caused it by choosing to\nchallenge the sentence that the people of Florida deemed\nappropriate. See ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in denial of\ncertiorari). I do not believe that petitioner’s decision to\nexercise his right to seek appellate review of his death\nsentence automatically waives a claim that the Eighth\nAmendment proscribes a delay of more than 30 years. See\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 198 (1976) (joint opinion\nof Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.) (automatic appeal of\n2                  THOMPSON v. MCNEIL\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nall death sentences is “an important additional safeguard\nagainst arbitrariness and caprice”). But in any event the\ndelay here resulted in significant part from constitution\nally defective death penalty procedures for which peti\ntioner was not responsible. See Knight, supra, at 993.\n   In particular, the delay was partly caused by the sen\ntencing judge’s failure to allow the presentation and jury\nconsideration of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances,\nan approach which we have unanimously held constitu\ntionally forbidden, see Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S. 393,\n398–399 (1987). As a result of this error, the Florida\nSupreme Court remanded for resentencing. See Thomp\nson v.

Peti\ntioner, for example, introduced an affidavit of Barbara\nGarritz, who witnessed the crime for which petitioner was\nsentenced to death.         She described petitioner’s co\ndefendant Rocky Surace as “an evil man” and “the devil,\nhimself” and explained that he “manipulate[d] people . . .\n[into] follow[ing] his orders.” Tr. 2473 (May 31, 1989). By\ncontrast, she described petitioner as “a big, easy-going\nchild who would do just about anything to please” and who\n“never seemed to have an idea of his own.” Id., at 2474;\nsee also ibid. (“He would do just about anything he was\ntold”). She described the relationship between petitioner\nand Rocky as follows: “Bill was completely under Rocky’s\nspell. He hung on every word Rocky said and would do\nand say everything Rocky did and said. He was like\nRocky’s dog. Rocky would give an order and Bill would do\nit, no questions asked.” Id., at 2475. With respect to the\nnight in question, she explained that, “Everything Bill did,\nhe did at Rocky’s direction, just like he always did when I\nwas around the two. I saw what happened and I know\n                   Cite as: 556 U.

For example, one of\npetitioner’s teachers testified that while in elementary\nschool petitioner consistently scored in the mid-70’s on IQ\ntests; those scores qualified him for classes for the educa\nble mentally retarded. Id., at 2178 (May 30, 1989). His\nteachers also described him as “slow,” a “follower” who\nwas “always . . . eager to please.” Id., at 2185, 2186, 2185;\nsee also id., at 2191–2192. A psychologist and a psychia\ntrist who examined him both described him as showing\nsigns of brain damage, id., at 2510, 2513, 2516, 2523 (June\n1, 1989); see also id., at 2570–2571, 2577, and a psychia\ntrist testified that “the kind of disorder [petitioner] has,\nhe’s easily led and felt very threatened by the co\ndefendant,” id., at 2564; see also id., at 2602 (“There is no\ndoubt in the world that this man basically appeared to be\na rather—rather dependent person who tends to follow the\nleader. He is not a leader himself. So, whatever Mr.\nSurace says, he probably goes along with it”). After hear\ning this evidence, the jury recommended a death sentence\nby a vote of 7 to 5.\n   I refer to the evidence only to point out that it is fair, not\nunfair, to take account of the delay the State caused when\nit initially refused to allow Thompson to present it at the\npunishment phase of his trial. I would add that it is the\npunishment, not the gruesome nature of the crime, which\nis at issue. Reasonable jurors might, and did, disagree\nabout the appropriateness of executing Thompson for his\nrole in that crime. The question here, however, is whether\nthe Constitution permits that execution after a delay of 32\nyears—a delay for which the State was in significant part\nresponsible.\n   I believe we should grant the writ to consider that ques\ntion.\n</pre>", "id": 145965, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/03/09/Thompson_v._McNeil.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 556 U.
