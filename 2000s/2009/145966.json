Flor\nida, 528 U. S. 990 (1999) (THOMAS, J., concurring in denial\nof certiorari). Petitioner William Lee Thompson has\npleaded guilty to this murder\u2014twice. Thompson v.

Florida, 537 U. S. 990, 991 (2002) (THOMAS, J., concur\nring in denial of certiorari). But because petitioner chose\nto challenge his death sentence, JUSTICE STEVENS and\nJUSTICE BREYER suggest that the subsequent delay\ncaused by petitioner\u2019s 32 years of litigation creates an\nEighth Amendment problem.

See post, at 1. But framing the issue in\nthis way obscures the central question. The issue is not\nwhether a death-row inmate\u2019s appeals \u201cwaive\u201d any Eighth\nAmendment right; the issue instead is whether the death\nrow inmate\u2019s litigation strategy, which delays his execu\ntion, provides a justification for the Court to invent a new\nEighth Amendment right. It does not. See Knight, supra,\nat 992 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (\u201cConsistency would seem\nto demand that those who accept our death penalty juris\nprudence as a given also accept the lengthy delay between\nsentencing and execution as a necessary consequence. . . .\nIt is incongruous to arm capital defendants with an arse\nnal of \u2018constitutional\u2019 claims with which they may delay\ntheir executions, and simultaneously to complain when\nexecutions are inevitably delayed\u201d).\n   I also disagree with JUSTICE STEVENS that other aspects\nof the criminal justice system in this country require the\nfresh examination of the costs and benefits of retaining\nthe death penalty that he seeks. Ante, at 2\u20133. For exam\nple, JUSTICE STEVENS criticizes the \u201cdehumanizing effects\u201d\nof the manner in which petitioner has been confined, ante,\nat 2, but he never pauses to consider whether there is a\nlegitimate penological reason for keeping certain inmates\nin restrictive confinement. See, e.g., Kocieniewski, Death\nRow Inmate Said to Beat and Kick Another to Death in\nNew Jersey Prison, New York Times, Sept. 8, 1999, p. B5.\nIndeed, the disastrous consequences of this Court\u2019s recent\nforay into prison management, Johnson v. California, 543\nU. S. 499 (2005), should have suppressed any urge to\nsecond-guess these difficult institutional decisions, Beard\nv. Banks, 548 U. S. 521, 536\u2013537 (2006) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (noting that after the Court in\n                  Cite as: 556 U.

Ante, at 3.\nThese inmates may have been freed from prison, but that\ndoes not necessarily mean that they were declared inno\ncent of the crime for which they were convicted. Kansas v.\nMarsh, 548 U.

Moreover, by citing these statistics, JUSTICE\nSTEVENS implies \u201cthat the death penalty can only be just\nin a system that does not permit error.\u201d Marsh, 548 U. S.,\nat 181. But no criminal justice system operates without\nerror. There is no constitutional basis for prohibiting\nFlorida \u201cfrom authorizing the death penalty, even in our\nimperfect system.\u201d Ibid.\n  Finally, JUSTICE STEVENS altogether refuses to take into\nconsideration the gruesome nature of the crimes that\nlegitimately lead States to authorize the death penalty\nand juries to impose it. The facts of this case illustrate the\npoint. On March 30, 1976, petitioner and his codefendant\nwere in a motel room with the victim and another woman.\nThey instructed the women to contact their families to\nobtain money. The victim made the mistake of promising\nthat she could obtain $200 to $300; she was able to secure\nonly $25. Enraged, petitioner\u2019s codefendant ordered her\ninto the bedroom, removed his chain belt, forced her to\nundress, and began hitting her in the face while petitioner\nbeat her with the belt.

All the while,\nthey continued to beat her with the chain belt, the club,\nand the chair leg. They stopped the attack once to force\nthe victim to again call her mother to ask for money. After\nthe call, petitioner and his codefendant resumed the tor\nture until the victim died. Thompson, 759 So. 2d, at 653\u2013\n654.*\n   Three juries recommended that petitioner receive the\ndeath penalty for this heinous murder, and petitioner has\nreceived judicial review of his sentence on at least 17\noccasions. The decision to sentence petitioner to death is\nnot \u201c \u2018the product of habit and inattention rather than an\nacceptable deliberative process.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 4 (quoting and\nciting Baze v.

It represents\nthe considered judgment of the people of Florida that a\ndeath sentence, which is expressly contemplated by the\nConstitution, see Amdts. 5, 14, is warranted in this case.\nIt is the crime\u2014and not the punishment imposed by the\njury or the delay in petitioner\u2019s execution\u2014that was \u201cun\nacceptably cruel.\u201d Ante, at 4.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * JUSTICE BREYER suggests that petitioner \u201cmay be significantly less\nculpable than his codefendant, who did not receive the death penalty\u201d\nprincipally because Barbara Garritz, the woman who witnessed the\nmurder, averred at petitioner\u2019s third sentencing that he was dominated\nby his codefendant.
