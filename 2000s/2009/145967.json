WALTER A. MCNEIL,\n\n     SECRETARY, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF\n\n                CORRECTIONS\n\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES\n     COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n              No. 08\u20137369. Decided March 9, 2009\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS respecting the denial of\nthe petition for writ of certiorari.\n   Last Term, in my opinion in Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. ___\n(2008), I suggested that the \u201ctime for a dispassionate,\nimpartial comparison of the enormous costs that death\npenalty litigation imposes on society with the benefits that\nit produces has surely arrived.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12)\n(opinion concurring in judgment). This petition for certio\nrari describes costs that merit consideration in any such\nstudy.\n   In June 1976, having been advised by counsel that he\nwould not receive the death penalty if he accepted respon\nsibility for his crime, petitioner pleaded guilty to a capital\noffense. The advice was erroneous, and he was sentenced\nto death. Since that time, two state-court judgments have\nset aside his death sentence. See Thompson v. State, 351\nSo. 2d 701 (Fla. 1977); Thompson v. Dugger, 515 So. 2d\n173 (Fla. 1987). At a third penalty hearing\u2014after peti\ntioner presented mitigation evidence about his limited\nmental capacity and dysfunctional childhood that had\npreviously been barred\u2014five members of the advisory jury\nvoted against a death sentence, but the court again im\nposed a sentence of death.\n   Thirty-two years have passed since petitioner was first\nsentenced to death. In prior cases, both JUSTICE BREYER\nand I have noted that substantially delayed executions\narguably violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition\n2                  THOMPSON v. MCNEIL\n\n                   Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment. See, e.g., Smith v.\nArizona, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (BREYER, J., dissenting\nfrom denial of certiorari); Foster v. Florida, 537 U. S. 990,\n991 (2002) (same); Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990, 993\n(1999) (same); Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995)\n(STEVENS, J., respecting denial of certiorari). Petitioner\u2019s\ncase involves a longer delay than any of those earlier\ncases.\n   As he awaits execution, petitioner has endured espe\ncially severe conditions of confinement, spending up to 23\nhours per day in isolation in a 6- by 9-foot cell. Two death\nwarrants have been signed against him and stayed only\nshortly before he was scheduled to be put to death. The\ndehumanizing effects of such treatment are undeniable.\nSee People v. Anderson, 6 Cal. 3d 628, 649, 493 P. 2d 880,\n894 (1972) (\u201c[T]he process of carrying out a verdict of\ndeath is often so degrading and brutalizing to the human\nspirit as to constitute psychological torture\u201d); Furman v.\nGeorgia, 408 U. S. 238, 288 (1972) (Brennan, J., concur\nring) (\u201c[T]he prospect of pending execution exacts a fright\nful toll during the inevitable long wait between the impo\nsition of sentence and the actual infliction of death\u201d).\nMoreover, as I explained in Lackey, delaying an execution\ndoes not further public purposes of retribution and deter\nrence but only diminishes whatever possible benefit soci\nety might receive from petitioner\u2019s death. It would there\nfore be appropriate to conclude that a punishment of death\nafter significant delay is \u201cso totally without penological\njustification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of\nsuffering.\u201d Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 183 (1976)\n(joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).\n   While the length of petitioner\u2019s confinement under\nsentence of death is extraordinary, the concerns his case\nraises are not unique. Clarence Allen Lackey had spent\n17 years on death row when this Court reviewed his peti\ntion for certiorari. Today, condemned inmates await\n                     Cite as: 556 U.

To my mind, this figure underscores\nthe fundamental inhumanity and unworkability of the\ndeath penalty as it is administered in the United States.\n   Some respond that delays in carrying out executions are\nthe result of this Court\u2019s insistence on excessive process.\nBut delays have multiple causes, including \u201cthe States\u2019\nfailure to apply constitutionally sufficient procedures at\nthe time of initial [conviction or] sentencing.\u201d Knight, 528\nU. S., at 998 (BREYER, J., dissenting from denial of certio\nrari). The reversible error rate in capital trials is stagger\ning. More than 30 percent of death verdicts imposed\nbetween 1973 and 2000 have been overturned,1 and 129\ninmates sentenced to death during that time have been\nexonerated, often more than a decade after they were\nconvicted.2 Judicial process takes time, but the error rate\nin capital cases illustrates its necessity. We are duty\nbound to \u201cinsure that every safeguard is observed\u201d when\n\u201ca defendant\u2019s life is at stake.\u201d Gregg, 428 U. S., at 187\n(joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and STEVENS, JJ.).\n   In sum, our experience during the past three decades\nhas demonstrated that delays in state-sponsored killings\nare inescapable and that executing defendants after such\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Capital Pun\n\nishment, 2005, p. 14 (Dec. 2006) (App. Table 12), http:/www.ojp.usdoj.\ngov/bjs/pub/pdf/cp05.pdf.

This inevitable cruelty,\ncoupled with the diminished justification for carrying out\nan execution after the lapse of so much time, reinforces my\nopinion that contemporary decisions \u201cto retain the death\npenalty as a part of our law are the product of habit and\ninattention rather than an acceptable deliberative proc\ness.\u201d Baze, 553 U.
