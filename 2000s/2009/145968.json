UNITED STATES \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 08\u2013410.   Decided February 23, 2009 \n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n  In McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987), this\nCourt held that while \u201c[t]he mail fraud statute clearly\nprotects property rights, . . . [it] does not refer to the in\ntangible right of the citizenry to good government.\u201d Id., at\n356. That holding invalidated the theory that official\ncorruption and misconduct, by depriving citizens of their\n\u201cintangible right\u201d to the honest and impartial services of\ngovernment, constituted fraud. Although all of the Fed\neral Courts of Appeals had accepted the theory, see id., at\n364 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), we declined to \u201cconstrue the\nstatute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries am\nbiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting\nstandards of disclosure and good government for local and\nstate officials.\u201d Id., at 360 (majority opinion). \u201cIf Congress\ndesires to go further,\u201d we said, \u201cit must speak more clearly\nthan it has.\u201d Ibid.\n  Congress spoke shortly thereafter. \u201cFor the purposes of\nthis chapter, the term \u2018scheme or artifice to defraud\u2019 in\ncludes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intan\ngible right of honest services.\u201d          18 U. S. C. \u00a71346.\nWhether that terse amendment qualifies as speaking\n\u201cmore clearly\u201d or in any way lessens the vagueness and\nfederalism concerns that produced this Court\u2019s decision in\nMcNally is another matter.\n  Though it consists of only 28 words, the statute has been\n2                SORICH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ninvoked to impose criminal penalties upon a staggeringly\nbroad swath of behavior, including misconduct not only by\npublic officials and employees but also by private employ\nees and corporate fiduciaries. Courts have upheld convic\ntions of a local housing official who failed to disclose a\nconflict of interest, United States v. Hasner, 340 F. 3d\n1261, 1271 (CA11 2003) (per curiam); a businessman who\nattempted to pay a state legislator to exercise \u201cinformal\nand behind-the-scenes influence on legislation,\u201d United\nStates v. Potter, 463 F. 3d 9, 18 (CA1 2006); students who\nschemed with their professors to turn in plagiarized work,\nUnited States v. Frost, 125 F. 3d 346, 369 (CA6 1997);\nlawyers who made side-payments to insurance adjusters\nin exchange for the expedited processing of their clients\u2019\npending claims, United States v. Rybicki, 354 F. 3d 124,\n142 (CA2 2003) (en banc); and, in the decision we are\nasked to review here, city employees who engaged in\npolitical-patronage hiring for local civil-service jobs, 523\nF. 3d 702, 705 (CA7 2008).\n   If the \u201chonest services\u201d theory\u2014broadly stated, that\nofficeholders and employees owe a duty to act only in the\nbest interests of their constituents and employers\u2014is\ntaken seriously and carried to its logical conclusion, pre\nsumably the statute also renders criminal a state legisla\ntor\u2019s decision to vote for a bill because he expects it will\ncurry favor with a small minority essential to his reelec\ntion; a mayor\u2019s attempt to use the prestige of his office to\nobtain a restaurant table without a reservation; a public\nemployee\u2019s recommendation of his incompetent friend for a\npublic contract; and any self-dealing by a corporate officer.\nIndeed, it would seemingly cover a salaried employee\u2019s\nphoning in sick to go to a ball game. In many cases, more\nover, the maximum penalty for violating this statute will\nbe added to the maximum penalty for violating 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7666, a federal bribery statute, since violation of the latter\nrequires the additional factor of the employer\u2019s receipt of\n                  Cite as: 555 U.

Quite a potent federal prosecutorial tool.\n   To avoid some of these extreme results, the Courts of\nAppeals have spent two decades attempting to cabin the\nbreadth of \u00a71346 through a variety of limiting principles.\nNo consensus has emerged. The Fifth Circuit has held\nthat the statute criminalizes only a deprivation of services\nthat is unlawful under state law, United States v. Brum\nley, 116 F. 3d 728, 735 (1997) (en banc), but other courts\nhave not agreed, see United States v. Martin, 195 F. 3d\n961, 966 (CA7 1999) (Brumley \u201cis contrary to the law in\nthis circuit . . . and in the other circuits to have addressed\nthe question\u201d). The Seventh Circuit has construed the\nstatute to prohibit only the abuse of position \u201cfor private\ngain,\u201d United States v. Bloom, 149 F. 3d 649, 655 (1998),\nbut other Circuits maintain that gain is not an element of\nthe crime at all, e.g., United States v. Panarella, 277 F. 3d\n678, 692 (CA3 2002). Courts have expressed frustration at\nthe lack of any \u201csimple formula specific enough to give\nclear cut answers to borderline problems.\u201d United States\nv. Urciuoli, 513 F. 3d 290, 300 (CA1 2008).\n   It is practically gospel in the lower courts that the stat\nute \u201cdoes not encompass every instance of official miscon\nduct,\u201d United States v. Sawyer, 85 F. 3d 713, 725 (CA1\n1996). The Tenth Circuit has confidently proclaimed that\nthe statute is \u201cnot violated by every breach of contract,\nbreach of duty, conflict of interest, or misstatement made\nin the course of dealing,\u201d United States v. Welch, 327 F. 3d\n1081, 1107 (CA10 2003). But why that is so, and what\nprinciple it is that separates the criminal breaches, con\nflicts and misstatements from the obnoxious but lawful\nones, remains entirely unspecified. Without some coher\nent limiting principle to define what \u201cthe intangible right\nof honest services\u201d is, whence it derives, and how it is\nviolated, this expansive phrase invites abuse by headline\n4                SORICH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ngrabbing prosecutors in pursuit of local officials, state\nlegislators, and corporate CEOs who engage in any man\nner of unappealing or ethically questionable conduct.\n  In the background of the interpretive venture remain\nthe two concerns voiced by this Court in McNally. First,\nthe prospect of federal prosecutors\u2019 (or federal courts\u2019)\ncreating ethics codes and setting disclosure requirements\nfor local and state officials. Is it the role of the Federal\nGovernment to define the fiduciary duties that a town\nalderman or school board trustee owes to his constituents?\nIt is one thing to enact and enforce clear rules against\ncertain types of corrupt behavior, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a7666(a)\n(bribes and gratuities to public officials), but quite another\nto mandate a freestanding, open-ended duty to provide\n\u201chonest services\u201d\u2014with the details to be worked out case\nby-case. See generally Brown, Should Federalism Shield\nCorruption?\u2014Mail Fraud, State Law and Post-Lopez\nAnalysis, 82 Cornell L. Rev. 225 (1997).\n  Second and relatedly, this Court has long recognized the\n\u201cbasic principle that a criminal statute must give fair\nwarning of the conduct that it makes a crime.\u201d Bouie v.\nCity of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 350 (1964). There is a\nserious argument that \u00a71346 is nothing more than an\ninvitation for federal courts to develop a common-law\ncrime of unethical conduct. But \u201cthe notion of a common\nlaw crime is utterly anathema today,\u201d Rogers v. Tennessee,\n532 U. S. 451, 476 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and for\ngood reason. It is simply not fair to prosecute someone for\na crime that has not been defined until the judicial deci\nsion that sends him to jail. \u201cHow can the public be ex\npected to know what the statute means when the judges\nand prosecutors themselves do not know, or must make it\nup as they go along?\u201d Rybicki, supra, at 160 (Jacobs, J.,\ndissenting).\n  The present case in which certiorari is sought implicates\ntwo of the limiting principles that the Courts of Appeals\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhave debated\u2014whether the crime of deprivation of \u201chonest\nservices\u201d requires a predicate violation of state law, and\nwhether it requires the defendant\u2019s acquisition of some\nsort of private gain. The jury was instructed that peti\ntioners, who were employed by the city of Chicago, were\nobliged, \u201c[a]s part of the honest services they owed the\nCity and the people of the City of Chicago,\u201d to abide by a\nlaundry list of \u201claws, decrees, and policies,\u201d including a\n1983 civil consent decree entered into by the city which\nbarred patronage hiring for some city jobs. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 137\u2013140. The Seventh Circuit approved the instruc\ntion, again rejecting the Fifth Circuit\u2019s violation-of-state\nlaw principle. \u201cIt may well be,\u201d the court said, \u201cthat\nmerely by virtue of being public officials the defendants\ninherently owed the public a fiduciary duty to discharge\ntheir offices in the public\u2019s best interest.\u201d 523 F. 3d, at\n712. And though petitioners received no direct personal\nbenefit from the patronage they doled out on behalf of\ntheir political masters, the Seventh Circuit found it suffi\ncient that the patronage appointees\u2014who were not\ncharged in the scheme\u2014accrued private gain. Id., at 709.\n   Finally, in addition to presenting two of the principal\ndevices the Courts of Appeals have used in an effort to\nlimit \u00a71346, the case also squarely presents the issue of its\nconstitutionality. The Court of Appeals rebuffed petition\ners\u2019 argument that if \u00a71346 really criminalizes all conduct\nthat is not \u201cin the public\u2019s best interest\u201d and that benefits\nsomeone, it is void for vagueness. The court cited two\nprior Circuit decisions which, it said, \u201cprovided sufficient\nnotice.\u201d Id., at 711.\n   It may be true that petitioners here, like the defendants\nin other \u201chonest services\u201d cases, have acted improperly.\nBut \u201c[b]ad men, like good men, are entitled to be tried and\nsentenced in accordance with law.\u201d Green v. United\nStates, 365 U. S. 301, 309 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting). In\nlight of the conflicts among the Circuits; the longstanding\n6                SORICH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconfusion over the scope of the statute; and the serious\ndue process and federalism interests affected by the ex\npansion of criminal liability that this case exemplifies, I\nwould grant the petition for certiorari and squarely con\nfront both the meaning and the constitutionality of \u00a71346.\nIndeed, it seems to me quite irresponsible to let the cur\nrent chaos prevail.\n",

United\nStates, 365 U. S. 301, 309 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting). In\nlight of the conflicts among the Circuits; the longstanding\n6                SORICH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconfusion over the scope of the statute; and the serious\ndue process and federalism interests affected by the ex\npansion of criminal liability that this case exemplifies, I\nwould grant the petition for certiorari and squarely con\nfront both the meaning and the constitutionality of \u00a71346.\nIndeed, it seems to me quite irresponsible to let the cur\nrent chaos prevail.\n</pre>",
