UNITED STATES \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n             No. 08–410.   Decided February 23, 2009 \n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n  In McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987), this\nCourt held that while “[t]he mail fraud statute clearly\nprotects property rights, . . . [it] does not refer to the in\ntangible right of the citizenry to good government.” Id., at\n356. That holding invalidated the theory that official\ncorruption and misconduct, by depriving citizens of their\n“intangible right” to the honest and impartial services of\ngovernment, constituted fraud. Although all of the Fed\neral Courts of Appeals had accepted the theory, see id., at\n364 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), we declined to “construe the\nstatute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries am\nbiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting\nstandards of disclosure and good government for local and\nstate officials.” Id., at 360 (majority opinion). “If Congress\ndesires to go further,” we said, “it must speak more clearly\nthan it has.” Ibid.\n  Congress spoke shortly thereafter. “For the purposes of\nthis chapter, the term ‘scheme or artifice to defraud’ in\ncludes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intan\ngible right of honest services.”          18 U. S. C. §1346.\nWhether that terse amendment qualifies as speaking\n“more clearly” or in any way lessens the vagueness and\nfederalism concerns that produced this Court’s decision in\nMcNally is another matter.\n  Though it consists of only 28 words, the statute has been\n2                SORICH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ninvoked to impose criminal penalties upon a staggeringly\nbroad swath of behavior, including misconduct not only by\npublic officials and employees but also by private employ\nees and corporate fiduciaries. Courts have upheld convic\ntions of a local housing official who failed to disclose a\nconflict of interest, United States v. Hasner, 340 F. 3d\n1261, 1271 (CA11 2003) (per curiam); a businessman who\nattempted to pay a state legislator to exercise “informal\nand behind-the-scenes influence on legislation,” United\nStates v. Potter, 463 F. 3d 9, 18 (CA1 2006); students who\nschemed with their professors to turn in plagiarized work,\nUnited States v. Frost, 125 F. 3d 346, 369 (CA6 1997);\nlawyers who made side-payments to insurance adjusters\nin exchange for the expedited processing of their clients’\npending claims, United States v. Rybicki, 354 F. 3d 124,\n142 (CA2 2003) (en banc); and, in the decision we are\nasked to review here, city employees who engaged in\npolitical-patronage hiring for local civil-service jobs, 523\nF. 3d 702, 705 (CA7 2008).\n   If the “honest services” theory—broadly stated, that\nofficeholders and employees owe a duty to act only in the\nbest interests of their constituents and employers—is\ntaken seriously and carried to its logical conclusion, pre\nsumably the statute also renders criminal a state legisla\ntor’s decision to vote for a bill because he expects it will\ncurry favor with a small minority essential to his reelec\ntion; a mayor’s attempt to use the prestige of his office to\nobtain a restaurant table without a reservation; a public\nemployee’s recommendation of his incompetent friend for a\npublic contract; and any self-dealing by a corporate officer.\nIndeed, it would seemingly cover a salaried employee’s\nphoning in sick to go to a ball game. In many cases, more\nover, the maximum penalty for violating this statute will\nbe added to the maximum penalty for violating 18 U. S. C.\n§666, a federal bribery statute, since violation of the latter\nrequires the additional factor of the employer’s receipt of\n                  Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfederal funds, while violation of the “honest services”\nprovision requires use of mail or wire services, §§1341,\n1343. Quite a potent federal prosecutorial tool.\n   To avoid some of these extreme results, the Courts of\nAppeals have spent two decades attempting to cabin the\nbreadth of §1346 through a variety of limiting principles.\nNo consensus has emerged. The Fifth Circuit has held\nthat the statute criminalizes only a deprivation of services\nthat is unlawful under state law, United States v. Brum\nley, 116 F. 3d 728, 735 (1997) (en banc), but other courts\nhave not agreed, see United States v. Martin, 195 F. 3d\n961, 966 (CA7 1999) (Brumley “is contrary to the law in\nthis circuit . . . and in the other circuits to have addressed\nthe question”). The Seventh Circuit has construed the\nstatute to prohibit only the abuse of position “for private\ngain,” United States v. Bloom, 149 F. 3d 649, 655 (1998),\nbut other Circuits maintain that gain is not an element of\nthe crime at all, e.g., United States v. Panarella, 277 F. 3d\n678, 692 (CA3 2002). Courts have expressed frustration at\nthe lack of any “simple formula specific enough to give\nclear cut answers to borderline problems.” United States\nv. Urciuoli, 513 F. 3d 290, 300 (CA1 2008).\n   It is practically gospel in the lower courts that the stat\nute “does not encompass every instance of official miscon\nduct,” United States v. Sawyer, 85 F. 3d 713, 725 (CA1\n1996). The Tenth Circuit has confidently proclaimed that\nthe statute is “not violated by every breach of contract,\nbreach of duty, conflict of interest, or misstatement made\nin the course of dealing,” United States v. Welch, 327 F. 3d\n1081, 1107 (CA10 2003). But why that is so, and what\nprinciple it is that separates the criminal breaches, con\nflicts and misstatements from the obnoxious but lawful\nones, remains entirely unspecified. Without some coher\nent limiting principle to define what “the intangible right\nof honest services” is, whence it derives, and how it is\nviolated, this expansive phrase invites abuse by headline\n4                SORICH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ngrabbing prosecutors in pursuit of local officials, state\nlegislators, and corporate CEOs who engage in any man\nner of unappealing or ethically questionable conduct.\n  In the background of the interpretive venture remain\nthe two concerns voiced by this Court in McNally. First,\nthe prospect of federal prosecutors’ (or federal courts’)\ncreating ethics codes and setting disclosure requirements\nfor local and state officials. Is it the role of the Federal\nGovernment to define the fiduciary duties that a town\nalderman or school board trustee owes to his constituents?\nIt is one thing to enact and enforce clear rules against\ncertain types of corrupt behavior, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §666(a)\n(bribes and gratuities to public officials), but quite another\nto mandate a freestanding, open-ended duty to provide\n“honest services”—with the details to be worked out case\nby-case. See generally Brown, Should Federalism Shield\nCorruption?—Mail Fraud, State Law and Post-Lopez\nAnalysis, 82 Cornell L. Rev. 225 (1997).\n  Second and relatedly, this Court has long recognized the\n“basic principle that a criminal statute must give fair\nwarning of the conduct that it makes a crime.” Bouie v.\nCity of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 350 (1964). There is a\nserious argument that §1346 is nothing more than an\ninvitation for federal courts to develop a common-law\ncrime of unethical conduct. But “the notion of a common\nlaw crime is utterly anathema today,” Rogers v. Tennessee,\n532 U. S. 451, 476 (2001) (SCALIA, J., dissenting), and for\ngood reason. It is simply not fair to prosecute someone for\na crime that has not been defined until the judicial deci\nsion that sends him to jail. “How can the public be ex\npected to know what the statute means when the judges\nand prosecutors themselves do not know, or must make it\nup as they go along?” Rybicki, supra, at 160 (Jacobs, J.,\ndissenting).\n  The present case in which certiorari is sought implicates\ntwo of the limiting principles that the Courts of Appeals\n                 Cite as: 555 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhave debated—whether the crime of deprivation of “honest\nservices” requires a predicate violation of state law, and\nwhether it requires the defendant’s acquisition of some\nsort of private gain. The jury was instructed that peti\ntioners, who were employed by the city of Chicago, were\nobliged, “[a]s part of the honest services they owed the\nCity and the people of the City of Chicago,” to abide by a\nlaundry list of “laws, decrees, and policies,” including a\n1983 civil consent decree entered into by the city which\nbarred patronage hiring for some city jobs. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 137–140. The Seventh Circuit approved the instruc\ntion, again rejecting the Fifth Circuit’s violation-of-state\nlaw principle. “It may well be,” the court said, “that\nmerely by virtue of being public officials the defendants\ninherently owed the public a fiduciary duty to discharge\ntheir offices in the public’s best interest.” 523 F. 3d, at\n712. And though petitioners received no direct personal\nbenefit from the patronage they doled out on behalf of\ntheir political masters, the Seventh Circuit found it suffi\ncient that the patronage appointees—who were not\ncharged in the scheme—accrued private gain. Id., at 709.\n   Finally, in addition to presenting two of the principal\ndevices the Courts of Appeals have used in an effort to\nlimit §1346, the case also squarely presents the issue of its\nconstitutionality. The Court of Appeals rebuffed petition\ners’ argument that if §1346 really criminalizes all conduct\nthat is not “in the public’s best interest” and that benefits\nsomeone, it is void for vagueness. The court cited two\nprior Circuit decisions which, it said, “provided sufficient\nnotice.” Id., at 711.\n   It may be true that petitioners here, like the defendants\nin other “honest services” cases, have acted improperly.\nBut “[b]ad men, like good men, are entitled to be tried and\nsentenced in accordance with law.” Green v. United\nStates, 365 U. S. 301, 309 (1961) (Black, J., dissenting). In\nlight of the conflicts among the Circuits; the longstanding\n6                SORICH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconfusion over the scope of the statute; and the serious\ndue process and federalism interests affected by the ex\npansion of criminal liability that this case exemplifies, I\nwould grant the petition for certiorari and squarely con\nfront both the meaning and the constitutionality of §1346.\nIndeed, it seems to me quite irresponsible to let the cur\nrent chaos prevail.\n</pre>", "id": 145968, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2009/02/23/Sorich_v._United_States.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 555 U.
