CARPENTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u2013678.      Argued October 5, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nWhen respondent Norman Carpenter informed the human resources\n department of his employer, petitioner Mohawk Industries, Inc., that\n the company employed undocumented immigrants, he was unaware\n that Mohawk stood accused in a pending class action\u2014the Williams\n case\u2014of conspiring to drive down its legal employees\u2019 wages by know\n ingly hiring undocumented workers. Mohawk directed Carpenter to\n meet with the company\u2019s retained counsel in Williams, who allegedly\n pressured Carpenter to recant his statements. When he refused,\n Carpenter maintains in this unlawful termination suit, Mohawk fired\n him under false pretenses. In granting Carpenter\u2019s motion to compel\n Mohawk to produce information concerning his meeting with re\n tained counsel and the company\u2019s termination decision, the District\n Court agreed with Mohawk that the requested information was pro\n tected by the attorney-client privilege, but concluded that Mohawk\n had implicitly waived the privilege through its disclosures in the Wil\n liams case. The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory\n appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mohawk\u2019s appeal for lack\n of jurisdiction, holding, inter alia, that the District Court\u2019s ruling did\n not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order under\n Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, because a\n discovery order implicating the attorney-client privilege can be ade\n quately reviewed on appeal from final judgment.\nHeld: Disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege do not\n qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.\n Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) Courts of Appeals \u201chave jurisdiction of appeals from all final de\n cisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291. \u201cFinal decisions\u201d\n encompass not only judgments that \u201cterminate an action,\u201d but also a\n2            MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    \u201csmall class\u201d of prejudgment orders that are \u201ccollateral to\u201d an action\u2019s\n    merits and \u201ctoo important\u201d to be denied immediate review, Cohen,\n    supra, at 545\u2013546. \u201cThat small category includes only decisions that\n    are . . . effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in\n    the underlying action.\u201d Swint v. Chambers County Comm\u2019n, 514\n    U. S. 35, 42. The decisive consideration in determining whether a\n    right is effectively unreviewable is whether delaying review until the\n    entry of final judgment \u201cwould imperil a substantial public interest\u201d\n    or \u201csome particular value of a high order.\u201d Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S.\n    345, 352\u2013353. In making this determination, the Court does not en\n    gage in an \u201cindividualized jurisdictional inquiry,\u201d Coopers & Lybrand\n    v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 473, but focuses on \u201cthe entire category to\n    which a claim belongs,\u201d Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\n    Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868. If the class of claims, taken as a whole, can\n    be adequately vindicated by other means, \u201cthe chance that the litiga\n    tion at hand might be speeded, or a \u2018particular injustic[e]\u2019 averted,\u201d\n    does not provide a basis for \u00a71291 jurisdiction. Ibid. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Effective appellate review of disclosure orders adverse to the at\n    torney-client privilege can be had by means other than collateral or\n    der appeal, including postjudgment review. Appellate courts can\n    remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same\n    way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by va\n    cating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which\n    the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.\n    Moreover, litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel\n    privilege ruling have several potential avenues of immediate review\n    apart from collateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district\n    court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory\n    appeal involving \u201ca controlling question of law\u201d the prompt resolution\n    of which \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n    litigation.\u201d \u00a71292(b). Second, in extraordinary circumstances where\n    a disclosure order works a manifest injustice, a party may petition\n    the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. Cheney v. United States\n    Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380. Another option is for a party\n    to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions that,\n    e.g., \u201cdirec[t] that the matters embraced in the order or other desig\n    nated facts be taken as established,\u201d \u201cprohibi[t] the disobedient party\n    from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses,\u201d or\n    \u201cstrik[e] pleadings in whole or in part.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2).\n    Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant, a district court may\n    issue a contempt order against a noncomplying party, who can then\n    appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation\n    can be characterized as a criminal punishment. See, e.g., Church of\n    Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11. These es\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198, 209. Pp. 6\u201312.\n     (c) The admonition that the class of collaterally appealable orders\n  must remain \u201cnarrow and selective in its membership,\u201d Will, supra,\n  at 350, has acquired special force in recent years with the enactment\n  of legislation designating rulemaking, \u201cnot expansion by court deci\n  sion,\u201d as the preferred means for determining whether and when pre\n  judgment orders should be immediately appealable, Swint, supra, at\n  48.

Although \u201cfinal\ndecisions\u201d typically are ones that trigger the entry of\njudgment, they also include a small set of prejudgment\norders that are \u201ccollateral to\u201d the merits of an action and\n\u201ctoo important\u201d to be denied immediate review. Cohen v.\nBeneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546\n(1949). In this case, petitioner Mohawk Industries, Inc.,\nattempted to bring a collateral order appeal after the\nDistrict Court ordered it to disclose certain confidential\nmaterials on the ground that Mohawk had waived the\nattorney-client privilege. The Court of Appeals dismissed\nthe appeal for want of jurisdiction.\n  The question before us is whether disclosure orders\nadverse to the attorney-client privilege qualify for imme\ndiate appeal under the collateral order doctrine. Agreeing\nwith the Court of Appeals, we hold that they do not.\nPostjudgment appeals, together with other review mecha\nnisms, suffice to protect the rights of litigants and pre\n2         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nserve the vitality of the attorney-client privilege.\n                              I\n   In 2007, respondent Norman Carpenter, a former shift\nsupervisor at a Mohawk manufacturing facility, filed suit\nin the United States District Court for the Northern Dis\ntrict of Georgia, alleging that Mohawk had terminated\nhim in violation of 42 U. S. C. \u00a71985(2) and various Geor\ngia laws. According to Carpenter\u2019s complaint, his termi\nnation came after he informed a member of Mohawk\u2019s\nhuman resources department in an e-mail that the com\npany was employing undocumented immigrants. At the\ntime, unbeknownst to Carpenter, Mohawk stood accused\nin a pending class-action lawsuit of conspiring to drive\ndown the wages of its legal employees by knowingly hiring\nundocumented workers in violation of federal and state\nracketeering laws. See Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc.,\nNo. 4:04\u2013cv\u201300003\u2013HLM (ND Ga., Jan. 6, 2004). Com\npany officials directed Carpenter to meet with the com\npany\u2019s retained counsel in the Williams case, and counsel\nallegedly pressured Carpenter to recant his statements.\nWhen he refused, Carpenter alleges, Mohawk fired him\nunder false pretenses. App. 57a\u201364a.\n   After learning of Carpenter\u2019s complaint, the plaintiffs in\nthe Williams case sought an evidentiary hearing to ex\nplore Carpenter\u2019s allegations. In its response to their\nmotion, Mohawk described Carpenter\u2019s accusations as\n\u201cpure fantasy\u201d and recounted the \u201ctrue facts\u201d of Carpen\nter\u2019s dismissal. Id., at 208a. According to Mohawk, Car\npenter himself had \u201cengaged in blatant and illegal mis\nconduct\u201d by attempting to have Mohawk hire an\nundocumented worker. Id., at 209a. The company \u201ccom\nmenced an immediate investigation,\u201d during which re\ntained counsel interviewed Carpenter. Id., at 210a.

S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy,\u201d the company terminated him. Ibid.\n   As these events were unfolding in the Williams case,\ndiscovery was underway in Carpenter\u2019s case. Carpenter\nfiled a motion to compel Mohawk to produce information\nconcerning his meeting with retained counsel and the\ncompany\u2019s termination decision. Mohawk maintained that\nthe requested information was protected by the attorney\nclient privilege.\n   The District Court agreed that the privilege applied to\nthe requested information, but it granted Carpenter\u2019s\nmotion to compel disclosure after concluding that Mohawk\nhad implicitly waived the privilege through its representa\ntions in the Williams case. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.\nThe court declined to certify its order for interlocutory\nappeal under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71292(b). But, recognizing \u201cthe\nseriousness of its [waiver] finding,\u201d it stayed its ruling to\nallow Mohawk to explore other potential \u201cavenues to\nappeal . . . , such as a petition for mandamus or appealing\nthis Order under the collateral order doctrine.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 52a.\n   Mohawk filed a notice of appeal and a petition for a writ\nof mandamus to the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Ap\npeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71291, holding that the District Court\u2019s ruling did\nnot qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order\nwithin the meaning of Cohen, 337 U. S. 541. \u201cUnder\nCohen,\u201d the Court of Appeals explained, \u201can order is ap\npealable if it (1) conclusively determines the disputed\nquestion; (2) resolves an important issue completely sepa\nrate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d 541 F. 3d\n1048, 1052 (2008) (per curiam). According to the court,\nthe District Court\u2019s waiver ruling satisfied the first two of\nthese requirements but not the third, because \u201ca discovery\norder that implicates the attorney-client privilege\u201d can be\nadequately reviewed \u201con appeal from a final judgment.\u201d\n4          MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nIbid. The Court of Appeals also rejected Mohawk\u2019s man\ndamus petition, finding no \u201cclear usurpation of power or\nabuse of discretion\u201d by the District Court. Id., at 1055.\nWe granted certiorari, 555 U. S. __ (2009), to resolve a\nconflict among the Circuits concerning the availability of\ncollateral appeals in the attorney-client privilege context.1\n                               II \n\n                               A\n\n  By statute, Courts of Appeals \u201chave jurisdiction of ap\npeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the\nUnited States, . . . except where a direct review may be\nhad in the Supreme Court.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291. A \u201cfinal\ndecisio[n]\u201d is typically one \u201cby which a district court disas\nsociates itself from a case.\u201d Swint v. Chambers County\nComm\u2019n, 514 U. S. 35, 42 (1995). This Court, however,\n\u201chas long given\u201d \u00a71291 a \u201cpractical rather than a technical\nconstruction.\u201d Cohen, 337 U. S., at 546. As we held in\nCohen, the statute encompasses not only judgments that\n\u201cterminate an action,\u201d but also a \u201csmall class\u201d of collateral\nrulings that, although they do not end the litigation, are\nappropriately deemed \u201cfinal.\u201d Id., at 545\u2013546. \u201cThat\nsmall category includes only decisions that are conclusive,\nthat resolve important questions separate from the merits,\nand that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Three Circuits have permitted collateral order appeals of attorney\n\nclient privilege rulings. See In re Napster, Inc. Copyright Litigation,\n479 F. 3d 1078, 1087\u20131088 (CA9 2007); United States v.

The remaining Circuits to consider the\nquestion have found such orders nonappealable. See, e.g., Boughton v.\nCotter Corp., 10 F. 3d 746, 749\u2013750 (CA10 1993); Texaco Inc. v.

S., at 42.\n   In applying Cohen\u2019s collateral order doctrine, we have\nstressed that it must \u201cnever be allowed to swallow the\ngeneral rule that a party is entitled to a single appeal, to\nbe deferred until final judgment has been entered.\u201d Digi\ntal Equipment Corp. v.

Our admonition reflects a healthy respect for\nthe virtues of the final-judgment rule. Permitting piece\nmeal, prejudgment appeals, we have recognized, under\nmines \u201cefficient judicial administration\u201d and encroaches\nupon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a\n\u201cspecial role\u201d in managing ongoing litigation. Firestone\nTire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 374 (1981);\nsee also Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424,\n436 (1985) (\u201c[T]he district judge can better exercise [his or\nher] responsibility [to police the prejudgment tactics of\nlitigants] if the appellate courts do not repeatedly inter\nvene to second-guess prejudgment rulings\u201d).\n   The justification for immediate appeal must therefore be\nsufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of defer\nring appeal until litigation concludes. This requirement\nfinds expression in two of the three traditional Cohen\nconditions. The second condition insists upon \u201cimportant\nquestions separate from the merits.\u201d Swint, 514 U. S., at\n42 (emphasis added). More significantly, \u201cthe third Cohen\nquestion, whether a right is \u2018adequately vindicable\u2019 or\n\u2018effectively reviewable,\u2019 simply cannot be answered with\nout a judgment about the value of the interests that would\nbe lost through rigorous application of a final judgment\nrequirement.\u201d Digital Equipment, 511 U. S., at 878\u2013879.\nThat a ruling \u201cmay burden litigants in ways that are only\nimperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a final\ndistrict court judgment . . . has never sufficed.\u201d Id., at 872.\n6        MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInstead, the decisive consideration is whether delaying\nreview until the entry of final judgment \u201cwould imperil a\nsubstantial public interest\u201d or \u201csome particular value of a\nhigh order.\u201d Will, 546 U. S., at 352\u2013353.\n  In making this determination, we do not engage in an\n\u201cindividualized jurisdictional inquiry.\u201d Coopers & Ly\nbrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 473 (1978). Rather, our\nfocus is on \u201cthe entire category to which a claim belongs.\u201d\nDigital Equipment, 511 U. S., at 868. As long as the class\nof claims, taken as a whole, can be adequately vindicated\nby other means, \u201cthe chance that the litigation at hand\nmight be speeded, or a \u2018particular injustic[e]\u2019 averted,\u201d\ndoes not provide a basis for jurisdiction under \u00a71291.

Because we agree with the\nCourt of Appeals that collateral order appeals are not\nnecessary to ensure effective review of orders adverse to\nthe attorney-client privilege, we do not decide whether the\nother Cohen requirements are met.\n   Mohawk does not dispute that \u201cwe have generally de\nnied review of pretrial discovery orders.\u201d Firestone, 449\nU.

Coo\nper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73914.23, p. 123 (2d\ned. 1992) (hereinafter Wright & Miller) (\u201c[T]he rule re\nmains settled that most discovery rulings are not final\u201d).\nMohawk contends, however, that rulings implicating the\nattorney-client privilege differ in kind from run-of-the-mill\ndiscovery orders because of the important institutional\ninterests at stake. According to Mohawk, the right to\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Brief for Petitioner 23.\n   We readily acknowledge the importance of the attorney\nclient privilege, which \u201cis one of the oldest recognized\nprivileges for confidential communications.\u201d Swidler &\nBerlin v. United States, 524 U. S. 399, 403 (1998). By\nassuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients\nto make \u201cfull and frank\u201d disclosures to their attorneys,\nwho are then better able to provide candid advice and\neffective representation. Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449\nU. S. 383, 389 (1981). This, in turn, serves \u201cbroader public\ninterests in the observance of law and administration of\njustice.\u201d Ibid.\n   The crucial question, however, is not whether an inter\nest is important in the abstract; it is whether deferring\nreview until final judgment so imperils the interest as to\njustify the cost of allowing immediate appeal of the entire\nclass of relevant orders. We routinely require litigants to\nwait until after final judgment to vindicate valuable\nrights, including rights central to our adversarial system.\nSee, e.g., Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 426 (holding an\norder disqualifying counsel in a civil case did not qualify\nfor immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine);\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259, 260 (1984)\n(reaching the same result in a criminal case, notwith\nstanding the Sixth Amendment rights at stake). In Digi\ntal Equipment, we rejected an assertion that collateral\norder review was necessary to promote \u201cthe public policy\nfavoring voluntary resolution of disputes.\u201d 511 U. S., at\n881. \u201cIt defies common sense,\u201d we explained, \u201cto maintain\nthat parties\u2019 readiness to settle will be significantly damp\nened (or the corresponding public interest impaired) by a\nrule that a district court\u2019s decision to let allegedly barred\nlitigation go forward may be challenged as a matter of\n8        MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nright only on appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff\u2019s\nfavor.\u201d Ibid.\n   We reach a similar conclusion here. In our estimation,\npostjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the\nrights of litigants and assure the vitality of the attorney\nclient privilege. Appellate courts can remedy the improper\ndisclosure of privileged material in the same way they\nremedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by\nvacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new\ntrial in which the protected material and its fruits are\nexcluded from evidence.\n   Dismissing such relief as inadequate, Mohawk empha\nsizes that the attorney-client privilege does not merely\n\u201cprohibi[t] use of protected information at trial\u201d; it pro\nvides a \u201cright not to disclose the privileged information in\nthe first place.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 25. Mohawk is un\ndoubtedly correct that an order to disclose privileged\ninformation intrudes on the confidentiality of attorney\nclient communications. But deferring review until final\njudgment does not meaningfully reduce the ex ante incen\ntives for full and frank consultations between clients and\ncounsel.\n   One reason for the lack of a discernible chill is that, in\ndeciding how freely to speak, clients and counsel are\nunlikely to focus on the remote prospect of an erroneous\ndisclosure order, let alone on the timing of a possible\nappeal. Whether or not immediate collateral order ap\npeals are available, clients and counsel must account for\nthe possibility that they will later be required by law to\ndisclose their communications for a variety of reasons\u2014for\nexample, because they misjudged the scope of the privi\nlege, because they waived the privilege, or because their\ncommunications fell within the privilege\u2019s crime-fraud\nexception. Most district court rulings on these matters\ninvolve the routine application of settled legal principles.\nThey are unlikely to be reversed on appeal, particularly\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen they rest on factual determinations for which appel\nlate deference is the norm. See, e.g., Richardson-Merrell,\n472 U. S., at 434 (\u201cMost pretrial orders of district judges\nare ultimately affirmed by appellate courts.\u201d); Reise v.\nBoard of Regents, 957 F. 2d 293, 295 (CA7 1992) (noting\nthat \u201calmost all interlocutory appeals from discovery\norders would end in affirmance\u201d because \u201cthe district court\npossesses discretion, and review is deferential\u201d). The\nbreadth of the privilege and the narrowness of its excep\ntions will thus tend to exert a much greater influence on\nthe conduct of clients and counsel than the small risk that\nthe law will be misapplied.2\n   Moreover, were attorneys and clients to reflect upon\ntheir appellate options, they would find that litigants\nconfronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege\nruling have several potential avenues of review apart from\ncollateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district\ncourt to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an\ninterlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71292(b). The\npreconditions for \u00a71292(b) review\u2014\u201ca controlling question\nof law,\u201d the prompt resolution of which \u201cmay materially\nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation\u201d\u2014are\nmost likely to be satisfied when a privilege ruling involves\na new legal question or is of special consequence, and\ndistrict courts should not hesitate to certify an interlocu\ntory appeal in such cases. Second, in extraordinary cir\ncumstances\u2014i.e., when a disclosure order \u201camount[s] to a\njudicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion,\u201d\nor otherwise works a manifest injustice\u2014a party may\npetition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.\nCheney v. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S.\n367, 390 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Perhaps the situation would be different if district courts were sys\n\ntematically underenforcing the privilege, but we have no indication\nthat this is the case.\n10         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted); see also Firestone, 449 U. S., at 378\u2013379, n. 13.3\nWhile these discretionary review mechanisms do not\nprovide relief in every case, they serve as useful \u201csafety\nvalve[s]\u201d for promptly correcting serious errors. Digital\nEquipment, 511 U. S., at 883.\n   Another long-recognized option is for a party to defy a\ndisclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions. Dis\ntrict courts have a range of sanctions from which to\nchoose, including \u201cdirecting that the matters embraced in\nthe order or other designated facts be taken as established\nfor purposes of the action,\u201d \u201cprohibiting the disobedient\nparty from supporting or opposing designated claims or\ndefenses,\u201d or \u201cstriking pleadings in whole or in part.\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2)(i)\u2013(iii). Such sanctions allow a\nparty to obtain postjudgment review without having to\nreveal its privileged information. Alternatively, when the\ncircumstances warrant it, a district court may hold a\nnoncomplying party in contempt. The party can then\nappeal directly from that ruling, at least when the con\ntempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punish\nment. See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United\nStates, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11 (1992); Firestone, 449 U. S., at\n377; Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 328\n(1940); see also Wright & Miller \u00a73914.23, at 140\u2013155.\n   These established mechanisms for appellate review not\nonly provide assurances to clients and counsel about the\nsecurity of their confidential communications; they also go\na long way toward addressing Mohawk\u2019s concern that,\nabsent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client\nprivilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe\nhardship. Mohawk is no doubt right that an order to\ndisclose privileged material may, in some situations, have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 Mohawk itself petitioned the Eleventh Circuit for a writ of manda\n\nmus.

But the same can\nbe said about many categories of pretrial discovery orders\nfor which collateral order appeals are unavailable. As\nwith these other orders, rulings adverse to the privilege\nvary in their significance; some may be momentous, but\nothers are more mundane. Section 1292(b) appeals, man\ndamus, and appeals from contempt citations facilitate\nimmediate review of some of the more consequential at\ntorney-client privilege rulings. Moreover, protective or\nders are available to limit the spillover effects of disclosing\nsensitive information. That a fraction of orders adverse to\nthe attorney-client privilege may nevertheless harm indi\nvidual litigants in ways that are \u201conly imperfectly repara\nble\u201d does not justify making all such orders immediately\nappealable as of right under \u00a71291. Digital Equipment,\n511 U. S., at 872.\n  In short, the limited benefits of applying \u201cthe blunt,\ncategorical instrument of \u00a71291 collateral order appeal\u201d to\nprivilege-related disclosure orders simply cannot justify\nthe likely institutional costs. Id., at 883. Permitting\nparties to undertake successive, piecemeal appeals of all\nadverse attorney-client rulings would unduly delay the\nresolution of district court litigation and needlessly burden\nthe Courts of Appeals. See Wright & Miller \u00a73914.23, at\n123 (\u201cRoutine appeal from disputed discovery orders\nwould disrupt the orderly progress of the litigation, swamp\nthe courts of appeals, and substantially reduce the district\ncourt\u2019s ability to control the discovery process.\u201d); cf. Cun\nningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198, 209 (1999)\n(expressing concern that allowing immediate appeal as of\nright from orders fining attorneys for discovery violations\nwould result in \u201cthe very sorts of piecemeal appeals and\nconcomitant delays that the final judgment rule was de\nsigned to prevent\u201d). Attempting to downplay such con\ncerns, Mohawk asserts that the three Circuits in which\nthe collateral order doctrine currently applies to adverse\n12         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprivilege rulings have seen only a trickle of appeals. But\nthis may be due to the fact that the practice in all three\nCircuits is relatively new and not yet widely known. Were\nthis Court to approve collateral order appeals in the attor\nney-client privilege context, many more litigants would\nlikely choose that route. They would also likely seek to\nextend such a ruling to disclosure orders implicating many\nother categories of sensitive information, raising an array\nof line-drawing difficulties.4\n                             C\n   In concluding that sufficiently effective review of ad\nverse attorney-client privilege rulings can be had without\nresort to the Cohen doctrine, we reiterate that the class of\ncollaterally appealable orders must remain \u201cnarrow and\nselective in its membership.\u201d Will, 546 U. S., at 350. This\nadmonition has acquired special force in recent years with\nthe enactment of legislation designating rulemaking, \u201cnot\nexpansion by court decision,\u201d as the preferred means for\ndetermining whether and when prejudgment orders\nshould be immediately appealable. Swint, 514 U. S., at\n48. Specifically, Congress in 1990 amended the Rules\nEnabling Act, 28 U. S.

It is for that reason that I do not join the\nremainder of the Court\u2019s analysis.\n   The scope of federal appellate jurisdiction is a matter\nthe Constitution expressly commits to Congress, see Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 9, and that Congress has addressed not only in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71291 and 1292, but also in the Rules Enabling\nAct amendments to which the Court refers. See ante, at\n12\u201313 (citing \u00a7\u00a72072\u20132074). The Court recognizes that\nthese amendments \u201cdesignat[e] rulemaking, \u2018not expan\nsion by court decision,\u2019 as the preferred means of deter\nmining whether and when prejudgment orders should be\n2        MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

Because that designation is entitled to our\nfull respect, and because the privilege order here is not on\nall fours with orders we previously have held to be appeal\nable under the collateral order doctrine, see Cohen v.\nBeneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), I\nwould affirm the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment on the\nground that any \u201cavenue for immediate appeal\u201d beyond\nthe three avenues addressed in the Court\u2019s opinion must\nbe left to the \u201crulemaking process.\u201d Ante, at 13; see ante,\nat 9\u201312 (discussing certification under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71292(b), petitions for mandamus, and appeals from con\ntempt orders).\n   We need not, and in my view should not, further justify\nour holding by applying the Cohen doctrine, which\nprompted the rulemaking amendments in the first place.\nIn taking this path, the Court needlessly perpetuates a\njudicial policy that we for many years have criticized and\nstruggled to limit. See, e.g., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8); Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S.\n345, 349 (2006); Sell v. United States, 539 U.

The Court\u2019s choice of analysis is the\nmore ironic because applying Cohen to the facts of this\ncase requires the Court to reach conclusions on, and thus\npotentially prejudice, the very matters it says would bene\nfit from \u201cthe collective experience of bench and bar\u201d and\nthe \u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that rulemaking provides.\nAnte, at 13.\n   \u201cFinality as a condition of review is an historic charac\nteristic of federal appellate procedure\u201d that was incorpo\nrated in the first Judiciary Act and that Congress itself\nhas \u201cdeparted from only when observance of it would\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

S. 323, 324\u2013325 (1940). Until\n1949, this Court\u2019s view of the appellate jurisdiction statute\nreflected this principle and the statute\u2019s text. See, e.g.,\nCatlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945) (holding\nthat \u00a7128 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291)\nlimits review to decisions that \u201cen[d] the litigation on the\nmerits and leav[e] nothing for the court to do but execute\nthe judgment\u201d). Cohen changed all that when it an\nnounced that a \u201csmall class\u201d of collateral orders that do\nnot meet the statutory definition of finality nonetheless\nmay be immediately appealable if they satisfy certain\ncriteria that show they are \u201ctoo important to be denied\nreview.\u201d 337 U. S., at 546.\n  Cohen and the early decisions applying it allowed \u00a71291\nappeals of interlocutory orders concerning the posting of a\nbond, see id., at 545\u2013547, the attachment of a vessel in\nadmiralty, see Swift & Co. Packers v. Compania Colombi\nana Del Caribe, S. A., 339 U. S. 684, 688\u2013689 (1950), and\nthe imposition of notice costs in a class action, see Eisen v.\nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 170\u2013172 (1974). As\nthe Court\u2019s opinion notes, later decisions sought to narrow\nCohen lest its exception to \u00a71291 \u201c \u2018 swallow\u2019 \u201d the final\njudgment rule.

The Court has ad\nhered to that narrowing approach, principally by raising\nthe bar on what types of interests are \u201cimportant enough\u201d\nto justify collateral order appeals. See, e.g., Will, supra, at\n352\u2013353 (explaining that an interlocutory order typically\nwill be \u201cimportant\u201d enough to justify Cohen review only\nwhere \u201csome particular value of a high order,\u201d such as\n\u201chonoring the separation of powers, preserving the effi\nciency of government . . . , [or] respecting a State\u2019s digni\ntary interests,\u201d is \u201cmarshaled in support of the interest in\navoiding trial\u201d and the Court determines that denying\n4         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

As we recognized last Term,\nhowever, our attempts to contain the Cohen doctrine have\nnot all been successful or persuasive. See Ashcroft, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[A]s a general matter, the collateral\norder doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits\ndictated by its internal logic and the strict application of\nthe criteria set out in Cohen\u201d). In my view, this case pre\nsents an opportunity to improve our approach.\n   The privilege interest at issue here is undoubtedly\nimportant, both in its own right and when compared to\nsome of the interests (e.g., in bond and notice-cost rulings)\nwe have held to be appealable under Cohen. Accordingly,\nthe Court\u2019s Cohen analysis does not rest on the privilege\norder\u2019s relative unimportance, but instead on its effective\nreviewability after final judgment. Ante, at 8\u201312. Al\nthough I agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, I see\ntwo difficulties with this approach. First, the Court em\nphasizes that the alternative avenues of review it dis\ncusses (which did not prove adequate in this case) would\nbe adequate where the privilege ruling at issue is \u201cparticu\nlarly injurious or novel.\u201d Ante, at 9. If that is right, and it\nseems to me that it is, then the opinion raises the question\nwhy such avenues were not also adequate to address the\norders whose unusual importance or particularly injurious\nnature we have held justified immediate appeal under\nCohen. See, e.g., Sell, supra, at 177. Second, the facts of\nthis particular case seem in several respects to undercut\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that the benefits of collateral order\nreview \u201ccannot justify the likely institutional costs.\u201d Ante,\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That is exactly right, and illustrates what in\ncreasingly has bothered me about making this kind of\nappealability determination via case-by-case adjudication.\nThe exercise forces the reviewing court to subordinate the\nrealities of each case before it to generalized conclusions\nabout the \u201clikely\u201d costs and benefits of allowing an excep\ntion to the final judgment rule in an entire \u201cclass of cases.\u201d\nThe Court concedes that Congress, which holds the consti\ntutional reins in this area, has determined that such value\njudgments are better left to the \u201ccollective experience of\nbench and bar\u201d and the \u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that\nrulemaking provides. Ante, at 13. This determination is\nentitled to our full respect, in deed as well as in word.\nAccordingly, I would leave the value judgments the Court\nmakes in its opinion to the rulemaking process, and in so\ndoing take this opportunity to limit\u2014effectively, predicta\nbly, and in a way we should have done long ago\u2014the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court concludes, for example, that in most cases final judgment\nreview of an erroneous privilege ruling will suffice to vindicate the\ninjured party\u2019s rights because the appellate court can vacate the\nadverse judgment and remand for a new trial in which the protected\nmaterial is excluded. Ante, at 8. But this case appears to involve one of\nthe (perhaps rare) situations in which final judgment review might not\nbe sufficient because it is a case in which the challenged order already\nhas had \u201cimplications beyond the case at hand,\u201d namely, in the sepa\nrate class action in Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., No. 4:04\u2013CV\u2013\n0003\u2013HLM (ND Ga.). Ante, at 11. The Court also concludes that the\n\u201clikely institutional costs\u201d of allowing collateral order review would\noutweigh its benefits because, inter alia, such review would \u201cneedlessly\nburden the Courts of Appeals.\u201d Ibid. But as the Court concedes, it\nmust speculate on this point because the three Circuits that allow\nCohen appeals of privilege rulings have not been overwhelmed.

CARPENTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 08\u2013678.      Argued October 5, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nWhen respondent Norman Carpenter informed the human resources\n department of his employer, petitioner Mohawk Industries, Inc., that\n the company employed undocumented immigrants, he was unaware\n that Mohawk stood accused in a pending class action\u2014the Williams\n case\u2014of conspiring to drive down its legal employees\u2019 wages by know\n ingly hiring undocumented workers. Mohawk directed Carpenter to\n meet with the company\u2019s retained counsel in Williams, who allegedly\n pressured Carpenter to recant his statements. When he refused,\n Carpenter maintains in this unlawful termination suit, Mohawk fired\n him under false pretenses. In granting Carpenter\u2019s motion to compel\n Mohawk to produce information concerning his meeting with re\n tained counsel and the company\u2019s termination decision, the District\n Court agreed with Mohawk that the requested information was pro\n tected by the attorney-client privilege, but concluded that Mohawk\n had implicitly waived the privilege through its disclosures in the Wil\n liams case. The court declined to certify its order for interlocutory\n appeal, and the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mohawk\u2019s appeal for lack\n of jurisdiction, holding, inter alia, that the District Court\u2019s ruling did\n not qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order under\n Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, because a\n discovery order implicating the attorney-client privilege can be ade\n quately reviewed on appeal from final judgment.\nHeld: Disclosure orders adverse to the attorney-client privilege do not\n qualify for immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.\n Pp. 4\u201313.\n    (a) Courts of Appeals \u201chave jurisdiction of appeals from all final de\n cisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.

Chambers County Comm\u2019n, 514\n    U. S. 35, 42. The decisive consideration in determining whether a\n    right is effectively unreviewable is whether delaying review until the\n    entry of final judgment \u201cwould imperil a substantial public interest\u201d\n    or \u201csome particular value of a high order.\u201d Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S.\n    345, 352\u2013353. In making this determination, the Court does not en\n    gage in an \u201cindividualized jurisdictional inquiry,\u201d Coopers & Lybrand\n    v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 473, but focuses on \u201cthe entire category to\n    which a claim belongs,\u201d Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct,\n    Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 868. If the class of claims, taken as a whole, can\n    be adequately vindicated by other means, \u201cthe chance that the litiga\n    tion at hand might be speeded, or a \u2018particular injustic[e]\u2019 averted,\u201d\n    does not provide a basis for \u00a71291 jurisdiction. Ibid. Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Effective appellate review of disclosure orders adverse to the at\n    torney-client privilege can be had by means other than collateral or\n    der appeal, including postjudgment review. Appellate courts can\n    remedy the improper disclosure of privileged material in the same\n    way they remedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by va\n    cating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new trial in which\n    the protected material and its fruits are excluded from evidence.\n    Moreover, litigants confronted with a particularly injurious or novel\n    privilege ruling have several potential avenues of immediate review\n    apart from collateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district\n    court to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an interlocutory\n    appeal involving \u201ca controlling question of law\u201d the prompt resolution\n    of which \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n    litigation.\u201d \u00a71292(b). Second, in extraordinary circumstances where\n    a disclosure order works a manifest injustice, a party may petition\n    the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. Cheney v. United States\n    Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380. Another option is for a party\n    to defy a disclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions that,\n    e.g., \u201cdirec[t] that the matters embraced in the order or other desig\n    nated facts be taken as established,\u201d \u201cprohibi[t] the disobedient party\n    from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses,\u201d or\n    \u201cstrik[e] pleadings in whole or in part.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2).\n    Alternatively, when the circumstances warrant, a district court may\n    issue a contempt order against a noncomplying party, who can then\n    appeal directly from that ruling, at least when the contempt citation\n    can be characterized as a criminal punishment. See, e.g., Church of\n    Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11. These es\n                     Cite as: 558 U.

In this case, petitioner Mohawk Industries, Inc.,\nattempted to bring a collateral order appeal after the\nDistrict Court ordered it to disclose certain confidential\nmaterials on the ground that Mohawk had waived the\nattorney-client privilege.

S. C. \u00a71985(2) and various Geor\ngia laws. According to Carpenter\u2019s complaint, his termi\nnation came after he informed a member of Mohawk\u2019s\nhuman resources department in an e-mail that the com\npany was employing undocumented immigrants. At the\ntime, unbeknownst to Carpenter, Mohawk stood accused\nin a pending class-action lawsuit of conspiring to drive\ndown the wages of its legal employees by knowingly hiring\nundocumented workers in violation of federal and state\nracketeering laws. See Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc.,\nNo. 4:04\u2013cv\u201300003\u2013HLM (ND Ga., Jan. 6, 2004). Com\npany officials directed Carpenter to meet with the com\npany\u2019s retained counsel in the Williams case, and counsel\nallegedly pressured Carpenter to recant his statements.\nWhen he refused, Carpenter alleges, Mohawk fired him\nunder false pretenses. App. 57a\u201364a.\n   After learning of Carpenter\u2019s complaint, the plaintiffs in\nthe Williams case sought an evidentiary hearing to ex\nplore Carpenter\u2019s allegations. In its response to their\nmotion, Mohawk described Carpenter\u2019s accusations as\n\u201cpure fantasy\u201d and recounted the \u201ctrue facts\u201d of Carpen\nter\u2019s dismissal. Id., at 208a. According to Mohawk, Car\npenter himself had \u201cengaged in blatant and illegal mis\nconduct\u201d by attempting to have Mohawk hire an\nundocumented worker. Id., at 209a.

Ibid.\n   As these events were unfolding in the Williams case,\ndiscovery was underway in Carpenter\u2019s case. Carpenter\nfiled a motion to compel Mohawk to produce information\nconcerning his meeting with retained counsel and the\ncompany\u2019s termination decision. Mohawk maintained that\nthe requested information was protected by the attorney\nclient privilege.\n   The District Court agreed that the privilege applied to\nthe requested information, but it granted Carpenter\u2019s\nmotion to compel disclosure after concluding that Mohawk\nhad implicitly waived the privilege through its representa\ntions in the Williams case. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a.\nThe court declined to certify its order for interlocutory\nappeal under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71292(b). But, recognizing \u201cthe\nseriousness of its [waiver] finding,\u201d it stayed its ruling to\nallow Mohawk to explore other potential \u201cavenues to\nappeal . . . , such as a petition for mandamus or appealing\nthis Order under the collateral order doctrine.\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 52a.\n   Mohawk filed a notice of appeal and a petition for a writ\nof mandamus to the Eleventh Circuit. The Court of Ap\npeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71291, holding that the District Court\u2019s ruling did\nnot qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order\nwithin the meaning of Cohen, 337 U. S. 541. \u201cUnder\nCohen,\u201d the Court of Appeals explained, \u201can order is ap\npealable if it (1) conclusively determines the disputed\nquestion; (2) resolves an important issue completely sepa\nrate from the merits of the action; and (3) is effectively\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d 541 F. 3d\n1048, 1052 (2008) (per curiam). According to the court,\nthe District Court\u2019s waiver ruling satisfied the first two of\nthese requirements but not the third, because \u201ca discovery\norder that implicates the attorney-client privilege\u201d can be\nadequately reviewed \u201con appeal from a final judgment.\u201d\n4          MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

As we held in\nCohen, the statute encompasses not only judgments that\n\u201cterminate an action,\u201d but also a \u201csmall class\u201d of collateral\nrulings that, although they do not end the litigation, are\nappropriately deemed \u201cfinal.\u201d Id., at 545\u2013546. \u201cThat\nsmall category includes only decisions that are conclusive,\nthat resolve important questions separate from the merits,\nand that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Three Circuits have permitted collateral order appeals of attorney\n\nclient privilege rulings.

Our admonition reflects a healthy respect for\nthe virtues of the final-judgment rule. Permitting piece\nmeal, prejudgment appeals, we have recognized, under\nmines \u201cefficient judicial administration\u201d and encroaches\nupon the prerogatives of district court judges, who play a\n\u201cspecial role\u201d in managing ongoing litigation.

Rather, our\nfocus is on \u201cthe entire category to which a claim belongs.\u201d\nDigital Equipment, 511 U. S., at 868. As long as the class\nof claims, taken as a whole, can be adequately vindicated\nby other means, \u201cthe chance that the litigation at hand\nmight be speeded, or a \u2018particular injustic[e]\u2019 averted,\u201d\ndoes not provide a basis for jurisdiction under \u00a71291. Ibid.\n(quoting Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.

Because we agree with the\nCourt of Appeals that collateral order appeals are not\nnecessary to ensure effective review of orders adverse to\nthe attorney-client privilege, we do not decide whether the\nother Cohen requirements are met.\n   Mohawk does not dispute that \u201cwe have generally de\nnied review of pretrial discovery orders.\u201d Firestone, 449\nU. S., at 377; see also 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Coo\nper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73914.23, p. 123 (2d\ned. 1992) (hereinafter Wright & Miller) (\u201c[T]he rule re\nmains settled that most discovery rulings are not final\u201d).\nMohawk contends, however, that rulings implicating the\nattorney-client privilege differ in kind from run-of-the-mill\ndiscovery orders because of the important institutional\ninterests at stake. According to Mohawk, the right to\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Brief for Petitioner 23.\n   We readily acknowledge the importance of the attorney\nclient privilege, which \u201cis one of the oldest recognized\nprivileges for confidential communications.\u201d Swidler &\nBerlin v. United States, 524 U. S. 399, 403 (1998). By\nassuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients\nto make \u201cfull and frank\u201d disclosures to their attorneys,\nwho are then better able to provide candid advice and\neffective representation. Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449\nU. S. 383, 389 (1981). This, in turn, serves \u201cbroader public\ninterests in the observance of law and administration of\njustice.\u201d Ibid.\n   The crucial question, however, is not whether an inter\nest is important in the abstract; it is whether deferring\nreview until final judgment so imperils the interest as to\njustify the cost of allowing immediate appeal of the entire\nclass of relevant orders. We routinely require litigants to\nwait until after final judgment to vindicate valuable\nrights, including rights central to our adversarial system.\nSee, e.g., Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 426 (holding an\norder disqualifying counsel in a civil case did not qualify\nfor immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine);\nFlanagan v. United States, 465 U. S. 259, 260 (1984)\n(reaching the same result in a criminal case, notwith\nstanding the Sixth Amendment rights at stake). In Digi\ntal Equipment, we rejected an assertion that collateral\norder review was necessary to promote \u201cthe public policy\nfavoring voluntary resolution of disputes.\u201d 511 U. S., at\n881. \u201cIt defies common sense,\u201d we explained, \u201cto maintain\nthat parties\u2019 readiness to settle will be significantly damp\nened (or the corresponding public interest impaired) by a\nrule that a district court\u2019s decision to let allegedly barred\nlitigation go forward may be challenged as a matter of\n8        MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nright only on appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff\u2019s\nfavor.\u201d Ibid.\n   We reach a similar conclusion here. In our estimation,\npostjudgment appeals generally suffice to protect the\nrights of litigants and assure the vitality of the attorney\nclient privilege. Appellate courts can remedy the improper\ndisclosure of privileged material in the same way they\nremedy a host of other erroneous evidentiary rulings: by\nvacating an adverse judgment and remanding for a new\ntrial in which the protected material and its fruits are\nexcluded from evidence.\n   Dismissing such relief as inadequate, Mohawk empha\nsizes that the attorney-client privilege does not merely\n\u201cprohibi[t] use of protected information at trial\u201d; it pro\nvides a \u201cright not to disclose the privileged information in\nthe first place.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 25. Mohawk is un\ndoubtedly correct that an order to disclose privileged\ninformation intrudes on the confidentiality of attorney\nclient communications. But deferring review until final\njudgment does not meaningfully reduce the ex ante incen\ntives for full and frank consultations between clients and\ncounsel.\n   One reason for the lack of a discernible chill is that, in\ndeciding how freely to speak, clients and counsel are\nunlikely to focus on the remote prospect of an erroneous\ndisclosure order, let alone on the timing of a possible\nappeal. Whether or not immediate collateral order ap\npeals are available, clients and counsel must account for\nthe possibility that they will later be required by law to\ndisclose their communications for a variety of reasons\u2014for\nexample, because they misjudged the scope of the privi\nlege, because they waived the privilege, or because their\ncommunications fell within the privilege\u2019s crime-fraud\nexception. Most district court rulings on these matters\ninvolve the routine application of settled legal principles.\nThey are unlikely to be reversed on appeal, particularly\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen they rest on factual determinations for which appel\nlate deference is the norm. See, e.g., Richardson-Merrell,\n472 U. S., at 434 (\u201cMost pretrial orders of district judges\nare ultimately affirmed by appellate courts.\u201d); Reise v.\nBoard of Regents, 957 F. 2d 293, 295 (CA7 1992) (noting\nthat \u201calmost all interlocutory appeals from discovery\norders would end in affirmance\u201d because \u201cthe district court\npossesses discretion, and review is deferential\u201d). The\nbreadth of the privilege and the narrowness of its excep\ntions will thus tend to exert a much greater influence on\nthe conduct of clients and counsel than the small risk that\nthe law will be misapplied.2\n   Moreover, were attorneys and clients to reflect upon\ntheir appellate options, they would find that litigants\nconfronted with a particularly injurious or novel privilege\nruling have several potential avenues of review apart from\ncollateral order appeal. First, a party may ask the district\ncourt to certify, and the court of appeals to accept, an\ninterlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a71292(b). The\npreconditions for \u00a71292(b) review\u2014\u201ca controlling question\nof law,\u201d the prompt resolution of which \u201cmay materially\nadvance the ultimate termination of the litigation\u201d\u2014are\nmost likely to be satisfied when a privilege ruling involves\na new legal question or is of special consequence, and\ndistrict courts should not hesitate to certify an interlocu\ntory appeal in such cases. Second, in extraordinary cir\ncumstances\u2014i.e., when a disclosure order \u201camount[s] to a\njudicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion,\u201d\nor otherwise works a manifest injustice\u2014a party may\npetition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.\nCheney v. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S.\n367, 390 (2004) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Perhaps the situation would be different if district courts were sys\n\ntematically underenforcing the privilege, but we have no indication\nthat this is the case.\n10         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nomitted); see also Firestone, 449 U. S., at 378\u2013379, n. 13.3\nWhile these discretionary review mechanisms do not\nprovide relief in every case, they serve as useful \u201csafety\nvalve[s]\u201d for promptly correcting serious errors. Digital\nEquipment, 511 U. S., at 883.\n   Another long-recognized option is for a party to defy a\ndisclosure order and incur court-imposed sanctions. Dis\ntrict courts have a range of sanctions from which to\nchoose, including \u201cdirecting that the matters embraced in\nthe order or other designated facts be taken as established\nfor purposes of the action,\u201d \u201cprohibiting the disobedient\nparty from supporting or opposing designated claims or\ndefenses,\u201d or \u201cstriking pleadings in whole or in part.\u201d Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2)(i)\u2013(iii). Such sanctions allow a\nparty to obtain postjudgment review without having to\nreveal its privileged information. Alternatively, when the\ncircumstances warrant it, a district court may hold a\nnoncomplying party in contempt. The party can then\nappeal directly from that ruling, at least when the con\ntempt citation can be characterized as a criminal punish\nment. See, e.g., Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United\nStates, 506 U. S. 9, 18, n. 11 (1992); Firestone, 449 U. S., at\n377; Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 328\n(1940); see also Wright & Miller \u00a73914.23, at 140\u2013155.\n   These established mechanisms for appellate review not\nonly provide assurances to clients and counsel about the\nsecurity of their confidential communications; they also go\na long way toward addressing Mohawk\u2019s concern that,\nabsent collateral order appeals of adverse attorney-client\nprivilege rulings, some litigants may experience severe\nhardship. Mohawk is no doubt right that an order to\ndisclose privileged material may, in some situations, have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 Mohawk itself petitioned the Eleventh Circuit for a writ of manda\n\nmus.

S. ____ (2009)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimplications beyond the case at hand. But the same can\nbe said about many categories of pretrial discovery orders\nfor which collateral order appeals are unavailable. As\nwith these other orders, rulings adverse to the privilege\nvary in their significance; some may be momentous, but\nothers are more mundane. Section 1292(b) appeals, man\ndamus, and appeals from contempt citations facilitate\nimmediate review of some of the more consequential at\ntorney-client privilege rulings. Moreover, protective or\nders are available to limit the spillover effects of disclosing\nsensitive information. That a fraction of orders adverse to\nthe attorney-client privilege may nevertheless harm indi\nvidual litigants in ways that are \u201conly imperfectly repara\nble\u201d does not justify making all such orders immediately\nappealable as of right under \u00a71291. Digital Equipment,\n511 U. S., at 872.\n  In short, the limited benefits of applying \u201cthe blunt,\ncategorical instrument of \u00a71291 collateral order appeal\u201d to\nprivilege-related disclosure orders simply cannot justify\nthe likely institutional costs. Id., at 883. Permitting\nparties to undertake successive, piecemeal appeals of all\nadverse attorney-client rulings would unduly delay the\nresolution of district court litigation and needlessly burden\nthe Courts of Appeals. See Wright & Miller \u00a73914.23, at\n123 (\u201cRoutine appeal from disputed discovery orders\nwould disrupt the orderly progress of the litigation, swamp\nthe courts of appeals, and substantially reduce the district\ncourt\u2019s ability to control the discovery process.\u201d); cf. Cun\nningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198, 209 (1999)\n(expressing concern that allowing immediate appeal as of\nright from orders fining attorneys for discovery violations\nwould result in \u201cthe very sorts of piecemeal appeals and\nconcomitant delays that the final judgment rule was de\nsigned to prevent\u201d). Attempting to downplay such con\ncerns, Mohawk asserts that the three Circuits in which\nthe collateral order doctrine currently applies to adverse\n12         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprivilege rulings have seen only a trickle of appeals. But\nthis may be due to the fact that the practice in all three\nCircuits is relatively new and not yet widely known. Were\nthis Court to approve collateral order appeals in the attor\nney-client privilege context, many more litigants would\nlikely choose that route. They would also likely seek to\nextend such a ruling to disclosure orders implicating many\nother categories of sensitive information, raising an array\nof line-drawing difficulties.4\n                             C\n   In concluding that sufficiently effective review of ad\nverse attorney-client privilege rulings can be had without\nresort to the Cohen doctrine, we reiterate that the class of\ncollaterally appealable orders must remain \u201cnarrow and\nselective in its membership.\u201d Will, 546 U. S., at 350. This\nadmonition has acquired special force in recent years with\nthe enactment of legislation designating rulemaking, \u201cnot\nexpansion by court decision,\u201d as the preferred means for\ndetermining whether and when prejudgment orders\nshould be immediately appealable. Swint, 514 U. S., at\n48. Specifically, Congress in 1990 amended the Rules\nEnabling Act, 28 U. S.

Chambers County Comm\u2019n, 514\nU. S. 35, 48 (1995); ante, at 13 (quoting Swint, supra;\nciting Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U. S. 198,\n210 (1999)). It is for that reason that I do not join the\nremainder of the Court\u2019s analysis.\n   The scope of federal appellate jurisdiction is a matter\nthe Constitution expressly commits to Congress, see Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 9, and that Congress has addressed not only in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71291 and 1292, but also in the Rules Enabling\nAct amendments to which the Court refers. See ante, at\n12\u201313 (citing \u00a7\u00a72072\u20132074). The Court recognizes that\nthese amendments \u201cdesignat[e] rulemaking, \u2018not expan\nsion by court decision,\u2019 as the preferred means of deter\nmining whether and when prejudgment orders should be\n2        MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v. CARPENTER\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nimmediately appealable.\u201d Ante, at 12 (quoting Swint,\nsupra, at 48). Because that designation is entitled to our\nfull respect, and because the privilege order here is not on\nall fours with orders we previously have held to be appeal\nable under the collateral order doctrine, see Cohen v.\nBeneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), I\nwould affirm the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment on the\nground that any \u201cavenue for immediate appeal\u201d beyond\nthe three avenues addressed in the Court\u2019s opinion must\nbe left to the \u201crulemaking process.\u201d Ante, at 13; see ante,\nat 9\u201312 (discussing certification under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71292(b), petitions for mandamus, and appeals from con\ntempt orders).\n   We need not, and in my view should not, further justify\nour holding by applying the Cohen doctrine, which\nprompted the rulemaking amendments in the first place.\nIn taking this path, the Court needlessly perpetuates a\njudicial policy that we for many years have criticized and\nstruggled to limit. See, e.g., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8); Will v. Hallock, 546 U. S.\n345, 349 (2006); Sell v. United States, 539 U.

The Court\u2019s choice of analysis is the\nmore ironic because applying Cohen to the facts of this\ncase requires the Court to reach conclusions on, and thus\npotentially prejudice, the very matters it says would bene\nfit from \u201cthe collective experience of bench and bar\u201d and\nthe \u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that rulemaking provides.\nAnte, at 13.\n   \u201cFinality as a condition of review is an historic charac\nteristic of federal appellate procedure\u201d that was incorpo\nrated in the first Judiciary Act and that Congress itself\nhas \u201cdeparted from only when observance of it would\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

S. 323, 324\u2013325 (1940). Until\n1949, this Court\u2019s view of the appellate jurisdiction statute\nreflected this principle and the statute\u2019s text. See, e.g.,\nCatlin v. United States, 324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945) (holding\nthat \u00a7128 of the Judicial Code (now 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291)\nlimits review to decisions that \u201cen[d] the litigation on the\nmerits and leav[e] nothing for the court to do but execute\nthe judgment\u201d). Cohen changed all that when it an\nnounced that a \u201csmall class\u201d of collateral orders that do\nnot meet the statutory definition of finality nonetheless\nmay be immediately appealable if they satisfy certain\ncriteria that show they are \u201ctoo important to be denied\nreview.\u201d 337 U. S., at 546.\n  Cohen and the early decisions applying it allowed \u00a71291\nappeals of interlocutory orders concerning the posting of a\nbond, see id., at 545\u2013547, the attachment of a vessel in\nadmiralty, see Swift & Co. Packers v. Compania Colombi\nana Del Caribe, S. A., 339 U. S. 684, 688\u2013689 (1950), and\nthe imposition of notice costs in a class action, see Eisen v.\nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 170\u2013172 (1974). As\nthe Court\u2019s opinion notes, later decisions sought to narrow\nCohen lest its exception to \u00a71291 \u201c \u2018 swallow\u2019 \u201d the final\njudgment rule.

The Court has ad\nhered to that narrowing approach, principally by raising\nthe bar on what types of interests are \u201cimportant enough\u201d\nto justify collateral order appeals. See, e.g., Will, supra, at\n352\u2013353 (explaining that an interlocutory order typically\nwill be \u201cimportant\u201d enough to justify Cohen review only\nwhere \u201csome particular value of a high order,\u201d such as\n\u201chonoring the separation of powers, preserving the effi\nciency of government . . . , [or] respecting a State\u2019s digni\ntary interests,\u201d is \u201cmarshaled in support of the interest in\navoiding trial\u201d and the Court determines that denying\n4         MOHAWK INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

As we recognized last Term,\nhowever, our attempts to contain the Cohen doctrine have\nnot all been successful or persuasive. See Ashcroft, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[A]s a general matter, the collateral\norder doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits\ndictated by its internal logic and the strict application of\nthe criteria set out in Cohen\u201d). In my view, this case pre\nsents an opportunity to improve our approach.\n   The privilege interest at issue here is undoubtedly\nimportant, both in its own right and when compared to\nsome of the interests (e.g., in bond and notice-cost rulings)\nwe have held to be appealable under Cohen. Accordingly,\nthe Court\u2019s Cohen analysis does not rest on the privilege\norder\u2019s relative unimportance, but instead on its effective\nreviewability after final judgment. Ante, at 8\u201312. Al\nthough I agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, I see\ntwo difficulties with this approach. First, the Court em\nphasizes that the alternative avenues of review it dis\ncusses (which did not prove adequate in this case) would\nbe adequate where the privilege ruling at issue is \u201cparticu\nlarly injurious or novel.\u201d Ante, at 9. If that is right, and it\nseems to me that it is, then the opinion raises the question\nwhy such avenues were not also adequate to address the\norders whose unusual importance or particularly injurious\nnature we have held justified immediate appeal under\nCohen. See, e.g., Sell, supra, at 177. Second, the facts of\nthis particular case seem in several respects to undercut\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that the benefits of collateral order\nreview \u201ccannot justify the likely institutional costs.\u201d Ante,\n                     Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nat 11.* The Court responds that these case-specific argu\nments miss the point because the focus of the Cohen\nanalysis is whether the \u201centire category\u201d or \u201cclass of\nclaims\u201d at issue merits appellate review under the collat\neral order doctrine. Ante, at 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That is exactly right, and illustrates what in\ncreasingly has bothered me about making this kind of\nappealability determination via case-by-case adjudication.\nThe exercise forces the reviewing court to subordinate the\nrealities of each case before it to generalized conclusions\nabout the \u201clikely\u201d costs and benefits of allowing an excep\ntion to the final judgment rule in an entire \u201cclass of cases.\u201d\nThe Court concedes that Congress, which holds the consti\ntutional reins in this area, has determined that such value\njudgments are better left to the \u201ccollective experience of\nbench and bar\u201d and the \u201copportunity for full airing\u201d that\nrulemaking provides. Ante, at 13. This determination is\nentitled to our full respect, in deed as well as in word.\nAccordingly, I would leave the value judgments the Court\nmakes in its opinion to the rulemaking process, and in so\ndoing take this opportunity to limit\u2014effectively, predicta\nbly, and in a way we should have done long ago\u2014the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * The Court concludes, for example, that in most cases final judgment\nreview of an erroneous privilege ruling will suffice to vindicate the\ninjured party\u2019s rights because the appellate court can vacate the\nadverse judgment and remand for a new trial in which the protected\nmaterial is excluded. Ante, at 8. But this case appears to involve one of\nthe (perhaps rare) situations in which final judgment review might not\nbe sufficient because it is a case in which the challenged order already\nhas had \u201cimplications beyond the case at hand,\u201d namely, in the sepa\nrate class action in Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., No. 4:04\u2013CV\u2013\n0003\u2013HLM (ND Ga.). Ante, at 11. The Court also concludes that the\n\u201clikely institutional costs\u201d of allowing collateral order review would\noutweigh its benefits because, inter alia, such review would \u201cneedlessly\nburden the Courts of Appeals.\u201d Ibid. But as the Court concedes, it\nmust speculate on this point because the three Circuits that allow\nCohen appeals of privilege rulings have not been overwhelmed.
