Argued October 7, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nThe Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act) was enacted to promote peaceful\n  and efficient resolution of labor disputes. As amended, the Act man\n  dates arbitration of \u201cminor disputes\u201d before panels composed of two\n  representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as\n  tiebreaker. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610\u2013613. To\n  supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Ad\n  justment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons rep\n  resenting labor and industry in equal numbers. 45 U. S. C. \u00a7153\n  First (a). Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers\n  must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining\n  agreement (hereinafter CBA), see \u00a7153 First (i), a stage known as\n  \u201con-property\u201d proceedings. As a final prearbitration step, the parties\n  must attempt settlement \u201cin conference\u201d between representatives of\n  the carrier and the grievant-employee. \u00a7152 Second, Sixth. The RLA\n  contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,\n  but does not \u201csupersede the provisions of any agreement (as to con\n  ferences) . . . between the parties,\u201d \u00a7152 Sixth; in common practice\n  the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation. If the\n  parties fail to achieve resolution, either may refer the matter to the\n  NRAB. \u00a7153 First (i). Submissions to the Board must include \u201ca full\n  statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the dis\n  putes.\u201d Ibid. Parties may seek court review of an NRAB panel order\n  on one or more stated grounds: \u201cfailure . . . to comply with the re\n  quirements of [the RLA], . . . failure of the order to conform, or con\n  2   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                          Syllabus\n\n  fine itself, to matters within the scope of the division\u2019s jurisdiction, or\n  . . . fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the or\n  der.\u201d \u00a7153 First (q). Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in\n  addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in \u00a7153\n  First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process viola\n  tions.\n      After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier)\n  charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union\n  (hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the\n  CBA. The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five dis\n  putes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.\n  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Un\n  ion sought arbitration before the NRAB\u2019s First Division. Both parties\n  filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferenc\n  ing as a disputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily\n  knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the\n  Board\u2019s governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes\n  Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to \u201cset forth all\n  relevant, argumentative facts,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d), (e). Just prior to\n  the hearing, one of the arbitration panel\u2019s industry representatives\n  objected, sua sponte, that the on-property record included no proof of\n  conferencing. The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection. The\n  referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing. The\n  Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue\n  was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected\n  before the date set for argument. The panel, in five identical deci\n  sions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction. The record\n  could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objec\n  tion, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was\n  not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments. The Un\n  ion sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the\n  Board\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the\n  \u201csingle question\u201d at issue was whether written documentation of the\n  conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to\n  NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequi\n  site in the statute or rules. But instead of resting its decision on the\n  Union\u2019s primary, statute-based argument\u2014that the panel erred in\n  ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases\u2014it reversed on the\n  ground that the NRAB\u2019s proceedings were incompatible with due\n  process.\nHeld:\n    1. The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Union\u2019s appeal under\n a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline. This Court\n granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nfor failure to comply with due process notwithstanding \u00a7153 First\n(q)\u2019s limited grounds for review. But so long as a respondent does not\n\u201cseek to modify the judgment below,\u201d true here, the respondent may\n\u201crely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the\njudgment.\u201d Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n. 5. The Seventh\nCircuit understood that the Union had pressed \u201cstatutory and consti\ntutional\u201d arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on\na \u201csingle question\u201d: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?\nAnswering this \u201csingle question\u201d in the negative, the Seventh Circuit\neffectively resolved the Union\u2019s core complaint. Because nothing in\nthe Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference\nminor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the\n\u201csingle question\u201d leaves no doubt about the Union\u2019s entitlement, in\naccord with \u00a7153 First (q), to vacation of the Board\u2019s orders. Given\nthis statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in\nthis case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be conse\nquential in another case. Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here\nenables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as\nBoard decisions, over matters properly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Pp. 10\u2013\n12.\n   2. Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting\nand processing claims, \u00a7153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the\nBoard\u2019s jurisdiction. By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on\nthe false premise that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to hear them, the NRAB\npanel failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress\nplaced] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7153 First (q).\nPp. 12\u201317.\n      (a) Not all mandatory \u201cprescriptions, however emphatic, \u2018are . . .\nproperly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510. Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended refers\nto a tribunal\u2019s \u201c \u2018power to hear a case,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018can never be forfeited or\nwaived.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 514. In contrast, a \u201cclaim-processing rule\u201d does not\nreduce a tribunal\u2019s adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily \u201cforfeited if\nthe party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\u201d Kon\ntrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456. For example, this Court has held\nnonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimina\ntion charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) before proceeding to court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. In contrast, the Court has reaffirmed the ju\nrisdictional character of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72107(a)\u2019s time limitation for fil\ning a notice of appeal. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209\u2013211.\nHere, the requirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last\n  4   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                          Syllabus\n\n  chance prearbitration, attempt settlement \u201cin conference,\u201d is imposed\n  on carriers and grievants alike, but satisfaction of that obligation\n  does not condition the Board\u2019s adjudicatory authority, which extends\n  to \u201call disputes between carriers and their employees \u2018growing out of\n  grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements\n  concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . ,\u2019 \u201d Slocum v.\n  Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240 (quoting \u00a7153 First (i)).\n  When a CBA\u2019s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to\n  the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the\n  conference requirement is independent of the CBA process. Rooted in\n  \u00a7152, the RLA\u2019s \u201c[g]eneral duties\u201d section, and not moored to the\n  NRAB\u2019s \u201c[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties\u201d set out in \u00a7153\n  First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more \u201cju\n  risdictional\u201d than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdic\n  tional and forfeitable in Zipes. And if the conference requirement is\n  not \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d then failure initially to submit proof of conferenc\n  ing cannot be of that genre. And although the Carrier alleges that\n  NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdic\n  tional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels\u2019 jurisdiction,\n  surely the panels themselves lack that authority. Furthermore,\n  NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter. Pp. 12\u201315.\n       (b) Neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to\n  require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, sub\n  mission of proof of conferencing. Instructions on party submissions\n  are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. The Board itself has\n  recognized that conferencing may not be a \u201cquestion in dispute,\u201d and\n  when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.\n  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented\n  \u201cdata\u201d supporting the employee\u2019s grievance, 29 CFR \u00a7301(d)\u2014\n  evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.\n  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.\n  Moreover, the RLA respects the parties\u2019 right to order for themselves\n  the conference procedures they will follow.

We have no more right to decline the exercise\nof jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is\nnot given.\u201d Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821);\nsee Marshall v. Marshall, 547 U. S. 293, 298\u2013299 (2006).\nWhile Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s statement bears \u201cfine\ntuning,\u201d there is surely a starting presumption that when\njurisdiction is conferred, a court may not decline to exer\u00ad\ncise it. See R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D.\nShapiro, Hart & Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the\nFederal System 1061\u20131062 (6th ed. 2009). The general\nrule applicable to courts also holds for administrative\nagencies directed by Congress to adjudicate particular\ncontroversies.\n   Congress vested in the National Railroad Adjustment\nBoard (hereinafter NRAB or Board) jurisdiction to adjudi\u00ad\n 2   UNION PACIFIC R.

C. \u00a7153\nFirst (h), (i). We consider in this case five nearly identical\ndecisions of a panel of the NRAB dismissing employee\nclaims \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction.\u201d NRAB First Div. Award\nNo. 26089 etc. (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n65a\u2013107a, 69a (hereinafter Panel Decision). In each case,\nthe panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a\npanel member, unprompted by the parties, was \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional\u201d in character and therefore commanded threshold\ndismissal.\n   The panel\u2019s characterization, we hold, was misconceived.\nCongress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the\npresentation and processing of claims, \u00a7153 First (v), but\nCongress alone controls the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. By pre\u00ad\nsuming authority to declare procedural rules \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d the panel failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB]\njurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7153 First (q). Because the panel was not\n\u201cwithout authority to assume jurisdiction over the [em\u00ad\nployees\u2019] claim[s],\u201d Panel Decision 72a, its dismissals\nlacked tenable grounding. We therefore affirm the judg\u00ad\nment of the Seventh Circuit setting aside the panel\u2019s\norders.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  Concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes\nbringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the Railway\nLabor Act (RLA or Act), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45\nU. S. C. \u00a7151 et seq., in 1926 to promote peaceful and\nefficient resolution of those disputes. See Union Pacific R.\nCo. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 609 (1959); \u00a7151a.

As part of\nits endeavor, Congress provided a framework for the\nsettlement and voluntary arbitration of \u201cminor disputes.\u201d\nSee Price, 360 U. S., at 609\u2013610. (In the railroad industry,\nthe term \u201cminor disputes\u201d means, primarily, \u201cgrievances\narising from the application of collective bargaining\nagreements to particular situations.\u201d Id., at 609.)1\n   Many railroads, however, resisted voluntary arbitration.\nSee id., at 610. Congress therefore amended the Act in\n1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor\ndisputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs\nbefore panels composed of two representatives of labor and\ntwo of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tie\u00ad\nbreaker. See id., at 610\u2013613. To supply the representa\u00ad\ntive arbitrators, Congress established the NRAB, a board\nof 34 private persons representing labor and industry in\nequal numbers. \u00a7153 First (a); see Trainmen v. Chicago R.\n& I. R. Co., 353 U. S. 30, 36\u201337 (1957).2 Neutral referees,\nthe RLA provides, shall be appointed by the representa\u00ad\ntive arbitrators or, failing their agreement, by the Na\u00ad\ntional Mediation Board. \u00a7153 First (l). The 1934 Amend\u00ad\nment authorized the NRAB to adopt, at a one-time session\nin 1934, \u201csuch rules as it deems necessary to control pro\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In  contrast to minor disputes, which assume \u201cthe existence of a\ncollective agreement,\u201d major disputes are those \u201cover the formation of\ncollective agreements or efforts to secure them. . . . They look to the\nacquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to\nhave vested in the past.\u201d Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U. S. 711,\n723 (1945).\n   2 The RLA divides the NRAB into four Divisions, each covering speci\u00ad\n\nfied classes of railroad employees. \u00a7153 First (h).\n  4   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v.

Congress did provide that an employee\nwho obtained a monetary award against a carrier could\nsue to enforce it, and the court could either enforce the\naward or set it aside. Price, 360 U.

The governing\nprovision, still in force, allows parties aggrieved by an\nNRAB panel order to petition for court review. 45 U. S. C.\n\u00a7153 First (q) (2006 ed.). The provision instructs that\n      \u201c[o]n such review, the findings and order of the divi\u00ad\n      sion shall be conclusive on the parties, except that the\n      order . . . may be set aside, in whole or in part, or re\u00ad\n      manded . . . , for failure of the division to comply with\n      the requirements of [the RLA], for failure of the order\n      to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the\n      scope of the division\u2019s jurisdiction, or for fraud or\n      corruption by a member of the division making the\n      order.\u201d\nCourts of Appeals have divided on whether this provision\nprecludes judicial review of NRAB proceedings for due\nprocess violations. Compare, e.g., Shaffi v. PLC British\nAirways, 22 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA2 1994) (review available),\nand Edelman v. Western Airlines, Inc., 892 F. 2d 839, 847\n(CA9 1989) (same), with Kinross v. Utah R.

Sheehan, 439 U. S. 89 (1978). That case in\u00ad\nvolved an NRAB decision turning on a time limitation contained in the\ngoverning CBA. Based on that limitation, the Board dismissed an\nemployee\u2019s claim. The Tenth Circuit remanded the case to the NRAB\non the ground that the Board had failed to consider the employee\u2019s\nequitable tolling argument and thereby violated due process. We\nsummarily reversed, observing that the Board had in fact considered\nthe plea for equitable tolling and explicitly rejected it. Id., at 92. We\nadded that if the Court of Appeals \u201cintended to reverse the [NRAB\u2019s]\nrejection of [the employee\u2019s] equitable tolling argument,\u201d then the court\nhad exceeded the bounds \u00a7153 First (q) placed on its review authority.\nId., at 93. In determining whether the CBA\u2019s time limitation was\ntolled, we said, the Board \u201ccertainly was acting within its jurisdiction\nand in conformity with . . . the Act.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

(hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its em\u00ad\nployees with disciplinary violations. Their union, the\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen\n(hereinafter Union), initiated grievance proceedings pur\u00ad\nsuant to the CBA. The Union asserts that, following\nexhaustion of grievance proceedings, the parties confer\u00ad\nenced all the disputes; counsel for the Carrier conceded at\nargument that at least two of the disputes were confer\u00ad\nenced, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Dissatisfied with the outcome of\nthe on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration\nbefore the First Division of the NRAB. The Union and the\nCarrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous\nsubmissions in the five cases. In each submission, the\nUnion included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the\nhearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating\nto the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance\nproceeding. Neither party mentioned conferencing as a\ndisputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessar\u00ad\nily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had con\u00ad\nferred, and the Board\u2019s governing rule instructs carriers\nand employees to \u201cset forth all relevant, argumentative\nfacts,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d), (e).\n   On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the\nemployees\u2019 claims, one of the industry representatives on\nthe arbitration panel raised an objection.

On his own initiative, unprompted by the\nCarrier, and in executive session, the industry representa\u00ad\ntive asserted that the on-property record included no proof\nof conferencing. See ibid. The Carrier thereafter em\u00ad\nbraced the panel member\u2019s objection. The neutral referee\ninformed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hear\u00ad\ning, allowing the Union \u201cto submit evidence that confer\u00ad\n  8   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nencing had in fact occurred.\u201d See id., \u00b6\u00b621\u201323. The Union\ndid so, offering phone logs, handwritten notes, and corre\u00ad\nspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing\nin each of the five cases. E.g., Panel Decision 67a\u201368a.\nFrom its first notice of the objection, however, the Union\nmaintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was un\u00ad\ntimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had\nnot objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.\nE.g., id., at 67a; Pet. to Review \u00b6\u00b622, 29, 30, 54.\n  On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of\nconferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical deci\u00ad\nsions, dismissed the petitions for want of \u201cauthority to\nassume jurisdiction over the claim[s].\u201d Panel Decision\n72a. Citing Circular One, see supra, at 3\u20134, and \u201cthe\nweight of arbitral precedent,\u201d the panel stated that \u201cthe\nevidentiary record\u201d must be deemed \u201cclosed once a Notice\nof Intent has been filed with the NRAB . . . .\u201d Panel Deci\u00ad\nsion 71a.5 In explaining why the record could not be sup\u00ad\nplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection,\nthe panel emphasized that it was \u201can appellate tribunal,\nas opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule\non de novo evidence and arguments.\u201d Id., at 69a.\n  The two labor representatives dissented. The Carrier\u2019s\nsubmissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on\nfailure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore,\nthey concluded, under a \u201cwell settled principle governing\nthe Board\u2019s deliberations,\u201d the Carrier had forfeited the\nissue. Id., at 105a\u2013106a.

Nothing in the\nAct or the NRAB\u2019s procedural rules, the Union main\u00ad\ntained, mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove\nconferencing in the Union\u2019s original submission. Id., \u00b6\u00b63,\n4. By imposing, without warrant, \u201ca technical pleading or\nevidentiary requirement\u201d and elevating it to jurisdictional\nstatus, the Union charged, the panel had \u201cegregiously\nviolate[d] the Act,\u201d id., \u00b63, or \u201cfail[ed] to conform its juris\u00ad\ndiction to that required by . . . law,\u201d id., \u00b64. Alternatively,\nthe Union asserted that the panel violated procedural due\nprocess by entertaining the Carrier\u2019s untimely objection,\neven though \u201cthe Carrier had failed to raise any objection\nas to lack of conferencing\u201d in its submissions. Id., \u00b65.\n  The District Court affirmed the Board\u2019s orders. Ad\u00ad\ndressing the Union\u2019s argument that the no-proof-of\u00ad\nconferencing issue was untimely raised, the court accepted\nthe panel\u2019s description of the issue as \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and\nnoted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional chal\u00ad\nlenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. 432\nF.

But\ninstead of resting its decision on the Union\u2019s primary,\nstatute-based argument\u2014that the panel erred in ruling\nthat it lacked jurisdiction over the cases\u2014the Court of\nAppeals reversed on the ground that the NRAB\u2019s proceed\u00ad\nings were incompatible with due process. See id., at 750.\n                             II\n  We granted the Carrier\u2019s petition for certiorari, 555\nU. S. ___ (2009), which asked us to determine whether a\nreviewing court may set aside NRAB orders for failure to\ncomply with due process notwithstanding the limited\ngrounds for review specified in \u00a7153 First (q).6 As earlier\nrecounted, Courts of Appeals have divided on this issue.\nSee supra, at 6, and n. 4. Appearing as respondent in this\nCourt, however, the Union urged affirmance of the Sev\u00ad\nenth Circuit\u2019s judgment on an alternative ground. Reas\u00ad\nserting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition\nfor court review, see supra, at 9, the Union maintained\nthat the Board did not \u201cconform, or confine itself, to mat\u00ad\nters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7153 First (q).\nBrief for Respondent 52\u201353.

Bacon, 457 U. S.\n132, 137, n. 5 (1982). The Seventh Circuit, as just ob\u00ad\nserved, see supra, at 9\u201310, understood that the Union had\npressed \u201cstatutory and constitutional\u201d arguments, but also\ncomprehended that both arguments homed in on \u201ca single\nquestion: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration\nbefore the NRAB?\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750. Answering this\n\u201csingle question\u201d in the negative, the Court of Appeals\neffectively resolved the Union\u2019s core complaint. But, for\nreasons far from apparent, the court declared that \u201conce\nwe answer the key question . . . , adjudication of the due\nprocess claim is unavoidable.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Seventh Circuit, we agree, asked the right question,\nbut inappropriately placed its answer under a constitu\u00ad\ntional, rather than a statutory, headline. As the Court of\nAppeals determined, and as we discuss infra, at 12\u201317,\nnothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the\nobligation to conference minor disputes or to prove confer\u00ad\nencing. That being so, the \u201cunavoidable\u201d conclusion,\nfollowing from the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \u201canswer [to] the key\nquestion,\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750, is that the panel, in \u00a7153\nFirst (q)\u2019s words, failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction.\u201d The Carrier,\nalthough it sought a different outcome, was quite right to\n\u201curg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory\nclaim before the constitutional one.\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750.\n   In short, a negative answer to the \u201csingle question\u201d\nidentified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about\nthe Union\u2019s entitlement, in accord with \u00a7153 First (q), to\nvacation of the Board\u2019s orders. Given this statutory\nground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this\ncase, and no warrant to answer a question that may be\nconsequential in another case: Absent grounds specified in\n  12 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n\u00a7153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing\ncourt set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility\nwith due process? An answer to that question must await\na case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.7 In\nthis case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to\naddress a matter of some importance: We can reduce\nconfusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over\nmatters properly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   Recognizing that the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d has been used\nby courts, including this Court, to convey \u201cmany, too\nmany, meanings,\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environ\nment, 523 U. S. 83, 90 (1998) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we have cautioned, in recent decisions, against\nprofligate use of the term. Not all mandatory \u201cprescrip\u00ad\ntions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d we explained in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sub\u00ad\nject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended, we em\u00ad\nphasized, refers to a tribunal\u2019s \u201cpower to hear a case,\u201d a\nmatter that \u201ccan never be forfeited or waived.\u201d Id., at 514\n(quoting United States v.

In contrast, a \u201cclaim-processing rule, . . . even if\nunalterable on a party\u2019s application,\u201d does not reduce the\nadjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily \u201cfor\u00ad\nfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise\nthe point.\u201d Kontrick v.

Rather, the conference\nrequirement is stated in the \u201c[g]eneral duties\u201d section of\nthe RLA, \u00a7152, a section that is not moored to the\n\u201c[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties\u201d of the NRAB\nset out next in \u00a7153 First. Rooted in \u00a7152 and often in\u00ad\nformal in practice, see supra, at 4\u20135, conferencing is surely\nno more \u201cjurisdictional\u201d than is the presuit resort to the\nEEOC held forfeitable in Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393.8 And if\nthe requirement to conference is not \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d then\nfailure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be\nof that genre. See Part III\u2013B, infra.\n   In defense of the Board\u2019s characterization of conferenc\u00ad\ning and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points\nto the NRAB\u2019s Circular One procedural regulations, see\nsupra, at 3\u20134, which provide: \u201cNo petition shall be consid\u00ad\nered by any division of the Board unless the subject mat\u00ad\nter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of\nthe [RLA].\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.2(b). But that provision, as\nother prescriptions in Circular One, is a claims-processing\nrule. Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules\nof jurisdictional dimension. See 45 U. S. C. \u00a7153 First (v)\n(authorizing the NRAB to \u201cadopt such rules as it deems\nnecessary to control proceedings before the respective\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The RLA states, in \u00a7152 First, a general duty \u201cto settle all disputes,\u201d\n\nand, in \u00a7152 Second, a more specific duty to \u201cconference.\u201d These provi\u00ad\nsions apply to all disputes in the railroad industry, major as well as\nminor. They also apply to disputes in the airline industry, over which\nthe NRAB has no jurisdiction. \u00a7181.

And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely\ncontested, we see no reason why the panel could not ad\u00ad\njourn the proceeding pending cure of any lapse. Circular\nOne does not exclude such a sensible solution.\n   The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support\ncharacterization of conferencing as jurisdictional. If the\nNRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its\npanels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that\nauthority. Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously\naddressed the matter. For example, in NRAB Third Div.\nAward No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although\ncharacterizing the conferencing requirement as \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d said that \u201c[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to\navail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to\ndo so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of juris\u00ad\ndiction.\u201d Id., at 2. See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No.\n5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No.\n28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same). Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U.

Award No. 23867, p. 5\n(Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary rem\u00ad\nedy for lack of conferencing is to \u201cdismiss th[e] claim with\u00ad\nout prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional\ndefect.\u201d That panel reached the merits nevertheless.

We note, in addition,\nthe acknowledgment of the Carrier\u2019s counsel that, if con\u00ad\nferencing has not occurred, NRAB panels have stayed\narbitration to allow the parties to confer.

Argued October 7, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nThe Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act) was enacted to promote peaceful\n  and efficient resolution of labor disputes. As amended, the Act man\n  dates arbitration of \u201cminor disputes\u201d before panels composed of two\n  representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee as\n  tiebreaker. Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U. S. 601, 610\u2013613. To\n  supply arbitrators, Congress established the National Railroad Ad\n  justment Board (NRAB or Board), a board of 34 private persons rep\n  resenting labor and industry in equal numbers. 45 U. S. C. \u00a7153\n  First (a). Before resorting to arbitration, employees and carriers\n  must exhaust the grievance procedures in their collective-bargaining\n  agreement (hereinafter CBA), see \u00a7153 First (i), a stage known as\n  \u201con-property\u201d proceedings. As a final prearbitration step, the parties\n  must attempt settlement \u201cin conference\u201d between representatives of\n  the carrier and the grievant-employee. \u00a7152 Second, Sixth. The RLA\n  contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences,\n  but does not \u201csupersede the provisions of any agreement (as to con\n  ferences) . . . between the parties,\u201d \u00a7152 Sixth; in common practice\n  the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation.

Courts of Appeals have divided on whether, in\n  addition to the statutory grounds for judicial review stated in \u00a7153\n  First (q), courts may review NRAB proceedings for due process viola\n  tions.\n      After petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier)\n  charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations, their union\n  (hereinafter Union) initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the\n  CBA. The Union asserts that the parties conferenced all five dis\n  putes and the Carrier concedes that they conferenced at least two.\n  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Un\n  ion sought arbitration before the NRAB\u2019s First Division. Both parties\n  filed submissions in the five cases, but neither mentioned conferenc\n  ing as a disputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily\n  knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred; and the\n  Board\u2019s governing rule, published in Circular One, which prescribes\n  Board procedures, instructs carriers and employees to \u201cset forth all\n  relevant, argumentative facts,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d), (e). Just prior to\n  the hearing, one of the arbitration panel\u2019s industry representatives\n  objected, sua sponte, that the on-property record included no proof of\n  conferencing. The Carrier thereafter embraced that objection. The\n  referee allowed the Union to submit evidence of conferencing. The\n  Union did so, but it maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue\n  was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier had not objected\n  before the date set for argument. The panel, in five identical deci\n  sions, dismissed the petitions for want of jurisdiction. The record\n  could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objec\n  tion, the panel reasoned, for as an appellate tribunal, the panel was\n  not empowered to consider de novo evidence and arguments. The Un\n  ion sought review in the Federal District Court, which affirmed the\n  Board\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Seventh Circuit observed that the\n  \u201csingle question\u201d at issue was whether written documentation of the\n  conference in the on-property record was a necessary prerequisite to\n  NRAB arbitration, and determined that there was no such prerequi\n  site in the statute or rules. But instead of resting its decision on the\n  Union\u2019s primary, statute-based argument\u2014that the panel erred in\n  ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases\u2014it reversed on the\n  ground that the NRAB\u2019s proceedings were incompatible with due\n  process.\nHeld:\n    1. The Seventh Circuit erred in resolving the Union\u2019s appeal under\n a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline. This Court\n granted certiorari to address whether NRAB orders may be set aside\n                    Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nfor failure to comply with due process notwithstanding \u00a7153 First\n(q)\u2019s limited grounds for review. But so long as a respondent does not\n\u201cseek to modify the judgment below,\u201d true here, the respondent may\n\u201crely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the\njudgment.\u201d Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n. 5. The Seventh\nCircuit understood that the Union had pressed \u201cstatutory and consti\ntutional\u201d arguments, but observed that both arguments homed in on\na \u201csingle question\u201d: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to NRAB arbitration?\nAnswering this \u201csingle question\u201d in the negative, the Seventh Circuit\neffectively resolved the Union\u2019s core complaint. Because nothing in\nthe Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference\nminor disputes or to prove conferencing, a negative answer to the\n\u201csingle question\u201d leaves no doubt about the Union\u2019s entitlement, in\naccord with \u00a7153 First (q), to vacation of the Board\u2019s orders. Given\nthis statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in\nthis case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be conse\nquential in another case. Nevertheless, the grant of certiorari here\nenables this Court to reduce confusion, clouding court as well as\nBoard decisions, over matters properly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Pp. 10\u2013\n12.\n   2. Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for presenting\nand processing claims, \u00a7153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the\nBoard\u2019s jurisdiction. By refusing to adjudicate the instant cases on\nthe false premise that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to hear them, the NRAB\npanel failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress\nplaced] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7153 First (q).\nPp. 12\u201317.\n      (a) Not all mandatory \u201cprescriptions, however emphatic, \u2018are . . .\nproperly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Arbaugh v.

In contrast, a \u201cclaim-processing rule\u201d does not\nreduce a tribunal\u2019s adjudicatory domain and is ordinarily \u201cforfeited if\nthe party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\u201d Kon\ntrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456. For example, this Court has held\nnonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964 requiring complainants to file a timely discrimina\ntion charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC) before proceeding to court, Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. In contrast, the Court has reaffirmed the ju\nrisdictional character of 28 U. S.

R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240 (quoting \u00a7153 First (i)).\n  When a CBA\u2019s grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to\n  the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature, but the\n  conference requirement is independent of the CBA process. Rooted in\n  \u00a7152, the RLA\u2019s \u201c[g]eneral duties\u201d section, and not moored to the\n  NRAB\u2019s \u201c[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties\u201d set out in \u00a7153\n  First, conferencing is often informal in practice, and is no more \u201cju\n  risdictional\u201d than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held nonjurisdic\n  tional and forfeitable in Zipes. And if the conference requirement is\n  not \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d then failure initially to submit proof of conferenc\n  ing cannot be of that genre. And although the Carrier alleges that\n  NRAB decisions support characterizing conferencing as jurisdic\n  tional, if the NRAB lacks authority to define its panels\u2019 jurisdiction,\n  surely the panels themselves lack that authority. Furthermore,\n  NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter.

Instructions on party submissions\n  are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. The Board itself has\n  recognized that conferencing may not be a \u201cquestion in dispute,\u201d and\n  when that is so, proof thereof need not accompany party submissions.\n  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented\n  \u201cdata\u201d supporting the employee\u2019s grievance, 29 CFR \u00a7301(d)\u2014\n  evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.\n  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.\n  Moreover, the RLA respects the parties\u2019 right to order for themselves\n  the conference procedures they will follow.

C. \u00a7153\nFirst (h), (i). We consider in this case five nearly identical\ndecisions of a panel of the NRAB dismissing employee\nclaims \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction.\u201d NRAB First Div. Award\nNo. 26089 etc. (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n65a\u2013107a, 69a (hereinafter Panel Decision). In each case,\nthe panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a\npanel member, unprompted by the parties, was \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional\u201d in character and therefore commanded threshold\ndismissal.\n   The panel\u2019s characterization, we hold, was misconceived.\nCongress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the\npresentation and processing of claims, \u00a7153 First (v), but\nCongress alone controls the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. By pre\u00ad\nsuming authority to declare procedural rules \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d the panel failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB]\njurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7153 First (q). Because the panel was not\n\u201cwithout authority to assume jurisdiction over the [em\u00ad\nployees\u2019] claim[s],\u201d Panel Decision 72a, its dismissals\nlacked tenable grounding. We therefore affirm the judg\u00ad\nment of the Seventh Circuit setting aside the panel\u2019s\norders.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  Concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes\nbringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the Railway\nLabor Act (RLA or Act), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45\nU.

As part of\nits endeavor, Congress provided a framework for the\nsettlement and voluntary arbitration of \u201cminor disputes.\u201d\nSee Price, 360 U. S., at 609\u2013610. (In the railroad industry,\nthe term \u201cminor disputes\u201d means, primarily, \u201cgrievances\narising from the application of collective bargaining\nagreements to particular situations.\u201d Id., at 609.)1\n   Many railroads, however, resisted voluntary arbitration.\nSee id., at 610. Congress therefore amended the Act in\n1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor\ndisputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs\nbefore panels composed of two representatives of labor and\ntwo of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tie\u00ad\nbreaker. See id., at 610\u2013613. To supply the representa\u00ad\ntive arbitrators, Congress established the NRAB, a board\nof 34 private persons representing labor and industry in\nequal numbers. \u00a7153 First (a); see Trainmen v. Chicago R.\n& I. R. Co., 353 U.

LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n           TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto state grounds on which both employees and railroads\ncould seek judicial review of NRAB orders. The governing\nprovision, still in force, allows parties aggrieved by an\nNRAB panel order to petition for court review. 45 U. S. C.\n\u00a7153 First (q) (2006 ed.). The provision instructs that\n      \u201c[o]n such review, the findings and order of the divi\u00ad\n      sion shall be conclusive on the parties, except that the\n      order . . . may be set aside, in whole or in part, or re\u00ad\n      manded . . . , for failure of the division to comply with\n      the requirements of [the RLA], for failure of the order\n      to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the\n      scope of the division\u2019s jurisdiction, or for fraud or\n      corruption by a member of the division making the\n      order.\u201d\nCourts of Appeals have divided on whether this provision\nprecludes judicial review of NRAB proceedings for due\nprocess violations. Compare, e.g., Shaffi v. PLC British\nAirways, 22 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA2 1994) (review available),\nand Edelman v. Western Airlines, Inc., 892 F. 2d 839, 847\n(CA9 1989) (same), with Kinross v. Utah R.

Sheehan, 439 U. S. 89 (1978). That case in\u00ad\nvolved an NRAB decision turning on a time limitation contained in the\ngoverning CBA. Based on that limitation, the Board dismissed an\nemployee\u2019s claim. The Tenth Circuit remanded the case to the NRAB\non the ground that the Board had failed to consider the employee\u2019s\nequitable tolling argument and thereby violated due process. We\nsummarily reversed, observing that the Board had in fact considered\nthe plea for equitable tolling and explicitly rejected it. Id., at 92. We\nadded that if the Court of Appeals \u201cintended to reverse the [NRAB\u2019s]\nrejection of [the employee\u2019s] equitable tolling argument,\u201d then the court\nhad exceeded the bounds \u00a7153 First (q) placed on its review authority.\nId., at 93. In determining whether the CBA\u2019s time limitation was\ntolled, we said, the Board \u201ccertainly was acting within its jurisdiction\nand in conformity with . . . the Act.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

(hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its em\u00ad\nployees with disciplinary violations. Their union, the\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen\n(hereinafter Union), initiated grievance proceedings pur\u00ad\nsuant to the CBA. The Union asserts that, following\nexhaustion of grievance proceedings, the parties confer\u00ad\nenced all the disputes; counsel for the Carrier conceded at\nargument that at least two of the disputes were confer\u00ad\nenced, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Dissatisfied with the outcome of\nthe on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration\nbefore the First Division of the NRAB. The Union and the\nCarrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous\nsubmissions in the five cases. In each submission, the\nUnion included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the\nhearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating\nto the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance\nproceeding. Neither party mentioned conferencing as a\ndisputed matter. Yet, in each case, both parties necessar\u00ad\nily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had con\u00ad\nferred, and the Board\u2019s governing rule instructs carriers\nand employees to \u201cset forth all relevant, argumentative\nfacts,\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d), (e).\n   On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the\nemployees\u2019 claims, one of the industry representatives on\nthe arbitration panel raised an objection.

On his own initiative, unprompted by the\nCarrier, and in executive session, the industry representa\u00ad\ntive asserted that the on-property record included no proof\nof conferencing. See ibid. The Carrier thereafter em\u00ad\nbraced the panel member\u2019s objection. The neutral referee\ninformed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hear\u00ad\ning, allowing the Union \u201cto submit evidence that confer\u00ad\n  8   UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND\n          TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nencing had in fact occurred.\u201d See id., \u00b6\u00b621\u201323. The Union\ndid so, offering phone logs, handwritten notes, and corre\u00ad\nspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing\nin each of the five cases. E.g., Panel Decision 67a\u201368a.\nFrom its first notice of the objection, however, the Union\nmaintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was un\u00ad\ntimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had\nnot objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.\nE.g., id., at 67a; Pet. to Review \u00b6\u00b622, 29, 30, 54.\n  On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of\nconferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical deci\u00ad\nsions, dismissed the petitions for want of \u201cauthority to\nassume jurisdiction over the claim[s].\u201d Panel Decision\n72a. Citing Circular One, see supra, at 3\u20134, and \u201cthe\nweight of arbitral precedent,\u201d the panel stated that \u201cthe\nevidentiary record\u201d must be deemed \u201cclosed once a Notice\nof Intent has been filed with the NRAB . . . .\u201d Panel Deci\u00ad\nsion 71a.5 In explaining why the record could not be sup\u00ad\nplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection,\nthe panel emphasized that it was \u201can appellate tribunal,\nas opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule\non de novo evidence and arguments.\u201d Id., at 69a.\n  The two labor representatives dissented. The Carrier\u2019s\nsubmissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on\nfailure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore,\nthey concluded, under a \u201cwell settled principle governing\nthe Board\u2019s deliberations,\u201d the Carrier had forfeited the\nissue. Id., at 105a\u2013106a. The dissenters urged that the\nUnion had furnished evidence showing \u201cthe cases had all\nbeen conferenced, even though the relevant Collective\nBargaining Agreement [did] not require [conferencing].\u201d\nId., at 105a.

Nothing in the\nAct or the NRAB\u2019s procedural rules, the Union main\u00ad\ntained, mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove\nconferencing in the Union\u2019s original submission. Id., \u00b6\u00b63,\n4. By imposing, without warrant, \u201ca technical pleading or\nevidentiary requirement\u201d and elevating it to jurisdictional\nstatus, the Union charged, the panel had \u201cegregiously\nviolate[d] the Act,\u201d id., \u00b63, or \u201cfail[ed] to conform its juris\u00ad\ndiction to that required by . . . law,\u201d id., \u00b64.

Id., \u00b65.\n  The District Court affirmed the Board\u2019s orders. Ad\u00ad\ndressing the Union\u2019s argument that the no-proof-of\u00ad\nconferencing issue was untimely raised, the court accepted\nthe panel\u2019s description of the issue as \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d and\nnoted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional chal\u00ad\nlenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2414172\"><a href=\"/opinion/2414172/blet-v-union-pacific-rr/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Appearing as respondent in this\nCourt, however, the Union urged affirmance of the Sev\u00ad\nenth Circuit\u2019s judgment on an alternative ground. Reas\u00ad\nserting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition\nfor court review, see supra, at 9, the Union maintained\nthat the Board did not \u201cconform, or confine itself, to mat\u00ad\nters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction,\u201d \u00a7153 First (q).\nBrief for Respondent 52\u201353.

Bacon, 457 U. S.\n132, 137, n. 5 (1982). The Seventh Circuit, as just ob\u00ad\nserved, see supra, at 9\u201310, understood that the Union had\npressed \u201cstatutory and constitutional\u201d arguments, but also\ncomprehended that both arguments homed in on \u201ca single\nquestion: is written documentation of the conference in the\non-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration\nbefore the NRAB?\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750. Answering this\n\u201csingle question\u201d in the negative, the Court of Appeals\neffectively resolved the Union\u2019s core complaint. But, for\nreasons far from apparent, the court declared that \u201conce\nwe answer the key question . . . , adjudication of the due\nprocess claim is unavoidable.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Seventh Circuit, we agree, asked the right question,\nbut inappropriately placed its answer under a constitu\u00ad\ntional, rather than a statutory, headline. As the Court of\nAppeals determined, and as we discuss infra, at 12\u201317,\nnothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the\nobligation to conference minor disputes or to prove confer\u00ad\nencing. That being so, the \u201cunavoidable\u201d conclusion,\nfollowing from the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \u201canswer [to] the key\nquestion,\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750, is that the panel, in \u00a7153\nFirst (q)\u2019s words, failed \u201cto conform, or confine itself, to\nmatters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction.\u201d The Carrier,\nalthough it sought a different outcome, was quite right to\n\u201curg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory\nclaim before the constitutional one.\u201d 522 F. 3d, at 750.\n   In short, a negative answer to the \u201csingle question\u201d\nidentified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about\nthe Union\u2019s entitlement, in accord with \u00a7153 First (q), to\nvacation of the Board\u2019s orders. Given this statutory\nground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this\ncase, and no warrant to answer a question that may be\nconsequential in another case: Absent grounds specified in\n  12 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n\u00a7153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing\ncourt set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility\nwith due process? An answer to that question must await\na case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.7 In\nthis case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to\naddress a matter of some importance: We can reduce\nconfusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over\nmatters properly typed \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   Recognizing that the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d has been used\nby courts, including this Court, to convey \u201cmany, too\nmany, meanings,\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environ\nment, 523 U. S. 83, 90 (1998) (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we have cautioned, in recent decisions, against\nprofligate use of the term. Not all mandatory \u201cprescrip\u00ad\ntions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d we explained in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S.\n500, 510 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sub\u00ad\nject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended, we em\u00ad\nphasized, refers to a tribunal\u2019s \u201cpower to hear a case,\u201d a\nmatter that \u201ccan never be forfeited or waived.\u201d Id., at 514\n(quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 630\n(2002)). In contrast, a \u201cclaim-processing rule, . . . even if\nunalterable on a party\u2019s application,\u201d does not reduce the\nadjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily \u201cfor\u00ad\nfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise\nthe point.\u201d Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 456 (2004).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 A case of that order would be uncommon. As the Carrier acknowl\u00ad\n\nedges, \u201cmany of the cases reviewing ostensibly extra-statutory due\nprocess objections could have been accommodated within the statutory\nframework.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 36. See also id., at 37 (\u201cThe statutory\nreview provisions are plainly generous enough to permit litigants to\nraise all of the simple, common, easily adjudicated, and likely to be\nmeritorious claims that sail under the flag of due process of law . . . .\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)             13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   For example, we have held nonjurisdictional and forfeit\u00ad\nable the provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., requiring complainants to\nfile a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Em\u00ad\nployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before pro\u00ad\nceeding to court. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455\nU. S. 385, 393 (1982). We have also held nonjurisdictional\nand forfeitable the Title VII provision exempting employ\u00ad\ners who engage fewer than 15 employees. Arbaugh, 546\nU. S., at 503, 515\u2013516. And we have determined that a\nChapter 7 trustee\u2019s (or creditor\u2019s) limited time to object to\nthe debtor\u2019s discharge, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004, is\na claim-processing, not a jurisdictional, matter. Kontrick,\n540 U. S., at 446\u2013447, 460. In contrast, relying on a long\nline of this Court\u2019s decisions left undisturbed by Congress,\nwe have reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of the time\nlimitation for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72107(a). Bowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205, 209\u2013211\n(2007). See also John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 130, 132 (2008) (court must consider\nsua sponte timeliness of lawsuit filed against the United\nStates in the Court of Federal Claims).\n   With these decisions in mind, we turn back to the re\u00ad\nquirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last chance\nprearbitration, attempt settlement \u201cin conference,\u201d 45\nU. S. C. \u00a7152 Second, Sixth. See supra, at 4\u20135, and n. 3.\nThis obligation is imposed on carriers and grievants alike\nbut, we hold, its satisfaction does not condition the adjudi\u00ad\ncatory authority of the Board.\n   The Board\u2019s jurisdiction extends to \u201call disputes between\ncarriers and their employees \u2018growing out of grievances or\nout of the interpretation or application of agreements\nconcerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . .\u2019 \u201d\nSlocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 240\n(1950) (quoting \u00a7153 First (i)). True, the RLA instructs\nthat, before any reference to arbitration, the dispute \u201cshall\n  14 UNION PACIFIC R. CO. v. LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS AND \n\n         TRAINMEN GEN. COMM. OF ADJUSTMENT \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nbe handled in the usual manner up to and including the\n[designated] chief operating officer.\u201d \u00a7153 First (i). And\nwhen the CBA\u2019s grievance procedure has not been fol\u00ad\nlowed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objection\u00ad\nable as premature.\n   The additional requirement of a conference, we note, is\nindependent of the CBA process. Rather, the conference\nrequirement is stated in the \u201c[g]eneral duties\u201d section of\nthe RLA, \u00a7152, a section that is not moored to the\n\u201c[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties\u201d of the NRAB\nset out next in \u00a7153 First. Rooted in \u00a7152 and often in\u00ad\nformal in practice, see supra, at 4\u20135, conferencing is surely\nno more \u201cjurisdictional\u201d than is the presuit resort to the\nEEOC held forfeitable in Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393.8 And if\nthe requirement to conference is not \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d then\nfailure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be\nof that genre. See Part III\u2013B, infra.\n   In defense of the Board\u2019s characterization of conferenc\u00ad\ning and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points\nto the NRAB\u2019s Circular One procedural regulations, see\nsupra, at 3\u20134, which provide: \u201cNo petition shall be consid\u00ad\nered by any division of the Board unless the subject mat\u00ad\nter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of\nthe [RLA].\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.2(b). But that provision, as\nother prescriptions in Circular One, is a claims-processing\nrule. Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules\nof jurisdictional dimension. See 45 U. S. C. \u00a7153 First (v)\n(authorizing the NRAB to \u201cadopt such rules as it deems\nnecessary to control proceedings before the respective\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The RLA states, in \u00a7152 First, a general duty \u201cto settle all disputes,\u201d\n\nand, in \u00a7152 Second, a more specific duty to \u201cconference.\u201d These provi\u00ad\nsions apply to all disputes in the railroad industry, major as well as\nminor. They also apply to disputes in the airline industry, over which\nthe NRAB has no jurisdiction. \u00a7181. Neither provision \u201cspeak[s] in\njurisdictional terms or refer[s] in any way to the jurisdiction of the\u201d\nNRAB. Zipes, 455 U. S., at 394.\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely\ncontested, we see no reason why the panel could not ad\u00ad\njourn the proceeding pending cure of any lapse. Circular\nOne does not exclude such a sensible solution.\n   The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support\ncharacterization of conferencing as jurisdictional. If the\nNRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its\npanels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that\nauthority. Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously\naddressed the matter. For example, in NRAB Third Div.\nAward No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although\ncharacterizing the conferencing requirement as \u201cjurisdic\u00ad\ntional,\u201d said that \u201c[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to\navail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to\ndo so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of juris\u00ad\ndiction.\u201d Id., at 2. See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No.\n5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No.\n28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same). Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at\n511 (\u201cunrefined\u201d uses of the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d are enti\u00ad\ntled to \u201cno precedential effect\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). And in NRAB First Div. Award No. 23867, p. 5\n(Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary rem\u00ad\nedy for lack of conferencing is to \u201cdismiss th[e] claim with\u00ad\nout prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional\ndefect.\u201d That panel reached the merits nevertheless. Ibid.\nCf. Steel Co., 523 U. S., at 94 (\u201cJurisdiction is power to\ndeclare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only\nfunction remaining to the [tribunal] is that of announcing\nthe fact and dismissing the cause\u201d (quoting Ex parte\nMcCardle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88034\"><a href=\"/opinion/88034/ex-parte-mccardle/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1869)).). We note, in addition,\nthe acknowledgment of the Carrier\u2019s counsel that, if con\u00ad\nferencing has not occurred, NRAB panels have stayed\narbitration to allow the parties to confer.

Circular One correspondingly instructs\nemployees seeking Board adjudication \u201c[to] set forth all\nrelevant, argumentative facts\u201d and \u201caffirmatively show the\nsame to have been presented to the carrier and made a\npart of the particular question in dispute.\u201d 29 CFR\n\u00a7301.5(d); see \u00a7301.5(e) (similar instruction addressed to\ncarriers). Conferencing, the Carrier urged, is a \u201crelevant,\nargumentative fac[t],\u201d so proof thereof must accompany\nparty submissions.\n   As earlier explained, see supra, at 14, instructions on\nparty submissions\u2014essentially pleading instructions\u2014are\nclaim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules. Moreover, the\nBoard itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a\n\u201cquestion in dispute.\u201d It has counseled parties submitting\njoint exhibits \u201cto omit documents that are unimportant\nand/or irrelevant to the disposition of the [case]; for exam\u00ad\nple . . . letters requesting a conference (assuming that is\nnot an issue in the dispute).\u201d NRAB Instructions Sheet,\nJoint Exh.

See supra, at 3; cf. Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2) (specifying sanctions, including dismissal, for\nfailure to comply with discovery orders); Rule 41(b) (authorizing invol\u00ad\nuntary dismissal for failure to prosecute or to comply with rules of\nprocedure or court orders). We also recognize that NRAB panels, in\nmanaging individual arbitrations, may prescribe and enforce reason\u00ad\nable procedural requirements.\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfile). It bears repetition here that neither the Union nor\nthe Carrier, in its submissions to the Board, identified\nconferencing as a \u201cquestion in dispute.\u201d See supra, at 7.\n   It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly\npresented \u201cdata . . . in support of [the] employee[\u2019s] [griev\u00ad\nance],\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7301.5(d)\u2014evidence the carrier had no\nopportunity to consider prearbitration. A contrary rule\nwould sandbag the carrier. But conferencing is not a fact\nbearing on the merits of a grievance. Indeed, there may be\nno disagreement at all about the occurrence of conferenc\u00ad\ning, as the Union believed to be the case here. Moreover,\nthe RLA respects the right of the parties to order for\nthemselves the conference procedures they will follow.\nSee 45 U. S. C. \u00a7152 Sixth (\u201c[N]othing in this chapter shall\nbe construed to supersede the provisions of any agreement\n(as to conferences) . . . in effect between the parties.\u201d). In\nsum, neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be\nread to require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB\u2019s exercise of\njurisdiction, submission of proof of conferencing.\n                        *     *    *\n   By refusing to adjudicate cases on the false premise that\nit lacked power to hear them, the NRAB panel failed \u201cto\nconform, or confine itself,\u201d to the jurisdiction Congress\ngave it. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
