KINDLER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 08\u2013992.      Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nRespondent Kindler was convicted of capital murder in Pennsylvania\n  state court, and the jury recommended a death sentence. Kindler\n  filed postverdict motions challenging his conviction and sentence, but\n  before the trial court could consider the motions or the jury\u2019s death\n  recommendation, Kindler escaped and fled to Canada. The state trial\n  court subsequently dismissed Kindler\u2019s postverdict motions because\n  of his escape. Canadian authorities ultimately captured Kindler and\n  held him in jail pending extradition. But before Kindler could be\n  transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again, this time re\n  maining at large for more than two years. He was eventually recap\n  tured and transferred to the United States. Once back in this coun\n  try, Kindler sought to reinstate his postverdict motions, but the trial\n  court denied relief, holding that the judge who had dismissed the mo\n  tions had not abused his discretion under Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive for\n  feiture law. Kindler argued on direct appeal that the trial court\n  erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions,\n  but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler\u2019s claims\n  were rejected on state habeas, and he sought federal habeas relief.\n  Under the adequate state ground doctrine, a federal habeas court will\n  not review a claim rejected by a state court \u201cif the decision of [the\n  state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the\n  federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d Coleman v.\n  Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. The District Court nonetheless\n  granted Kindler\u2019s habeas petition, determining that the state fugitive\n  forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review\n  of Kindler\u2019s habeas claims. The Third Circuit affirmed, and the\n  Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari. It argued that the Third\n2                         BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    Circuit had held the state fugitive forfeiture rule automatically in\n    adequate because the state courts had discretion in applying it, and\n    the Commonwealth sought review of that holding. The Court\n    granted that petition.\nHeld: A state procedural rule is not automatically \u201cinadequate\u201d under\n the adequate state ground doctrine\u2014and therefore unenforceable on\n federal habeas review\u2014because the state rule is discretionary rather\n than mandatory. The question whether a state procedural ruling is\n adequate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S.\n 362, 375. This Court has framed the adequacy inquiry by asking\n whether the state rule was \u201cfirmly established and regularly fol\n lowed.\u201d Id., at 376. A discretionary state procedural rule can serve\n as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review even if the ap\n propriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal\n claim in some cases but not others. A contrary holding would pose an\n unnecessary dilemma for the States: They could preserve flexibility\n by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at\n the cost of undermining the finality of state-court judgments. Or\n States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding\n such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in\n applying the rules. If forced to choose, many States would opt for\n mandatory rules to avoid the high costs of plenary federal review.\n That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are\n often desirable. The federal system, for example, often grants the\n trial judge broad discretion when his ringside perspective at the main\n event offers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking. The\n States have followed suit. Given the federalism and comity concerns\n motivating the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context,\n see Coleman, supra, at 730, this Court should not disregard discre\n tionary state procedural rules that are in place in nearly every State\n and are substantially similar to those given full force in federal\n courts.

Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729 (1991). We granted\ncertiorari to decide the following question: \u201cIs a state\nprocedural rule automatically \u2018inadequate\u2019 under the\nadequate-state-grounds doctrine\u2014and therefore unen\nforceable on federal habeas corpus review\u2014because the\nstate rule is discretionary rather than mandatory?\u201d Pet.\nfor Cert. i. Petitioners argue the correct answer is \u201cno.\u201d\nAt oral argument, respondent\u2014consistent with his posi\ntion below\u2014expressly agreed. We do too, and accordingly\nvacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n                          I\n  In 1982, Joseph Kindler, along with Scott Shaw and\nDavid Bernstein, burglarized a music store in Bucks\nCounty, Pennsylvania. Police stopped the getaway car\n2                   BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand arrested Shaw and Bernstein. In a harbinger of\nthings to come, Kindler escaped. Commonwealth v. Kin\ndler, 536 Pa. 228, 236, 639 A. 2d 1, 5, cert. denied, 513\nU. S. 933 (1994).\n  Police later arrested Kindler and charged him with\nburglary. He was released on bail. Bernstein agreed to\ntestify against Kindler, but Kindler had other plans. At\nabout 2:30 a.m. on July 25, 1982, Kindler and Shaw at\ntacked Bernstein outside his apartment. Kindler beat\nBernstein with a baseball bat approximately 20 times, and\nShaw shocked Bernstein 5 times with an electric prod.\nBernstein at that point was still alive but unable to move,\nand Kindler and Shaw dragged their victim to their\nnearby car, loaded him in the trunk, and drove to the\nDelaware River. At the river, Kindler tied a cinder block\naround Bernstein\u2019s neck and dumped him in the water. A\nforensic examiner later determined that Bernstein died of\ndrowning and massive head injuries. 536 Pa., at 236\u2013239,\n639 A. 2d, at 5\u20136.\n  Kindler was brought to trial and convicted of capital\nmurder. The jury recommended a death sentence, and\nKindler filed postverdict motions. Id., at 230\u2013231, 639\nA. 2d, at 2.\n  But on September 19, 1984, before the trial court could\nconsider the motions or the jury\u2019s death recommendation,\nKindler escaped. Ibid. In an organized effort to saw\nthrough the external prison bars with smuggled tools,\nKindler broke out of the maximum-security wing of the\nprison and headed for Canada. See Commonwealth v.\nKindler, 554 Pa. 513, 517\u2013518, and n. 4, 722 A. 2d 143,\n145, and n. 4 (1998).\n  Kindler remained a fugitive in Canada until April 26,\n1985, when he was arrested in Quebec for separate bur\nglary offenses. The United States sought Kindler\u2019s return,\nbut an extradition treaty allowed Canada to refuse to\nhand over anyone likely to face execution. See Kindler v.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCanada (Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S. C. R. 779.\n  Kindler turned into something of a local celebrity. He\neven appeared on Canadian television, explaining, among\nother things, how he had escaped and why he chose Can\nada: \u201cI knew there was no death penalty here.\u201d CTV\nNational News: Joseph Kindler\u2019s Fate Unresolved (Cana\ndian television broadcast Sept. 22, 1985) (videos available\nin Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). Canadian authorities ulti\nmately acquiesced to overtures from the United States and\nagreed to extradite Kindler. Kindler, supra, at 231, 639\nA. 2d, at 2.\n  But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian\ncustody, he escaped again. On the night of October 23,\n1986, Kindler broke through a skylight on the 13th floor of\nthe jail (his fellow inmates had hoisted him up to the\nskylight 15 feet above the floor) and escaped to the roof,\nwhere he stood 175 feet above ground. Armed with 13\nstories\u2019 worth of bedsheets tied together, Kindler safely\nrappelled down the side of the jail. (A fellow escapee was\nnot as lucky\u2014the sheets ripped on his way down, causing\nhim to fall 50 feet to his death.) Kindler, 554 Pa., at 517\u2013\n519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.\n  This time, Kindler remained on the lam for more than\ntwo years, until he was featured on the popular television\nshow, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d Characterizing Kindler\nas \u201can above average criminal\u201d and \u201ca chess player who\nunderstands when to make his move,\u201d the show asked\nviewers for information to help capture him. America\u2019s\nMost Wanted, Sept. 4, 1988, Season 1, Episode 30, at\n10:01. Several viewers recognized Kindler and notified\nCanadian authorities, who arrested him in September\n1988. 554 Pa., at 519, 722 A. 2d, at 145.\n  Kindler again fought extradition. On September 16,\n1991, after three years of litigation, the Supreme Court of\nCanada rejected Kindler\u2019s efforts. See Kindler, 2 S. C. R.\n779. That same day, Canadian officials extradited Kindler\n4                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto the United States. Kindler v. Horn, 291 F. Supp. 2d\n323, 334 (ED Pa. 2003).\n   In the meantime, in 1984, the Pennsylvania trial court\nhad dismissed Kindler\u2019s postverdict motions because of his\noriginal escape. Once back in the United States, Kindler\nfiled a motion to reinstate those challenges to his convic\ntion and sentence. The trial court denied the reinstate\nment motion, holding that the trial court judge who had\ndismissed the postverdict motions in 1984 had not abused\nhis discretion. In October 1991\u2014more than seven years\nafter the jury\u2019s death recommendation\u2014the court formally\nimposed the death sentence. Commonwealth v. Kindler,\nNo. 2747 etc. (Pa. Ct. Common Pleas, Feb. 28, 1992), App.\n66\u201370.\n   Kindler appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in\ndeclining to address the merits of his postverdict motions.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler, 536\nPa., at 232\u2013234, 639 A. 2d, at 3. That court recognized\nthat \u201ctrial courts, when faced with a defendant in fugitive\nstatus, . . . have every right to fashion an appropriate\nresponse[,] which can include the dismissal of pending\npost-verdict motions.\u201d Id., at 233, 639 A. 2d, at 3. The\ncourt then determined that the trial court\u2019s decision to\ndismiss Kindler\u2019s claims fell within its authority: The\n\u201cdismiss[al] [of] the post-verdict motions was a reasonable\nresponse to Appellant\u2019s \u2018flouting\u2019 of the authority of the\ncourt.\u201d Id., at 233\u2013234, 639 A. 2d, at 3. Under Pennsyl\nvania\u2019s fugitive forfeiture law, the court concluded, Kin\ndler\u2019s case therefore came to it \u201cwithout any allegations of\nerror (direct or collateral) preserved.\u201d Id., at 234, 639\nA. 2d, at 4.\n   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nonetheless con\nducted the \u201climited review\u201d mandated for death sentences\nunder Pennsylvania law. Under that review, the court\nwas required to confirm that the evidence was sufficient to\nsupport the conviction of first-degree murder and at least\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\none aggravating factor, and that the sentence was not\nexcessive, disproportionate, or the product of passion or\nprejudice. Id., at 234\u2013235, 639 A. 2d, at 4. Satisfied that\nKindler\u2019s conviction met these standards, the court af\nfirmed his conviction and sentence. We denied certiorari.\nKindler v. Pennsylvania, 513 U. S. 933 (1994).\n   On state habeas, the Court of Common Pleas rejected\nKindler\u2019s claims. That court held that the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court had already ruled that Kindler\u2019s escape\nforfeited all claims challenging his conviction and sentence\nthat Kindler may once have been entitled to bring. Com\nmonwealth v. Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (July 23, 1997), App.\n183, 187\u2013188. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.\nKindler, 554 Pa., at 514, 722 A. 2d, at 143.\n   Kindler then sought federal habeas relief. The District\nCourt determined that the fugitive forfeiture rule did not\nprovide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kin\ndler\u2019s habeas claims. 291 F. Supp. 2d, at 340\u2013343. The\nDistrict Court then proceeded to address the merits,\ngranting Kindler\u2019s petition on the grounds that he was\nsentenced based on jury instructions that were unconsti\ntutional under Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988),\nand that the prosecutor improperly introduced an aggra\nvating factor at sentencing. 291 F. Supp. 2d, at 346\u2013351,\n357\u2013358. The court rejected Kindler\u2019s ineffective assis\ntance of counsel claim. Id., at 356.\n   The Third Circuit affirmed. That court began by recog\nnizing that \u201c[a] procedural rule that is consistently applied\nin the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal\nhabeas review even if state courts are willing to occasion\nally overlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief\nwhere the rule would otherwise apply.\u201d Kindler v. Horn,\n542 F. 3d 70, 79 (2008). The Court of Appeals then con\nsidered the Pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place\nat the time of Kindler\u2019s first escape: \u201cPennsylvania courts\nhad discretion to hear an appeal filed by a fugitive who\n6                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been returned to custody before an appeal was initi\nated or dismissed. . . . Accordingly, the fugitive forfeiture\nrule was not \u2018firmly established\u2019 and therefore was not an\nindependent and adequate procedural rule sufficient to\nbar review of the merits of a habeas petition in federal\ncourt.\u201d Ibid. (citing Doctor v. Walters, 96 F. 3d 675, 684\u2013\n686 (CA3 1996)). The court thus determined that \u201cthe\nstate trial court still had discretion to reinstate his post\nverdict motions. Accordingly, we conclude that, under\nDoctor, Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive waiver law did not pre\nclude the district court from reviewing the merits of the\nclaims raised in Kindler\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d 542 F. 3d, at\n80. Turning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed\nwith the District Court on the improper aggravating factor\nclaim, but held that Kindler was entitled to relief based on\nhis Mills and ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 542\nF. 3d, at 80\u201387.\n   The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari, arguing\nthat the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that state discre\ntionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with\nthe holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted\nthis Court\u2019s review. Pet. for Cert. 6\u201311. Kindler coun\ntered that the Commonwealth had mischaracterized the\nThird Circuit\u2019s holding. Relying on the court\u2019s citation of\nthe Doctor opinion, Kindler argued that the Third Circuit\ndid not hold that discretionary state rules are automati\ncally inadequate; rather the court determined that the\nstate courts applied \u201ca new and different rule from that in\nexistence at the time of the alleged default.\u201d Brief in\nOpposition 3. It was that new rule, Kindler maintained,\nthat the Third Circuit found inadequate. Ibid.\n   We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for certiorari.\n556 U. S. ___ (2009). That petition asks us to decide\nwhether discretionary procedural rulings are automati\ncally inadequate to bar federal court review on habeas.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009) \n          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               II \n\n    The question whether a state procedural ruling is ade\nquate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534\nU. S. 362, 375 (2002). We have framed the adequacy\ninquiry by asking whether the state rule in question was\n\u201c \u2018firmly established and regularly followed.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 376\n(quoting James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341, 348 (1984)).\n    We hold that a discretionary state procedural rule can\nserve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.\nNothing inherent in such a rule renders it inadequate for\npurposes of the adequate state ground doctrine. To the\ncontrary, a discretionary rule can be \u201cfirmly established\u201d\nand \u201cregularly followed\u201d\u2014even if the appropriate exercise\nof discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim\nin some cases but not others. See Meltzer, State Court\nForfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1140\n(1986) (\u201c[R]efusals to exercise discretion do not form an\nimportant independent category under the inadequate\nstate ground doctrine\u201d).\n    A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma\nfor the States: States could preserve flexibility by granting\ncourts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at\nthe cost of undermining the finality of state court judg\nments. Or States could preserve the finality of their\njudgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the\ncost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules.\n    We are told that, if forced to choose, many States would\nopt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that come\nwith plenary federal review. See, e.g., Brief for State of\nCalifornia et al. as Amici Curiae 19; Brief for Criminal\nJustice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 14. That\nwould be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary\nrules are often desirable. In some circumstances, for\nexample, the factors facing trial courts \u201care so numerous,\nvariable and subtle that the fashioning of rigid rules\nwould be more likely to impair [the trial judge\u2019s] ability to\n8                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeal fairly with a particular problem than to lead to a just\nresult.\u201d United States v. McCoy, 517 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA7)\n(Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 895 (1975); see also\nFriendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J.\n747, 760\u2013761 (1982). The result would be particularly\nunfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the\nopportunity to argue that a procedural default should be\nexcused through the exercise of judicial discretion. See\nHenry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 463, n. 3 (1965)\n(Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf, in order to insulate its deci\nsions from reversal by this Court, a state court must strip\nitself of the discretionary power to differentiate between\ndifferent sets of circumstances, the [adequate state\nground] rule operates in a most perverse way\u201d).\n   It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that the federal system\noften grants broad discretion to the trial judge when his\nringside perspective at the \u201c \u2018main event\u2019 \u201d offers him a\ncomparative advantage in decisionmaking. Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90 (1977); cf. United States v. Poynter,\n495 F. 3d 349, 351\u2013352 (CA6 2007). The States seem to\nvalue discretionary rules as much as the Federal Govern\nment does. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici\nCuriae 16\u201317 (citing various state discretionary proce\ndural rules). In light of the federalism and comity con\ncerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in\nthe habeas context, see Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730, it\nwould seem particularly strange to disregard state proce\ndural rules that are substantially similar to those to which\nwe give full force in our own courts. Cf. Francis v. Hen\nderson, 425 U. S. 536, 541\u2013542 (1976). Even stranger to\ndo so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State,\nand all at one fell swoop.\n   We take our holding in this case to be uncontroversial\u2014\nso uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties agreed to the\npoint before this Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201331.\nRather than defending the question on which we granted\n                  Cite as: 558 U.

Such a mandatory\ndismissal, Kindler contends, constituted a break from past\ndiscretionary practice, and thus does not provide an ade\nquate state ground to bar his federal claims. We leave it\nto the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any\nothers Kindler may have preserved, on remand.\n  For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not only to\nreject a per se rule about discretionary rulings, but also to\nundertake \u201c[a] new effort to state a standard for inade\nquacy.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 25. Amici supporting the\nCommonwealth join in that request. See Brief for Crimi\nnal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6\u201310. We\ndecline that invitation as well. The procedural default at\nissue here\u2014escape from prison\u2014is hardly a typical proce\ndural default, making this case an unsuitable vehicle for\nproviding broad guidance on the adequate state ground\ndoctrine.\n  If our holding in this case is narrow, it is because the\nquestion we granted certiorari to decide is narrow. An\nswering that question is sufficient unto the day.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

KINDLER \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                      [December 8, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring.\n  Due consideration of the phrasing in the question pre\nsented and of the arguments and concessions by counsel\nleads to the conclusion that this case should be vacated\nand remanded, and I join the Court\u2019s opinion. The appar\nent difficulty the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nfound in accepting the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s\nprocedural bar conclusion, however, invites this further\ncomment.\n  The adequate state ground doctrine cannot be applied\nwithout consideration of the purposes it is designed to\nserve. By refraining from deciding cases that rest on an\nadequate and independent state ground, federal courts\nshow proper respect for state courts and avoid rendering\nadvisory opinions. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040\n(1983). The claimed adequate and independent state\nground at issue in this case is a state procedural rule. We\nhave not allowed state courts to bar review of federal\nclaims by invoking new procedural rules without adequate\nnotice to litigants who, in asserting their federal rights,\nhave in good faith complied with existing state procedural\nlaw. \u201cNovelty in procedural requirements cannot be per\nmitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those\n2                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nwho, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindi\ncation in state courts of their federal constitutional\nrights.\u201d NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.\n449, 457\u2013458 (1958). We have also been mindful of the\ndanger that novel state procedural requirements will be\nimposed for the purpose of evading compliance with a\nfederal standard. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.\nFlowers, 377 U. S. 288, 293\u2013302 (1964).\n   Neither of these concerns applies here. First, no one\ncould seriously entertain the notion that Kindler acted in\n\u201cjustified reliance\u201d when he fled beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe Pennsylvania courts. Even if a hypothetical escapee\nstudiously examined the case law before making an in\nformed decision that flight was worth it, that is not the\nreliance the law should be required to consider. There is\nno justification for an unlawful escape, which \u201coperates as\nan affront to the dignity of [a] court\u2019s proceedings.\u201d Or\ntega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234, 246 (1993).\nAnd if some prior court rulings allowed a former escapee\nto reinstate forfeited claims, there is no convincing reason\nto say a future escapee is entitled to similar treatment.\nNor is there any indication that the Supreme Court of\nPennsylvania adopted its forfeiture rule out of any hostil\nity toward legitimate constitutional claims.\n   It is most doubtful that, in light of its underlying pur\nposes, the adequate state ground doctrine ought to prevent\na State from adopting, and enforcing, a sensible rule that\nthe escaped felon forfeits any pending postverdict motions.\nThe law is entitled to protect the regularity and predict\nability of its own processes, and its own interest in the\nprompt adjudication of disputed issues, by imposing a rule\nof waiver quite without regard to some notion of express or\nconstructive reliance by the one who escapes. And if that\nprinciple had not been fully explicated in prior decisions, it\nseems to me that the State can establish a new baseline\nwithout later having its procedural bar ignored by the\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nfederal courts. This should be true even if the principles\nbarring the postverdict motions are first elaborated in the\ninstant case.\n  The process of elaborating, defining, and then shaping a\nState\u2019s decisional law after considering the competing\narguments in a specific case rests on this premise: Novel\nfacts and circumstances may disclose principles that,\nwhile consistent with the logic and rationality the law\nseeks and in that sense predictable, still have not yet been\ndefined with precision in earlier cases. This is the dy\nnamic of the case system we rely upon to explain the law.\n  The adequate state ground doctrine ought not to fore\nclose the case process in the separate States. A too\nrigorous or demanding insistence that procedural re\nquirements be established in all of their detail before they\ncan be given effect in federal court would deprive the\nStates of the case law decisional dynamic that the Judici\nary of the United States finds necessary and appropriate\nfor the elaboration of its own procedural rules. See, e.g.,\nSmith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876). Save where\nthere is exclusive jurisdiction or federal supremacy, a\nproper constitutional balance ought not give federal courts\nlatitude in the interpretation and elaboration of its law\nthat it then withholds from the States. There is no sense\nin applying the adequate state ground rule without its\nbeing informed by these principles.\n  Whether the structure of this case either permits or\nrequires consideration of these matters is not clear at this\nstage. In a proper case, however, these concerns should be\naddressed. It seems most doubtful that this Court can or\nshould require federal courts to disregard a state proce\ndural ground that was not in all respects explicit before\nthe case when it was first announced, absent a showing of\na purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees.\nAnd this is particularly so when the state procedural\nrequirement arose from the necessity, in new circum\n4                   BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nstances, to prevent a travesty of the State\u2019s own respected\nsystem. In this context, the objecting party ought not to\nhave the power to block federal courts from honoring\nstate-law determinations that were otherwise valid, en\nforceable, and consistent with constitutional guarantees.\n",

KINDLER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 08\u2013992.      Argued November 2, 2009\u2014Decided December 8, 2009\nRespondent Kindler was convicted of capital murder in Pennsylvania\n  state court, and the jury recommended a death sentence. Kindler\n  filed postverdict motions challenging his conviction and sentence, but\n  before the trial court could consider the motions or the jury\u2019s death\n  recommendation, Kindler escaped and fled to Canada. The state trial\n  court subsequently dismissed Kindler\u2019s postverdict motions because\n  of his escape. Canadian authorities ultimately captured Kindler and\n  held him in jail pending extradition. But before Kindler could be\n  transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again, this time re\n  maining at large for more than two years. He was eventually recap\n  tured and transferred to the United States. Once back in this coun\n  try, Kindler sought to reinstate his postverdict motions, but the trial\n  court denied relief, holding that the judge who had dismissed the mo\n  tions had not abused his discretion under Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive for\n  feiture law. Kindler argued on direct appeal that the trial court\n  erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions,\n  but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler\u2019s claims\n  were rejected on state habeas, and he sought federal habeas relief.\n  Under the adequate state ground doctrine, a federal habeas court will\n  not review a claim rejected by a state court \u201cif the decision of [the\n  state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the\n  federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d Coleman v.\n  Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729. The District Court nonetheless\n  granted Kindler\u2019s habeas petition, determining that the state fugitive\n  forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review\n  of Kindler\u2019s habeas claims. The Third Circuit affirmed, and the\n  Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari. It argued that the Third\n2                         BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    Circuit had held the state fugitive forfeiture rule automatically in\n    adequate because the state courts had discretion in applying it, and\n    the Commonwealth sought review of that holding. The Court\n    granted that petition.\nHeld: A state procedural rule is not automatically \u201cinadequate\u201d under\n the adequate state ground doctrine\u2014and therefore unenforceable on\n federal habeas review\u2014because the state rule is discretionary rather\n than mandatory. The question whether a state procedural ruling is\n adequate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534 U. S.\n 362, 375. This Court has framed the adequacy inquiry by asking\n whether the state rule was \u201cfirmly established and regularly fol\n lowed.\u201d Id., at 376. A discretionary state procedural rule can serve\n as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review even if the ap\n propriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal\n claim in some cases but not others. A contrary holding would pose an\n unnecessary dilemma for the States: They could preserve flexibility\n by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at\n the cost of undermining the finality of state-court judgments. Or\n States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding\n such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in\n applying the rules. If forced to choose, many States would opt for\n mandatory rules to avoid the high costs of plenary federal review.\n That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are\n often desirable. The federal system, for example, often grants the\n trial judge broad discretion when his ringside perspective at the main\n event offers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking. The\n States have followed suit. Given the federalism and comity concerns\n motivating the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context,\n see Coleman, supra, at 730, this Court should not disregard discre\n tionary state procedural rules that are in place in nearly every State\n and are substantially similar to those given full force in federal\n courts.

Once back in the United States, Kindler\nfiled a motion to reinstate those challenges to his convic\ntion and sentence. The trial court denied the reinstate\nment motion, holding that the trial court judge who had\ndismissed the postverdict motions in 1984 had not abused\nhis discretion. In October 1991\u2014more than seven years\nafter the jury\u2019s death recommendation\u2014the court formally\nimposed the death sentence. Commonwealth v. Kindler,\nNo. 2747 etc. (Pa. Ct.

Kindler, 536\nPa., at 232\u2013234, 639 A. 2d, at 3.

The\nDistrict Court then proceeded to address the merits,\ngranting Kindler\u2019s petition on the grounds that he was\nsentenced based on jury instructions that were unconsti\ntutional under Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988),\nand that the prosecutor improperly introduced an aggra\nvating factor at sentencing. 291 F. Supp. 2d, at 346\u2013351,\n357\u2013358. The court rejected Kindler\u2019s ineffective assis\ntance of counsel claim. Id., at 356.\n   The Third Circuit affirmed. That court began by recog\nnizing that \u201c[a] procedural rule that is consistently applied\nin the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal\nhabeas review even if state courts are willing to occasion\nally overlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief\nwhere the rule would otherwise apply.\u201d Kindler v. Horn,\n542 F. 3d 70, 79 (2008). The Court of Appeals then con\nsidered the Pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place\nat the time of Kindler\u2019s first escape: \u201cPennsylvania courts\nhad discretion to hear an appeal filed by a fugitive who\n6                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad been returned to custody before an appeal was initi\nated or dismissed. . . . Accordingly, the fugitive forfeiture\nrule was not \u2018firmly established\u2019 and therefore was not an\nindependent and adequate procedural rule sufficient to\nbar review of the merits of a habeas petition in federal\ncourt.\u201d Ibid. (citing Doctor v. Walters, 96 F. 3d 675, 684\u2013\n686 (CA3 1996)). The court thus determined that \u201cthe\nstate trial court still had discretion to reinstate his post\nverdict motions. Accordingly, we conclude that, under\nDoctor, Pennsylvania\u2019s fugitive waiver law did not pre\nclude the district court from reviewing the merits of the\nclaims raised in Kindler\u2019s habeas petition.\u201d 542 F. 3d, at\n80. Turning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed\nwith the District Court on the improper aggravating factor\nclaim, but held that Kindler was entitled to relief based on\nhis Mills and ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 542\nF. 3d, at 80\u201387.\n   The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari, arguing\nthat the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination that state discre\ntionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with\nthe holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted\nthis Court\u2019s review. Pet. for Cert. 6\u201311. Kindler coun\ntered that the Commonwealth had mischaracterized the\nThird Circuit\u2019s holding. Relying on the court\u2019s citation of\nthe Doctor opinion, Kindler argued that the Third Circuit\ndid not hold that discretionary state rules are automati\ncally inadequate; rather the court determined that the\nstate courts applied \u201ca new and different rule from that in\nexistence at the time of the alleged default.\u201d Brief in\nOpposition 3. It was that new rule, Kindler maintained,\nthat the Third Circuit found inadequate. Ibid.\n   We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for certiorari.\n556 U. S. ___ (2009). That petition asks us to decide\nwhether discretionary procedural rulings are automati\ncally inadequate to bar federal court review on habeas.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009) \n          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               II \n\n    The question whether a state procedural ruling is ade\nquate is itself a question of federal law. Lee v. Kemna, 534\nU. S. 362, 375 (2002). We have framed the adequacy\ninquiry by asking whether the state rule in question was\n\u201c \u2018firmly established and regularly followed.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 376\n(quoting James v. Kentucky, 466 U. S. 341, 348 (1984)).\n    We hold that a discretionary state procedural rule can\nserve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.\nNothing inherent in such a rule renders it inadequate for\npurposes of the adequate state ground doctrine. To the\ncontrary, a discretionary rule can be \u201cfirmly established\u201d\nand \u201cregularly followed\u201d\u2014even if the appropriate exercise\nof discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim\nin some cases but not others. See Meltzer, State Court\nForfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1140\n(1986) (\u201c[R]efusals to exercise discretion do not form an\nimportant independent category under the inadequate\nstate ground doctrine\u201d).\n    A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma\nfor the States: States could preserve flexibility by granting\ncourts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at\nthe cost of undermining the finality of state court judg\nments. Or States could preserve the finality of their\njudgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the\ncost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules.\n    We are told that, if forced to choose, many States would\nopt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that come\nwith plenary federal review. See, e.g., Brief for State of\nCalifornia et al. as Amici Curiae 19; Brief for Criminal\nJustice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 14. That\nwould be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary\nrules are often desirable. In some circumstances, for\nexample, the factors facing trial courts \u201care so numerous,\nvariable and subtle that the fashioning of rigid rules\nwould be more likely to impair [the trial judge\u2019s] ability to\n8                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeal fairly with a particular problem than to lead to a just\nresult.\u201d United States v. McCoy, 517 F. 2d 41, 44 (CA7)\n(Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 895 (1975); see also\nFriendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J.\n747, 760\u2013761 (1982). The result would be particularly\nunfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the\nopportunity to argue that a procedural default should be\nexcused through the exercise of judicial discretion. See\nHenry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 463, n. 3 (1965)\n(Harlan, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf, in order to insulate its deci\nsions from reversal by this Court, a state court must strip\nitself of the discretionary power to differentiate between\ndifferent sets of circumstances, the [adequate state\nground] rule operates in a most perverse way\u201d).\n   It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that the federal system\noften grants broad discretion to the trial judge when his\nringside perspective at the \u201c \u2018main event\u2019 \u201d offers him a\ncomparative advantage in decisionmaking. Wainwright v.\nSykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90 (1977); cf. United States v. Poynter,\n495 F. 3d 349, 351\u2013352 (CA6 2007). The States seem to\nvalue discretionary rules as much as the Federal Govern\nment does. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici\nCuriae 16\u201317 (citing various state discretionary proce\ndural rules). In light of the federalism and comity con\ncerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in\nthe habeas context, see Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730, it\nwould seem particularly strange to disregard state proce\ndural rules that are substantially similar to those to which\nwe give full force in our own courts. Cf. Francis v. Hen\nderson, 425 U. S. 536, 541\u2013542 (1976). Even stranger to\ndo so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State,\nand all at one fell swoop.\n   We take our holding in this case to be uncontroversial\u2014\nso uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties agreed to the\npoint before this Court. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29\u201331.\nRather than defending the question on which we granted\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncertiorari\u2014whether discretionary rules are automatically\ninadequate\u2014Kindler argues that the Pennsylvania courts\ndid not apply a discretionary rule at all, but instead ap\nplied a new rule mandating dismissal. Such a mandatory\ndismissal, Kindler contends, constituted a break from past\ndiscretionary practice, and thus does not provide an ade\nquate state ground to bar his federal claims. We leave it\nto the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any\nothers Kindler may have preserved, on remand.\n  For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not only to\nreject a per se rule about discretionary rulings, but also to\nundertake \u201c[a] new effort to state a standard for inade\nquacy.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 25. Amici supporting the\nCommonwealth join in that request. See Brief for Crimi\nnal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6\u201310. We\ndecline that invitation as well. The procedural default at\nissue here\u2014escape from prison\u2014is hardly a typical proce\ndural default, making this case an unsuitable vehicle for\nproviding broad guidance on the adequate state ground\ndoctrine.\n  If our holding in this case is narrow, it is because the\nquestion we granted certiorari to decide is narrow. An\nswering that question is sufficient unto the day.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

BEARD, SECRETARY, PENNSYLVANIA\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL.,\n\n      PETITIONERS v. JOSEPH J. KINDLER \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                      [December 8, 2009] \n\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring.\n  Due consideration of the phrasing in the question pre\nsented and of the arguments and concessions by counsel\nleads to the conclusion that this case should be vacated\nand remanded, and I join the Court\u2019s opinion. The appar\nent difficulty the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nfound in accepting the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s\nprocedural bar conclusion, however, invites this further\ncomment.\n  The adequate state ground doctrine cannot be applied\nwithout consideration of the purposes it is designed to\nserve. By refraining from deciding cases that rest on an\nadequate and independent state ground, federal courts\nshow proper respect for state courts and avoid rendering\nadvisory opinions. Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040\n(1983). The claimed adequate and independent state\nground at issue in this case is a state procedural rule. We\nhave not allowed state courts to bar review of federal\nclaims by invoking new procedural rules without adequate\nnotice to litigants who, in asserting their federal rights,\nhave in good faith complied with existing state procedural\nlaw. \u201cNovelty in procedural requirements cannot be per\nmitted to thwart review in this Court applied for by those\n2                    BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nwho, in justified reliance upon prior decisions, seek vindi\ncation in state courts of their federal constitutional\nrights.\u201d NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.\n449, 457\u2013458 (1958). We have also been mindful of the\ndanger that novel state procedural requirements will be\nimposed for the purpose of evading compliance with a\nfederal standard. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel.\nFlowers, 377 U. S. 288, 293\u2013302 (1964).\n   Neither of these concerns applies here. First, no one\ncould seriously entertain the notion that Kindler acted in\n\u201cjustified reliance\u201d when he fled beyond the jurisdiction of\nthe Pennsylvania courts. Even if a hypothetical escapee\nstudiously examined the case law before making an in\nformed decision that flight was worth it, that is not the\nreliance the law should be required to consider. There is\nno justification for an unlawful escape, which \u201coperates as\nan affront to the dignity of [a] court\u2019s proceedings.\u201d Or\ntega-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 234, 246 (1993).\nAnd if some prior court rulings allowed a former escapee\nto reinstate forfeited claims, there is no convincing reason\nto say a future escapee is entitled to similar treatment.\nNor is there any indication that the Supreme Court of\nPennsylvania adopted its forfeiture rule out of any hostil\nity toward legitimate constitutional claims.\n   It is most doubtful that, in light of its underlying pur\nposes, the adequate state ground doctrine ought to prevent\na State from adopting, and enforcing, a sensible rule that\nthe escaped felon forfeits any pending postverdict motions.\nThe law is entitled to protect the regularity and predict\nability of its own processes, and its own interest in the\nprompt adjudication of disputed issues, by imposing a rule\nof waiver quite without regard to some notion of express or\nconstructive reliance by the one who escapes. And if that\nprinciple had not been fully explicated in prior decisions, it\nseems to me that the State can establish a new baseline\nwithout later having its procedural bar ignored by the\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nfederal courts. This should be true even if the principles\nbarring the postverdict motions are first elaborated in the\ninstant case.\n  The process of elaborating, defining, and then shaping a\nState\u2019s decisional law after considering the competing\narguments in a specific case rests on this premise: Novel\nfacts and circumstances may disclose principles that,\nwhile consistent with the logic and rationality the law\nseeks and in that sense predictable, still have not yet been\ndefined with precision in earlier cases. This is the dy\nnamic of the case system we rely upon to explain the law.\n  The adequate state ground doctrine ought not to fore\nclose the case process in the separate States. A too\nrigorous or demanding insistence that procedural re\nquirements be established in all of their detail before they\ncan be given effect in federal court would deprive the\nStates of the case law decisional dynamic that the Judici\nary of the United States finds necessary and appropriate\nfor the elaboration of its own procedural rules. See, e.g.,\nSmith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876). Save where\nthere is exclusive jurisdiction or federal supremacy, a\nproper constitutional balance ought not give federal courts\nlatitude in the interpretation and elaboration of its law\nthat it then withholds from the States. There is no sense\nin applying the adequate state ground rule without its\nbeing informed by these principles.\n  Whether the structure of this case either permits or\nrequires consideration of these matters is not clear at this\nstage. In a proper case, however, these concerns should be\naddressed. It seems most doubtful that this Court can or\nshould require federal courts to disregard a state proce\ndural ground that was not in all respects explicit before\nthe case when it was first announced, absent a showing of\na purpose or pattern to evade constitutional guarantees.\nAnd this is particularly so when the state procedural\nrequirement arose from the necessity, in new circum\n4                   BEARD v. KINDLER\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nstances, to prevent a travesty of the State\u2019s own respected\nsystem. In this context, the objecting party ought not to\nhave the power to block federal courts from honoring\nstate-law determinations that were otherwise valid, en\nforceable, and consistent with constitutional guarantees.\n</pre>",
