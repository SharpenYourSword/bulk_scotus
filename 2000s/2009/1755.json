W. 2d 19 (2009). Because the decision\nof the Michigan Court of Appeals is indeed contrary to our\nFourth Amendment case law, particularly Brigham City v.\nStuart, 547 U. S. 398 (2006), we grant the State’s petition\nfor certiorari and reverse.\n   “[T]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment,”\nwe have often said, “is ‘reasonableness.’ ” Id., at 403.\nTherefore, although “searches and seizures inside a home\nwithout a warrant are presumptively unreasonable,” Groh\nv. Ramirez, 540 U. S. 551, 559 (2004) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), that presumption can be overcome. For\nexample, “the exigencies of the situation [may] make the\nneeds of law enforcement so compelling that the war\nrantless search is objectively reasonable.” Mincey v. Ari\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nzona, 437 U. S. 385, 393–394 (1978).\n   Brigham City identified one such exigency: “the need to\nassist persons who are seriously injured or threatened\nwith such injury.” 547 U. S., at 403. Thus, law enforce\nment officers “may enter a home without a warrant to\nrender emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to\nprotect an occupant from imminent injury.” Ibid. This\n“emergency aid exception” does not depend on the officers’\nsubjective intent or the seriousness of any crime they are\ninvestigating when the emergency arises. Id., at 404–405.\nIt requires only “an objectively reasonable basis for believ\ning,” id., at 406, that “a person within [the house] is in\nneed of immediate aid,” Mincey, supra, at 392.\n   Brigham City illustrates the application of this stan\ndard. There, police officers responded to a noise complaint\nin the early hours of the morning. “As they approached\nthe house, they could hear from within an altercation\noccurring, some kind of fight.” 547 U. S., at 406 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Following the tumult to the\nback of the house whence it came, the officers saw juve\nniles drinking beer in the backyard and a fight unfolding\nin the kitchen. They watched through the window as a\njuvenile broke free from the adults restraining him and\npunched another adult in the face, who recoiled to the\nsink, spitting blood. Ibid. Under these circumstances, we\nfound it “plainly reasonable” for the officers to enter the\nhouse and quell the violence, for they had “an objectively\nreasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult\nmight need help and that the violence in the kitchen was\njust beginning.” Ibid.\n   A straightforward application of the emergency aid\nexception, as in Brigham City, dictates that the officer’s\nentry was reasonable. Just as in Brigham City, the police\nofficers here were responding to a report of a disturbance.\nJust as in Brigham City, when they arrived on the scene\nthey encountered a tumultuous situation in the house—\n4                   MICHIGAN v. FISHER\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nand here they also found signs of a recent injury, perhaps\nfrom a car accident, outside. And just as in Brigham City,\nthe officers could see violent behavior inside. Although\nOfficer Goolsby and his partner did not see punches\nthrown, as did the officers in Brigham City, they did see\nFisher screaming and throwing things. It would be objec\ntively reasonable to believe that Fisher’s projectiles might\nhave a human target (perhaps a spouse or a child), or that\nFisher would hurt himself in the course of his rage. In\nshort, we find it as plain here as we did in Brigham City\nthat the officer’s entry was reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals, however, thought the\nsituation “did not rise to a level of emergency justifying\nthe warrantless intrusion into a residence.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">786515</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. Although the Court of Appeals conceded\nthat “there was evidence an injured person was on the\npremises,” it found it significant that “the mere drops of\nblood did not signal a likely serious, life-threatening in\njury.” Ibid. The court added that the cut Officer Goolsby\nobserved on Fisher’s hand “likely explained the trail of\nblood” and that Fisher “was very much on his feet and\napparently able to see to his own needs.” Ibid.\n   Even a casual review of Brigham City reveals the flaw\nin this reasoning. Officers do not need ironclad proof of “a\nlikely serious, life-threatening” injury to invoke the emer\ngency aid exception. The only injury police could confirm\nin Brigham City was the bloody lip they saw the juvenile\ninflict upon the adult. Fisher argues that the officers here\ncould not have been motivated by a perceived need to\nprovide medical assistance, since they never summoned\nemergency medical personnel. This would have no bear\ning, of course, upon their need to assure that Fisher was\nnot endangering someone else in the house. Moreover,\neven if the failure to summon medical personnel conclu\nsively established that Goolsby did not subjectively be\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

It does not meet the needs of law enforcement or\nthe demands of public safety to require officers to walk\naway from a situation like the one they encountered here.\nOnly when an apparent threat has become an actual harm\ncan officers rule out innocuous explanations for ominous\ncircumstances. But “[t]he role of a peace officer includes\npreventing violence and restoring order, not simply ren\ndering first aid to casualties.” Brigham City, supra, at\n406. It sufficed to invoke the emergency aid exception\nthat it was reasonable to believe that Fisher had hurt\nhimself (albeit nonfatally) and needed treatment that in\nhis rage he was unable to provide, or that Fisher was\nabout to hurt, or had already hurt, someone else. The\nMichigan Court of Appeals required more than what the\nFourth Amendment demands.\n                        *    *     *\n  The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

The charges were dismissed after the\ntrial judge granted a motion to suppress evidence of the\nassault because it was the product of Goolsby’s unlawful\nentry. In 2005 the Michigan Court of Appeals held that\nthe trial court had erred because it had decided the sup\npression motion without conducting a full evidentiary\nhearing. On remand, the trial court conducted such a\nhearing and again granted the motion to suppress.\n   As a matter of Michigan law it is well settled that police\nofficers may enter a home without a warrant “when they\nreasonably believe that a person within is in need of im\nmediate aid.” People v.

The State bears the burden of proof\non that factual issue and relied entirely on the testimony\nof Officer Goolsby in its attempt to carry that burden.\nSince three years had passed, Goolsby was not sure about\ncertain facts—such as whether Fisher had a cut on his\nhand—but he did remember that Fisher repeatedly swore\n2                   MICHIGAN v. FISHER\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nat the officers and told them to get a warrant, and that\nFisher was screaming and throwing things.

App., Mar.\n25, 2008) (per curiam) (summarizing Goolsby’s testimony),\nand that he did not ask whether anyone else was inside.\nGoolsby did not testify that he had any reason to believe\nthat anyone else was in the house. Thus, the factual\nquestion was whether Goolsby had “an objectively reason\nable basis for believing that [Fisher was] seriously injured\nor imminently threatened with such injury.” Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006).\n  After hearing the testimony, the trial judge was “even\nmore convinced” that the entry was unlawful. Tr. 29 (Dec.\n19, 2006). He noted the issue was “whether or not there\nwas a reasonable basis to [enter the house] or whether\n[Goolsby] was just acting on some possibilities,” id., at 22,\nand evidently found the record supported the latter rather\nthan the former. He found the police decision to leave the\nscene and not return for several hours—without resolving\nany potentially dangerous situation and without calling\nfor medical assistance—inconsistent with a reasonable\nbelief that Fisher was in need of immediate aid. In sum,\nthe one judge who heard Officer Goolsby’s testimony was\nnot persuaded that Goolsby had an objectively reasonable\nbasis for believing that entering Fisher’s home was neces\nsary to avoid serious injury.\n  The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding\nthat the State had not met its burden. Perhaps because\none judge dissented, the Michigan Supreme Court initially\ngranted an application for leave to appeal. After consider\ning briefs and oral argument, however, the majority of\nthat Court vacated its earlier order because it was “no\nlonger persuaded that the questions presented should be\nreviewed by this Court.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765 N.

The\nMichigan Court of Appeals required more than what the\nFourth Amendment demands.\n                        *    *     *\n  The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with\nthis opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

JEREMY FISHER\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF \n\n                 APPEALS OF MICHIGAN\n\n             No. 09–91. Decided December 7, 2009 \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\njoins, dissenting.\n   On October 31, 2003, Jeremy Fisher pointed a rifle at\nOfficer Christopher Goolsby when Goolsby attempted to\nforce his way into Fisher’s home without a warrant.\nFisher was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon\nand possession of a dangerous weapon during the commis\nsion of a felony. The charges were dismissed after the\ntrial judge granted a motion to suppress evidence of the\nassault because it was the product of Goolsby’s unlawful\nentry. In 2005 the Michigan Court of Appeals held that\nthe trial court had erred because it had decided the sup\npression motion without conducting a full evidentiary\nhearing. On remand, the trial court conducted such a\nhearing and again granted the motion to suppress.\n   As a matter of Michigan law it is well settled that police\nofficers may enter a home without a warrant “when they\nreasonably believe that a person within is in need of im\nmediate aid.” People v. Davis, 442 Mich. 1, 25, 497 N. W.\n2d 910, 921 (1993). We have stated the rule in the same\nway under federal law, Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385,\n392 (1978), and have explained that a warrantless entry is\njustified by the “ ‘need to protect or preserve life or avoid\nserious injury,’ ” ibid. The State bears the burden of proof\non that factual issue and relied entirely on the testimony\nof Officer Goolsby in its attempt to carry that burden.\nSince three years had passed, Goolsby was not sure about\ncertain facts—such as whether Fisher had a cut on his\nhand—but he did remember that Fisher repeatedly swore\n2                   MICHIGAN v. FISHER\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nat the officers and told them to get a warrant, and that\nFisher was screaming and throwing things. Goolsby also\ntestified that he saw “mere drops” of blood outside Fisher’s\nhome, No. 276439, 2008 WL 786515, *2 (Mich. App., Mar.\n25, 2008) (per curiam) (summarizing Goolsby’s testimony),\nand that he did not ask whether anyone else was inside.\nGoolsby did not testify that he had any reason to believe\nthat anyone else was in the house. Thus, the factual\nquestion was whether Goolsby had “an objectively reason\nable basis for believing that [Fisher was] seriously injured\nor imminently threatened with such injury.” Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 400 (2006).\n  After hearing the testimony, the trial judge was “even\nmore convinced” that the entry was unlawful. Tr. 29 (Dec.\n19, 2006). He noted the issue was “whether or not there\nwas a reasonable basis to [enter the house] or whether\n[Goolsby] was just acting on some possibilities,” id., at 22,\nand evidently found the record supported the latter rather\nthan the former. He found the police decision to leave the\nscene and not return for several hours—without resolving\nany potentially dangerous situation and without calling\nfor medical assistance—inconsistent with a reasonable\nbelief that Fisher was in need of immediate aid. In sum,\nthe one judge who heard Officer Goolsby’s testimony was\nnot persuaded that Goolsby had an objectively reasonable\nbasis for believing that entering Fisher’s home was neces\nsary to avoid serious injury.\n  The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding\nthat the State had not met its burden. Perhaps because\none judge dissented, the Michigan Supreme Court initially\ngranted an application for leave to appeal. After consider\ning briefs and oral argument, however, the majority of\nthat Court vacated its earlier order because it was “no\nlonger persuaded that the questions presented should be\nreviewed by this Court.” 483 Mich. 1007, 765 N. W. 2d 19\n(2009).\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  Today, without having heard Officer Goolsby’s testi\nmony, this Court decides that the trial judge got it wrong.\nI am not persuaded that he did, but even if we make that\nassumption, it is hard to see how the Court is justified in\nmicromanaging the day-to-day business of state tribunals\nmaking fact-intensive decisions of this kind. We ought not\nusurp the role of the factfinder when faced with a close\nquestion of the reasonableness of an officer’s actions,\nparticularly in a case tried in a state court. I therefore\nrespectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/1755/", "sha1": "599dab63abd38cd8f6610755fd914ffc620e3c89", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-005", "time_retrieved": "2010-04-15T12:40:18"}
