FERNANDO \n\n                BELMONTES, JR. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08\u20131263. Decided November 16, 2009\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   In 1981, in the course of a burglary, Fernando Belmon\ntes bludgeoned Steacy McConnell to death, striking her in\nthe head 15 to 20 times with a steel dumbbell bar. See\nPeople v. Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d 744, 759\u2013761, 755 P. 2d\n310, 315\u2013316 (1988). After the murder, Belmontes and his\naccomplices stole McConnell\u2019s stereo, sold it for $100, and\nused the money to buy beer and drugs for the night. Id.,\nat 764\u2013765, 755 P. 2d, at 318\u2013319.\n   Belmontes was convicted of murder and sentenced to\ndeath in state court. Unsuccessful on direct appeal and\nstate collateral review, Belmontes sought federal habeas\nrelief, which the District Court denied. The Court of Ap\npeals reversed, finding instructional error, but we over\nturned that decision. Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7\n(2006); see also Brown v. Belmontes, 544 U. S. 945 (2005).\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals again ruled for Bel\nmontes, this time finding that Belmontes suffered ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of\nhis trial. The District Court had previously denied relief\non that ground, finding that counsel for Belmontes had\nperformed deficiently under Ninth Circuit precedent, but\nthat Belmontes could not establish prejudice under Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Belmontes v.\nCalderon, Civ. S\u201389\u20130736 DFL JFM (ED Cal., Aug. 15,\n2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a, 179a, 183a. The Court\nof Appeals agreed that counsel\u2019s performance was defi\ncient, but disagreed with the District Court with respect to\n2                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nprejudice, determining that counsel\u2019s errors undermined\nconfidence in the penalty phase verdict. Belmontes v.\nAyers, 529 F. 3d 834, 859\u2013863, 874 (CA9 2008). We dis\nagree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the\nState\u2019s petition for certiorari, and reverse.\n                               I\n   Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally\nineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient\nmitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.\nTo prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the\ndeficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 687. To show deficient performance, Belmon\ntes must establish that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below\nan objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Id., at 688. In\nlight of \u201cthe variety of circumstances faced by defense\ncounsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding\nhow best to represent a criminal defendant,\u201d the perform\nance inquiry necessarily turns on \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s\nassistance was reasonable considering all the circum\nstances.\u201d Id., at 688\u2013689. At all points, \u201c[j]udicial scru\ntiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d\nId., at 689.\n   The challenge confronting Belmontes\u2019 lawyer, John\nSchick, was very specific. Substantial evidence indicated\nthat Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the\nprosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during\nthe penalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of\nthe prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness\ntestimony, Belmontes\u2019 own admissions, and Belmontes\u2019\npossession of the murder weapon and the same type of\nammunition used to kill the victim. Record 2239\u20132250,\n2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept.\n26, 1995).\n   The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.\nIt would have shown that two years before Steacy McCon\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nnell\u2019s death, police found Jerry Howard\u2019s body in a se\ncluded area. Howard had been killed execution style, with\na bullet to the back of the head. The authorities suspected\nBelmontes, but on the eve of trial the State\u2019s witnesses\nrefused to cooperate (Belmontes\u2019 mother had begged one\nnot to testify). The prosecution therefore believed it could\nnot prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. What the prosecution could prove, even without\nthe recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed\nthe gun used to murder Howard. So the State offered, and\nBelmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after\nthe fact to voluntary manslaughter. Record 2239\u20132243;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the\nmurder, boasting to several people that he had killed\nHoward. Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney\nthat Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police\ninformant told detectives that Belmontes \u201cbragged\u201d about\nthe murder, stating that he was \u201cmad\u201d at Howard because\n\u201cthe night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldn\u2019t\nshare it with him.\u201d After double jeopardy protection set in\nand he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted\nhis responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the\nCalifornia Youth Authority, Charles Sapien. During his\ntime in confinement, Belmontes had \u201calways denied that\nhe was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.\u201d But because\nSapien \u201chad been square with [Belmontes],\u201d Belmontes\ndecided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling\nSapien that he had \u201c \u2018wasted\u2019 that guy.\u201d Record 2240;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evi\ndence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the\noverriding need to exclude it. California evidentiary rules,\nSchick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the\nevidence, but those same rules made clear that the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door.\n4                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nRecord 2256; see also People v. Rodriguez, 42 Cal. 3d 730,\n791\u2013792, 726 P. 2d 113, 153 (1986); People v. Harris, 28\nCal. 3d 935, 960\u2013962, 623 P. 2d 240, 254 (1981). Schick\nthus had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that, even if he succeeded ini\ntially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still\nbe admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.\nAccordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, struc\nturing his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit\nthat possibility. Deposition of John Schick 301, 309\u2013310;\nsee Strickland, supra, at 699 (\u201cRestricting testimony on\nrespondent\u2019s character to what had come in at the plea\ncolloquy ensured that contrary character and psychologi\ncal evidence and respondent\u2019s criminal history, which\ncounsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come\nin\u201d).\n   As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit\nthis evidence during the sentencing phase. Schick moved\nto exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be\nallowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been\nconvicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary\nmanslaughter\u2014nothing more. Record 2240\u20132254. Schick\nsucceeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the\ndamaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his\nclient remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 2256.\n   This was not an empty threat. In one instance, Schick\nelicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent per\nson. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury,\nargued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with\nthe Howard murder evidence. Id., at 2332\u20132334. The\nCourt warned Schick that it was \u201cgoing to have to allow\n[the prosecution] to go into the whole background\u201d if\nSchick continued his line of questioning. Id., at 2334.\nSchick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.\nIbid.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n  The Court\u2019s warning reinforced Schick\u2019s understanding\nthat he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully\nto preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder\nevidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put\non nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for\nmitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder\nevidence. See id., at 2312\u20132417.\n  The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these\nefforts, Schick\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient\nunder Circuit precedent. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 862\u2013\n863. The State challenges that conclusion, but we need\nnot resolve the point, because we agree with the District\nCourt that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.\n                             II\n   To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show \u201ca reason\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\nferent.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. That showing\nrequires Belmontes to establish \u201ca reasonable probability\nthat a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigat\ning evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,\u201d\nand \u201cthat had the jury been confronted with this . . . miti\ngating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it\nwould have returned with a different sentence.\u201d Wiggins\nv. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535, 536 (2003).\n   The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably compe\ntent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evi\ndence, on top of what Schick had already presented. For\npurposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclu\nsion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that a jury presented with this additional miti\ngation evidence would have returned a different verdict.\n   In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider\nall the relevant evidence that the jury would have had\nbefore it if Schick had pursued the different path\u2014not just\n6                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but\nalso the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly\nwould have come in with it. See Strickland, supra, at\n695\u2013696, 700. Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes\nmust show a reasonable probability that the jury would\nhave rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire\nbody of mitigating evidence (including the additional\ntestimony Schick could have presented) against the entire\nbody of aggravating evidence (including the Howard mur\nder evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this burden.\n   We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did pre\nsent during the sentencing phase. That evidence was\nsubstantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the\nsame record in Belmontes\u2019 first habeas appeal agreed,\nrecognizing \u201cthe substantial nature of the mitigating\nevidence\u201d Schick presented. Belmontes v. Woodford, 350\nF. 3d 861, 907 (2003). It reiterated the point several\ntimes. See id., at 874, 901, 908.\n   All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a\nspan of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on\nBelmontes\u2019 behalf. A number of those witnesses high\nlighted Belmontes\u2019 \u201cterrible\u201d childhood. They testified\nthat his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.\nBelmontes\u2019 grandfather described the one-bedroom house\nwhere Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a\n\u201cchicken coop.\u201d Belmontes did not do well in school; he\ndropped out in the ninth grade. His younger sister died\nwhen she was only 10 months old. And his grandmother\ndied tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.\nSee Record 2314\u20132319, 2324\u20132325, 2344.\n   Family members also testified that, despite these diffi\nculties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with\nhis grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister. Id., at\n2317\u20132318, 2325\u20132326. And Belmontes\u2019 best friend of\nfered the insights of a close friend and confidant. Id., at\n2329\u20132332.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes\u2019\nreligious conversion while in state custody on the acces\nsory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmon\ntes\u2019 efforts advising other inmates in his detention center\u2019s\nreligious program, to illustrate that he could live a produc\ntive and meaningful life in prison. They described his\nsuccess working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his\nrise from lowest man on the team to second in command.\nBelmontes\u2019 assistant chaplain even said that he would use\nBelmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling pro\ngram if the jury handed down a life sentence. Id., at\n2379\u20132384, 2396\u20132398, 2400\u20132407.\n    Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying\nabout his childhood and religious conversion, both at\nsentencing and during allocution. Belmontes described\nhis childhood as \u201cpretty hard,\u201d but took responsibility for\nhis actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his\nbackground \u201cas a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now\n. . . because of that.\u201d Id., at 2343.\n    On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals\u2014\naddressing Belmontes\u2019 ineffective assistance claim for the\nfirst time\u2014changed its view of this evidence. Instead of\nfinding Schick\u2019s mitigation case \u201csubstantial,\u201d as it previ\nously had, Belmontes, 350 F. 3d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit\nthis time around labeled it \u201ccursory,\u201d Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 841, 861, n. 14, 866. Compare also Belmontes, 350\nF. 3d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence\nSchick presented \u201csubstantial\u201d), with Belmontes, 529\nF. 3d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence \u201cinsub\nstantial\u201d). More evidence, the Court of Appeals now con\ncluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more\nevidence to \u201chumanize\u201d Belmontes, as that court put it no\nfewer than 11 times in its opinion. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n. 18, 869, 872,\n874. The Court determined that the failure to put on this\nevidence prejudiced Belmontes.\n8                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of\nthe evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing\nevidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was\nalready there would have made little difference. Other\nevidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put\ninto play aspects of Belmontes\u2019 character that would have\ntriggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in\nrebuttal. This evidence would have made a difference, but\nin the wrong direction for Belmontes. In either event,\nBelmontes cannot establish Strickland prejudice.\n   First, the cumulative evidence. In the Court of Appeals\u2019\nview, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing\nevidence about Belmontes\u2019 \u201cdifficult childhood\u201d and high\nlighted his \u201cpositive attributes.\u201d 529 F. 3d, at 864. As for\nhis difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses\nto testify that \u201cwhen Belmontes was five years old, his 10\nmonth-old sister died of a brain tumor,\u201d that he \u201cexhibited\nsymptoms of depression\u201d after her death, that his grand\nmother suffered from \u201calcoholism and prescription drug\naddiction,\u201d and that both his immediate and extended\nfamily lived in a state of \u201cconstant strife.\u201d Ibid. As for his\npositive attributes, Schick should have produced testi\nmony about Belmontes\u2019 \u201cstrong character as a child in the\nface of adversity.\u201d Ibid. Schick should have illustrated\nthat Belmontes was \u201ckind, responsible, and likeable\u201d; that\nhe \u201cgot along well with his siblings\u201d and was \u201crespectful\ntowards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his\nmixed racial background\u201d; and that he \u201cparticipated in\ncommunity activities, kept up in school and got along with\nhis teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.\u201d\nIbid.\n   But as recounted above and recognized by the state\ncourts and, originally, this very panel, Schick did put on\nsubstantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the\nsame \u201chumanizing\u201d theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted.\nCompare, e.g., ibid., with Record 2317 (death of 10-month\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nold sister); id., at 2319, 2325 (difficult childhood); id., at\n2314\u20132315 (family member\u2019s addictions); id., at 2314\u2013\n2315, 2324\u20132325 (family strife and abuse); id., at 2317,\n2319, 2347\u20132348, 2397 (strong character as a child); id., at\n2326\u20132327 (close relationship with siblings); id., at 2317\u2013\n2319 (close relationship with grandparents); id., at 2348\u2013\n2351 (participation in community religious events); see\nalso, e.g., Belmontes\u2019 Traverse to Respondent\u2019s Return to\nPet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5\u201389\u20130736\u2013EJG\u2013\nJFM (ED Cal.), p. 64 (\u201c[C]ounsel\u2019s presentation was ar\nguably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of \u2018human\nizing\u2019 petitioner\u201d). The sentencing jury was thus \u201cwell\nacquainted\u201d with Belmontes\u2019 background and potential\nhumanizing features. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465,\n481 (2007). Additional evidence on these points would\nhave offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.\n   The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evi\ndence Schick presented and the additional evidence it\nproposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had\nsubmitted expert testimony. Such testimony could \u201cmake\nconnections between the various themes in the mitigation\ncase and explain to the jury how they could have contrib\nuted to Belmontes\u2019s involvement in criminal activity.\u201d\nBelmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 853. See also ibid. (discussing\nexpert\u2019s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert\ntestimony). But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth\nCircuit would have required Schick to present was neither\ncomplex nor technical. It required only that the jury make\nlogical connections of the kind a layperson is well\nequipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert\ntestimony to understand the \u201chumanizing\u201d evidence; it\ncould use its common sense or own sense of mercy.\n   What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes\u2019\nmental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it\nin some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes\nto the Howard evidence. See Darden v. Wainwright, 477\n10                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nU. S. 168, 186 (1986) (\u201cAny attempt to portray petitioner\nas a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the\nState to rebut with evidence of petitioner\u2019s prior convic\ntions. . . . Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to\nput on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they\nwould have been faced with his admission at trial that,\nalthough still married, he was spending the weekend\nfurlough with a girlfriend\u201d).\n   If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes\nhad a \u201c \u2018high likelihood of a . . . nonviolent adjustment to a\nprison setting,\u2019 \u201d as Belmontes suggested an expert might,\nsee Brief for Appellant in No. 01\u201399018 (CA9), p. 34, the\nquestion would have immediately arisen: \u201cWhat was his\npropensity toward violence to begin with? Does evidence\nof another murder alter your view?\u201d Expert testimony\nexplaining why the jury should feel sympathy, as opposed\nsimply to facts that might elicit that response, would have\nled to a similar rejoinder: \u201cIs such sympathy equally ap\npropriate for someone who committed a second murder?\u201d\nAny of this testimony from an expert\u2019s perspective would\nhave made the Howard evidence fair game.\n   Many of Belmontes\u2019 other arguments fail for the same\nreason. He argues that the jury should have been told\nthat he suffered an \u201cextended bout with rheumatic fever,\u201d\nwhich led to \u201cemotional instability, impulsivity, and im\npairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for plan\nning and reasoning.\u201d Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas\nCorpus 120. But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard\nmurder and Belmontes\u2019 subsequent bragging about it\nwould have served as a powerful counterpoint.\n   The type of \u201cmore-evidence-is-better\u201d approach advo\ncated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem\nappealing\u2014after all, what is there to lose? But here there\nwas a lot to lose.

The Court of Appeals went so far as to\nstate, without citation, that \u201c[t]here would be no basis for\nsuggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different\nif the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two\nmurders rather than one.\u201d Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 869,\nn. 20. But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testi\nmony \u201cexplain[ing] . . . involvement in criminal activity,\u201d\nid., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.\nAnd even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as\nthe Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that these two murders\nwere so different in character made each of them highly\npertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envi\nsioned by the Court of Appeals.\n   The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained\ndiscretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 869\u2013870, n. 20. If Schick had\ndoubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have\nsecured an answer in advance through a motion in limine.\nIbid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he\nstood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present\nthe evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge\nmade clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal\npurposes, id., at 2256, 2332\u20132334. When Schick elicited\ntestimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example,\nthe judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he\nwould admit the Howard murder evidence\u2014to let the\nprosecution \u201cgo into the whole background\u201d\u2014if Schick\npressed forward. Id., at 2334.\n   In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggrava\ntors, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the ag\ngravating evidence the State presented as \u201cscant.\u201d Bel\nmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 870, 873, 874, 875, 878. That\n12                 WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharacterization misses Strickland\u2019s point that the review\ning court must consider all the evidence\u2014the good and the\nbad\u2014when evaluating prejudice. See Strickland, 466\nU. S., at 695\u2013696, 700. Here, the worst kind of bad evi\ndence would have come in with the good. The only reason\nit did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation\ncase. The State\u2019s aggravation evidence could only be\ncharacterized as \u201cscant\u201d if one ignores the \u201celephant in the\ncourtroom\u201d\u2014Belmontes\u2019 role in the Howard murder\u2014that\nwould have been presented had Schick submitted the\nadditional mitigation evidence. Belmontes v. Ayers, 551\nF. 3d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).\n   Even on the record before it\u2014which did not include the\nHoward murder\u2014the state court determined that Belmon\ntes \u201cwas convicted on extremely strong evidence that he\ncommitted an intentional murder of extraordinary brutal\nity.\u201d Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.\nThat court also noted that \u201c[t]he properly admitted aggra\nvating evidence in this case\u2014in particular, the circum\nstances of the crime\u2014was simply overwhelming.\u201d Id., at\n809, 755 P. 2d, at 348 (citation omitted). The Ninth Cir\ncuit saw the murder differently. It viewed the circum\nstances of the crime as only \u201cconceivably significant\u201d as an\naggravating factor. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 871. In\nparticular, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]he\ncrime here did not involve . . . needless suffering on the\npart of the victim.\u201d Ibid.\n   We agree with the state court\u2019s characterization of the\nmurder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by\nthe Court of Appeals that this case did not involve \u201cneed\nless suffering.\u201d The jury saw autopsy photographs show\ning Steacy McConnell\u2019s mangled head, her skull crushed\nby 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found\nto have been wielded by Belmontes.

Belmontes left\nMcConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for\nher life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries\ncaused by the blows from Belmontes. Record 3. The jury\nalso heard that this savage murder was committed solely\nto prevent interference with a burglary that netted Bel\nmontes $100 he used to buy beer and drugs for the night.\nMcConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.\n  Some of the error below may be traced to confusion\nabout the appropriate standard and burden of proof.\nWhile the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language\nfrom Strickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might\nhave applied something different. In explaining its preju\ndice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201c[t]he\naggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence\nthat Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough,\nin light of the mitigating evidence that could have been\nadduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.\u201d Belmon\ntes, 529 F. 3d, at 875. But Strickland does not require the\nState to \u201crule out\u201d a sentence of life in prison to prevail.\nRather, Strickland places the burden on the defendant,\nnot the State, to show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the\nresult would have been different. 466 U. S., at 694. Un\nder a proper application of the Strickland standard, Bel\nmontes cannot carry this burden.\n  It is hard to imagine expert testimony and additional\nfacts about Belmontes\u2019 difficult childhood outweighing the\nfacts of McConnell\u2019s murder. It becomes even harder to\nenvision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes\nhad committed another murder\u2014\u201cthe most powerful\nimaginable aggravating evidence,\u201d as Judge Levi put it,\nBelmontes, S-89\u20130736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a\u2014is\nadded to the mix.

See Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7,\n27 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The trial judge who\npresided at Belmontes\u2019 sentencing hearing so understood\nthe law, and his instructions to the jury reflected that\nunderstanding. See id., at 33\u201334. It was only later that\nboth the California Supreme Court and this Court\nsquarely held that a jury must be allowed to give weight to\nany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or history that may\nprovide a basis for a sentence other than death, even if\nsuch evidence does not \u201c \u2018tend to reduce the defendant\u2019s\nculpability for his crime.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 28 (quoting Skipper v.\nSouth Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 11 (1986) (Powell, J., concur\nring in judgment)).\n  The testimony adduced at Belmontes\u2019 sentencing hear\ning described his religious conversion and his positive\ncontributions to a youth rehabilitation program. Neither\nhis own testimony, nor that of the two ministers and the\nother witnesses who testified on his behalf, made any\nattempt to extenuate the severity of his crime. Their\ntestimony did, however, afford the jury a principled basis\nfor imposing a sentence other than death. See Ayers, 549\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * Cal.

A review of the\nentire record, especially the colloquy between six jurors\nand the trial judge, makes it clear to me that \u201cthe jury\nbelieved that the law forbade it from giving that evidence\nany weight at all.\u201d Id., at 36\u201339. I therefore remain con\nvinced that in its initial review of this case, the Court of\nAppeals correctly set aside Belmontes\u2019 death sentence.\n   The narrow question that is now before us is whether\nthe additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel failed\nto uncover would have persuaded the jury to return a\ndifferent verdict. The evidence trial counsel might have\npresented hardly matters, however, because in my view\nthe conscientious jurors\u2019 mistaken understanding of the\nlaw would have prevented them from giving that addi\ntional evidence \u201cany weight at all,\u201d id., at 39, let alone\ncontrolling weight. Despite my strong disagreement with\nthe Court\u2019s decision to review this case once again, I nev\nertheless agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that trial\ncounsel\u2019s failure to present additional mitigating evidence\nprobably did not affect the outcome of the trial.\n",

Belmontes v.\nAyers, 529 F. 3d 834, 859\u2013863, 874 (CA9 2008). We dis\nagree with the Court of Appeals as to prejudice, grant the\nState\u2019s petition for certiorari, and reverse.\n                               I\n   Belmontes argues that his counsel was constitutionally\nineffective for failing to investigate and present sufficient\nmitigating evidence during the penalty phase of his trial.\nTo prevail on this claim, Belmontes must meet both the\ndeficient performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland,\n466 U. S., at 687. To show deficient performance, Belmon\ntes must establish that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below\nan objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Id., at 688. In\nlight of \u201cthe variety of circumstances faced by defense\ncounsel [and] the range of legitimate decisions regarding\nhow best to represent a criminal defendant,\u201d the perform\nance inquiry necessarily turns on \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s\nassistance was reasonable considering all the circum\nstances.\u201d Id., at 688\u2013689. At all points, \u201c[j]udicial scru\ntiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d\nId., at 689.\n   The challenge confronting Belmontes\u2019 lawyer, John\nSchick, was very specific. Substantial evidence indicated\nthat Belmontes had committed a prior murder, and the\nprosecution was eager to introduce that evidence during\nthe penalty phase of the McConnell trial. The evidence of\nthe prior murder was extensive, including eyewitness\ntestimony, Belmontes\u2019 own admissions, and Belmontes\u2019\npossession of the murder weapon and the same type of\nammunition used to kill the victim. Record 2239\u20132250,\n2261; Deposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64 (Sept.\n26, 1995).\n   The evidence, furthermore, was potentially devastating.\nIt would have shown that two years before Steacy McCon\n                 Cite as: 558 U.

Howard had been killed execution style, with\na bullet to the back of the head. The authorities suspected\nBelmontes, but on the eve of trial the State\u2019s witnesses\nrefused to cooperate (Belmontes\u2019 mother had begged one\nnot to testify). The prosecution therefore believed it could\nnot prove Belmontes guilty of murder beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. What the prosecution could prove, even without\nthe recalcitrant witnesses, was that Belmontes possessed\nthe gun used to murder Howard. So the State offered, and\nBelmontes accepted, a no-contest plea to accessory after\nthe fact to voluntary manslaughter. Record 2239\u20132243;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  But Belmontes had not been shy about discussing the\nmurder, boasting to several people that he had killed\nHoward. Steven Cartwright informed the district attorney\nthat Belmontes had confessed to the murder. A police\ninformant told detectives that Belmontes \u201cbragged\u201d about\nthe murder, stating that he was \u201cmad\u201d at Howard because\n\u201cthe night before, he had quite a [lot] of dope and wouldn\u2019t\nshare it with him.\u201d After double jeopardy protection set in\nand he had been released on parole, Belmontes admitted\nhis responsibility for the murder to his counselor at the\nCalifornia Youth Authority, Charles Sapien. During his\ntime in confinement, Belmontes had \u201calways denied that\nhe was the [one] who shot Jerry Howard.\u201d But because\nSapien \u201chad been square with [Belmontes],\u201d Belmontes\ndecided to level with Sapien upon his release, telling\nSapien that he had \u201c \u2018wasted\u2019 that guy.\u201d Record 2240;\nDeposition of John Schick, Exhs. 62, 63, 64.\n  Schick understood the gravity of this aggravating evi\ndence, and he built his mitigation strategy around the\noverriding need to exclude it. California evidentiary rules,\nSchick knew, offered him an argument to exclude the\nevidence, but those same rules made clear that the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal if Schick opened the door.\n4                   WONG v.

Schick\nthus had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that, even if he succeeded ini\ntially in excluding the prior murder evidence, it would still\nbe admitted if his mitigation case swept too broadly.\nAccordingly, Schick decided to proceed cautiously, struc\nturing his mitigation arguments and witnesses to limit\nthat possibility. Deposition of John Schick 301, 309\u2013310;\nsee Strickland, supra, at 699 (\u201cRestricting testimony on\nrespondent\u2019s character to what had come in at the plea\ncolloquy ensured that contrary character and psychologi\ncal evidence and respondent\u2019s criminal history, which\ncounsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not come\nin\u201d).\n   As Schick expected, the prosecution was ready to admit\nthis evidence during the sentencing phase. Schick moved\nto exclude the evidence, arguing that the State should be\nallowed to tell the jury only that Belmontes had been\nconvicted of being an accessory after the fact to voluntary\nmanslaughter\u2014nothing more. Record 2240\u20132254. Schick\nsucceeded in keeping the prosecution from presenting the\ndamaging evidence in its sentencing case in chief, but his\nclient remained at risk: The trial court indicated the evi\ndence would come in for rebuttal or impeachment if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 2256.\n   This was not an empty threat. In one instance, Schick\nelicited testimony that Belmontes was not a violent per\nson. The State objected and, out of earshot of the jury,\nargued that it should be able to rebut the testimony with\nthe Howard murder evidence. Id., at 2332\u20132334. The\nCourt warned Schick that it was \u201cgoing to have to allow\n[the prosecution] to go into the whole background\u201d if\nSchick continued his line of questioning. Id., at 2334.\nSchick acquiesced, and the court struck the testimony.\nIbid.\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n  The Court\u2019s warning reinforced Schick\u2019s understanding\nthat he would have to tailor his mitigation case carefully\nto preserve his success in excluding the Howard murder\nevidence. With that cautionary note in mind, Schick put\non nine witnesses he thought could advance a case for\nmitigation, without opening the door to the prior murder\nevidence. See id., at 2312\u20132417.\n  The Court of Appeals determined that in spite of these\nefforts, Schick\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient\nunder Circuit precedent. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 862\u2013\n863. The State challenges that conclusion, but we need\nnot resolve the point, because we agree with the District\nCourt that Belmontes cannot establish prejudice.\n                             II\n   To establish prejudice, Belmontes must show \u201ca reason\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\nferent.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. That showing\nrequires Belmontes to establish \u201ca reasonable probability\nthat a competent attorney, aware of [the available mitigat\ning evidence], would have introduced it at sentencing,\u201d\nand \u201cthat had the jury been confronted with this . . . miti\ngating evidence, there is a reasonable probability that it\nwould have returned with a different sentence.\u201d Wiggins\nv. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535, 536 (2003).\n   The Ninth Circuit determined that a reasonably compe\ntent lawyer would have introduced more mitigation evi\ndence, on top of what Schick had already presented. For\npurposes of our prejudice analysis, we accept that conclu\nsion and proceed to consider whether there is a reasonable\nprobability that a jury presented with this additional miti\ngation evidence would have returned a different verdict.\n   In evaluating that question, it is necessary to consider\nall the relevant evidence that the jury would have had\nbefore it if Schick had pursued the different path\u2014not just\n6                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthe mitigation evidence Schick could have presented, but\nalso the Howard murder evidence that almost certainly\nwould have come in with it. See Strickland, supra, at\n695\u2013696, 700. Thus, to establish prejudice, Belmontes\nmust show a reasonable probability that the jury would\nhave rejected a capital sentence after it weighed the entire\nbody of mitigating evidence (including the additional\ntestimony Schick could have presented) against the entire\nbody of aggravating evidence (including the Howard mur\nder evidence). Belmontes cannot meet this burden.\n   We begin with the mitigating evidence Schick did pre\nsent during the sentencing phase. That evidence was\nsubstantial. The same Ninth Circuit panel addressing the\nsame record in Belmontes\u2019 first habeas appeal agreed,\nrecognizing \u201cthe substantial nature of the mitigating\nevidence\u201d Schick presented. Belmontes v. Woodford, 350\nF. 3d 861, 907 (2003). It reiterated the point several\ntimes. See id., at 874, 901, 908.\n   All told, Schick put nine witnesses on the stand over a\nspan of two days, and elicited a range of testimony on\nBelmontes\u2019 behalf. A number of those witnesses high\nlighted Belmontes\u2019 \u201cterrible\u201d childhood. They testified\nthat his father was an alcoholic and extremely abusive.\nBelmontes\u2019 grandfather described the one-bedroom house\nwhere Belmontes spent much of his childhood as a\n\u201cchicken coop.\u201d Belmontes did not do well in school; he\ndropped out in the ninth grade. His younger sister died\nwhen she was only 10 months old. And his grandmother\ndied tragically when she drowned in her swimming pool.\nSee Record 2314\u20132319, 2324\u20132325, 2344.\n   Family members also testified that, despite these diffi\nculties, Belmontes maintained strong relationships with\nhis grandfather, grandmother, mother, and sister.

S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    Schick also called witnesses who detailed Belmontes\u2019\nreligious conversion while in state custody on the acces\nsory charge. These witnesses told stories about Belmon\ntes\u2019 efforts advising other inmates in his detention center\u2019s\nreligious program, to illustrate that he could live a produc\ntive and meaningful life in prison. They described his\nsuccess working as part of a firefighting crew, detailing his\nrise from lowest man on the team to second in command.\nBelmontes\u2019 assistant chaplain even said that he would use\nBelmontes as a regular part of his prison counseling pro\ngram if the jury handed down a life sentence. Id., at\n2379\u20132384, 2396\u20132398, 2400\u20132407.\n    Belmontes himself bolstered these accounts by testifying\nabout his childhood and religious conversion, both at\nsentencing and during allocution. Belmontes described\nhis childhood as \u201cpretty hard,\u201d but took responsibility for\nhis actions, telling the jury that he did not want to use his\nbackground \u201cas a crutch[,] to say I am in a situation now\n. . . because of that.\u201d Id., at 2343.\n    On remand from this Court, the Court of Appeals\u2014\naddressing Belmontes\u2019 ineffective assistance claim for the\nfirst time\u2014changed its view of this evidence. Instead of\nfinding Schick\u2019s mitigation case \u201csubstantial,\u201d as it previ\nously had, Belmontes, 350 F. 3d, at 907, the Ninth Circuit\nthis time around labeled it \u201ccursory,\u201d Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 841, 861, n. 14, 866. Compare also Belmontes, 350\nF. 3d, at 874, 901, 907 (labeling the mitigation evidence\nSchick presented \u201csubstantial\u201d), with Belmontes, 529\nF. 3d, at 847, n. 3, 874 (labeling the same evidence \u201cinsub\nstantial\u201d). More evidence, the Court of Appeals now con\ncluded, would have made a difference; in particular, more\nevidence to \u201chumanize\u201d Belmontes, as that court put it no\nfewer than 11 times in its opinion. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d,\nat 850, 859, 860, 862, 863, 864, 865, and n. 18, 869, 872,\n874. The Court determined that the failure to put on this\nevidence prejudiced Belmontes.\n8                   WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n   There are two problems with this conclusion: Some of\nthe evidence was merely cumulative of the humanizing\nevidence Schick actually presented; adding it to what was\nalready there would have made little difference. Other\nevidence proposed by the Ninth Circuit would have put\ninto play aspects of Belmontes\u2019 character that would have\ntriggered admission of the powerful Howard evidence in\nrebuttal. This evidence would have made a difference, but\nin the wrong direction for Belmontes. In either event,\nBelmontes cannot establish Strickland prejudice.\n   First, the cumulative evidence. In the Court of Appeals\u2019\nview, Belmontes should have presented more humanizing\nevidence about Belmontes\u2019 \u201cdifficult childhood\u201d and high\nlighted his \u201cpositive attributes.\u201d 529 F. 3d, at 864. As for\nhis difficult childhood, Schick should have called witnesses\nto testify that \u201cwhen Belmontes was five years old, his 10\nmonth-old sister died of a brain tumor,\u201d that he \u201cexhibited\nsymptoms of depression\u201d after her death, that his grand\nmother suffered from \u201calcoholism and prescription drug\naddiction,\u201d and that both his immediate and extended\nfamily lived in a state of \u201cconstant strife.\u201d Ibid. As for his\npositive attributes, Schick should have produced testi\nmony about Belmontes\u2019 \u201cstrong character as a child in the\nface of adversity.\u201d Ibid. Schick should have illustrated\nthat Belmontes was \u201ckind, responsible, and likeable\u201d; that\nhe \u201cgot along well with his siblings\u201d and was \u201crespectful\ntowards his grandparents despite their disapproval of his\nmixed racial background\u201d; and that he \u201cparticipated in\ncommunity activities, kept up in school and got along with\nhis teachers before [an] illness, and made friends easily.\u201d\nIbid.\n   But as recounted above and recognized by the state\ncourts and, originally, this very panel, Schick did put on\nsubstantial mitigation evidence, much of it targeting the\nsame \u201chumanizing\u201d theme the Ninth Circuit highlighted.\nCompare, e.g., ibid., with Record 2317 (death of 10-month\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            9\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nold sister); id., at 2319, 2325 (difficult childhood); id., at\n2314\u20132315 (family member\u2019s addictions); id., at 2314\u2013\n2315, 2324\u20132325 (family strife and abuse); id., at 2317,\n2319, 2347\u20132348, 2397 (strong character as a child); id., at\n2326\u20132327 (close relationship with siblings); id., at 2317\u2013\n2319 (close relationship with grandparents); id., at 2348\u2013\n2351 (participation in community religious events); see\nalso, e.g., Belmontes\u2019 Traverse to Respondent\u2019s Return to\nPet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 5\u201389\u20130736\u2013EJG\u2013\nJFM (ED Cal.), p. 64 (\u201c[C]ounsel\u2019s presentation was ar\nguably adequate only with respect to [evidence] of \u2018human\nizing\u2019 petitioner\u201d). The sentencing jury was thus \u201cwell\nacquainted\u201d with Belmontes\u2019 background and potential\nhumanizing features. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465,\n481 (2007). Additional evidence on these points would\nhave offered an insignificant benefit, if any at all.\n   The Ninth Circuit also determined that both the evi\ndence Schick presented and the additional evidence it\nproposed would have carried greater weight if Schick had\nsubmitted expert testimony. Such testimony could \u201cmake\nconnections between the various themes in the mitigation\ncase and explain to the jury how they could have contrib\nuted to Belmontes\u2019s involvement in criminal activity.\u201d\nBelmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 853. See also ibid. (discussing\nexpert\u2019s federal habeas testimony on importance of expert\ntestimony). But the body of mitigating evidence the Ninth\nCircuit would have required Schick to present was neither\ncomplex nor technical. It required only that the jury make\nlogical connections of the kind a layperson is well\nequipped to make. The jury simply did not need expert\ntestimony to understand the \u201chumanizing\u201d evidence; it\ncould use its common sense or own sense of mercy.\n   What is more, expert testimony discussing Belmontes\u2019\nmental state, seeking to explain his behavior, or putting it\nin some favorable context would have exposed Belmontes\nto the Howard evidence. See Darden v. Wainwright, 477\n10                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nU. S. 168, 186 (1986) (\u201cAny attempt to portray petitioner\nas a nonviolent man would have opened the door for the\nState to rebut with evidence of petitioner\u2019s prior convic\ntions. . . . Similarly, if defense counsel had attempted to\nput on evidence that petitioner was a family man, they\nwould have been faced with his admission at trial that,\nalthough still married, he was spending the weekend\nfurlough with a girlfriend\u201d).\n   If, for example, an expert had testified that Belmontes\nhad a \u201c \u2018high likelihood of a . . . nonviolent adjustment to a\nprison setting,\u2019 \u201d as Belmontes suggested an expert might,\nsee Brief for Appellant in No. 01\u201399018 (CA9), p. 34, the\nquestion would have immediately arisen: \u201cWhat was his\npropensity toward violence to begin with? Does evidence\nof another murder alter your view?\u201d Expert testimony\nexplaining why the jury should feel sympathy, as opposed\nsimply to facts that might elicit that response, would have\nled to a similar rejoinder: \u201cIs such sympathy equally ap\npropriate for someone who committed a second murder?\u201d\nAny of this testimony from an expert\u2019s perspective would\nhave made the Howard evidence fair game.\n   Many of Belmontes\u2019 other arguments fail for the same\nreason. He argues that the jury should have been told\nthat he suffered an \u201cextended bout with rheumatic fever,\u201d\nwhich led to \u201cemotional instability, impulsivity, and im\npairment of the neurophysiological mechanisms for plan\nning and reasoning.\u201d Amended Pet. for Writ of Habeas\nCorpus 120. But the cold, calculated nature of the Howard\nmurder and Belmontes\u2019 subsequent bragging about it\nwould have served as a powerful counterpoint.\n   The type of \u201cmore-evidence-is-better\u201d approach advo\ncated by Belmontes and the Court of Appeals might seem\nappealing\u2014after all, what is there to lose? But here there\nwas a lot to lose. A heavyhanded case to portray Belmon\ntes in a positive light, with or without experts, would have\ninvited the strongest possible evidence in rebuttal\u2014the\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)          11\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nevidence that Belmontes was responsible for not one but\ntwo murders.\n   Belmontes counters that some of the potential mitigat\ning evidence might not have opened the door to the prior\nmurder evidence. The Court of Appeals went so far as to\nstate, without citation, that \u201c[t]here would be no basis for\nsuggesting that [expert testimony] would be any different\nif the expert were informed that Belmontes committed two\nmurders rather than one.\u201d Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 869,\nn. 20. But it is surely pertinent in assessing expert testi\nmony \u201cexplain[ing] . . . involvement in criminal activity,\u201d\nid., at 853, to know what criminal activity was at issue.\nAnd even if the number of murders were as irrelevant as\nthe Ninth Circuit asserted, the fact that these two murders\nwere so different in character made each of them highly\npertinent in evaluating expert testimony of the sort envi\nsioned by the Court of Appeals.\n   The Ninth Circuit noted that the trial court retained\ndiscretion to exclude the Howard evidence even if Schick\nopened the door. Id., at 869\u2013870, n. 20. If Schick had\ndoubts, the Court of Appeals contended, he could have\nsecured an answer in advance through a motion in limine.\nIbid. The trial judge, however, left little doubt where he\nstood. While ruling that the prosecution could not present\nthe evidence in its case in chief, Record 2254, the judge\nmade clear that it would come in for certain rebuttal\npurposes, id., at 2256, 2332\u20132334. When Schick elicited\ntestimony that Belmontes was not violent, for example,\nthe judge ordered it stricken and warned Schick that he\nwould admit the Howard murder evidence\u2014to let the\nprosecution \u201cgo into the whole background\u201d\u2014if Schick\npressed forward. Id., at 2334.\n   In balancing the mitigating factors against the aggrava\ntors, the Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the ag\ngravating evidence the State presented as \u201cscant.\u201d Bel\nmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 870, 873, 874, 875, 878. That\n12                 WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\ncharacterization misses Strickland\u2019s point that the review\ning court must consider all the evidence\u2014the good and the\nbad\u2014when evaluating prejudice. See Strickland, 466\nU. S., at 695\u2013696, 700. Here, the worst kind of bad evi\ndence would have come in with the good. The only reason\nit did not was because Schick was careful in his mitigation\ncase. The State\u2019s aggravation evidence could only be\ncharacterized as \u201cscant\u201d if one ignores the \u201celephant in the\ncourtroom\u201d\u2014Belmontes\u2019 role in the Howard murder\u2014that\nwould have been presented had Schick submitted the\nadditional mitigation evidence. Belmontes v. Ayers, 551\nF. 3d 864, 867 (CA9 2008) (Callahan, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).\n   Even on the record before it\u2014which did not include the\nHoward murder\u2014the state court determined that Belmon\ntes \u201cwas convicted on extremely strong evidence that he\ncommitted an intentional murder of extraordinary brutal\nity.\u201d Belmontes, 45 Cal. 3d, at 819, 755 P. 2d, at 354.\nThat court also noted that \u201c[t]he properly admitted aggra\nvating evidence in this case\u2014in particular, the circum\nstances of the crime\u2014was simply overwhelming.\u201d Id., at\n809, 755 P. 2d, at 348 (citation omitted). The Ninth Cir\ncuit saw the murder differently. It viewed the circum\nstances of the crime as only \u201cconceivably significant\u201d as an\naggravating factor. Belmontes, 529 F. 3d, at 871. In\nparticular, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c[t]he\ncrime here did not involve . . . needless suffering on the\npart of the victim.\u201d Ibid.\n   We agree with the state court\u2019s characterization of the\nmurder, and simply cannot comprehend the assertion by\nthe Court of Appeals that this case did not involve \u201cneed\nless suffering.\u201d The jury saw autopsy photographs show\ning Steacy McConnell\u2019s mangled head, her skull crushed\nby 15 to 20 blows from a steel dumbbell bar the jury found\nto have been wielded by Belmontes.

Belmontes left\nMcConnell to die, but officers found her still fighting for\nher life before ultimately succumbing to the injuries\ncaused by the blows from Belmontes. Record 3. The jury\nalso heard that this savage murder was committed solely\nto prevent interference with a burglary that netted Bel\nmontes $100 he used to buy beer and drugs for the night.\nMcConnell suffered, and it was clearly needless.\n  Some of the error below may be traced to confusion\nabout the appropriate standard and burden of proof.\nWhile the Court of Appeals quoted the pertinent language\nfrom Strickland, that court elsewhere suggested it might\nhave applied something different. In explaining its preju\ndice determination, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201c[t]he\naggravating evidence, even with the addition of evidence\nthat Belmontes murdered Howard, is not strong enough,\nin light of the mitigating evidence that could have been\nadduced, to rule out a sentence of life in prison.\u201d Belmon\ntes, 529 F. 3d, at 875. But Strickland does not require the\nState to \u201crule out\u201d a sentence of life in prison to prevail.\nRather, Strickland places the burden on the defendant,\nnot the State, to show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the\nresult would have been different. 466 U. S., at 694. Un\nder a proper application of the Strickland standard, Bel\nmontes cannot carry this burden.\n  It is hard to imagine expert testimony and additional\nfacts about Belmontes\u2019 difficult childhood outweighing the\nfacts of McConnell\u2019s murder. It becomes even harder to\nenvision such a result when the evidence that Belmontes\nhad committed another murder\u2014\u201cthe most powerful\nimaginable aggravating evidence,\u201d as Judge Levi put it,\nBelmontes, S-89\u20130736, App. to Pet. for Cert. 183a\u2014is\nadded to the mix.

Decided November 16, 2009\n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.\n  When Fernando Belmontes was sentenced to death in\n1982, California Penal Code \u00a7190.3(k)* conveyed the\nunmistakable message that juries could not give any\nmitigating weight to evidence that did not extenuate the\nseverity of the crime. See Ayers v. Belmontes, 549 U. S. 7,\n27 (2006) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The trial judge who\npresided at Belmontes\u2019 sentencing hearing so understood\nthe law, and his instructions to the jury reflected that\nunderstanding. See id., at 33\u201334. It was only later that\nboth the California Supreme Court and this Court\nsquarely held that a jury must be allowed to give weight to\nany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or history that may\nprovide a basis for a sentence other than death, even if\nsuch evidence does not \u201c \u2018tend to reduce the defendant\u2019s\nculpability for his crime.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 28 (quoting Skipper v.\nSouth Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 11 (1986) (Powell, J., concur\nring in judgment)).\n  The testimony adduced at Belmontes\u2019 sentencing hear\ning described his religious conversion and his positive\ncontributions to a youth rehabilitation program. Neither\nhis own testimony, nor that of the two ministers and the\nother witnesses who testified on his behalf, made any\nattempt to extenuate the severity of his crime. Their\ntestimony did, however, afford the jury a principled basis\nfor imposing a sentence other than death. See Ayers, 549\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7190.3(k) (West 1988).\n2                  WONG v. BELMONTES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nU. S., at 29\u201331 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). A review of the\nentire record, especially the colloquy between six jurors\nand the trial judge, makes it clear to me that \u201cthe jury\nbelieved that the law forbade it from giving that evidence\nany weight at all.\u201d Id., at 36\u201339. I therefore remain con\nvinced that in its initial review of this case, the Court of\nAppeals correctly set aside Belmontes\u2019 death sentence.\n   The narrow question that is now before us is whether\nthe additional mitigating evidence that trial counsel failed\nto uncover would have persuaded the jury to return a\ndifferent verdict. The evidence trial counsel might have\npresented hardly matters, however, because in my view\nthe conscientious jurors\u2019 mistaken understanding of the\nlaw would have prevented them from giving that addi\ntional evidence \u201cany weight at all,\u201d id., at 39, let alone\ncontrolling weight. Despite my strong disagreement with\nthe Court\u2019s decision to review this case once again, I nev\nertheless agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that trial\ncounsel\u2019s failure to present additional mitigating evidence\nprobably did not affect the outcome of the trial.\n</pre>",
