MARK LEVENHAGEN, \n\n    SUPERINTENDENT, INDIANA STATE PRISON \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08\u201310495.    Decided October 20, 2009 \n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   An Indiana jury convicted Joseph Corcoran of four\ncounts of murder. Corcoran was sentenced to death. After\nCorcoran\u2019s challenges to his sentence in the Indiana courts\nfailed, he sought federal habeas relief. Corcoran argued in\nhis federal habeas petition that: (1) the Indiana trial court\ncommitted various errors at the sentencing phase; (2) his\nsentence violated the Sixth Amendment; (3) Indiana\u2019s\ncapital sentencing statute was unconstitutional; (4) the\nprosecution committed misconduct at sentencing; and (5)\nhe should not be executed because he suffers from a men\ntal illness. See Corcoran v. Buss, 483 F. Supp. 2d 709,\n719, 726 (ND Ind. 2007). The District Court granted\nhabeas relief on Corcoran\u2019s claim of a Sixth Amendment\nviolation, and ordered the state courts to resentence Cor\ncoran to a penalty other than death. Id., at 725\u2013726. The\nDistrict Court did not address Corcoran\u2019s other arguments\nrelating to his sentence, noting that they were \u201crendered\nmoot\u201d by the order that Corcoran be resentenced because\nof the Sixth Amendment violation. Id., at 734.\n   The Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s Sixth\nAmendment ruling. Corcoran v. Buss, 551 F. 3d 703, 712,\n714 (2008). Then, without mentioning Corcoran\u2019s other\nsentencing claims, the Seventh Circuit remanded \u201cwith\ninstructions to deny the writ,\u201d stating that \u201cIndiana is at\nliberty to reinstate the death penalty.\u201d Id., at 714. Cor\ncoran sought rehearing, arguing that the Court of Appeals\nshould have allowed the District Court to consider his\n2               CORCORAN v. LEVENHAGEN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nadditional attacks on his sentence. But the Court of Ap\npeals denied rehearing, again without referring to Cor\ncoran\u2019s undecided claims.\n  We now grant certiorari and hold that the Seventh\nCircuit erred in disposing of Corcoran\u2019s other claims with\nout explanation of any sort. The Seventh Circuit should\nhave permitted the District Court to consider Corcoran\u2019s\nunresolved challenges to his death sentence on remand, or\nshould have itself explained why such consideration was\nunnecessary.\n  In its brief in opposition, the State argues that Cor\ncoran\u2019s claims were waived, and that they were in any\nevent frivolous, so that a remand would be wasteful. Brief\nin Opposition 9\u201310. Nothing in the Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nopinion, however, suggests that this was the basis for that\ncourt\u2019s order that the writ be denied.\n  The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to\nproceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is vacated,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consis\ntent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n",
