JOHNSON v.

He spent the next 29 years\nchallenging his conviction and sentence in state and fed\neral judicial proceedings and in a petition for executive\nclemency. His challenges were unsuccessful. He now\ncontends that the very proceedings he used to contest his\nsentence should prohibit the State from carrying it out,\nbecause executing him after the \u201clengthy and inhumane\ndelay\u201d occasioned by his appeals would violate the Eighth\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punish\nment. See Ante, at 1 (citing Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S.\n1045, 1045\u20131046 (1995) (STEVENS, J., statement respect\ning denial of certiorari)).\n   It has been 14 years since JUSTICE STEVENS proposed\nthis \u201cnovel\u201d Eighth Amendment argument. Lackey, supra,\nat 1045. I was unaware of any constitutional support for\nthe argument then. See Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990,\n990 (1999) (THOMAS, J., concurring in denial of certiorari).\nAnd I am unaware of any support for it now. There is\nsimply no authority \u201c in the American constitutional tradi\ntion or in this Court\u2019s precedent for the proposition that a\ndefendant can avail himself of the panoply of appellate\n2                 JOHNSON v. BREDESEN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nand collateral procedures and then complain when his\nexecution is delayed.\u201d Thompson v. McNeil, 556 U. S. ___,\n(2009) (slip op., at 1) (THOMAS, J., concurring in denial of\ncertiorari) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\nPetitioner cites no evidence otherwise and, for all his\ncurrent complaints about delay, did not raise a Lackey\nobjection to the speed of his proceedings in the 1999 ha\nbeas petition he filed 18 years into his tenure on death\nrow. See ante, at 4\u20135, n. 3.\n  Undeterred, JUSTICE STEVENS insists that petitioner\u2019s\nEighth Amendment claim warrants relief. It does not, and\nJUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 arguments to the contrary stand in\nstark contrast not only to history and precedent, but also\nto his own recent statement in Muhammad v. Kelly, 558\nU. S. ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1) (statement respecting de\nnial of certiorari) decrying the \u201cperversity of executing\ninmates before their appeals process has been fully con\ncluded.\u201d In JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 view, it seems the State can\nnever get the timing just right. The reason, he has said, is\nthat the death penalty itself is wrong. McNeil, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 4) (statement respecting denial of certio\nrari) (citing Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, ___ (2008)\n(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8, 17)).\nBut that is where he deviates from the Constitution and\nwhere proponents of his view are forced to find their sup\nport in precedent from the \u201cEuropean Court of Human\nRights, the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, the Supreme\nCourt of India, or the Privy Council.\u201d Knight, supra, at\n990 (THOMAS, J. concurring in denial of certiorari).\n  Eager to distinguish this case from Knight and all the\nother cases in which the Court has refused to grant relief\non Lackey grounds, JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that the\npetition here presents important questions regarding the\nproper procedural vehicle for bringing a Lackey claim that\nmerit this Court\u2019s review. First, the procedural posture in\nwhich a Lackey claim arises does not change the fact that\n                  Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nthe claim itself has no constitutional foundation. Accord\ningly, the claim\u2019s procedural posture does not matter for\npurposes of merits relief; a Lackey claim would fail no\nmatter how it arrived. In addition, JUSTICE STEVENS\nconcedes that the unusual contours of petitioner\u2019s Eighth\nAmendment claim are the reason the procedural questions\nin this case are difficult. Given that, our order in this case\nrightly adheres to our precedents denying relief on Lackey\nclaims, however presented. Second, even if the procedural\nclaims in this case had merit, they would not warrant\nreview because JUSTICE STEVENS admits that a \u201csuccessful\nLackey claim would have the effect of rendering invalid a\nparticular death sentence,\u201d ante, at 4, and thus would\n\u201c \u2018directly call into question the \u201cfact\u201d or \u201cvalidity\u201d of the\nsentence itself,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 4 (quoting Nelson v. Campbell,\n541 U. S. 637, 644 (2004)). Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit\nplainly did not err in treating petitioner\u2019s \u00a71983 motion as\n\u201cthe functional equivalent of\u201d a habeas petition. Ante, at\n3. And for the reasons above, the panel\u2019s treatment of the\npetition as a second or successive petition would not, even\nif reversed, entitle petitioner to the merits relief he seeks.\n   At bottom, JUSTICE STEVENS\u2019 arguments boil down to\npolicy disagreements with the Constitution and the Ten\nnessee legislature. Ante, at 3\u20134 (\u201c \u2018[D]elaying an execution\ndoes not further public purposes of retribution and deter\nrence but only diminishes whatever possible benefit soci\nety might receive from petitioner\u2019s death. . . . In other\nwords, the penological justifications for the death penalty\ndiminish as the delay lengthens.\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted)). Such views, no matter how\n\u201csteadfast[ly]\u201d held, ante, at 2, are not grounds for enjoin\ning petitioner\u2019s execution or for granting certiorari on the\nprocedural questions that attend his Lackey claim. As\nlong as our system affords capital defendants the proce\ndural safeguards this Court has long endorsed, defendants\nwho avail themselves of these procedures will face the\n4                  JOHNSON v. BREDESEN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ndelays JUSTICE STEVENS laments. There are, of course,\nalternatives. As Blackstone observed, the principle that\n\u201cpunishment should follow the crime as early as possible\u201d\nfound expression in a \u201cstatute, 25 Geo. II. c. 37,\u201d decreeing\nthat \u201cin case of murder, the judge shall in his sentence\ndirect execution to be performed on the next day but one\nafter sentence passed.\u201d 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*397. I have no doubt that such a system would avoid the\ndiminishing justification problem JUSTICE STEVENS identi\nfies, but I am equally confident that such a system would\nfind little support from this Court. See Knight, 528 U. S.,\nat 990 n. 1 (THOMAS, J. concurring). I thus concur in the\ndenial of certiorari.\n",
