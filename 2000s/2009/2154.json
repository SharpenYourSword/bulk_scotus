LYNN COOPER, WARDEN\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 08\u201310314.   Decided November 30, 2009 \n\n\n   The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma\npauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are\ngranted. The judgment is vacated and the case is re\nmanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit for further consideration in light of Jimenez\nv. Quarterman, 555 U. S. ___ (2009).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.\n   Petitioner was convicted and sentenced in Louisiana\nstate court. His motion for reconsideration of the sentence\nwas denied on April 15, 2003, and he did not appeal. After\ninitiating postconviction relief, he filed in the trial court a\n\u201cmotion to vacate sentence and resentence defendant\u201d on\nthe ground that he had not had a lawyer present at the\nsentencing. That motion was granted, and on June 2,\n2004, petitioner was resentenced, this time with a lawyer,\nto the same term of incarceration.\n   After the conclusion of state postconviction relief, peti\ntioner filed a petition in federal court for habeas corpus\nunder 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. The District Court thought that\nthe 1-year statute of limitations provided by\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A) started to run on May 15, 2003, 30 days\nafter the Louisiana trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion\nfor reconsideration of sentence. Accordingly, it concluded\nthat the statute had expired before petitioner filed his\nfederal habeas petition. The Fifth Circuit denied a certifi\ncate of appealability.\n   Our recent decision in Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S.\n___ (2009), held that the statute of limitations of\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A) does not begin to run until the expiration of\n2                   WEBSTER v. COOPER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe time allowed to seek direct appeal, even if the state\ncourt allows an out-of-time appeal during state collateral\nreview. Id., at ___ \u2013___ (slip op., at 8). The parties do not\nagree, and it is not clear, whether under Louisiana law\npetitioner\u2019s motion to vacate would be regarded as restart\ning the clock for his direct appeal. If so, then the Jimenez\nerror is obvious; if not, there is no error. Today, without\nrequest by (or even warning to) the parties, the Court\ngrants certiorari, vacates the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment\nwithout determination of the merits, and remands for\nfurther consideration in light of Jimenez.\n   I certainly agree that we have the power to GVR \u201cwhere\nan intervening factor has arisen that has a legal bearing\nupon the decision.\u201d Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163,\n191\u2013192 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). The purpose of\nsuch an \u201cintervening-factor\u201d GVR is to give the court to\nwhich we remand the first opportunity to consider the\nfactor\u2014in this case a new decision of ours. Though we\nhave sometimes GVR\u2019d in light of decisions that preceded\nthe decision vacated, see, e.g., Grier v. United States, 419\nU. S. 989 (1974), I have acquiesced in this expansion of\n\u201cintervening-factor\u201d GVRs only when (as in Grier) our\ndecision came so soon before the judgment in question\n\u201cthat the lower court might have been unaware of it.\u201d\nLawrence, supra, at 181 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). This is\nnot such a case: We decided Jimenez on January 13, 2009,\nmore than two months before the Fifth Circuit denied the\ncertificate. There is thus no basis for regarding that deci\nsion as an \u201cintervening\u201d factor\u2014that is, one that the Court\nof Appeals did not have before it.\n   This is not, of course, the first time the Court has GVR\u2019d\non the basis of a case decided long before the Court of\nAppeals ruled, see, e.g., Robinson v. Story, 469 U. S. 1081\n(1984) (three months), nor the first time I have protested,\nsee Lawrence, supra, at 184 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (more\nthan a year). This practice has created a new mode of\n                 Cite as: 558 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndisposition, a sort of ersatz summary reversal. We do not\nsay that the judgment below was wrong, but since we\nsuspect that it may be wrong and do not want to waste our\ntime figuring it out, we instruct the Court of Appeals to do\nthe job again, with a particular issue prominently in mind.\n   It surely suggests something is amiss that this case\nwould be over, and petitioner would be worse off, if he had\nasked us to reverse the judgment below on the basis of\nJimenez. Since he did not argue that ground to the Court\nof Appeals, and since that court did not address it, we\nwould almost certainly deny certiorari. See Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U. S. 103, 108\u2013109 (2001)\n(per curiam) (dismissing a writ as improvidently granted\nbecause the question at issue was not raised or considered\nbelow). Have we established a new system in which a\nparty\u2019s repetition before this Court of his failure below\n(here, the failure to invoke Jimenez) cures\u2014and causes us\nto reward\u2014his earlier failure? Or perhaps we are develop\ning a new system in which all arguably valid points not\nraised and not discussed below\u2014whether or not belatedly\nraised here\u2014will be sent back for a redo by the Court of\nAppeals. And if we can apply this failure-friendly practice\nto a neglected precedent two months old, there is no rea\nson in principle not to apply it to a neglected precedent\ntwo years old.\n   In my view we have no power to set aside the duly re\ncorded judgments of lower courts unless we find them to\nbe in error, or unless they are cast in doubt by a factor\narising after they were rendered. The GVR for considera\ntion of a day\u2019s old Supreme Court case is already a techni\ncal violation of sound practice and should not be extended\nfurther. Since we review judgments rather than opinions,\na lower court\u2019s failure to discuss a pre-existing factor it\nshould have discussed is no basis for reversal. Once we\ndisregard the logic (and the attendant limits) of \u201cinterven\ning-factor\u201d GVRs, they metastasize into today\u2019s monster.\n4                 WEBSTER v. COOPER\n\n                   SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nWe should at least give it a new and honest name\u2014not\nGVR, but perhaps SRMEOPR: Summary Remand for a\nMore Extensive Opinion than Petitioner Requested.
