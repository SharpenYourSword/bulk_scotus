By denying Muhammad\u2019s stay\napplication, we have allowed Virginia to truncate our\ndeliberative process on a matter\u2014involving a death row\ninmate\u2014that demands the most careful attention. This\nresult is particularly unfortunate in light of the limited\ntime Muhammad was given to make his case in the Dis\ntrict Court.\n   I continue to believe that the Court would be wise to\nadopt a practice of staying all executions scheduled in\nadvance of the completion of our review of a capital defen\n2                  MUHAMMAD v.
