JAMES FORD SEALE\nON CERTIFIED QUESTION BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n             No. 09\u2013166.   Decided November 2, 2009\n\n  The question certified by the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit is dismissed.\n  Statement of JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE\nSCALIA joins, respecting the dismissal of the certified\nquestion.\n  This certificate presents us with a pure question of law\nthat may well determine the outcome of a number of cases\nof ugly racial violence remaining from the 1960s. The\nquestion is what statute of limitations applies to a prose\ncution under 18 U. S. C. \u00a71201 commenced in 2007 for a\nkidnaping offense that occurred in 1964.\n  James Ford Seale was found guilty of violating \u00a71201, a\nprovision that does not include its own limitations period.\nTitle 18 U. S. C. \u00a73281 provides that \u201cany offense punish\nable by death\u201d may be prosecuted \u201cat any time without\nlimitation,\u201d whereas \u00a73282(a) imposes a 5-year period of\nlimitations for all other offenses \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise\nexpressly provided by law.\u201d In 1964 a violation of \u00a71201\nwas a capital offense when the victim was harmed, and\nsince 1994 a violation of \u00a71201 has been a capital offense\nwhen the kidnaping results in the loss of life. But for\nmore than two decades in between, Seale\u2019s crime was not\npunishable by death.\n  Several developments accounted for this. In 1968 this\nCourt held that the death penalty provision in the old\n\u00a71201 was unconstitutional because it applied \u201conly to\nthose defendants who assert the right to contest their guilt\nbefore a jury,\u201d United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570,\n581, and in 1972 we cast significant doubt on the constitu\n2                 UNITED STATES v. SEALE\n\n                    Statement of STEVENS, J.\n\ntionality of death penalty laws nationwide, Furman v.\nGeorgia, 408 U. S. 238 (per curiam). Following Furman,\nCongress repealed the death penalty clause of \u00a71201, see\nAct for the Protection of Foreign Officials and Official\nGuests of the United States, Pub. L. 92\u2013539, \u00a7201, 86 Stat.\n1072, which had the effect of changing the applicable\nstatute of limitations from \u00a73281 to \u00a73282.\n   In this case, the District Court held that the 1972 repeal\ndid not retroactively change the character of a violation of\n\u00a71201 as a capital offense within the meaning of \u00a73281\u2014\nand therefore that the prosecution of Seale could go for\nward\u2014but a panel of the Court of Appeals reversed. 542\nF. 3d 1033 (CA5 2008). In response to the Government\u2019s\npetition for rehearing en banc, the full court vacated the\npanel decision and, by an equally divided 9-to-9 vote,\naffirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling on the limitations\ndefense. 570 F. 3d 650 (CA5 2009) (per curiam); see also\nid., at 651 (DeMoss, J., dissenting) (noting the affir\nmance\u2019s \u201cnominal\u201d nature in light of the deadlock). Fol\nlowing the procedure authorized by Congress in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71254(2) and by this Court\u2019s Rule 19, a majority of\nthe members of the en banc court voted to certify this\nquestion of law to us for decision.\n   The question is narrow, debatable, and important. I\nrecognize that the question reaches us in an interlocutory\nposture, as Seale appealed his conviction on numerous\ngrounds, and that \u201c[i]t is primarily the task of a Court of\nAppeals to reconcile its internal difficulties,\u201d Wisniewski v.\nUnited States, 353 U. S. 901, 902 (1957) (per curiam). Yet\nI see no benefit and significant cost to postponing the\nquestion\u2019s resolution. A prompt answer from this Court\nwill expedite the termination of this litigation and deter\nmine whether other similar cases may be prosecuted.

The Court has accepted only a handful of\ncertified cases since the 1940s and none since 1981; it is a\nnewsworthy event these days when a lower court even\ntries for certification. Section 1254(2) and this Court\u2019s\nRule 19 remain part of our law because the certification\nprocess serves a valuable, if limited, function.
