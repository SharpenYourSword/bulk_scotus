The question ruled by the court below and solely argued before us became in effect a moot question, not calling for determination here. <i>Mills</i> v. <i>Green,</i> 159 U.S. 651.</p>\n<p>But the disposition of this writ of error must be rested on another ground.</p>\n<p>The proceeding is in <i>habeas corpus,</i> and is a civil and not a criminal proceeding. <i>Cross</i> v. <i>Burke,</i> 146 U.S. 82, 88. Sec. 10 of the Philippine Act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. c. 1369, pp. 691, 695, provides:</p>\n<p>\"That the Supreme Court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm the final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in all actions, cases, causes, and proceedings now pending therein or hereafter determined thereby in which the Constitution or any statute, treaty, title, right, or privilege of the United States is involved, or in causes in which the value in controversy exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars, or in which the title or possession of real estate exceeding in value the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars, to be ascertained by the oath of either party or of other competent witnesses, is involved or brought in question; and such final judgments or decrees may and can be reviewed, revised, reversed, modified, or affirmed by said Supreme Court of the United States <span class=\"star-pagination\">*182</span> on appeal or writ of error by the party aggrieved, in the same manner, under the same regulations, and by the same procedure, as far as applicable, as the final judgments and decrees of the Circuit Courts of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>Final orders of the Circuit Courts or District Courts of the United States in <i>habeas corpus</i> can only be reviewed by appeal and not by writ of error. <i>In re Morrisey,</i> 137 U.S. 157, 158; <i>Rice</i> v. <i>Ames,</i> 180 U.S. 371, 373. In the latter case the court said:</p>\n<p>\"Motion is made to dismiss the appeal upon the ground that there is no provision of law allowing an appeal in this class of cases. Prior to the Court of Appeals Act of 1891, provision was made for an appeal to the Circuit Court in <i>habeas corpus</i> cases 'from the final decision of any court, justice or judge inferior to the Circuit Court,' Rev. Stat. sec. 763; and from the final decision of such Circuit Court an appeal might be taken to this court. Rev. Stat. sec. 764, as amended March 3, 1885, c. 353, 23 Stat. 437.</p>\n<p>\"The law remained in this condition until the Court of Appeals Act of March, 1891, was passed, the fifth section of which permits an appeal directly from the District Court to this court `in any case in which the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority, is drawn in question.' In this connection the appellee insists that an appeal will not lie, but that a writ of error is the proper remedy. In support of this we are cited to the case of <i>Bucklin</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 159 U.S. 680, in which the appellant was convicted of the crime of perjury, and sought a review of the judgment against him by an appeal, which we held must be dismissed, upon the ground that criminal cases were reviewable here only by writ of error. Obviously that case has no application to this, since under the prior sections of the Revised Statutes, above cited, which are taken from the act of 1842, an <i>appeal</i> was allowed in <i>habeas corpus</i> cases. The observation made in the <i>Bucklin</i> case that `there was no purpose by that act to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*183</span> abolish the general distinction, at common law, between an appeal and a writ of error,' may be supplemented by saying that it was no purpose of the act of 1891 to change the forms of remedies theretofore pursued. <i>In re Lennon,</i> 150 U.S. 393; <i>Ekiu</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 142 U.S. 651; <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Cunningham,</i> 164 U.S. 612.\"</p>\n<p><i>Writ of error dismissed.</i></p>\n</div>", "html_with_citations": "<div>\n<center><b><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">174</span></span> (1906)</b></center>\n<center><h1>FISHER, ON BEHALF OF BARCELON<br>\nv.<br>\nBAKER.</h1></center>\n<center>No. 214.</center>\n<center><p><b>Supreme Court of United States.</b></p></center>\n<center>Argued October 9, 10.</center>\n<center>Decided December 3, 1906.</center>\nERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n<p><i>Mr. Frederic R.
