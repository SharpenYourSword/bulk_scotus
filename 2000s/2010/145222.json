Argued November 30, 2009\u2014Decided April 27, 2010\nOn November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud ac\n tion under \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging\n that petitioner Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart\n attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx. A securities fraud com\n plaint is timely if filed no more than \u201c2 years after the discovery of\n the facts constituting the violation\u201d or 5 years after the violation. 28\n U. S. C. \u00a71658(b). The District Court dismissed the complaint as un\n timely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibil\n ity of Merck\u2019s misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than\n 2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to under\n take a reasonably diligent investigation at that time. Among the\n relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 \u201cVIGOR\u201d study com\n paring Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse car\n diovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to\n the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm\n caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning let\n ter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck\u2019s\n Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was \u201cfalse,\n lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading\u201d; and (3) pleadings\n filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 al\n leging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and inten\n tionally downplayed its risks. The Third Circuit reversed, holding\n that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted\n with scienter, an element of a \u00a710(b) violation, and consequently did\n not commence the running of the limitations period.\nHeld:\n    1. The limitations period in \u00a71658(b)(1) begins to run once the\n plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n2                      MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    have \u201cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever\n    comes first. In the statute of limitations context, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is often\n    used as a term of art in connection with the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d a doc\n    trine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has\n    \u201cdiscovered\u201d it. The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by\n    state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures\n    have sometimes codified this rule. When \u201cdiscovery\u201d is written di\n    rectly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to re\n    fer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery\n    of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. Congress in\n    tended courts to interpret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1) simi\n    larly. That statute was enacted after this Court determined a gov\n    erning limitations period for private \u00a710(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva,\n    Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding\n    that such actions \u201cmust be commenced within one year after the dis\n    covery of the facts constituting the violation . . . ,\u201d id., at 364 (empha\n    sis added). Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have\n    held that \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers\n    the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n    have discovered them. In 2002, Congress repeated Lampf\u2019s critical\n    language in enacting the present limitations statute. Normally,\n    when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial prece\n    dent. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116\u2013\n    117, and n. 13. Given the history and precedent surrounding the use\n    of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the limitations context generally as well as in this\n    provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly\n    strong here. Merck\u2019s claims are evaluated accordingly. Pp. 8\u201312.\n       2. In determining the time at which \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs, terms such\n    as \u201cinquiry notice\u201d and \u201cstorm warnings\u201d may be useful insofar as\n    they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasona\n    bly diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations pe\n    riod does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a\n    reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered \u201cthe facts consti\n    tuting the violation,\u201d including scienter\u2014irrespective of whether the\n    actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n    Pp. 12\u201317.\n          (a) Contrary to Merck\u2019s argument, facts showing scienter are\n    among those that \u201cconstitut[e] the violation.\u201d Scienter is assuredly a\n    \u201cfact.\u201d In a \u00a710(b) action, it refers to \u201ca mental state embracing in\n    tent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n    425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12, and \u201cconstitut[es]\u201d an important and neces\n    sary element of a \u00a710(b) \u201cviolation.\u201d See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues\n    & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. Because the scienter element of\n    \u00a710(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                         3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2), unless a \u00a710(b) complaint sets forth facts show\ning that it is \u201cat least as likely as not\u201d that the defendant acted with the\nrelevant intent, the claim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328 (emphasis de\nleted). It would frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule codified in\n\u00a71658(b)(1) if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a\nplaintiff had \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d any facts suggesting scienter. Pp. 12\u201314.\n      (b) The Court also rejects Merck\u2019s argument that, even if \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a mate\nrially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordi\nnarily sufficient to show scienter. Where \u00a710(b) is at issue, the\nrelation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.\nFor instance, an incorrect prediction about a firm\u2019s future earnings,\nby itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliber\nately lied or made an innocent error. Hence, \u201cdiscovery\u201d of additional\nscienter-related facts may be required. The statute\u2019s inclusion of an\nunqualified bar on actions instituted \u201c5 years after such violation,\u201d\n\u00a71658(b)(2), should diminish Merck\u2019s fear that this requirement will\ngive life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts\ntaken long ago. P. 14.\n      (c) And the Court cannot accept Merck\u2019s argument that the limi\ntations period begins at \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d meaning the point where\nthe facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate fur\nther, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the\nplaintiff would already have \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d facts showing scienter or\nother \u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d The statute says that the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim accrues only after the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of those latter\nfacts. It contains no indication that the limitations period can some\ntimes begin before \u201cdiscovery\u201d can take place. Merck also argues that\ndetermining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\nhave \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the necessary facts is too complicated for judges\nto undertake. But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have\nlong had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this\nkind of inquiry in securities fraud cases. Pp. 14\u201317.\n   3. Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered, \u201cthe facts constituting the violation.\u201d The FDA\u2019s Septem\nber 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here\nrelevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hy\npothesis with fraudulent intent. The FDA itself described the hy\npothesis as a \u201cpossible explanation\u201d for the VIGOR results, faulting\nMerck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable al\nternative, that Vioxx might be harmful. The products-liability com\nplaints\u2019 general statements about Merck\u2019s state of mind show little\n4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    more. Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-\n    November 2001 circumstances reveal \u201cfacts\u201d indicating the relevant\n    scienter.

The complaint was\ntimely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs\n\u201cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute\nfor the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1)\nwhen the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a rea\nsonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, \u201cthe facts\nconstituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever comes first. We\nalso hold that the \u201cfacts constituting the violation\u201d include\nthe fact of scienter, \u201ca mental state embracing intent to\ndeceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976). Applying this\nstandard, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination\nthat the complaint filed here was timely.\n                             I\n  The action before us involves a claim by a group of inves\ntors (the plaintiffs, respondents here) that Merck & Co.\nand others (the petitioners here, hereinafter Merck) know\ningly misrepresented the risks of heart attacks accompany\n2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning the use of Merck\u2019s pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to\neconomic losses when the risks later became apparent).\nThe plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under\n\u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat.\n891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b); SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17\nCFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b) (2009); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341\u2013342 (2005).\n   The applicable statute of limitations provides that a\n\u201cprivate right of action\u201d that, like the present action,\n\u201cinvolves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or con\ntrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement\nconcerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not\nlater than the earlier of\u2014\n   \u201c(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting\nthe violation; or\n   \u201c(2) 5 years after such violation.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b).\n   The complaint in this case was filed on November 6,\n2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years\nof the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for\ntimeliness purposes is November 6, 2001\u2014two years\nbefore this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before\nthis date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the\n\u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d If so, by the time the\nplaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period\nin \u00a71658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had\nnot, and could not have, discovered by the critical date\nthose \u201cfacts,\u201d particularly not the facts related to scienter,\nand that their complaint was therefore timely.\n                            A\n  We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts,\nas we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and\nthe opinions below.\n  1. 1990\u2019s. In the mid-1990\u2019s Merck developed Vioxx. In\n1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it\nfor prescription use. Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe body\u2019s production of an enzyme called COX\u20132 (cyclooxy-\ngenase-2). COX\u20132 is associated with pain and inflamma-\ntion. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its\nclass like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not\ninhibit production of a second enzyme called COX\u20131\n(cyclooxygenase-1). COX\u20131 plays a part in the functioning\nof the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation\n(associated with blood clots). App. 50\u201351.\n   2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study,\ncalled the \u201cVIGOR\u201d study. Id., at 291\u2013294. The study\ncompared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The\nstudy showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer\ngastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But\nthe study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every\n1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks,\ncompared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took\nnaproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Com-\nparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib\nand Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343\nNew England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526\u20131527 (2000).\n   Merck\u2019s press release acknowledged VIGOR\u2019s adverse\ncardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were\n\u201cconsistent with naproxen\u2019s ability to block platelet aggre-\ngation.\u201d App. 291. Merck noted that, since \u201cVioxx, like all\nCOX\u20132 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggre-\ngation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.\u201d\nIbid. And Merck added that \u201csafety data from all other\ncompleted and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indica-\ntion of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic\nevents between Vioxx\u201d and either a placebo or comparable\ndrugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).\n   This theory\u2014that VIGOR\u2019s troubling cardiovascular\nfindings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred\nby naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx\u2014\nlater became known as the \u201cnaproxen hypothesis.\u201d In\nadvancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the\n4                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnaproxen benefit \u201chad not been observed previously.\u201d Id.,\nat 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all\nof the above\u2014the positive gastrointestinal results, the\ntroubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis,\nand the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.\nSee id., at 355\u2013391, 508\u2013557.\n   3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about\nthe naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the\nFDA\u2019s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider\nMerck\u2019s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect\nVIGOR\u2019s positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR\ncardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392\u2013\n395, 558\u2013577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a\nproducts-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that\n\u201cMerck\u2019s own research\u201d had demonstrated that \u201cusers of\nVioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as\ncompared to other less expensive, medications.\u201d Id., at\n869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation wrote that the available data raised a \u201ccau\ntionary flag\u201d and strongly urged that \u201ca trial specifically\nassessing cardiovascular risk\u201d be done. Id., at 331\u2013332;\nMukherjee, Nissen, & Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular\nEvents Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286\nJAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg\nNews quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck\nhad \u201cadditional data\u201d that were \u201cvery, very reassuring,\u201d\nand Merck issued a press release stating that it stood\n\u201cbehind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of\nVioxx.\u201d App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n   4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a\nwarning letter released to the public on September 21,\n2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,\nMerck\u2019s Vioxx marketing was \u201cfalse, lacking in fair bal\nance, or otherwise misleading.\u201d Id., at 339. At the same\ntime, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas a \u201cpossible explanation\u201d of the VIGOR results. Id., at\n340. But it found that Merck\u2019s \u201cpromotional campaign\nselectively present[ed]\u201d that hypothesis without adequately\nacknowledging \u201canother reasonable explanation,\u201d namely,\n\u201cthat Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardio\nvascular] properties.\u201d Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to\nsend healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.\n    After the FDA letter was released, more products\nliability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885\u2013956. Merck\u2019s\nshare price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832.\nBy October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October\n9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexam\nined its own data and \u201cfound no evidence that Vioxx in\ncreased the risk of heart attacks.\u201d App. 504. It quoted the\npresident of Merck Research Laboratories as positing\n\u201c \u2018two possible interpretations\u2019 \u201d: \u201c \u2018Naproxen lowers the\nheart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Stock ana\nlysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that\nthe FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis\nremained an unproven but possible explanation. See id.,\nat 614, 626, 628.\n                             B\n   We next set forth three important events that occurred\nafter the critical date.\n   1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the\nresults of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Bos\nton\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. After examining\nthe medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare pa\ntients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to\n90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart\nattack than those given either a different painkiller or no\npainkiller at all. Id., at 164\u2013165. (That is to say, if pa\ntients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at\nall suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of\npatients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMerck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study\u2019s limita\ntions. Id., at 165\u2013167.\n   2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the\nmarket. It said that a new study had found \u201can increased\nrisk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18\nmonths of continuous therapy.\u201d Id., at 182 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly\ndescribed the results as \u201ctotally unexpected.\u201d Id., at 186.\nMerck\u2019s shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.\n   3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published\nan article stating that \u201cinternal Merck e-mails and mar\nketing materials as well as interviews with outside scien\ntists show that the company fought forcefully for years to\nkeep safety concerns from destroying the drug\u2019s commer\ncial prospects.\u201d Id., at 189\u2013190. The article said that an\nearly e-mail from Merck\u2019s head of research had said that\nthe VIGOR \u201cresults showed that the cardiovascular events\n\u2018are clearly there,\u2019 \u201d that it was \u201c \u2018a shame but . . . a low\nincidence,\u2019 \u201d and that it \u201c \u2018is mechanism based as we wor\nried it was.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had\ngiven its salespeople instructions to \u201c \u2018DODGE\u2019 \u201d questions\nabout Vioxx\u2019s cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.\n                             C\n   The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6,\n2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged\nthat Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the\nnaproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.\nIt said, for example, that Merck \u201cknew, at least as early as\n1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,\u201d and that a\n\u201c1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . .\nserious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more\nfrequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a\ndifferent arthritis drug or placebo.\u201d Id., at 56, 58\u201359\n(emphasis and capitalization deleted).\n   Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nknown the \u201cfacts constituting the violation\u201d at least two\nyears earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it\nwas filed too late. The District Court granted the motion.\nThe court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the\n(September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck\u2019s (Octo\nber 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a\n\u201cpossibility that Merck had knowingly misrepresented\nmaterial facts\u201d no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing\nthe plaintiffs on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d to look further. In re\nMerck & Co. Securities, Derivative & \u201cERISA\u201d Litigation,\n483 F. Supp. 2d 407, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added).\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to \u201cshow that they\nexercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were\nunable to discover their injuries,\u201d the court took October 9,\n2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run\nand therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A\nmajority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while\nconstituting \u201cstorm warnings,\u201d did not suggest much by\nway of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs\non \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d requiring them to investigate further.\nIn re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & \u201cERISA\u201d Litiga\ntion, 543 F. 3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge consid\nered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the\n2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).\n   Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to dis\nagreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theo\nharous v. Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001) (limita\ntions period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs\non \u201cinquiry notice\u201d of the need for investigation), with\nShah v. Meeker, 435 F. 3d 244, 249 (CA2 2006) (same; but\nif plaintiff does investigate, period runs \u201cfrom the date\nsuch inquiry should have revealed the fraud\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)), and New England Health Care\nEmployees Pension Fund v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F. 3d\n495, 501 (CA6 2003) (limitations period always begins to\n8                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrun only when a reasonably diligent plaintiff, after being\nput on \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d should have discovered facts con\nstituting violation (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nWe granted Merck\u2019s petition.\n                             II\n  Before turning to Merck\u2019s arguments, we consider a\nmore basic matter. The parties and the Solicitor General\nagree that \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s word \u201cdiscovery\u201d refers not only to\na plaintiff\u2019s actual discovery of certain facts, but also to\nthe facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered. We agree. But because the statute\u2019s language\ndoes not make this interpretation obvious, and because we\ncannot answer the question presented without considering\nwhether the parties are right about this matter, we set\nforth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.\n\n   We recognize that one might read the statutory words\n\u201cafter the discovery of the facts constituting the violation\u201d\nas referring to the time a plaintiff actually discovered the\nrelevant facts. But in the statute of limitations context,\nthe word \u201cdiscovery\u201d is often used as a term of art in con\nnection with the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d a doctrine that delays\naccrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has \u201cdiscov\nered\u201d it. The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to\nthe general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues\nonce a plaintiff has a \u201ccomplete and present cause of ac\ntion,\u201d Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust\nFund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997)\n(citing Clark v. Iowa City, 20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875); inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). This Court long ago recog\nnized that something different was needed in the case of\nfraud, where a defendant\u2019s deceptive conduct may prevent\na plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been\ndefrauded. Otherwise, \u201cthe law which was designed to\nprevent fraud\u201d could become \u201cthe means by which it is\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmade successful and secure.\u201d Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall.\n342, 349 (1875). Accordingly, \u201cwhere a plaintiff has been\ninjured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without\nany fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar\nof the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is\ndiscovered.\u201d Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397\n(1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded). And for more than a century, courts have under\nstood that \u201c[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been\ndiscovered.\u201d 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions \u00a7276b(11),\np. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401\u20131403, and nn. 74\u2013\n84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg,\nsupra, at 397; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern\nR. Co., 120 U. S. 130, 138 (1887) (The rule \u201cregard[s] the\ncause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud\nwas or should have been discovered\u201d).\n  More recently, both state and federal courts have ap\nplied forms of the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d to claims other than\nfraud. See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a7\u00a711.1.2.1,\n11.1.2.3, pp. 136\u2013142, and nn. 6\u201313, 18\u201323 (1991 and 1993\nSupp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111 (1979). Legisla\ntures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts.\n2 Corman \u00a711.2, at 170\u2013171, and nn. 1\u20139 (collecting stat\nutes); see, e.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(g) (actions to quiet title\nagainst the United States). In doing so, legislators have\nwritten the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d directly into the statute. And\nwhen they have done so, state and federal courts have\ntypically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual\ndiscovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a\nreasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g., Pea\ncock v. Barnes, 142 N. C. 215, 217\u2013220, 55 S. E. 99, 100\n(1906); Davis v. Hibernia Sav. & Loan Soc., 21 Cal. App.\n444, 448, 132 P. 462, 464 (1913); Roether v. National\nUnion Fire Ins. Co., 51 N. D. 634, 640\u2013642, 200 N. W. 818,\n10               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n821 (1924); Goldenberg v. Bache & Co., 270 F. 2d 675, 681\n(CA5 1959); Mobley v. Hall, 202 Mont. 227, 232, 657 P. 2d\n604, 606 (1983); Tregenza v. Great American Communica\ntions Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721\u2013722 (CA7 1993); J. Geils Band\nEmployee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76\nF. 3d 1245, 1254 (CA1 1996).\n   Thus, treatise writers now describe \u201cthe discovery rule\u201d\nas allowing a claim \u201cto accrue when the litigant first\nknows or with due diligence should know facts that will\nform the basis for an action.\u201d 2 Corman \u00a711.1.1, at 134\n(emphasis added); see also ibid., n. 1 (collecting cases); 37\nAm. Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit \u00a7347, p. 354 (2001 and\nSupp. 2009) (noting that the various formulations of \u201cdis\ncovery\u201d all provide that \u201cin addition to actual knowledge of\nthe fraud, once a reasonably diligent party is in a position\nthat they should have sufficient knowledge or information\nto have actually discovered the fraud, they are charged\nwith discovery\u201d); id., at 354\u2013355, and nn. 2\u201311 (collecting\ncases).\n   Like the parties, we believe that Congress intended\ncourts to interpret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1)\nsimilarly. Before Congress enacted that statute, this\nCourt, having found in the federal securities laws the\nexistence of an implied private \u00a710(b) action, determined\nits governing limitations period by looking to other limita\ntions periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva,\nLipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350\n(1991). Noting the existence of various formulations\n\u201cdiffer[ing] slightly in terminology,\u201d the Court chose the\nlanguage in 15 U. S. C. \u00a778i(e), the statutory provision\nthat governs securities price manipulation claims. 501\nU. S., at 364, n. 9. And in doing so, the Court said that\nprivate \u00a710(b) actions \u201cmust be commenced within one\nyear after the discovery of the facts constituting the viola\ntion and within three years after such violation.\u201d Id., at\n364 (emphasis added). (The Court listed among the vari\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nous formulations the one in 15 U. S. C. \u00a777m, on which the\nconcurrence relies. See post, at 2\u20134 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360,\nand n. 7 (quoting \u00a777m).)\n  Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the\nmatter held that \u201cdiscovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation\u201d occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discov\ners the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have discovered them. See, e.g.,\nLaw v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F. 3d 781, 785\u2013786 (CA7\n1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F. 3d 346, 350,\n353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation,\n306 F. 3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).\nSome of those courts noted that other limitations provi\nsions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that\nthe period begins to run \u201c \u2018after the discovery of the untrue\nstatement . . . or after such discovery should have been\nmade by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,\u2019 \u201d whereas\nthe formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting\n\u00a777m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at\n364, n. 9. But, courts reasoned, because the term \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long\nbeen understood to include discoveries a reasonably dili\ngent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit\nprovision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at\n721; accord, New England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 499\u2013\n500.\n  In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations\nstatute, it repeated Lampf\u2019s critical language. The statute\nsays that an action based on fraud \u201cmay be brought not\nlater than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of\nthe facts constituting the violation\u201d (or \u201c5 years after such\nviolation\u201d). \u00a7804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801,\ncodified at 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b) (emphasis added). (This\nstatutory provision does not make the linguistic distinc\n12               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion that the concurrence finds in a different statute,\n\u00a777m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an\naction be brought \u201cthree years after the earliest date on\nwhich the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or\nviolation\u201d (emphasis added)).)      Not surprisingly, the\nCourts of Appeals unanimously have continued to inter\npret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in this statute as including not\nonly facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts\nany reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g.,\nStaehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F. 3d\n406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne\nParish Consolidated Govt., 503 F. 3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).\n   We normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat\nutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g.,\nEdelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116\u2013117,\nand n. 13 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus\ntries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993). Given the history\nand precedent surrounding the use of the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nin the limitations context generally as well as in this\nprovision in particular, the reasons for making this as\nsumption are particularly strong here. We consequently\nhold that \u201cdiscovery\u201d as used in this statute encompasses\nnot only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also\nthose facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown. And we evaluate Merck\u2019s claims accordingly.\n                             III\n   We turn now to Merck\u2019s arguments in favor of holding\nthat petitioners\u2019 claims accrued before November 6, 2001.\nFirst, Merck argues that the statute does not require\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of scienter-related \u201cfacts.\u201d See Brief for Peti\ntioners 19\u201328. We cannot agree, however, that facts about\nscienter are unnecessary.\n   The statute says that the limitations period does not\nbegin to run until \u201cdiscovery of the facts constituting the\n                   Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)             13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nviolation.\u201d    28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nScienter is assuredly a \u201cfact.\u201d In a \u00a710(b) action, scienter\nrefers to \u201ca mental state embracing intent to deceive,\nmanipulate, or defraud.\u201d Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S., at 194,\nn. 12. And the \u201c \u2018state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as\nthe state of his digestion.\u2019 \u201d Postal Service Bd. of Gover\nnors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983) (quoting Edging\nton v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).\n   And this \u201cfact\u201d of scienter \u201cconstitut[es]\u201d an important\nand necessary element of a \u00a710(b) \u201cviolation.\u201d A plaintiff\ncannot recover without proving that a defendant made a\nmaterial misstatement with an intent to deceive\u2014not\nmerely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v.\nMakor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319 (2007);\nErnst & Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted\nspecial heightened pleading requirements for the scienter\nelement of \u00a710(b) fraud cases. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2)\n(requiring plaintiffs to \u201cstate with particularity facts\ngiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\nwith the required state of mind\u201d (emphasis added)). As a\nresult, unless a \u00a710(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the\ncomplaint showing that it is \u201cat least as likely as\u201d not that the\ndefendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the\nclaim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328 (emphasis deleted). It\nwould therefore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery\nrule in this provision\u2014which, after all, specifically applies\nonly in cases \u201cinvolv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipu\nlation, or contrivance,\u201d \u00a71658(b)\u2014if the limitations period\nbegan to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discov\nered any facts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant\nconcealed for two years that he made a misstatement with\nan intent to deceive, the limitations period would expire\nbefore the plaintiff had actually \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the fraud.\n   We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are\namong those that \u201cconstitut[e] the violation.\u201d In so hold\ning, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support\n14               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na private \u00a710(b) action. Cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 12, n. 1 (suggesting that facts concerning a\nplaintiff\u2019s reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among\nthose that constitute \u201cthe violation\u201d and therefore need not\nbe \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d for a claim to accrue).\n   Second, Merck argues that, even if \u201cdiscovery\u201d requires\nfacts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materi\nally false or misleading statement (or material omission)\nare ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well. See\nBrief for Petitioners 22, 28\u201329. But we do not see how\nthat is so. We recognize that certain statements are such\nthat, to show them false is normally to show scienter as\nwell. It is unlikely, for example, that someone would\nfalsely say \u201cI am not married\u201d without being aware of the\nfact that his statement is false. Where \u00a710(b) is at issue,\nhowever, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is\nmore context specific. An incorrect prediction about a\nfirm\u2019s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell\nus whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an\ninnocent (and therefore nonactionable) error. Hence, the\nstatute may require \u201cdiscovery\u201d of scienter-related facts\nbeyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be\nmaterially false or misleading. Merck fears that this\nrequirement will give life to stale claims or subject defen\ndants to liability for acts taken long ago. But Congress\u2019\ninclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions\ninstituted \u201c5 years after such violation,\u201d \u00a71658(b)(2), giv\ning defendants total repose after five years, should dimin\nish that fear. Cf. Lampf, 501 U. S., at 363 (holding compa\nrable bar not subject to equitable tolling).\n   Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to\nrun prior to November 2001 because by that point the\nplaintiffs were on \u201cinquiry notice.\u201d Merck uses the term\n\u201cinquiry notice\u201d to refer to the point \u201cat which a plaintiff\npossesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive\nof wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of\nAppeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See,\ne.g., Franze v.

Nothing in the text sug\ngests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d can take place. Merck points out that, as we\nhave discussed, see supra, at 8\u20139, the court-created \u201cdiscov\nery rule\u201d exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not\ngenerally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their\nclaims with reasonable diligence.

REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cdiscovery,\u201d when a plaintiff would have begun investigat\ning, we cannot accept Merck\u2019s argument.\n   As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations\nperiod does generally begin at \u201cdiscovery,\u201d it should none\ntheless run from the point of \u201cinquiry notice\u201d in one par\nticular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to\nundertake an investigation once placed on \u201cinquiry no\ntice.\u201d In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual\nplaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not \u201ceffectively\nexcuse a plaintiff\u2019s failure to conduct a further investiga\ntion\u201d by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff \u201cin the same position.\u201d Brief for Petition\ners 48.\n   We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same\nreason we reject \u201cinquiry notice\u201d as the standard gener\nally: We cannot reconcile it with the statute, which simply\nprovides that \u201cdiscovery\u201d is the event that triggers the 2\nyear limitations period\u2014for all plaintiffs. Cf. United\nStates v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935) (\u201cLaches within\nthe term of the statute of limitations is no defense at\nlaw\u201d). Furthermore, the statute does not place all plain\ntiffs \u201cin the same position\u201d no matter whether they inves\ntigate when investigation is warranted. The limitations\nperiod puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on \u201cin\nquiry notice\u201d at a disadvantage because it lapses two years\nafter a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered\nthe necessary facts. A plaintiff who fails entirely to inves\ntigate or delays investigating may well not have discov\nered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have\nfound sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a \u00a710(b)\ncomplaint that satisfies the applicable heightened plead\ning standards. Cf. Young v. Lepone, 305 F. 3d 1, 9 (CA1\n2002) (\u201c[A] reasonably diligent investigation . . . may\nconsume as little as a few days or as much as a few years\nto get to the bottom of the matter\u201d).\n   Merck further contends that its proposed \u201cinquiry no\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntice\u201d standard is superior, because determining when a\nhypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\n\u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the necessary facts is too complicated for\njudges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional\ndiscovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad\ncircumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already\nask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See,\ne.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F. 3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New\nEngland Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 501; Young, supra, at\n1, 9\u201310; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F. 3d 1191, 1201\n(CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer Centers, Inc., 122\nF. 3d 363, 367\u2013368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this\nprecedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that\nthe \u201cdiscovery\u201d of facts that put a plaintiff on \u201cinquiry\nnotice\u201d does not automatically begin the running of the\nlimitations period.\n\n  We conclude that the limitations period in \u00a71658(b)(1)\nbegins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasona\nbly diligent plaintiff would have \u201cdiscover[ed] the facts\nconstituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever comes first. In\ndetermining the time at which \u201cdiscovery\u201d of those \u201cfacts\u201d\noccurred, terms such as \u201cinquiry notice\u201d and \u201cstorm warn\nings\u201d may be useful to the extent that they identify a time\nwhen the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent\nplaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period\ndoes not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discov\ners or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discov\nered \u201cthe facts constituting the violation,\u201d including sci\nenter\u2014irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff\nundertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n                            IV\n  Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal\narguments fail, the record still shows that, before Novem\n18               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nber 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have\ndiscovered \u201cthe facts constituting the violation.\u201d In re\nspect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA\u2019s\nSeptember 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck\nhad \u201c \u2018minimized\u2019 \u201d the VIGOR study\u2019s \u201c \u2018potentially serious\ncardiovascular findings\u2019 \u201d and (2) pleadings filed in prod\nucts-liability actions in September and October 2001\nalleging that Merck had \u201c \u2018omitted, suppressed, or con\ncealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks\nassociated with Vioxx\u2019 \u201d and \u201cpurposefully downplayed\nand/or understated the serious nature of the risks associ\nated with Vioxx.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 36\u201337 (quoting\nApp. 340, 893).\n   The FDA\u2019s warning letter, however, shows little or\nnothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether\nMerck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent\nintent. See Part I\u2013A(4), supra. The FDA itself described\nthe pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a \u201cpossible explana\ntion\u201d for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing\nsufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to\nMerck, that Vioxx might be harmful. App. 340.\n   The products-liability complaints\u2019 statements about\nMerck\u2019s knowledge show little more. See Part I\u2013A(3),\nsupra. Merck does not claim that these complaints con\ntained any specific information suggesting the fraud al\nleged here, i.e., that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis\nwas false even as it promoted it. And, without providing\nany reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access\nto information about Merck\u2019s state of mind, the complaints\nalleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed\ninformation about Vioxx and \u201cpurposefully downplayed\nand/or understated\u201d the risks associated with Vioxx\u2014the\nsame charge made in the FDA warning letter.

Regardless of\nwhich, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001,\nconstituted \u201cdiscovery,\u201d we need only conclude that prior\nto November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff\nwould have discovered, \u201cthe facts constituting the viola\ntion.\u201d In light of our interpretation of the statute, our\nholdings in respect to scienter, and our application of\nthose holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must,\nand we do, reach that conclusion. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 suit\nis timely. We need not\u2014and do not\u2014pass upon the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham\nand Women\u2019s study might have triggered the statute of\nlimitations.

S. C. \u00a778j(b), must be brought within\n\u201c(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation\u201d or \u201c(2) 5 years after such violation,\u201d whichever\ncomes first. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1). I agree with the\nCourt that scienter is among the \u201cfacts constituting the\nviolation\u201d that a plaintiff must \u201cdiscove[r]\u201d for the limita\ntions period to begin. Ante, at 12\u201314 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I also agree that respondents\u2019 suit is\ntimely, but for a reason different from the Court\u2019s: Merck\nhas not shown that respondents actually \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d\nscienter more than two years before bringing suit.\n   In ordinary usage, \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs when one actually\nlearns something new. See Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)\n(defining \u201cdiscovery\u201d as \u201c[f]inding out or ascertaining\nsomething previously unknown or unrecognized\u201d). As the\nCourt notes, however, ante, at 8\u201310, in the context of\nstatutes of limitations \u201cdiscovery\u201d has long carried an\nadditional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer\ncising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the\nfacts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,\n101 U. S. 135, 140\u2013142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of\n2                MERCK & CO. v.

Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola\ntion, \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1) might mean constructive\ndiscovery.\n   In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13\nof the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab\nlished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under \u00a7\u00a711\nand 12 of that Act:\n    \u201cNo action shall be maintained to enforce any liability\n    created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title\n    unless brought within one year after the discovery of\n    the untrue statement or the omission, or after such\n    discovery should have been made by the exercise of\n    reasonable diligence . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a777m.\n\u201c[D]iscovery\u201d in \u00a777m obviously cannot mean constructive\ndiscovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase\n\u201cor after such discovery should have been made by the\nexercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Ibid. With \u00a777m al\nready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in\nthe 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a778i(e), 78r(c), that did not\ncontain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab\nlished a time bar that runs from \u201cdiscovery\u201d simpliciter.\nWhen Congress enacted \u00a71658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing\na limitations period for private actions for \u201cfraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws,\u201d specifi\ncally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery\ncaveat. To interpret \u00a71658(b)(1) as imposing a construc\ntive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con\ntrary to common sense, that the same word means two\nvery different things in the same statutory context of\nlimitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the\n1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   True, the sensible presumption that a word means the\nsame thing when it appears more than once in the same\nstatutory context\u2014or even in the very same statute\u2014is\nrebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 595\u2013596 (2004). Context may make\nclear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,\nand in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596\u2013\n597. But nothing in the context of \u00a777m or \u00a71658(b)(1)\nsuggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita\ntions periods for federal-law claims based on various false\nstatements or omissions involving securities. The former\napplies to false statements or omissions in registration\nstatements, \u00a777k, and offers to sell securities, \u00a777l(a)(2);\nthe broad language of the latter (\u201cclaim[s] of fraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws\u201d) covers\nother \u201cmanipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv\nance[s]\u201d made \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale\u201d of\na security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com\nmission regulations, \u00a778j(b), including SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17\nCFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b) (2009). There is good reason, more\nover, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private\n\u00a710(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive\ndiscovery rule for claims governed by \u00a777m: The elements\nof \u00a710(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more\ndifficult to discover than the elements of claims under\n\u00a777k or \u00a777l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman & MacLean\nv. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 382 (1983); Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 208\u2013209 (1976); In re Morgan\nStanley Information Fund Securities Litigation, 592 F. 3d\n347, 359 (CA2 2010). And a constructive-discovery stan\ndard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by \u00a777m.\nDetermining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an\nuntrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus\nis much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should\nhave learned that the defendant deliberately misled him\n4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusing a deceptive device covered by \u00a710(b).1\n   Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that\nwarrants giving \u201cdiscovery\u201d two meanings, the Court\nrelies on the historical treatment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in limita\ntions periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporat\ning a constructive-discovery rule. Ante, at 8\u201310, 12. But\nthat history proves only that \u201cdiscovery\u201d can carry that\ntechnical meaning, and that without \u00a777m it would be\nreasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.\nIt does not show what \u201cdiscovery\u201d means in \u00a71658(b)(1) in\nlight of \u00a777m\u2019s codification of a constructive-discovery\nrule. In my view, the meaning of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the\nbroader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its\nmeaning in the more specific context of the federal securi\nties laws.\n   The Court\u2019s other reason for rejecting the more natural\nreading of \u00a71658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the\nCourts of Appeals before the provision\u2019s enactment. Ante,\nat 11\u201312. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.\nGilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we\nexplicitly adopted the terms of \u00a778i(e)\u2014which like\n\u00a71658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of\nreasonable diligence\u2014as the limitations period for the\nprivate \u00a710(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court appears to believe that \u00a777m\u2019s distinction between actual\n\nand constructive discovery has no bearing on \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s meaning\nbecause the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at\n11\u201312. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word\n(\u201cdiscovery\u201d) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;\nand its use in \u00a777m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.\n  The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes\nare irrelevant, ante, at 11\u201312, but of course it does not believe that. Its\nentire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state\nlegislatures), ante, at 8\u201310. Yet while the Court considers that broader\ncontext, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific\ncontext of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Congress\u2019s collective intent (if such\na thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in\nany event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent\napart from reading the text. See Graham County Soil and\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,\n559 U.

If that were true, one could\nsay that those decisions had established the public mean\ning of the term in this context\u2014whether Congress knew of\n(or agreed with) that meaning or not. Jerman v.

To the con\ntrary, the fact that in enacting \u00a71658(b)(1) Congress did not copy\n\u00a777m\u2019s constructive-discovery proviso\u2014but decreed instead that \u201cdis\ncovery\u201d alone starts the clock (as it had done in \u00a778i(e), which we\nborrowed in Lampf)\u2014is what makes equating \u00a777m and \u00a71658(b)(1) so\nimplausible.\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nin judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1).\n   But as amici note, that is not so. See Brief for Faculty\nat Law and Business Schools as Amici Curiae 23\u201329 (here\ninafter Faculty Brief). Some circuit cases cited by the\nCourt and amici can conceivably be read as interpreting\nthe language Lampf adopted from \u00a778i(e) as imposing\nsome form of constructive discovery. See Theoharous v.\nFong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001); Menowitz v.\nBrown, 991 F. 2d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) (per curiam); Howard\nv.

S. 978 (1992).\nOthers, however, cannot be so construed. Two were not\ninterpreting \u00a778i(e) at all, but looked directly to \u00a777m,\ndespite Lampf\u2019s explicit selection of \u00a778i(e)\u2019s terms.

Another\ncourt candidly acknowledged that \u00a778i(e)\u2019s text\u2014unlike\n\u00a777m\u2019s\u2014forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonethe\nless held that courts remain \u201cfree to apply to [\u00a778i(e)] the\njudge-made doctrine of inquiry notice\u201d as a \u201cmodest and\ntraditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,\u201d since \u201cCon\ngress could not have known when it enacted [\u00a778i(e)] that\nthis section would someday provide the statute of limita\ntions for a wide range of securities frauds.\u201d Tregenza v.\nGreat American Communications Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721\u2013\n722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).\n   The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the\nissue before \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s enactment.

And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt\non a constructive-discovery view in dicta\u2014of which the\nomniscient Congress of the Court\u2019s imagining should also\nhave been aware. See Berry v. Valence Technology, Inc.,\n175 F. 3d 699, 703\u2013705 (CA9 1999); Gruber v. Price Water\nhouse, 911 F. 2d 960, 964, n. 4 (CA3 1990).\n   This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere\nnear establishing that the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a778i(e)\nmeant constructive rather than actual discovery despite\n\u00a777m. Absent any textual or contextual reason to read\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d differently in \u00a71658(b)(1) and \u00a777m, I would\nhold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limita\ntions period for \u00a710(b) claims. Since Merck points to no\nevidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter\nmore than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with\nthe Court that the suit was not time barred.\n   Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral\nArg. 29, and their amici imply, see Faculty Brief 33\u201334,\nthat in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any\ndifference between actual and constructive discovery\nbecause of the presumption of reliance applicable in such\ncases, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 247 (1988).\nIt seems to me Basic has no bearing on the question dis\ncussed here. A presumption of reliance upon market-price\nsignals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public\ninformation, much less knowledge of nonpublic informa\ntion that a reasonably diligent investor would have inde\npendently uncovered. In any event, whether or not a\nconstructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield\nthe same result, actual discovery is what \u00a71658(b)(1)\nrequires to start the limitations period.\n",

Argued November 30, 2009\u2014Decided April 27, 2010\nOn November 6, 2003, respondent investors filed a securities fraud ac\n tion under \u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging\n that petitioner Merck & Co. knowingly misrepresented the heart\n attack risks associated with its drug Vioxx. A securities fraud com\n plaint is timely if filed no more than \u201c2 years after the discovery of\n the facts constituting the violation\u201d or 5 years after the violation. 28\n U. S. C. \u00a71658(b). The District Court dismissed the complaint as un\n timely because the plaintiffs should have been alerted to the possibil\n ity of Merck\u2019s misrepresentations prior to November 2001, more than\n 2 years before the complaint was filed, and they had failed to under\n take a reasonably diligent investigation at that time. Among the\n relevant circumstances were (1) a March 2000 \u201cVIGOR\u201d study com\n paring Vioxx with the painkiller naproxen and showing adverse car\n diovascular results for Vioxx, which Merck suggested might be due to\n the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than a harm\n caused by Vioxx (the naproxen hypothesis); (2) an FDA warning let\n ter, released to the public on September 21, 2001, saying that Merck\u2019s\n Vioxx marketing with regard to the cardiovascular results was \u201cfalse,\n lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading\u201d; and (3) pleadings\n filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 al\n leging that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and inten\n tionally downplayed its risks. The Third Circuit reversed, holding\n that the pre-November 2001 events did not suggest that Merck acted\n with scienter, an element of a \u00a710(b) violation, and consequently did\n not commence the running of the limitations period.\nHeld:\n    1. The limitations period in \u00a71658(b)(1) begins to run once the\n plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n2                      MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    have \u201cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever\n    comes first. In the statute of limitations context, \u201cdiscovery\u201d is often\n    used as a term of art in connection with the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d a doc\n    trine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has\n    \u201cdiscovered\u201d it. The rule arose in fraud cases but has been applied by\n    state and federal courts in other types of claims, and legislatures\n    have sometimes codified this rule. When \u201cdiscovery\u201d is written di\n    rectly into a statute, courts have typically interpreted the word to re\n    fer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery\n    of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. Congress in\n    tended courts to interpret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1) simi\n    larly. That statute was enacted after this Court determined a gov\n    erning limitations period for private \u00a710(b) actions, Lampf, Pleva,\n    Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350, concluding\n    that such actions \u201cmust be commenced within one year after the dis\n    covery of the facts constituting the violation . . . ,\u201d id., at 364 (empha\n    sis added). Since then, Courts of Appeals deciding the matter have\n    held that \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs both when a plaintiff actually discovers\n    the facts and when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\n    have discovered them. In 2002, Congress repeated Lampf\u2019s critical\n    language in enacting the present limitations statute. Normally,\n    when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial prece\n    dent. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116\u2013\n    117, and n. 13. Given the history and precedent surrounding the use\n    of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the limitations context generally as well as in this\n    provision, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly\n    strong here. Merck\u2019s claims are evaluated accordingly. Pp. 8\u201312.\n       2. In determining the time at which \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs, terms such\n    as \u201cinquiry notice\u201d and \u201cstorm warnings\u201d may be useful insofar as\n    they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasona\n    bly diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations pe\n    riod does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a\n    reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered \u201cthe facts consti\n    tuting the violation,\u201d including scienter\u2014irrespective of whether the\n    actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n    Pp. 12\u201317.\n          (a) Contrary to Merck\u2019s argument, facts showing scienter are\n    among those that \u201cconstitut[e] the violation.\u201d Scienter is assuredly a\n    \u201cfact.\u201d In a \u00a710(b) action, it refers to \u201ca mental state embracing in\n    tent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n    425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12, and \u201cconstitut[es]\u201d an important and neces\n    sary element of a \u00a710(b) \u201cviolation.\u201d See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues\n    & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319. Because the scienter element of\n    \u00a710(b) fraud cases has special heightened pleading requirements, see\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                         3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2), unless a \u00a710(b) complaint sets forth facts show\ning that it is \u201cat least as likely as not\u201d that the defendant acted with the\nrelevant intent, the claim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328 (emphasis de\nleted). It would frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule codified in\n\u00a71658(b)(1) if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a\nplaintiff had \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d any facts suggesting scienter. Pp. 12\u201314.\n      (b) The Court also rejects Merck\u2019s argument that, even if \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a mate\nrially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordi\nnarily sufficient to show scienter. Where \u00a710(b) is at issue, the\nrelation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific.\nFor instance, an incorrect prediction about a firm\u2019s future earnings,\nby itself, does not automatically show whether the speaker deliber\nately lied or made an innocent error. Hence, \u201cdiscovery\u201d of additional\nscienter-related facts may be required. The statute\u2019s inclusion of an\nunqualified bar on actions instituted \u201c5 years after such violation,\u201d\n\u00a71658(b)(2), should diminish Merck\u2019s fear that this requirement will\ngive life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts\ntaken long ago. P. 14.\n      (c) And the Court cannot accept Merck\u2019s argument that the limi\ntations period begins at \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d meaning the point where\nthe facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate fur\nther, because that point is not necessarily the point at which the\nplaintiff would already have \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d facts showing scienter or\nother \u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d The statute says that the\nplaintiff\u2019s claim accrues only after the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of those latter\nfacts. It contains no indication that the limitations period can some\ntimes begin before \u201cdiscovery\u201d can take place. Merck also argues that\ndetermining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would\nhave \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the necessary facts is too complicated for judges\nto undertake. But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have\nlong had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown and done in myriad circumstances and already undertake this\nkind of inquiry in securities fraud cases. Pp. 14\u201317.\n   3. Prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered, \u201cthe facts constituting the violation.\u201d The FDA\u2019s Septem\nber 2001 warning letter shows little or nothing about the here\nrelevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck advanced the naproxen hy\npothesis with fraudulent intent. The FDA itself described the hy\npothesis as a \u201cpossible explanation\u201d for the VIGOR results, faulting\nMerck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the less favorable al\nternative, that Vioxx might be harmful. The products-liability com\nplaints\u2019 general statements about Merck\u2019s state of mind show little\n4                    MERCK & CO. v.

Thus, neither these circumstances nor any of the other pre-\n    November 2001 circumstances reveal \u201cfacts\u201d indicating the relevant\n    scienter.

The complaint was\ntimely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs\n\u201cdiscover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute\nfor the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1)\nwhen the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a rea\nsonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, \u201cthe facts\nconstituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever comes first. We\nalso hold that the \u201cfacts constituting the violation\u201d include\nthe fact of scienter, \u201ca mental state embracing intent to\ndeceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976). Applying this\nstandard, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 determination\nthat the complaint filed here was timely.\n                             I\n  The action before us involves a claim by a group of inves\ntors (the plaintiffs, respondents here) that Merck & Co.\nand others (the petitioners here, hereinafter Merck) know\ningly misrepresented the risks of heart attacks accompany\n2                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning the use of Merck\u2019s pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to\neconomic losses when the risks later became apparent).\nThe plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under\n\u00a710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat.\n891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j(b); SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17\nCFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b) (2009); Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.\nBroudo, 544 U. S. 336, 341\u2013342 (2005).\n   The applicable statute of limitations provides that a\n\u201cprivate right of action\u201d that, like the present action,\n\u201cinvolves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or con\ntrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement\nconcerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not\nlater than the earlier of\u2014\n   \u201c(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting\nthe violation; or\n   \u201c(2) 5 years after such violation.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b).\n   The complaint in this case was filed on November 6,\n2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years\nof the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for\ntimeliness purposes is November 6, 2001\u2014two years\nbefore this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before\nthis date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the\n\u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d If so, by the time the\nplaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period\nin \u00a71658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had\nnot, and could not have, discovered by the critical date\nthose \u201cfacts,\u201d particularly not the facts related to scienter,\nand that their complaint was therefore timely.\n                            A\n  We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts,\nas we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and\nthe opinions below.\n  1. 1990\u2019s. In the mid-1990\u2019s Merck developed Vioxx. In\n1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it\nfor prescription use. Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe body\u2019s production of an enzyme called COX\u20132 (cyclooxy-\ngenase-2). COX\u20132 is associated with pain and inflamma-\ntion. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its\nclass like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not\ninhibit production of a second enzyme called COX\u20131\n(cyclooxygenase-1). COX\u20131 plays a part in the functioning\nof the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation\n(associated with blood clots). App. 50\u201351.\n   2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study,\ncalled the \u201cVIGOR\u201d study. Id., at 291\u2013294. The study\ncompared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The\nstudy showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer\ngastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But\nthe study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every\n1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks,\ncompared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took\nnaproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Com-\nparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib\nand Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343\nNew England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526\u20131527 (2000).\n   Merck\u2019s press release acknowledged VIGOR\u2019s adverse\ncardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were\n\u201cconsistent with naproxen\u2019s ability to block platelet aggre-\ngation.\u201d App. 291. Merck noted that, since \u201cVioxx, like all\nCOX\u20132 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggre-\ngation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.\u201d\nIbid. And Merck added that \u201csafety data from all other\ncompleted and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indica-\ntion of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic\nevents between Vioxx\u201d and either a placebo or comparable\ndrugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).\n   This theory\u2014that VIGOR\u2019s troubling cardiovascular\nfindings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred\nby naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx\u2014\nlater became known as the \u201cnaproxen hypothesis.\u201d In\nadvancing that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the\n4                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nnaproxen benefit \u201chad not been observed previously.\u201d Id.,\nat 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all\nof the above\u2014the positive gastrointestinal results, the\ntroubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis,\nand the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved.\nSee id., at 355\u2013391, 508\u2013557.\n   3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about\nthe naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the\nFDA\u2019s Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider\nMerck\u2019s request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect\nVIGOR\u2019s positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR\ncardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392\u2013\n395, 558\u2013577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a\nproducts-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that\n\u201cMerck\u2019s own research\u201d had demonstrated that \u201cusers of\nVioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as\ncompared to other less expensive, medications.\u201d Id., at\n869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation wrote that the available data raised a \u201ccau\ntionary flag\u201d and strongly urged that \u201ca trial specifically\nassessing cardiovascular risk\u201d be done. Id., at 331\u2013332;\nMukherjee, Nissen, & Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular\nEvents Associated with Selective Cox-2 Inhibitors, 286\nJAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg\nNews quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck\nhad \u201cadditional data\u201d that were \u201cvery, very reassuring,\u201d\nand Merck issued a press release stating that it stood\n\u201cbehind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of\nVioxx.\u201d App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quota\ntion marks omitted).\n   4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a\nwarning letter released to the public on September 21,\n2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks,\nMerck\u2019s Vioxx marketing was \u201cfalse, lacking in fair bal\nance, or otherwise misleading.\u201d Id., at 339. At the same\ntime, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas a \u201cpossible explanation\u201d of the VIGOR results. Id., at\n340. But it found that Merck\u2019s \u201cpromotional campaign\nselectively present[ed]\u201d that hypothesis without adequately\nacknowledging \u201canother reasonable explanation,\u201d namely,\n\u201cthat Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardio\nvascular] properties.\u201d Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to\nsend healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.\n    After the FDA letter was released, more products\nliability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885\u2013956. Merck\u2019s\nshare price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832.\nBy October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October\n9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexam\nined its own data and \u201cfound no evidence that Vioxx in\ncreased the risk of heart attacks.\u201d App. 504. It quoted the\npresident of Merck Research Laboratories as positing\n\u201c \u2018two possible interpretations\u2019 \u201d: \u201c \u2018Naproxen lowers the\nheart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Stock ana\nlysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that\nthe FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis\nremained an unproven but possible explanation. See id.,\nat 614, 626, 628.\n                             B\n   We next set forth three important events that occurred\nafter the critical date.\n   1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the\nresults of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Bos\nton\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. After examining\nthe medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare pa\ntients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30-to\n90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart\nattack than those given either a different painkiller or no\npainkiller at all. Id., at 164\u2013165. (That is to say, if pa\ntients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at\nall suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of\npatients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.)\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMerck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study\u2019s limita\ntions. Id., at 165\u2013167.\n   2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the\nmarket. It said that a new study had found \u201can increased\nrisk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18\nmonths of continuous therapy.\u201d Id., at 182 (internal quo\ntation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly\ndescribed the results as \u201ctotally unexpected.\u201d Id., at 186.\nMerck\u2019s shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.\n   3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published\nan article stating that \u201cinternal Merck e-mails and mar\nketing materials as well as interviews with outside scien\ntists show that the company fought forcefully for years to\nkeep safety concerns from destroying the drug\u2019s commer\ncial prospects.\u201d Id., at 189\u2013190. The article said that an\nearly e-mail from Merck\u2019s head of research had said that\nthe VIGOR \u201cresults showed that the cardiovascular events\n\u2018are clearly there,\u2019 \u201d that it was \u201c \u2018a shame but . . . a low\nincidence,\u2019 \u201d and that it \u201c \u2018is mechanism based as we wor\nried it was.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had\ngiven its salespeople instructions to \u201c \u2018DODGE\u2019 \u201d questions\nabout Vioxx\u2019s cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.\n                             C\n   The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6,\n2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged\nthat Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the\nnaproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false.\nIt said, for example, that Merck \u201cknew, at least as early as\n1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,\u201d and that a\n\u201c1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . .\nserious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more\nfrequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a\ndifferent arthritis drug or placebo.\u201d Id., at 56, 58\u201359\n(emphasis and capitalization deleted).\n   Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nknown the \u201cfacts constituting the violation\u201d at least two\nyears earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it\nwas filed too late. The District Court granted the motion.\nThe court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the\n(September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck\u2019s (Octo\nber 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a\n\u201cpossibility that Merck had knowingly misrepresented\nmaterial facts\u201d no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing\nthe plaintiffs on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d to look further. In re\nMerck & Co. Securities, Derivative & \u201cERISA\u201d Litigation,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2334341\"><a href=\"/opinion/2334341/in-re-merck-co-inc-securities-derivative/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added).\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to \u201cshow that they\nexercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were\nunable to discover their injuries,\u201d the court took October 9,\n2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run\nand therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A\nmajority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while\nconstituting \u201cstorm warnings,\u201d did not suggest much by\nway of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs\non \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d requiring them to investigate further.\nIn re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & \u201cERISA\u201d Litiga\ntion, 543 F. 3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge consid\nered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the\n2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).\n   Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to dis\nagreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theo\nharous v. Fong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001) (limita\ntions period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs\non \u201cinquiry notice\u201d of the need for investigation), with\nShah v. Meeker, 435 F. 3d 244, 249 (CA2 2006) (same; but\nif plaintiff does investigate, period runs \u201cfrom the date\nsuch inquiry should have revealed the fraud\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)), and New England Health Care\nEmployees Pension Fund v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F. 3d\n495, 501 (CA6 2003) (limitations period always begins to\n8                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrun only when a reasonably diligent plaintiff, after being\nput on \u201cinquiry notice,\u201d should have discovered facts con\nstituting violation (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nWe granted Merck\u2019s petition.\n                             II\n  Before turning to Merck\u2019s arguments, we consider a\nmore basic matter. The parties and the Solicitor General\nagree that \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s word \u201cdiscovery\u201d refers not only to\na plaintiff\u2019s actual discovery of certain facts, but also to\nthe facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered. We agree. But because the statute\u2019s language\ndoes not make this interpretation obvious, and because we\ncannot answer the question presented without considering\nwhether the parties are right about this matter, we set\nforth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.\n\n   We recognize that one might read the statutory words\n\u201cafter the discovery of the facts constituting the violation\u201d\nas referring to the time a plaintiff actually discovered the\nrelevant facts. But in the statute of limitations context,\nthe word \u201cdiscovery\u201d is often used as a term of art in con\nnection with the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d a doctrine that delays\naccrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has \u201cdiscov\nered\u201d it. The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to\nthe general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues\nonce a plaintiff has a \u201ccomplete and present cause of ac\ntion,\u201d Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust\nFund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997)\n(citing Clark v.

This Court long ago recog\nnized that something different was needed in the case of\nfraud, where a defendant\u2019s deceptive conduct may prevent\na plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been\ndefrauded.

Accordingly, \u201cwhere a plaintiff has been\ninjured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without\nany fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar\nof the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is\ndiscovered.\u201d Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397\n(1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis\nadded). And for more than a century, courts have under\nstood that \u201c[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in\nthe exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been\ndiscovered.\u201d 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions \u00a7276b(11),\np. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401\u20131403, and nn. 74\u2013\n84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg,\nsupra, at 397; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern\nR. Co., 120 U. S. 130, 138 (1887) (The rule \u201cregard[s] the\ncause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud\nwas or should have been discovered\u201d).\n  More recently, both state and federal courts have ap\nplied forms of the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d to claims other than\nfraud. See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a7\u00a711.1.2.1,\n11.1.2.3, pp. 136\u2013142, and nn. 6\u201313, 18\u201323 (1991 and 1993\nSupp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111 (1979). Legisla\ntures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts.\n2 Corman \u00a711.2, at 170\u2013171, and nn. 1\u20139 (collecting stat\nutes); see, e.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a72409a(g) (actions to quiet title\nagainst the United States). In doing so, legislators have\nwritten the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d directly into the statute. And\nwhen they have done so, state and federal courts have\ntypically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual\ndiscovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a\nreasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g., Pea\ncock v. Barnes, 142 N. C. 215, 217\u2013220, 55 S. E. 99, 100\n(1906); Davis v.

Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit \u00a7347, p. 354 (2001 and\nSupp. 2009) (noting that the various formulations of \u201cdis\ncovery\u201d all provide that \u201cin addition to actual knowledge of\nthe fraud, once a reasonably diligent party is in a position\nthat they should have sufficient knowledge or information\nto have actually discovered the fraud, they are charged\nwith discovery\u201d); id., at 354\u2013355, and nn. 2\u201311 (collecting\ncases).\n   Like the parties, we believe that Congress intended\ncourts to interpret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1)\nsimilarly. Before Congress enacted that statute, this\nCourt, having found in the federal securities laws the\nexistence of an implied private \u00a710(b) action, determined\nits governing limitations period by looking to other limita\ntions periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva,\nLipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350\n(1991). Noting the existence of various formulations\n\u201cdiffer[ing] slightly in terminology,\u201d the Court chose the\nlanguage in 15 U. S. C. \u00a778i(e), the statutory provision\nthat governs securities price manipulation claims. 501\nU. S., at 364, n. 9. And in doing so, the Court said that\nprivate \u00a710(b) actions \u201cmust be commenced within one\nyear after the discovery of the facts constituting the viola\ntion and within three years after such violation.\u201d Id., at\n364 (emphasis added). (The Court listed among the vari\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nous formulations the one in 15 U. S. C. \u00a777m, on which the\nconcurrence relies. See post, at 2\u20134 (SCALIA, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360,\nand n. 7 (quoting \u00a777m).)\n  Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the\nmatter held that \u201cdiscovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation\u201d occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discov\ners the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have discovered them. See, e.g.,\nLaw v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F. 3d 781, 785\u2013786 (CA7\n1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F. 3d 346, 350,\n353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation,\n306 F. 3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases).\nSome of those courts noted that other limitations provi\nsions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that\nthe period begins to run \u201c \u2018after the discovery of the untrue\nstatement . . . or after such discovery should have been\nmade by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,\u2019 \u201d whereas\nthe formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting\n\u00a777m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at\n364, n. 9. But, courts reasoned, because the term \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long\nbeen understood to include discoveries a reasonably dili\ngent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit\nprovision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at\n721; accord, New England Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 499\u2013\n500.\n  In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations\nstatute, it repeated Lampf\u2019s critical language. The statute\nsays that an action based on fraud \u201cmay be brought not\nlater than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of\nthe facts constituting the violation\u201d (or \u201c5 years after such\nviolation\u201d). \u00a7804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801,\ncodified at 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b) (emphasis added). (This\nstatutory provision does not make the linguistic distinc\n12               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntion that the concurrence finds in a different statute,\n\u00a777m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an\naction be brought \u201cthree years after the earliest date on\nwhich the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or\nviolation\u201d (emphasis added)).)      Not surprisingly, the\nCourts of Appeals unanimously have continued to inter\npret the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in this statute as including not\nonly facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts\nany reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g.,\nStaehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F. 3d\n406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne\nParish Consolidated Govt., 503 F. 3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).\n   We normally assume that, when Congress enacts stat\nutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g.,\nEdelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U. S. 106, 116\u2013117,\nand n. 13 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus\ntries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 159 (1993). Given the history\nand precedent surrounding the use of the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d\nin the limitations context generally as well as in this\nprovision in particular, the reasons for making this as\nsumption are particularly strong here. We consequently\nhold that \u201cdiscovery\u201d as used in this statute encompasses\nnot only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also\nthose facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\nknown. And we evaluate Merck\u2019s claims accordingly.\n                             III\n   We turn now to Merck\u2019s arguments in favor of holding\nthat petitioners\u2019 claims accrued before November 6, 2001.\nFirst, Merck argues that the statute does not require\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of scienter-related \u201cfacts.\u201d See Brief for Peti\ntioners 19\u201328.

S., at 194,\nn. 12. And the \u201c \u2018state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as\nthe state of his digestion.\u2019 \u201d Postal Service Bd. of Gover\nnors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983) (quoting Edging\nton v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).\n   And this \u201cfact\u201d of scienter \u201cconstitut[es]\u201d an important\nand necessary element of a \u00a710(b) \u201cviolation.\u201d A plaintiff\ncannot recover without proving that a defendant made a\nmaterial misstatement with an intent to deceive\u2014not\nmerely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v.\nMakor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308, 319 (2007);\nErnst & Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted\nspecial heightened pleading requirements for the scienter\nelement of \u00a710(b) fraud cases. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20134(b)(2)\n(requiring plaintiffs to \u201cstate with particularity facts\ngiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted\nwith the required state of mind\u201d (emphasis added)). As a\nresult, unless a \u00a710(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the\ncomplaint showing that it is \u201cat least as likely as\u201d not that the\ndefendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the\nclaim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328 (emphasis deleted). It\nwould therefore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery\nrule in this provision\u2014which, after all, specifically applies\nonly in cases \u201cinvolv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipu\nlation, or contrivance,\u201d \u00a71658(b)\u2014if the limitations period\nbegan to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discov\nered any facts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant\nconcealed for two years that he made a misstatement with\nan intent to deceive, the limitations period would expire\nbefore the plaintiff had actually \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the fraud.\n   We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are\namong those that \u201cconstitut[e] the violation.\u201d In so hold\ning, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support\n14               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na private \u00a710(b) action. Cf. Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 12, n. 1 (suggesting that facts concerning a\nplaintiff\u2019s reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among\nthose that constitute \u201cthe violation\u201d and therefore need not\nbe \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d for a claim to accrue).\n   Second, Merck argues that, even if \u201cdiscovery\u201d requires\nfacts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materi\nally false or misleading statement (or material omission)\nare ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well. See\nBrief for Petitioners 22, 28\u201329. But we do not see how\nthat is so. We recognize that certain statements are such\nthat, to show them false is normally to show scienter as\nwell. It is unlikely, for example, that someone would\nfalsely say \u201cI am not married\u201d without being aware of the\nfact that his statement is false. Where \u00a710(b) is at issue,\nhowever, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is\nmore context specific. An incorrect prediction about a\nfirm\u2019s future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell\nus whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an\ninnocent (and therefore nonactionable) error. Hence, the\nstatute may require \u201cdiscovery\u201d of scienter-related facts\nbeyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be\nmaterially false or misleading. Merck fears that this\nrequirement will give life to stale claims or subject defen\ndants to liability for acts taken long ago. But Congress\u2019\ninclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions\ninstituted \u201c5 years after such violation,\u201d \u00a71658(b)(2), giv\ning defendants total repose after five years, should dimin\nish that fear. Cf. Lampf, 501 U. S., at 363 (holding compa\nrable bar not subject to equitable tolling).\n   Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to\nrun prior to November 2001 because by that point the\nplaintiffs were on \u201cinquiry notice.\u201d Merck uses the term\n\u201cinquiry notice\u201d to refer to the point \u201cat which a plaintiff\npossesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive\nof wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of\nAppeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See,\ne.g., Franze v. Equitable Assurance, 296 F. 3d 1250, 1254\n(CA11 2002) (\u201c[I]nquiry notice [is] \u201c \u2018the term used for\nknowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\nbegin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had\nbeen infringed\u2019 \u201d). Cf. Dodds, 12 F. 3d, at 350 (\u201cduty of\ninquiry\u201d arises once \u201ccircumstances would suggest to an\ninvestor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she\nhad been defrauded\u201d); Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. v.\nKapoor, 115 F. 3d 1332, 1335\u20131336 (CA7 1997) (\u201cThe facts\nconstituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] . . . to\nincite the victim to investigate\u201d and \u201cto enable him to tie\nup any loose ends and complete the investigation in time\nto file a timely suit\u201d); Great Rivers Cooperative of South\neastern Iowa v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893,\n896 (CA8 1997) (\u201cInquiry notice exists when the victim is\naware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to\ninvestigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of\nthe defendant\u2019s misrepresentations\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   If the term \u201cinquiry notice\u201d refers to the point where the\nfacts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investi\ngate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which\nthe plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing\nscienter or other \u201cfacts constituting the violation.\u201d But the\nstatute says that the plaintiff\u2019s claim accrues only after the\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of those latter facts. Nothing in the text sug\ngests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d can take place. Merck points out that, as we\nhave discussed, see supra, at 8\u20139, the court-created \u201cdiscov\nery rule\u201d exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not\ngenerally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their\nclaims with reasonable diligence. But we are dealing here\nwith a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute.\nBecause the statute contains no indication that the limita\ntions period should occur at some earlier moment before\n16                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cdiscovery,\u201d when a plaintiff would have begun investigat\ning, we cannot accept Merck\u2019s argument.\n   As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations\nperiod does generally begin at \u201cdiscovery,\u201d it should none\ntheless run from the point of \u201cinquiry notice\u201d in one par\nticular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to\nundertake an investigation once placed on \u201cinquiry no\ntice.\u201d In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual\nplaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not \u201ceffectively\nexcuse a plaintiff\u2019s failure to conduct a further investiga\ntion\u201d by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff \u201cin the same position.\u201d Brief for Petition\ners 48.\n   We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same\nreason we reject \u201cinquiry notice\u201d as the standard gener\nally: We cannot reconcile it with the statute, which simply\nprovides that \u201cdiscovery\u201d is the event that triggers the 2\nyear limitations period\u2014for all plaintiffs. Cf. United\nStates v. Mack, 295 U. S. 480, 489 (1935) (\u201cLaches within\nthe term of the statute of limitations is no defense at\nlaw\u201d). Furthermore, the statute does not place all plain\ntiffs \u201cin the same position\u201d no matter whether they inves\ntigate when investigation is warranted. The limitations\nperiod puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on \u201cin\nquiry notice\u201d at a disadvantage because it lapses two years\nafter a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered\nthe necessary facts. A plaintiff who fails entirely to inves\ntigate or delays investigating may well not have discov\nered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have\nfound sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a \u00a710(b)\ncomplaint that satisfies the applicable heightened plead\ning standards. Cf. Young v. Lepone, 305 F. 3d 1, 9 (CA1\n2002) (\u201c[A] reasonably diligent investigation . . . may\nconsume as little as a few days or as much as a few years\nto get to the bottom of the matter\u201d).\n   Merck further contends that its proposed \u201cinquiry no\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntice\u201d standard is superior, because determining when a\nhypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\n\u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d the necessary facts is too complicated for\njudges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional\ndiscovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably\ndiligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad\ncircumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already\nask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See,\ne.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F. 3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New\nEngland Health Care, 336 F. 3d, at 501; Young, supra, at\n1, 9\u201310; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F. 3d 1191, 1201\n(CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer Centers, Inc., 122\nF. 3d 363, 367\u2013368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this\nprecedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that\nthe \u201cdiscovery\u201d of facts that put a plaintiff on \u201cinquiry\nnotice\u201d does not automatically begin the running of the\nlimitations period.\n\n  We conclude that the limitations period in \u00a71658(b)(1)\nbegins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasona\nbly diligent plaintiff would have \u201cdiscover[ed] the facts\nconstituting the violation\u201d\u2014whichever comes first. In\ndetermining the time at which \u201cdiscovery\u201d of those \u201cfacts\u201d\noccurred, terms such as \u201cinquiry notice\u201d and \u201cstorm warn\nings\u201d may be useful to the extent that they identify a time\nwhen the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent\nplaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period\ndoes not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discov\ners or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discov\nered \u201cthe facts constituting the violation,\u201d including sci\nenter\u2014irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff\nundertook a reasonably diligent investigation.\n                            IV\n  Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal\narguments fail, the record still shows that, before Novem\n18               MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nber 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have\ndiscovered \u201cthe facts constituting the violation.\u201d In re\nspect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA\u2019s\nSeptember 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck\nhad \u201c \u2018minimized\u2019 \u201d the VIGOR study\u2019s \u201c \u2018potentially serious\ncardiovascular findings\u2019 \u201d and (2) pleadings filed in prod\nucts-liability actions in September and October 2001\nalleging that Merck had \u201c \u2018omitted, suppressed, or con\ncealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks\nassociated with Vioxx\u2019 \u201d and \u201cpurposefully downplayed\nand/or understated the serious nature of the risks associ\nated with Vioxx.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 36\u201337 (quoting\nApp. 340, 893).\n   The FDA\u2019s warning letter, however, shows little or\nnothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether\nMerck advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent\nintent. See Part I\u2013A(4), supra. The FDA itself described\nthe pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a \u201cpossible explana\ntion\u201d for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing\nsufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to\nMerck, that Vioxx might be harmful. App. 340.\n   The products-liability complaints\u2019 statements about\nMerck\u2019s knowledge show little more. See Part I\u2013A(3),\nsupra. Merck does not claim that these complaints con\ntained any specific information suggesting the fraud al\nleged here, i.e., that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis\nwas false even as it promoted it. And, without providing\nany reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access\nto information about Merck\u2019s state of mind, the complaints\nalleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed\ninformation about Vioxx and \u201cpurposefully downplayed\nand/or understated\u201d the risks associated with Vioxx\u2014the\nsame charge made in the FDA warning letter.

Regardless of\nwhich, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001,\nconstituted \u201cdiscovery,\u201d we need only conclude that prior\nto November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and\nMerck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff\nwould have discovered, \u201cthe facts constituting the viola\ntion.\u201d In light of our interpretation of the statute, our\nholdings in respect to scienter, and our application of\nthose holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must,\nand we do, reach that conclusion. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 suit\nis timely. We need not\u2014and do not\u2014pass upon the Court\nof Appeals\u2019 suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham\nand Women\u2019s study might have triggered the statute of\nlimitations.

C. \u00a778j(b), must be brought within\n\u201c(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the\nviolation\u201d or \u201c(2) 5 years after such violation,\u201d whichever\ncomes first. 28 U. S. C. \u00a71658(b)(1). I agree with the\nCourt that scienter is among the \u201cfacts constituting the\nviolation\u201d that a plaintiff must \u201cdiscove[r]\u201d for the limita\ntions period to begin. Ante, at 12\u201314 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). I also agree that respondents\u2019 suit is\ntimely, but for a reason different from the Court\u2019s: Merck\nhas not shown that respondents actually \u201cdiscover[ed]\u201d\nscienter more than two years before bringing suit.\n   In ordinary usage, \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs when one actually\nlearns something new. See Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1957)\n(defining \u201cdiscovery\u201d as \u201c[f]inding out or ascertaining\nsomething previously unknown or unrecognized\u201d). As the\nCourt notes, however, ante, at 8\u201310, in the context of\nstatutes of limitations \u201cdiscovery\u201d has long carried an\nadditional meaning: It also occurs when a plaintiff, exer\ncising reasonable diligence, should have discovered the\nfacts giving rise to his claim. See, e.g., Wood v. Carpenter,\n101 U. S. 135, 140\u2013142 (1879); 2 H. Wood, Limitations of\n2                MERCK & CO. v.

Rev. 591, 619, and n. 77 (1933). Read in isola\ntion, \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a71658(b)(1) might mean constructive\ndiscovery.\n   In context, however, I do not believe it can. Section 13\nof the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 84, explicitly estab\nlished a constructive-discovery rule for claims under \u00a7\u00a711\nand 12 of that Act:\n    \u201cNo action shall be maintained to enforce any liability\n    created under section 77k or 77l(a)(2) of this title\n    unless brought within one year after the discovery of\n    the untrue statement or the omission, or after such\n    discovery should have been made by the exercise of\n    reasonable diligence . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a777m.\n\u201c[D]iscovery\u201d in \u00a777m obviously cannot mean constructive\ndiscovery, since that would render superfluous the phrase\n\u201cor after such discovery should have been made by the\nexercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Ibid. With \u00a777m al\nready on the books, Congress added limitations periods in\nthe 1934 Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a778i(e), 78r(c), that did not\ncontain similar qualifying language; instead, each estab\nlished a time bar that runs from \u201cdiscovery\u201d simpliciter.\nWhen Congress enacted \u00a71658(b)(1) in 2002, establishing\na limitations period for private actions for \u201cfraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws,\u201d specifi\ncally including the 1933 and 1934 Acts, see 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778c(a)(47), it likewise included no constructive-discovery\ncaveat. To interpret \u00a71658(b)(1) as imposing a construc\ntive-discovery standard, one must therefore assume, con\ntrary to common sense, that the same word means two\nvery different things in the same statutory context of\nlimitations periods for securities-fraud actions under the\n1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n   True, the sensible presumption that a word means the\nsame thing when it appears more than once in the same\nstatutory context\u2014or even in the very same statute\u2014is\nrebuttable. See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.\nCline, 540 U. S. 581, 595\u2013596 (2004). Context may make\nclear that in one instance the word carries one meaning,\nand in a second instance another. See, e.g., id., at 596\u2013\n597. But nothing in the context of \u00a777m or \u00a71658(b)(1)\nsuggests that is the case. Both provisions impose limita\ntions periods for federal-law claims based on various false\nstatements or omissions involving securities. The former\napplies to false statements or omissions in registration\nstatements, \u00a777k, and offers to sell securities, \u00a777l(a)(2);\nthe broad language of the latter (\u201cclaim[s] of fraud, deceit,\nmanipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regula\ntory requirement concerning the securities laws\u201d) covers\nother \u201cmanipulative or deceptive device[s] or contriv\nance[s]\u201d made \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale\u201d of\na security in violation of Securities and Exchange Com\nmission regulations, \u00a778j(b), including SEC Rule 10b\u20135, 17\nCFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135(b) (2009). There is good reason, more\nover, for providing an actual-discovery rule for private\n\u00a710(b) claims but providing (explicitly) a constructive\ndiscovery rule for claims governed by \u00a777m: The elements\nof \u00a710(b) claims, which include scienter, are likely more\ndifficult to discover than the elements of claims under\n\u00a777k or \u00a777l(a)(2), which do not, see Herman & MacLean\nv. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 382 (1983); Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 208\u2013209 (1976); In re Morgan\nStanley Information Fund Securities Litigation, 592 F. 3d\n347, 359 (CA2 2010). And a constructive-discovery stan\ndard may be easier to apply to the claims covered by \u00a777m.\nDetermining when the plaintiff should have uncovered an\nuntrue assertion in a registration statement or prospectus\nis much simpler than assessing when a plaintiff should\nhave learned that the defendant deliberately misled him\n4                    MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nusing a deceptive device covered by \u00a710(b).1\n   Unable to identify anything in the statutory context that\nwarrants giving \u201cdiscovery\u201d two meanings, the Court\nrelies on the historical treatment of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in limita\ntions periods (particularly for fraud claims) as incorporat\ning a constructive-discovery rule. Ante, at 8\u201310, 12. But\nthat history proves only that \u201cdiscovery\u201d can carry that\ntechnical meaning, and that without \u00a777m it would be\nreasonable (other things equal) to read it that way here.\nIt does not show what \u201cdiscovery\u201d means in \u00a71658(b)(1) in\nlight of \u00a777m\u2019s codification of a constructive-discovery\nrule. In my view, the meaning of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the\nbroader context of limitations provisions is overcome by its\nmeaning in the more specific context of the federal securi\nties laws.\n   The Court\u2019s other reason for rejecting the more natural\nreading of \u00a71658(b)(1) rests on a consensus among the\nCourts of Appeals before the provision\u2019s enactment. Ante,\nat 11\u201312. In Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v.\nGilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991), the Court notes, we\nexplicitly adopted the terms of \u00a778i(e)\u2014which like\n\u00a71658(b)(1) refers only to discovery with no mention of\nreasonable diligence\u2014as the limitations period for the\nprivate \u00a710(b) cause of action we created. Id., at 364, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court appears to believe that \u00a777m\u2019s distinction between actual\n\nand constructive discovery has no bearing on \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s meaning\nbecause the latter does not itself draw the same distinction. Ante, at\n11\u201312. The point, however, is that both provisions use the same word\n(\u201cdiscovery\u201d) with no contextual clue that it carries different meanings;\nand its use in \u00a777m makes clear that the meaning is actual discovery.\n  The Court suggests that usages of the same word in other statutes\nare irrelevant, ante, at 11\u201312, but of course it does not believe that. Its\nentire argument rests on the meaning courts have ascribed to \u201cdiscov\nery\u201d in other limitations provisions (some enacted decades ago by state\nlegislatures), ante, at 8\u201310. Yet while the Court considers that broader\ncontext, it provides no explanation for ignoring the more specific\ncontext of securities-fraud claims under the 1933 and 1934 Acts.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nn. 9.2 Since every Circuit to address the issue between\nLampf and \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s enactment 11 years later had held\nconstructive discovery applicable to \u00a710(b) claims\u2014and\nsince Congress copied \u00a778i(e)\u2019s key text into \u00a71658(b)(1)\nwith no indication it intended to adopt a contrary rule\u2014the\nCourt assumes Congress meant to codify (or at least not to\ndisturb) that consensus. Ante, at 11\u201312.\n  Even assuming that Congress intended to incorporate\nthe Circuits\u2019 views\u2014which requires the further unrealistic\nassumption that a majority of each House knew of and\nagreed with the Courts of Appeals\u2019 opinions\u2014that would\nbe entirely irrelevant. Congress\u2019s collective intent (if such\na thing even exists) cannot trump the text it enacts, and in\nany event we have no reliable way to ascertain that intent\napart from reading the text. See Graham County Soil and\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).\n  The only way in which the Circuits\u2019 pre-2002 decisions\nmight bear on \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s meaning is if all (or nearly all)\nof the Circuits had interpreted \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a778i(e) to\nmean constructive discovery. If that were true, one could\nsay that those decisions had established the public mean\ning of the term in this context\u2014whether Congress knew of\n(or agreed with) that meaning or not. Jerman v. Carlisle,\nMcNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich LPA, 559 U. S. ___, ___,\nn. 1 (2010) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court notes that Lampf chose \u00a778i(e)\u2019s limitations period as the\n\ntime bar for \u00a710(b) claims, even though it was aware of \u00a777m, 501 U. S.,\nat 360, and n. 7, 364, and n. 9; see ante, at 10\u201311. But I fail to see how\nthat provides any support for the Court\u2019s interpretation. To the con\ntrary, the fact that in enacting \u00a71658(b)(1) Congress did not copy\n\u00a777m\u2019s constructive-discovery proviso\u2014but decreed instead that \u201cdis\ncovery\u201d alone starts the clock (as it had done in \u00a778i(e), which we\nborrowed in Lampf)\u2014is what makes equating \u00a777m and \u00a71658(b)(1) so\nimplausible.\n6                MERCK & CO. v. REYNOLDS\n\n                      Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nin judgment) (slip op., at 2, n. 1).\n   But as amici note, that is not so. See Brief for Faculty\nat Law and Business Schools as Amici Curiae 23\u201329 (here\ninafter Faculty Brief). Some circuit cases cited by the\nCourt and amici can conceivably be read as interpreting\nthe language Lampf adopted from \u00a778i(e) as imposing\nsome form of constructive discovery. See Theoharous v.\nFong, 256 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001); Menowitz v.\nBrown, 991 F. 2d 36, 41 (CA2 1993) (per curiam); Howard\nv. Haddad, 962 F. 2d 328, 329\u2013330 (CA4 1992); Anixter v.\nHome-Stake Production Co., 947 F. 2d 897, 898\u2013899 (CA10\n1991), vacated on other grounds, 503 U. S. 978 (1992).\nOthers, however, cannot be so construed. Two were not\ninterpreting \u00a778i(e) at all, but looked directly to \u00a777m,\ndespite Lampf\u2019s explicit selection of \u00a778i(e)\u2019s terms. Great\nRivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland\nIndustries, Inc., 120 F. 3d 893, 896 (CA8 1997); Topalian\nv. Ehrman, 954 F. 2d 1125, 1135 (CA5 1992). Another\ncourt candidly acknowledged that \u00a778i(e)\u2019s text\u2014unlike\n\u00a777m\u2019s\u2014forecloses constructive discovery, but it nonethe\nless held that courts remain \u201cfree to apply to [\u00a778i(e)] the\njudge-made doctrine of inquiry notice\u201d as a \u201cmodest and\ntraditional . . . exercise of judicial creativity,\u201d since \u201cCon\ngress could not have known when it enacted [\u00a778i(e)] that\nthis section would someday provide the statute of limita\ntions for a wide range of securities frauds.\u201d Tregenza v.\nGreat American Communications Co., 12 F. 3d 717, 721\u2013\n722 (CA7 1993) (Posner, J.).\n   The rest of the Circuits apparently had not decided the\nissue before \u00a71658(b)(1)\u2019s enactment. See Betz v. Trainer\nWortham & Co., 519 F. 3d 863, 874 (CA9 2008); New\nEngland Health Care Employees Pension Fund v. Ernst &\nYoung, LLP, 336 F. 3d 495, 500\u2013501, and n. 3 (CA6 2003);\nIn re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation, 306 F. 3d 1314,\n1325 (CA3 2002); see also Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito\nAguada v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., 129 F. 3d 222, 224 (CA1\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\n1997) (applying pre-Lampf rule under 15 U. S. C. \u00a778aa\u2013\n1). And of those that were undecided, two had cast doubt\non a constructive-discovery view in dicta\u2014of which the\nomniscient Congress of the Court\u2019s imagining should also\nhave been aware. See Berry v. Valence Technology, Inc.,\n175 F. 3d 699, 703\u2013705 (CA9 1999); Gruber v. Price Water\nhouse, 911 F. 2d 960, 964, n. 4 (CA3 1990).\n   This motley assortment of approaches comes nowhere\nnear establishing that the word \u201cdiscovery\u201d in \u00a778i(e)\nmeant constructive rather than actual discovery despite\n\u00a777m. Absent any textual or contextual reason to read\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d differently in \u00a71658(b)(1) and \u00a777m, I would\nhold that only actual discovery suffices to start the limita\ntions period for \u00a710(b) claims. Since Merck points to no\nevidence showing respondents actually discovered scienter\nmore than two years before bringing this suit, I agree with\nthe Court that the suit was not time barred.\n   Respondents suggested at oral argument, Tr. of Oral\nArg. 29, and their amici imply, see Faculty Brief 33\u201334,\nthat in fraud-on-the-market cases there is little if any\ndifference between actual and constructive discovery\nbecause of the presumption of reliance applicable in such\ncases, see Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 247 (1988).\nIt seems to me Basic has no bearing on the question dis\ncussed here. A presumption of reliance upon market-price\nsignals is not a presumption of knowledge of all public\ninformation, much less knowledge of nonpublic informa\ntion that a reasonably diligent investor would have inde\npendently uncovered. In any event, whether or not a\nconstructive-discovery standard will in many cases yield\nthe same result, actual discovery is what \u00a71658(b)(1)\nrequires to start the limitations period.\n</pre>",
