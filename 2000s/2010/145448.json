CASTANEDA, AS PERSONAL REPRESENTA-\n\n     TIVE OF THE ESTATE OF CASTANEDA, ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u20131529. Argued March 2, 2010\u2014Decided May 3, 2010\nWhile detained by immigration authorities, Francisco Castaneda per\n sistently sought treatment for a bleeding, suppurating lesion. Al\n though a U. S. Public Health Service (PHS) physician\u2019s assistant and\n three outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda urgently\n needed a biopsy, petitioners\u2014a PHS physician and a commissioned\n PHS officer\u2014denied the request. After Castaneda was released from\n custody, tests confirmed that he had metastatic cancer. He then filed\n this suit, raising medical negligence claims against the United States\n under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346, 2671\u2013\n 2680, and constitutional claims against petitioners under Bivens v.\n Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397. When Cas\n taneda died, respondents, his representative and heir, were substi\n tuted as plaintiffs. The District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to\n dismiss the Bivens action, rejecting their claim of absolute immunity\n under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7233(a), which provides: \u201cThe [FTCA] remedy\n against the United States provided by [28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b) and\n 2672] for damage for personal injury, including death, resulting from\n the performance of medical . . . or related functions . . . by any [PHS]\n commissioned officer or employee . . . while acting within the scope of\n his office or employment, shall be exclusive of any other civil action or\n proceeding by reason of the same subject-matter against the officer or\n employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The immunity provided by \u00a7233(a) precludes Bivens actions\n against individual PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of\n constitutional violations committed while acting within the scope of\n their office or employment. Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (a) The Court\u2019s inquiry begins and ends with \u00a7233(a)\u2019s text, which\n2                          HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    plainly precludes a Bivens action against petitioners by limiting re\n    covery for harms arising from the conduct at issue to an FTCA action\n    against the United States. The breadth of \u00a7233(a)\u2019s words \u201cexclusive\u201d\n    and \u201cany\u201d supports this reading, as does the provision\u2019s inclusive ref\n    erence to all civil proceedings arising out of \u201cthe same subject\n    matter.\u201d Because the phrase \u201cexclusive of any other civil action\u201d is\n    easily broad enough to accommodate both known and unknown\n    causes of action, the Court\u2019s reading is not undermined by the fact\n    that \u00a7233(a) preceded Bivens. The later enacted Westfall Act further\n    supports this understanding of \u00a7233(a). In amending the FTCA to\n    make its remedy against the United States exclusive for most claims\n    against Government employees for their official conduct, the Westfall\n    Act essentially duplicated \u00a7233(a)\u2019s exclusivity language, 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7 2679(b)(1), but provided an explicit exception for constitutional vio\n    lations, \u00a72679(b)(2). This shows that Congress did not understand\n    the exclusivity provided by \u00a72679(b)(1)\u2014or the substantially similar\n    \u00a7233(a)\u2014to imply such an exception. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Respondents\u2019 arguments to the contrary do not undermine the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 7\u201312.\n         (1) Respondents\u2019 heavy reliance on Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S.\n    14, is misplaced. Carlson is inapposite to the issue in this case\u2014\n    whether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations\u2014\n    because the Carlson petitioners invoked no official immunity. In\n    stead, the case considered the separate question whether a remedy\n    was available under the Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of\n    the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a\n    federal remedy was also available under the FTCA. Pp. 7\u20138.\n         (2) Contrary to respondents\u2019 contention, \u00a7233(a) does not incorpo\n    rate a Bivens exception through its cross-reference to \u00a71346(b) and\n    that section\u2019s cross-reference to the FTCA, which includes the\n    Westfall Act exception for constitutional claims, \u00a72679(b)(2)(A). Be\n    cause \u00a7233(a) refers only to \u201c[t]he remedy . . . provided by sections\n    1346(b) and 2672\u201d (emphasis added), only those portions of the FTCA\n    that establish its remedy are incorporated by \u00a7233(a)\u2019s reference to\n    \u00a71346. Section 2679(b) is not such a provision. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (3) Respondents\u2019 claim that the Westfall Act\u2019s Bivens exception,\n    \u00a72679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens action against PHS offi\n    cers and employees is belied by the fact that the provision by its\n    terms applies only to the specific immunity set forth in \u201c[p]aragraph\n    (1).\u201d Moreover, if \u00a7233(a) forecloses a Bivens action against PHS per\n    sonnel, respondents\u2019 reading of \u00a72679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied\n    repeal of the more specific \u00a7233(a). Repeals by implication are not\n    favored and will not be presumed absent a clear and manifest legisla\n    tive intent to repeal. Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U. S.\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  ___, ___. Nothing suggests that Congress intended \u00a72679(b) to repeal\n  \u00a7233(a)\u2019s more comprehensive immunity. P. 10.\n       (4) Respondents\u2019 contention that other features of \u00a7233 show that\n  \u00a7233(a) does not make the FTCA remedy exclusive of all other actions\n  against PHS personnel is rejected. Neither \u00a7233(c) nor \u00a7233(f) indi\n  cates that an injured party may maintain a Bivens action against an\n  individual PHS officer or employee in these circumstances.

S. C.\n\u00a7233(a), as added, 84 Stat. 1870, precludes an action\nunder Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403\nU. S. 388 (1971), against U. S. Public Health Service\n(PHS) personnel for constitutional violations arising out of\ntheir official duties. When federal employees are sued for\ndamages for harms caused in the course of their employ\nment, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71346, 2671\u20132680, generally authorizes substitution of\nthe United States as the defendant. Section 233(a) makes\nthe FTCA remedy against the United States \u201cexclusive of\nany other civil action or proceeding\u201d for any personal\ninjury caused by a PHS officer or employee performing a\nmedical or related function \u201cwhile acting within the scope\nof his office or employment.\u201d Based on the plain language\nof \u00a7233(a), we conclude that PHS officers and employees\nare not personally subject to Bivens actions for harms\narising out of such conduct.\n2                       HUI v. CASTANEDA \n\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n   Francisco Castaneda was detained by U. S. Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the San Diego Correc\ntional Facility (SDCF) beginning in March 2006. Accord\ning to the complaint later filed in the District Court, when\nCastaneda arrived at SDCF he had on his penis an irregu\nlar, raised lesion that measured roughly two centimeters\nsquare.1 Castaneda promptly brought his condition to the\nattention of medical personnel working for the Division of\nImmigration Health Services, reporting that the lesion\nwas growing in size and becoming more painful and that it\nfrequently bled and emitted a discharge. Petitioner Dr.\nEsther Hui, a civilian PHS employee, was the physician\nresponsible for Castaneda\u2019s medical care during his deten\ntion at SDCF. Petitioner Commander Stephen Gonsalves,\na commissioned PHS officer, was a Health Services Ad\nministrator at SDCF during the relevant period.\n   Between March 2006 and January 2007, Castaneda\npersistently sought treatment for his condition. As his\ndisease progressed, the lesion became increasingly painful\nand interfered with his urination, defecation, and sleep.\nIn December 2006, Castaneda additionally reported a\nlump in his groin. A PHS physician\u2019s assistant and three\noutside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda\nneeded a biopsy to ascertain whether he had cancer.\nPetitioners denied requests for a biopsy and other recom\nmended procedures as \u201celective.\u201d App. 244, 249\u2013251.\nInstead, Castaneda was treated with ibuprofen and anti\nbiotics and was given an additional ration of boxer shorts.\n   After a fourth specialist recommended a biopsy in Janu\nary 2007, the procedure was finally authorized. Instead of\nproviding treatment, however, ICE released Castaneda\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because this case comes to us on petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss, we\n\nassume the truth of respondents\u2019 factual allegations. See Fitzgerald v.\nBarnstable School Comm., 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1).\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom custody on February 5. A week later, biopsy results\nconfirmed that Castaneda was suffering from penile can\ncer. The next day, Castaneda had his penis amputated,\nand he began chemotherapy after tests confirmed that the\ncancer had metastasized to his groin. The treatment was\nunsuccessful, and Castaneda died in February 2008.\n   Three months before his death, Castaneda filed suit\nagainst petitioners in the United States District Court for\nthe Central District of California. As relevant, Castaneda\nraised medical negligence claims against the United\nStates under the FTCA and Bivens claims against peti\ntioners for deliberate indifference to his serious medical\nneeds in violation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights.2 After Castaneda\u2019s death, respon\ndents\u2014Castaneda\u2019s sister, Yanira Castaneda, and his\ndaughter, Vanessa Castaneda (by and through her\nmother, Lucia Pelayo)\u2014amended the complaint to substi\ntute themselves as plaintiffs. Yanira and Vanessa Casta\nneda are respectively the representative of and heir to\nCastaneda\u2019s estate.\n   Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them,\ncontending that \u00a7233(a) gives them absolute immunity\nfrom Bivens actions by making a suit against the United\nStates under the FTCA the exclusive remedy for harms\ncaused by PHS personnel in the course of their medical or\nrelated duties. The District Court denied the motion,\nconcluding that \u00a7233(a)\u2019s text and history evidence a\ncongressional intent to preserve Bivens actions. Casta\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 InBivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397\n(1971), this Court recognized an implied cause of action for damages\nagainst federal officers alleged to have violated the petitioner\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment rights. We subsequently found such a remedy available\nfor violations of an individual\u2019s rights under the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process\nClause. See Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14, 17\u201319 (1980); Davis v.\nPassman, 442 U. S. 228, 230 (1979).\n4                        HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nneda v. United States, 538 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1288\u20131295\n(2008). Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal.3\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment that \u00a7233(a) does not preclude\nrespondents\u2019 Bivens claims. Castaneda v. United States,\n546 F. 3d 682 (2008).4 The court cited Carlson v. Green,\n446 U. S. 14 (1980), for the proposition that a Bivens\nremedy is unavailable only when an alternative remedy is\nboth expressly declared to be a substitute and can be\nviewed as equally effective, or when special factors mili\ntate against direct recovery. Looking to the statute\u2019s text\nand history, the court noted that \u00a7233(a) does not mention\nthe Constitution or recovery thereunder and found it\nsignificant that \u00a7233 was enacted prior to this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Bivens. Drawing further support for its view\nfrom the statute\u2019s legislative history and from subsequent\ncongressional enactments, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat \u00a7233(a) does not expressly make the remedy under\nthe FTCA a substitute for relief under Bivens.\n  For essentially the reasons given in Carlson, 446 U. S.,\nat 20\u201323, the Court of Appeals also determined that the\nFTCA remedy is not equally effective as a Bivens remedy.\nUnlike the remedy under the FTCA, the court reasoned, a\nBivens remedy is awarded against individual defendants\nand may include punitive damages. Additionally, Bivens\ncases may be tried before a jury, and liability is governed\nby uniform federal rules rather than the law of the State\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Although it does not bear directly on the question presented in this\n\ncase, we note that while petitioners\u2019 appeal was pending the Govern\nment filed a formal notice admitting liability with respect to respon\ndents\u2019 claims for medical negligence under the FTCA. App. 329.\n  4 The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the interlocutory\n\nappeal because district court orders denying absolute immunity consti\ntute \u201cfinal decisions\u201d for purposes of 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291. See 546 F. 3d,\nat 687 (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524\u2013527 (1985)); see\nalso Osborn v. Haley, 549 U.

After further concluding\nthat no special factors militate against finding a remedy\navailable in these circumstances, the court held that\nrespondents\u2019 Bivens action could proceed.\n  As the Ninth Circuit recognized, its holding conflicts\nwith the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Cuoco v. Moritsugu,\n222 F. 3d 99 (2000), which construed \u00a7233(a) to foreclose\nBivens actions against PHS personnel. We granted certio\nrari to resolve this conflict. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  Our inquiry in this case begins and ends with the text of\n\u00a7233(a). See Harris Trust and Sav. Bank v. Salomon\nSmith Barney Inc., 530 U. S. 238, 254 (2000). The statute\nprovides in pertinent part that:\n    \u201c[t]he remedy against the United States provided by\n    sections 1346(b) and 2672 of title 28 . . . for damage\n    for personal injury, including death, resulting from\n    the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or re\n    lated functions, including the conduct of clinical stud\n    ies or investigation, by any commissioned officer or\n    employee of the Public Health Service while acting\n    within the scope of his office or employment, shall be\n    exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by rea\n    son of the same subject-matter against the officer or\n    employee (or his estate) whose act or omission gave\n    rise to the claim.\u201d \u00a7233(a) (emphasis added).\nSection 233(a) grants absolute immunity to PHS officers\nand employees for actions arising out of the performance\nof medical or related functions within the scope of their\nemployment by barring all actions against them for such\nconduct. By its terms, \u00a7233(a) limits recovery for such\nconduct to suits against the United States. The breadth of\nthe words \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cany\u201d supports this reading, as\n6                       HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndoes the provision\u2019s inclusive reference to all civil proceed\nings arising out of \u201cthe same subject-matter.\u201d We have\npreviously cited \u00a7233(a) to support the contention that\n\u201cCongress follows the practice of explicitly stating when it\nmeans to make FTCA an exclusive remedy.\u201d Carlson, 446\nU. S., at 20. The meaning of \u00a7233(a) has become no less\nexplicit since we last made that observation.\n   Our reading of \u00a7233(a)\u2019s text is not undermined by the\nfact that the provision preceded our decision in Bivens.\nContrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, that a Bivens\nremedy had not yet been recognized when \u00a7233(a) was\nenacted does not support the conclusion that Congress, in\nmaking the remedy provided by the FTCA \u201cexclusive of\nany other civil action,\u201d did not mean what it said. Lan\nguage that broad easily accommodates both known and\nunknown causes of action.\n   The later enacted Federal Employees Liability Reform\nand Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act), 102\nStat. 4563, further supports this understanding of \u00a7233(a).\nThe Westfall Act amended the FTCA to make its remedy\nagainst the United States the exclusive remedy for most\nclaims against Government employees arising out of their\nofficial conduct.5 In providing this official immunity,\nCongress used essentially the same language as it did in\n\u00a7233(a), stating that the remedy against the United States\nis \u201cexclusive of any other civil action or proceeding,\u201d\n\u00a72679(b)(1). Notably, Congress also provided an exception\nfor constitutional violations. Pursuant to \u00a72679(b)(2), the\nimmunity granted by \u00a72679(b)(1) \u201cdoes not extend or apply\nto a civil action against an employee of the Government\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Prior to the Westfall Act amendments, the FTCA authorized substi\n\ntution of the United States as a defendant in suits against federal\nemployees for harms arising out of conduct undertaken in the scope of\ntheir employment, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b) (1982 ed.), but it made that\nremedy \u201cexclusive\u201d only for harms resulting from a federal employee\u2019s\noperation of a motor vehicle, \u00a72679(b).\n                  Cite as: 559 U.

The Westfall Act\u2019s explicit\nexception for Bivens claims is powerful evidence that\nCongress did not understand the exclusivity provided by\n\u00a72679(b)(1)\u2014or the substantially similar \u00a7233(a)\u2014to\nimply such an exception. Given Congress\u2019 awareness of\npre-existing immunity provisions like \u00a7233 when it en\nacted the Westfall Act, see United States v. Smith, 499\nU. S. 160, 173 (1991), it is telling that Congress declined to\nenact a similar exception to the immunity provided by\n\u00a7233(a).\n                             B\n   In advocating a contrary reading of \u00a7233(a), respondents\nrely heavily on our opinion in Carlson, as did the Court of\nAppeals. Carlson, however, is inapposite to the issue in\nthis case. There are two separate inquiries involved in\ndetermining whether a Bivens action may proceed against\na federal agent: whether the agent is amenable to suit,\nand whether a damages remedy is available for a particu\nlar constitutional violation absent authorization by Con\ngress. See United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 684\n(1987) (\u201c[T]he availability of a damages action under the\nConstitution for particular injuries . . . is a question logi\ncally distinct from immunity to such an action on the part\nof particular defendants\u201d). Even in circumstances in\nwhich a Bivens remedy is generally available, an action\nunder Bivens will be defeated if the defendant is immune\nfrom suit. See, e.g., 403 U. S., at 397\u2013398 (remanding for\ndetermination of respondents\u2019 immunity after implying a\ncause of action under the Fourth Amendment).\n   Because petitioners in Carlson invoked no official im\nmunity, the Court did not address that question. Instead,\nit considered whether a remedy was available under the\nEighth Amendment for alleged violations of the Cruel and\nUnusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a\n8                          HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal remedy was also available under the FTCA. 446\nU. S., at 16\u201317. Many of our subsequent Bivens decisions\nlikewise addressed only the existence of an implied cause\nof action for an alleged constitutional violation. See, e.g.,\nWilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, 549 (2007) (declining \u201cto\ndevise a new Bivens damages action for retaliating against\nthe exercise of ownership rights\u201d); Bush v. Lucas, 462\nU. S. 367, 368 (1983) (declining to \u201cauthorize a new non\nstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose\nFirst Amendment rights are violated by their superiors\u201d).\n   This case presents the separate question whether peti\ntioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations.\nTo determine a defendant\u2019s amenability to suit, we con\nsider whether he or she may claim the benefits of official\nimmunity for the alleged misconduct. Because petitioners\ninvoke only the immunity provided by \u00a7233(a), the ques\ntion in this case is answered solely by reference to whether\nthat provision gives petitioners the immunity they claim.6\n   As noted, the text of \u00a7233(a) plainly indicates that it\nprecludes a Bivens action against petitioners for the harm\nalleged in this case. Respondents offer three arguments in\nsupport of their claim that it does not. None persuades us\nthat \u00a7233(a) means something other than what it says.\n   Respondents first contend that \u00a7233(a) incorporates the\nentirety of the FTCA, as amended by the Westfall Act,\nthrough its reference to \u00a71346(b).7 Section 1346(b) in turn\nrefers to \u201cthe provisions of chapter 171,\u201d which constitute\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We express no opinion as to whether a Bivens remedy is otherwise\n\navailable in these circumstances, as the question is not presented in\nthis case.\n   7 Section 1346(b) provides in pertinent part that, \u201c[s]ubject to the\n\nprovisions of chapter 171 of [Title 28], the district courts . . . shall have\nexclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United\nStates, for money damages . . . for injury or loss of property, or personal\ninjury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of\nany employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his\noffice or employment.\u201d\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe FTCA, including the Westfall Act\u2019s exception for\nclaims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution of the\nUnited States,\u201d \u00a72679(b)(2)(A). Through this series of\ncross-references, respondents would read that exception\nfor Bivens actions into \u00a7233(a).\n  Section 233(a) is not susceptible of this reading. As\npetitioners observe, that provision refers only to \u201c[t]he\nremedy against the United States provided by sections\n1346(b) and 2672.\u201d \u00a7233(a) (emphasis added). Thus, only\nthose portions of chapter 171 that establish the FTCA\nremedy are incorporated by \u00a7233(a)\u2019s reference to \u00a71346.\nSection 2679(b) is not such a provision. Section 233(a)\u2019s\nreference to \u00a726728\u2014which is codified in chapter 171\u2014also\nbelies respondents\u2019 theory.      If \u00a7233(a)\u2019s reference to\n\u00a71346(b) served to incorporate all the provisions of chapter\n171, the separate reference to \u00a72672 would be superfluous.\n  Respondents next argue that the Westfall Act\u2019s Bivens\nexception, \u00a72679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens\naction against PHS officers and employees.             That\n\u00a72679(b)(2)(A) by its terms applies only to the specific\nimmunity set forth in \u201c[p]aragraph (1)\u201d belies respondents\u2019\nclaim. Moreover, if \u00a7233(a) forecloses a Bivens action\nagainst PHS personnel, respondents\u2019 reading of\n\u00a72679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied repeal of that more\nspecific provision. Although we noted in Smith that\n\u00a72679(b) applies to all federal employees, see 499 U. S., at\n173, we had no occasion to consider whether the Bivens\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Section 2672 authorizes agency heads and their designees to \u201ccon\n\nsider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim\nfor money damages against the United States for injury or loss of\nproperty or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrong\nful act or omission of any employee of the agency while acting within\nthe scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the\nUnited States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in\naccordance with the law of the place where the act or omission oc\ncurred.\u201d\n10                       HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexception in \u00a72679(b)(2)(A) impliedly repealed pre-existing\nimmunity provisions to the extent of any inconsistency.\n\u201cAs we have emphasized, repeals by implication are not\nfavored and will not be presumed unless the intention of\nthe legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.\u201d Hawaii v.\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 10\u201311) (internal quotation marks and altera\ntion omitted). Respondents have pointed to nothing in\n\u00a72679(b)\u2019s text or drafting history that suggests that Con\ngress intended to repeal the more comprehensive immu\nnity provided by \u00a7233(a).\n   Finally, respondents contend that other features of \u00a7233\nshow that subsection (a) does not make the remedy under\nthe FTCA exclusive of all other actions against PHS per\nsonnel. Respondents first note \u00a7233\u2019s lack of a procedure\nfor \u201cscope certification\u201d in federal-court actions. Under the\nFTCA, \u201ccertification by the Attorney General that the\ndefendant employee was acting within the scope of his\noffice or employment at the time of the incident out of\nwhich the claim arose\u201d transforms an action against an\nindividual federal employee into one against the United\nStates. \u00a72679(d)(1). Because \u00a7233 does not provide a\nsimilar mechanism for scope certification in federal-court\nactions,9 respondents contend that PHS defendants seek\ning to invoke the immunity provided by \u00a7233(a) must rely\non the FTCA\u2019s scope certification procedure, set forth in\n\u00a72679(d). Section 2679(d), respondents note, is in turn\nsubject to the \u201climitations and exceptions\u201d applicable to\nactions under the FTCA\u2014including the exception for\nBivens actions provided by \u00a72679(b)(2). See \u00a72679(d)(4).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Section 233(c) includes such a provision for state-court actions, au\n\nthorizing removal to federal court \u201c[u]pon a certification by the Attor\nney General that the defendant was acting in the scope of his employ\nment at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose,\u201d but unlike\n\u00a72679(d) it does not prescribe a particular mechanism for substituting\nthe United States in federal-court actions.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We agree with petitioners that there is no reason to\nthink that scope certification by the Attorney General is a\nprerequisite to immunity under \u00a7233(a). To be sure, that\nimmunity is contingent upon the alleged misconduct\nhaving occurred in the course of the PHS defendant\u2019s\nduties, but a defendant may make that proof pursuant to\nthe ordinary rules of evidence and procedure. As petition\ners observe, proof of scope is in most \u00a7233(a) cases estab\nlished by a declaration affirming that the defendant was a\nPHS official during the relevant time period. See Reply\nBrief for Petitioner Hui 6\u20137, and n. 1. Thus, while scope\ncertification may provide a convenient mechanism for\nestablishing that the alleged misconduct occurred within\nthe scope of the employee\u2019s duties, the procedure author\nized by \u00a72679(d) is not necessary to effect substitution of\nthe United States. Finally, that the FTCA\u2019s scope certifi\ncation procedure was enacted almost two decades after\n\u00a7233(a) confirms that Congress did not intend to make\nthat procedure the exclusive means for PHS personnel to\ninvoke the official immunity provided by \u00a7233(a).\n   Respondents\u2019 argument based on \u00a7233(f) is similarly\nunavailing. That subsection authorizes the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services to \u201chold harmless or provide\nliability insurance\u201d for a PHS officer or employee for per\nsonal injuries caused by conduct occurring \u201cwithin the\nscope of his office or employment . . . if such employee is\nassigned to a foreign country . . . and if the circumstances\nare such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third\npersons against the United States described in section\n2679(b).\u201d    Noting that the FTCA precludes recovery\nagainst the United States for \u201c[a]ny claim arising in a\nforeign country,\u201d \u00a72680(k), respondents urge that \u00a7233(f)\u2019s\nauthorization of insurance or indemnification in those\ncircumstances anticipates that an injured party without a\n12                       HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nremedy under the FTCA may sue a PHS official directly.10\nAccordingly, respondents contend, \u00a7233(a) cannot be read\nto make the remedy under the FTCA truly exclusive.\nEven if that reading of \u00a7233(f) were correct, it would not\nbenefit respondents because an FTCA remedy is unques\ntionably available for the misconduct alleged in this case.\n   For the foregoing reasons, respondents\u2019 arguments do\nnot undermine our conclusion that the immunity provided\nby \u00a7233(a) precludes Bivens actions against individual\nPHS officers or employees for harms arising out of conduct\ndescribed in that section.\n                         *    *      *\n  In construing \u00a7233(a) in petitioners\u2019 favor, we are mind\nful of the confines of our judicial role. Respondents\u2019 amici\ncaution that providing special immunity for PHS person\nnel is contrary to the public interest.11 Respondents like\nwise contend that allowing Bivens claims against PHS\npersonnel is necessary to ensure an adequate standard of\ncare in federal detention facilities, and they further urge\nthat permitting such actions would not endanger PHS\u2019\ninstitutional interests as it would simply place PHS per\nsonnel in the same position as other federal employees\nwho perform similar functions. See Brief for Respondents\n52\u201355, 60\u201361. We are required, however, to read the\nstatute according to its text.

See Brief for Respondents 32 (citing United States v.\nSmith, 499 U. S. 160, 166\u2013167 (1991)). But because the Act does not\nweaken any inference about the meaning of \u00a7233(a) that might be\ndrawn from \u00a7233(f), the changes effected by the Act are not relevant to\nthe instant inquiry.\n   11 See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 25\u2013\n\n28; Brief for National Experts on Health Services for Detained Persons\nas Amici Curiae 17\u201324; Brief for National Immigrant Justice Center as\nAmicus Curiae 20\u201321; Brief for Rep.

Argued March 2, 2010\u2014Decided May 3, 2010\nWhile detained by immigration authorities, Francisco Castaneda per\n sistently sought treatment for a bleeding, suppurating lesion. Al\n though a U. S. Public Health Service (PHS) physician\u2019s assistant and\n three outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda urgently\n needed a biopsy, petitioners\u2014a PHS physician and a commissioned\n PHS officer\u2014denied the request. After Castaneda was released from\n custody, tests confirmed that he had metastatic cancer. He then filed\n this suit, raising medical negligence claims against the United States\n under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346, 2671\u2013\n 2680, and constitutional claims against petitioners under Bivens v.\n Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397. When Cas\n taneda died, respondents, his representative and heir, were substi\n tuted as plaintiffs. The District Court denied petitioners\u2019 motion to\n dismiss the Bivens action, rejecting their claim of absolute immunity\n under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7233(a), which provides: \u201cThe [FTCA] remedy\n against the United States provided by [28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b) and\n 2672] for damage for personal injury, including death, resulting from\n the performance of medical . . . or related functions . . . by any [PHS]\n commissioned officer or employee . . . while acting within the scope of\n his office or employment, shall be exclusive of any other civil action or\n proceeding by reason of the same subject-matter against the officer or\n employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The immunity provided by \u00a7233(a) precludes Bivens actions\n against individual PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of\n constitutional violations committed while acting within the scope of\n their office or employment. Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (a) The Court\u2019s inquiry begins and ends with \u00a7233(a)\u2019s text, which\n2                          HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    plainly precludes a Bivens action against petitioners by limiting re\n    covery for harms arising from the conduct at issue to an FTCA action\n    against the United States. The breadth of \u00a7233(a)\u2019s words \u201cexclusive\u201d\n    and \u201cany\u201d supports this reading, as does the provision\u2019s inclusive ref\n    erence to all civil proceedings arising out of \u201cthe same subject\n    matter.\u201d Because the phrase \u201cexclusive of any other civil action\u201d is\n    easily broad enough to accommodate both known and unknown\n    causes of action, the Court\u2019s reading is not undermined by the fact\n    that \u00a7233(a) preceded Bivens. The later enacted Westfall Act further\n    supports this understanding of \u00a7233(a). In amending the FTCA to\n    make its remedy against the United States exclusive for most claims\n    against Government employees for their official conduct, the Westfall\n    Act essentially duplicated \u00a7233(a)\u2019s exclusivity language, 28 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7 2679(b)(1), but provided an explicit exception for constitutional vio\n    lations, \u00a72679(b)(2). This shows that Congress did not understand\n    the exclusivity provided by \u00a72679(b)(1)\u2014or the substantially similar\n    \u00a7233(a)\u2014to imply such an exception. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Respondents\u2019 arguments to the contrary do not undermine the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion. Pp. 7\u201312.\n         (1) Respondents\u2019 heavy reliance on Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S.\n    14, is misplaced. Carlson is inapposite to the issue in this case\u2014\n    whether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations\u2014\n    because the Carlson petitioners invoked no official immunity. In\n    stead, the case considered the separate question whether a remedy\n    was available under the Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of\n    the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a\n    federal remedy was also available under the FTCA. Pp. 7\u20138.\n         (2) Contrary to respondents\u2019 contention, \u00a7233(a) does not incorpo\n    rate a Bivens exception through its cross-reference to \u00a71346(b) and\n    that section\u2019s cross-reference to the FTCA, which includes the\n    Westfall Act exception for constitutional claims, \u00a72679(b)(2)(A). Be\n    cause \u00a7233(a) refers only to \u201c[t]he remedy . . . provided by sections\n    1346(b) and 2672\u201d (emphasis added), only those portions of the FTCA\n    that establish its remedy are incorporated by \u00a7233(a)\u2019s reference to\n    \u00a71346. Section 2679(b) is not such a provision. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (3) Respondents\u2019 claim that the Westfall Act\u2019s Bivens exception,\n    \u00a72679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens action against PHS offi\n    cers and employees is belied by the fact that the provision by its\n    terms applies only to the specific immunity set forth in \u201c[p]aragraph\n    (1).\u201d Moreover, if \u00a7233(a) forecloses a Bivens action against PHS per\n    sonnel, respondents\u2019 reading of \u00a72679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied\n    repeal of the more specific \u00a7233(a).

S. C.\n\u00a7233(a), as added, 84 Stat. 1870, precludes an action\nunder Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403\nU. S. 388 (1971), against U. S. Public Health Service\n(PHS) personnel for constitutional violations arising out of\ntheir official duties. When federal employees are sued for\ndamages for harms caused in the course of their employ\nment, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71346, 2671\u20132680, generally authorizes substitution of\nthe United States as the defendant. Section 233(a) makes\nthe FTCA remedy against the United States \u201cexclusive of\nany other civil action or proceeding\u201d for any personal\ninjury caused by a PHS officer or employee performing a\nmedical or related function \u201cwhile acting within the scope\nof his office or employment.\u201d Based on the plain language\nof \u00a7233(a), we conclude that PHS officers and employees\nare not personally subject to Bivens actions for harms\narising out of such conduct.\n2                       HUI v. CASTANEDA \n\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               I\n\n   Francisco Castaneda was detained by U. S. Immigration\nand Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the San Diego Correc\ntional Facility (SDCF) beginning in March 2006. Accord\ning to the complaint later filed in the District Court, when\nCastaneda arrived at SDCF he had on his penis an irregu\nlar, raised lesion that measured roughly two centimeters\nsquare.1 Castaneda promptly brought his condition to the\nattention of medical personnel working for the Division of\nImmigration Health Services, reporting that the lesion\nwas growing in size and becoming more painful and that it\nfrequently bled and emitted a discharge. Petitioner Dr.\nEsther Hui, a civilian PHS employee, was the physician\nresponsible for Castaneda\u2019s medical care during his deten\ntion at SDCF. Petitioner Commander Stephen Gonsalves,\na commissioned PHS officer, was a Health Services Ad\nministrator at SDCF during the relevant period.\n   Between March 2006 and January 2007, Castaneda\npersistently sought treatment for his condition. As his\ndisease progressed, the lesion became increasingly painful\nand interfered with his urination, defecation, and sleep.\nIn December 2006, Castaneda additionally reported a\nlump in his groin. A PHS physician\u2019s assistant and three\noutside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda\nneeded a biopsy to ascertain whether he had cancer.\nPetitioners denied requests for a biopsy and other recom\nmended procedures as \u201celective.\u201d App. 244, 249\u2013251.\nInstead, Castaneda was treated with ibuprofen and anti\nbiotics and was given an additional ration of boxer shorts.\n   After a fourth specialist recommended a biopsy in Janu\nary 2007, the procedure was finally authorized. Instead of\nproviding treatment, however, ICE released Castaneda\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because this case comes to us on petitioners\u2019 motion to dismiss, we\n\nassume the truth of respondents\u2019 factual allegations.

S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom custody on February 5. A week later, biopsy results\nconfirmed that Castaneda was suffering from penile can\ncer. The next day, Castaneda had his penis amputated,\nand he began chemotherapy after tests confirmed that the\ncancer had metastasized to his groin. The treatment was\nunsuccessful, and Castaneda died in February 2008.\n   Three months before his death, Castaneda filed suit\nagainst petitioners in the United States District Court for\nthe Central District of California. As relevant, Castaneda\nraised medical negligence claims against the United\nStates under the FTCA and Bivens claims against peti\ntioners for deliberate indifference to his serious medical\nneeds in violation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights.2 After Castaneda\u2019s death, respon\ndents\u2014Castaneda\u2019s sister, Yanira Castaneda, and his\ndaughter, Vanessa Castaneda (by and through her\nmother, Lucia Pelayo)\u2014amended the complaint to substi\ntute themselves as plaintiffs. Yanira and Vanessa Casta\nneda are respectively the representative of and heir to\nCastaneda\u2019s estate.\n   Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them,\ncontending that \u00a7233(a) gives them absolute immunity\nfrom Bivens actions by making a suit against the United\nStates under the FTCA the exclusive remedy for harms\ncaused by PHS personnel in the course of their medical or\nrelated duties. The District Court denied the motion,\nconcluding that \u00a7233(a)\u2019s text and history evidence a\ncongressional intent to preserve Bivens actions.

S. 388, 397\n(1971), this Court recognized an implied cause of action for damages\nagainst federal officers alleged to have violated the petitioner\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment rights. We subsequently found such a remedy available\nfor violations of an individual\u2019s rights under the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process\nClause.

CASTANEDA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nneda v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2295931\"><a href=\"/opinion/2295931/castaneda-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1288\u20131295\n(2008). Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal.3\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment that \u00a7233(a) does not preclude\nrespondents\u2019 Bivens claims. Castaneda v. United States,\n546 F. 3d 682 (2008).4 The court cited Carlson v. Green,\n446 U. S. 14 (1980), for the proposition that a Bivens\nremedy is unavailable only when an alternative remedy is\nboth expressly declared to be a substitute and can be\nviewed as equally effective, or when special factors mili\ntate against direct recovery. Looking to the statute\u2019s text\nand history, the court noted that \u00a7233(a) does not mention\nthe Constitution or recovery thereunder and found it\nsignificant that \u00a7233 was enacted prior to this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Bivens. Drawing further support for its view\nfrom the statute\u2019s legislative history and from subsequent\ncongressional enactments, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat \u00a7233(a) does not expressly make the remedy under\nthe FTCA a substitute for relief under Bivens.\n  For essentially the reasons given in Carlson, 446 U. S.,\nat 20\u201323, the Court of Appeals also determined that the\nFTCA remedy is not equally effective as a Bivens remedy.\nUnlike the remedy under the FTCA, the court reasoned, a\nBivens remedy is awarded against individual defendants\nand may include punitive damages. Additionally, Bivens\ncases may be tried before a jury, and liability is governed\nby uniform federal rules rather than the law of the State\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Although it does not bear directly on the question presented in this\n\ncase, we note that while petitioners\u2019 appeal was pending the Govern\nment filed a formal notice admitting liability with respect to respon\ndents\u2019 claims for medical negligence under the FTCA. App. 329.\n  4 The court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the interlocutory\n\nappeal because district court orders denying absolute immunity consti\ntute \u201cfinal decisions\u201d for purposes of 28 U. S. C. \u00a71291. See 546 F. 3d,\nat 687 (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524\u2013527 (1985)); see\nalso Osborn v. Haley, 549 U. S. 225, 238\u2013239 (2007).\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin which the violation occurred. After further concluding\nthat no special factors militate against finding a remedy\navailable in these circumstances, the court held that\nrespondents\u2019 Bivens action could proceed.\n  As the Ninth Circuit recognized, its holding conflicts\nwith the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in Cuoco v. Moritsugu,\n222 F. 3d 99 (2000), which construed \u00a7233(a) to foreclose\nBivens actions against PHS personnel. We granted certio\nrari to resolve this conflict. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  Our inquiry in this case begins and ends with the text of\n\u00a7233(a). See Harris Trust and Sav. Bank v. Salomon\nSmith Barney Inc., 530 U. S. 238, 254 (2000). The statute\nprovides in pertinent part that:\n    \u201c[t]he remedy against the United States provided by\n    sections 1346(b) and 2672 of title 28 . . . for damage\n    for personal injury, including death, resulting from\n    the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or re\n    lated functions, including the conduct of clinical stud\n    ies or investigation, by any commissioned officer or\n    employee of the Public Health Service while acting\n    within the scope of his office or employment, shall be\n    exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by rea\n    son of the same subject-matter against the officer or\n    employee (or his estate) whose act or omission gave\n    rise to the claim.\u201d \u00a7233(a) (emphasis added).\nSection 233(a) grants absolute immunity to PHS officers\nand employees for actions arising out of the performance\nof medical or related functions within the scope of their\nemployment by barring all actions against them for such\nconduct. By its terms, \u00a7233(a) limits recovery for such\nconduct to suits against the United States. The breadth of\nthe words \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cany\u201d supports this reading, as\n6                       HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndoes the provision\u2019s inclusive reference to all civil proceed\nings arising out of \u201cthe same subject-matter.\u201d We have\npreviously cited \u00a7233(a) to support the contention that\n\u201cCongress follows the practice of explicitly stating when it\nmeans to make FTCA an exclusive remedy.\u201d Carlson, 446\nU. S., at 20. The meaning of \u00a7233(a) has become no less\nexplicit since we last made that observation.\n   Our reading of \u00a7233(a)\u2019s text is not undermined by the\nfact that the provision preceded our decision in Bivens.\nContrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, that a Bivens\nremedy had not yet been recognized when \u00a7233(a) was\nenacted does not support the conclusion that Congress, in\nmaking the remedy provided by the FTCA \u201cexclusive of\nany other civil action,\u201d did not mean what it said. Lan\nguage that broad easily accommodates both known and\nunknown causes of action.\n   The later enacted Federal Employees Liability Reform\nand Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act), 102\nStat. 4563, further supports this understanding of \u00a7233(a).\nThe Westfall Act amended the FTCA to make its remedy\nagainst the United States the exclusive remedy for most\nclaims against Government employees arising out of their\nofficial conduct.5 In providing this official immunity,\nCongress used essentially the same language as it did in\n\u00a7233(a), stating that the remedy against the United States\nis \u201cexclusive of any other civil action or proceeding,\u201d\n\u00a72679(b)(1). Notably, Congress also provided an exception\nfor constitutional violations. Pursuant to \u00a72679(b)(2), the\nimmunity granted by \u00a72679(b)(1) \u201cdoes not extend or apply\nto a civil action against an employee of the Government\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Prior to the Westfall Act amendments, the FTCA authorized substi\n\ntution of the United States as a defendant in suits against federal\nemployees for harms arising out of conduct undertaken in the scope of\ntheir employment, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a71346(b) (1982 ed.), but it made that\nremedy \u201cexclusive\u201d only for harms resulting from a federal employee\u2019s\noperation of a motor vehicle, \u00a72679(b).\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n. . . brought for a violation of the Constitution of the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a72679(b)(2)(A). The Westfall Act\u2019s explicit\nexception for Bivens claims is powerful evidence that\nCongress did not understand the exclusivity provided by\n\u00a72679(b)(1)\u2014or the substantially similar \u00a7233(a)\u2014to\nimply such an exception. Given Congress\u2019 awareness of\npre-existing immunity provisions like \u00a7233 when it en\nacted the Westfall Act, see United States v. Smith, 499\nU. S. 160, 173 (1991), it is telling that Congress declined to\nenact a similar exception to the immunity provided by\n\u00a7233(a).\n                             B\n   In advocating a contrary reading of \u00a7233(a), respondents\nrely heavily on our opinion in Carlson, as did the Court of\nAppeals. Carlson, however, is inapposite to the issue in\nthis case. There are two separate inquiries involved in\ndetermining whether a Bivens action may proceed against\na federal agent: whether the agent is amenable to suit,\nand whether a damages remedy is available for a particu\nlar constitutional violation absent authorization by Con\ngress. See United States v. Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 684\n(1987) (\u201c[T]he availability of a damages action under the\nConstitution for particular injuries . . . is a question logi\ncally distinct from immunity to such an action on the part\nof particular defendants\u201d). Even in circumstances in\nwhich a Bivens remedy is generally available, an action\nunder Bivens will be defeated if the defendant is immune\nfrom suit. See, e.g., 403 U. S., at 397\u2013398 (remanding for\ndetermination of respondents\u2019 immunity after implying a\ncause of action under the Fourth Amendment).\n   Because petitioners in Carlson invoked no official im\nmunity, the Court did not address that question. Instead,\nit considered whether a remedy was available under the\nEighth Amendment for alleged violations of the Cruel and\nUnusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a\n8                          HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal remedy was also available under the FTCA. 446\nU. S., at 16\u201317. Many of our subsequent Bivens decisions\nlikewise addressed only the existence of an implied cause\nof action for an alleged constitutional violation. See, e.g.,\nWilkie v. Robbins, 551 U. S. 537, 549 (2007) (declining \u201cto\ndevise a new Bivens damages action for retaliating against\nthe exercise of ownership rights\u201d); Bush v. Lucas, 462\nU. S. 367, 368 (1983) (declining to \u201cauthorize a new non\nstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose\nFirst Amendment rights are violated by their superiors\u201d).\n   This case presents the separate question whether peti\ntioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations.\nTo determine a defendant\u2019s amenability to suit, we con\nsider whether he or she may claim the benefits of official\nimmunity for the alleged misconduct. Because petitioners\ninvoke only the immunity provided by \u00a7233(a), the ques\ntion in this case is answered solely by reference to whether\nthat provision gives petitioners the immunity they claim.6\n   As noted, the text of \u00a7233(a) plainly indicates that it\nprecludes a Bivens action against petitioners for the harm\nalleged in this case. Respondents offer three arguments in\nsupport of their claim that it does not. None persuades us\nthat \u00a7233(a) means something other than what it says.\n   Respondents first contend that \u00a7233(a) incorporates the\nentirety of the FTCA, as amended by the Westfall Act,\nthrough its reference to \u00a71346(b).7 Section 1346(b) in turn\nrefers to \u201cthe provisions of chapter 171,\u201d which constitute\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 We express no opinion as to whether a Bivens remedy is otherwise\n\navailable in these circumstances, as the question is not presented in\nthis case.\n   7 Section 1346(b) provides in pertinent part that, \u201c[s]ubject to the\n\nprovisions of chapter 171 of [Title 28], the district courts . . . shall have\nexclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United\nStates, for money damages . . . for injury or loss of property, or personal\ninjury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of\nany employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his\noffice or employment.\u201d\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe FTCA, including the Westfall Act\u2019s exception for\nclaims \u201cbrought for a violation of the Constitution of the\nUnited States,\u201d \u00a72679(b)(2)(A). Through this series of\ncross-references, respondents would read that exception\nfor Bivens actions into \u00a7233(a).\n  Section 233(a) is not susceptible of this reading. As\npetitioners observe, that provision refers only to \u201c[t]he\nremedy against the United States provided by sections\n1346(b) and 2672.\u201d \u00a7233(a) (emphasis added). Thus, only\nthose portions of chapter 171 that establish the FTCA\nremedy are incorporated by \u00a7233(a)\u2019s reference to \u00a71346.\nSection 2679(b) is not such a provision. Section 233(a)\u2019s\nreference to \u00a726728\u2014which is codified in chapter 171\u2014also\nbelies respondents\u2019 theory.      If \u00a7233(a)\u2019s reference to\n\u00a71346(b) served to incorporate all the provisions of chapter\n171, the separate reference to \u00a72672 would be superfluous.\n  Respondents next argue that the Westfall Act\u2019s Bivens\nexception, \u00a72679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a Bivens\naction against PHS officers and employees.             That\n\u00a72679(b)(2)(A) by its terms applies only to the specific\nimmunity set forth in \u201c[p]aragraph (1)\u201d belies respondents\u2019\nclaim. Moreover, if \u00a7233(a) forecloses a Bivens action\nagainst PHS personnel, respondents\u2019 reading of\n\u00a72679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied repeal of that more\nspecific provision. Although we noted in Smith that\n\u00a72679(b) applies to all federal employees, see 499 U. S., at\n173, we had no occasion to consider whether the Bivens\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Section 2672 authorizes agency heads and their designees to \u201ccon\n\nsider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim\nfor money damages against the United States for injury or loss of\nproperty or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrong\nful act or omission of any employee of the agency while acting within\nthe scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the\nUnited States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in\naccordance with the law of the place where the act or omission oc\ncurred.\u201d\n10                       HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexception in \u00a72679(b)(2)(A) impliedly repealed pre-existing\nimmunity provisions to the extent of any inconsistency.\n\u201cAs we have emphasized, repeals by implication are not\nfavored and will not be presumed unless the intention of\nthe legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.\u201d Hawaii v.\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 10\u201311) (internal quotation marks and altera\ntion omitted). Respondents have pointed to nothing in\n\u00a72679(b)\u2019s text or drafting history that suggests that Con\ngress intended to repeal the more comprehensive immu\nnity provided by \u00a7233(a).\n   Finally, respondents contend that other features of \u00a7233\nshow that subsection (a) does not make the remedy under\nthe FTCA exclusive of all other actions against PHS per\nsonnel. Respondents first note \u00a7233\u2019s lack of a procedure\nfor \u201cscope certification\u201d in federal-court actions. Under the\nFTCA, \u201ccertification by the Attorney General that the\ndefendant employee was acting within the scope of his\noffice or employment at the time of the incident out of\nwhich the claim arose\u201d transforms an action against an\nindividual federal employee into one against the United\nStates. \u00a72679(d)(1). Because \u00a7233 does not provide a\nsimilar mechanism for scope certification in federal-court\nactions,9 respondents contend that PHS defendants seek\ning to invoke the immunity provided by \u00a7233(a) must rely\non the FTCA\u2019s scope certification procedure, set forth in\n\u00a72679(d). Section 2679(d), respondents note, is in turn\nsubject to the \u201climitations and exceptions\u201d applicable to\nactions under the FTCA\u2014including the exception for\nBivens actions provided by \u00a72679(b)(2). See \u00a72679(d)(4).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Section 233(c) includes such a provision for state-court actions, au\n\nthorizing removal to federal court \u201c[u]pon a certification by the Attor\nney General that the defendant was acting in the scope of his employ\nment at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose,\u201d but unlike\n\u00a72679(d) it does not prescribe a particular mechanism for substituting\nthe United States in federal-court actions.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We agree with petitioners that there is no reason to\nthink that scope certification by the Attorney General is a\nprerequisite to immunity under \u00a7233(a). To be sure, that\nimmunity is contingent upon the alleged misconduct\nhaving occurred in the course of the PHS defendant\u2019s\nduties, but a defendant may make that proof pursuant to\nthe ordinary rules of evidence and procedure. As petition\ners observe, proof of scope is in most \u00a7233(a) cases estab\nlished by a declaration affirming that the defendant was a\nPHS official during the relevant time period.

Thus, while scope\ncertification may provide a convenient mechanism for\nestablishing that the alleged misconduct occurred within\nthe scope of the employee\u2019s duties, the procedure author\nized by \u00a72679(d) is not necessary to effect substitution of\nthe United States. Finally, that the FTCA\u2019s scope certifi\ncation procedure was enacted almost two decades after\n\u00a7233(a) confirms that Congress did not intend to make\nthat procedure the exclusive means for PHS personnel to\ninvoke the official immunity provided by \u00a7233(a).\n   Respondents\u2019 argument based on \u00a7233(f) is similarly\nunavailing. That subsection authorizes the Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services to \u201chold harmless or provide\nliability insurance\u201d for a PHS officer or employee for per\nsonal injuries caused by conduct occurring \u201cwithin the\nscope of his office or employment . . . if such employee is\nassigned to a foreign country . . . and if the circumstances\nare such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third\npersons against the United States described in section\n2679(b).\u201d    Noting that the FTCA precludes recovery\nagainst the United States for \u201c[a]ny claim arising in a\nforeign country,\u201d \u00a72680(k), respondents urge that \u00a7233(f)\u2019s\nauthorization of insurance or indemnification in those\ncircumstances anticipates that an injured party without a\n12                       HUI v. CASTANEDA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nremedy under the FTCA may sue a PHS official directly.10\nAccordingly, respondents contend, \u00a7233(a) cannot be read\nto make the remedy under the FTCA truly exclusive.\nEven if that reading of \u00a7233(f) were correct, it would not\nbenefit respondents because an FTCA remedy is unques\ntionably available for the misconduct alleged in this case.\n   For the foregoing reasons, respondents\u2019 arguments do\nnot undermine our conclusion that the immunity provided\nby \u00a7233(a) precludes Bivens actions against individual\nPHS officers or employees for harms arising out of conduct\ndescribed in that section.\n                         *    *      *\n  In construing \u00a7233(a) in petitioners\u2019 favor, we are mind\nful of the confines of our judicial role. Respondents\u2019 amici\ncaution that providing special immunity for PHS person\nnel is contrary to the public interest.11 Respondents like\nwise contend that allowing Bivens claims against PHS\npersonnel is necessary to ensure an adequate standard of\ncare in federal detention facilities, and they further urge\nthat permitting such actions would not endanger PHS\u2019\ninstitutional interests as it would simply place PHS per\nsonnel in the same position as other federal employees\nwho perform similar functions. See Brief for Respondents\n52\u201355, 60\u201361. We are required, however, to read the\nstatute according to its text. Because \u00a7233(a) plainly\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 As  respondents note, the Westfall Act substantially limited the\neffect of \u00a7233(f). See Brief for Respondents 32 (citing United States v.\nSmith, 499 U. S. 160, 166\u2013167 (1991)). But because the Act does not\nweaken any inference about the meaning of \u00a7233(a) that might be\ndrawn from \u00a7233(f), the changes effected by the Act are not relevant to\nthe instant inquiry.\n   11 See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 25\u2013\n\n28; Brief for National Experts on Health Services for Detained Persons\nas Amici Curiae 17\u201324; Brief for National Immigrant Justice Center as\nAmicus Curiae 20\u201321; Brief for Rep.
