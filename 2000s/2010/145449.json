LETT\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u2013338.      Argued March 29, 2010\u2014Decided May 3, 2010\nFrom jury selection to jury instructions in a Michigan court, respondent\n  Lett\u2019s first trial for, inter alia, first-degree murder took less than nine\n  hours. During approximately four hours of deliberations, the jury\n  sent the trial court seven notes, including one asking what would\n  happen if the jury could not agree. The judge called the jury and the\n  attorneys into the courtroom and questioned the foreperson, who said\n  that the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The judge\n  then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury, and scheduled a new\n  trial. At Lett\u2019s second trial, after deliberating for only 3 hours and 15\n  minutes, a new jury found him guilty of second-degree murder. On\n  appeal, Lett argued that because the judge in his first trial had an\n  nounced a mistrial without any manifest necessity to do so, the Dou\n  ble Jeopardy Clause barred the State from trying him a second time.\n  Agreeing, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.\n  The Michigan Supreme Court reversed. It concluded that, under\n  United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580, a defendant may be retried\n  following the discharge of a deadlocked jury so long as the trial court\n  exercised its \u201csound discretion\u201d in concluding that the jury was dead\n  locked and thus that there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial;\n  and that, under Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 506\u2013510, an\n  appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge\u2019s determination\n  that a deadlock has been reached. It then found that the judge at\n  Lett\u2019s first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mis\n  trial, observing that the jury had deliberated a sufficient amount of\n  time following a short, noncomplex trial; that the jury had sent sev\n  eral notes, including one appearing to indicate heated discussions;\n  and that the foreperson had stated that the jury could not reach a\n  verdict. In Lett\u2019s federal habeas petition, he contended that the\n2                           RENICO v. LETT\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of his double jeopardy claim was\n    \u201can unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law,\n    as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), and thus that he was not barred by the Antiter\n    rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) from ob\n    taining federal habeas relief. The District Court granted the writ,\n    and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case was\n not unreasonable under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting\n Lett habeas relief. Pp. 5\u201312.\n    (a) The question under AEDPA is whether the Michigan Supreme\n Court\u2019s determination was \u201can unreasonable application of . . . clearly\n established Federal law,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), not whether it was an incorrect\n application of that law, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410.\n AEDPA imposes a \u201chighly deferential standard for evaluating state\n court rulings,\u201d Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7, and \u201cde\n mands that [they] be given the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Woodford v. Vis\n ciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (per curiam). Pp. 5\u20136.\n    (b) Here, the \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d is largely undis\n puted. When a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury\n cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a\n new trial for the defendant before a new jury, Perez, 9 Wheat., at\n 579\u2013580. Trial judges may declare a mistrial when, \u201cin their opinion,\n taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest\n necessity\u201d for doing so, id., at 580, i.e., a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity,\n Washington, supra, at 506. The decision whether to grant a mistrial\n is reserved to the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of the trial judge, Illinois v.\n Somerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462, and the discretion \u201cto declare a mis\n trial [for a deadlocked jury] is . . . accorded great deference by a re\n viewing court,\u201d Washington, supra, at 510, although this deference is\n not absolute. This Court has expressly declined to require the \u201cme\n chanical application\u201d of any \u201crigid formula,\u201d Wade v. Hunter, 336\n U. S. 684, 690\u2013691, when a trial judge decides to declare a mistrial\n due to jury deadlock, and it has explicitly held that the judge is not\n required to make explicit findings of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d or \u201carticu\n late on the record all the factors\u201d informing his discretion, Washing\n ton, supra, at 517. The Court has never required a judge in these cir\n cumstances to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of\n time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with counsel, to\n issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to consider any other means\n of breaking the impasse. Moreover, the legal standard applied by the\n Michigan Supreme Court is a general one\u2014whether there was an\n abuse of the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d reserved to the trial judge, Somerville,\n supra, at 462. Because AEDPA authorizes a federal court to grant\n                     Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  relief only when a state court\u2019s application of federal law was unrea\n  sonable, it follows that \u201c[t]he more general the rule\u201d at issue\u2014and\n  thus the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement among fair\n  minded judges\u2014\u201cthe more leeway [state] courts have in reaching out\n  comes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541\n  U. S. 652, 664. Pp. 6\u20139.\n     (c) The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s adjudication involved a straight\n  forward application of this Court\u2019s longstanding precedents to the\n  facts of Lett\u2019s case. The state court cited this Court\u2019s double jeopardy\n  cases\u2014from Perez to Washington\u2014applying those precedents to the\n  particular facts before it and finding no abuse of discretion in light of\n  the length of deliberations following a short, uncomplicated trial, the\n  jury\u2019s notes to the judge, and the fact that the foreperson stated that\n  the jury could not reach a verdict. It was thus reasonable for the\n  court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion\n  in declaring a mistrial. The Sixth Circuit concluded otherwise be\n  cause it disagreed with the inferences that the Michigan Supreme\n  Court had drawn from the facts. The Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation is\n  not implausible, but other reasonable interpretations of the record\n  are also possible. It was not objectively unreasonable for the Michi\n  gan Supreme Court to conclude that the trial judge\u2019s exercise of dis\n  cretion was sound, both in light of what happened at trial and the\n  fact that the relevant legal standard is a general one, to which there\n  is no \u201cplainly correct or incorrect\u201d answer in this case. Yarborough,\n  supra, at 664. The Sixth Circuit failed to grant the Michigan courts\n  the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA and this Court\u2019s dou\n  ble jeopardy precedents. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (d) The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on its own Fulton v.\n  Moore decision for the proposition that Arizona v. Washington sets\n  forth three specific factors that determine whether a judge has exer\n  cised sound discretion. Because Fulton does not constitute \u201cclearly\n  established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d\n  \u00a72254(d)(1), failure to apply it does not independently authorize ha\n  beas relief under AEDPA. Nor can Fulton be understood merely to il\n  luminate this Court\u2019s decision in Washington, as Washington did not\n  set forth any such test to determine whether a trial judge has exer\n  cised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial. Pp. 11\u201312.\n     (e) The Court does not deny that the trial judge in this case could\n  have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial. Nonetheless,\n  the steps that the Sixth Circuit thought she should have taken were\n  not required\u2014either under this Court\u2019s double jeopardy precedents\n  or, by extension, under AEDPA.

S. C. \u00a72254(d). The District Court in this case issued\nthe writ to respondent Reginald Lett on the ground that\nhis Michigan murder conviction violated the Double Jeop\nardy Clause of the Constitution, and the U. S. Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. In doing so, how\never, these courts misapplied AEDPA\u2019s deferential stan\ndard of review. Because we conclude that the Michigan\nSupreme Court\u2019s application of federal law was not unrea\nsonable, we reverse.\n                              I\n   On August 29, 1996, an argument broke out in a Detroit\nliquor store. The antagonists included Adesoji Latona, a\ntaxi driver; Charles Jones, a passenger who claimed he\nhad been wrongfully ejected from Latona\u2019s cab; and\nReginald Lett, a friend of Jones\u2019s. After the argument\nbegan, Lett left the liquor store, retrieved a handgun from\n2                     RENICO v. LETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanother friend outside in the parking lot, and returned to\nthe store. He shot Latona twice, once in the head and once\nin the chest. Latona died from his wounds shortly thereaf\nter. See People v. Lett, 466 Mich. 206, 208\u2013209, 644 N. W.\n2d 743, 745 (2002).\n   Michigan prosecutors charged Lett with first-degree\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission\nof a felony. His trial took place in June 1997. From jury\nselection to jury instructions the trial took less than nine\nhours, spread over six different days. Id., at 209, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 745.\n   The jury\u2019s deliberations began on June 12, 1997, at 3:24\np.m., and ran that day until 4 p.m. Id., at 209, n. 1, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 745, n. 1. After resuming its work the next\nmorning, the jury sent the trial court a note\u2014one of seven\nit sent out in its two days of deliberations\u2014stating that\nthe jurors had \u201c \u2018a concern about our voice levels disturb\ning any other proceedings that might be going on.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n209, n. 2, 644 N. W. 2d, at 745, n. 2. Later, the jury sent\nout another note, asking \u201c \u2018What if we can\u2019t agree?\n[M]istrial? [R]etrial? [W]hat?\u2019 \u201d Id., at 209, 644 N. W. 2d,\nat 745.\n   The trial transcript does not reveal whether the judge\ndiscussed the jury\u2019s query with counsel, off the record,\nupon receiving this last communication. Id., at 209, n. 3,\n644 N. W. 2d, at 745, n. 3. What is clear is that at 12:45\np.m. the judge called the jury back into the courtroom,\nalong with the prosecutor and defense counsel. Once the\njury was seated, the following exchange took place:\n       \u201cTHE COURT: I received your note asking me what\n    if you can\u2019t agree? And I have to conclude from that\n    that that is your situation at this time. So, I\u2019d like to\n    ask the foreperson to identify themselves, please?\n       \u201cTHE FOREPERSON: [Identified herself.] \n\n       \u201cTHE COURT: Okay, thank you. All right.

Do you believe that it is\n    hopelessly deadlocked?\n       \u201cTHE FOREPERSON: The majority of us don\u2019t be\n    lieve that\u2014\n       \u201cTHE COURT: (Interposing) Don\u2019t say what you\u2019re\n    going to say, okay?\n       \u201cTHE FOREPERSON: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\n       \u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t want to know what your ver\n    dict might be, or how the split is, or any of that.\n    Thank you. Okay? Are you going to reach a unani\n    mous verdict, or not?\n       \u201cTHE FOREPERSON: (No response)\n       \u201cTHE COURT: Yes or no?\n       \u201cTHE FOREPERSON: No, Judge.\u201d Tr. in No. 96\u2013\n    08252 (Recorder\u2019s Court, Detroit, Mich.), pp. 319\u2013320.\n  The judge then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury,\nand scheduled a new trial for later that year. Neither the\nprosecutor nor Lett\u2019s attorney made any objection.\n  Lett\u2019s second trial was held before a different judge and\njury in November 1997. This time, the jury was able to\nreach a unanimous verdict\u2014that Lett was guilty of sec\nond-degree murder\u2014after deliberating for only 3 hours\nand 15 minutes. Lett, supra, at 210, and n. 4, 644 N. W.\n2d, at 746, and n. 4.\n  Lett appealed his conviction to the Michigan Court of\nAppeals. He argued that the judge in his first trial had\nannounced a mistrial without any manifest necessity for\ndoing so. Because the mistrial was an error, Lett main\ntained, the State was barred by the Double Jeopardy\nClause of the U. S. Constitution from trying him a second\ntime. The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed with Lett\nand reversed his conviction.\n4                      RENICO v. LETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The State appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court,\nwhich reversed the Court of Appeals. The court explained\nthat under our decision in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat.\n579 (1824), a defendant may be retried following the dis\ncharge of a deadlocked jury, even if the discharge occurs\nwithout the defendant\u2019s consent. Lett, 466 Mich., at 216\u2013\n217, 644 N. W. 2d, at 749. There is no Double Jeopardy\nClause violation in such circumstances, it noted, so long as\nthe trial court exercised its \u201c \u2018sound discretion\u2019 \u201d in conclud\ning that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was\na \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d for a mistrial. Ibid. (quoting\nPerez, supra, at 580; emphasis deleted). The court further\nobserved that, under our decision in Arizona v. Washing\nton, 434 U. S. 497, 506\u2013510 (1978), an appellate court\nmust generally defer to a trial judge\u2019s determination that\na deadlock has been reached. 466 Mich., at 218\u2013222, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 750\u2013752.\n   After setting forth the applicable law, the Michigan\nSupreme Court determined that the judge at Lett\u2019s first\ntrial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mis\ntrial. Id., at 223, 644 N. W. 2d, at 753. The court cited the\nfacts that the jury \u201chad deliberated for at least four hours\nfollowing a relatively short, and far from complex, trial,\u201d\nthat the jury had sent out several notes, \u201cincluding one\nthat appears to indicate that its discussions may have\nbeen particularly heated,\u201d and\u2014\u201c[m]ost important\u201d\u2014\u201cthat\nthe jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not\ngoing to reach a verdict.\u201d Ibid.\n   Lett petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus.\nAgain he argued that the trial court\u2019s declaration of a\nmistrial constituted an abuse of discretion because there\nwas no manifest necessity to cut short the jury\u2019s delibera\ntions. He further contended that the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of his double jeopardy claim amounted to\n\u201can unreasonable application of . . . clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States,\u201d and thus that he was not barred by\nAEDPA, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), from obtaining federal\nhabeas relief. The District Court agreed and granted the\nwrit. 507 F. Supp. 2d 777 (ED Mich. 2007). On appeal, a\ndivided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit affirmed. 316 Fed. Appx. 421 (2009). The State\npetitioned for review in our Court, and we granted certio\nrari. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  It is important at the outset to define the question be\nfore us. That question is not whether the trial judge\nshould have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it\nwas an abuse of discretion for her to have done so\u2014the\napplicable standard on direct review. The question under\nAEDPA is instead whether the determination of the\nMichigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse of dis\ncretion was \u201can unreasonable application of . . . clearly\nestablished Federal law.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n  We have explained that \u201can unreasonable application of\nfederal law is different from an incorrect application of\nfederal law.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410\n(2000). Indeed, \u201ca federal habeas court may not issue the\nwrit simply because that court concludes in its independ\nent judgment that the relevant state-court decision ap\nplied clearly established federal law erroneously or incor\nrectly.\u201d Id., at 411. Rather, that application must be\n\u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d Id., at 409. This distinction\ncreates \u201ca substantially higher threshold\u201d for obtaining\nrelief than de novo review. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550\nU. S. 465, 473 (2007). AEDPA thus imposes a \u201chighly\ndeferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\u201d\nLindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S. 320, 333, n. 7 (1997), and\n\u201cdemands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of\nthe doubt,\u201d Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002)\n6                            RENICO v. LETT\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(per curiam).1\n   The \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d in this area is\nlargely undisputed. In Perez, we held that when a judge\ndischarges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot\nreach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a\nnew trial for the defendant before a new jury. 9 Wheat., at\n579\u2013580. We explained that trial judges may declare a\nmistrial \u201cwhenever, in their opinion, taking all the cir\ncumstances into consideration, there is a manifest neces\nsity\u201d for doing so. Id., at 580. The decision to declare a\nmistrial is left to the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the judge, but\n\u201cthe power ought to be used with the greatest caution,\nunder urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvi\nous causes.\u201d Ibid.\n   Since Perez, we have clarified that the \u201cmanifest neces\nsity\u201d standard \u201ccannot be interpreted literally,\u201d and that a\nmistrial is appropriate when there is a \u201c \u2018high degree\u2019 \u201d of\nnecessity. Washington, supra, at 506. The decision\nwhether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the \u201cbroad dis\ncretion\u201d of the trial judge, a point that \u201chas been consis\ntently reiterated in decisions of this Court.\u201d Illinois v.\nSomerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462 (1973). See also Gori v.\nUnited States, 367 U. S. 364, 368 (1961).\n   In particular, \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a\nmistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is . . .\naccorded great deference by a reviewing court.\u201d Washing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Thedissent correctly points out that AEDPA itself \u201cnever uses the\nterm \u2018deference.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 19 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But our cases\nhave done so over and over again to describe the effect of the threshold\nrestrictions in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) on granting federal habeas relief to\nstate prisoners.

A \u201cmistrial premised upon the trial\njudge\u2019s belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict [has\nbeen] long considered the classic basis for a proper mis\ntrial.\u201d Id., at 509; see also Downum v. United States, 372\nU. S. 734, 736 (1963) (deadlocked jury is the \u201cclassic ex\nample\u201d of when the State may try the same defendant\ntwice).\n   The reasons for \u201callowing the trial judge to exercise\nbroad discretion\u201d are \u201cespecially compelling\u201d in cases\ninvolving a potentially deadlocked jury. Washington, 434\nU. S., at 509. There, the justification for deference is that\n\u201cthe trial court is in the best position to assess all the\nfactors which must be considered in making a necessarily\ndiscretionary determination whether the jury will be able\nto reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.\u201d Id., at\n510, n. 28. In the absence of such deference, trial judges\nmight otherwise \u201cemploy coercive means to break the\napparent deadlock,\u201d thereby creating a \u201csignificant risk\nthat a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the\nsituation rather than the considered judgment of all the\njurors.\u201d Id., at 510, 509.\n   This is not to say that we grant absolute deference to\ntrial judges in this context. Perez itself noted that the\njudge\u2019s exercise of discretion must be \u201csound,\u201d 9 Wheat., at\n580, and we have made clear that \u201c[i]f the record reveals\nthat the trial judge has failed to exercise the \u2018sound discre\ntion\u2019 entrusted to him, the reason for such deference by an\nappellate court disappears.\u201d Washington, 434 U. S., at\n510, n. 28. Thus \u201cif the trial judge acts for reasons com\npletely unrelated to the trial problem which purports to be\nthe basis for the mistrial ruling, close appellate scrutiny is\nappropriate.\u201d Ibid. Similarly, \u201cif a trial judge acts irra\ntionally or irresponsibly, . . . his action cannot be con\ndoned.\u201d Id., at 514 (citing United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S.\n470 (1971), and Somerville, supra, at 469).\n   We have expressly declined to require the \u201cmechanical\n8                      RENICO v. LETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplication\u201d of any \u201crigid formula\u201d when trial judges de\ncide whether jury deadlock warrants a mistrial. Wade v.\nHunter, 336 U. S. 684, 691, 690 (1949). We have also\nexplicitly held that a trial judge declaring a mistrial is not\nrequired to make explicit findings of \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d\nnor to \u201carticulate on the record all the factors which in\nformed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.\u201d Washing\nton, supra, at 517. And we have never required a trial\njudge, before declaring a mistrial based on jury deadlock,\nto force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of\ntime, to question the jurors individually, to consult with\n(or obtain the consent of) either the prosecutor or defense\ncounsel, to issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to\nconsider any other means of breaking the impasse. In\n1981, then-Justice Rehnquist noted that this Court had\nnever \u201coverturned a trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial\nafter a jury was unable to reach a verdict on the ground\nthat the \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 standard had not been met.\u201d\nWinston v. Moore, 452 U. S. 944, 947 (opinion dissenting\nfrom denial of certiorari). The same remains true today,\nnearly 30 years later.\n   The legal standard applied by the Michigan Supreme\nCourt in this case was whether there was an abuse of the\n\u201cbroad discretion\u201d reserved to the trial judge. Somerville,\nsupra, at 462; Washington, supra, at 509. This type of\ngeneral standard triggers another consideration under\nAEDPA. When assessing whether a state court\u2019s applica\ntion of federal law is unreasonable, \u201cthe range of reason\nable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the\nrelevant rule\u201d that the state court must apply. Yarbor\nough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004). Because\nAEDPA authorizes federal courts to grant relief only when\nstate courts act unreasonably, it follows that \u201c[t]he more\ngeneral the rule\u201d at issue\u2014and thus the greater the poten\ntial for reasoned disagreement among fair-minded\njudges\u2014\u201cthe more leeway [state] courts have in reaching\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 11).\n                              III\n   In light of all the foregoing, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in this case was not unreasonable under\nAEDPA, and the decision of the Court of Appeals to grant\nLett a writ of habeas corpus must be reversed.\n   The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s adjudication involved a\nstraightforward application of our longstanding prece\ndents to the facts of Lett\u2019s case. The court cited our own\ndouble jeopardy cases\u2014from Perez to Washington\u2014\nelaborating upon the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d standard for\ngranting a mistrial and noting the broad deference that\nappellate courts must give trial judges in deciding whether\nthat standard has been met in any given case. Lett, 466\nMich., at 216\u2013222, 644 N. W. 2d, at 749\u2013752. It then\napplied those precedents to the particular facts before it\nand found no abuse of discretion, especially in light of the\nlength of deliberations after a short and uncomplicated\ntrial, the jury notes suggesting heated discussions and\nasking what would happen \u201cif we can\u2019t agree,\u201d and\u2014\n\u201c[m]ost important\u201d\u2014\u201cthe fact that the jury foreperson\nexpressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a\nverdict.\u201d Id., at 223, 644 N. W. 2d, at 753. In these cir\ncumstances, it was reasonable for the Michigan Supreme\nCourt to determine that the trial judge had exercised\nsound discretion in declaring a mistrial.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded\notherwise. It did not contest the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s description of the objective facts, but disagreed\nwith the inferences to be drawn from them. For example,\nit speculated that the trial judge may have misinterpreted\nthe jury\u2019s notes as signs of discord and deadlock when,\nread literally, they expressly stated no such thing. 316\n10                         RENICO v. LETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFed. Appx., at 427. It further determined that the judge\u2019s\nbrief colloquy with the foreperson may have wrongly\nimplied a false equivalence between \u201cmere disagreement\u201d\nand \u201cgenuine deadlock,\u201d and may have given rise to \u201cinap\npropriate pressure\u201d on her to say that the jury would be\nunable to reach a verdict. Id., at 426\u2013427. The trial\njudge\u2019s mistakes were so egregious, in the Court of Ap\npeals\u2019 view, that the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\nfinding no abuse of discretion was not only wrong but\nobjectively unreasonable. Id., at 427.\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the trial record\nis not implausible. Nor, for that matter, is the more in\nventive (surely not \u201ccrude\u201d) speculation of the dissent.\nPost, at 10. After all, the jury only deliberated for four\nhours, its notes were arguably ambiguous, the trial judge\u2019s\ninitial question to the foreperson was imprecise, and the\njudge neither asked for elaboration of the foreperson\u2019s\nanswers nor took any other measures to confirm the fore\nperson\u2019s prediction that a unanimous verdict would not be\nreached.2\n   But other reasonable interpretations of the record are\nalso possible. Lett\u2019s trial was not complex, and there is no\nreason that the jury would necessarily have needed more\nthan a few hours to deliberate over his guilt. The notes\nthe jury sent to the judge certainly could be read as re\nflecting substantial disagreement, even if they did not say\nso outright. Most important, the foreperson expressly told\nthe judge\u2014in response to her unambiguous question \u201cAre\nyou going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?\u201d\u2014that the\njury would be unable to agree. Lett, supra, at 210, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 745.\n   Given the foregoing facts, the Michigan Supreme\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We do not think it reasonable, however, to contend that \u201cthe fore\n\nperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood of deadlock.\u201d\nPost, at 12. She had, after all, participated in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\n                     Cite as: 559 U.

Yarborough, 541 U. S., at 664; see\nalso Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Court of\nAppeals\u2019 ruling in Lett\u2019s favor failed to grant the Michigan\ncourts the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA\nand our double jeopardy precedents.\n   The Court of Appeals also erred in a second respect. It\nrelied upon its own decision in Fulton v. Moore, 520 F. 3d\n522 (CA6 2008), for the proposition \u201cthat Arizona v. Wash\nington sets forth three factors that determine whether a\njudge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mis\ntrial: whether the judge (1) heard the opinions of the\nparties\u2019 counsel about the propriety of the mistrial; (2)\nconsidered the alternatives to a mistrial; and (3) acted\ndeliberately, instead of abruptly.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx., at 426.\nIt then cited Fulton\u2019s interpretation of Washington to\nbuttress its conclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court\nerred in concluding that the trial judge had exercised\nsound discretion. 316 Fed. Appx., at 428.\n   The Fulton decision, however, does not constitute\n\u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 It is not necessary for us to decide whether the Michigan Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s decision\u2014or, for that matter, the trial judge\u2019s declaration of a\nmistrial\u2014was right or wrong. The latter question, in particular, is a\nclose one. As Lett points out, at a hearing before the Michigan Court of\nAppeals, the state prosecutor expressed the view that the judge had in\nfact erred in dismissing the jury and declaring a mistrial. The Michi\ngan Supreme Court declined to accept this confession of error, People v.\nLett, 463 Mich. 939, 620 N. W. 2d 855 (2000), and in any event\u2014for the\nreasons we have explained\u2014whether the trial judge was right or wrong\nis not the pertinent question under AEDPA.\n12                      RENICO v. LETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSupreme Court,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), so any failure to apply that\ndecision cannot independently authorize habeas relief\nunder AEDPA. Nor, as the dissent suggests, can Fulton\nbe understood merely to \u201cilluminat[e]\u201d Washington. Post,\nat 18. Washington nowhere established these three fac\ntors as a constitutional test that \u201cdetermine[s]\u201d whether a\ntrial judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a\nmistrial. 316 Fed. Appx., at 426.\n   In concluding that Lett is not entitled to a writ of ha\nbeas corpus, we do not deny that the trial judge could have\nbeen more thorough before declaring a mistrial. As the\nCourt of Appeals pointed out, id., at 427\u2013428, she could\nhave asked the foreperson additional followup questions,\ngranted additional time for further deliberations, or con\nsulted with the prosecutor and defense counsel before\nacting. Any of these steps would have been appropriate\nunder the circumstances. None, however, was required\u2014\neither under our double jeopardy precedents or, by exten\nsion, under AEDPA.\n                         *     *    *\n  AEDPA prevents defendants\u2014and federal courts\u2014from\nusing federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to second\nguess the reasonable decisions of state courts. Whether or\nnot the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s opinion reinstating\nLett\u2019s conviction in this case was correct, it was clearly not\nunreasonable. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Yet what this history\ndemonstrates\u2014and what has not changed\u2014is the respect\nowed \u201ca defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial com\npleted by a particular tribunal.\u201d Wade v.

United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187\u2013188\n(1957).9\n   We have come over the years to recognize that jury\ncoercion poses a serious threat to jurors and defendants\nalike, and that the accused\u2019s interest in a single proceed\ning must sometimes yield \u201cto the public\u2019s interest in fair\ntrials designed to end in just judgments,\u201d Wade, 336 U. S.,\nat 689; and we have therefore carved out exceptions to the\ncommon-law rule. But the exceptions are narrow. For a\nmistrial to be granted at the prosecutor\u2019s request, \u201cthe\nprosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the\nmistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His\nburden is a heavy one.\u201d Washington, 434 U. S., at 505. A\njudge who acts sua sponte in declaring a mistrial must\nsimilarly make sure, and must enable a reviewing court to\nconfirm, that there is a \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d to deprive\nthe defendant of his valued right. Ibid.\n   In this case, the trial judge did not meet that burden.\nThe record suggests that she discharged the jury without\nconsidering any less extreme courses of action, and the\nrecord makes quite clear that she did not fully appreciate\nthe scope or significance of the ancient right at stake.

Perez,\n9 Wheat. 579 (1824).\u201d Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458,\n461 (1973).10 Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice\nStory articulated a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d standard that\ncontinues to govern the double jeopardy analysis for mis\ntrial orders:\n     \u201cWe think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has\n     invested Courts of justice with the authority to dis\n     charge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in\n     their opinion, taking all the circumstances into con\n     sideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or\n     the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\n     They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject;\n     and it is impossible to define all the circumstances,\n     which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure,\n     the power ought to be used with the greatest caution,\n     under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and\n     obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, Courts\n     should be extremely careful how they interfere with\n     any of the chances of life, in favour of the prisoner.\n     But, after all, they have the right to order the dis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 See also Gori v.

Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824).\n   This passage, too, is worthy of repetition, because in it\nthe Perez Court struck a careful balance. The Court estab\nlished the authority of trial judges to discharge the jury\nprior to verdict, but in recognition of the novelty and\npotential injustice of the practice, the Court subjected that\nauthority to several constraints: The judge may not de\nclare a mistrial unless \u201cthere is a manifest necessity for\nthe act\u201d or \u201cthe ends of public justice\u201d so require; and in\ndetermining whether such conditions exist, the judge must\nexercise \u201csound discretion,\u201d \u201cconscientious[ness],\u201d and \u201cthe\ngreatest caution,\u201d reserving the discharge power for \u201cur\ngent circumstances\u201d and \u201cvery plain and obvious causes.\u201d\nIbid. What exact circumstances and causes would meet\nthat bar, the Court declined to specify. Recognizing that\ntrial proceedings may raise innumerable complications, so\nthat \u201cit is impossible to define\u201d in advance all of the possi\nble grounds for \u201cinterfere[nce],\u201d the Court set forth general\nstandards for judicial conduct rather than categorical\nrules for specific classes of situations. Ibid.\n   The seeds of our entire jurisprudence on the permissibil\nity of retrial following an initial mistrial are packed into\nthis one passage.

Ante, at 6\u20138. But the review\ning court still has an important role to play; the applica\ntion of deference \u201cdoes not, of course, end the inquiry.\u201d\nWashington, 434 U. S., at 514. \u201cIn order to ensure that\n[the defendant\u2019s constitutional] interest is adequately\nprotected, reviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy\nthemselves that, in the words of Mr. Justice Story, the\ntrial judge exercised \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a\nmistrial.\u201d Ibid. \u201cIf the record reveals that the trial judge\nhas failed to exercise the \u2018sound discretion\u2019 entrusted to\nhim, the reason for . . . deference by an appellate court\ndisappears.\u201d Id., at 510, n. 28. And while trial judges\nneed not follow any precise regimen to facilitate appellate\nreview, they must at least take care to ensure that \u201c[t]he\nbasis for [a] mistrial order is adequately disclosed by the\nrecord.\u201d Id., at 517.\n   Our precedents contain examples of judicial action on\nboth sides of the line. We have, for instance, allowed a\nsecond trial when the jurors in the first trial, after 40\nhours of deliberation, \u201cannounced in open court that they\nwere unable to agree,\u201d and no \u201cspecific and traversable\nfact[s]\u201d called their deadlock into question. Logan v.\nUnited States, 144 U. S. 263, 298 (1892). We have like\nwise permitted reprosecution when the initial judge heard\n\u201cextended argument\u201d from both parties on the mistrial\nmotion, acted with evident \u201cconcern for the possible double\njeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling,\u201d and \u201cac\ncorded careful consideration to [the defendant\u2019s] interest\nin having the trial concluded in a single proceeding.\u201d\nWashington, 434 U.

And we\nhave opined that, while trial judges have considerable\nleeway in deciding whether to discharge the jury, \u201c[w]e\nresolve any doubt in favor of the liberty of the citizen,\nrather than exercise what would be an unlimited, uncer\ntain, and arbitrary judicial discretion.\u201d Downum, 372\nU.

If the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d and \u201csound\ndiscretion\u201d standards are to have any force, we must\ndemand more from our trial courts.\n   It is probably fair to say that this trial was not espe\ncially complex, ante, at 4, 10, but neither was it a trivial\naffair. Lett was charged with the most serious of crimes,\nfirst-degree murder, as well as possession of a firearm\nduring the commission of a felony. He faced a potential\nsentence of life imprisonment if convicted. Seventeen\nwitnesses provided testimony over the course of 10 calen\ndar days. See 507 F. Supp. 2d 777, 779, 785\u2013786 (ED\nMich. 2007); see also id., at 785 (discussing \u201cpiecemeal\nfashion\u201d in which evidence was presented to the jury).\n   The jury\u2019s first period of deliberation on Thursday after\nnoon lasted less than 40 minutes. \u201cThe jury likely spent\u201d\nthat brief session \u201cdoing little more than electing a fore\nperson.\u201d People v. Lett, 466 Mich. 206, 227, 644 N. W. 2d\n743, 755 (2002) (Cavanagh, J., dissenting). The jury de\nliberated a few more hours on Friday morning prior to\ndischarge. During that time, it sent the trial court seven\n                  Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nnotes. Most were inconsequential, routine queries. The\nfirst note on Friday morning raised \u201c \u2018a concern about [the\njurors\u2019] voice levels,\u2019 \u201d Letter from M. McCowan to Clerk of\nCourt (Mar. 4, 2010), p. 2, but nothing in the record re\nlates this concern to the substance or tenor of their discus\nsion. At 12:27 p.m., the jury sent the fateful missive,\nasking: \u201c \u2018What if we can\u2019t agree? [M]istrial? [R]etrial?\n[W]hat?\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Seconds later, still at 12:27 p.m., the jury\nsent another note: \u201c \u2018What about lunch?\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   At 12:45 p.m., the trial judge initiated a colloquy with\nthe foreperson that concluded in the mistrial declaration.\nSee ante, at 2\u20133 (reproducing transcript of colloquy). Even\naccounting for the imprecision of oral communication, the\njudge made an inordinate number of logical and legal\nmissteps during this short exchange. Cf. Somerville, 410\nU. S., at 469 (critiquing \u201cerratic\u201d mistrial inquiry). It does\nnot take much exegetical skill to spot them.\n   The judge began by stating: \u201c \u2018I received your note ask\ning me what if you can\u2019t agree? And I have to conclude\nfrom that that that is your situation at this time.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 2. This \u201c \u2018conclu[sion]\u2019 \u201d was a non sequitur. The note\nasked what would happen if the jury could not agree; it\ngave no indication that the jury had already reached an\nirrevocable impasse. The judge ignored the request for\ninformation that the note actually contained. Instead, she\nannounced that deadlock was the jury\u2019s \u201c \u2018situation at this\ntime,\u2019 \u201d thereby prejudging the question she had ostensibly\nsummoned the foreperson to probe: namely, whether the\njury was in fact deadlocked.\n    The judge continued: \u201c \u2018I need to ask you if the jury is\ndeadlocked; in other words, is there a disagreement as to\nthe verdict?\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 2\u20133. As the Federal Court of Ap\npeals observed, this question \u201cimproperly conflated dead\nlock with mere disagreement.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx. 421, 426\n(CA6 2009). Deadlock is a \u201ccondition or situation in which\nit is impossible to proceed or act; a complete standstill.\u201d 4\n10                    RENICO v. LETT\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nOxford English Dictionary 290 (2d ed. 1989). Disagree\nment among jurors is perfectly normal and does not come\nclose to approaching the \u201cimperious necessity\u201d we have\nrequired for their discharge. Downum, 372 U. S., at 736.\n   The trial judge then modulated her inquiry: \u201c \u2018Do you\nbelieve [the jury] is hopelessly deadlocked?\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 3.\nThe foreperson was in the midst of replying, \u201c \u2018The major\nity of us don\u2019t believe that\u2014,\u2019 \u201d when the judge appears to\nhave cut her off. Ibid. One cannot \u201cfault the trial judge\u201d\nfor wanting \u201cto preserve the secrecy of jury deliberations,\u201d\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787, but two aspects of the foreperson\u2019s\ntruncated reply are notable. First, it \u201ctends to show that\nthe foreperson did not feel prepared to declare definitively\nthat the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.\u201d Ibid. If she had\nbeen so prepared, then it is hard to see why she would\nbegin her response with a descriptive account of the \u201c \u2018ma\njority\u2019 \u201d viewpoint.\n   Second, the foreperson\u2019s reply suggests the jury may\nhave been leaning toward acquittal. Admittedly, this is\ncrude speculation, but it is entirely possible that the fore\nperson was in the process of saying, \u201cThe majority of us\ndon\u2019t believe that he\u2019s guilty.\u201d Or: \u201cThe majority of us\ndon\u2019t believe that there is sufficient evidence to prove one\nof the counts.\u201d (On retrial, Lett was convicted on both\ncounts.) These possibilities are, I submit, linguistically\nmore probable than something like the following: \u201cThe\nmajority of us don\u2019t believe that Lett is guilty, whereas a\nminority of us believe that he is\u2014and we are hopelessly\ndeadlocked on the matter.\u201d And they are logically far more\nprobable than something along the lines of, \u201cThe majority\nof us don\u2019t believe that we will ever be able to reach a\nverdict,\u201d as the foreperson had been given no opportunity\nto poll her colleagues on this point. Yet only such implau\nsible endings could have supported a conclusion that it\n                    Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nwas manifestly necessary to discharge the jury.14\n   The judge then steered the conversation back to the\nissue of deadlock, asking: \u201c \u2018Are you going to reach a unani\nmous verdict, or not?\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 3. After the foreperson\nhesitated, the judge persisted: \u201c \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The\nforeperson replied: \u201c \u2018No, Judge.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Two aspects of\nthis interchange are also notable. First, the judge\u2019s ques\ntion, though \u201cvery direct,\u201d was \u201cactually rather ambigu\nous,\u201d because it gave the foreperson no temporal or legal\ncontext within which to understand what was being asked.\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787. \u201cThe foreperson could have easily\nthought the judge meant, \u2018Are you going to reach a\nunanimous verdict in the next hour?\u2019 or \u2018before the lunch\nrecess?\u2019 or \u2018by the end of the day?\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (emphasis de\nleted). Even if the foreperson assumed no time constraint,\nshe could have easily thought the judge meant, \u201cAre you,\nin your estimation, more likely than not to reach a unani\nmous verdict?\u201d An affirmative answer to that question\nwould likewise fall far short of manifest necessity.\n   Second, the foreperson\u2019s hesitation suggests a lack of\nconfidence in her position. That alone ought to have called\ninto question the propriety of a mistrial order. But the\njudge bore down and demanded an unqualified answer,\n\u201c \u2018Yes or no.\u2019 \u201d Most of the time when we worry about\njudicial coercion of juries, we worry about judges pressur\ning them, in the common-law manner, to keep deliberating\nuntil they return a verdict they may not otherwise have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 Another reading of the foreperson\u2019s reply is available: Her state\n\nment,\u201c \u2018The majority of us don\u2019t believe that,\u2019 \u201d may have been a com\nplete sentence. In other words, she may have meant to convey, \u201cThe\nmajority of us don\u2019t believe that we are hopelessly deadlocked.\u201d The\ntrial-court transcript places an em dash rather than a period after the\nword \u201cthat,\u201d but this is hardly dispositive evidence of intonation or\nintent. However, the trial judge\u2019s contemporaneous reaction, the fact\nthat the foreperson was not permitted to consult with the other jurors\non the issue of deadlock, and respondent\u2019s failure to advance this\nreading undercut its plausibility.\n12                    RENICO v. LETT\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nchosen. This judge exerted pressure so as to prevent the\njury from reaching any verdict at all. In so doing, she cut\noff deliberations well before the point when it was clear\nthey would no longer be fruitful. Recall that prior to\nsummoning the foreperson for their colloquy, the trial\njudge gave her no opportunity to consult with the other\njurors on the matter that would be discussed. So, the\nforeperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood\nof deadlock. Recall, as well, that almost immediately after\nsending the judge a note asking what would happen if\nthey disagreed, the jury sent a note asking about lunch.\nPlainly, this was a group that was prepared to go on with\nits work.\n   The judge then declared a mistrial on the spot. Her\nentire exchange with the foreperson took three minutes,\nfrom 12:45 p.m. to 12:48 p.m. App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a\u2013\n94a. The entire jury deliberations took roughly four\nhours. The judge gave the parties no opportunity to com\nment on the foreperson\u2019s remarks, much less on the ques\ntion of mistrial. Cf. Washington, 434 U. S., at 515\u2013516\n(trial judge \u201cgave both defense counsel and the prosecutor\nfull opportunity to explain their positions on the propriety\nof a mistrial\u201d); Fed. Rule Crim.

For example, the judge did\nnot poll the jurors, give an instruction ordering further\ndeliberations, query defense counsel about his thoughts on\ncontinued deliberations, or indicate on the record why a\nmistrial declaration was necessary.\u201d Lett, 466 Mich., at\n227\u2013228, 644 N.

The\nmanner in which this discharge decision was made con\ntravened standard trial-court guidelines.15 The judge may\nnot have had a constitutional obligation to take any one of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 See, e.g., ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Discovery and Trial\nby Jury 15\u20135.4, pp. 256\u2013257 (3d ed. 1996) (\u201cA trial judge should be able\nto send the jury back for further deliberations notwithstanding its\nindication that it has been unable to agree.

In\ndeed, I fail to see how a record could disclose much less\nevidence of sound decisionmaking. Within the realm of\nrealistic, nonpretextual possibilities, this mistrial declara\ntion was about as precipitate as one is liable to find.\nDespite the multitude of cases involving hung-jury mistri\nals that have arisen over the years, neither petitioner nor\nthe Court has been able to identify any in which such\nabrupt judicial action has been upheld. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 12\u201315. Even the prosecutor felt compelled to ac\nknowledge that the trial court\u2019s decision to discharge the\njury \u201c \u2018clearly was error.\u2019 \u201d 316 Fed.

The court suggested that an abuse of dis\ncretion should only be found \u201c \u2018when the result is \u201cso pal\npably and grossly violative of fact and logic that it evi\ndences not the exercise of will but perversity of will, not\nthe exercise of judgment but defiance thereof.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Lett, 466\nMich., at 221, n. 12, 644 N.

Indeed, it would\nhave been \u201cremarkable\u201d if the jurors \u201ccould review the\ntestimony of all [the] witnesses in the time they were\ngiven, let alone conclude that they were deadlocked.\u201d 507\nF. Supp. 2d, at 786. The jury\u2019s note pertaining to its vol\nume level does not necessarily indicate anything about the\n\u201cheated[ness],\u201d Lett, 466 Mich., at 223, 644 N.

Al\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 Like the trial court before it, the Michigan Supreme Court did not\nmake any factual findings to bolster its unreasonable legal conclusion.\nAs the State Court of Appeals noted, the trial judge declared a mistrial\nas soon as she extracted a suggestive answer from the foreperson. She\n\u201cnever even found on the record that the jury was genuinely dead\nlocked.\u201d People v. Lett, No. 209513, 2000 WL 33423221, *4 (Apr. 21,\n2000) (per curiam); see also People v.

The Michigan Supreme Court expressly declined to\ncommit to the position that the jury really was deadlocked or that\nmanifest necessity really did exist. See, e.g., id., at 220, 644 N. W. 2d,\nat 751 (\u201cThe issue is not whether this Court would have found manifest\nnecessity\u201d). Accordingly, even if 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(1) were to apply to\nthis appeal, there were no \u201cdetermination[s] of a factual issue made by\na State court\u201d that we would have to \u201cpresum[e] to be correct.\u201d In any\nevent, none of the relevant facts in the case are disputed, and no\nargument concerning \u00a72254(e)(1) was properly raised in this Court or\npassed upon below.\n16                          RENICO v. LETT\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthough it would have been preferable if Lett had tried to\nlodge an objection, defense counsel was given no meaning\nful opportunity to do so\u2014the judge discharged the jury\nsimultaneously with her mistrial order, counsel received\nno advance notice of either action, and he may not even\nhave been informed of the content of the jury\u2019s notes. See\nante, at 2; 316 Fed. Appx., at 428 (\u201cAt no point before the\nactual declaration of the mistrial was it even mentioned\non the record as a potential course of action by the court.\nThe summary nature of the trial court\u2019s actions . . . ren\ndered an objection both unlikely and meaningless\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)). Counsel\u2019s failure to object\nis therefore legally irrelevant.17 And, as detailed above,\nthe foreperson\u2019s remarks were far more equivocal and\nambiguous, in context, than the Michigan Supreme Court\nallowed.\n   The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s defense of the trial\ncourt\u2019s actions is thus weak on its own terms. It collapses\nentirely under the weight of the many defects in the trial\ncourt\u2019s process, virtually all of which the court either\noverlooked or discounted.\n   The unreasonableness of the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision is highlighted by the decisions of the three other\ncourts that have addressed Lett\u2019s double jeopardy claim,\neach of which ruled in his favor, as well as the dissent\nfiled by two Michigan Supreme Court Justices and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See Jorn, 400 U.

While a defendant\u2019s affirmative\nrequest for or consent to a mistrial may be relevant to the double\njeopardy inquiry, see, e.g., Jorn, 400 U. S., at 485 (plurality opinion), we\nhave never suggested that defendants must object to such orders to\npreserve a claim, much less object to an order issued sua sponte and\nwithout any advance notice.\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

This Court\u2019s deci\nsion unfortunately compounds the deleterious conse\nquences of the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. \u201cAl\nthough the trial judge\u2019s decision is entitled to great\ndeference, it is not the place of a reviewing court to extract\nfactoids from the record in an attempt to salvage a bad\ndecision.\u201d 507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787.\n                             III\n   The Court does not really try to vindicate the Michigan\nSupreme Court on the merits, but instead ascribes today\u2019s\noutcome to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA). The foregoing analysis shows why\nthe Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s ruling cannot be saved by\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), however construed. That ruling\nwas not only incorrect but also unreasonable by any fair\nmeasure. Three particular facets of the Court\u2019s AEDPA\nanalysis require a brief comment.\n   First, the fact that the substantive legal standard ap\nplied by the state court \u201cis a general one\u201d has no bearing\non the standard of review. Ante, at 11. We have said that\n\u201c[t]he more general the rule, the more leeway courts have\nin reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004). But\nthis statement stands only for the unremarkable proposi\ntion that more broadly framed rules will tend to encom\npass a broader set of conforming applications. Regardless\nof the nature of the legal principle at issue, the task of a\nfederal court remains the same under \u00a72254(d)(1): to\ndetermine whether the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law.\u201d General standards are no less\nbinding law than discrete rules.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 In recognition of this basic insight, our precedents \u201chave made\n\nclear\u201d that a state-court decision may be \u201cunreasonable\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a72254(d)(1) when the \u201cstate court has misapplied a \u2018govern\n18                          RENICO v. LETT\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Second, I do not agree that the Federal Court of Appeals\n\u201cerred\u201d by \u201crel[ying] upon its own decision\u201d applying Ari\nzona v. Washington. Ante, at 11. The Sixth Circuit was\nwell aware that its own decision \u201cdoes not constitute\n\u2018clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11\u201312 (quoting \u00a72254(d)(1)).\nThe panel expressly stated that it \u201creview[ed] the Michi\ngan Supreme Court\u2019s decision to determine only whether\nit was objectively unreasonable in light of the holdings of\nthe Supreme Court.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx., at 425. The panel\nexamined its own precedents not as the relevant \u201cclearly\nestablished Federal law\u201d under AEDPA, but as a tool for\nilluminating the precise contours of that law. Lower\ncourts routinely look to circuit cases to \u201cprovide evidence\nthat Supreme Court precedents ha[ve] clearly established\na rule as of a particular time or [to] shed light on the\n\u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the state courts\u2019 application of existing\nSupreme Court precedents.\u201d 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a732.3,\np. 1585, n. 10 (5th ed. 2005) (hereinafter Hertz & Lieb\nman). This is a healthy practice\u2014indeed, a vital practice,\nconsidering how few cases this Court decides\u2014and we\nhave never disapproved it.\n   Finally, I do not agree that AEDPA authorizes \u201cthe dual\nlayers of deference\u201d the Court has utilized in this case.\nAnte, at 11. There is little doubt that AEDPA \u201cdirects\nfederal courts to attend to every state-court judgment with\nutmost care.\u201d Williams, 529 U.

This is a critical\nfeature of our AEDPA jurisprudence. Federal habeas review would be\nmeaningless if, for relief to be granted, we required a perfect congru\nence between the facts that gave rise to our governing precedents and\nthe facts that confronted the state court in any particular case.\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

But the statute never uses the term \u201cdefer\nence,\u201d and the legislative history makes clear that Con\ngress meant to preserve robust federal-court review. Id.,\nat 386\u2013387; see also Hertz & Liebman \u00a732.3, at 1587\u2013\n1589, n. 13 (summarizing congressional record and noting\nthat \u201c[t]he aspect of prior practice that most troubled\nAEDPA\u2019s supporters was the federal court\u2019s inattention to,\nand lack of respect for, state court decisions that the fed\neral court, if it only looked, would find to be legally cor\nrect\u201d). Any attempt to prevent federal courts from exercis\ning independent review of habeas applications would have\nbeen a radical reform of dubious constitutionality, and\nCongress \u201cwould have spoken with much greater clarity\u201d if\nthat had been its intent.

If a federal judge\nwere firmly convinced that such a decision were wrong,\nthen in my view not only would he have no statutory duty\nto uphold it, but he might also have a constitutional obli\ngation to reverse it. And regardless of how one conceptu\nalizes the distinction between an incorrect and an \u201cunrea\nsonable\u201d state-court ruling under \u00a72254(d)(1), one must\nalways determine whether the ruling was wrong to be able\nto test the magnitude of any error. Substantive and meth\nodological considerations compel federal courts to give\nhabeas claims a full, independent review\u2014and then to\ndecide for themselves. Even under AEDPA, there is no\nescaping the burden of judgment.\n                       *    *     *\n  In this case, Reginald Lett\u2019s constitutional rights were\nviolated when the trial court terminated his first trial\nwithout adequate justification and he was subsequently\nprosecuted for the same offense.

Argued March 29, 2010\u2014Decided May 3, 2010\nFrom jury selection to jury instructions in a Michigan court, respondent\n  Lett\u2019s first trial for, inter alia, first-degree murder took less than nine\n  hours. During approximately four hours of deliberations, the jury\n  sent the trial court seven notes, including one asking what would\n  happen if the jury could not agree. The judge called the jury and the\n  attorneys into the courtroom and questioned the foreperson, who said\n  that the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The judge\n  then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury, and scheduled a new\n  trial. At Lett\u2019s second trial, after deliberating for only 3 hours and 15\n  minutes, a new jury found him guilty of second-degree murder. On\n  appeal, Lett argued that because the judge in his first trial had an\n  nounced a mistrial without any manifest necessity to do so, the Dou\n  ble Jeopardy Clause barred the State from trying him a second time.\n  Agreeing, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.\n  The Michigan Supreme Court reversed. It concluded that, under\n  United States v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580, a defendant may be retried\n  following the discharge of a deadlocked jury so long as the trial court\n  exercised its \u201csound discretion\u201d in concluding that the jury was dead\n  locked and thus that there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial;\n  and that, under Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 506\u2013510, an\n  appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge\u2019s determination\n  that a deadlock has been reached. It then found that the judge at\n  Lett\u2019s first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mis\n  trial, observing that the jury had deliberated a sufficient amount of\n  time following a short, noncomplex trial; that the jury had sent sev\n  eral notes, including one appearing to indicate heated discussions;\n  and that the foreperson had stated that the jury could not reach a\n  verdict. In Lett\u2019s federal habeas petition, he contended that the\n2                           RENICO v. LETT\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of his double jeopardy claim was\n    \u201can unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law,\n    as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28\n    U.

The District Court granted the writ,\n    and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision in this case was\n not unreasonable under AEDPA, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting\n Lett habeas relief.

When a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury\n cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a\n new trial for the defendant before a new jury, Perez, 9 Wheat., at\n 579\u2013580. Trial judges may declare a mistrial when, \u201cin their opinion,\n taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest\n necessity\u201d for doing so, id., at 580, i.e., a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity,\n Washington, supra, at 506. The decision whether to grant a mistrial\n is reserved to the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d of the trial judge, Illinois v.\n Somerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462, and the discretion \u201cto declare a mis\n trial [for a deadlocked jury] is . . . accorded great deference by a re\n viewing court,\u201d Washington, supra, at 510, although this deference is\n not absolute. This Court has expressly declined to require the \u201cme\n chanical application\u201d of any \u201crigid formula,\u201d Wade v. Hunter, 336\n U. S. 684, 690\u2013691, when a trial judge decides to declare a mistrial\n due to jury deadlock, and it has explicitly held that the judge is not\n required to make explicit findings of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d or \u201carticu\n late on the record all the factors\u201d informing his discretion, Washing\n ton, supra, at 517. The Court has never required a judge in these cir\n cumstances to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of\n time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with counsel, to\n issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to consider any other means\n of breaking the impasse. Moreover, the legal standard applied by the\n Michigan Supreme Court is a general one\u2014whether there was an\n abuse of the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d reserved to the trial judge, Somerville,\n supra, at 462.

Alvarado, 541\n  U. S. 652, 664. Pp. 6\u20139.\n     (c) The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s adjudication involved a straight\n  forward application of this Court\u2019s longstanding precedents to the\n  facts of Lett\u2019s case. The state court cited this Court\u2019s double jeopardy\n  cases\u2014from Perez to Washington\u2014applying those precedents to the\n  particular facts before it and finding no abuse of discretion in light of\n  the length of deliberations following a short, uncomplicated trial, the\n  jury\u2019s notes to the judge, and the fact that the foreperson stated that\n  the jury could not reach a verdict. It was thus reasonable for the\n  court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion\n  in declaring a mistrial. The Sixth Circuit concluded otherwise be\n  cause it disagreed with the inferences that the Michigan Supreme\n  Court had drawn from the facts. The Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation is\n  not implausible, but other reasonable interpretations of the record\n  are also possible. It was not objectively unreasonable for the Michi\n  gan Supreme Court to conclude that the trial judge\u2019s exercise of dis\n  cretion was sound, both in light of what happened at trial and the\n  fact that the relevant legal standard is a general one, to which there\n  is no \u201cplainly correct or incorrect\u201d answer in this case. Yarborough,\n  supra, at 664. The Sixth Circuit failed to grant the Michigan courts\n  the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA and this Court\u2019s dou\n  ble jeopardy precedents. Pp. 9\u201311.\n     (d) The Sixth Circuit also erred in relying on its own Fulton v.\n  Moore decision for the proposition that Arizona v. Washington sets\n  forth three specific factors that determine whether a judge has exer\n  cised sound discretion. Because Fulton does not constitute \u201cclearly\n  established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,\u201d\n  \u00a72254(d)(1), failure to apply it does not independently authorize ha\n  beas relief under AEDPA. Nor can Fulton be understood merely to il\n  luminate this Court\u2019s decision in Washington, as Washington did not\n  set forth any such test to determine whether a trial judge has exer\n  cised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial. Pp. 11\u201312.\n     (e) The Court does not deny that the trial judge in this case could\n  have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial. Nonetheless,\n  the steps that the Sixth Circuit thought she should have taken were\n  not required\u2014either under this Court\u2019s double jeopardy precedents\n  or, by extension, under AEDPA.

S. C. \u00a72254(d). The District Court in this case issued\nthe writ to respondent Reginald Lett on the ground that\nhis Michigan murder conviction violated the Double Jeop\nardy Clause of the Constitution, and the U. S. Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. In doing so, how\never, these courts misapplied AEDPA\u2019s deferential stan\ndard of review. Because we conclude that the Michigan\nSupreme Court\u2019s application of federal law was not unrea\nsonable, we reverse.\n                              I\n   On August 29, 1996, an argument broke out in a Detroit\nliquor store. The antagonists included Adesoji Latona, a\ntaxi driver; Charles Jones, a passenger who claimed he\nhad been wrongfully ejected from Latona\u2019s cab; and\nReginald Lett, a friend of Jones\u2019s. After the argument\nbegan, Lett left the liquor store, retrieved a handgun from\n2                     RENICO v.

W.\n2d 743, 745 (2002).\n   Michigan prosecutors charged Lett with first-degree\nmurder and possession of a firearm during the commission\nof a felony. His trial took place in June 1997. From jury\nselection to jury instructions the trial took less than nine\nhours, spread over six different days. Id., at 209, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 745.\n   The jury\u2019s deliberations began on June 12, 1997, at 3:24\np.m., and ran that day until 4 p.m. Id., at 209, n. 1, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 745, n. 1. After resuming its work the next\nmorning, the jury sent the trial court a note\u2014one of seven\nit sent out in its two days of deliberations\u2014stating that\nthe jurors had \u201c \u2018a concern about our voice levels disturb\ning any other proceedings that might be going on.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n209, n. 2, 644 N. W. 2d, at 745, n. 2. Later, the jury sent\nout another note, asking \u201c \u2018What if we can\u2019t agree?\n[M]istrial? [R]etrial? [W]hat?\u2019 \u201d Id., at 209, 644 N. W. 2d,\nat 745.\n   The trial transcript does not reveal whether the judge\ndiscussed the jury\u2019s query with counsel, off the record,\nupon receiving this last communication. Id., at 209, n. 3,\n644 N. W. 2d, at 745, n. 3. What is clear is that at 12:45\np.m. the judge called the jury back into the courtroom,\nalong with the prosecutor and defense counsel. Once the\njury was seated, the following exchange took place:\n       \u201cTHE COURT: I received your note asking me what\n    if you can\u2019t agree?

Neither the\nprosecutor nor Lett\u2019s attorney made any objection.\n  Lett\u2019s second trial was held before a different judge and\njury in November 1997. This time, the jury was able to\nreach a unanimous verdict\u2014that Lett was guilty of sec\nond-degree murder\u2014after deliberating for only 3 hours\nand 15 minutes. Lett, supra, at 210, and n. 4, 644 N. W.\n2d, at 746, and n. 4.\n  Lett appealed his conviction to the Michigan Court of\nAppeals. He argued that the judge in his first trial had\nannounced a mistrial without any manifest necessity for\ndoing so. Because the mistrial was an error, Lett main\ntained, the State was barred by the Double Jeopardy\nClause of the U. S. Constitution from trying him a second\ntime. The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed with Lett\nand reversed his conviction.\n4                      RENICO v. LETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The State appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court,\nwhich reversed the Court of Appeals. The court explained\nthat under our decision in United States v. Perez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1824), a defendant may be retried following the dis\ncharge of a deadlocked jury, even if the discharge occurs\nwithout the defendant\u2019s consent. Lett, 466 Mich., at 216\u2013\n217, 644 N. W. 2d, at 749. There is no Double Jeopardy\nClause violation in such circumstances, it noted, so long as\nthe trial court exercised its \u201c \u2018sound discretion\u2019 \u201d in conclud\ning that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was\na \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d for a mistrial. Ibid. (quoting\nPerez, supra, at 580; emphasis deleted). The court further\nobserved that, under our decision in Arizona v. Washing\nton, 434 U. S. 497, 506\u2013510 (1978), an appellate court\nmust generally defer to a trial judge\u2019s determination that\na deadlock has been reached. 466 Mich., at 218\u2013222, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 750\u2013752.\n   After setting forth the applicable law, the Michigan\nSupreme Court determined that the judge at Lett\u2019s first\ntrial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mis\ntrial. Id., at 223, 644 N. W. 2d, at 753. The court cited the\nfacts that the jury \u201chad deliberated for at least four hours\nfollowing a relatively short, and far from complex, trial,\u201d\nthat the jury had sent out several notes, \u201cincluding one\nthat appears to indicate that its discussions may have\nbeen particularly heated,\u201d and\u2014\u201c[m]ost important\u201d\u2014\u201cthat\nthe jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not\ngoing to reach a verdict.\u201d Ibid.\n   Lett petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus.\nAgain he argued that the trial court\u2019s declaration of a\nmistrial constituted an abuse of discretion because there\nwas no manifest necessity to cut short the jury\u2019s delibera\ntions. He further contended that the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s rejection of his double jeopardy claim amounted to\n\u201can unreasonable application of . . . clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\n                 Cite as: 559 U.

S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  It is important at the outset to define the question be\nfore us. That question is not whether the trial judge\nshould have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it\nwas an abuse of discretion for her to have done so\u2014the\napplicable standard on direct review. The question under\nAEDPA is instead whether the determination of the\nMichigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse of dis\ncretion was \u201can unreasonable application of . . . clearly\nestablished Federal law.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n  We have explained that \u201can unreasonable application of\nfederal law is different from an incorrect application of\nfederal law.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 410\n(2000). Indeed, \u201ca federal habeas court may not issue the\nwrit simply because that court concludes in its independ\nent judgment that the relevant state-court decision ap\nplied clearly established federal law erroneously or incor\nrectly.\u201d Id., at 411. Rather, that application must be\n\u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d Id., at 409. This distinction\ncreates \u201ca substantially higher threshold\u201d for obtaining\nrelief than de novo review. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550\nU. S. 465, 473 (2007). AEDPA thus imposes a \u201chighly\ndeferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\u201d\nLindh v. Murphy, 521 U.

LETT\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(per curiam).1\n   The \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d in this area is\nlargely undisputed. In Perez, we held that when a judge\ndischarges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot\nreach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a\nnew trial for the defendant before a new jury. 9 Wheat., at\n579\u2013580. We explained that trial judges may declare a\nmistrial \u201cwhenever, in their opinion, taking all the cir\ncumstances into consideration, there is a manifest neces\nsity\u201d for doing so. Id., at 580. The decision to declare a\nmistrial is left to the \u201csound discretion\u201d of the judge, but\n\u201cthe power ought to be used with the greatest caution,\nunder urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvi\nous causes.\u201d Ibid.\n   Since Perez, we have clarified that the \u201cmanifest neces\nsity\u201d standard \u201ccannot be interpreted literally,\u201d and that a\nmistrial is appropriate when there is a \u201c \u2018high degree\u2019 \u201d of\nnecessity. Washington, supra, at 506. The decision\nwhether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the \u201cbroad dis\ncretion\u201d of the trial judge, a point that \u201chas been consis\ntently reiterated in decisions of this Court.\u201d Illinois v.\nSomerville, 410 U. S. 458, 462 (1973). See also Gori v.\nUnited States, 367 U. S. 364, 368 (1961).\n   In particular, \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a\nmistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is . . .\naccorded great deference by a reviewing court.\u201d Washing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Thedissent correctly points out that AEDPA itself \u201cnever uses the\nterm \u2018deference.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 19 (opinion of STEVENS, J.). But our cases\nhave done so over and over again to describe the effect of the threshold\nrestrictions in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) on granting federal habeas relief to\nstate prisoners.

A \u201cmistrial premised upon the trial\njudge\u2019s belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict [has\nbeen] long considered the classic basis for a proper mis\ntrial.\u201d Id., at 509; see also Downum v. United States, 372\nU. S. 734, 736 (1963) (deadlocked jury is the \u201cclassic ex\nample\u201d of when the State may try the same defendant\ntwice).\n   The reasons for \u201callowing the trial judge to exercise\nbroad discretion\u201d are \u201cespecially compelling\u201d in cases\ninvolving a potentially deadlocked jury. Washington, 434\nU. S., at 509. There, the justification for deference is that\n\u201cthe trial court is in the best position to assess all the\nfactors which must be considered in making a necessarily\ndiscretionary determination whether the jury will be able\nto reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.\u201d Id., at\n510, n. 28. In the absence of such deference, trial judges\nmight otherwise \u201cemploy coercive means to break the\napparent deadlock,\u201d thereby creating a \u201csignificant risk\nthat a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the\nsituation rather than the considered judgment of all the\njurors.\u201d Id., at 510, 509.\n   This is not to say that we grant absolute deference to\ntrial judges in this context. Perez itself noted that the\njudge\u2019s exercise of discretion must be \u201csound,\u201d 9 Wheat., at\n580, and we have made clear that \u201c[i]f the record reveals\nthat the trial judge has failed to exercise the \u2018sound discre\ntion\u2019 entrusted to him, the reason for such deference by an\nappellate court disappears.\u201d Washington, 434 U. S., at\n510, n. 28. Thus \u201cif the trial judge acts for reasons com\npletely unrelated to the trial problem which purports to be\nthe basis for the mistrial ruling, close appellate scrutiny is\nappropriate.\u201d Ibid. Similarly, \u201cif a trial judge acts irra\ntionally or irresponsibly, . . . his action cannot be con\ndoned.\u201d Id., at 514 (citing United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S.\n470 (1971), and Somerville, supra, at 469).\n   We have expressly declined to require the \u201cmechanical\n8                      RENICO v. LETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\napplication\u201d of any \u201crigid formula\u201d when trial judges de\ncide whether jury deadlock warrants a mistrial. Wade v.\nHunter, 336 U. S. 684, 691, 690 (1949). We have also\nexplicitly held that a trial judge declaring a mistrial is not\nrequired to make explicit findings of \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d\nnor to \u201carticulate on the record all the factors which in\nformed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.\u201d Washing\nton, supra, at 517. And we have never required a trial\njudge, before declaring a mistrial based on jury deadlock,\nto force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of\ntime, to question the jurors individually, to consult with\n(or obtain the consent of) either the prosecutor or defense\ncounsel, to issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to\nconsider any other means of breaking the impasse. In\n1981, then-Justice Rehnquist noted that this Court had\nnever \u201coverturned a trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial\nafter a jury was unable to reach a verdict on the ground\nthat the \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 standard had not been met.\u201d\nWinston v. Moore, 452 U. S. 944, 947 (opinion dissenting\nfrom denial of certiorari). The same remains true today,\nnearly 30 years later.\n   The legal standard applied by the Michigan Supreme\nCourt in this case was whether there was an abuse of the\n\u201cbroad discretion\u201d reserved to the trial judge. Somerville,\nsupra, at 462; Washington, supra, at 509. This type of\ngeneral standard triggers another consideration under\nAEDPA. When assessing whether a state court\u2019s applica\ntion of federal law is unreasonable, \u201cthe range of reason\nable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the\nrelevant rule\u201d that the state court must apply.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op.,\nat 11).\n                              III\n   In light of all the foregoing, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in this case was not unreasonable under\nAEDPA, and the decision of the Court of Appeals to grant\nLett a writ of habeas corpus must be reversed.\n   The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s adjudication involved a\nstraightforward application of our longstanding prece\ndents to the facts of Lett\u2019s case. The court cited our own\ndouble jeopardy cases\u2014from Perez to Washington\u2014\nelaborating upon the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d standard for\ngranting a mistrial and noting the broad deference that\nappellate courts must give trial judges in deciding whether\nthat standard has been met in any given case. Lett, 466\nMich., at 216\u2013222, 644 N. W. 2d, at 749\u2013752. It then\napplied those precedents to the particular facts before it\nand found no abuse of discretion, especially in light of the\nlength of deliberations after a short and uncomplicated\ntrial, the jury notes suggesting heated discussions and\nasking what would happen \u201cif we can\u2019t agree,\u201d and\u2014\n\u201c[m]ost important\u201d\u2014\u201cthe fact that the jury foreperson\nexpressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a\nverdict.\u201d Id., at 223, 644 N. W. 2d, at 753. In these cir\ncumstances, it was reasonable for the Michigan Supreme\nCourt to determine that the trial judge had exercised\nsound discretion in declaring a mistrial.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded\notherwise. It did not contest the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s description of the objective facts, but disagreed\nwith the inferences to be drawn from them. For example,\nit speculated that the trial judge may have misinterpreted\nthe jury\u2019s notes as signs of discord and deadlock when,\nread literally, they expressly stated no such thing. 316\n10                         RENICO v. LETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFed. Appx., at 427. It further determined that the judge\u2019s\nbrief colloquy with the foreperson may have wrongly\nimplied a false equivalence between \u201cmere disagreement\u201d\nand \u201cgenuine deadlock,\u201d and may have given rise to \u201cinap\npropriate pressure\u201d on her to say that the jury would be\nunable to reach a verdict. Id., at 426\u2013427. The trial\njudge\u2019s mistakes were so egregious, in the Court of Ap\npeals\u2019 view, that the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\nfinding no abuse of discretion was not only wrong but\nobjectively unreasonable. Id., at 427.\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of the trial record\nis not implausible. Nor, for that matter, is the more in\nventive (surely not \u201ccrude\u201d) speculation of the dissent.\nPost, at 10. After all, the jury only deliberated for four\nhours, its notes were arguably ambiguous, the trial judge\u2019s\ninitial question to the foreperson was imprecise, and the\njudge neither asked for elaboration of the foreperson\u2019s\nanswers nor took any other measures to confirm the fore\nperson\u2019s prediction that a unanimous verdict would not be\nreached.2\n   But other reasonable interpretations of the record are\nalso possible. Lett\u2019s trial was not complex, and there is no\nreason that the jury would necessarily have needed more\nthan a few hours to deliberate over his guilt. The notes\nthe jury sent to the judge certainly could be read as re\nflecting substantial disagreement, even if they did not say\nso outright. Most important, the foreperson expressly told\nthe judge\u2014in response to her unambiguous question \u201cAre\nyou going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?\u201d\u2014that the\njury would be unable to agree. Lett, supra, at 210, 644\nN. W. 2d, at 745.\n   Given the foregoing facts, the Michigan Supreme\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We do not think it reasonable, however, to contend that \u201cthe fore\n\nperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood of deadlock.\u201d\nPost, at 12.

Yarborough, 541 U. S., at 664; see\nalso Knowles, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Court of\nAppeals\u2019 ruling in Lett\u2019s favor failed to grant the Michigan\ncourts the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA\nand our double jeopardy precedents.\n   The Court of Appeals also erred in a second respect. It\nrelied upon its own decision in Fulton v. Moore, 520 F. 3d\n522 (CA6 2008), for the proposition \u201cthat Arizona v. Wash\nington sets forth three factors that determine whether a\njudge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mis\ntrial: whether the judge (1) heard the opinions of the\nparties\u2019 counsel about the propriety of the mistrial; (2)\nconsidered the alternatives to a mistrial; and (3) acted\ndeliberately, instead of abruptly.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx., at 426.\nIt then cited Fulton\u2019s interpretation of Washington to\nbuttress its conclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court\nerred in concluding that the trial judge had exercised\nsound discretion. 316 Fed. Appx., at 428.\n   The Fulton decision, however, does not constitute\n\u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 It is not necessary for us to decide whether the Michigan Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s decision\u2014or, for that matter, the trial judge\u2019s declaration of a\nmistrial\u2014was right or wrong. The latter question, in particular, is a\nclose one. As Lett points out, at a hearing before the Michigan Court of\nAppeals, the state prosecutor expressed the view that the judge had in\nfact erred in dismissing the jury and declaring a mistrial. The Michi\ngan Supreme Court declined to accept this confession of error, People v.\nLett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">939</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 N. W. 2d 855 (2000), and in any event\u2014for the\nreasons we have explained\u2014whether the trial judge was right or wrong\nis not the pertinent question under AEDPA.\n12                      RENICO v. LETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSupreme Court,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), so any failure to apply that\ndecision cannot independently authorize habeas relief\nunder AEDPA. Nor, as the dissent suggests, can Fulton\nbe understood merely to \u201cilluminat[e]\u201d Washington. Post,\nat 18. Washington nowhere established these three fac\ntors as a constitutional test that \u201cdetermine[s]\u201d whether a\ntrial judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a\nmistrial. 316 Fed. Appx., at 426.\n   In concluding that Lett is not entitled to a writ of ha\nbeas corpus, we do not deny that the trial judge could have\nbeen more thorough before declaring a mistrial. As the\nCourt of Appeals pointed out, id., at 427\u2013428, she could\nhave asked the foreperson additional followup questions,\ngranted additional time for further deliberations, or con\nsulted with the prosecutor and defense counsel before\nacting. Any of these steps would have been appropriate\nunder the circumstances. None, however, was required\u2014\neither under our double jeopardy precedents or, by exten\nsion, under AEDPA.\n                         *     *    *\n  AEDPA prevents defendants\u2014and federal courts\u2014from\nusing federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to second\nguess the reasonable decisions of state courts. Whether or\nnot the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s opinion reinstating\nLett\u2019s conviction in this case was correct, it was clearly not\nunreasonable. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

Yet what this history\ndemonstrates\u2014and what has not changed\u2014is the respect\nowed \u201ca defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial com\npleted by a particular tribunal.\u201d Wade v.

United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187\u2013188\n(1957).9\n   We have come over the years to recognize that jury\ncoercion poses a serious threat to jurors and defendants\nalike, and that the accused\u2019s interest in a single proceed\ning must sometimes yield \u201cto the public\u2019s interest in fair\ntrials designed to end in just judgments,\u201d Wade, 336 U. S.,\nat 689; and we have therefore carved out exceptions to the\ncommon-law rule. But the exceptions are narrow. For a\nmistrial to be granted at the prosecutor\u2019s request, \u201cthe\nprosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the\nmistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His\nburden is a heavy one.\u201d Washington, 434 U. S., at 505. A\njudge who acts sua sponte in declaring a mistrial must\nsimilarly make sure, and must enable a reviewing court to\nconfirm, that there is a \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d to deprive\nthe defendant of his valued right. Ibid.\n   In this case, the trial judge did not meet that burden.\nThe record suggests that she discharged the jury without\nconsidering any less extreme courses of action, and the\nrecord makes quite clear that she did not fully appreciate\nthe scope or significance of the ancient right at stake. The\nMichigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting Reginald\nLett\u2019s double jeopardy claim was just as clearly in error.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 As Justice Harlan observed, \u201c[a] power in government to subject the\n\nindividual to repeated prosecutions for the same offense would cut\ndeeply into the framework of procedural protections which the Consti\ntution establishes for the conduct of a criminal trial.\u201d United States v.\nJorn, 400 U.

The Court estab\nlished the authority of trial judges to discharge the jury\nprior to verdict, but in recognition of the novelty and\npotential injustice of the practice, the Court subjected that\nauthority to several constraints: The judge may not de\nclare a mistrial unless \u201cthere is a manifest necessity for\nthe act\u201d or \u201cthe ends of public justice\u201d so require; and in\ndetermining whether such conditions exist, the judge must\nexercise \u201csound discretion,\u201d \u201cconscientious[ness],\u201d and \u201cthe\ngreatest caution,\u201d reserving the discharge power for \u201cur\ngent circumstances\u201d and \u201cvery plain and obvious causes.\u201d\nIbid. What exact circumstances and causes would meet\nthat bar, the Court declined to specify. Recognizing that\ntrial proceedings may raise innumerable complications, so\nthat \u201cit is impossible to define\u201d in advance all of the possi\nble grounds for \u201cinterfere[nce],\u201d the Court set forth general\nstandards for judicial conduct rather than categorical\nrules for specific classes of situations.

Most were inconsequential, routine queries. The\nfirst note on Friday morning raised \u201c \u2018a concern about [the\njurors\u2019] voice levels,\u2019 \u201d Letter from M. McCowan to Clerk of\nCourt (Mar. 4, 2010), p. 2, but nothing in the record re\nlates this concern to the substance or tenor of their discus\nsion. At 12:27 p.m., the jury sent the fateful missive,\nasking: \u201c \u2018What if we can\u2019t agree? [M]istrial? [R]etrial?\n[W]hat?\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Seconds later, still at 12:27 p.m., the jury\nsent another note: \u201c \u2018What about lunch?\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n   At 12:45 p.m., the trial judge initiated a colloquy with\nthe foreperson that concluded in the mistrial declaration.\nSee ante, at 2\u20133 (reproducing transcript of colloquy). Even\naccounting for the imprecision of oral communication, the\njudge made an inordinate number of logical and legal\nmissteps during this short exchange. Cf. Somerville, 410\nU. S., at 469 (critiquing \u201cerratic\u201d mistrial inquiry). It does\nnot take much exegetical skill to spot them.\n   The judge began by stating: \u201c \u2018I received your note ask\ning me what if you can\u2019t agree? And I have to conclude\nfrom that that that is your situation at this time.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 2. This \u201c \u2018conclu[sion]\u2019 \u201d was a non sequitur. The note\nasked what would happen if the jury could not agree; it\ngave no indication that the jury had already reached an\nirrevocable impasse. The judge ignored the request for\ninformation that the note actually contained. Instead, she\nannounced that deadlock was the jury\u2019s \u201c \u2018situation at this\ntime,\u2019 \u201d thereby prejudging the question she had ostensibly\nsummoned the foreperson to probe: namely, whether the\njury was in fact deadlocked.\n    The judge continued: \u201c \u2018I need to ask you if the jury is\ndeadlocked; in other words, is there a disagreement as to\nthe verdict?\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 2\u20133. As the Federal Court of Ap\npeals observed, this question \u201cimproperly conflated dead\nlock with mere disagreement.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx. 421, 426\n(CA6 2009). Deadlock is a \u201ccondition or situation in which\nit is impossible to proceed or act; a complete standstill.\u201d 4\n10                    RENICO v. LETT\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nOxford English Dictionary 290 (2d ed. 1989). Disagree\nment among jurors is perfectly normal and does not come\nclose to approaching the \u201cimperious necessity\u201d we have\nrequired for their discharge. Downum, 372 U. S., at 736.\n   The trial judge then modulated her inquiry: \u201c \u2018Do you\nbelieve [the jury] is hopelessly deadlocked?\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 3.\nThe foreperson was in the midst of replying, \u201c \u2018The major\nity of us don\u2019t believe that\u2014,\u2019 \u201d when the judge appears to\nhave cut her off. Ibid. One cannot \u201cfault the trial judge\u201d\nfor wanting \u201cto preserve the secrecy of jury deliberations,\u201d\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787, but two aspects of the foreperson\u2019s\ntruncated reply are notable. First, it \u201ctends to show that\nthe foreperson did not feel prepared to declare definitively\nthat the jury was hopelessly deadlocked.\u201d Ibid. If she had\nbeen so prepared, then it is hard to see why she would\nbegin her response with a descriptive account of the \u201c \u2018ma\njority\u2019 \u201d viewpoint.\n   Second, the foreperson\u2019s reply suggests the jury may\nhave been leaning toward acquittal. Admittedly, this is\ncrude speculation, but it is entirely possible that the fore\nperson was in the process of saying, \u201cThe majority of us\ndon\u2019t believe that he\u2019s guilty.\u201d Or: \u201cThe majority of us\ndon\u2019t believe that there is sufficient evidence to prove one\nof the counts.\u201d (On retrial, Lett was convicted on both\ncounts.) These possibilities are, I submit, linguistically\nmore probable than something like the following: \u201cThe\nmajority of us don\u2019t believe that Lett is guilty, whereas a\nminority of us believe that he is\u2014and we are hopelessly\ndeadlocked on the matter.\u201d And they are logically far more\nprobable than something along the lines of, \u201cThe majority\nof us don\u2019t believe that we will ever be able to reach a\nverdict,\u201d as the foreperson had been given no opportunity\nto poll her colleagues on this point. Yet only such implau\nsible endings could have supported a conclusion that it\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

After the foreperson\nhesitated, the judge persisted: \u201c \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The\nforeperson replied: \u201c \u2018No, Judge.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Two aspects of\nthis interchange are also notable. First, the judge\u2019s ques\ntion, though \u201cvery direct,\u201d was \u201cactually rather ambigu\nous,\u201d because it gave the foreperson no temporal or legal\ncontext within which to understand what was being asked.\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787. \u201cThe foreperson could have easily\nthought the judge meant, \u2018Are you going to reach a\nunanimous verdict in the next hour?\u2019 or \u2018before the lunch\nrecess?\u2019 or \u2018by the end of the day?\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (emphasis de\nleted). Even if the foreperson assumed no time constraint,\nshe could have easily thought the judge meant, \u201cAre you,\nin your estimation, more likely than not to reach a unani\nmous verdict?\u201d An affirmative answer to that question\nwould likewise fall far short of manifest necessity.\n   Second, the foreperson\u2019s hesitation suggests a lack of\nconfidence in her position. That alone ought to have called\ninto question the propriety of a mistrial order. But the\njudge bore down and demanded an unqualified answer,\n\u201c \u2018Yes or no.\u2019 \u201d Most of the time when we worry about\njudicial coercion of juries, we worry about judges pressur\ning them, in the common-law manner, to keep deliberating\nuntil they return a verdict they may not otherwise have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 Another reading of the foreperson\u2019s reply is available: Her state\n\nment,\u201c \u2018The majority of us don\u2019t believe that,\u2019 \u201d may have been a com\nplete sentence. In other words, she may have meant to convey, \u201cThe\nmajority of us don\u2019t believe that we are hopelessly deadlocked.\u201d The\ntrial-court transcript places an em dash rather than a period after the\nword \u201cthat,\u201d but this is hardly dispositive evidence of intonation or\nintent. However, the trial judge\u2019s contemporaneous reaction, the fact\nthat the foreperson was not permitted to consult with the other jurors\non the issue of deadlock, and respondent\u2019s failure to advance this\nreading undercut its plausibility.\n12                    RENICO v. LETT\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nchosen. This judge exerted pressure so as to prevent the\njury from reaching any verdict at all. In so doing, she cut\noff deliberations well before the point when it was clear\nthey would no longer be fruitful. Recall that prior to\nsummoning the foreperson for their colloquy, the trial\njudge gave her no opportunity to consult with the other\njurors on the matter that would be discussed. So, the\nforeperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood\nof deadlock. Recall, as well, that almost immediately after\nsending the judge a note asking what would happen if\nthey disagreed, the jury sent a note asking about lunch.\nPlainly, this was a group that was prepared to go on with\nits work.\n   The judge then declared a mistrial on the spot. Her\nentire exchange with the foreperson took three minutes,\nfrom 12:45 p.m. to 12:48 p.m. App. to Pet. for Cert. 93a\u2013\n94a. The entire jury deliberations took roughly four\nhours. The judge gave the parties no opportunity to com\nment on the foreperson\u2019s remarks, much less on the ques\ntion of mistrial. Cf. Washington, 434 U. S., at 515\u2013516\n(trial judge \u201cgave both defense counsel and the prosecutor\nfull opportunity to explain their positions on the propriety\nof a mistrial\u201d); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 26.3 (\u201cBefore order\ning a mistrial, the court must give each defendant and the\ngovernment an opportunity to comment on the propriety of\nthe order, to state whether that party consents or objects,\nand to suggest alternatives\u201d).

For example, the judge did\nnot poll the jurors, give an instruction ordering further\ndeliberations, query defense counsel about his thoughts on\ncontinued deliberations, or indicate on the record why a\nmistrial declaration was necessary.\u201d Lett, 466 Mich., at\n227\u2013228, 644 N. W. 2d, at 755 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).\nNor did the judge invite any argument or input from the\nprosecutor, make any findings of fact or provide any\nstatements illuminating her thought process, follow up on\nthe foreperson\u2019s final response, or give any evident consid\neration to the ends of public justice or the balance between\nthe defendant\u2019s rights and the State\u2019s interests.

W. 2d 743, 754 (2002) (trial court did not \u201carticulate a rationale on\nthe record\u201d). The Michigan Supreme Court expressly declined to\ncommit to the position that the jury really was deadlocked or that\nmanifest necessity really did exist. See, e.g., id., at 220, 644 N. W. 2d,\nat 751 (\u201cThe issue is not whether this Court would have found manifest\nnecessity\u201d). Accordingly, even if 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(e)(1) were to apply to\nthis appeal, there were no \u201cdetermination[s] of a factual issue made by\na State court\u201d that we would have to \u201cpresum[e] to be correct.\u201d In any\nevent, none of the relevant facts in the case are disputed, and no\nargument concerning \u00a72254(e)(1) was properly raised in this Court or\npassed upon below.\n16                          RENICO v. LETT\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthough it would have been preferable if Lett had tried to\nlodge an objection, defense counsel was given no meaning\nful opportunity to do so\u2014the judge discharged the jury\nsimultaneously with her mistrial order, counsel received\nno advance notice of either action, and he may not even\nhave been informed of the content of the jury\u2019s notes. See\nante, at 2; 316 Fed. Appx., at 428 (\u201cAt no point before the\nactual declaration of the mistrial was it even mentioned\non the record as a potential course of action by the court.\nThe summary nature of the trial court\u2019s actions . . . ren\ndered an objection both unlikely and meaningless\u201d (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted)). Counsel\u2019s failure to object\nis therefore legally irrelevant.17 And, as detailed above,\nthe foreperson\u2019s remarks were far more equivocal and\nambiguous, in context, than the Michigan Supreme Court\nallowed.\n   The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s defense of the trial\ncourt\u2019s actions is thus weak on its own terms. It collapses\nentirely under the weight of the many defects in the trial\ncourt\u2019s process, virtually all of which the court either\noverlooked or discounted.\n   The unreasonableness of the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision is highlighted by the decisions of the three other\ncourts that have addressed Lett\u2019s double jeopardy claim,\neach of which ruled in his favor, as well as the dissent\nfiled by two Michigan Supreme Court Justices and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  17 See Jorn, 400 U.

While a defendant\u2019s affirmative\nrequest for or consent to a mistrial may be relevant to the double\njeopardy inquiry, see, e.g., Jorn, 400 U. S., at 485 (plurality opinion), we\nhave never suggested that defendants must object to such orders to\npreserve a claim, much less object to an order issued sua sponte and\nwithout any advance notice.\n                    Cite as: 559 U.

This Court\u2019s deci\nsion unfortunately compounds the deleterious conse\nquences of the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. \u201cAl\nthough the trial judge\u2019s decision is entitled to great\ndeference, it is not the place of a reviewing court to extract\nfactoids from the record in an attempt to salvage a bad\ndecision.\u201d 507 F. Supp. 2d, at 787.\n                             III\n   The Court does not really try to vindicate the Michigan\nSupreme Court on the merits, but instead ascribes today\u2019s\noutcome to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA). The foregoing analysis shows why\nthe Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s ruling cannot be saved by\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), however construed. That ruling\nwas not only incorrect but also unreasonable by any fair\nmeasure. Three particular facets of the Court\u2019s AEDPA\nanalysis require a brief comment.\n   First, the fact that the substantive legal standard ap\nplied by the state court \u201cis a general one\u201d has no bearing\non the standard of review. Ante, at 11. We have said that\n\u201c[t]he more general the rule, the more leeway courts have\nin reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d\nYarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004). But\nthis statement stands only for the unremarkable proposi\ntion that more broadly framed rules will tend to encom\npass a broader set of conforming applications. Regardless\nof the nature of the legal principle at issue, the task of a\nfederal court remains the same under \u00a72254(d)(1): to\ndetermine whether the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary\nto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law.\u201d General standards are no less\nbinding law than discrete rules.18\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 In recognition of this basic insight, our precedents \u201chave made\n\nclear\u201d that a state-court decision may be \u201cunreasonable\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a72254(d)(1) when the \u201cstate court has misapplied a \u2018govern\n18                          RENICO v. LETT\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   Second, I do not agree that the Federal Court of Appeals\n\u201cerred\u201d by \u201crel[ying] upon its own decision\u201d applying Ari\nzona v. Washington. Ante, at 11. The Sixth Circuit was\nwell aware that its own decision \u201cdoes not constitute\n\u2018clearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 11\u201312 (quoting \u00a72254(d)(1)).\nThe panel expressly stated that it \u201creview[ed] the Michi\ngan Supreme Court\u2019s decision to determine only whether\nit was objectively unreasonable in light of the holdings of\nthe Supreme Court.\u201d 316 Fed. Appx., at 425. The panel\nexamined its own precedents not as the relevant \u201cclearly\nestablished Federal law\u201d under AEDPA, but as a tool for\nilluminating the precise contours of that law. Lower\ncourts routinely look to circuit cases to \u201cprovide evidence\nthat Supreme Court precedents ha[ve] clearly established\na rule as of a particular time or [to] shed light on the\n\u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the state courts\u2019 application of existing\nSupreme Court precedents.\u201d 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman,\nFederal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure \u00a732.3,\np. 1585, n. 10 (5th ed. 2005) (hereinafter Hertz & Lieb\nman). This is a healthy practice\u2014indeed, a vital practice,\nconsidering how few cases this Court decides\u2014and we\nhave never disapproved it.\n   Finally, I do not agree that AEDPA authorizes \u201cthe dual\nlayers of deference\u201d the Court has utilized in this case.\nAnte, at 11. There is little doubt that AEDPA \u201cdirects\nfederal courts to attend to every state-court judgment with\nutmost care.\u201d Williams, 529 U. S., at 389 (opinion of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ning legal principle\u2019 to \u2018a set of facts different from those of the case in\nwhich the principle was announced.\u2019 \u201d Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,\n520 (2003) (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 76 (2003)); see\nalso Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 413 (2000). This is a critical\nfeature of our AEDPA jurisprudence. Federal habeas review would be\nmeaningless if, for relief to be granted, we required a perfect congru\nence between the facts that gave rise to our governing precedents and\nthe facts that confronted the state court in any particular case.\n                 Cite as: 559 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nSTEVENS, J.). But the statute never uses the term \u201cdefer\nence,\u201d and the legislative history makes clear that Con\ngress meant to preserve robust federal-court review. Id.,\nat 386\u2013387; see also Hertz & Liebman \u00a732.3, at 1587\u2013\n1589, n. 13 (summarizing congressional record and noting\nthat \u201c[t]he aspect of prior practice that most troubled\nAEDPA\u2019s supporters was the federal court\u2019s inattention to,\nand lack of respect for, state court decisions that the fed\neral court, if it only looked, would find to be legally cor\nrect\u201d). Any attempt to prevent federal courts from exercis\ning independent review of habeas applications would have\nbeen a radical reform of dubious constitutionality, and\nCongress \u201cwould have spoken with much greater clarity\u201d if\nthat had been its intent. Williams, 529 U. S., at 379 (opin\nion of STEVENS, J.).\n  So on two levels, it is absolutely \u201cnecessary for us to\ndecide whether the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision . . .\nwas right or wrong.\u201d Ante, at 11, n. 3. If a federal judge\nwere firmly convinced that such a decision were wrong,\nthen in my view not only would he have no statutory duty\nto uphold it, but he might also have a constitutional obli\ngation to reverse it. And regardless of how one conceptu\nalizes the distinction between an incorrect and an \u201cunrea\nsonable\u201d state-court ruling under \u00a72254(d)(1), one must\nalways determine whether the ruling was wrong to be able\nto test the magnitude of any error. Substantive and meth\nodological considerations compel federal courts to give\nhabeas claims a full, independent review\u2014and then to\ndecide for themselves. Even under AEDPA, there is no\nescaping the burden of judgment.\n                       *    *     *\n  In this case, Reginald Lett\u2019s constitutional rights were\nviolated when the trial court terminated his first trial\nwithout adequate justification and he was subsequently\nprosecuted for the same offense.

LETT\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nappear to dispute this point, but it nevertheless denies\nLett relief by applying a level of deference to the state\ncourt\u2019s ruling that effectively effaces the role of the federal\ncourts. Nothing one will find in the United States Code or\nthe United States Reports requires us to turn a blind eye\nto this manifestly unlawful conviction.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
