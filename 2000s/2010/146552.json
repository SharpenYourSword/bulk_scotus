Argued January 12, 2010\u2014Decided May 17, 2010\nFederal law allows a district court to order the civil commitment of a\n  mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date he\n  would otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248. The Government in\n  stituted civil-commitment proceedings under \u00a74248 against respon\n  dents, each of whom moved to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that,\n  in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its powers under the Nec\n  essary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Agreeing,\n  the District Court granted dismissal, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed\n  on the legislative-power ground.\nHeld: The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress authority suf\n ficient to enact \u00a74248. Taken together, five considerations compel\n this conclusion. Pp. 5\u201322.\n    (1) The Clause grants Congress broad authority to pass laws in fur\n therance of its constitutionally enumerated powers. It makes clear\n that grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied\n by broad power to enact laws that are \u201cconvenient, or useful\u201d or \u201ccon\n ducive\u201d to the enumerated power\u2019s \u201cbeneficial exercise,\u201d e.g.,\n McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 413, 418, and that Congress\n can \u201clegislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be\n involved in the constitution,\u201d id., at 421. In determining whether the\n Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be \u201cmeans\n ends rationality\u201d between the enacted statute and the source of fed\n eral power. Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605. The Constitu\n tion \u201caddresse[s]\u201d the \u201cchoice of means\u201d \u201cprimarily . . . to the judg\n ment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really\n calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent\n to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship be\n tween the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    congressional determination alone.\u201d Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547\u2013548. Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants\n    Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifi\n    cally enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to\n    provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the secu\n    rity of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the\n    federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority\n    to do each of those things under the Clause. Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (2) Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental\n    health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil\n    commitment. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity De\n    fense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74241\u20134247. A longstanding\n    history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute\u2019s con\n    stitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New York, 397\n    U. S. 664, 678, but can be \u201chelpful in reviewing the substance of a\n    congressional statutory scheme,\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 21,\n    and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the\n    new statute and pre-existing federal interests. Section 4248 differs\n    from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due\n    to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Many of these individu\n    als, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under\n    \u00a74246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention\n    of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\n    thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). The similarities\n    between \u00a74246 and \u00a74248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest\n    addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework. Pp. 9\u201314.\n       (3) There are sound reasons for \u00a74248\u2019s enactment. The Federal\n    Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional\n    power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from\n    the danger such prisoners may pose. Moreover, \u00a74248 is \u201creasonably\n    adapted\u201d to Congress\u2019 power to act as a responsible federal custodian.\n    United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 121. Congress could have rea\n    sonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental ill\n    ness that causes them to \u201chave serious difficulty in refraining from\n    sexually violent conduct,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(6), would pose an especially high\n    danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have rea\n    sonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals\n    would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal\n    custody. Congress\u2019 desire to address these specific challenges, taken\n    together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the\n    conclusion that \u00a74248 satisfies \u201creview for means-end rationality,\u201d\n    Sabri, supra, at 605. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (4) Respondents\u2019 contention that \u00a74248 violates the Tenth Amend\n    ment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  typically left to state control is rejected. That Amendment does not\n  \u201creserve to the States\u201d those powers that are \u201cdelegated to the United\n  States by the Constitution,\u201d including the powers delegated by the\n  Necessary and Proper Clause. See, e.g., New York v. United States,\n  505 U. S. 144, 159. And \u00a74248 does not \u201cinvade\u201d state sovereignty,\n  but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other\n  things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the\n  federal prisoner \u201cis domiciled or was tried\u201d of his detention, \u00a74248(d),\n  and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority\n  over the individual, which will prompt the individual\u2019s immediate\n  transfer to State custody, \u00a74248(d)(1). In Greenwood v. United\n  States, 350 U. S. 366, 375\u2013376, the Court rejected a similar challenge\n  to \u00a74248\u2019s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above. Because\n  the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of\n  state interests than \u00a74248, a fortiori, the current statute does not in\n  vade state interests. Pp. 16\u201318.\n    (5) Section 4248 is narrow in scope. The Court rejects respondents\u2019\n  argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and\n  Proper Clause, Congress\u2019 authority can be no more than one step re\n  moved from a specifically enumerated power. See, e.g., McCulloch,\n  supra, at 417. Nor will the Court\u2019s holding today confer on Congress\n  a general \u201cpolice power, which the Founders denied the National\n  Government and reposed in the States.\u201d United States v. Morrison,\n  529 U. S. 598, 618. Section \u00a74248 has been applied to only a small\n  fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals al\n  ready \u201cin the custody of the\u201d Federal Government, \u00a74248(a). Thus,\n  far from a \u201cgeneral police power,\u201d \u00a74248 is a reasonably adapted and\n  narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government\u2019s legitimate in\n  terest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its\n  prison system. See New York, supra, at 157. Pp. 18\u201322.\n    The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its\n  application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due\n  process, or any other constitutional rights. Respondents are free to\n  pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.\n  P. 22.\n551 F. 3d 274, reversed and remanded.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

GRAYDON \n\n           EARL COMSTOCK, JR., ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [May 17, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A federal civil-commitment statute authorizes the De\npartment of Justice to detain a mentally ill, sexually\ndangerous federal prisoner beyond the date the prisoner\nwould otherwise be released. 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248. We have\npreviously examined similar statutes enacted under state\nlaw to determine whether they violate the Due Process\nClause. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 356\u2013358\n(1997); Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407 (2002). But this\ncase presents a different question. Here we ask whether\nthe Federal Government has the authority under Article I\nof the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment\nprogram or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a\ngovernment \u201cof enumerated powers.\u201d McCulloch v. Mary\nland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819). We conclude that the\nConstitution grants Congress the authority to enact \u00a74248\nas \u201cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\u201d the\npowers \u201cvested by\u201d the \u201cConstitution in the Government of\nthe United States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18.\n                            I\n  The federal statute before us allows a district court to\n2              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder the civil commitment of an individual who is cur\nrently \u201cin the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,\u201d\n\u00a74248, if that individual (1) has previously \u201cengaged or\nattempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,\u201d (2) currently \u201csuffers from a serious mental\nillness, abnormality, or disorder,\u201d and (3) \u201cas a result of\u201d\nthat mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is \u201csexually\ndangerous to others,\u201d in that \u201che would have serious diffi\nculty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation if released.\u201d \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5)\u2013(6).\n   In order to detain such a person, the Government (act\ning through the Department of Justice) must certify to a\nfederal district judge that the prisoner meets the condi\ntions just described, i.e., that he has engaged in sexually\nviolent activity or child molestation in the past and that\nhe suffers from a mental illness that makes him corre\nspondingly dangerous to others. \u00a74248(a). When such a\ncertification is filed, the statute automatically stays the\nindividual\u2019s release from prison, ibid., thereby giving the\nGovernment an opportunity to prove its claims at a hear\ning through psychiatric (or other) evidence, \u00a7\u00a74247(b)\u2013(c),\n4248(b). The statute provides that the prisoner \u201cshall be\nrepresented by counsel\u201d and shall have \u201can opportunity\u201d at\nthe hearing \u201cto testify, to present evidence, to subpoena\nwitnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross\nexamine\u201d the Government\u2019s witnesses. \u00a7\u00a74247(d), 4248(c).\n   If the Government proves its claims by \u201cclear and con\nvincing evidence,\u201d the court will order the prisoner\u2019s con\ntinued commitment in \u201cthe custody of the Attorney Gen\neral,\u201d who must \u201cmake all reasonable efforts to cause\u201d the\nState where that person was tried, or the State where he\nis domiciled, to \u201cassume responsibility for his custody,\ncare, and treatment.\u201d \u00a74248(d); cf. Sullivan v. Freeman,\n944 F. 2d 334, 337 (CA7 1991). If either State is willing to\nassume that responsibility, the Attorney General \u201cshall\nrelease\u201d the individual \u201cto the appropriate official\u201d of that\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But if, \u201cnotwithstanding such efforts,\nneither such State will assume such responsibility,\u201d then\n\u201cthe Attorney General shall place the person for treatment\nin a suitable [federal] facility.\u201d Ibid.; cf. \u00a74247(i)(A).\n   Confinement in the federal facility will last until either\n(1) the person\u2019s mental condition improves to the point\nwhere he is no longer dangerous (with or without appro\npriate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be re\nleased; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his cus\ntody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be\ntransferred to the custody of that State. \u00a7\u00a74248(d)(1)\u2013(2).\nThe statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric\nand judicial review of the individual\u2019s case, including\njudicial hearings at the request of the confined person at\nsix-month intervals. \u00a7\u00a74247(e)(1)(B), (h).\n   In November and December 2006, the Government\ninstituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the\nEastern District of North Carolina against the five re\nspondents in this case. Three of the five had previously\npleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child por\nnography, see 507 F. Supp. 2d 522, 526, and n. 2 (2007);\n\u00a72252A(a), and the fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual\nabuse of a minor, see United States v. Vigil, No.\n1:99CR00509\u2013001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); \u00a7\u00a71153, 2243(a).\nWith respect to each of them, the Government claimed\nthat the respondent was about to be released from federal\nprison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or\nchild molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a\nmental illness that made him sexually dangerous to oth\ners. App. 38\u201340, 44\u201352. During that same time period,\nthe Government instituted similar proceedings against the\nfifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court\nwith aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found\nmentally incompetent to stand trial. See id., at 41\u201343;\nUnited States v. Catron, No. 04\u2013778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27,\n2006); \u00a74241(d).\n4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil\ncommitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They\nclaimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, crimi\nnal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nand the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. 507 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 528. They claimed that the statute denies them sub\nstantive due process and equal protection of the laws.\nIbid. They claimed that it violates their procedural due\nprocess rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous\nness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead\nof by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid. And, finally,\nthey claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex\nceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, \u00a78 of the Consti\ntution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause\nand the Necessary and Proper Clause. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at\n528\u2013529.\n   The District Court, accepting two of the respondents\u2019\nclaims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with\nrespondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, id., at 551\u2013559 (citing In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358 (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the\nstatute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers,\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530\u2013551. On appeal, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on\nthis latter, legislative-power ground. 551 F. 3d 274, 278\u2013\n284 (2009). It did not decide the standard-of-proof ques\ntion, nor did it address any of respondents\u2019 other constitu\ntional challenges. Id., at 276, n. 1.\n   The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its\nrequest, limited to the question of Congress\u2019 authority\nunder Art. I, \u00a78 of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since\nthen, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that\nsame question, each deciding it in the Government\u2019s favor,\nthereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.\nSee United States v. Volungus, 595 F. 3d 1 (CA1 2010);\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States v. Tom, 565 F. 3d 497 (CA8 2009).\n                               II\n   The question presented is whether the Necessary and\nProper Clause, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18, grants Congress authority\nsufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that\nquestion, we assume, but we do not decide, that other\nprovisions of the Constitution\u2014such as the Due Process\nClause\u2014do not prohibit civil commitment in these circum\nstances. Cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346; Addington v. Texas,\n441 U. S. 418 (1979). In other words, we assume for ar\ngument\u2019s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit\na State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether\nthe Federal Government, exercising its enumerated pow\ners, may enact such a statute as well. On that assump\ntion, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress\nlegislative power sufficient to enact \u00a74248. We base this\nconclusion on five considerations, taken together.\n   First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress\nbroad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200\nyears ago, this Court stated that the Federal \u201c[G]overn\nment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated\npowers,\u201d McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 405, which means that\n\u201c[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or\nmore of\u201d those powers, United States v. Morrison, 529\nU. S. 598, 607 (2000). But, at the same time, \u201ca govern\nment, entrusted with such\u201d powers \u201cmust also be en\ntrusted with ample means for their execution.\u201d\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 408. Accordingly, the Necessary\nand Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution\u2019s\ngrants of specific federal legislative authority are accom\npanied by broad power to enact laws that are \u201cconvenient,\nor useful\u201d or \u201cconducive\u201d to the authority\u2019s \u201cbeneficial\nexercise.\u201d Id., at 413, 418; see also id., at 421 (\u201c[Congress\ncan] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which\nmust be involved in the constitution . . .\u201d). Chief Justice\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMarshall emphasized that the word \u201cnecessary\u201d does not\nmean \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d Id., at 413\u2013415 (emphasis\ndeleted); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462\n(2003) (\u201c[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress\nbe \u2018 \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d \u2019 to the exercise of an enumer\nated power\u201d). In language that has come to define the\nscope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:\n    \u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n    constitution, are constitutional.\u201d McCulloch, supra, at\n    421.\n   We have since made clear that, in determining whether\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the\nlegislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,\nwe look to see whether the statute constitutes a means\nthat is rationally related to the implementation of a con\nstitutionally enumerated power.

But as we have already stated, the present\nstatute\u2019s validity under provisions of the Constitution\nother than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue\nthat is not before us. Under the question presented, the\nrelevant inquiry is simply \u201cwhether the means chosen are\n\u2018reasonably adapted\u2019 to the attainment of a legitimate end\nunder the commerce power\u201d or under other powers that\nthe Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple\nment. Gonzales, supra, at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment) (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100,\n121 (1941)).\n   We have also recognized that the Constitution \u201cad\ndresse[s]\u201d the \u201cchoice of means\u201d\n    \u201cprimarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can\n    be seen that the means adopted are really calculated\n    to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the ex\n    tent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of\n    the relationship between the means adopted and the\n    end to be attained, are matters for congressional de\n    termination alone.\u201d Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547\u2013548 (1934).\nSee also Lottery Case, 188 U.

And Congress routinely exercises its authority to\nenact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its\nenumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign\ncommerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the\ngeneral welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish\npost offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturali\nzation, and so forth.

See, e.g., \u00a71791 (prohibit\ning smuggling contraband); \u00a7751 et seq. (prohibiting es\ncape and abetting thereof); 28 CFR \u00a7541.10 et seq. (2009)\n(inmate discipline).\n   Neither Congress\u2019 power to criminalize conduct, nor its\npower to imprison individuals who engage in that conduct,\nnor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prison\ners, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Con\ngress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of\nthose things in the course of \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d the\nenumerated powers \u201cvested by\u201d the \u201cConstitution in the\nGovernment of the United States,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18\u2014\nauthority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n   Second, the civil-commitment statute before us consti\ntutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related\nmental-health statutes that have existed for many dec\nades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of\nrelated federal action does not demonstrate a statute\u2019s\nconstitutionality. See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of City of\nNew York, 397 U. S. 664, 678 (1970) (\u201c[N]o one acquires a\nvested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by\nlong use . . .\u201d); cf. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 612\u2013614 (legisla\ntive history is neither necessary nor sufficient with respect\nto Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can\nnonetheless be \u201chelpful in reviewing the substance of a\ncongressional statutory scheme,\u201d Gonzales, 545 U. S., at\n21; Walz, supra, at 678, and, in particular, the reason\nableness of the relation between the new statute and pre\nexisting federal interests.\n   Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of\n10              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmental health care to federal prisoners, and has long\nprovided for their civil commitment. In 1855 it estab\nlished Saint Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital in the District of Colum\nbia to provide treatment to \u201cthe insane of the army and\nnavy . . . and of the District of Columbia.\u201d Act of Mar. 3,\n1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857 it provided for\nconfinement at Saint Elizabeth\u2019s of any person within the\nDistrict of Columbia who had been \u201ccharged with [a]\ncrime\u201d and who was \u201cinsane\u201d or later became \u201cinsane\nduring the continuance of his or her sentence in the\nUnited States penitentiary.\u201d Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \u00a7\u00a75\u20136, 11\nStat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212\u2013213 (1881). In\n1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes,\nCongress provided for civil commitment in federal facili\nties (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of \u201call per\nsons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in\nany court of the United States\u201d and who are or \u201cshall\nbecome\u201d insane \u201cduring the term of their imprisonment.\u201d\nAct of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis\nadded). And in 1882 Congress provided for similar com\nmitment of those \u201ccharged\u201d with federal offenses who\nbecome \u201cinsane\u201d while in the \u201ccustody\u201d of the United\nStates. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis\nadded). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress\ncreated a national, federal civil-commitment program\nunder which any person who was either charged with or\nconvicted of any federal offense in any federal court could\nbe confined in a federal mental institution.\n   These statutes did not raise the question presented\nhere, for they all provided that commitment in a federal\nhospital would end upon the completion of the relevant\n\u201cterms\u201d of federal \u201cimprisonment\u201d as set forth in the un\nderlying criminal sentence or statute. \u00a7\u00a72\u20133, 18 Stat. 252;\nsee 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen.\n569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940\u2019s that proviso was\neliminated.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States\nproposed legislative reforms of the federal civil\ncommitment system. The Judicial Conference based its\nproposals upon what this Court has described as a \u201clong\nstudy by a conspicuously able committee\u201d (chaired by\nJudge Calvert Magruder and whose members included\nJudge Learned Hand), involving consultation \u201cwith federal\ndistrict and circuit judges\u201d across the country as well as\nwith the Department of Justice. Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366, 373 (1956); Greenwood v. United\nStates, 219 F. 2d 376, 380\u2013384 (CA8 1955) (describing the\ncommittee\u2019s work). The committee studied, among other\nthings, the \u201cserious problem faced by the Bureau of Pris\nons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the\nexpiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be\ndangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no\nstate will assume responsibility for their custody.\u201d Judi\ncial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment\nAccorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged\nwith Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report),\nApp. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in\nwhich the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the prob\nlem of \u201c \u2018paranoid\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018threatening\u2019 \u201d individuals whom\nno State would accept. Id., at 9, App. 71. And it noted\nthat, in the Bureau\u2019s \u201c[e]xperience,\u201d States would not\naccept an \u201cappreciable number\u201d of \u201cmental[ly] incompe\ntent\u201d individuals \u201cnearing expiration\u201d of their prison\nterms, because of their \u201clack of legal residence in any\nState,\u201d even though those individuals \u201cought not . . . be at\nlarge because they constitute a menace to public safety.\u201d\nH. R. Rep. No. 1319, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1949) (state\nment of James V. Bennett, Director); see also Letter from\nBennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee\nReport, App. 83\u201388. The committee, hence the Judicial\nConference, therefore recommended that Congress enact\n\u201csome provision of law authorizing the continued confine\n12               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nment of such persons after their sentences expired.\u201d\nCommittee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the\nJudicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).\n  Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the\nJudicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.\nSee Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74241\u2013\n4243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74244\u20134248. It provided for the civil commit\nment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally\nincompetent at any time after their arrest and before the\nexpiration of their federal sentence, \u00a7\u00a74241, 4244, 4247\u2013\n4248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards,\n\u00a7\u00a74242, 4246, 4247. With respect to an individual whose\nprison term is about to expire, it specified the following:\n        \u201cWhenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons\n     shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to\n     expire has been examined [and] . . . in the judgment of\n     the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner\n     is insane or mentally incompetent, and . . . if released\n     he will probably endanger the safety of the officers,\n     the property, or other interests of the United States,\n     and that suitable arrangements for the custody and\n     care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the\n     Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to . . .\n     the court for the district in which the prisoner is con\n     fined. Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner\n     to be examined . . . and shall . . . hold a hearing . . . . If\n     upon such hearing the court shall determine that the\n     conditions specified above exist, the court may commit\n     the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or\n     his authorized representative.\u201d \u00a74247.\nThe precondition that the mentally ill individual\u2019s release\nwould \u201cprobably endanger the safety of the officers, the\nproperty, or other interests of the United States\u201d was\nuniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201crelease would endanger the safety of persons, property or\nthe public interest in general\u2014not merely the interests\npeculiar to the United States as such.\u201d United States v.\nCurry, 410 F. 2d 1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also Royal v.\nUnited States, 274 F. 2d 846, 851\u2013852 (CA10 1960).\n  In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See\nInsanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74241\u20134247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it\naltered the provision just discussed, regarding the pris\noner\u2019s danger to the \u201cinterests of the United States,\u201d to\nconform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpre\ntation of that language, i.e., it altered the language so as\nto authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to\nthe other conditions, the prisoner\u2019s \u201crelease would create a\nsubstantial risk of bodily injury to another person or\nserious damage to the property of another.\u201d \u00a74246(d).\n  Congress also elaborated upon the required condition\n\u201cthat suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise avail\nable\u201d by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative\nplacement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.\nSee ibid.; supra, at 2\u20133. With these modifications, the\nstatutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of\nindividuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once\nthey have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal\ncrime. \u00a7\u00a74241(d), 4246; see also \u00a74243(d). They continue\nto provide for the continued civil commitment of those\nindividuals when they are \u201cdue for release\u201d from federal\ncustody because their \u201csentence is about to expire.\u201d \u00a74246.\nAnd, as we have previously set forth, they establish vari\nous procedural and other requirements. E.g., \u00a74247.\n  In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before\nus. \u00a7302, 120 Stat. 619, 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248. It differs from\nearlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons\nwho, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.\nNotably, many of these individuals were likely already\nsubject to civil commitment under \u00a74246, which, since\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal\nprisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\nthereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But\ncf. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013218, pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from\nits specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, \u00a74248 is\nsimilar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. \u00a74246.\nIn that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding\nfederal statutory framework, which has been in place\nsince 1855.\n   Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding\ncivil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually\ndangerous persons who are already in federal custody,\neven if doing so detains them beyond the termination of\ntheir criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Gov\nernment is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus\ntodian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to\nprotect nearby (and other) communities from the danger\nfederal prisoners may pose. Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\nU. S. 307, 320 (1982) (\u201cIn operating an institution such as\n[a prison system], there are occasions in which it is neces\nsary for the State to restrain the movement of residents\u2014\nfor example, to protect them as well as others from vio\nlence\u201d (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one\n\u201cwho takes charge of a third person\u201d is \u201cunder a duty to\nexercise reasonable care to control\u201d that person to prevent\nhim from causing reasonably foreseeable \u201cbodily harm to\nothers.\u201d    Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7319, p. 129\n(1963\u20131964); see Volungus, 595 F. 3d, at 7\u20138 (citing cases);\nsee also United States v. S. A., 129 F. 3d 995, 999 (CA8\n1997) (\u201c[Congress enacted \u00a74246] to avert the public dan\nger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and\ndangerous detainees\u201d). If a federal prisoner is infected\nwith a communicable disease that threatens others, surely\nit would be \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d for the Federal Gov\nernment to take action, pursuant to its role as federal\ncustodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes)\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto release that individual among the general public, where\nhe might infect others (even if not threatening an inter\nstate epidemic, cf. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3). And if confinement of\nsuch an individual is a \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d thing to do,\nthen how could it not be similarly \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d\nto confine an individual whose mental illness threatens\nothers to the same degree?\n   Moreover, \u00a74248 is \u201creasonably adapted,\u201d Darby, 312\nU. S., at 121, to Congress\u2019 power to act as a responsible\nfederal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal\ncriminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement\nconstitutionally enumerated authority, see supra, at 7\u20138).\nCongress could have reasonably concluded that federal\ninmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them\nto \u201chave serious difficulty in refraining from sexually\nviolent conduct,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(6), would pose an especially\nhigh danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013218, at 22\u201323. And Congress could also have rea\nsonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference\u2019s\nreport) that a reasonable number of such individuals\nwould likely not be detained by the States if released from\nfederal custody, in part because the Federal Government\nitself severed their claim to \u201clegal residence in any State\u201d\nby incarcerating them in remote federal prisons.

Here\nCongress\u2019 desire to address the specific challenges identi\nfied in the Reports cited above, taken together with its\nresponsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the con\nclusion that \u00a74248 satisfies \u201creview for means-end ration\nality,\u201d i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution\u2019s insistence\nthat a federal statute represent a rational means for im\nplementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.\nSabri, 541 U.

S. 715,\n736 (1972) (\u201cThe States have traditionally exercised broad\npower to commit persons found to be mentally ill\u201d). But\nthe Tenth Amendment\u2019s text is clear: \u201cThe powers not\ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States\nrespectively, or to the people.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The\npowers \u201cdelegated to the United States by the Constitu\ntion\u201d include those specifically enumerated powers listed\nin Article I along with the implementation authority\ngranted by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Virtually by\ndefinition, these powers are not powers that the Constitu\ntion \u201creserved to the States.\u201d See New York, supra, at 156,\n159 (\u201c[I]f a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitu\ntion, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any res\nervation of that power to the States . . . .\u201d \u201cIn the end . . .\nit makes no difference whether one views the question at\nissue in these cases as one of ascertaining the limits of the\npower delegated to the Federal Government under the\naffirmative provisions of the Constitution or one of dis\ncerning the core of sovereignty retained by the States\nunder the Tenth Amendment\u201d); Darby, supra, at 123\u2013124;\nsee also Hodel, 452 U.

To\nthe contrary, it requires accommodation of state interests:\nThe Attorney General must inform the State in which the\nfederal prisoner \u201cis domiciled or was tried\u201d that he is\ndetaining someone with respect to whom those States may\nwish to assert their authority, and he must encourage\nthose States to assume custody of the individual.\n\u00a74248(d). He must also immediately \u201crelease\u201d that person\n\u201cto the appropriate official of\u201d either State \u201cif such State\nwill assume [such] responsibility.\u201d Ibid. And either State\nhas the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the\nindividual, which will prompt the individual\u2019s immediate\ntransfer to State custody. \u00a74248(d)(1). Respondents con\ntend that the States are nonetheless \u201cpowerless to prevent\nthe detention of their citizens under \u00a74248, even if deten\ntion is contrary to the States\u2019 policy choices.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nmost natural reading of the statute, see \u00a7\u00a74248(d)(1)\u2013(e),\nand the Solicitor General acknowledges that \u201cthe Federal\nGovernment would have no appropriate role\u201d with respect\nto an individual covered by the statute once \u201cthe transfer\nto State responsibility and State control has occurred.\u201d Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 9.\n   In Greenwood, 350 U. S. 366, the Court rejected a chal\nlenge to the current statute\u2019s predecessor\u2014i.e., to the 1949\nstatute we described above, supra, at 11\u201312. The petition\ners in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that\nthe statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in Greenwood v. United States,\nO. T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18\u201329. But the Court rejected\nthat argument. See Greenwood, supra, at 375\u2013376. And\nthe version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less\nprotective of state interests than the current statute. That\nstatute authorized federal custody so long as \u201csuitable\narrangements\u201d were \u201cnot otherwise available\u201d in a State or\notherwise. 63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for\n18              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner in Greenwood, supra, at 25 (\u201cWhat has really\nhappened is that the Federal government has been dissat\nisfied with the care given by the states to those mentally\nincompetent who have been released by the Federal au\nthorities\u201d). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, \u00a74248\nrequires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant\nStates to take custody of the individual without inquiring\ninto the \u201csuitability\u201d of their intended care or treatment,\nand to relinquish federal authority whenever a State\nasserts its own. \u00a74248(d). Thus, if the statute at issue in\nGreenwood did not invade state interests, then, a fortiori,\nneither does \u00a74248.\n   Fifth, the links between \u00a74248 and an enumerated\nArticle I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the\nstatutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the\ncautionary instruction that we may not \u201cpile inference\nupon inference\u201d in order to sustain congressional action\nunder Article I, Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, respondents\nargue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary\nand Proper Clause, Congress\u2019 authority can be no more\nthan one step removed from a specifically enumerated\npower. See Brief for Respondents 21\u201322; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n27\u201328. But this argument is irreconcilable with our prece\ndents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that\ncase we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of\na mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac\ncused of robbing a United States Post Office. 350 U. S., at\n369, 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was\nthe power to \u201cEstablish Post Offices and Post Roads.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 7. But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized\nin McCulloch,\n     \u201cthe power \u2018to establish post offices and post roads\u2019\n     . . . is executed by the single act of making the estab\n     lishment. . . . [F]rom this has been inferred the power\n     and duty of carrying the mail along the post road,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    from one post office to another.          And, from\n    this implied power, has again been inferred the right\n    to punish those who steal letters from the post office,\n    or rob the mail.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 417 (emphasis added).\nAnd, as we have explained, from the implied power to\npunish we have further inferred both the power to im\nprison, see supra, at 8\u20139, and, in Greenwood, the federal\ncivil-commitment power.\n   Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multi\nple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in Sabri\nwe observed that \u201cCongress has authority under the\nSpending Clause to appropriate federal moneys\u201d and that\nit therefore \u201chas corresponding authority under the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars\u201d\nare not \u201csiphoned off\u201d by \u201ccorrupt public officers.\u201d 541\nU. S., at 605 (citation omitted). We then further held that,\nin aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of \u201ctax\npayer dollars,\u201d Congress has the additional prophylactic\npower to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the\nstolen funds have not been \u201ctraceably skimmed from\nspecific federal payments.\u201d Ibid. Similarly, in United\nStates v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343 (1879), we held that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in\nfurtherance of Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 11\u201313, to award \u201cpensions to\nthe wounded and disabled\u201d soldiers of the armed forces\nand their dependents, 98 U. S. at 351; and from that im\nplied power we further inferred the \u201c[i]mplied power\u201d \u201cto\npass laws to . . . punish\u201d anyone who fraudulently appro\npriated such pensions, id., at 346. See also Stewart v.\nKahn, 11 Wall. 493, 506\u2013507 (1871).\n   Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress\nhas the implied power to criminalize any conduct that\nmight interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power,\nand also the additional power to imprison people who\nviolate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the\n20              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional power to provide for the safe and reasonable\nmanagement of those prisons, and the additional power to\nregulate the prisoners\u2019 behavior even after their release.\nSee post, at 12\u201313, 17, n. 11. Of course, each of those\npowers, like the powers addressed in Sabri, Hall, and\nMcCulloch, is ultimately \u201cderived from\u201d an enumerated\npower, Hall, supra, at 345. And, as the dissent agrees,\nthat enumerated power is \u201cthe enumerated power that\njustifies the defendant\u2019s statute of conviction,\u201d post, at 17,\nn. 11. Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single\nspecific enumerated power \u201cthat justifies a criminal de\nfendant\u2019s arrest or conviction,\u201d post, at 12, in all cases\nbecause Congress relies on different enumerated powers\n(often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause power) to\nenact its various federal criminal statutes, see supra, at 7\u2013\n8. But every such statute must itself be legitimately\npredicated on an enumerated power. And the same enu\nmerated power that justifies the creation of a federal\ncriminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied\nfederal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justi\nfies civil commitment under \u00a74248 as well. See supra, at\n14\u201316. Thus, we must reject respondents\u2019 argument that\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a\nsingle step between an enumerated power and an Act of\nCongress.\n   Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on\nCongress a general \u201cpolice power, which the Founders\ndenied the National Government and reposed in the\nStates.\u201d Morrison, 529 U. S., at 618. As the Solicitor\nGeneral repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, \u00a74248 is\nnarrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small frac\ntion of federal prisoners. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24\u201325 (105\nindividuals have been subject to \u00a74248 out of over 188,000\nfederal inmates); see also Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\nJustice Statistics, W. Sabol, H.

Taken together, these considera\ntions lead us to conclude that the statute is a \u201cnecessary\nand proper\u201d means of exercising the federal authority that\npermits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to pun\nish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appro\npriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security\nof those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected\nby the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution\nconsequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.\n   We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or\nits application denies equal protection of the laws, proce\ndural or substantive due process, or any other rights\nguaranteed by the Constitution.

S. C. \u00a74248 are necessary and\nproper exercises of congressional authority.\n   Respondents argue that congressional authority under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause can be no more than one\nstep removed from an enumerated power. This is incor\nrect. When the inquiry is whether a federal law has suffi\ncient links to an enumerated power to be within the scope\nof federal authority, the analysis depends not on the num\nber of links in the congressional-power chain but on the\nstrength of the chain.\n   Concluding that a relation can be put into a verbal\nformulation that fits somewhere along a causal chain of\nfederal powers is merely the beginning, not the end, of the\nconstitutional inquiry. See United States v. Lopez, 514\nU. S. 549, 566\u2013567 (1995). The inferences must be con\ntrolled by some limitations lest, as Thomas Jefferson\nwarned, congressional powers become completely un\nbounded by linking one power to another ad infinitum in a\nveritable game of \u201c \u2018this is the house that Jack built.\u2019 \u201d\nLetter from Thomas Jefferson to Edward Livingston (Apr.\n30, 1800), 31 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 547 (B.\nOberg ed. 2004); see also United States v.

The first is\nto withhold assent from certain statements and proposi\ntions of the Court\u2019s opinion. The second is to caution that\nthe Constitution does require the invalidation of congres\nsional attempts to extend federal powers in some\ninstances.\n                               I\n   The Court concludes that, when determining whether\nCongress has the authority to enact a specific law under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause, we look \u201cto see whether\nthe statute constitutes a means that is rationally related\nto the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated\npower.\u201d Ante, at 6 (suggesting that Sabri v. United States,\n541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004), adopts a \u201cmeans-ends rational\nity\u201d test).\n   The terms \u201crationally related\u201d and \u201crational basis\u201d must\nbe employed with care, particularly if either is to be used\nas a stand-alone test. The phrase \u201crational basis\u201d most\noften is employed to describe the standard for determining\nwhether legislation that does not proscribe fundamental\nliberties nonetheless violates the Due Process Clause.\nReferring to this due process inquiry, and in what must be\none of the most deferential formulations of the standard\nfor reviewing legislation in all the Court\u2019s precedents, the\nCourt has said: \u201cBut the law need not be in every respect\nlogically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is\nenough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and\nthat it might be thought that the particular legislative\nmeasure was a rational way to correct it.\u201d Williamson v.\nLee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487\u2013488 (1955).\nThis formulation was in a case presenting a due process\nchallenge and a challenge to a State\u2019s exercise of its own\npowers, powers not confined by the principles that control\nthe limited nature of our National Government. The\nphrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\nissue before us.\n    The operative constitutional provision in this case is the\nNecessary and Proper Clause. This Court has not held\nthat the Lee Optical test, asking if \u201cit might be thought\nthat the particular legislative measure was a rational way\nto correct\u201d an evil, is the proper test in this context.\nRather, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, applica\ntion of a \u201crational basis\u201d test should be at least as exacting\nas it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more\nso. Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its\nopinion referring to \u201crational basis\u201d are predominantly\nCommerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases.\nSee ante, at 6 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005);\nLopez, supra; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recla\nmation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981)).\n    There is an important difference between the two ques\ntions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear.\nRaich, Lopez, and Hodel were all Commerce Clause cases.\nThose precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not\na mere conceivable rational relation, as in Lee Optical.\n\u201c \u2018[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particu\nlar activity substantially affects interstate commerce does\nnot necessarily make it so.\u2019 \u201d Lopez, supra, at 557, n. 2\n(quoting Hodel, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in\njudgment)). The rational basis referred to in the Com\nmerce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based\non empirical demonstration. While undoubtedly deferen\ntial, this may well be different from the rational-basis test\nas Lee Optical described it.\n    The Court relies on Sabri, supra, for its conclusion that\na \u201cmeans-ends rationality\u201d is all that is required for a\npower to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause\u2019s\nreach. See ante, at 6. Sabri only refers to \u201cmeans-ends\nrationality\u201d in a parenthetical describing the holding in\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819); it certainly\ndid not import the Lee Optical rational-basis test into this\n4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\narena through such a parenthetical. See Sabri, supra, at\n612 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cA statute can\nhave a \u2018rational\u2019 connection to an enumerated power with\nout being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated\npower\u201d). It should be remembered, moreover, that the\nspending power is not designated as such in the Constitu\ntion but rather is implied from the power to lay and collect\ntaxes and other specified exactions in order, among other\npurposes, \u201cto pay the Debts and provide for the common\nDefence and general Welfare of the United States.\u201d Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 1; see South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206\n(1987). The limits upon the spending power have not been\nmuch discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to\nthe Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the ana\nlytic approach in those precedents should be respected.\n   A separate concern stems from the Court\u2019s explanation\nof the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 16. I had thought it a\nbasic principle that the powers reserved to the States\nconsist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remain\ning after taking account of powers granted to the National\nGovernment. The Constitution delegates limited powers\nto the National Government and then reserves the re\nmainder for the States (or the people), not the other way\naround, as the Court\u2019s analysis suggests. And the powers\nreserved to the States are so broad that they remain unde\nfined. Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps\nimperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and\nthe States alone.\n   It is correct in one sense to say that if the National\nGovernment has the power to act under the Necessary and\nProper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the\nStates. But the precepts of federalism embodied in the\nConstitution inform which powers are properly exercised\nby the National Government in the first place. See Lopez,\n514 U. S., at 580\u2013581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also\nMcCulloch, supra, at 421 (powers \u201cconsist[ent] with the\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

It\nis of fundamental importance to consider whether essen\ntial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the\nassertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper\nClause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is\nnot one properly within the reach of federal power.\n   The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to\nhold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on\nthe exercise of congressional power are the Constitution\u2019s\nexpress prohibitions. The Court\u2019s discussion of the Tenth\nAmendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing\nfrom the federal system are of no import when defining\nthe limits of the National Government\u2019s power, as it pro\nceeds by first asking whether the power is within the\nNational Government\u2019s reach, and if so it discards federal\nism concerns entirely.\n   These remarks explain why the Court ignores important\nlimitations stemming from federalism principles. Those\nprinciples are essential to an understanding of the func\ntion and province of the States in our constitutional\nstructure.\n                              II\n   As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted\nwithin its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the\nfederal detention of prisoners does not endanger third\nparties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State\nto take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so\nit is incumbent on the National Government to act. This\nobligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in\ntort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an\nunstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.\nHaving acted within its constitutional authority to detain\nthe person, the National Government can acknowledge a\nduty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does\nnot prejudice the States and their citizens.\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   I would note, as the Court\u2019s opinion does, that \u00a74248\ndoes not supersede the right and responsibility of the\nStates to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil\nconfinement. The federal program in question applies\nonly to those in federal custody and thus involves little\nintrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the\nStates.\n   This is not a case in which the National Government\ndemands that a State use its own governmental system to\nimplement federal commands. See Printz v. United States,\n521 U. S. 898 (1997). It is not a case in which the Na\ntional Government relieves the States of their own pri\nmary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the\nsafety and well being of their citizens. See United States\nv. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Nor is it a case in which\nthe exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and\nduties traditionally committed to the State. See Lopez,\nsupra, at 580\u2013581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of author\nity over a small class of persons already subject to the\nfederal power. Importantly, \u00a74248(d) requires the Attor\nney General to release any civil detainee \u201cto the appropri\nate official of the State in which the person is domiciled or\nwas tried if such State will assume responsibility for his\ncustody, care, and treatment,\u201d providing a strong assur\nance that the proffered reason for the legislation\u2019s neces\nsity is not a mere artifice.\n   With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the\nCourt.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a74248, in order to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d\npowers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitu\ntion, see Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18.\n   Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from\nfederal prisoners who suffer from \u201ca serious mental ill\nness, abnormality, or disorder\u201d and who, if released, would\nhave \u201cserious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent\nconduct or child molestation.\u201d        See \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5), (6),\n4248(d). Under this law, if neither the State of a pris\noner\u2019s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was\ntried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner\u2019s\n\u201ccustody, care, and treatment,\u201d the Federal Government is\nauthorized to undertake that responsibility. \u00a74248(d).\nThe statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will\nassume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a\ndangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy\nfederal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to\nany State.\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  I entirely agree with the dissent that \u201c[t]he Necessary\nand Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those\nlaws that \u2018carr[y] into Execution\u2019 one or more of the federal\npowers enumerated in the Constitution,\u201d post, at 1, but\n\u00a74248 satisfies that requirement because it is a necessary\nand proper means of carrying into execution the enumer\nated powers that support the federal criminal statutes\nunder which the affected prisoners were convicted. The\nNecessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional\nauthority for most federal criminal statutes. In other\nwords, most federal criminal statutes rest upon a congres\nsional judgment that, in order to execute one or more of\nthe powers conferred on Congress, it is necessary and\nproper to criminalize certain conduct, and in order to do\nthat it is obviously necessary and proper to provide for the\noperation of a federal criminal justice system and a federal\nprison system.\n  All of this has been recognized since the beginning of\nour country. The First Congress enacted federal criminal\nlaws,1 created federal law enforcement and prosecutorial\npositions,2 established a federal court system,3 provided\nfor the imprisonment of persons convicted of federal\ncrimes,4 and gave United States marshals the responsibil\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 See, e.g., ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112 (\u201cAn Act for the Punishment of certain\nCrimes against the United States\u201d).\n   2 Ch. 20, \u00a735, id., at 92 (\u201c[T]here shall be appointed in each district a\n\nmeet person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States\nin such district, . . . whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district\nall delinquents for crimes and offences, cognizable under the authority\nof the United States\u201d).\n   3 \u00a71, id., at 73 (\u201cAn Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United\n\nStates\u201d).\n   4 See, e.g., \u00a79, id., at 76\u201377 (providing that the federal district courts\n\nshall have exclusive jurisdiction over \u201call crimes and offences that shall\nbe cognizable under the authority of the United States, . . . where no\nother punishment than whipping, not exceeding thirty stripes, a fine\nnot exceeding one hundred dollars, or a term of imprisonment not\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

United States, 350 U. S. 366,\n373\u2013374 (1956). These federal prisoners, having been held\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nexceeding six months, is to be inflicted\u201d); see also J. Roberts, The\nFederal Bureau of Prisons: Its Mission, Its History, and Its Partnership\nWith Probation and Pretrial Services, 61 Fed. Probation 53 (1997)\n(explaining that federal prisoners were originally housed in state and\ncounty facilities on a contract basis).\n  5 See ch. 20, \u00a727, 1 Stat. 87 (\u201c[A] marshal shall be appointed in and\n\nfor each district for the term of four years, . . . whose duty it shall be to\nattend the district and circuit courts when sitting therein, . . .

COMSTOCK\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfor years in a federal prison, often had few ties to any\nState; it was a matter of speculation where they would\nchoose to go upon release; and accordingly no State was\nenthusiastic about volunteering to shoulder the burden of\ncivil commitment.\n  The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Con\ngress carte blanche. Although the term \u201cnecessary\u201d does\nnot mean \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d or indispensable, the\nterm requires an \u201cappropriate\u201d link between a power\nconferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by\nCongress. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415\n(1819). And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce\ncompliance with that limitation. Id., at 423.\n  The law in question here satisfies that requirement.\nThis is not a case in which it is merely possible for a court\nto think of a rational basis on which Congress might have\nperceived an attenuated link between the powers underly\ning the federal criminal statutes and the challenged civil\ncommitment provision. Here, there is a substantial link to\nCongress\u2019 constitutional powers.\n  For this reason, I concur in the judgment that Congress\nhad the constitutional authority to enact 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a74248.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a74248(a). I disagree. The Necessary and Proper\nClause empowers Congress to enact only those laws that\n\u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d one or more of the federal powers\nenumerated in the Constitution. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Because\n\u00a74248 \u201cExecut[es]\u201d no enumerated power, I must respect\nfully dissent.\n                             I\n   \u201cAs every schoolchild learns, our Constitution estab\nlishes a system of dual sovereignty between the States and\nthe Federal Government.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.\n452, 457 (1991). In our system, the Federal Government\u2019s\npowers are enumerated, and hence limited. See, e.g.,\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819) (\u201cThis\ngovernment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumer\nated powers\u201d). Thus, Congress has no power to act unless\nthe Constitution authorizes it to do so. United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U. S. 598, 607 (2000) (\u201cEvery law enacted\n2                 UNITED STATES v.

The States, in turn, are\nfree to exercise all powers that the Constitution does not\nwithhold from them. Amdt. 10 (\u201cThe powers not delegated\nto the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by\nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or\nto the people\u201d).1 This constitutional structure establishes\ndifferent default rules for Congress and the States: Con\ngress\u2019 powers are \u201cfew and defined,\u201d while those that\nbelong to the States \u201cremain . . . numerous and indefinite.\u201d\nThe Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).\n   The Constitution plainly sets forth the \u201cfew and defined\u201d\npowers that Congress may exercise. Article I \u201cvest[s]\u201d in\nCongress \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,\u201d \u00a71, and\ncarefully enumerates those powers in \u00a78. The final clause\nof \u00a78, the Necessary and Proper Clause, authorizes Con\ngress \u201c[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,\nand all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or\nOfficer thereof.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. As the Clause\u2019s place\nment at the end of \u00a78 indicates, the \u201cforegoing Powers\u201d are\nthose granted to Congress in the preceding clauses of that\nsection. The \u201cother Powers\u201d to which the Clause refers are\nthose \u201cvested\u201d in Congress and the other branches by\nother specific provisions of the Constitution.\n   Chief Justice Marshall famously summarized Congress\u2019\nauthority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in\nMcCulloch, which has stood for nearly 200 years as this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 \u201cWith this careful last phrase, the [Tenth] Amendment avoids tak\n\ning any position on the division of power between the state govern\nments and the people of the States: It is up to the people of each State\nto determine which \u2018reserved\u2019 powers their state government may\nexercise.\u201d U.

Second, there must be a\nnecessary and proper fit between the \u201cmeans\u201d (the federal\nlaw) and the \u201cend\u201d (the enumerated power or powers) it is\ndesigned to serve. Ibid. McCulloch accords Congress a\ncertain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit\nunder this second inquiry. The means Congress selects\nwill be deemed \u201cnecessary\u201d if they are \u201cappropriate\u201d and\n\u201cplainly adapted\u201d to the exercise of an enumerated power,\nand \u201cproper\u201d if they are not otherwise \u201cprohibited\u201d by the\nConstitution and not \u201c[in]consistent\u201d with its \u201cletter and\nspirit.\u201d Ibid.\n   Critically, however, McCulloch underscores the linear\nrelationship the Clause establishes between the two in\nquiries: Unless the end itself is \u201clegitimate,\u201d the fit be\ntween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no\nmatter how \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d an Act of Congress\nmay be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis\nlate if the objective is anything other than \u201ccarrying into\nExecution\u201d one or more of the Federal Government\u2019s enu\nmerated powers.

See, e.g., Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete\nAnti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist\nsupporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge,\nexplaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any\nfreestanding authority, but instead made explicit what\nwas already implicit in the grant of each enumerated\npower. Referring to the \u201cpowers declared in the Constitu\ntion,\u201d Alexander Hamilton noted that \u201cit is expressly to\nexecute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . author\nizes the national legislature to pass all necessary and\nproper laws.\u201d The Federalist No. 33, at 245.

S. 549, 563\u2013567 (1995).\nThat limitation forecloses any claim that \u00a74248 carries\ninto execution Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power, and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 The Act defines a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d as one \u201cwho has en\n\ngaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,\u201d and \u201cwho is sexually dangerous to others.\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5).\nIt further defines \u201csexually dangerous to others\u201d to mean a person who\n\u201csuffers from a serious mental illness\u201d such that he would \u201chave serious\ndifficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molesta\ntion if released.\u201d \u00a74247(a)(6).\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 426 (1979). As a conse\nquence, we have held that States may \u201ctake measures to\nrestrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill\u201d\u2014\nincluding those who are sexually dangerous\u2014provided\nthat such commitments satisfy due process and other\nconstitutional requirements. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521\nU. S. 346, 363 (1997).\n  Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil\ncommitment laws that States have enacted under their\nparens patriae and general police powers. Indeed, it is\nclear, on the face of the Act and in the Government\u2019s\narguments urging its constitutionality, that \u00a74248 is\naimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,\nnot toward \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d any enumerated\npower or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam\nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.\n587 (entitled \u201c[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual\nexploitation and violent crime\u201d), \u00a7102, id., at 590 (state\nment of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated\n\u201cto protect the public from sex offenders\u201d); Brief for United\nStates 38\u201339 (asserting the Federal Government\u2019s power\nto \u201cprotect the public from harm that might result upon\nthese prisoners\u2019 release, even when that harm might arise\nfrom conduct that is otherwise beyond the general regula\ntory powers of the federal government\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 For the reasons explained in Part III\u2013A\u20132, infra, the enumerated\n\npower that justifies a particular defendant\u2019s criminal arrest or convic\ntion cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under \u00a74248.\n8                  UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual of\nfenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a\ndespicable act with untold consequences for the victim\npersonally and society generally. See, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, (2008) (ALITO, J., dis\nsenting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2, 22\u201323). But the Constitution\ndoes not vest in Congress the authority to protect society\nfrom every bad act that might befall it.6 New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (\u201c \u2018The question is\nnot what power the Federal Government ought to have\nbut what powers in fact have been given by the people\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936)).\n  In my view, this should decide the question. Section\n4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress\u2019\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress\nmay act under that Clause only when its legislation\n\u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d one of the Federal Government\u2019s\nenumerated powers. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Section 4248 does\nnot execute any enumerated power. Section 4248 is there\nfore unconstitutional.\n                             III\n   The Court perfunctorily genuflects to McCulloch\u2019s\nframework for assessing Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper\nClause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty\nit helps to maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor\nof a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that\n\u00a74248 is a \u201c \u2018necessary and proper\u2019 \u201d adjunct to a jumble of\nunenumerated \u201cauthorit[ies].\u201d Ante, at 22.

It also raises more questions than it answers.\nMust each of the five considerations exist before the Court\nsustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of\nCongress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What\nif the facts of a given case support a finding of only four\nconsiderations? Or three? And if three or four will suffice,\nwhich three or four are imperative? At a minimum, this\nshift from the two-step McCulloch framework to this five\nconsideration approach warrants an explanation as to why\nMcCulloch is no longer good enough and which of the five\nconsiderations will bear the most weight in future cases,\nassuming some number less than five suffices. (Or, if not,\nwhy all five are required.) The Court provides no answers\nto these questions.\n                            A\n  I begin with the first and last \u201cconsiderations\u201d in the\nCourt\u2019s inquiry. Ante, at 5. The Court concludes that\n\u00a74248 is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 Necessary and\nProper Clause authority because that authority is \u201cbroad,\u201d\nibid., and because \u201cthe links between \u00a74248 and an enu\nmerated Article I power are not too attenuated,\u201d ante, at\n18. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies,\nMcCulloch\u2019s straightforward two-part test.\n                             1\n                             a\n  First, the Court describes Congress\u2019 lawmaking power\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause as \u201cbroad,\u201d relying\non precedents that have upheld federal laws under the\nClause after finding a \u201c \u2018rationa[l]\u2019 \u201d fit between the law\nand an enumerated power. Ante, at 6 (quoting Sabri v.\nUnited States, 541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)). It is true that\nthis Court\u2019s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of\nlatitude in selecting the means for \u201ccarrying into Execu\n10                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntion\u201d an end that is \u201clegitimate.\u201d7 See, e.g., Jinks v. Rich\nland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462\u2013463 (2003) (citing\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 417, 421). But in citing these\ncases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit\nbetween means and ends matters only if the end is in fact\nlegitimate\u2014i.e., only if it is one of the Federal Govern\nment\u2019s enumerated powers.\n   By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference\nowed to Congress in selecting means to further a legiti\nmate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch\u2019s first step and\nfails carefully to examine whether the end served by \u00a74248\nis actually one of those powers. See Part III\u2013A\u20132, infra.\n                             b\n  Second, instead of asking the simple question of what\nenumerated power \u00a74248 \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d at\nMcCulloch\u2019s first step, the Court surveys other laws Con\ngress has enacted and concludes that, because \u00a74248 is\nrelated to those laws, the \u201clinks\u201d between \u00a74248 and an\nenumerated power are not \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d; hence, \u00a74248\nis a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper\nClause authority. Ante, at 18. This unnecessarily con\nfuses the analysis and, if followed to its logical extreme,\nwould result in an unwarranted expansion of federal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE KENNEDY concludes that the Necessary and Proper Clause\nrequires something beyond rational-basis scrutiny when assessing the\nfit between an enumerated power and the means Congress selects to\nexecute it. Ante, at 2\u20134 (opinion concurring in judgment). Other\narguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have\nbeen lodged elsewhere. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 61\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an \u201c \u2018obvious, simple, and\ndirect relation\u2019 \u201d to an exercise of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers and\nmust not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty).\nBut I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the\nanalysis employed at McCulloch\u2019s second step, see McCulloch v. Mary\nland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), while the Court\u2019s decision today errs by\nskipping the first.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npower.\n   The Court observes that Congress has the undisputed\nauthority to \u201ccriminalize conduct\u201d that interferes with\nenumerated powers; to \u201cimprison individuals who engage\nin that conduct\u201d; to \u201cenact laws governing [those] prisons\u201d;\nand to serve as a \u201ccustodian of its prisoners.\u201d Ante, at 9,\n14. From this, the Court assumes that \u00a74248 must also be\na valid exercise of congressional power because it is \u201c \u2018rea\nsonably adapted\u2019 \u201d to those exercises of Congress\u2019 inciden\ntal\u2014and thus unenumerated\u2014authorities. See ante, at 15\n(concluding that \u201c\u00a74248 is \u2018reasonably adapted\u2019 to Con\ngress\u2019 power to act as a responsible federal custodian\u201d\n(citation omitted)); ante, at 22 (concluding that \u201cthe stat\nute is a \u2018necessary and proper\u2019 means of exercising the\nfederal authority that permits Congress to create federal\ncriminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison viola\ntors, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to\nmaintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but\nwho may be affected by the federal imprisonment of oth\ners\u201d). But that is not the question. The Necessary and\nProper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to\nenact any law simply because it furthers other laws Con\ngress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental author\nity; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every\nfederal statute \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d one or more of\nthe Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 McCulloch   makes this point clear. As the Court notes, ante, at 18\u2013\n19, McCulloch states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress\u2019\nenumerated power to establish post offices and post roads \u201chas been\ninferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,\u201d and, \u201cfrom this\nimplied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who\nsteal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 417.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest\nthat the relationship between Congress\u2019 implied power to punish postal\ncrimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to\nsatisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead,\nMcCulloch directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress\u2019\n12                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes\nwith enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who\nengage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and\ntreatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal\nsentence satisfy this test because each helps to \u201ccarr[y]\ninto Execution\u201d the enumerated powers that justify a\ncriminal defendant\u2019s arrest or conviction. For example,\nCongress\u2019 enumerated power \u201c[t]o establish Post Offices\nand post Roads,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 7, would lack force or practi\ncal effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact crimi\nnal laws \u201cto punish those who steal letters from the post\noffice, or rob the mail.\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 417. Simi\nlarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if\nthere were no prisons to hold persons who violate those\nlaws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that\nprisoners could escape or demand their release on the\ngrounds that the conditions of their confinement violate\ntheir constitutional rights, at least as we have defined\nthem. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nenumerated power \u201c \u2018to establish post offices and post roads.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(explaining that \u201cthe right to . . . punish those who rob [the mail] is not\nindispensably necessary to the establishment of a post office and post\nroad,\u201d but is \u201cessential to the beneficial exercise of th[at] power\u201d). More\nimportantly, McCulloch\u2019s holding, as well as the holdings of this Court\u2019s\nsubsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action is valid\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries into execution\none or more enumerated powers.

In other words, the Court analogizes\n\u00a74248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care\nfor federal inmates while they serve sentences or await\ntrial. But while those laws help to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d\nthe enumerated power that justifies the imposition of\ncriminal sanctions on the inmate, \u00a74248 does not bear that\nessential characteristic for three reasons.\n   First, the statute\u2019s definition of a \u201csexually dangerous\nperson\u201d contains no element relating to the subject\u2019s\ncrime. See \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5)\u2013(6). It thus does not require a\nfederal court to find any connection between the reasons\nsupporting civil commitment and the enumerated power\nwith which that person\u2019s criminal conduct interfered. As a\nconsequence, \u00a74248 allows a court to civilly commit an\nindividual without finding that he was ever charged with\nor convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence.\n\u00a7\u00a74248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely hypothetical:\nThe Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals\nagainst whom \u00a74248 proceedings have been brought fit\nthis description.9 Tr. of Oral Arg. 23\u201325.\n   Second, \u00a74248 permits the term of federal civil commit\nment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The statute does require the court to find that the subject \u201chas en\n\ngaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5), but that factual predicate can be established\nby a state conviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the\nperson committed a sex crime for which he was never charged.\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprisoner\u2019s sentence expires or the date on which the stat\nute of limitations on an untried defendant\u2019s crime has run.\nThe statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a\nperson at a time when the Government would lack juris\ndiction to detain him for violating a criminal law that\nexecutes an enumerated power.\n   The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366 (1956), provides a useful contrast.\nThat statute authorized the Federal Government to exer\ncise civil custody over a federal defendant declared men\ntally unfit to stand trial only \u201c \u2018until the accused shall be\nmentally competent to stand trial or until the pending\ncharges against him are disposed of according to law.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 368, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \u00a74246 (1952 ed.)).\nThus, that statute\u2019s \u201cend\u201d reasonably could be interpreted\nas preserving the Government\u2019s power to enforce a crimi\nnal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.),\nhowever, authorizes federal detention of a person even\nafter the Government loses the authority to prosecute him\nfor a federal crime.\n   Third, the definition of a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d\nrelevant to \u00a74248 does not require the court to find that\nthe person is likely to violate a law executing an enumer\nated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern\nment has no express power to regulate sexual violence\ngenerally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscrib\ning such conduct in special circumstances. All of these\nstatutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a\nconnection to one of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers\u2014such\nas interstate commerce, e.g., \u00a72252(a)(2)\u2014or that limit the\nstatute\u2019s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has\nplenary authority, e.g., \u00a72243(a). Section 4248, by con\ntrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that\nthe person is \u201csexually dangerous,\u201d and presents a risk \u201cto\nothers,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5).

Although the Necessary\nand Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact \u00a74248, I do not\nrule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the civil com\nmitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a result of acts\ncommitted in these jurisdictions. See, e.g., United States v. Cohen, 733\nF. 2d 128 (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil commitment of a\ndefendant under a District of Columbia statute authorizing the institu\ntionalization of persons acquitted by reason of insanity). Although two\nof the respondents in this case were either charged with or convicted of\ncriminal acts committed in such jurisdictions, see ante, at 3; 507\nF. Supp. 2d 522, 527, and n. 2 (EDNC 2007), that question is not\npresented here because \u00a74248 does not make that fact essential to an\nindividual\u2019s placement in civil detention.\n16                UNITED STATES v.

While the Restatement\nprovides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause\n\u201cbodily harm to others,\u201d 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7319, p. 129 (1963\u20131964), that duty terminates once the\nlegal basis for custody expires:\n     \u201cThere is no duty so to control the conduct of a third\n     person as to prevent him from causing physical harm\n     to another unless\n        \u201c(a) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor\n     to control the third person\u2019s conduct, or\n        \u201c(b) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the other which gives to the other a right to protec\n     tion.\u201d Id., \u00a7315, at 122.\nOnce the Federal Government\u2019s criminal jurisdiction over\na prisoner ends, so does any \u201cspecial relation[ship]\u201d be\ntween the Government and the former prisoner.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The Court also cites Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307 (1982), but\n\nthat case lends even less support than the Restatement. In Youngberg,\nan inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his\nconstitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his\nbed at the hospital infirmary. Id., at 310\u2013311. In assessing that claim,\nthis Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to \u201cprotect its\nresidents\u201d from the danger of violence. Id., at 320 (emphasis added).\nThe Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to \u201cnearby\n(and other) communities.\u201d Ante, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was a\nstate institution. Nothing in Youngberg suggests that the Federal\nGovernment can detain a person beyond the date on which its criminal\njurisdiction expires for fear that he may later pose a threat to the\nsurrounding community.\n  12 Federal law permits a sentencing court to order that a defendant be\n\nplaced on a term of \u201csupervised release\u201d after his term of imprisonment\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   For this reason, I cannot agree with JUSTICE ALITO that\n\u00a74248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress\u2019\npower \u201cto protect the public from dangers created by the\nfederal criminal justice and prison systems.\u201d Ante, at 3\n(concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant\u2019s\n\u201csexually dangerous\u201d propensities are not \u201ccreated by\u201d the\nfact of his incarceration or his relationship with the fed\neral prison system. The fact that the Federal Government\nhas the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of\npunishing him for a federal crime\u2014sex-related or other\nwise\u2014does not provide the Government with the addi\ntional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that\nperson.13\n                             2\n  Second, the Court describes \u00a74248 as a \u201cmodest\u201d expan\nsion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedi\ngree. Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice\ncould serve as a substitute for its constitutionality\u2014and\nthe Court admits that it cannot, ibid.\u2014the Court over\nstates the relevant history.\n  Congress\u2019 first foray into this general area occurred in\n1855, when it established St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital to pro\nvide treatment to \u201cinsane\u201d persons in the military and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nis complete. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73583, 3624(e). Contrary to the Government\u2019s\nsuggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals\nserving terms of \u201csupervised release\u201d does not derive from the Govern\nment\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,\nbut from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release thus\nserves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant\u2019s\nstatute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at\nsentencing.\n   13 The fact that Congress has the authority to \u201cprovide for the appre\n\nhension of escaped federal prisoners,\u201d see ante, at 3 (ALITO, J., concur\nring in judgment), does not change this conclusion. That authority\nderives from Congress\u2019 power to vindicate the enumerated power with\nwhich the escaped defendant\u2019s crime of conviction interfered, not a\nfreestanding police power.\n18                UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.\nBut Congress was acting pursuant to enumerated powers\nwhen it took this step. See Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 17 (granting\nCongress plenary authority over the District of Columbia);\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to \u201cmake Rules for\nthe Government and Regulation of the land and naval\nForces\u201d). This enactment therefore provides no support\nfor Congress\u2019 claimed power to detain sexually dangerous\npersons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.\n  Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commit\nment of \u201cinsane\u201d persons charged with or convicted of a\nfederal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \u00a7\u00a75\u20136, 11 Stat. 158; see\n17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212\u2013213 (1881); Act of June 23,\n1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat.\n330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did\nnot authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the\n\u201cterm\u201d of federal \u201cimprisonment,\u201d \u00a7\u00a72\u20133, 18 Stat. 252; see\n35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569,\n570\u2013571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, \u00a76, 46 Stat.\n271, and thus shed no light on the question presented\nhere.\n  In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive re\ngime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill\npersons in BOP custody. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74246, 4247\n(1952 ed.). This Court addressed that regime in Green\nwood, but never endorsed the proposition that the Federal\nGovernment could rely on that statute to detain a person\nin the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing\ncriminal sentence.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 In addition, at least some courts questioned the Federal Govern\n\nment\u2019s power to detain a person in such circumstances. See Dixon v.\nSteele, 104 F. Supp. 904, 908 (WD Mo. 1952) (holding that the Federal\nGovernment lacked authority to detain an individual declared mentally\nunfit to stand trial once it was determined that he was unlikely to\nrecover in time to be prosecuted); Higgins v. United States, 205 F. 2d\n650, 653 (CA9 1953) (avoiding this constitutional question by interpret\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  19\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   As already noted, Greenwood upheld the commitment of\na federal defendant declared unfit to stand trial on the\nnarrow ground that the Government\u2019s criminal jurisdic\ntion over the defendant\u2014its \u201cpower to prosecute for fed\neral offenses\u2014[wa]s not exhausted,\u201d but rather \u201cper\nsist[ed]\u201d in the form of a \u201cpending indictment.\u201d 350 U. S.,\nat 375; see supra, at 16. The Court was careful to state\nthat \u201c[t]his commitment, and therefore the legislation\nauthorizing commitment in the context of this case, in\nvolve[d] an assertion of authority\u201d within \u201ccongressional\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\u201d Green\nwood, 350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it painstak\ningly limited its holding to \u201cthe narrow constitutional\nissue raised by th[at] order of commitment.\u201d Ibid.\n   The historical record thus supports the Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s authority to detain a mentally ill person against\nwhom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But\nit provides no justification whatsoever for reading the\nNecessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power\nto authorize the detention of persons without a basis for\nfederal criminal jurisdiction.\n                              3\n  Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding\n\u00a74248\u2019s impact on the relationship between the Federal\nGovernment and the States. First, the Court and both\nconcurrences suggest that Congress must have had the\npower to enact \u00a74248 because a long period of federal\nincarceration might \u201cseve[r]\u201d a sexually dangerous pris\noner\u2019s \u201cclaim to \u2018legal residence\u2019 \u201d in any particular State,\nante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris\noner without any \u201chome State to take charge\u201d of him upon\nrelease, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ning the statute to permit federal civil detention only for a period rea\nsonably related to a criminal prosecution); Wells v. Attorney General of\nUnited States, 201 F. 2d 556, 560 (CA10 1953) (same).\n20                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat many federal prisoners, \u201cas a result of lengthy federal\nincarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any\nState\u201d). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As\nan initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional\nauthority to \u201ctake charge\u201d of a federal prisoner released\nwithin their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow\ners not delegated to the Federal Government are \u201cre\nserved\u201d to the States, and to the people). In addition, the\nassumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise\nthat authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern\nment stated at oral argument that its \u201cdefault position\u201d is\nto release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was\nconvicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR \u00a72.33(b)\n(2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue\nthat a State has the power to refuse such a person domi\ncile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,\nin the absence of 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248, a State would take no\naction when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger\nous federal prisoner was about to be released within its\njurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted\nin recent decades to protect communities from sex offend\ners,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 As we have noted before, all 50 States have developed \u201csome varia\ntion\u201d of a system \u201cfor mandatory registration of sex offenders and\ncorresponding community notification.\u201d Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89\u2013\n90 (2003). In addition, several States have taken further steps; some\nimpose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___, n. 5 (2008) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 11, n. 5) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22 States\nhave enacted involuntary civil-commitment laws substantially similar\nto \u00a74248, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a736\u20133701 et seq. (West 2009); Cal.\nWelf. & Inst. Code Ann. \u00a76600 et seq. (West 1988 and Supp. 2010); Fla.\nStat. \u00a7394.910 et seq. (2007); Ill. Comp. Stat.

But even in the event a State made such a deci\nsion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that\ndecision, and its consequences, to the state government\nalone.\n   Next, the Court submits that \u00a74248 does not upset the\nbalance of federalism or invade the States\u2019 reserved pow\ners because it \u201crequires accommodation of state interests\u201d\nby instructing the Attorney General to release a commit\nted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried\nif that State wishes to \u201c \u2018assume . . . responsibility\u2019 \u201d for\nhim. Ante, at 17 (quoting \u00a74248(d)). This right of first\nrefusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (\u201cIt is\nnot the usual course that the State does take responsibil\nity\u201d). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur\nance that \u00a74248 preserves the principle of dual sover\neignty\u2014the \u201cletter and spirit\u201d of the Constitution\u2014as the\nNecessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a7632.480 et seq.

Yet, I agree entirely with the\nCourt that \u201c \u2018it makes no difference whether one views the question at\nissue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to\nthe Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti\ntution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the\nStates under the Tenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu\ntional because it does not \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d an enumerated\npower. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti\ntution reserves to the States and to the people.\n22             UNITED STATES v.

For once it is determined that Congress\nhas the authority to provide for the civil detention of\nsexually dangerous persons, Congress \u201cis acting within the\npowers granted it under the Constitution,\u201d and \u201cmay\nimpose its will on the States.\u201d Gregory, 501 U. S., at 460;\nsee Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248\u2019s right of first refusal is\nthus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of\nlegislative grace.\n   Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that\n\u00a74248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not\nobject to Congress retaining custody of \u201csexually danger\nous persons\u201d after their criminal sentences expire because\nthe cost of detaining such persons is \u201cexpensive\u201d\u2014\napproximately $64,000 per year\u2014and these States would\nrather the Federal Government bear this expense.

(\u201c[S]ex offender civil commitment\nprograms are expensive to operate\u201d); id., at 4 (\u201cthese pro\ngrams are expensive\u201d); id., at 8 (\u201c[T]here are very practical\nreasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex\noffender civil commitment program . . . . One such reason\nis the significant cost\u201d).\n   Congress\u2019 power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;\nit does not expand merely to suit the States\u2019 policy prefer\nences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices\nregarding the allocation of state funds.

In determining whether the\n Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be \u201cmeans\n ends rationality\u201d between the enacted statute and the source of fed\n eral power. Sabri v. United States, 541 U. S. 600, 605. The Constitu\n tion \u201caddresse[s]\u201d the \u201cchoice of means\u201d \u201cprimarily . . . to the judg\n ment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really\n calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent\n to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship be\n tween the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    congressional determination alone.\u201d Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547\u2013548. Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants\n    Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifi\n    cally enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to\n    provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the secu\n    rity of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the\n    federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority\n    to do each of those things under the Clause. Pp. 5\u20139.\n       (2) Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental\n    health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil\n    commitment. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity De\n    fense Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74241\u20134247. A longstanding\n    history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute\u2019s con\n    stitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of City of New York, 397\n    U. S. 664, 678, but can be \u201chelpful in reviewing the substance of a\n    congressional statutory scheme,\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 21,\n    and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the\n    new statute and pre-existing federal interests. Section 4248 differs\n    from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due\n    to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Many of these individu\n    als, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under\n    \u00a74246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention\n    of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\n    thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). The similarities\n    between \u00a74246 and \u00a74248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest\n    addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework. Pp. 9\u201314.\n       (3) There are sound reasons for \u00a74248\u2019s enactment. The Federal\n    Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional\n    power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from\n    the danger such prisoners may pose. Moreover, \u00a74248 is \u201creasonably\n    adapted\u201d to Congress\u2019 power to act as a responsible federal custodian.\n    United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 121. Congress could have rea\n    sonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental ill\n    ness that causes them to \u201chave serious difficulty in refraining from\n    sexually violent conduct,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(6), would pose an especially high\n    danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have rea\n    sonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals\n    would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal\n    custody. Congress\u2019 desire to address these specific challenges, taken\n    together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the\n    conclusion that \u00a74248 satisfies \u201creview for means-end rationality,\u201d\n    Sabri, supra, at 605. Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (4) Respondents\u2019 contention that \u00a74248 violates the Tenth Amend\n    ment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  typically left to state control is rejected. That Amendment does not\n  \u201creserve to the States\u201d those powers that are \u201cdelegated to the United\n  States by the Constitution,\u201d including the powers delegated by the\n  Necessary and Proper Clause. See, e.g., New York v. United States,\n  505 U. S. 144, 159. And \u00a74248 does not \u201cinvade\u201d state sovereignty,\n  but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other\n  things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the\n  federal prisoner \u201cis domiciled or was tried\u201d of his detention, \u00a74248(d),\n  and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority\n  over the individual, which will prompt the individual\u2019s immediate\n  transfer to State custody, \u00a74248(d)(1). In Greenwood v. United\n  States, 350 U. S. 366, 375\u2013376, the Court rejected a similar challenge\n  to \u00a74248\u2019s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above. Because\n  the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of\n  state interests than \u00a74248, a fortiori, the current statute does not in\n  vade state interests. Pp. 16\u201318.\n    (5) Section 4248 is narrow in scope. The Court rejects respondents\u2019\n  argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and\n  Proper Clause, Congress\u2019 authority can be no more than one step re\n  moved from a specifically enumerated power. See, e.g., McCulloch,\n  supra, at 417. Nor will the Court\u2019s holding today confer on Congress\n  a general \u201cpolice power, which the Founders denied the National\n  Government and reposed in the States.\u201d United States v. Morrison,\n  529 U. S. 598, 618. Section \u00a74248 has been applied to only a small\n  fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals al\n  ready \u201cin the custody of the\u201d Federal Government, \u00a74248(a). Thus,\n  far from a \u201cgeneral police power,\u201d \u00a74248 is a reasonably adapted and\n  narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government\u2019s legitimate in\n  terest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its\n  prison system. See New York, supra, at 157. Pp. 18\u201322.\n    The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its\n  application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due\n  process, or any other constitutional rights.

S. C. \u00a74248. We have\npreviously examined similar statutes enacted under state\nlaw to determine whether they violate the Due Process\nClause. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346, 356\u2013358\n(1997); Kansas v. Crane, 534 U. S. 407 (2002). But this\ncase presents a different question. Here we ask whether\nthe Federal Government has the authority under Article I\nof the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment\nprogram or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a\ngovernment \u201cof enumerated powers.\u201d McCulloch v. Mary\nland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1320585/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (1819). We conclude that the\nConstitution grants Congress the authority to enact \u00a74248\nas \u201cnecessary and proper for carrying into Execution\u201d the\npowers \u201cvested by\u201d the \u201cConstitution in the Government of\nthe United States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18.\n                            I\n  The federal statute before us allows a district court to\n2              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder the civil commitment of an individual who is cur\nrently \u201cin the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,\u201d\n\u00a74248, if that individual (1) has previously \u201cengaged or\nattempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,\u201d (2) currently \u201csuffers from a serious mental\nillness, abnormality, or disorder,\u201d and (3) \u201cas a result of\u201d\nthat mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is \u201csexually\ndangerous to others,\u201d in that \u201che would have serious diffi\nculty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation if released.\u201d \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5)\u2013(6).\n   In order to detain such a person, the Government (act\ning through the Department of Justice) must certify to a\nfederal district judge that the prisoner meets the condi\ntions just described, i.e., that he has engaged in sexually\nviolent activity or child molestation in the past and that\nhe suffers from a mental illness that makes him corre\nspondingly dangerous to others. \u00a74248(a). When such a\ncertification is filed, the statute automatically stays the\nindividual\u2019s release from prison, ibid., thereby giving the\nGovernment an opportunity to prove its claims at a hear\ning through psychiatric (or other) evidence, \u00a7\u00a74247(b)\u2013(c),\n4248(b). The statute provides that the prisoner \u201cshall be\nrepresented by counsel\u201d and shall have \u201can opportunity\u201d at\nthe hearing \u201cto testify, to present evidence, to subpoena\nwitnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross\nexamine\u201d the Government\u2019s witnesses. \u00a7\u00a74247(d), 4248(c).\n   If the Government proves its claims by \u201cclear and con\nvincing evidence,\u201d the court will order the prisoner\u2019s con\ntinued commitment in \u201cthe custody of the Attorney Gen\neral,\u201d who must \u201cmake all reasonable efforts to cause\u201d the\nState where that person was tried, or the State where he\nis domiciled, to \u201cassume responsibility for his custody,\ncare, and treatment.\u201d \u00a74248(d); cf. Sullivan v. Freeman,\n944 F. 2d 334, 337 (CA7 1991). If either State is willing to\nassume that responsibility, the Attorney General \u201cshall\nrelease\u201d the individual \u201cto the appropriate official\u201d of that\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

App. 38\u201340, 44\u201352. During that same time period,\nthe Government instituted similar proceedings against the\nfifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court\nwith aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found\nmentally incompetent to stand trial. See id., at 41\u201343;\nUnited States v. Catron, No. 04\u2013778 (D Ariz., Mar. 27,\n2006); \u00a74241(d).\n4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil\ncommitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They\nclaimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, crimi\nnal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nand the Sixth and Eighth Amendments. 507 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 528. They claimed that the statute denies them sub\nstantive due process and equal protection of the laws.\nIbid. They claimed that it violates their procedural due\nprocess rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous\nness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead\nof by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid. And, finally,\nthey claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex\nceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, \u00a78 of the Consti\ntution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause\nand the Necessary and Proper Clause. 507 F. Supp. 2d, at\n528\u2013529.\n   The District Court, accepting two of the respondents\u2019\nclaims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with\nrespondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, id., at 551\u2013559 (citing In re Winship,\n397 U. S. 358 (1970)), and it agreed that, in enacting the\nstatute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative powers,\n507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530\u2013551. On appeal, the Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal on\nthis latter, legislative-power ground. 551 F. 3d 274, 278\u2013\n284 (2009). It did not decide the standard-of-proof ques\ntion, nor did it address any of respondents\u2019 other constitu\ntional challenges. Id., at 276, n. 1.\n   The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its\nrequest, limited to the question of Congress\u2019 authority\nunder Art. I, \u00a78 of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since\nthen, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that\nsame question, each deciding it in the Government\u2019s favor,\nthereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.\nSee United States v.

Tom, 565 F. 3d 497 (CA8 2009).\n                               II\n   The question presented is whether the Necessary and\nProper Clause, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18, grants Congress authority\nsufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that\nquestion, we assume, but we do not decide, that other\nprovisions of the Constitution\u2014such as the Due Process\nClause\u2014do not prohibit civil commitment in these circum\nstances. Cf. Hendricks, 521 U. S. 346; Addington v. Texas,\n441 U. S. 418 (1979). In other words, we assume for ar\ngument\u2019s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit\na State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether\nthe Federal Government, exercising its enumerated pow\ners, may enact such a statute as well. On that assump\ntion, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress\nlegislative power sufficient to enact \u00a74248. We base this\nconclusion on five considerations, taken together.\n   First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress\nbroad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200\nyears ago, this Court stated that the Federal \u201c[G]overn\nment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated\npowers,\u201d McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 405, which means that\n\u201c[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or\nmore of\u201d those powers, United States v. Morrison, 529\nU. S. 598, 607 (2000). But, at the same time, \u201ca govern\nment, entrusted with such\u201d powers \u201cmust also be en\ntrusted with ample means for their execution.\u201d\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 408. Accordingly, the Necessary\nand Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution\u2019s\ngrants of specific federal legislative authority are accom\npanied by broad power to enact laws that are \u201cconvenient,\nor useful\u201d or \u201cconducive\u201d to the authority\u2019s \u201cbeneficial\nexercise.\u201d Id., at 413, 418; see also id., at 421 (\u201c[Congress\ncan] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which\nmust be involved in the constitution . . .\u201d). Chief Justice\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMarshall emphasized that the word \u201cnecessary\u201d does not\nmean \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d Id., at 413\u2013415 (emphasis\ndeleted); Jinks v. Richland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462\n(2003) (\u201c[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress\nbe \u2018 \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d \u2019 to the exercise of an enumer\nated power\u201d). In language that has come to define the\nscope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:\n    \u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n    constitution, are constitutional.\u201d McCulloch, supra, at\n    421.\n   We have since made clear that, in determining whether\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the\nlegislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,\nwe look to see whether the statute constitutes a means\nthat is rationally related to the implementation of a con\nstitutionally enumerated power. Sabri v. United States,\n541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004) (using term \u201cmeans-ends ration\nality\u201d to describe the necessary relationship); ibid. (up\nholding Congress\u2019 \u201cauthority under the Necessary and\nProper Clause\u201d to enact a criminal statute in furtherance\nof the federal power granted by the Spending Clause); see\nGonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (holding that\nbecause \u201cCongress had a rational basis\u201d for concluding\nthat a statute implements Commerce Clause power, the\nstatute falls within the scope of congressional \u201cauthority to\n\u2018make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper\u2019 to\n\u2018regulate Commerce . . . among the several States\u2019 \u201d (ellip\nsis in original)); see also United States v.

I, \u00a78, must\nalso \u201cnot [be] prohibited\u201d by the Constitution. McCulloch,\nsupra, at 421. But as we have already stated, the present\nstatute\u2019s validity under provisions of the Constitution\nother than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue\nthat is not before us. Under the question presented, the\nrelevant inquiry is simply \u201cwhether the means chosen are\n\u2018reasonably adapted\u2019 to the attainment of a legitimate end\nunder the commerce power\u201d or under other powers that\nthe Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple\nment. Gonzales, supra, at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment) (quoting United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100,\n121 (1941)).\n   We have also recognized that the Constitution \u201cad\ndresse[s]\u201d the \u201cchoice of means\u201d\n    \u201cprimarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can\n    be seen that the means adopted are really calculated\n    to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the ex\n    tent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of\n    the relationship between the means adopted and the\n    end to be attained, are matters for congressional de\n    termination alone.\u201d Burroughs v. United States, 290\n    U. S. 534, 547\u2013548 (1934).\nSee also Lottery Case, 188 U.

I, \u00a78, cls. 6, 10; Art. III, \u00a73, nonetheless grants\nCongress broad authority to create such crimes. See\n8               UNITED STATES v.

Fox, 95 U. S. 670, 672\n(1878). And Congress routinely exercises its authority to\nenact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its\nenumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign\ncommerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the\ngeneral welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish\npost offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturali\nzation, and so forth.

See, e.g., \u00a71791 (prohibit\ning smuggling contraband); \u00a7751 et seq. (prohibiting es\ncape and abetting thereof); 28 CFR \u00a7541.10 et seq. (2009)\n(inmate discipline).\n   Neither Congress\u2019 power to criminalize conduct, nor its\npower to imprison individuals who engage in that conduct,\nnor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prison\ners, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Con\ngress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of\nthose things in the course of \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d the\nenumerated powers \u201cvested by\u201d the \u201cConstitution in the\nGovernment of the United States,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18\u2014\nauthority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause.\n   Second, the civil-commitment statute before us consti\ntutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related\nmental-health statutes that have existed for many dec\nades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of\nrelated federal action does not demonstrate a statute\u2019s\nconstitutionality. See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm\u2019n of City of\nNew York, 397 U. S. 664, 678 (1970) (\u201c[N]o one acquires a\nvested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by\nlong use . . .\u201d); cf. Morrison, 529 U. S., at 612\u2013614 (legisla\ntive history is neither necessary nor sufficient with respect\nto Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can\nnonetheless be \u201chelpful in reviewing the substance of a\ncongressional statutory scheme,\u201d Gonzales, 545 U. S., at\n21; Walz, supra, at 678, and, in particular, the reason\nableness of the relation between the new statute and pre\nexisting federal interests.\n   Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of\n10              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmental health care to federal prisoners, and has long\nprovided for their civil commitment. In 1855 it estab\nlished Saint Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital in the District of Colum\nbia to provide treatment to \u201cthe insane of the army and\nnavy . . . and of the District of Columbia.\u201d Act of Mar. 3,\n1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857 it provided for\nconfinement at Saint Elizabeth\u2019s of any person within the\nDistrict of Columbia who had been \u201ccharged with [a]\ncrime\u201d and who was \u201cinsane\u201d or later became \u201cinsane\nduring the continuance of his or her sentence in the\nUnited States penitentiary.\u201d Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \u00a7\u00a75\u20136, 11\nStat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212\u2013213 (1881). In\n1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes,\nCongress provided for civil commitment in federal facili\nties (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of \u201call per\nsons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in\nany court of the United States\u201d and who are or \u201cshall\nbecome\u201d insane \u201cduring the term of their imprisonment.\u201d\nAct of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis\nadded). And in 1882 Congress provided for similar com\nmitment of those \u201ccharged\u201d with federal offenses who\nbecome \u201cinsane\u201d while in the \u201ccustody\u201d of the United\nStates. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis\nadded). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress\ncreated a national, federal civil-commitment program\nunder which any person who was either charged with or\nconvicted of any federal offense in any federal court could\nbe confined in a federal mental institution.\n   These statutes did not raise the question presented\nhere, for they all provided that commitment in a federal\nhospital would end upon the completion of the relevant\n\u201cterms\u201d of federal \u201cimprisonment\u201d as set forth in the un\nderlying criminal sentence or statute. \u00a7\u00a72\u20133, 18 Stat. 252;\nsee 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen.\n569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940\u2019s that proviso was\neliminated.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States\nproposed legislative reforms of the federal civil\ncommitment system. The Judicial Conference based its\nproposals upon what this Court has described as a \u201clong\nstudy by a conspicuously able committee\u201d (chaired by\nJudge Calvert Magruder and whose members included\nJudge Learned Hand), involving consultation \u201cwith federal\ndistrict and circuit judges\u201d across the country as well as\nwith the Department of Justice. Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366, 373 (1956); Greenwood v. United\nStates, 219 F. 2d 376, 380\u2013384 (CA8 1955) (describing the\ncommittee\u2019s work). The committee studied, among other\nthings, the \u201cserious problem faced by the Bureau of Pris\nons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the\nexpiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be\ndangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no\nstate will assume responsibility for their custody.\u201d Judi\ncial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment\nAccorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged\nwith Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report),\nApp. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in\nwhich the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the prob\nlem of \u201c \u2018paranoid\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018threatening\u2019 \u201d individuals whom\nno State would accept. Id., at 9, App. 71. And it noted\nthat, in the Bureau\u2019s \u201c[e]xperience,\u201d States would not\naccept an \u201cappreciable number\u201d of \u201cmental[ly] incompe\ntent\u201d individuals \u201cnearing expiration\u201d of their prison\nterms, because of their \u201clack of legal residence in any\nState,\u201d even though those individuals \u201cought not . . . be at\nlarge because they constitute a menace to public safety.\u201d\nH. R. Rep. No. 1319, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1949) (state\nment of James V. Bennett, Director); see also Letter from\nBennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee\nReport, App. 83\u201388. The committee, hence the Judicial\nConference, therefore recommended that Congress enact\n\u201csome provision of law authorizing the continued confine\n12               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nment of such persons after their sentences expired.\u201d\nCommittee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the\nJudicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).\n  Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the\nJudicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.\nSee Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74241\u2013\n4243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74244\u20134248. It provided for the civil commit\nment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally\nincompetent at any time after their arrest and before the\nexpiration of their federal sentence, \u00a7\u00a74241, 4244, 4247\u2013\n4248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards,\n\u00a7\u00a74242, 4246, 4247. With respect to an individual whose\nprison term is about to expire, it specified the following:\n        \u201cWhenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons\n     shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to\n     expire has been examined [and] . . . in the judgment of\n     the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner\n     is insane or mentally incompetent, and . . . if released\n     he will probably endanger the safety of the officers,\n     the property, or other interests of the United States,\n     and that suitable arrangements for the custody and\n     care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the\n     Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to . . .\n     the court for the district in which the prisoner is con\n     fined. Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner\n     to be examined . . . and shall . . . hold a hearing . . . . If\n     upon such hearing the court shall determine that the\n     conditions specified above exist, the court may commit\n     the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or\n     his authorized representative.\u201d \u00a74247.\nThe precondition that the mentally ill individual\u2019s release\nwould \u201cprobably endanger the safety of the officers, the\nproperty, or other interests of the United States\u201d was\nuniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201crelease would endanger the safety of persons, property or\nthe public interest in general\u2014not merely the interests\npeculiar to the United States as such.\u201d United States v.\nCurry, 410 F. 2d 1372, 1374 (CA4 1969); see also Royal v.\nUnited States, 274 F. 2d 846, 851\u2013852 (CA10 1960).\n  In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See\nInsanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74241\u20134247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it\naltered the provision just discussed, regarding the pris\noner\u2019s danger to the \u201cinterests of the United States,\u201d to\nconform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpre\ntation of that language, i.e., it altered the language so as\nto authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to\nthe other conditions, the prisoner\u2019s \u201crelease would create a\nsubstantial risk of bodily injury to another person or\nserious damage to the property of another.\u201d \u00a74246(d).\n  Congress also elaborated upon the required condition\n\u201cthat suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise avail\nable\u201d by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative\nplacement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.\nSee ibid.; supra, at 2\u20133. With these modifications, the\nstatutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of\nindividuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once\nthey have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal\ncrime. \u00a7\u00a74241(d), 4246; see also \u00a74243(d). They continue\nto provide for the continued civil commitment of those\nindividuals when they are \u201cdue for release\u201d from federal\ncustody because their \u201csentence is about to expire.\u201d \u00a74246.\nAnd, as we have previously set forth, they establish vari\nous procedural and other requirements. E.g., \u00a74247.\n  In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before\nus. \u00a7302, 120 Stat. 619, 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248. It differs from\nearlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons\nwho, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.\nNotably, many of these individuals were likely already\nsubject to civil commitment under \u00a74246, which, since\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal\nprisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are\nthereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But\ncf. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013218, pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from\nits specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, \u00a74248 is\nsimilar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. \u00a74246.\nIn that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding\nfederal statutory framework, which has been in place\nsince 1855.\n   Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding\ncivil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually\ndangerous persons who are already in federal custody,\neven if doing so detains them beyond the termination of\ntheir criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Gov\nernment is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus\ntodian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to\nprotect nearby (and other) communities from the danger\nfederal prisoners may pose. Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 457\nU. S. 307, 320 (1982) (\u201cIn operating an institution such as\n[a prison system], there are occasions in which it is neces\nsary for the State to restrain the movement of residents\u2014\nfor example, to protect them as well as others from vio\nlence\u201d (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one\n\u201cwho takes charge of a third person\u201d is \u201cunder a duty to\nexercise reasonable care to control\u201d that person to prevent\nhim from causing reasonably foreseeable \u201cbodily harm to\nothers.\u201d    Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7319, p. 129\n(1963\u20131964); see Volungus, 595 F. 3d, at 7\u20138 (citing cases);\nsee also United States v. S. A., 129 F. 3d 995, 999 (CA8\n1997) (\u201c[Congress enacted \u00a74246] to avert the public dan\nger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and\ndangerous detainees\u201d). If a federal prisoner is infected\nwith a communicable disease that threatens others, surely\nit would be \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d for the Federal Gov\nernment to take action, pursuant to its role as federal\ncustodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes)\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto release that individual among the general public, where\nhe might infect others (even if not threatening an inter\nstate epidemic, cf. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3). And if confinement of\nsuch an individual is a \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d thing to do,\nthen how could it not be similarly \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d\nto confine an individual whose mental illness threatens\nothers to the same degree?\n   Moreover, \u00a74248 is \u201creasonably adapted,\u201d Darby, 312\nU. S., at 121, to Congress\u2019 power to act as a responsible\nfederal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal\ncriminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement\nconstitutionally enumerated authority, see supra, at 7\u20138).\nCongress could have reasonably concluded that federal\ninmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them\nto \u201chave serious difficulty in refraining from sexually\nviolent conduct,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(6), would pose an especially\nhigh danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013218, at 22\u201323. And Congress could also have rea\nsonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference\u2019s\nreport) that a reasonable number of such individuals\nwould likely not be detained by the States if released from\nfederal custody, in part because the Federal Government\nitself severed their claim to \u201clegal residence in any State\u201d\nby incarcerating them in remote federal prisons.

Here\nCongress\u2019 desire to address the specific challenges identi\nfied in the Reports cited above, taken together with its\nresponsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the con\nclusion that \u00a74248 satisfies \u201creview for means-end ration\nality,\u201d i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution\u2019s insistence\nthat a federal statute represent a rational means for im\nplementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.\nSabri, 541 U.

Respondents con\ntend that the States are nonetheless \u201cpowerless to prevent\nthe detention of their citizens under \u00a74248, even if deten\ntion is contrary to the States\u2019 policy choices.\u201d Brief for\nRespondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nmost natural reading of the statute, see \u00a7\u00a74248(d)(1)\u2013(e),\nand the Solicitor General acknowledges that \u201cthe Federal\nGovernment would have no appropriate role\u201d with respect\nto an individual covered by the statute once \u201cthe transfer\nto State responsibility and State control has occurred.\u201d Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 9.\n   In Greenwood, 350 U. S. 366, the Court rejected a chal\nlenge to the current statute\u2019s predecessor\u2014i.e., to the 1949\nstatute we described above, supra, at 11\u201312. The petition\ners in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that\nthe statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty.\nSee Brief for Petitioner in Greenwood v. United States,\nO. T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18\u201329. But the Court rejected\nthat argument. See Greenwood, supra, at 375\u2013376. And\nthe version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less\nprotective of state interests than the current statute. That\nstatute authorized federal custody so long as \u201csuitable\narrangements\u201d were \u201cnot otherwise available\u201d in a State or\notherwise. 63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for\n18              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPetitioner in Greenwood, supra, at 25 (\u201cWhat has really\nhappened is that the Federal government has been dissat\nisfied with the care given by the states to those mentally\nincompetent who have been released by the Federal au\nthorities\u201d). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, \u00a74248\nrequires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant\nStates to take custody of the individual without inquiring\ninto the \u201csuitability\u201d of their intended care or treatment,\nand to relinquish federal authority whenever a State\nasserts its own. \u00a74248(d). Thus, if the statute at issue in\nGreenwood did not invade state interests, then, a fortiori,\nneither does \u00a74248.\n   Fifth, the links between \u00a74248 and an enumerated\nArticle I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the\nstatutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the\ncautionary instruction that we may not \u201cpile inference\nupon inference\u201d in order to sustain congressional action\nunder Article I, Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, respondents\nargue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary\nand Proper Clause, Congress\u2019 authority can be no more\nthan one step removed from a specifically enumerated\npower. See Brief for Respondents 21\u201322; Tr. of Oral Arg.\n27\u201328. But this argument is irreconcilable with our prece\ndents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that\ncase we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of\na mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac\ncused of robbing a United States Post Office. 350 U. S., at\n369, 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was\nthe power to \u201cEstablish Post Offices and Post Roads.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 7. But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized\nin McCulloch,\n     \u201cthe power \u2018to establish post offices and post roads\u2019\n     . . . is executed by the single act of making the estab\n     lishment. . . . [F]rom this has been inferred the power\n     and duty of carrying the mail along the post road,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    from one post office to another.          And, from\n    this implied power, has again been inferred the right\n    to punish those who steal letters from the post office,\n    or rob the mail.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 417 (emphasis added).\nAnd, as we have explained, from the implied power to\npunish we have further inferred both the power to im\nprison, see supra, at 8\u20139, and, in Greenwood, the federal\ncivil-commitment power.\n   Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multi\nple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in Sabri\nwe observed that \u201cCongress has authority under the\nSpending Clause to appropriate federal moneys\u201d and that\nit therefore \u201chas corresponding authority under the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars\u201d\nare not \u201csiphoned off\u201d by \u201ccorrupt public officers.\u201d 541\nU. S., at 605 (citation omitted). We then further held that,\nin aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of \u201ctax\npayer dollars,\u201d Congress has the additional prophylactic\npower to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the\nstolen funds have not been \u201ctraceably skimmed from\nspecific federal payments.\u201d Ibid. Similarly, in United\nStates v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343 (1879), we held that the Neces\nsary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in\nfurtherance of Art. I, \u00a78, cls. 11\u201313, to award \u201cpensions to\nthe wounded and disabled\u201d soldiers of the armed forces\nand their dependents, 98 U. S. at 351; and from that im\nplied power we further inferred the \u201c[i]mplied power\u201d \u201cto\npass laws to . . . punish\u201d anyone who fraudulently appro\npriated such pensions, id., at 346. See also Stewart v.\nKahn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88343\"><a href=\"/opinion/88343/stewart-v-kahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506\u2013507 (1871).\n   Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress\nhas the implied power to criminalize any conduct that\nmight interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power,\nand also the additional power to imprison people who\nviolate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the\n20              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nadditional power to provide for the safe and reasonable\nmanagement of those prisons, and the additional power to\nregulate the prisoners\u2019 behavior even after their release.\nSee post, at 12\u201313, 17, n. 11. Of course, each of those\npowers, like the powers addressed in Sabri, Hall, and\nMcCulloch, is ultimately \u201cderived from\u201d an enumerated\npower, Hall, supra, at 345. And, as the dissent agrees,\nthat enumerated power is \u201cthe enumerated power that\njustifies the defendant\u2019s statute of conviction,\u201d post, at 17,\nn. 11. Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single\nspecific enumerated power \u201cthat justifies a criminal de\nfendant\u2019s arrest or conviction,\u201d post, at 12, in all cases\nbecause Congress relies on different enumerated powers\n(often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause power) to\nenact its various federal criminal statutes, see supra, at 7\u2013\n8. But every such statute must itself be legitimately\npredicated on an enumerated power. And the same enu\nmerated power that justifies the creation of a federal\ncriminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied\nfederal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justi\nfies civil commitment under \u00a74248 as well. See supra, at\n14\u201316. Thus, we must reject respondents\u2019 argument that\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a\nsingle step between an enumerated power and an Act of\nCongress.\n   Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on\nCongress a general \u201cpolice power, which the Founders\ndenied the National Government and reposed in the\nStates.\u201d Morrison, 529 U. S., at 618. As the Solicitor\nGeneral repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, \u00a74248 is\nnarrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small frac\ntion of federal prisoners. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24\u201325 (105\nindividuals have been subject to \u00a74248 out of over 188,000\nfederal inmates); see also Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\nJustice Statistics, W. Sabol, H.

As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly 200 years\nago, the Necessary and Proper Clause is part of \u201ca consti\ntution intended to endure for ages to come, and, conse\nquently, to be adapted to the various crises of human\naffairs.\u201d McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 415 (emphasis deleted).\n22              UNITED STATES v.

They in\nclude: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause,\n(2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena,\n(3) the sound reasons for the statute\u2019s enactment in light\nof the Government\u2019s custodial interest in safeguarding the\npublic from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4)\nthe statute\u2019s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the\nstatute\u2019s narrow scope. Taken together, these considera\ntions lead us to conclude that the statute is a \u201cnecessary\nand proper\u201d means of exercising the federal authority that\npermits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to pun\nish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appro\npriately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security\nof those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected\nby the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution\nconsequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.\n   We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or\nits application denies equal protection of the laws, proce\ndural or substantive due process, or any other rights\nguaranteed by the Constitution. Respondents are free to\npursue those claims on remand, and any others they have\npreserved.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit with respect to Congress\u2019 power to enact this stat\nute is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a74248 are necessary and\nproper exercises of congressional authority.\n   Respondents argue that congressional authority under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause can be no more than one\nstep removed from an enumerated power. This is incor\nrect. When the inquiry is whether a federal law has suffi\ncient links to an enumerated power to be within the scope\nof federal authority, the analysis depends not on the num\nber of links in the congressional-power chain but on the\nstrength of the chain.\n   Concluding that a relation can be put into a verbal\nformulation that fits somewhere along a causal chain of\nfederal powers is merely the beginning, not the end, of the\nconstitutional inquiry. See United States v. Lopez, 514\nU. S. 549, 566\u2013567 (1995). The inferences must be con\ntrolled by some limitations lest, as Thomas Jefferson\nwarned, congressional powers become completely un\nbounded by linking one power to another ad infinitum in a\nveritable game of \u201c \u2018this is the house that Jack built.\u2019 \u201d\nLetter from Thomas Jefferson to Edward Livingston (Apr.\n30, 1800), 31 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 547 (B.\nOberg ed. 2004); see also United States v.

The first is\nto withhold assent from certain statements and proposi\ntions of the Court\u2019s opinion. The second is to caution that\nthe Constitution does require the invalidation of congres\nsional attempts to extend federal powers in some\ninstances.\n                               I\n   The Court concludes that, when determining whether\nCongress has the authority to enact a specific law under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause, we look \u201cto see whether\nthe statute constitutes a means that is rationally related\nto the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated\npower.\u201d Ante, at 6 (suggesting that Sabri v. United States,\n541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004), adopts a \u201cmeans-ends rational\nity\u201d test).\n   The terms \u201crationally related\u201d and \u201crational basis\u201d must\nbe employed with care, particularly if either is to be used\nas a stand-alone test. The phrase \u201crational basis\u201d most\noften is employed to describe the standard for determining\nwhether legislation that does not proscribe fundamental\nliberties nonetheless violates the Due Process Clause.\nReferring to this due process inquiry, and in what must be\none of the most deferential formulations of the standard\nfor reviewing legislation in all the Court\u2019s precedents, the\nCourt has said: \u201cBut the law need not be in every respect\nlogically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is\nenough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and\nthat it might be thought that the particular legislative\nmeasure was a rational way to correct it.\u201d Williamson v.\nLee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 487\u2013488 (1955).\nThis formulation was in a case presenting a due process\nchallenge and a challenge to a State\u2019s exercise of its own\npowers, powers not confined by the principles that control\nthe limited nature of our National Government. The\nphrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\nissue before us.\n    The operative constitutional provision in this case is the\nNecessary and Proper Clause. This Court has not held\nthat the Lee Optical test, asking if \u201cit might be thought\nthat the particular legislative measure was a rational way\nto correct\u201d an evil, is the proper test in this context.\nRather, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, applica\ntion of a \u201crational basis\u201d test should be at least as exacting\nas it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more\nso. Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its\nopinion referring to \u201crational basis\u201d are predominantly\nCommerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases.\nSee ante, at 6 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1 (2005);\nLopez, supra; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recla\nmation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276 (1981)).\n    There is an important difference between the two ques\ntions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear.\nRaich, Lopez, and Hodel were all Commerce Clause cases.\nThose precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not\na mere conceivable rational relation, as in Lee Optical.\n\u201c \u2018[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particu\nlar activity substantially affects interstate commerce does\nnot necessarily make it so.\u2019 \u201d Lopez, supra, at 557, n. 2\n(quoting Hodel, supra, at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in\njudgment)). The rational basis referred to in the Com\nmerce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based\non empirical demonstration. While undoubtedly deferen\ntial, this may well be different from the rational-basis test\nas Lee Optical described it.\n    The Court relies on Sabri, supra, for its conclusion that\na \u201cmeans-ends rationality\u201d is all that is required for a\npower to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause\u2019s\nreach. See ante, at 6. Sabri only refers to \u201cmeans-ends\nrationality\u201d in a parenthetical describing the holding in\nMcCulloch v.

COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\narena through such a parenthetical. See Sabri, supra, at\n612 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cA statute can\nhave a \u2018rational\u2019 connection to an enumerated power with\nout being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated\npower\u201d). It should be remembered, moreover, that the\nspending power is not designated as such in the Constitu\ntion but rather is implied from the power to lay and collect\ntaxes and other specified exactions in order, among other\npurposes, \u201cto pay the Debts and provide for the common\nDefence and general Welfare of the United States.\u201d Art. I,\n\u00a78, cl. 1; see South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 206\n(1987). The limits upon the spending power have not been\nmuch discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to\nthe Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the ana\nlytic approach in those precedents should be respected.\n   A separate concern stems from the Court\u2019s explanation\nof the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 16. I had thought it a\nbasic principle that the powers reserved to the States\nconsist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remain\ning after taking account of powers granted to the National\nGovernment. The Constitution delegates limited powers\nto the National Government and then reserves the re\nmainder for the States (or the people), not the other way\naround, as the Court\u2019s analysis suggests. And the powers\nreserved to the States are so broad that they remain unde\nfined. Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps\nimperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and\nthe States alone.\n   It is correct in one sense to say that if the National\nGovernment has the power to act under the Necessary and\nProper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the\nStates. But the precepts of federalism embodied in the\nConstitution inform which powers are properly exercised\nby the National Government in the first place. See Lopez,\n514 U. S., at 580\u2013581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also\nMcCulloch, supra, at 421 (powers \u201cconsist[ent] with the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n               KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\nletter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional\u201d). It\nis of fundamental importance to consider whether essen\ntial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the\nassertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper\nClause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is\nnot one properly within the reach of federal power.\n   The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to\nhold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on\nthe exercise of congressional power are the Constitution\u2019s\nexpress prohibitions. The Court\u2019s discussion of the Tenth\nAmendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing\nfrom the federal system are of no import when defining\nthe limits of the National Government\u2019s power, as it pro\nceeds by first asking whether the power is within the\nNational Government\u2019s reach, and if so it discards federal\nism concerns entirely.\n   These remarks explain why the Court ignores important\nlimitations stemming from federalism principles. Those\nprinciples are essential to an understanding of the func\ntion and province of the States in our constitutional\nstructure.\n                              II\n   As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted\nwithin its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the\nfederal detention of prisoners does not endanger third\nparties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State\nto take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so\nit is incumbent on the National Government to act. This\nobligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in\ntort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an\nunstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.\nHaving acted within its constitutional authority to detain\nthe person, the National Government can acknowledge a\nduty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does\nnot prejudice the States and their citizens.\n6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n              KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   I would note, as the Court\u2019s opinion does, that \u00a74248\ndoes not supersede the right and responsibility of the\nStates to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil\nconfinement. The federal program in question applies\nonly to those in federal custody and thus involves little\nintrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the\nStates.\n   This is not a case in which the National Government\ndemands that a State use its own governmental system to\nimplement federal commands. See Printz v. United States,\n521 U. S. 898 (1997). It is not a case in which the Na\ntional Government relieves the States of their own pri\nmary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the\nsafety and well being of their citizens. See United States\nv. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598 (2000). Nor is it a case in which\nthe exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and\nduties traditionally committed to the State. See Lopez,\nsupra, at 580\u2013581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of author\nity over a small class of persons already subject to the\nfederal power.

S. C. \u00a74248, in order to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d\npowers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitu\ntion, see Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18.\n   Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from\nfederal prisoners who suffer from \u201ca serious mental ill\nness, abnormality, or disorder\u201d and who, if released, would\nhave \u201cserious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent\nconduct or child molestation.\u201d        See \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5), (6),\n4248(d). Under this law, if neither the State of a pris\noner\u2019s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was\ntried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner\u2019s\n\u201ccustody, care, and treatment,\u201d the Federal Government is\nauthorized to undertake that responsibility. \u00a74248(d).\nThe statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will\nassume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a\ndangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy\nfederal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to\nany State.\n2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  I entirely agree with the dissent that \u201c[t]he Necessary\nand Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those\nlaws that \u2018carr[y] into Execution\u2019 one or more of the federal\npowers enumerated in the Constitution,\u201d post, at 1, but\n\u00a74248 satisfies that requirement because it is a necessary\nand proper means of carrying into execution the enumer\nated powers that support the federal criminal statutes\nunder which the affected prisoners were convicted. The\nNecessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional\nauthority for most federal criminal statutes. In other\nwords, most federal criminal statutes rest upon a congres\nsional judgment that, in order to execute one or more of\nthe powers conferred on Congress, it is necessary and\nproper to criminalize certain conduct, and in order to do\nthat it is obviously necessary and proper to provide for the\noperation of a federal criminal justice system and a federal\nprison system.\n  All of this has been recognized since the beginning of\nour country. The First Congress enacted federal criminal\nlaws,1 created federal law enforcement and prosecutorial\npositions,2 established a federal court system,3 provided\nfor the imprisonment of persons convicted of federal\ncrimes,4 and gave United States marshals the responsibil\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 See, e.g., ch. 9, 1 Stat. 112 (\u201cAn Act for the Punishment of certain\nCrimes against the United States\u201d).\n   2 Ch. 20, \u00a735, id., at 92 (\u201c[T]here shall be appointed in each district a\n\nmeet person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States\nin such district, . . . whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district\nall delinquents for crimes and offences, cognizable under the authority\nof the United States\u201d).\n   3 \u00a71, id., at 73 (\u201cAn Act to establish the Judicial Courts of the United\n\nStates\u201d).\n   4 See, e.g., \u00a79, id., at 76\u201377 (providing that the federal district courts\n\nshall have exclusive jurisdiction over \u201call crimes and offences that shall\nbe cognizable under the authority of the United States, . . . where no\nother punishment than whipping, not exceeding thirty stripes, a fine\nnot exceeding one hundred dollars, or a term of imprisonment not\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

United States, 350 U. S. 366,\n373\u2013374 (1956). These federal prisoners, having been held\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nexceeding six months, is to be inflicted\u201d); see also J. Roberts, The\nFederal Bureau of Prisons: Its Mission, Its History, and Its Partnership\nWith Probation and Pretrial Services, 61 Fed. Probation 53 (1997)\n(explaining that federal prisoners were originally housed in state and\ncounty facilities on a contract basis).\n  5 See ch. 20, \u00a727, 1 Stat. 87 (\u201c[A] marshal shall be appointed in and\n\nfor each district for the term of four years, . . . whose duty it shall be to\nattend the district and circuit courts when sitting therein, . . .

COMSTOCK\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfor years in a federal prison, often had few ties to any\nState; it was a matter of speculation where they would\nchoose to go upon release; and accordingly no State was\nenthusiastic about volunteering to shoulder the burden of\ncivil commitment.\n  The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Con\ngress carte blanche. Although the term \u201cnecessary\u201d does\nnot mean \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d or indispensable, the\nterm requires an \u201cappropriate\u201d link between a power\nconferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by\nCongress. See McCulloch v.

And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce\ncompliance with that limitation. Id., at 423.\n  The law in question here satisfies that requirement.\nThis is not a case in which it is merely possible for a court\nto think of a rational basis on which Congress might have\nperceived an attenuated link between the powers underly\ning the federal criminal statutes and the challenged civil\ncommitment provision. Here, there is a substantial link to\nCongress\u2019 constitutional powers.\n  For this reason, I concur in the judgment that Congress\nhad the constitutional authority to enact 18 U. S.

Article I \u201cvest[s]\u201d in\nCongress \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,\u201d \u00a71, and\ncarefully enumerates those powers in \u00a78.

Second, there must be a\nnecessary and proper fit between the \u201cmeans\u201d (the federal\nlaw) and the \u201cend\u201d (the enumerated power or powers) it is\ndesigned to serve. Ibid. McCulloch accords Congress a\ncertain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit\nunder this second inquiry. The means Congress selects\nwill be deemed \u201cnecessary\u201d if they are \u201cappropriate\u201d and\n\u201cplainly adapted\u201d to the exercise of an enumerated power,\nand \u201cproper\u201d if they are not otherwise \u201cprohibited\u201d by the\nConstitution and not \u201c[in]consistent\u201d with its \u201cletter and\nspirit.\u201d Ibid.\n   Critically, however, McCulloch underscores the linear\nrelationship the Clause establishes between the two in\nquiries: Unless the end itself is \u201clegitimate,\u201d the fit be\ntween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no\nmatter how \u201cnecessary\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d an Act of Congress\nmay be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis\nlate if the objective is anything other than \u201ccarrying into\nExecution\u201d one or more of the Federal Government\u2019s enu\nmerated powers.

See, e.g., Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete\nAnti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist\nsupporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge,\nexplaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any\nfreestanding authority, but instead made explicit what\nwas already implicit in the grant of each enumerated\npower. Referring to the \u201cpowers declared in the Constitu\ntion,\u201d Alexander Hamilton noted that \u201cit is expressly to\nexecute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . author\nizes the national legislature to pass all necessary and\nproper laws.\u201d The Federalist No. 33, at 245.

As a conse\nquence, we have held that States may \u201ctake measures to\nrestrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill\u201d\u2014\nincluding those who are sexually dangerous\u2014provided\nthat such commitments satisfy due process and other\nconstitutional requirements. Kansas v. Hendricks, 521\nU. S. 346, 363 (1997).\n  Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil\ncommitment laws that States have enacted under their\nparens patriae and general police powers. Indeed, it is\nclear, on the face of the Act and in the Government\u2019s\narguments urging its constitutionality, that \u00a74248 is\naimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,\nnot toward \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d any enumerated\npower or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam\nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.\n587 (entitled \u201c[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual\nexploitation and violent crime\u201d), \u00a7102, id., at 590 (state\nment of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated\n\u201cto protect the public from sex offenders\u201d); Brief for United\nStates 38\u201339 (asserting the Federal Government\u2019s power\nto \u201cprotect the public from harm that might result upon\nthese prisoners\u2019 release, even when that harm might arise\nfrom conduct that is otherwise beyond the general regula\ntory powers of the federal government\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 For the reasons explained in Part III\u2013A\u20132, infra, the enumerated\n\npower that justifies a particular defendant\u2019s criminal arrest or convic\ntion cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under \u00a74248.\n8                  UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual of\nfenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a\ndespicable act with untold consequences for the victim\npersonally and society generally. See, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, (2008) (ALITO, J., dis\nsenting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2, 22\u201323). But the Constitution\ndoes not vest in Congress the authority to protect society\nfrom every bad act that might befall it.6 New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 157 (1992) (\u201c \u2018The question is\nnot what power the Federal Government ought to have\nbut what powers in fact have been given by the people\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936)).\n  In my view, this should decide the question. Section\n4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress\u2019\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress\nmay act under that Clause only when its legislation\n\u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d one of the Federal Government\u2019s\nenumerated powers. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Section 4248 does\nnot execute any enumerated power. Section 4248 is there\nfore unconstitutional.\n                             III\n   The Court perfunctorily genuflects to McCulloch\u2019s\nframework for assessing Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper\nClause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty\nit helps to maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor\nof a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that\n\u00a74248 is a \u201c \u2018necessary and proper\u2019 \u201d adjunct to a jumble of\nunenumerated \u201cauthorit[ies].\u201d Ante, at 22. The Court\u2019s\nnewly minted test cannot be reconciled with the Clause\u2019s\nplain text or with two centuries of our precedents inter\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The absence of a constitutional delegation of general police power to\n\nCongress does not leave citizens vulnerable to the harms Congress\nseeks to regulate in \u00a74248 because, as recent legislation indicates, the\nStates have the capacity to address the threat that sexual offenders\npose.

It also raises more questions than it answers.\nMust each of the five considerations exist before the Court\nsustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of\nCongress\u2019 Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What\nif the facts of a given case support a finding of only four\nconsiderations? Or three? And if three or four will suffice,\nwhich three or four are imperative? At a minimum, this\nshift from the two-step McCulloch framework to this five\nconsideration approach warrants an explanation as to why\nMcCulloch is no longer good enough and which of the five\nconsiderations will bear the most weight in future cases,\nassuming some number less than five suffices. (Or, if not,\nwhy all five are required.) The Court provides no answers\nto these questions.\n                            A\n  I begin with the first and last \u201cconsiderations\u201d in the\nCourt\u2019s inquiry. Ante, at 5. The Court concludes that\n\u00a74248 is a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 Necessary and\nProper Clause authority because that authority is \u201cbroad,\u201d\nibid., and because \u201cthe links between \u00a74248 and an enu\nmerated Article I power are not too attenuated,\u201d ante, at\n18. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies,\nMcCulloch\u2019s straightforward two-part test.\n                             1\n                             a\n  First, the Court describes Congress\u2019 lawmaking power\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause as \u201cbroad,\u201d relying\non precedents that have upheld federal laws under the\nClause after finding a \u201c \u2018rationa[l]\u2019 \u201d fit between the law\nand an enumerated power. Ante, at 6 (quoting Sabri v.\nUnited States, 541 U. S. 600, 605 (2004)). It is true that\nthis Court\u2019s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of\nlatitude in selecting the means for \u201ccarrying into Execu\n10                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntion\u201d an end that is \u201clegitimate.\u201d7 See, e.g., Jinks v. Rich\nland County, 538 U. S. 456, 462\u2013463 (2003) (citing\nMcCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 417, 421). But in citing these\ncases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit\nbetween means and ends matters only if the end is in fact\nlegitimate\u2014i.e., only if it is one of the Federal Govern\nment\u2019s enumerated powers.\n   By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference\nowed to Congress in selecting means to further a legiti\nmate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch\u2019s first step and\nfails carefully to examine whether the end served by \u00a74248\nis actually one of those powers. See Part III\u2013A\u20132, infra.\n                             b\n  Second, instead of asking the simple question of what\nenumerated power \u00a74248 \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d at\nMcCulloch\u2019s first step, the Court surveys other laws Con\ngress has enacted and concludes that, because \u00a74248 is\nrelated to those laws, the \u201clinks\u201d between \u00a74248 and an\nenumerated power are not \u201ctoo attenuated\u201d; hence, \u00a74248\nis a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 Necessary and Proper\nClause authority. Ante, at 18. This unnecessarily con\nfuses the analysis and, if followed to its logical extreme,\nwould result in an unwarranted expansion of federal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE KENNEDY concludes that the Necessary and Proper Clause\nrequires something beyond rational-basis scrutiny when assessing the\nfit between an enumerated power and the means Congress selects to\nexecute it. Ante, at 2\u20134 (opinion concurring in judgment). Other\narguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have\nbeen lodged elsewhere. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 61\n(2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (arguing that, for a law to be within the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an \u201c \u2018obvious, simple, and\ndirect relation\u2019 \u201d to an exercise of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers and\nmust not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty).\nBut I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the\nanalysis employed at McCulloch\u2019s second step, see McCulloch v.

From this, the Court assumes that \u00a74248 must also be\na valid exercise of congressional power because it is \u201c \u2018rea\nsonably adapted\u2019 \u201d to those exercises of Congress\u2019 inciden\ntal\u2014and thus unenumerated\u2014authorities. See ante, at 15\n(concluding that \u201c\u00a74248 is \u2018reasonably adapted\u2019 to Con\ngress\u2019 power to act as a responsible federal custodian\u201d\n(citation omitted)); ante, at 22 (concluding that \u201cthe stat\nute is a \u2018necessary and proper\u2019 means of exercising the\nfederal authority that permits Congress to create federal\ncriminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison viola\ntors, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to\nmaintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but\nwho may be affected by the federal imprisonment of oth\ners\u201d). But that is not the question. The Necessary and\nProper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to\nenact any law simply because it furthers other laws Con\ngress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental author\nity; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every\nfederal statute \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution\u201d one or more of\nthe Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 McCulloch   makes this point clear. As the Court notes, ante, at 18\u2013\n19, McCulloch states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress\u2019\nenumerated power to establish post offices and post roads \u201chas been\ninferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,\u201d and, \u201cfrom this\nimplied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who\nsteal letters from the post office, or rob the mail.\u201d 4 Wheat., at 417.\nContrary to the Court\u2019s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest\nthat the relationship between Congress\u2019 implied power to punish postal\ncrimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to\nsatisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead,\nMcCulloch directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress\u2019\n12                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes\nwith enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who\nengage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and\ntreatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal\nsentence satisfy this test because each helps to \u201ccarr[y]\ninto Execution\u201d the enumerated powers that justify a\ncriminal defendant\u2019s arrest or conviction. For example,\nCongress\u2019 enumerated power \u201c[t]o establish Post Offices\nand post Roads,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 7, would lack force or practi\ncal effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact crimi\nnal laws \u201cto punish those who steal letters from the post\noffice, or rob the mail.\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 417. Simi\nlarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if\nthere were no prisons to hold persons who violate those\nlaws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that\nprisoners could escape or demand their release on the\ngrounds that the conditions of their confinement violate\ntheir constitutional rights, at least as we have defined\nthem. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nenumerated power \u201c \u2018to establish post offices and post roads.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n(explaining that \u201cthe right to . . . punish those who rob [the mail] is not\nindispensably necessary to the establishment of a post office and post\nroad,\u201d but is \u201cessential to the beneficial exercise of th[at] power\u201d). More\nimportantly, McCulloch\u2019s holding, as well as the holdings of this Court\u2019s\nsubsequent decisions, make plain that congressional action is valid\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause only if it carries into execution\none or more enumerated powers.

In other words, the Court analogizes\n\u00a74248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care\nfor federal inmates while they serve sentences or await\ntrial. But while those laws help to \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d\nthe enumerated power that justifies the imposition of\ncriminal sanctions on the inmate, \u00a74248 does not bear that\nessential characteristic for three reasons.\n   First, the statute\u2019s definition of a \u201csexually dangerous\nperson\u201d contains no element relating to the subject\u2019s\ncrime. See \u00a7\u00a74247(a)(5)\u2013(6). It thus does not require a\nfederal court to find any connection between the reasons\nsupporting civil commitment and the enumerated power\nwith which that person\u2019s criminal conduct interfered. As a\nconsequence, \u00a74248 allows a court to civilly commit an\nindividual without finding that he was ever charged with\nor convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence.\n\u00a7\u00a74248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely hypothetical:\nThe Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals\nagainst whom \u00a74248 proceedings have been brought fit\nthis description.9 Tr. of Oral Arg. 23\u201325.\n   Second, \u00a74248 permits the term of federal civil commit\nment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The statute does require the court to find that the subject \u201chas en\n\ngaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child\nmolestation,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5), but that factual predicate can be established\nby a state conviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the\nperson committed a sex crime for which he was never charged.\n14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nprisoner\u2019s sentence expires or the date on which the stat\nute of limitations on an untried defendant\u2019s crime has run.\nThe statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a\nperson at a time when the Government would lack juris\ndiction to detain him for violating a criminal law that\nexecutes an enumerated power.\n   The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United\nStates, 350 U. S. 366 (1956), provides a useful contrast.\nThat statute authorized the Federal Government to exer\ncise civil custody over a federal defendant declared men\ntally unfit to stand trial only \u201c \u2018until the accused shall be\nmentally competent to stand trial or until the pending\ncharges against him are disposed of according to law.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 368, n. 2 (quoting 18 U. S. C. \u00a74246 (1952 ed.)).\nThus, that statute\u2019s \u201cend\u201d reasonably could be interpreted\nas preserving the Government\u2019s power to enforce a crimi\nnal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.),\nhowever, authorizes federal detention of a person even\nafter the Government loses the authority to prosecute him\nfor a federal crime.\n   Third, the definition of a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d\nrelevant to \u00a74248 does not require the court to find that\nthe person is likely to violate a law executing an enumer\nated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern\nment has no express power to regulate sexual violence\ngenerally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscrib\ning such conduct in special circumstances. All of these\nstatutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a\nconnection to one of Congress\u2019 enumerated powers\u2014such\nas interstate commerce, e.g., \u00a72252(a)(2)\u2014or that limit the\nstatute\u2019s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has\nplenary authority, e.g., \u00a72243(a). Section 4248, by con\ntrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that\nthe person is \u201csexually dangerous,\u201d and presents a risk \u201cto\nothers,\u201d \u00a74247(a)(5).

While the Restatement\nprovides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable\nsteps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause\n\u201cbodily harm to others,\u201d 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\u00a7319, p. 129 (1963\u20131964), that duty terminates once the\nlegal basis for custody expires:\n     \u201cThere is no duty so to control the conduct of a third\n     person as to prevent him from causing physical harm\n     to another unless\n        \u201c(a) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor\n     to control the third person\u2019s conduct, or\n        \u201c(b) a special relation exists between the actor and\n     the other which gives to the other a right to protec\n     tion.\u201d Id., \u00a7315, at 122.\nOnce the Federal Government\u2019s criminal jurisdiction over\na prisoner ends, so does any \u201cspecial relation[ship]\u201d be\ntween the Government and the former prisoner.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The Court also cites Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307 (1982), but\n\nthat case lends even less support than the Restatement. In Youngberg,\nan inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his\nconstitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his\nbed at the hospital infirmary. Id., at 310\u2013311. In assessing that claim,\nthis Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to \u201cprotect its\nresidents\u201d from the danger of violence. Id., at 320 (emphasis added).\nThe Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to \u201cnearby\n(and other) communities.\u201d Ante, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was a\nstate institution. Nothing in Youngberg suggests that the Federal\nGovernment can detain a person beyond the date on which its criminal\njurisdiction expires for fear that he may later pose a threat to the\nsurrounding community.\n  12 Federal law permits a sentencing court to order that a defendant be\n\nplaced on a term of \u201csupervised release\u201d after his term of imprisonment\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  17\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n   For this reason, I cannot agree with JUSTICE ALITO that\n\u00a74248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress\u2019\npower \u201cto protect the public from dangers created by the\nfederal criminal justice and prison systems.\u201d Ante, at 3\n(concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant\u2019s\n\u201csexually dangerous\u201d propensities are not \u201ccreated by\u201d the\nfact of his incarceration or his relationship with the fed\neral prison system. The fact that the Federal Government\nhas the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of\npunishing him for a federal crime\u2014sex-related or other\nwise\u2014does not provide the Government with the addi\ntional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that\nperson.13\n                             2\n  Second, the Court describes \u00a74248 as a \u201cmodest\u201d expan\nsion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedi\ngree. Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice\ncould serve as a substitute for its constitutionality\u2014and\nthe Court admits that it cannot, ibid.\u2014the Court over\nstates the relevant history.\n  Congress\u2019 first foray into this general area occurred in\n1855, when it established St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital to pro\nvide treatment to \u201cinsane\u201d persons in the military and the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nis complete. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73583, 3624(e). Contrary to the Government\u2019s\nsuggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals\nserving terms of \u201csupervised release\u201d does not derive from the Govern\nment\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,\nbut from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release thus\nserves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant\u2019s\nstatute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at\nsentencing.\n   13 The fact that Congress has the authority to \u201cprovide for the appre\n\nhension of escaped federal prisoners,\u201d see ante, at 3 (ALITO, J., concur\nring in judgment), does not change this conclusion. That authority\nderives from Congress\u2019 power to vindicate the enumerated power with\nwhich the escaped defendant\u2019s crime of conviction interfered, not a\nfreestanding police power.\n18                UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict of Columbia. Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682.\nBut Congress was acting pursuant to enumerated powers\nwhen it took this step. See Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 17 (granting\nCongress plenary authority over the District of Columbia);\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to \u201cmake Rules for\nthe Government and Regulation of the land and naval\nForces\u201d). This enactment therefore provides no support\nfor Congress\u2019 claimed power to detain sexually dangerous\npersons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.\n  Later, Congress provided for the federal civil commit\nment of \u201cinsane\u201d persons charged with or convicted of a\nfederal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, \u00a7\u00a75\u20136, 11 Stat. 158; see\n17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212\u2013213 (1881); Act of June 23,\n1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251; Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat.\n330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did\nnot authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the\n\u201cterm\u201d of federal \u201cimprisonment,\u201d \u00a7\u00a72\u20133, 18 Stat. 252; see\n35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 569,\n570\u2013571 (1916); Act of May 13, 1930, ch. 254, \u00a76, 46 Stat.\n271, and thus shed no light on the question presented\nhere.\n  In 1949, Congress enacted a more comprehensive re\ngime, authorizing the civil commitment of mentally ill\npersons in BOP custody. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a74246, 4247\n(1952 ed.). This Court addressed that regime in Green\nwood, but never endorsed the proposition that the Federal\nGovernment could rely on that statute to detain a person\nin the absence of a pending criminal charge or ongoing\ncriminal sentence.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 In addition, at least some courts questioned the Federal Govern\n\nment\u2019s power to detain a person in such circumstances. See Dixon v.\nSteele, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1621536\"><a href=\"/opinion/1621536/dixon-v-steele/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

S.,\nat 375; see supra, at 16. The Court was careful to state\nthat \u201c[t]his commitment, and therefore the legislation\nauthorizing commitment in the context of this case, in\nvolve[d] an assertion of authority\u201d within \u201ccongressional\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause.\u201d Green\nwood, 350 U. S., at 375 (emphasis added). But it painstak\ningly limited its holding to \u201cthe narrow constitutional\nissue raised by th[at] order of commitment.\u201d Ibid.\n   The historical record thus supports the Federal Gov\nernment\u2019s authority to detain a mentally ill person against\nwhom it has the authority to enforce a criminal law. But\nit provides no justification whatsoever for reading the\nNecessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power\nto authorize the detention of persons without a basis for\nfederal criminal jurisdiction.\n                              3\n  Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding\n\u00a74248\u2019s impact on the relationship between the Federal\nGovernment and the States. First, the Court and both\nconcurrences suggest that Congress must have had the\npower to enact \u00a74248 because a long period of federal\nincarceration might \u201cseve[r]\u201d a sexually dangerous pris\noner\u2019s \u201cclaim to \u2018legal residence\u2019 \u201d in any particular State,\nante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris\noner without any \u201chome State to take charge\u201d of him upon\nrelease, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ning the statute to permit federal civil detention only for a period rea\nsonably related to a criminal prosecution); Wells v. Attorney General of\nUnited States, 201 F. 2d 556, 560 (CA10 1953) (same).\n20                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsee ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthat many federal prisoners, \u201cas a result of lengthy federal\nincarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any\nState\u201d). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As\nan initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional\nauthority to \u201ctake charge\u201d of a federal prisoner released\nwithin their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow\ners not delegated to the Federal Government are \u201cre\nserved\u201d to the States, and to the people). In addition, the\nassumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise\nthat authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern\nment stated at oral argument that its \u201cdefault position\u201d is\nto release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was\nconvicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR \u00a72.33(b)\n(2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue\nthat a State has the power to refuse such a person domi\ncile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,\nin the absence of 18 U. S. C. \u00a74248, a State would take no\naction when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger\nous federal prisoner was about to be released within its\njurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted\nin recent decades to protect communities from sex offend\ners,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 As we have noted before, all 50 States have developed \u201csome varia\ntion\u201d of a system \u201cfor mandatory registration of sex offenders and\ncorresponding community notification.\u201d Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89\u2013\n90 (2003). In addition, several States have taken further steps; some\nimpose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see, e.g., Kennedy v.\nLouisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___, n. 5 (2008) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 11, n. 5) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22 States\nhave enacted involuntary civil-commitment laws substantially similar\nto \u00a74248, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a736\u20133701 et seq. (West 2009); Cal.\nWelf. & Inst. Code Ann. \u00a76600 et seq. (West 1988 and Supp. 2010); Fla.\nStat. \u00a7394.910 et seq. (2007); Ill. Comp. Stat.

But even in the event a State made such a deci\nsion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that\ndecision, and its consequences, to the state government\nalone.\n   Next, the Court submits that \u00a74248 does not upset the\nbalance of federalism or invade the States\u2019 reserved pow\ners because it \u201crequires accommodation of state interests\u201d\nby instructing the Attorney General to release a commit\nted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried\nif that State wishes to \u201c \u2018assume . . . responsibility\u2019 \u201d for\nhim. Ante, at 17 (quoting \u00a74248(d)). This right of first\nrefusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (\u201cIt is\nnot the usual course that the State does take responsibil\nity\u201d). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur\nance that \u00a74248 preserves the principle of dual sover\neignty\u2014the \u201cletter and spirit\u201d of the Constitution\u2014as the\nNecessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a7632.480 et seq.

Yet, I agree entirely with the\nCourt that \u201c \u2018it makes no difference whether one views the question at\nissue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to\nthe Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti\ntution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the\nStates under the Tenth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting New York v.\nUnited States, 505 U. S. 144, 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu\ntional because it does not \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d an enumerated\npower. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti\ntution reserves to the States and to the people.\n22             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nWheat., at 421; Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898,\n923\u2013924 (1997). For once it is determined that Congress\nhas the authority to provide for the civil detention of\nsexually dangerous persons, Congress \u201cis acting within the\npowers granted it under the Constitution,\u201d and \u201cmay\nimpose its will on the States.\u201d Gregory, 501 U. S., at 460;\nsee Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248\u2019s right of first refusal is\nthus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of\nlegislative grace.\n   Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that\n\u00a74248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not\nobject to Congress retaining custody of \u201csexually danger\nous persons\u201d after their criminal sentences expire because\nthe cost of detaining such persons is \u201cexpensive\u201d\u2014\napproximately $64,000 per year\u2014and these States would\nrather the Federal Government bear this expense. Brief\nfor Kansas et al. 2; ibid. (\u201c[S]ex offender civil commitment\nprograms are expensive to operate\u201d); id., at 4 (\u201cthese pro\ngrams are expensive\u201d); id., at 8 (\u201c[T]here are very practical\nreasons to prefer a system that includes a federal sex\noffender civil commitment program . . . . One such reason\nis the significant cost\u201d).\n   Congress\u2019 power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;\nit does not expand merely to suit the States\u2019 policy prefer\nences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices\nregarding the allocation of state funds.
