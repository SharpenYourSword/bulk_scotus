ABBOTT\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08\u2013645.      Argued January 12, 2010\u2014Decided May 17, 2010\nAfter the Abbotts, a married couple, moved to Chile and separated, the\n  Chilean courts granted respondent wife daily care and control of their\n  minor son, A. J. A., while awarding petitioner husband visitation\n  rights. Mr. Abbott also had a ne exeat right to consent before Ms. Ab\n  bott could take A. J. A. out of the country under Chile Minors Law\n  16,618 (Minors Law 16,618), art. 49. When Ms. Abbott brought\n  A. J. A. to Texas without permission from Mr. Abbott or the Chilean\n  family court, Mr. Abbott filed this suit in the Federal District Court,\n  seeking an order requiring his son\u2019s return to Chile under the Hague\n  Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction\n  (Convention) and the implementing statute, the International Child\n  Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a711601 et seq. Among\n  its provisions, the Convention seeks \u201cto secure the prompt return of\n  children wrongfully removed or retained in any Contracting State,\u201d\n  Art. 1; provides that such \u201cremoval or retention . . . is to be consid\n  ered wrongful where\u201d \u201cit is in breach of rights of custody attributed to\n  a person . . . under the law of the State in which the child was [there\n  tofore] habitually resident,\u201d Art. 3(a), and where \u201cthose rights [had\n  been] actually exercised . . . or would have been so exercised but for\n  the removal or retention,\u201d Art. 3(b); and defines \u201crights of custody\u201d to\n  \u201cinclude . . . the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence,\u201d Art.\n  5(a). The District Court denied relief, holding that the father\u2019s ne\n  exeat right did not constitute a \u201crigh[t] of custody\u201d under the Conven\n  tion and, thus, that the return remedy was not authorized. The Fifth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A parent has a right of custody under the Convention by reason of\n that parent\u2019s ne exeat right. Pp. 4\u201317.\n    (a) The Convention applies because A. J. A. is under 16; he was a\n2                          ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    habitual resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States are\n    contracting states. The ICARA instructs the state or federal court in\n    which a petition alleging international child abduction has been filed\n    to \u201cdecide the case in accordance with the Convention.\u201d \u00a7\u00a711603(b),\n    (d). P. 5.\n       (b) That A. J. A. was wrongfully removed from Chile in violation of\n    a \u201crigh[t] of custody\u201d is shown by the Convention\u2019s text, by the U. S.\n    State Department\u2019s views, by contracting states\u2019 court decisions, and\n    by the Convention\u2019s purposes. Pp. 5\u201318.\n         (1) Chilean law determines the content of Mr. Abbott\u2019s right,\n    while the Convention\u2019s text and structure resolve whether that right\n    is a \u201crigh[t] of custody.\u201d Minors Law 16,618, art. 49, provides that\n    \u201c[o]nce the court has decreed\u201d that one of the parents has visitation\n    rights, that parent\u2019s \u201cauthorization\u201d generally \u201cshall also be required\u201d\n    before the child may be taken out of the country. Because Mr. Abbott\n    has direct and regular visitation rights, it follows that he has a\n    ne exeat right under article 49. The Convention recognizes that cus\n    tody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), and Mr. Ab\n    bott\u2019s ne exeat right is best classified as a \u201cjoint right of custody,\u201d\n    which the Convention defines to \u201cinclude rights relating to the care of\n    the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the\n    child\u2019s place of residence,\u201d Art. 5(a). Mr. Abbott\u2019s right to decide\n    A. J. A.\u2019s country of residence allows him to \u201cdetermine the child\u2019s\n    place of residence,\u201d especially given the Convention\u2019s purpose to pre\n    vent wrongful removal across international borders. It also gives him\n    \u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child,\u201d in that choos\n    ing A. J. A.\u2019s residence country can determine the shape of his early\n    and adolescent years and his language, identity, and culture and tra\n    ditions. That a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional physical\n    custody notions is beside the point because the Convention\u2019s defini\n    tion of \u201crights of custody\u201d controls. This uniform, text-based ap\n    proach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Conven\n    tion, foreclosing courts from relying on local usage to undermine\n    recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries and under\n    other legal traditions. In any case, this country has adopted modern\n    conceptions of custody e.g., joint legal custody, that accord with the\n    Convention\u2019s broad definition. Ms. Abbott mistakenly claims that a\n    ne exeat right cannot qualify as a right of custody because the Con\n    vention requires that any such right be capable of \u201cexercis[e].\u201d When\n    one parent removes a child without seeking the ne exeat holder\u2019s con\n    sent, it is an instance where the right would have been \u201cexercised but\n    for the removal or retention,\u201d Art. 3(b). The Fifth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\n    that a breach of a ne exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy\n    would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nmost needed. Any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a right of access\nis atexual, as a ne exeat right is not even arguably a \u201cright to take a\nchild for a limited period of time.\u201d Art. 5(b). Ms. Abbott\u2019s argument\nthat the ne exeat order in this case cannot create a right of custody is\nnot dispositive because Mr. Abbott asserts rights under Minors Law\n16,618, which do not derive from the order. Pp. 6\u201311.\n     (2) This Court\u2019s conclusion is strongly supported and informed by\nthe longstanding view of the State Department\u2019s Office of Children\u2019s\nIssues, this country\u2019s Convention enforcement entity, that ne exeat\nrights are rights of custody. The Court owes deference to the Execu\ntive Branch\u2019s treaty interpretations. See Sumitomo Shoji America,\nInc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 185. There is no reason to doubt this\nwell-established canon here. The Executive, when dealing with deli\ncate foreign relations matters like international child abductions,\npossesses a great store of information on practical realities such as\nthe reactions from treaty partners to a particular treaty interpreta\ntion and the impact that interpretation may have on the State De\npartment\u2019s ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.\nPp. 11\u201312.\n     (3) The Court\u2019s view is also substantially informed by the views\nof sister contracting states on the issue, see El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd.\nv. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 176, particularly because the\nICARA directs that \u201cuniform international interpretation\u201d of the\nConvention is part of its framework, see \u00a711601(b)(3)(B). While the\nSupreme Court of Canada has reached an arguably contrary view,\nand French courts are divided, a review of the international law con\nfirms that courts and other legal authorities in England, Israel, Aus\ntria, South Africa, Germany, Australia, and Scotland have accepted\nthe rule that ne exeat rights are rights of custody within the Conven\ntion\u2019s meaning. Scholars agree that there is an emerging interna\ntional consensus on the matter. And the Convention\u2019s history is fully\nconsistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights are just one of the\nmany ways in which custody of children can be exercised. Pp. 12\u201316.\n     (4) The Court\u2019s holding also accords with the Convention\u2019s objects\nand purposes. There is no reason to doubt the ability of other con\ntracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best\ninterests of the children. To interpret the Convention to permit an\nabducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other par\nent holds a ne exeat right, runs counter to the Convention\u2019s purpose of\ndeterring child abductions to a country that provides a friendlier fo\nrum. Denying such a remedy would legitimize the very action, re\nmoval of the child, that the Convention was designed to prevent,\nwhile requiring return of the child in cases like this one helps deter\nabductions and respects the Convention\u2019s purpose to prevent harms\n4                           ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    to the child resulting from abductions. Pp. 16\u201318.\n      (c) While a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of custody\n    and may seek a return remedy, return will not automatically be or\n    dered if the abducting parent can establish the applicability of a Con\n    vention exception, such as \u201ca grave risk that . . . return would expose\n    the child to . . . harm or [an] otherwise . . . intolerable situation,\u201d or\n    the objection to removal by a child who has reached a sufficient \u201cage\n    and degree of maturity\u201d to state a preference, Art. 13(b).

I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\u201311. The\nUnited States is a contracting state to the Convention; and\nCongress has implemented its provisions through the\nInternational Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102\nStat. 437, 42 U. S. C. \u00a711601 et seq. The Convention\nprovides that a child abducted in violation of \u201crights of\ncustody\u201d must be returned to the child\u2019s country of habit\u00ad\nual residence, unless certain exceptions apply. Art. 1, S.\nTreaty Doc. No. 99\u201311, at 7 (Treaty Doc.). The question is\nwhether a parent has a \u201crigh[t] of custody\u201d by reason of\nthat parent\u2019s ne exeat right: the authority to consent before\nthe other parent may take the child to another country.\n                           I\n   Timothy Abbott and Jacquelyn Vaye Abbott married in\nEngland in 1992. He is a British citizen, and she is a\ncitizen of the United States. Mr. Abbott\u2019s astronomy\n2                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprofession took the couple to Hawaii, where their son\nA. J. A. was born in 1995. The Abbotts moved to La\nSerena, Chile, in 2002. There was marital discord, and\nthe parents separated in March 2003. The Chilean courts\ngranted the mother daily care and control of the child,\nwhile awarding the father \u201cdirect and regular\u201d visitation\nrights, including visitation every other weekend and for\nthe whole month of February each year. App. 9.\n  Chilean law conferred upon Mr. Abbott what is com\u00ad\nmonly known as a ne exeat right: a right to consent before\nMs. Abbott could take A. J. A. out of Chile. See Minors\nLaw 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a\n(granting a ne exeat right to any parent with visitation\nrights). In effect a ne exeat right imposes a duty on one\nparent that is a right in the other. After Mr. Abbott ob\u00ad\ntained a British passport for A. J. A., Ms. Abbott grew\nconcerned that Mr. Abbott would take the boy to Britain.\nShe sought and obtained a \u201cne exeat of the minor\u201d order\nfrom the Chilean family court, prohibiting the boy from\nbeing taken out of Chile.\n  In August 2005, while proceedings before the Chilean\ncourt were pending, the mother removed the boy from\nChile without permission from either the father or the\ncourt. A private investigator located the mother and the\nchild in Texas. In February 2006, the mother filed for\ndivorce in Texas state court. Part of the relief she sought\nwas a modification of the father\u2019s rights, including full\npower in her to determine the boy\u2019s place of residence and\nan order limiting the father to supervised visitation in\nTexas. This litigation remains pending.\n  Mr. Abbott brought an action in Texas state court,\nasking for visitation rights and an order requiring Ms.\nAbbott to show cause why the court should not allow Mr.\nAbbott to return to Chile with A. J. A. In February 2006,\nthe court denied Mr. Abbott\u2019s requested relief but granted\nhim \u201cliberal periods of possession\u201d of A. J. A. throughout\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFebruary 2006, provided Mr. Abbott remained in Texas.\nApp. 42.\n    In May 2006, Mr. Abbott filed the instant action in the\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas. He sought an order requiring his son\u2019s return to\nChile pursuant to the Convention and enforcement provi\u00ad\nsions of the ICARA. In July 2007, after holding a bench\ntrial during which only Mr. Abbott testified, the District\nCourt denied relief. The court held that the father\u2019s ne\nexeat right did not constitute a right of custody under the\nConvention and, as a result, that the return remedy was\nnot authorized. 495 F. Supp. 2d 635, 640.\n    The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed on the same rationale. The court held the father\npossessed no rights of custody under the Convention be\u00ad\ncause his ne exeat right was only \u201ca veto right over his\nson\u2019s departure from Chile.\u201d 542 F. 3d 1081, 1087 (2008).\nThe court expressed substantial agreement with the Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit in Croll v. Croll, 229\nF. 3d 133 (2000). Relying on American dictionary defini\u00ad\ntions of \u201ccustody\u201d and noting that ne exeat rights cannot be\n\u201c \u2018actually exercised\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the Conven\u00ad\ntion, Croll held that ne exeat rights are not rights of cus\u00ad\ntody. Id., at 138\u2013141 (quoting Art. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7).\nA dissenting opinion in Croll was filed by then-Judge\nSotomayor. The dissent maintained that a ne exeat right\nis a right of custody because it \u201cprovides a parent with\ndecisionmaking authority regarding a child\u2019s international\nrelocation.\u201d 229 F. 3d, at 146.\n    The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits\nadopted the conclusion of the Croll majority. See Fawcett\nv. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491, 500 (CA4 2003); Gonzalez v.\nGutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002). The Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit has followed the reason\u00ad\ning of the Croll dissent. Furnes v. Reeves, 362 F. 3d 702,\n720, n. 15 (2004). Certiorari was granted to resolve the\n4                       ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nconflict. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n  The Convention was adopted in 1980 in response to the\nproblem of international child abductions during domestic\ndisputes. The Convention seeks \u201cto secure the prompt\nreturn of children wrongfully removed to or retained in\nany Contracting State,\u201d and \u201cto ensure that rights of\ncustody and of access under the law of one Contracting\nState are effectively respected in the other Contracting\nStates.\u201d Art. 1, Treaty Doc., at 7.\n  The provisions of the Convention of most relevance at\nthe outset of this discussion are as follows:\n    \u201cArticle 3: The removal or the retention of the child is\n    to be considered wrongful where\u2014\n    \u201ca it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a\n    person, an institution or any other body, either jointly\n    or alone, under the law of the State in which the child\n    was habitually resident immediately before the re\u00ad\n    moval or retention; and\n    \u201cb at the time of removal or retention those rights\n    were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or\n    would have been so exercised but for the removal or\n    retention.\n        .           .               .          .       .\n    \u201cArticle 5: For the purposes of this Convention\u2014\n    \u201ca \u2018rights of custody\u2019 shall include rights relating to\n    the care of the person of the child and, in particular,\n    the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence;\n    \u201cb \u2018rights of access\u2019 shall include the right to take a\n    child for a limited period of time to a place other than\n    the child\u2019s habitual residence.\n        .           .               .          .       .\n    \u201cArticle 12: Where a child has been wrongfully re\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    moved or retained in terms of Article 3 . . . the author\u00ad\n    ity concerned shall order the return of the child\n    forthwith.\u201d Id., at 7, 9.\n   The Convention\u2019s central operating feature is the return\nremedy. When a child under the age of 16 has been\nwrongfully removed or retained, the country to which the\nchild has been brought must \u201corder the return of the child\nforthwith,\u201d unless certain exceptions apply. See, e.g., Arts.\n4, 12, ibid. A removal is \u201cwrongful\u201d where the child was\nremoved in violation of \u201crights of custody.\u201d The Conven\u00ad\ntion defines \u201crights of custody\u201d to \u201cinclude rights relating\nto the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the\nright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art.\n5(a), id., at 7. A return remedy does not alter the pre-ab\u00ad\nduction allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial\ndecisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence.\nArt. 19, id., at 11. The Convention also recognizes \u201crights\nof access,\u201d but offers no return remedy for a breach of\nthose rights. Arts. 5(b), 21, id., at 7, 11.\n   The United States has implemented the Convention\nthrough the ICARA. The statute authorizes a person who\nseeks a child\u2019s return to file a petition in state or federal\ncourt and instructs that the court \u201cshall decide the case in\naccordance with the Convention.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a711603(a),\n(b), (d). If the child in question has been \u201cwrongfully\nremoved or retained within the meaning of the Conven\u00ad\ntion,\u201d the child shall be \u201cpromptly returned,\u201d unless an\nexception is applicable. \u00a711601(a)(4).\n                            III\n  As the parties agree, the Convention applies to this\ndispute. A. J. A. is under 16 years old; he was a habitual\nresident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States\nare contracting states. The question is whether A. J. A.\nwas \u201cwrongfully removed\u201d from Chile, in other words,\nwhether he was removed in violation of a right of custody.\n6                    ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThis Court\u2019s inquiry is shaped by the text of the Conven\u00ad\ntion; the views of the United States Department of State;\ndecisions addressing the meaning of \u201crights of custody\u201d in\ncourts of other contracting states; and the purposes of the\nConvention. After considering these sources, the Court\ndetermines that Mr. Abbott\u2019s ne exeat right is a right of\ncustody under the Convention.\n                               A\n  \u201cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of\na statute, begins with its text.\u201d Medell\u00edn v. Texas, 552\nU. S. 491, 506 (2008). This Court consults Chilean law to\ndetermine the content of Mr. Abbott\u2019s right, while follow\u00ad\ning the Convention\u2019s text and structure to decide whether\nthe right at issue is a \u201crigh[t] of custody.\u201d\n  Chilean law granted Mr. Abbott a joint right to decide\nhis child\u2019s country of residence, otherwise known as a\nne exeat right. Minors Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 61a, 62a, provides that \u201c[o]nce the court has\ndecreed\u201d that one of the parents has visitation rights, that\nparent\u2019s \u201cauthorization . . . shall also be required\u201d before\nthe child may be taken out of the country, subject to court\noverride only where authorization \u201ccannot be granted or is\ndenied without good reason.\u201d Mr. Abbott has \u201cdirect and\nregular\u201d visitation rights and it follows from Chilean law,\nthat he has a shared right to determine his son\u2019s country\nof residence under this provision. App. 9. To support the\nconclusion that Mr. Abbott\u2019s right under Chilean law gives\nhim a joint right to decide his son\u2019s country of residence, it\nis notable that a Chilean agency has explained that Mi\u00ad\nnors Law 16,618 is a \u201cright to authorize the minors\u2019 exit\u201d\nfrom Chile and that this provision means that neither\nparent can \u201cunilaterally\u201d \u201cestablish the [child\u2019s] place of\nresidence.\u201d Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director\nGeneral, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region\nMetropolitana, to National Center for Missing and Ex\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Arribada Beaumont, No. 08\u2013775, pp.\n35a\u201337a, cert. pending.\n   The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be\ndecreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7;\nand Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to determine his son\u2019s country\nof residence is best classified as a joint right of custody, as\nthe Convention defines that term. The Convention defines\n\u201crights of custody\u201d to \u201cinclude rights relating to the care of\nthe person of the child and, in particular, the right to\ndetermine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art. 5(a), ibid.\nMr. Abbott\u2019s ne exeat right gives him both the joint \u201cright\nto determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d and joint\n\u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child.\u201d\n   Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to decide A. J. A.\u2019s country of\nresidence allows him to \u201cdetermine the child\u2019s place of\nresidence.\u201d The phrase \u201cplace of residence\u201d encompasses\nthe child\u2019s country of residence, especially in light of the\nConvention\u2019s explicit purpose to prevent wrongful removal\nacross international borders. See Convention Preamble,\nTreaty Doc., at 7. And even if \u201cplace of residence\u201d refers\nonly to the child\u2019s street address within a country, a\nne exeat right still entitles Mr. Abbott to \u201cdetermine\u201d that\nplace. \u201c[D]etermine\u201d can mean \u201c[t]o fix conclusively or\nauthoritatively,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n711 (2d ed. 1954) (2d definition), but it can also mean \u201c[t]o\nset bounds or limits to,\u201d ibid. (1st definition), which is\nwhat Mr. Abbott\u2019s ne exeat right allows by ensuring that\nA. J. A. cannot live at any street addresses outside of\nChile. It follows that the Convention\u2019s protection of a\nparent\u2019s custodial \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of\nresidence\u201d includes a ne exeat right.\n   Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to determine A. J. A.\u2019s country of\nresidence also gives him \u201crights relating to the care of the\nperson of the child.\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. Few\ndecisions are as significant as the language the child\n8                    ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nspeaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions\nshe will come to absorb. These factors, so essential to self\u00ad\ndefinition, are linked in an inextricable way to the child\u2019s\ncountry of residence. One need only consider the different\nchildhoods an adolescent will experience if he or she grows\nup in the United States, Chile, Germany, or North Korea,\nto understand how choosing a child\u2019s country of residence\nis a right \u201crelating to the care of the person of the child.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeals described Mr. Abbott\u2019s right to take\npart in making this decision as a mere \u201cveto,\u201d 542 F. 3d, at\n1087; but even by that truncated description, the father\nhas an essential role in deciding the boy\u2019s country of resi\u00ad\ndence. For example, Mr. Abbott could condition his con\u00ad\nsent to a change in country on A. J. A.\u2019s moving to a city\noutside Chile where Mr. Abbott could obtain an astronomy\nposition, thus allowing the father to have continued con\u00ad\ntact with the boy.\n   That a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional\nnotions of physical custody is beside the point. The Con\u00ad\nvention defines \u201crights of custody,\u201d and it is that definition\nthat a court must consult. This uniform, text-based ap\u00ad\nproach ensures international consistency in interpreting\nthe Convention. It forecloses courts from relying on defi\u00ad\nnitions of custody confined by local law usage, definitions\nthat may undermine recognition of custodial arrange\u00ad\nments in other countries or in different legal traditions,\nincluding the civil-law tradition. And, in any case, our\nown legal system has adopted conceptions of custody that\naccord with the Convention\u2019s broad definition. Joint legal\ncustody, in which one parent cares for the child while the\nother has joint decisionmaking authority concerning the\nchild\u2019s welfare, has become increasingly common. See\nSinger, Dispute Resolution and the Postdivorce Family:\nImplications of a Paradigm Shift, 47 Family Ct. Rev. 363,\n366 (2009) (\u201c[A] recent study of child custody outcomes in\nNorth Carolina indicated that almost 70% of all custody\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresolutions included joint legal custody, as did over 90% of\nall mediated custody agreements\u201d); E. Maccoby & R.\nMnookin, Dividing the Child: Social and Legal Dilemmas\nof Custody 107 (1992) (\u201c[F]or 79% of our entire sample, the\n[California] divorce decree provided for joint legal cus\u00ad\ntody\u201d); see generally Elrod, Reforming the System to Pro\u00ad\ntect Children in High Conflict Custody Cases, 28 Wm.\nMitchell L. Rev. 495, 505\u2013508 (2001).\n   Ms. Abbott gets the analysis backwards in claiming that\na ne exeat right is not a right of custody because the Con\u00ad\nvention requires that any right of custody must be capable\nof exercise. The Convention protects rights of custody\nwhen \u201cat the time of removal or retention those rights\nwere actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would\nhave been so exercised but for the removal or retention.\u201d\nArt. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7. In cases like this one, a\nne exeat right is by its nature inchoate and so has no\noperative force except when the other parent seeks to\nremove the child from the country. If that occurs, the\nparent can exercise the ne exeat right by declining consent\nto the exit or placing conditions to ensure the move will be\nin the child\u2019s best interests. When one parent removes the\nchild without seeking the ne exeat holder\u2019s consent, it is an\ninstance where the right would have been \u201cexercised but\nfor the removal or retention.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that a breach of a ne\nexeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would\nrender the Convention meaningless in many cases where\nit is most needed. The Convention provides a return\nremedy when a parent takes a child across international\nborders in violation of a right of custody. The Convention\nprovides no return remedy when a parent removes a child\nin violation of a right of access but requires contracting\nstates \u201cto promote the peaceful enjoyment of access\nrights.\u201d Art. 21, id., at 11. For example, a court may force\nthe custodial parent to pay the travel costs of visitation,\n10                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsee, e.g., Viragh v. Foldes, 415 Mass. 96, 109\u2013111, 612\nN. E. 2d 241, 249\u2013250 (1993), or make other provisions for\nthe noncustodial parent to visit his or her child, see\n\u00a711603(b) (authorizing petitions to \u201csecur[e] the effective\nexercise of rights of access to a child\u201d). But unlike rights\nof access, ne exeat rights can only be honored with a return\nremedy because these rights depend on the child\u2019s location\nbeing the country of habitual residence.\n   Any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a \u201crigh[t] of\naccess\u201d is illogical and atextual. The Convention defines\n\u201crights of access\u201d as \u201cinclud[ing] the right to take a child\nfor a limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s\nhabitual residence,\u201d Art. 5(b), Treaty Doc., at 7, and\nICARA defines that same term as \u201cvisitation rights,\u201d\n\u00a711602(7). The joint right to decide a child\u2019s country of\nresidence is not even arguably a \u201cright to take a child for a\nlimited period of time\u201d or a \u201cvisitation righ[t].\u201d Reaching\nthe commonsense conclusion that a ne exeat right does not\nfit these definitions of \u201crights of access\u201d honors the Con\u00ad\nvention\u2019s distinction between rights of access and rights of\ncustody.\n   Ms. Abbott argues that the ne exeat order in this case\ncannot create a right of custody because it merely protects\na court\u2019s jurisdiction over the child. Even if this argument\nwere correct, it would not be dispositive. Ms. Abbott\ncontends the Chilean court\u2019s ne exeat order contains no\nparental consent provision and so awards the father no\nrights, custodial or otherwise. See Brief for Respondent\n22; but see 495 F. Supp. 2d, at 638, n. 3 (the District Court\ntreating the order as containing a consent provision); 542\nF. 3d, at 1084 (same for the Court of Appeals). Even a\nne exeat order issued to protect a court\u2019s jurisdiction pend\u00ad\ning issuance of further decrees is consistent with allowing\na parent to object to the child\u2019s removal from the country.\nThis Court need not decide the status of ne exeat orders\nlacking parental consent provisions, however; for here the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfather relies on his rights under Minors Law 16,618. Mr.\nAbbott\u2019s rights derive not from the order but from Minors\nLaw 16,618. That law requires the father\u2019s consent before\nthe mother can remove the boy from Chile, subject only to\nthe equitable power family courts retain to override any\njoint custodial arrangements in times of disagreement.\nMinors Law 16,618; see 1 J. Atkinson, Modern Child\nCustody Practice \u00a76\u201311 (2d ed. 2009) (\u201c[T]he court remains\nthe final arbiter and may resolve the [dispute between\njoint custodians] itself or designate one parent as having\nfinal authority on certain issues affecting the child\u201d);\nLombardo v. Lombardo, 202 Mich. App. 151, 159, 507\nN. W. 2d 788, 792 (1993) (\u201c[W]here the parents as joint\ncustodians cannot agree on important matters such as\neducation, it is the court\u2019s duty to determine the issue in\nthe best interests of the child\u201d). The consent provision in\nMinors Law 16,618 confers upon the father the joint right\nto determine his child\u2019s country of residence. This is a\nright of custody under the Convention.\n                             B\n  This Court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Abbott possesses a\nright of custody under the Convention is supported and\ninformed by the State Department\u2019s view on the issue.\nThe United States has endorsed the view that ne exeat\nrights are rights of custody. In its brief before this Court\nthe United States advises that \u201cthe Department of State,\nwhose Office of Children\u2019s Issues serves as the Central\nAuthority for the United States under the Convention, has\nlong understood the Convention as including ne exeat\nrights among the protected \u2018rights of custody.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 21; see Sumitomo Shoji\nAmerica, Inc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184\u2013185, n. 10\n(1982) (deferring to the Executive\u2019s interpretation of a\ntreaty as memorialized in a brief before this Court). It is\nwell settled that the Executive Branch\u2019s interpretation of\n12                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na treaty \u201cis entitled to great weight.\u201d Id., at 185. There is\nno reason to doubt that this well-established canon of\ndeference is appropriate here. The Executive is well in\u00ad\nformed concerning the diplomatic consequences resulting\nfrom this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201crights of custody,\u201d\nincluding the likely reaction of other contracting states\nand the impact on the State Department\u2019s ability to re\u00ad\nclaim children abducted from this country.\n                              C\n  This Court\u2019s conclusion that ne exeat rights are rights of\ncustody is further informed by the views of other contract\u00ad\ning states. In interpreting any treaty, \u201c[t]he \u2018opinions of\nour sister signatories\u2019 . . . are \u2018entitled to considerable\nweight.\u2019 \u201d El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v.

The principle applies with special\nforce here, for Congress has directed that \u201cuniform inter\u00ad\nnational interpretation of the Convention\u201d is part of the\nConvention\u2019s framework. See \u00a711601(b)(3)(B).\n  A review of the international case law confirms broad\nacceptance of the rule that ne exeat rights are rights of\ncustody.

At that time, joint custodial\narrangements were unknown in many of the contracting\nstates, and the status of ne exeat rights was not yet well\nunderstood.

We need not\ndecide whether this Report should be given greater weight\nthan a scholarly commentary. Compare Hague Interna\u00ad\ntional Child Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analy\u00ad\nsis, 51 Fed. Reg. 10503\u201310506 (1986) (identifying the\nReport as the \u201cofficial history\u201d of the Convention and \u201ca\nsource of background on the meaning of the provisions of\nthe Convention\u201d), with P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b68, at 427\u2013428\n(\u201c[the Report] has not been approved by the Conference,\nand it is possible that, despite the Rapporter\u2019s [sic] efforts\nto remain objective, certain passages reflect a viewpoint\nwhich is in part subjective\u201d). It suffices to note that the\nReport supports the conclusion that ne exeat rights are\n16                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrights of custody. The Report explains that rather than\ndefining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws\nof different nations pertaining to parental rights, the\nConvention uses the unadorned term \u201crights of custody\u201d to\nrecognize \u201call the ways in which custody of children can be\nexercised\u201d through \u201ca flexible interpretation of the terms\nused, which allows the greatest possible number of cases\nto be brought into consideration.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b667, 71, at 446,\n447\u2013448. Thus the Report rejects the notion that because\nne exeat rights do not encompass the right to make medi\u00ad\ncal or some other important decisions about a child\u2019s life\nthey cannot be rights of custody. Indeed, the Report is\nfully consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights\nare just one of the many \u201cways in which custody of chil\u00ad\ndren can be exercised.\u201d Id., \u00b6 71, at 447.\n                              D\n   Adopting the view that the Convention provides a re\u00ad\nturn remedy for violations of ne exeat rights accords with\nits objects and purposes. The Convention is based on the\nprinciple that the best interests of the child are well\nserved when decisions regarding custody rights are made\nin the country of habitual residence. See Convention\nPreamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Ordering a return remedy\ndoes not alter the existing allocation of custody rights, Art.\n19, id., at 11, but does allow the courts of the home coun\u00ad\ntry to decide what is in the child\u2019s best interests. It is the\nConvention\u2019s premise that courts in contracting states will\nmake this determination in a responsible manner.\n   Custody decisions are often difficult. Judges must strive\nalways to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own\nsociety and culture, a tendency that ought not interfere\nwith objective consideration of all the factors that should\nbe weighed in determining the best interests of the child.\nThis judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of\nthe Convention, which affirms that the contracting states\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare \u201c[f]irmly convinced that the interests of children are of\nparamount importance in matters relating to their cus\u00ad\ntody.\u201d Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Interna\u00ad\ntional law serves a high purpose when it underwrites\nthe determination by nations to rely upon their domes\u00ad\ntic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair\nproceedings.\n   To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting\nparent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other\nparent holds a ne exeat right, would run counter to the\nConvention\u2019s purpose of deterring child abductions by\nparents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding\ncustodial disputes. Ms. Abbott removed A. J. A. from\nChile while Mr. Abbott\u2019s request to enhance his relation\u00ad\nship with his son was still pending before Chilean courts.\nAfter she landed in Texas, the mother asked the state\ncourt to diminish or eliminate the father\u2019s custodial and\nvisitation rights. The Convention should not be inter\u00ad\npreted to permit a parent to select which country will\nadjudicate these questions by bringing the child to a dif\u00ad\nferent country, in violation of a ne exeat right. Denying a\nreturn remedy for the violation of such rights would \u201cle\u00ad\ngitimize the very action\u2014removal of the child\u2014that the\nhome country, through its custody order [or other provi\u00ad\nsion of law], sought to prevent\u201d and would allow \u201cparents\nto undermine the very purpose of the Convention.\u201d Croll,\n229 F. 3d, at 147 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). This Court\nshould be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that\ngives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to\navoid a return remedy that is granted, for instance, in the\nUnited Kingdom, Israel, Germany, and South Africa. See\nsupra, at 12\u201313.\n   Requiring a return remedy in cases like this one helps\ndeter child abductions and respects the Convention\u2019s\npurpose to prevent harms resulting from abductions. An\nabduction can have devastating consequences for a child.\n18                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cSome child psychologists believe that the trauma children\nsuffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of\nchild abuse.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 103\u2013390, p. 2 (1993). A child\nabducted by one parent is separated from the second\nparent and the child\u2019s support system. Studies have\nshown that separation by abduction can cause psychologi\u00ad\ncal problems ranging from depression and acute stress\ndisorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and identity\u00ad\nformation issues. See N. Faulkner, Parental Child Abduc\u00ad\ntion is Child Abuse (1999), http://www.prevent-abuse\u00ad\nnow.com/unreport.htm (as visited May 13, 2010, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). A child abducted at\nan early age can experience loss of community and stabil\u00ad\nity, leading to loneliness, anger, and fear of abandonment.\nSee Huntington, Parental Kidnapping: A New Form of\nChild Abuse (1982), in American Prosecutors Research\nInstitute\u2019s National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse,\nParental Abduction Project, Investigation and Prosecution\nof Parental Abduction (1995) (App. A). Abductions may\nprevent the child from forming a relationship with the left\u00ad\nbehind parent, impairing the child\u2019s ability to mature. See\nFaulkner, supra, at 5.\n                              IV\n   While a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of\ncustody and may seek a return remedy, a return order is\nnot automatic. Return is not required if the abducting\nparent can establish that a Convention exception applies.\nOne exception states return of the child is not required\nwhen \u201cthere is a grave risk that his or her return would\nexpose the child to physical or psychological harm or\notherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\u201d Art.\n13(b), Treaty Doc., at 10. If, for example, Ms. Abbott could\ndemonstrate that returning to Chile would put her own\nsafety at grave risk, the court could consider whether this\nis sufficient to show that the child too would suffer \u201cpsy\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The Convention also allows courts to decline\nto order removal if the child objects, if the child has\nreached a sufficient \u201cage and degree of maturity at which\nit is appropriate to take account of its views.\u201d Art. 13(b),\nTreaty Doc., at 10.

J. A., has no\nauthority to decide whether his son undergoes a particular\nmedical procedure; whether his son attends a school field\ntrip; whether and in what manner his son has a religious\nupbringing; or whether his son can play a videogame\nbefore he completes his homework. These are all rights\nand responsibilities of A. J. A.\u2019s mother, respondent Jac\u00ad\nquelyn Abbott. It is she who received sole custody, or\n\u201cdaily care and control,\u201d of A. J. A. when the expatriate\ncouple divorced while living in Chile in 2004. 495 F. Supp.\n2d 635, 637, and n. 2 (WD Tex. 2007). Mr. Abbott pos\u00ad\nsesses only visitation rights.\n   On Ms. Abbott\u2019s custodial rights, Chilean law placed a\nrestriction: She was not to travel with her son outside of\nChile without either Mr. Abbott\u2019s or the court\u2019s consent.\nPut differently, Mr. Abbott had the opportunity to veto\nMs. Abbott\u2019s decision to remove A. J. A. from Chile unless\na Chilean court overrode that veto. The restriction on\nA. J. A.\u2019s and Ms. Abbott\u2019s travel was an automatic, de\u00ad\nfault provision of Chilean law operative upon the award of\nvisitation rights under Article 48 of Chile\u2019s Minors Law\n16,618. It is this travel restriction\u2014also known as a ne\nexeat clause\u2014that the Court today declares is a \u201c \u2018righ[t] of\n2                        ABBOTT v.

I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty\nDoc. No. 99\u201311. Ante, at 1.\n  Because the Court concludes that this travel restriction\nconstitutes a right of custody, and because Ms. Abbott\nindisputably violated the restriction when she took A. J. A.\nfrom Chile without either Mr. Abbott\u2019s or the court\u2019s per\u00ad\nmission, Mr. Abbott is now entitled to the return of\nA. J. A. to Chile under the terms of the Convention. Thus,\nabsent a finding of an exception to the Convention\u2019s pow\u00ad\nerful return remedy, see ante, at 18\u201319, and even if the\nreturn is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests, an Ameri\u00ad\ncan court must now order the return of A. J. A. to Mr.\nAbbott, who has no legal authority over A. J. A., based\nsolely on his possessing a limited veto power over Ms.\nAbbott\u2019s ability to take A. J. A. from Chile. As I shall\nexplain, use of the Convention\u2019s return remedy under\nthese circumstances is contrary to the Convention\u2019s text\nand purpose.\n                                I\n   When the drafters of the Convention gathered in 1980,\nthey sought an international solution to an emerging\nproblem: transborder child abductions perpetrated by\nnoncustodial parents \u201cto establish artificial jurisdictional\nlinks . . . with a view to obtaining custody of a child.\u201d 1980\nConf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\u00e9,\nEnl\u00e8vement d\u2019enfants, E.

The drafters\u2019 primary concern\nwas to remedy abuses by noncustodial parents who at\u00ad\ntempt to circumvent adverse custody decrees (e.g., those\ngranting sole custodial rights to the other parent) by\nseeking a more favorable judgment in a second nation\u2019s\nfamily court system. P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b614, at 429.\n   The drafters determined that when a noncustodial\nparent abducts a child across international borders, the\nbest remedy is return of that child to his or her country of\nhabitual residence\u2014or, in other words, the best remedy is\nreturn of the child to his or her custodial parent. Id., \u00b618,\nat 430. The drafters concluded that the same remedy\nshould not follow, however, when a custodial parent takes\na child from his or her country of habitual residence in\nbreach of the other parent\u2019s visitation rights, or \u201crights of\naccess\u201d in the Convention\u2019s parlance. Id., \u00b665, at 444\u2013445.\nThe distinction between rights of custody and rights of\naccess, therefore, is critically important to the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s scheme and purpose. It defines the scope of the\navailable Convention remedies.\n   Article 5 defines these rights as follows:\n    \u201cFor the purposes of this Convention\u2014\n    \u201ca \u2018rights of custody\u2019 shall include rights relating to\n    the care of the person of the child and, in particular,\n    the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence;\n    \u201cb \u2018rights of access\u2019 shall include the right to take a\n    child for a limited period of time to a place other than\n    the child\u2019s habitual residence.\u201d S.

ABBOTT\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nArticle 3 of the Convention provides that the removal or\nretention of a child is \u201cwrongful,\u201d and thus in violation of\nthe Convention, only when the removal \u201cis in breach of the\nrights of custody.\u201d Art. 3(a), ibid. The fact that a removal\nmay be \u201cwrongful\u201d in the sense that it violates domestic\nlaw or violates only \u201crights of access\u201d does not make it\n\u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of the Convention.\n   Only when a removal is \u201cwrongful\u201d under Article 3 may\nthe parent who possesses custody rights force the child\u2019s\nreturn to the country of habitual residence under the\nConvention\u2019s remedial procedures, pursuant to Articles 8\nthrough 20. For those removals that frustrate a noncusto\u00ad\ndial parent\u2019s \u201crights of access,\u201d the Convention provides\nthat the noncustodial parent may file an application \u201cto\nmake arrangements for organizing or securing the effec\u00ad\ntive exercise of rights of access\u201d; but he may not force the\nchild\u2019s return. Art. 21, id., at 11. A parent without \u201crights\nof custody,\u201d therefore, does not have the power granted by\nArticle 3 to compel the child\u2019s return to his or her country\nof habitual residence. His rights are limited to those set\nforth in Article 21.\n                             II\n  Mr. Abbott, claiming \u201crights of custody\u201d by virtue of the\ntravel restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott, seeks\nthe return of A. J. A. to Chile. Such relief is warranted\nonly if A. J. A.\u2019s removal was \u201cwrongful\u201d within the mean\u00ad\ning of the Convention; as such, it must have been \u201cin\nbreach of [Mr. Abbott\u2019s] rights of custody.\u201d2 Art. 3, id., at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Indisputably,\n                  Ms. Abbott\u2019s removal of A. J. A. from Chile was wrong\u00ad\nful in the generic sense of the word. She violated Chilean law when she\ntook A. J. A. to Texas because she sought neither Mr. Abbott\u2019s permis\u00ad\nsion nor the court\u2019s authorization before doing so. She violated both the\nexisting \u201cne exeat\u201d order imposed by judicial decree in the couple\u2019s\ncustody dispute, see ante, at 2, as well as Chilean statutory law defin\u00ad\ning the access rights of noncustodial parents, see Art. 49, Minors Law\n16,618, App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The removal was illegal, then, but it\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                       5\n\n                          STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n7. Putting aside the effect of the travel restriction, it is\nundisputed that Ms. Abbott possesses \u201crights of custody\u201d\nover A. J. A. while Mr. Abbott would possess \u201crights of\naccess,\u201d as those terms are used in the Convention. Brief\nfor Petitioner 6; Brief for Respondent 6. The only issue in\nthis case, therefore, is whether Mr. Abbott also possesses\n\u201crights of custody\u201d within the meaning of the Convention\nby virtue of the travel restriction, or ne exeat clause,3 that\nChilean law imposes on Ms. Abbott. In other words, the\nquestion is whether the \u201cright\u201d of one parent to veto the\nother parent\u2019s decision to remove a child from the country,\nsubject to judicial override, belongs in the category of\n\u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child and,\nin particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of\nresidence.\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. In my judgment,\nit clearly does not, and I need look no further than to the\nConvention\u2019s text to explain why. See Medell\u00edn v. Texas,\n552 U. S. 491, 506 (2008) (\u201cThe interpretation of a treaty,\nlike the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text\u201d).\n   Rights relating to the care of the child. The Court con\u00ad\ncludes that the veto power Mr. Abbott has over Ms. Ab\u00ad\nbott\u2019s travel plans is equivalent to those rights \u201c \u2018relating\nto the care of the person of the child.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 7\u20138. This\nis so, the Court tells us, because Mr. Abbott has a limited\npower to keep A. J. A. within Chile\u2019s bounds and, there\u00ad\nfore, indirectly to influence \u201cthe language the child speaks,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwas only wrongful within the meaning of the Convention if it was in\nbreach of Mr. Abbott\u2019s rights of custody. Unfortunately, I fear the\nCourt\u2019s preoccupation with deterring parental misconduct\u2014even,\npotentially, at the sake of the best interests of the child\u2014has caused it\nto minimize this important distinction.\n  3 The Court repeatedly refers to \u201cne exeat rights,\u201d ante, at 3, 10, 11,\n\n12, 14, 15, and 16, as if the single travel restriction at issue in this case\nwere on a par with the multiple rights commonly exercised by custodial\nparents. Chile\u2019s statutory ne exeat provision is better characterized as\na restriction on the travel of both the minor and the custodial parent\nthan as a bundle of \u201crights\u201d possessed by the noncustodial parent.\n6                    ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe identity he finds, or the culture and traditions she will\ncome to absorb.\u201d Ante, at 7. It is not nearly as self-evident\nas the Court assumes that Mr. Abbott\u2019s veto power carries\nwith it any ability to decide the language A. J. A. speaks\nor the cultural experiences he will have, ante, at 7\u20138. A. J.\nA.\u2019s mere presence in Chile does not determine any num\u00ad\nber of issues, including: whether A. J. A. learns Spanish\nwhile there; whether he attends an American school or a\nBritish school or a local school; whether he participates in\nsports; whether he is raised Catholic or Jewish or Bud\u00ad\ndhist or atheist; whether he eats a vegetarian diet; and on\nand on. The travel restriction does not confer upon Mr.\nAbbott affirmative power to make any number of decisions\nthat are vital to A. J. A.\u2019s physical, psychological, and\ncultural development. To say that a limited power to veto\na child\u2019s travel plans confers, also, a right \u201crelating to the\ncare\u201d of that child devalues the great wealth of decisions a\ncustodial parent makes on a daily basis to attend to a\nchild\u2019s needs and development.\n  The Court\u2019s interpretation depends entirely on a broad\nreading of the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d in the Convention\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201crights of custody.\u201d It is, undeniably, broad\nlanguage. But, as the Court reads the term, it is so broad\nas to be utterly unhelpful in interpreting what \u201crights of\ncustody\u201d means. We \u201ccannot forget that we ultimately are\ndetermining the meaning of the term\u201d rights of custody in\nthis case, and we should not lose sight of the import of this\nterm in construing the broad words that follow in its wake.\nLeocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004). I suppose it\ncould be said that Mr. Abbott\u2019s ability to decide whether\nA. J. A. spends the night with one of his friends during a\nSaturday visit is also a \u201cright relating to the care of the\nchild.\u201d Taken in the abstract\u2014and to its most absurd\u2014\nany decision on behalf of a child could be construed as a\nright \u201crelating to\u201d the care of a child.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  Such a view of the text obliterates the careful distinction\nthe drafters drew between the rights of custody and the\nrights of access. Undoubtedly, they were aware of the\nconcept of joint custody. See P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b671, at\n457 (\u201c[C]ustody rights may have been awarded . . . to that\nperson in his own right or jointly. It cannot be otherwise\nin an era when types of joint custody, regarded as best\nsuited to the general principle of sexual non\u00ad\ndiscrimination, are gradually being introduced into inter\u00ad\nnal law\u201d). But just because rights of custody can be shared\nby two parents, it does not follow that the drafters in\u00ad\ntended this limited veto power to be a right of custody.\nAnd yet this, it seems, is how the Court understands the\ncase: Because the drafters intended to account for joint\ncustodial arrangements, they intended for this travel\nrestriction to be joint custody because it could be said, in\nsome abstract sense, to relate to care of the child. I fail to\nunderstand how the Court\u2019s reading is faithful to the\nConvention\u2019s text and purpose, given that the text ex\u00ad\npressly contemplates two distinct classes of parental\nrights. Today\u2019s decision converts every noncustodial par\u00ad\nent with access rights\u2014at least in Chile\u2014into a custodial\nparent for purposes of the Convention.\n  On this point, it is important to observe the effect of the\nCourt\u2019s decision to classify the travel restriction as a right\n\u201crelating to\u201d A. J. A.\u2019s care. Mr. Abbott possesses no legal\nauthority presently to exercise care or control of A. J. A.,\nor to make decisions on his behalf. The Court would nev\u00ad\nertheless read the Convention to require A. J. A.\u2019s return\nto a parent without such rights merely because the travel\nrestriction, in an abstract sense, could be said to relate to\nA. J. A.\u2019s care. The Court fails to explain how a parent\nwho otherwise possesses no legal authority to exercise\n\u201ccharge,\u201d \u201csupervision,\u201d or \u201cmanagement\u201d over a child, see\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 338 (1986)\n(hereinafter Webster\u2019s) (5th definition of \u201ccare\u201d), can be\u00ad\n8                    ABBOTT v.

The\nCourt also concludes that Mr. Abbott\u2019s veto power satisfies\nthe Convention\u2019s definition of custodial rights because it\nis, in the Court\u2019s view, a \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s\nplace of residence.\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. I disagree\nwith the Court\u2019s assessment of the significance and mean\u00ad\ning of this phrase, both on its face and within the context\nof the Convention\u2019s other provisions.\n   As an initial matter, the Court\u2019s reading of the Conven\u00ad\ntion depends on isolating the phrase \u201cand, in particular,\nthe right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d to\nrefer to a freestanding right separate and apart from the\nrights related to the care of the child. I do not agree with\nthis view of the text, nor did the Convention\u2019s drafters:\n    \u201cThe Convention seeks to be more precise by empha\u00ad\n    sizing, as an example of the \u2018care\u2019 referred to [in the\n    \u201c \u2018rights of custody\u2019 \u201d clause, Art. 5(a)], the right to de\u00ad\n    termine the child\u2019s place of residence. However, if the\n    child, although still a minor at law, has the right itself\n    to determine its own place of residence, the substance\n    of the custody rights will have to be determined in the\n    context of other rights concerning the person of the\n    child.\u201d P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b684, at 452 (emphasis\n    added).\n   The drafters thus intended the \u201cright to determine the\nchild\u2019s place of residence\u201d to be an \u201cexample\u201d of what the\nConvention means by \u201ccare of the person of the child.\u201d It\nis indicative of the \u201csubstance\u201d of what it means to be a\ncustodial parent. The definition is not, as the Court would\nhave it, one stick in the bundle that may be parsed as a\nsingular \u201c \u2018righ[t] of custody,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 1; rather, it is a\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

The parent responsible for determining where\nand with whom a child resides, the drafters assumed,\nwould likely also be the parent who has the responsibility\nto \u201ccare\u201d for the child.\n   Yet even assuming, as the Court does, that the \u201cright to\ndetermine the child\u2019s place of residence,\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty\nDoc., at 7, is divisible from the \u201ccare\u201d of the child, ibid., I\nstill fail to understand how a travel restriction on one\nparent\u2019s exercise of her custodial rights is equivalent to an\naffirmative \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of resi\u00ad\ndence.\u201d Analyzing its text, in the context of the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s focus on distinguishing custodial parents from non\u00ad\ncustodial ones, leads me to conclude that the \u201cright to\ndetermine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d means the power\nto set or fix the location of the child\u2019s home. It does not\nrefer to the more abstract power to keep a child within one\nnation\u2019s borders.\n   \u201cTo determine\u201d means \u201cto fix conclusively or authorita\u00ad\ntively\u201d or \u201cto settle a question or controversy.\u201d4 Webster\u2019s\n616. A \u201cplace\u201d is a \u201cphysical environment\u201d or \u201ca building\nor locality used for a special purpose.\u201d Id., at 1727. \u201cResi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 \u201cTo determine\u201d can also mean, as the Court observes, \u201c \u2018to set\n\nbounds or limits to,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 7 (quoting Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary 711 (2d ed. 1954) (1st definition) (hereinafter Webster\u2019s 2d)).\nHowever, this definition of \u201cto determine\u201d makes little functional sense\nas applied to this treaty. In the context of understanding the meaning\nof rights of custody, the phrase \u201cto determine\u201d cannot be so indetermi\u00ad\nnate as to merely set \u201climits to\u201d a child\u2019s place of residence.\n      Although the Court emphasizes that the definition of \u201cto deter\u00ad\nmine\u201d on which it relies is the first such entry in Webster\u2019s, ante, at 7, it\nis worth noting that surely the Court would not rely on the first such\ndefinition of the word \u201ccare\u201d in that source (\u201csuffering of mind; grief;\nsorrow\u201d) to understand the Convention\u2019s use of that word. See Web\u00ad\nster\u2019s 2d, at 405. Instead, the fifth definition of that word\u2014\u201ccharge,\nsupervision, management\u201d\u2014is clearly the relevant one. The point is\nonly that context, as well as common sense, matters when selecting\namong possible definitions.\n10                       ABBOTT v.

In\nthe law, \u201cresidence\u201d can mean: \u201c[t]he act or fact of living in\na given place for some time\u201d; \u201c[t]he place where one actu\u00ad\nally lives\u201d; or, \u201c[a] house or other fixed abode; a dwelling.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1423 (9th ed. 2009).5 Lay defini\u00ad\ntions of \u201cresidence\u201d similarly describe a specific location:\n\u201cthe act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some\ntime\u201d; \u201cthe place where one actually lives or has his\nhome\u201d; or, \u201ca temporary or permanent dwelling place,\nabode, or habitation.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1931. It follows that a\n\u201cplace of residence\u201d describes a \u201cphysical\u201d location in\nwhich a child \u201cactually lives.\u201d\n   The Court\u2019s reading of this text depends on its substitu\u00ad\ntion of the word \u201ccountry\u201d for the word \u201cplace.\u201d Such a\nsubstitution is not illogical, of course, in light of the Con\u00ad\nvention\u2019s international focus. See Croll v. Croll, 229 F. 3d\n133, 147, 148 (CA2 2000) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (read\u00ad\ning \u201cplace of residence\u201d to mean \u201cauthority over the child\u2019s\nmore specific living arrangements\u201d \u201cignores the basic\ninternational character of the Hague Convention\u201d). But it\nis inconsistent with the Convention\u2019s text and purpose.\n   When the drafters wanted to refer to country, they did.\nFor example, in Article 3, the drafters explained that\nrights of custody should be defined by looking to \u201cthe law\nof the State in which the child was habitually resident.\u201d\nArt. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. Had the drafters intended the\ndefinition of the child\u2019s \u201cplace of residence\u201d in Article 5 to\nrefer to his or her \u201cState\u201d or country of \u201cresidence,\u201d they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 \u201cResidence\u201d can also refer to \u201c[t]he place where a corporation or\n\nother enterprise does business or is registered to do business.\u201d Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1423.

The point is: When the drafters\nwanted to refer to a particular geographic unit, they\ndid so.\n    Instead, the drafters elected the formulation \u201cplace of\nresidence,\u201d which is also utilized similarly in the definition\nof \u201crights of access.\u201d See Art. 5(b), id., at 7 (defining\n\u201c \u2018rights of access\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cthe right to take a child for\na limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s\nhabitual residence\u201d (emphasis added)). And they utilized\nthis phrase only within one particular Article, as opposed\nto their more frequent use of \u201cState of habitual residence\u201d\nthroughout the Convention. In interpreting statutory\ntext, we ordinarily presume that the use of different words\nis purposeful and evinces an intention to convey a differ\u00ad\nent meaning. See, e.g., Russello v.

We would not presume to ascribe this\ndifference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship\u201d). There\nis no reason we should presume otherwise in the context of\ntreaties.\n   Accordingly, I would give \u201cplace of residence\u201d the loca\u00ad\ntion-specific meaning its plain text connotes, irrespective\nof the fact that this Convention concerns international\nabduction. The right described by the Convention is the\nright to decide, conclusively, where a child\u2019s home will be.\nAnd this makes a good deal of sense. The child lives with\nthe parent who has custodial rights or, in the language of\nthe Convention, \u201ccare of the person of the child,\u201d Art. 5(a),\nTreaty Doc., at 7. The child\u2019s home\u2014his or her \u201cplace of\nresidence\u201d\u2014is fixed by the custody arrangement.7 This\ncomports too with the Convention\u2019s decision to privilege\nthe rights of custodians over the rights of those parents\nwith only visitation rights.\n   Understanding the effect of a travel restriction. So, the\nquestion we confront is whether a travel restriction on one\nparent\u2019s right to embark on international travel with his\nor her child creates in the other parent a \u201cright to deter\u00ad\nmine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d or the ability \u201cto fix\nconclusively\u201d the child\u2019s \u201cphysical\u201d \u201chome.\u201d Before answer\u00ad\ning this question, it is important to understand the nature\nof the travel restriction we must classify.\n   The departure of a minor from Chile\u2014including when\nthat child lives in a married, two-parent household\u2014is\ngoverned by Article 49 of \u00a716,618 of that country\u2019s Minors\nLaw. Under Chilean law, no minor is allowed outside of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 I do not mean to suggest by my view of the significance of a travel\n\nrestriction that there could not be a custody arrangement in which both\nparents have the \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d\nArt. 5(a), id., at 7. My view is only that the type of ne exeat provision at\nissue in this case does not, by itself, confer such an affirmative right.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

But the statute further\nprovides that if the noncustodial parent has been granted\nvisitation rights, the authorization of the parent with\nvisitation rights shall also be required: \u201cOnce the court\nhas decreed the obligation to allow visits pursuant to the\npreceding article,[8] authorization of the father or mother\nwho has the right to visit a child shall also be required.\u201d\nIbid. (footnote added). The statute provides, also, an\nimportant backstop in the event a noncustodial parent\ndenies authorization \u201cwithout good reason\u201d: A Chilean\ncourt may grant the minor or his parent permission to\nleave the country. Id., at 62a. Finally, if the custodial\nparent does not return the child to Chile within the time\nauthorized, \u201cthe judge may decree the suspension of ali\u00ad\nmony that may have been decreed.\u201d Ibid.\n  Returning, then, to the question at hand: By virtue of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The \u201cpreceding article\u201d referred to, Article 48, simply provides:\n\n\u201cEach time a minor is entrusted to one of the parents or a third person,\nsuch decision must include the obligation to allow the non-custodial\nparent to exercise his or her right to visit.

A. \u201cactually lives or\nhas his home.\u201d See supra, at 9\u201310. True, the travel re\u00ad\nstriction bestows upon the noncustodial parent a limited\npower to prevent his child from leaving the country with\u00ad\nout his permission, but it does not grant an affirmative\npower to fix or set the location of the child\u2019s home. Mr.\nAbbott has no power whatever to determine where A. J. A.\nactually lives within the nearly 300,000 square miles that\ncompose Chile. Even more important, Mr. Abbott has no\npower whatever to select another country in which A. J. A.\nwould live, were Mr. Abbott\u2019s work to take him to another\ncountry altogether. In sum, a right to object to a proposed\ndeparture gives a parent far less authority than a right to\ndetermine where the child shall reside. Moreover, the\nright to determine where to live within a country, as well\nas what country to live in, is far broader than the limited\nright to object to a child\u2019s travel abroad.\n  In my view, the \u201cright\u201d Mr. Abbott has by virtue of the\ntravel restriction is therefore best understood as relating\nto his \u201crights of access,\u201d as the Convention defines that\nterm\u2014and not as a standalone \u201c \u2018righ[t] of custody,\u2019 \u201d as the\nCourt defines it, ante, at 1. Chile\u2019s statutory travel re\u00ad\nstriction provision is plainly ancillary to the access rights\nthe Chilean family court granted to him as the noncusto\u00ad\ndial parent. By its terms, the obligation on the custodial\nparent to seek the other parent\u2019s permission before remov\u00ad\ning the child from Chile only operates upon the award of\nvisitation rights; it has nothing to do with custody rights.\nAnd it operates automatically to facilitate the noncusto\u00ad\ndial parent\u2019s ability to access the child and to exercise his\nvisitation rights. In the best of all possible circumstances,\nMr. Abbott\u2019s limited veto power assures him relatively\neasy access to A. J. A. so that he may continue a meaning\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

But this power, standing\nalone, does not transform him into a custodian for pur\u00ad\nposes of the Convention\u2019s return remedy. Instead, it au\u00ad\nthorizes him, pursuant to Article 21, to seek assistance\nfrom this country in carrying out the Chilean family\ncourt\u2019s visitation order.\n                              III\n  Although the Court recognizes, as it must, that \u201c \u2018[t]he\ninterpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a\nstatute, begins with its text,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 6 (quoting Medell\u00edn,\n552 U. S., at 506), the Court\u2019s analysis is atextual\u2014at\nleast as far as the Convention\u2019s text goes. The Court first\nrelies on the text of the Chilean law at issue and a single\nChilean administrator\u2019s alleged interpretation thereof.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Because   differences in statutory provisions, as well as cultural\ndifferences and personal predilections, may affect the opinions of local\nofficials, I would attach no weight to the letter from Paula Strap\nCamus, describing Article 49 of Chile\u2019s Minors Law 16,618 as establish\u00ad\ning a shared right to determine the place of residence of a child.\nMoreover, we have no obligation to defer, on questions of treaty inter\u00ad\npretation, to the nonjudicial decisions of another signatory state, let\nalone a return request\u2014a piece of advocacy\u2014filed on behalf of Chile in\nanother case.\n   In any event, the letter cited offers much less support for the Court\u2019s\nposition than meets the eye.

In other words, Ms. Camus\u2019\nletter request for the child\u2019s return in that case depends on a provision\nof Article 49 not at issue in this case: \u201cIf the custody of a legitimate\nchild has not been entrusted by the judge to any of his parents or to a\nthird party, the child may not leave without authorization of both\nparents.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.

While it is true that the meaning of Chile\u2019s\nstatute matters to our determining whether a parent has\ntaken a child in \u201cbreach of rights of custody . . . under the\nlaw of the State in which the child was habitually resident\nimmediately before the removal or retention,\u201d Art. 3(a),\nTreaty Doc., at 7, it does not and should not inform what\nthe Convention\u2019s definition of \u201crights of custody\u201d means in\nthe first place.\n  The Court also reminds us that the Convention\u2019s terms\nare to be broadly construed. See ante, at 15\u201316. To be\nsure, the Convention\u2019s leading interpretive authority\ninforms us that the Convention\u2019s understanding of what\nconstitutes \u201crights of custody\u201d is broad and flexible. See\nP\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b6\u00b667, 71, 84, at 446, 447, 451\u2013452.\nAnd we are to apply its terms to \u201callo[w] the greatest\npossible number of cases to be brought into consideration.\u201d\nId., \u00b667, at 446. But such breadth should not circumvent\nthe Convention\u2019s text in order to sweep a travel restriction\nunder the umbrella of rights of custody.\n  A reading as broad and flexible as the Court\u2019s eviscer\u00ad\nates the distinction the Convention draws between rights\nof custody and rights of access. Indeed, the Court\u2019s read\u00ad\ning essentially voids the Convention\u2019s Article 21, which\nprovides a separate remedy for breaches of rights of ac\u00ad\ncess. If a violation of this type of provision were not a\nbreach of the rights of access, I find it quite difficult to\nimagine what the Convention\u2019s drafters had in mind when\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthere may be a sound basis for distinguishing the legal effect and\nsignificance of a travel restriction in effect prior to an award of custody\nto either or both parents, from one that occurs ancillary to the award of\nvisitation rights to a parent who has no custodial rights. Moreover, the\nU. S. Department of State, at the time the Convention was ratified,\nbelieved that the Convention would require return in these circum\u00ad\nstances: \u201cChildren who are wrongfully removed or retained prior to the\nentry of a custody order are protected by the Convention. There need\nnot be a custody order in effect in order to invoke the Convention\u2019s\nreturn provisions.\u201d Convention Analysis 10505.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

The drafters obviously contemplated that\nsome removals might be in violation of the law of the\nchild\u2019s home nation, but not \u201cwrongful\u201d within the mean\u00ad\ning of the Convention\u2014i.e., not in breach of \u201crights of\ncustody.\u201d This is precisely why Article 5 carefully deline\u00ad\nates between the two types of parental rights in the first\nplace. And this is precisely why Article 21 exists.\n   Nevertheless, the Court has now decreed that whenever\nan award of visitation rights triggers a statutory default\ntravel restriction provision, or is accompanied by a travel\nrestriction by judicial order, a parent possess a right of\ncustody within the meaning of the Convention. Such a\nbright-line rule surely will not serve the best interests of\nthe child in many cases. See P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b625, at\n432. It will also have surprising results. In Chile, for\nexample, as a result of this Court\u2019s decision, all parents\u2014\nso long as they have the barest of visitation rights\u2014now\nalso have joint custody within the meaning of the Conven\u00ad\ntion and the right to utilize the return remedy.10\n   It bears emphasis that such a result\u2014treating the type\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 In 2003, the latest year for which statistics appear available,\n\nChile\u2019s Central Authority, which is the entity responsible for adminis\u00ad\ntering its obligations under the Hague Convention, made five outgoing\n\u201caccess applications\u201d under Article 21.

It is plain that\neven Chilean officials have not thought correct the Court\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of the intersection of the travel restriction in Article 49 of its\nMinors Law 16,618 and the Convention.\n18                      ABBOTT v.

A question\u00ad\n       able result would have been attained had the applica\u00ad\n       tion of the Convention, by granting the same degree of\n       protection to custody and access rights, led ultimately\n       to the substitution of the holders of one type of right by\n       those who held the other.\u201d Id., \u00b665, at 445 (emphasis\n       added; footnote omitted).\nIt seems the very same authority on which the Court\nrelies to support its broad, flexible reading of the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s terms also tell us that the drafters expressly rejected\nthe very outcome the Court reaches today.

In this case,\nit appears that both are true: The Department of State\u2019s\nposition, which supports the Court\u2019s conclusion, is newly\nmemorialized, see Brief for United States as Amicus Cu\u00ad\nriae 21, n. 13, and is possibly inconsistent with the De\u00ad\npartment\u2019s earlier position, see Convention Analysis\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 See Art. 32, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23,\n\n1969, 1155 U.

This does not seem\nto be a matter in which deference to the Executive on\nmatters of foreign policy would avoid international con\u00ad\nflict, cf. Itel Containers Int\u2019l Corp. v.

Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S.\n159, 196 (1983))); the State Department has made no such\nargument. Nor is this a case in which the Executive\u2019s\nunderstanding of the treaty\u2019s drafting history is particu\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The State Department explained to the Senate at the time it sought\n\nratification of the Convention that the \u201cfundamental purpose of the\nHague Convention\u201d was \u201cto protect children from wrongful interna\u00ad\ntional removals or retentions by persons bent on obtaining their physi\u00ad\ncal and/or legal custody.\u201d Convention Analysis 10504. I find it quite\nunlikely, in light of its framing of the \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of the\nConvention, that the State Department would have agreed at the time\nthat a removal was \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of the Convention\nwhen a parent with physical custody of a child took that child to an\u00ad\nother country, even when that removal was in violation of a restriction\non the custodial parent\u2019s travel rights. See also Brief for Eleven Law\nProfessors as Amici Curiae 4\u20135, n. 7. Even more telling, however, is\nthe fact that, in a response to a questionnaire used by the Convention\u2019s\ndrafters in preparing the treaty, the United States characterized a\nne exeat right as one with \u201cthe purpose of preserving the jurisdiction of\nthe state in the custody matter and of safeguarding the visitation rights\nof the other parent.\u201d 1980 Conf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit interna\u00ad\ntional priv\u00e9, Enl\u00e8vement d\u2019enfants, Replies of the Governments to the\nQuestionnaire, in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzi\u00e8me session, pp.\n85, 88 (1982).

Thus, we have no informed basis to\nassess the Executive\u2019s postratification conduct, or the\nconduct of other signatories, to aid us in understanding\nthe accepted meaning of potentially ambiguous terms.

I understand the Court\u2019s reference to contemporary\nconsensus to depend on the views of contemporary scholars and indi\u00ad\nvidual signatory states developed postratification, including the views\nof the Special Commission, a voluntary post hac collective body with no\ntreaty-making authority, see ibid. Even assuming that the Court is\ncorrect that consensus has emerged after the Convention was written\nand ratified that ne exeat rights should be \u201crights of custody,\u201d in my\nview this provides no support at all for the position that the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s drafters had these types of rights in mind and intended for the\nConvention to treat them as rights of custody. To the contrary, I think\nit tends to prove the opposite point.\n   14 This is somewhat surprising given that in 1999 the Department\n\nmade 212 outgoing applications for return of children to the United\nStates and made 85 such requests in 2003.

The Court believes that\nthe views of our sister signatories to the Convention de\u00ad\nserve special attention when, in a case like this, \u201cCongress\nhas directed that \u2018uniform international interpretation\u2019 of\nthe Convention is part of the Convention\u2019s framework.\u201d\nAnte, at 12 (quoting 42 U.

And the\nhandful of foreign decisions the Court cites, see ante, at\n12\u201313, provide insufficient reason to depart from my\nunderstanding of the meaning of the Convention, an un\u00ad\nderstanding shared by many U. S. Courts of Appeals. See,\ne.g., 542 F. 3d 1081 (CA5 2008) (case below); Gonzalez v.\nGutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002) (parent\u2019s right to\n\u201crefuse permission for his children to leave Mexico\u201d\n\u201chardly amounts to a right of custody, in the plainest\nsense of the term\u201d); Croll, 229 F. 3d, at 140 (\u201cIf we were to\nenforce rights held pursuant to a ne exeat clause by the\nremedy of mandatory return, the Convention would be\u00ad\ncome unworkable. . . .

Argued January 12, 2010\u2014Decided May 17, 2010\nAfter the Abbotts, a married couple, moved to Chile and separated, the\n  Chilean courts granted respondent wife daily care and control of their\n  minor son, A. J. A., while awarding petitioner husband visitation\n  rights. Mr. Abbott also had a ne exeat right to consent before Ms. Ab\n  bott could take A. J. A. out of the country under Chile Minors Law\n  16,618 (Minors Law 16,618), art. 49. When Ms. Abbott brought\n  A. J. A. to Texas without permission from Mr. Abbott or the Chilean\n  family court, Mr. Abbott filed this suit in the Federal District Court,\n  seeking an order requiring his son\u2019s return to Chile under the Hague\n  Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction\n  (Convention) and the implementing statute, the International Child\n  Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 42 U. S. C. \u00a711601 et seq. Among\n  its provisions, the Convention seeks \u201cto secure the prompt return of\n  children wrongfully removed or retained in any Contracting State,\u201d\n  Art. 1; provides that such \u201cremoval or retention . . . is to be consid\n  ered wrongful where\u201d \u201cit is in breach of rights of custody attributed to\n  a person . . . under the law of the State in which the child was [there\n  tofore] habitually resident,\u201d Art. 3(a), and where \u201cthose rights [had\n  been] actually exercised . . . or would have been so exercised but for\n  the removal or retention,\u201d Art. 3(b); and defines \u201crights of custody\u201d to\n  \u201cinclude . . . the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence,\u201d Art.\n  5(a). The District Court denied relief, holding that the father\u2019s ne\n  exeat right did not constitute a \u201crigh[t] of custody\u201d under the Conven\n  tion and, thus, that the return remedy was not authorized. The Fifth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A parent has a right of custody under the Convention by reason of\n that parent\u2019s ne exeat right. Pp. 4\u201317.\n    (a) The Convention applies because A. J. A. is under 16; he was a\n2                          ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    habitual resident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States are\n    contracting states. The ICARA instructs the state or federal court in\n    which a petition alleging international child abduction has been filed\n    to \u201cdecide the case in accordance with the Convention.\u201d \u00a7\u00a711603(b),\n    (d). P. 5.\n       (b) That A. J. A. was wrongfully removed from Chile in violation of\n    a \u201crigh[t] of custody\u201d is shown by the Convention\u2019s text, by the U. S.\n    State Department\u2019s views, by contracting states\u2019 court decisions, and\n    by the Convention\u2019s purposes. Pp. 5\u201318.\n         (1) Chilean law determines the content of Mr. Abbott\u2019s right,\n    while the Convention\u2019s text and structure resolve whether that right\n    is a \u201crigh[t] of custody.\u201d Minors Law 16,618, art. 49, provides that\n    \u201c[o]nce the court has decreed\u201d that one of the parents has visitation\n    rights, that parent\u2019s \u201cauthorization\u201d generally \u201cshall also be required\u201d\n    before the child may be taken out of the country. Because Mr. Abbott\n    has direct and regular visitation rights, it follows that he has a\n    ne exeat right under article 49. The Convention recognizes that cus\n    tody rights can be decreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), and Mr. Ab\n    bott\u2019s ne exeat right is best classified as a \u201cjoint right of custody,\u201d\n    which the Convention defines to \u201cinclude rights relating to the care of\n    the person of the child and, in particular, the right to determine the\n    child\u2019s place of residence,\u201d Art. 5(a). Mr. Abbott\u2019s right to decide\n    A. J. A.\u2019s country of residence allows him to \u201cdetermine the child\u2019s\n    place of residence,\u201d especially given the Convention\u2019s purpose to pre\n    vent wrongful removal across international borders. It also gives him\n    \u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child,\u201d in that choos\n    ing A. J. A.\u2019s residence country can determine the shape of his early\n    and adolescent years and his language, identity, and culture and tra\n    ditions. That a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional physical\n    custody notions is beside the point because the Convention\u2019s defini\n    tion of \u201crights of custody\u201d controls. This uniform, text-based ap\n    proach ensures international consistency in interpreting the Conven\n    tion, foreclosing courts from relying on local usage to undermine\n    recognition of custodial arrangements in other countries and under\n    other legal traditions. In any case, this country has adopted modern\n    conceptions of custody e.g., joint legal custody, that accord with the\n    Convention\u2019s broad definition. Ms. Abbott mistakenly claims that a\n    ne exeat right cannot qualify as a right of custody because the Con\n    vention requires that any such right be capable of \u201cexercis[e].\u201d When\n    one parent removes a child without seeking the ne exeat holder\u2019s con\n    sent, it is an instance where the right would have been \u201cexercised but\n    for the removal or retention,\u201d Art. 3(b). The Fifth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\n    that a breach of a ne exeat right does not give rise to a return remedy\n    would render the Convention meaningless in many cases where it is\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nmost needed. Any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a right of access\nis atexual, as a ne exeat right is not even arguably a \u201cright to take a\nchild for a limited period of time.\u201d Art. 5(b). Ms. Abbott\u2019s argument\nthat the ne exeat order in this case cannot create a right of custody is\nnot dispositive because Mr. Abbott asserts rights under Minors Law\n16,618, which do not derive from the order. Pp. 6\u201311.\n     (2) This Court\u2019s conclusion is strongly supported and informed by\nthe longstanding view of the State Department\u2019s Office of Children\u2019s\nIssues, this country\u2019s Convention enforcement entity, that ne exeat\nrights are rights of custody. The Court owes deference to the Execu\ntive Branch\u2019s treaty interpretations. See Sumitomo Shoji America,\nInc. v. Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 185. There is no reason to doubt this\nwell-established canon here. The Executive, when dealing with deli\ncate foreign relations matters like international child abductions,\npossesses a great store of information on practical realities such as\nthe reactions from treaty partners to a particular treaty interpreta\ntion and the impact that interpretation may have on the State De\npartment\u2019s ability to reclaim children abducted from this country.\nPp. 11\u201312.\n     (3) The Court\u2019s view is also substantially informed by the views\nof sister contracting states on the issue, see El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd.\nv. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U. S. 155, 176, particularly because the\nICARA directs that \u201cuniform international interpretation\u201d of the\nConvention is part of its framework, see \u00a711601(b)(3)(B). While the\nSupreme Court of Canada has reached an arguably contrary view,\nand French courts are divided, a review of the international law con\nfirms that courts and other legal authorities in England, Israel, Aus\ntria, South Africa, Germany, Australia, and Scotland have accepted\nthe rule that ne exeat rights are rights of custody within the Conven\ntion\u2019s meaning. Scholars agree that there is an emerging interna\ntional consensus on the matter. And the Convention\u2019s history is fully\nconsistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights are just one of the\nmany ways in which custody of children can be exercised. Pp. 12\u201316.\n     (4) The Court\u2019s holding also accords with the Convention\u2019s objects\nand purposes. There is no reason to doubt the ability of other con\ntracting states to carry out their duty to make decisions in the best\ninterests of the children. To interpret the Convention to permit an\nabducting parent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other par\nent holds a ne exeat right, runs counter to the Convention\u2019s purpose of\ndeterring child abductions to a country that provides a friendlier fo\nrum. Denying such a remedy would legitimize the very action, re\nmoval of the child, that the Convention was designed to prevent,\nwhile requiring return of the child in cases like this one helps deter\nabductions and respects the Convention\u2019s purpose to prevent harms\n4                           ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    to the child resulting from abductions. Pp. 16\u201318.\n      (c) While a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of custody\n    and may seek a return remedy, return will not automatically be or\n    dered if the abducting parent can establish the applicability of a Con\n    vention exception, such as \u201ca grave risk that . . . return would expose\n    the child to . . . harm or [an] otherwise . . . intolerable situation,\u201d or\n    the objection to removal by a child who has reached a sufficient \u201cage\n    and degree of maturity\u201d to state a preference, Art. 13(b).

I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\u201311. The\nUnited States is a contracting state to the Convention; and\nCongress has implemented its provisions through the\nInternational Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), 102\nStat. 437, 42 U. S. C. \u00a711601 et seq. The Convention\nprovides that a child abducted in violation of \u201crights of\ncustody\u201d must be returned to the child\u2019s country of habit\u00ad\nual residence, unless certain exceptions apply. Art. 1, S.\nTreaty Doc. No. 99\u201311, at 7 (Treaty Doc.). The question is\nwhether a parent has a \u201crigh[t] of custody\u201d by reason of\nthat parent\u2019s ne exeat right: the authority to consent before\nthe other parent may take the child to another country.\n                           I\n   Timothy Abbott and Jacquelyn Vaye Abbott married in\nEngland in 1992. He is a British citizen, and she is a\ncitizen of the United States. Mr. Abbott\u2019s astronomy\n2                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprofession took the couple to Hawaii, where their son\nA. J. A. was born in 1995. The Abbotts moved to La\nSerena, Chile, in 2002. There was marital discord, and\nthe parents separated in March 2003. The Chilean courts\ngranted the mother daily care and control of the child,\nwhile awarding the father \u201cdirect and regular\u201d visitation\nrights, including visitation every other weekend and for\nthe whole month of February each year. App. 9.\n  Chilean law conferred upon Mr. Abbott what is com\u00ad\nmonly known as a ne exeat right: a right to consent before\nMs. Abbott could take A. J. A. out of Chile. See Minors\nLaw 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a\n(granting a ne exeat right to any parent with visitation\nrights). In effect a ne exeat right imposes a duty on one\nparent that is a right in the other. After Mr. Abbott ob\u00ad\ntained a British passport for A. J. A., Ms. Abbott grew\nconcerned that Mr. Abbott would take the boy to Britain.\nShe sought and obtained a \u201cne exeat of the minor\u201d order\nfrom the Chilean family court, prohibiting the boy from\nbeing taken out of Chile.\n  In August 2005, while proceedings before the Chilean\ncourt were pending, the mother removed the boy from\nChile without permission from either the father or the\ncourt. A private investigator located the mother and the\nchild in Texas. In February 2006, the mother filed for\ndivorce in Texas state court. Part of the relief she sought\nwas a modification of the father\u2019s rights, including full\npower in her to determine the boy\u2019s place of residence and\nan order limiting the father to supervised visitation in\nTexas. This litigation remains pending.\n  Mr. Abbott brought an action in Texas state court,\nasking for visitation rights and an order requiring Ms.\nAbbott to show cause why the court should not allow Mr.\nAbbott to return to Chile with A. J. A. In February 2006,\nthe court denied Mr. Abbott\u2019s requested relief but granted\nhim \u201cliberal periods of possession\u201d of A. J. A. throughout\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

He sought an order requiring his son\u2019s return to\nChile pursuant to the Convention and enforcement provi\u00ad\nsions of the ICARA. In July 2007, after holding a bench\ntrial during which only Mr. Abbott testified, the District\nCourt denied relief. The court held that the father\u2019s ne\nexeat right did not constitute a right of custody under the\nConvention and, as a result, that the return remedy was\nnot authorized. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008067\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008067/abbott-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The court held the father\npossessed no rights of custody under the Convention be\u00ad\ncause his ne exeat right was only \u201ca veto right over his\nson\u2019s departure from Chile.\u201d 542 F. 3d 1081, 1087 (2008).\nThe court expressed substantial agreement with the Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit in Croll v. Croll, 229\nF. 3d 133 (2000). Relying on American dictionary defini\u00ad\ntions of \u201ccustody\u201d and noting that ne exeat rights cannot be\n\u201c \u2018actually exercised\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the Conven\u00ad\ntion, Croll held that ne exeat rights are not rights of cus\u00ad\ntody. Id., at 138\u2013141 (quoting Art. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7).\nA dissenting opinion in Croll was filed by then-Judge\nSotomayor. The dissent maintained that a ne exeat right\nis a right of custody because it \u201cprovides a parent with\ndecisionmaking authority regarding a child\u2019s international\nrelocation.\u201d 229 F. 3d, at 146.\n    The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Ninth Circuits\nadopted the conclusion of the Croll majority.

The Convention seeks \u201cto secure the prompt\nreturn of children wrongfully removed to or retained in\nany Contracting State,\u201d and \u201cto ensure that rights of\ncustody and of access under the law of one Contracting\nState are effectively respected in the other Contracting\nStates.\u201d Art. 1, Treaty Doc., at 7.\n  The provisions of the Convention of most relevance at\nthe outset of this discussion are as follows:\n    \u201cArticle 3: The removal or the retention of the child is\n    to be considered wrongful where\u2014\n    \u201ca it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a\n    person, an institution or any other body, either jointly\n    or alone, under the law of the State in which the child\n    was habitually resident immediately before the re\u00ad\n    moval or retention; and\n    \u201cb at the time of removal or retention those rights\n    were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or\n    would have been so exercised but for the removal or\n    retention.\n        .           .               .          .       .\n    \u201cArticle 5: For the purposes of this Convention\u2014\n    \u201ca \u2018rights of custody\u2019 shall include rights relating to\n    the care of the person of the child and, in particular,\n    the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence;\n    \u201cb \u2018rights of access\u2019 shall include the right to take a\n    child for a limited period of time to a place other than\n    the child\u2019s habitual residence.\n        .           .               .          .       .\n    \u201cArticle 12: Where a child has been wrongfully re\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    moved or retained in terms of Article 3 . . . the author\u00ad\n    ity concerned shall order the return of the child\n    forthwith.\u201d Id., at 7, 9.\n   The Convention\u2019s central operating feature is the return\nremedy. When a child under the age of 16 has been\nwrongfully removed or retained, the country to which the\nchild has been brought must \u201corder the return of the child\nforthwith,\u201d unless certain exceptions apply. See, e.g., Arts.\n4, 12, ibid. A removal is \u201cwrongful\u201d where the child was\nremoved in violation of \u201crights of custody.\u201d The Conven\u00ad\ntion defines \u201crights of custody\u201d to \u201cinclude rights relating\nto the care of the person of the child and, in particular, the\nright to determine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art.\n5(a), id., at 7. A return remedy does not alter the pre-ab\u00ad\nduction allocation of custody rights but leaves custodial\ndecisions to the courts of the country of habitual residence.\nArt. 19, id., at 11. The Convention also recognizes \u201crights\nof access,\u201d but offers no return remedy for a breach of\nthose rights. Arts. 5(b), 21, id., at 7, 11.\n   The United States has implemented the Convention\nthrough the ICARA. The statute authorizes a person who\nseeks a child\u2019s return to file a petition in state or federal\ncourt and instructs that the court \u201cshall decide the case in\naccordance with the Convention.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a711603(a),\n(b), (d). If the child in question has been \u201cwrongfully\nremoved or retained within the meaning of the Conven\u00ad\ntion,\u201d the child shall be \u201cpromptly returned,\u201d unless an\nexception is applicable. \u00a711601(a)(4).\n                            III\n  As the parties agree, the Convention applies to this\ndispute. A. J. A. is under 16 years old; he was a habitual\nresident of Chile; and both Chile and the United States\nare contracting states. The question is whether A. J. A.\nwas \u201cwrongfully removed\u201d from Chile, in other words,\nwhether he was removed in violation of a right of custody.\n6                    ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nThis Court\u2019s inquiry is shaped by the text of the Conven\u00ad\ntion; the views of the United States Department of State;\ndecisions addressing the meaning of \u201crights of custody\u201d in\ncourts of other contracting states; and the purposes of the\nConvention. After considering these sources, the Court\ndetermines that Mr. Abbott\u2019s ne exeat right is a right of\ncustody under the Convention.\n                               A\n  \u201cThe interpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of\na statute, begins with its text.\u201d Medell\u00edn v. Texas, 552\nU. S. 491, 506 (2008). This Court consults Chilean law to\ndetermine the content of Mr. Abbott\u2019s right, while follow\u00ad\ning the Convention\u2019s text and structure to decide whether\nthe right at issue is a \u201crigh[t] of custody.\u201d\n  Chilean law granted Mr. Abbott a joint right to decide\nhis child\u2019s country of residence, otherwise known as a\nne exeat right. Minors Law 16,618, art. 49 (Chile), App. to\nPet. for Cert. 61a, 62a, provides that \u201c[o]nce the court has\ndecreed\u201d that one of the parents has visitation rights, that\nparent\u2019s \u201cauthorization . . . shall also be required\u201d before\nthe child may be taken out of the country, subject to court\noverride only where authorization \u201ccannot be granted or is\ndenied without good reason.\u201d Mr. Abbott has \u201cdirect and\nregular\u201d visitation rights and it follows from Chilean law,\nthat he has a shared right to determine his son\u2019s country\nof residence under this provision. App. 9. To support the\nconclusion that Mr. Abbott\u2019s right under Chilean law gives\nhim a joint right to decide his son\u2019s country of residence, it\nis notable that a Chilean agency has explained that Mi\u00ad\nnors Law 16,618 is a \u201cright to authorize the minors\u2019 exit\u201d\nfrom Chile and that this provision means that neither\nparent can \u201cunilaterally\u201d \u201cestablish the [child\u2019s] place of\nresidence.\u201d Letter from Paula Strap Camus, Director\nGeneral, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of the Region\nMetropolitana, to National Center for Missing and Ex\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nploited Children (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nVillegas Duran v. Arribada Beaumont, No. 08\u2013775, pp.\n35a\u201337a, cert. pending.\n   The Convention recognizes that custody rights can be\ndecreed jointly or alone, see Art. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7;\nand Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to determine his son\u2019s country\nof residence is best classified as a joint right of custody, as\nthe Convention defines that term. The Convention defines\n\u201crights of custody\u201d to \u201cinclude rights relating to the care of\nthe person of the child and, in particular, the right to\ndetermine the child\u2019s place of residence.\u201d Art. 5(a), ibid.\nMr. Abbott\u2019s ne exeat right gives him both the joint \u201cright\nto determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d and joint\n\u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child.\u201d\n   Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to decide A. J. A.\u2019s country of\nresidence allows him to \u201cdetermine the child\u2019s place of\nresidence.\u201d The phrase \u201cplace of residence\u201d encompasses\nthe child\u2019s country of residence, especially in light of the\nConvention\u2019s explicit purpose to prevent wrongful removal\nacross international borders. See Convention Preamble,\nTreaty Doc., at 7. And even if \u201cplace of residence\u201d refers\nonly to the child\u2019s street address within a country, a\nne exeat right still entitles Mr. Abbott to \u201cdetermine\u201d that\nplace. \u201c[D]etermine\u201d can mean \u201c[t]o fix conclusively or\nauthoritatively,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n711 (2d ed. 1954) (2d definition), but it can also mean \u201c[t]o\nset bounds or limits to,\u201d ibid. (1st definition), which is\nwhat Mr. Abbott\u2019s ne exeat right allows by ensuring that\nA. J. A. cannot live at any street addresses outside of\nChile. It follows that the Convention\u2019s protection of a\nparent\u2019s custodial \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of\nresidence\u201d includes a ne exeat right.\n   Mr. Abbott\u2019s joint right to determine A. J. A.\u2019s country of\nresidence also gives him \u201crights relating to the care of the\nperson of the child.\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. Few\ndecisions are as significant as the language the child\n8                    ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nspeaks, the identity he finds, or the culture and traditions\nshe will come to absorb. These factors, so essential to self\u00ad\ndefinition, are linked in an inextricable way to the child\u2019s\ncountry of residence. One need only consider the different\nchildhoods an adolescent will experience if he or she grows\nup in the United States, Chile, Germany, or North Korea,\nto understand how choosing a child\u2019s country of residence\nis a right \u201crelating to the care of the person of the child.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeals described Mr. Abbott\u2019s right to take\npart in making this decision as a mere \u201cveto,\u201d 542 F. 3d, at\n1087; but even by that truncated description, the father\nhas an essential role in deciding the boy\u2019s country of resi\u00ad\ndence. For example, Mr. Abbott could condition his con\u00ad\nsent to a change in country on A. J. A.\u2019s moving to a city\noutside Chile where Mr. Abbott could obtain an astronomy\nposition, thus allowing the father to have continued con\u00ad\ntact with the boy.\n   That a ne exeat right does not fit within traditional\nnotions of physical custody is beside the point. The Con\u00ad\nvention defines \u201crights of custody,\u201d and it is that definition\nthat a court must consult. This uniform, text-based ap\u00ad\nproach ensures international consistency in interpreting\nthe Convention. It forecloses courts from relying on defi\u00ad\nnitions of custody confined by local law usage, definitions\nthat may undermine recognition of custodial arrange\u00ad\nments in other countries or in different legal traditions,\nincluding the civil-law tradition. And, in any case, our\nown legal system has adopted conceptions of custody that\naccord with the Convention\u2019s broad definition. Joint legal\ncustody, in which one parent cares for the child while the\nother has joint decisionmaking authority concerning the\nchild\u2019s welfare, has become increasingly common. See\nSinger, Dispute Resolution and the Postdivorce Family:\nImplications of a Paradigm Shift, 47 Family Ct. Rev. 363,\n366 (2009) (\u201c[A] recent study of child custody outcomes in\nNorth Carolina indicated that almost 70% of all custody\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresolutions included joint legal custody, as did over 90% of\nall mediated custody agreements\u201d); E. Maccoby & R.\nMnookin, Dividing the Child: Social and Legal Dilemmas\nof Custody 107 (1992) (\u201c[F]or 79% of our entire sample, the\n[California] divorce decree provided for joint legal cus\u00ad\ntody\u201d); see generally Elrod, Reforming the System to Pro\u00ad\ntect Children in High Conflict Custody Cases, 28 Wm.\nMitchell L. Rev. 495, 505\u2013508 (2001).\n   Ms. Abbott gets the analysis backwards in claiming that\na ne exeat right is not a right of custody because the Con\u00ad\nvention requires that any right of custody must be capable\nof exercise. The Convention protects rights of custody\nwhen \u201cat the time of removal or retention those rights\nwere actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would\nhave been so exercised but for the removal or retention.\u201d\nArt. 3(b), Treaty Doc., at 7. In cases like this one, a\nne exeat right is by its nature inchoate and so has no\noperative force except when the other parent seeks to\nremove the child from the country. If that occurs, the\nparent can exercise the ne exeat right by declining consent\nto the exit or placing conditions to ensure the move will be\nin the child\u2019s best interests. When one parent removes the\nchild without seeking the ne exeat holder\u2019s consent, it is an\ninstance where the right would have been \u201cexercised but\nfor the removal or retention.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that a breach of a ne\nexeat right does not give rise to a return remedy would\nrender the Convention meaningless in many cases where\nit is most needed. The Convention provides a return\nremedy when a parent takes a child across international\nborders in violation of a right of custody. The Convention\nprovides no return remedy when a parent removes a child\nin violation of a right of access but requires contracting\nstates \u201cto promote the peaceful enjoyment of access\nrights.\u201d Art. 21, id., at 11. For example, a court may force\nthe custodial parent to pay the travel costs of visitation,\n10                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsee, e.g., Viragh v. Foldes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2157684\"><a href=\"/opinion/2157684/viragh-v-foldes/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109\u2013111, 612\nN.

But unlike rights\nof access, ne exeat rights can only be honored with a return\nremedy because these rights depend on the child\u2019s location\nbeing the country of habitual residence.\n   Any suggestion that a ne exeat right is a \u201crigh[t] of\naccess\u201d is illogical and atextual. The Convention defines\n\u201crights of access\u201d as \u201cinclud[ing] the right to take a child\nfor a limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s\nhabitual residence,\u201d Art. 5(b), Treaty Doc., at 7, and\nICARA defines that same term as \u201cvisitation rights,\u201d\n\u00a711602(7). The joint right to decide a child\u2019s country of\nresidence is not even arguably a \u201cright to take a child for a\nlimited period of time\u201d or a \u201cvisitation righ[t].\u201d Reaching\nthe commonsense conclusion that a ne exeat right does not\nfit these definitions of \u201crights of access\u201d honors the Con\u00ad\nvention\u2019s distinction between rights of access and rights of\ncustody.\n   Ms. Abbott argues that the ne exeat order in this case\ncannot create a right of custody because it merely protects\na court\u2019s jurisdiction over the child. Even if this argument\nwere correct, it would not be dispositive. Ms. Abbott\ncontends the Chilean court\u2019s ne exeat order contains no\nparental consent provision and so awards the father no\nrights, custodial or otherwise. See Brief for Respondent\n22; but see 495 F. Supp. 2d, at 638, n. 3 (the District Court\ntreating the order as containing a consent provision); 542\nF. 3d, at 1084 (same for the Court of Appeals). Even a\nne exeat order issued to protect a court\u2019s jurisdiction pend\u00ad\ning issuance of further decrees is consistent with allowing\na parent to object to the child\u2019s removal from the country.\nThis Court need not decide the status of ne exeat orders\nlacking parental consent provisions, however; for here the\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But\nthe Canadian cases are not precisely on point here.\nThomson ordered a return remedy based on an interim\nne exeat order, and only noted in dicta that it may not\norder such a remedy pursuant to a permanent ne exeat\norder. See [1994] 3 S. C. R., at 589\u2013590, 119 D. L. R. (4th),\nat 281. D. S. involved a parent\u2019s claim based on an im\u00ad\n14                   ABBOTT v.

A French Court of Appeals\nheld that \u201cthe right to accept or refuse the removal of the\nchildren\u2019s residence\u201d outside of a region was \u201ca joint exer\u00ad\ncise of rights of custody.\u201d Public Ministry v.

C.\n   Scholars agree that there is an emerging international\nconsensus that ne exeat rights are rights of custody, even if\nthat view was not generally formulated when the Conven\u00ad\ntion was drafted in 1980. At that time, joint custodial\narrangements were unknown in many of the contracting\nstates, and the status of ne exeat rights was not yet well\nunderstood. See 1980 Conf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit\ninternational priv\u00e9, Enl\u00e8vement d\u2019enfants, morning meet\u00ad\ning of Wed., Oct. 8, 1980 (discussion by Messrs.

Since 1980, however, joint custodial arrange\u00ad\nments have become more common. See supra, at 8\u20139.\nAnd, within this framework, most contracting states and\nscholars now recognize that ne exeat rights are rights of\ncustody.

See 1980 Con\u00ad\nf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\u00e9, Enl\u00e8ve\u00ad\nment d\u2019enfants, E.

We need not\ndecide whether this Report should be given greater weight\nthan a scholarly commentary. Compare Hague Interna\u00ad\ntional Child Abduction Convention; Text and Legal Analy\u00ad\nsis, 51 Fed. Reg. 10503\u201310506 (1986) (identifying the\nReport as the \u201cofficial history\u201d of the Convention and \u201ca\nsource of background on the meaning of the provisions of\nthe Convention\u201d), with P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b68, at 427\u2013428\n(\u201c[the Report] has not been approved by the Conference,\nand it is possible that, despite the Rapporter\u2019s [sic] efforts\nto remain objective, certain passages reflect a viewpoint\nwhich is in part subjective\u201d). It suffices to note that the\nReport supports the conclusion that ne exeat rights are\n16                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrights of custody. The Report explains that rather than\ndefining custody in precise terms or referring to the laws\nof different nations pertaining to parental rights, the\nConvention uses the unadorned term \u201crights of custody\u201d to\nrecognize \u201call the ways in which custody of children can be\nexercised\u201d through \u201ca flexible interpretation of the terms\nused, which allows the greatest possible number of cases\nto be brought into consideration.\u201d Id., \u00b6\u00b667, 71, at 446,\n447\u2013448. Thus the Report rejects the notion that because\nne exeat rights do not encompass the right to make medi\u00ad\ncal or some other important decisions about a child\u2019s life\nthey cannot be rights of custody. Indeed, the Report is\nfully consistent with the conclusion that ne exeat rights\nare just one of the many \u201cways in which custody of chil\u00ad\ndren can be exercised.\u201d Id., \u00b6 71, at 447.\n                              D\n   Adopting the view that the Convention provides a re\u00ad\nturn remedy for violations of ne exeat rights accords with\nits objects and purposes. The Convention is based on the\nprinciple that the best interests of the child are well\nserved when decisions regarding custody rights are made\nin the country of habitual residence. See Convention\nPreamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Ordering a return remedy\ndoes not alter the existing allocation of custody rights, Art.\n19, id., at 11, but does allow the courts of the home coun\u00ad\ntry to decide what is in the child\u2019s best interests. It is the\nConvention\u2019s premise that courts in contracting states will\nmake this determination in a responsible manner.\n   Custody decisions are often difficult. Judges must strive\nalways to avoid a common tendency to prefer their own\nsociety and culture, a tendency that ought not interfere\nwith objective consideration of all the factors that should\nbe weighed in determining the best interests of the child.\nThis judicial neutrality is presumed from the mandate of\nthe Convention, which affirms that the contracting states\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare \u201c[f]irmly convinced that the interests of children are of\nparamount importance in matters relating to their cus\u00ad\ntody.\u201d Convention Preamble, Treaty Doc., at 7. Interna\u00ad\ntional law serves a high purpose when it underwrites\nthe determination by nations to rely upon their domes\u00ad\ntic courts to enforce just laws by legitimate and fair\nproceedings.\n   To interpret the Convention to permit an abducting\nparent to avoid a return remedy, even when the other\nparent holds a ne exeat right, would run counter to the\nConvention\u2019s purpose of deterring child abductions by\nparents who attempt to find a friendlier forum for deciding\ncustodial disputes. Ms. Abbott removed A. J. A. from\nChile while Mr. Abbott\u2019s request to enhance his relation\u00ad\nship with his son was still pending before Chilean courts.\nAfter she landed in Texas, the mother asked the state\ncourt to diminish or eliminate the father\u2019s custodial and\nvisitation rights. The Convention should not be inter\u00ad\npreted to permit a parent to select which country will\nadjudicate these questions by bringing the child to a dif\u00ad\nferent country, in violation of a ne exeat right. Denying a\nreturn remedy for the violation of such rights would \u201cle\u00ad\ngitimize the very action\u2014removal of the child\u2014that the\nhome country, through its custody order [or other provi\u00ad\nsion of law], sought to prevent\u201d and would allow \u201cparents\nto undermine the very purpose of the Convention.\u201d Croll,\n229 F. 3d, at 147 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). This Court\nshould be most reluctant to adopt an interpretation that\ngives an abducting parent an advantage by coming here to\navoid a return remedy that is granted, for instance, in the\nUnited Kingdom, Israel, Germany, and South Africa. See\nsupra, at 12\u201313.\n   Requiring a return remedy in cases like this one helps\ndeter child abductions and respects the Convention\u2019s\npurpose to prevent harms resulting from abductions. An\nabduction can have devastating consequences for a child.\n18                   ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cSome child psychologists believe that the trauma children\nsuffer from these abductions is one of the worst forms of\nchild abuse.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 103\u2013390, p. 2 (1993). A child\nabducted by one parent is separated from the second\nparent and the child\u2019s support system. Studies have\nshown that separation by abduction can cause psychologi\u00ad\ncal problems ranging from depression and acute stress\ndisorder to posttraumatic stress disorder and identity\u00ad\nformation issues. See N. Faulkner, Parental Child Abduc\u00ad\ntion is Child Abuse (1999), http://www.prevent-abuse\u00ad\nnow.com/unreport.htm (as visited May 13, 2010, and\navailable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). A child abducted at\nan early age can experience loss of community and stabil\u00ad\nity, leading to loneliness, anger, and fear of abandonment.\nSee Huntington, Parental Kidnapping: A New Form of\nChild Abuse (1982), in American Prosecutors Research\nInstitute\u2019s National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse,\nParental Abduction Project, Investigation and Prosecution\nof Parental Abduction (1995) (App. A). Abductions may\nprevent the child from forming a relationship with the left\u00ad\nbehind parent, impairing the child\u2019s ability to mature. See\nFaulkner, supra, at 5.\n                              IV\n   While a parent possessing a ne exeat right has a right of\ncustody and may seek a return remedy, a return order is\nnot automatic. Return is not required if the abducting\nparent can establish that a Convention exception applies.\nOne exception states return of the child is not required\nwhen \u201cthere is a grave risk that his or her return would\nexpose the child to physical or psychological harm or\notherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\u201d Art.\n13(b), Treaty Doc., at 10. If, for example, Ms. Abbott could\ndemonstrate that returning to Chile would put her own\nsafety at grave risk, the court could consider whether this\nis sufficient to show that the child too would suffer \u201cpsy\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The Convention also allows courts to decline\nto order removal if the child objects, if the child has\nreached a sufficient \u201cage and degree of maturity at which\nit is appropriate to take account of its views.\u201d Art. 13(b),\nTreaty Doc., at 10.

J. A., has no\nauthority to decide whether his son undergoes a particular\nmedical procedure; whether his son attends a school field\ntrip; whether and in what manner his son has a religious\nupbringing; or whether his son can play a videogame\nbefore he completes his homework. These are all rights\nand responsibilities of A. J. A.\u2019s mother, respondent Jac\u00ad\nquelyn Abbott. It is she who received sole custody, or\n\u201cdaily care and control,\u201d of A. J. A. when the expatriate\ncouple divorced while living in Chile in 2004. 495 F. Supp.\n2d 635, 637, and n. 2 (WD Tex. 2007). Mr. Abbott pos\u00ad\nsesses only visitation rights.\n   On Ms. Abbott\u2019s custodial rights, Chilean law placed a\nrestriction: She was not to travel with her son outside of\nChile without either Mr. Abbott\u2019s or the court\u2019s consent.\nPut differently, Mr. Abbott had the opportunity to veto\nMs. Abbott\u2019s decision to remove A. J. A. from Chile unless\na Chilean court overrode that veto. The restriction on\nA. J. A.\u2019s and Ms. Abbott\u2019s travel was an automatic, de\u00ad\nfault provision of Chilean law operative upon the award of\nvisitation rights under Article 48 of Chile\u2019s Minors Law\n16,618. It is this travel restriction\u2014also known as a ne\nexeat clause\u2014that the Court today declares is a \u201c \u2018righ[t] of\n2                        ABBOTT v.

I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty\nDoc. No. 99\u201311. Ante, at 1.\n  Because the Court concludes that this travel restriction\nconstitutes a right of custody, and because Ms. Abbott\nindisputably violated the restriction when she took A. J. A.\nfrom Chile without either Mr. Abbott\u2019s or the court\u2019s per\u00ad\nmission, Mr. Abbott is now entitled to the return of\nA. J. A. to Chile under the terms of the Convention. Thus,\nabsent a finding of an exception to the Convention\u2019s pow\u00ad\nerful return remedy, see ante, at 18\u201319, and even if the\nreturn is contrary to the child\u2019s best interests, an Ameri\u00ad\ncan court must now order the return of A. J. A. to Mr.\nAbbott, who has no legal authority over A. J. A., based\nsolely on his possessing a limited veto power over Ms.\nAbbott\u2019s ability to take A. J. A. from Chile. As I shall\nexplain, use of the Convention\u2019s return remedy under\nthese circumstances is contrary to the Convention\u2019s text\nand purpose.\n                                I\n   When the drafters of the Convention gathered in 1980,\nthey sought an international solution to an emerging\nproblem: transborder child abductions perpetrated by\nnoncustodial parents \u201cto establish artificial jurisdictional\nlinks . . . with a view to obtaining custody of a child.\u201d 1980\nConf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit international priv\u00e9,\nEnl\u00e8vement d\u2019enfants, E.

The drafters\u2019 primary concern\nwas to remedy abuses by noncustodial parents who at\u00ad\ntempt to circumvent adverse custody decrees (e.g., those\ngranting sole custodial rights to the other parent) by\nseeking a more favorable judgment in a second nation\u2019s\nfamily court system. P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b614, at 429.\n   The drafters determined that when a noncustodial\nparent abducts a child across international borders, the\nbest remedy is return of that child to his or her country of\nhabitual residence\u2014or, in other words, the best remedy is\nreturn of the child to his or her custodial parent. Id., \u00b618,\nat 430. The drafters concluded that the same remedy\nshould not follow, however, when a custodial parent takes\na child from his or her country of habitual residence in\nbreach of the other parent\u2019s visitation rights, or \u201crights of\naccess\u201d in the Convention\u2019s parlance. Id., \u00b665, at 444\u2013445.\nThe distinction between rights of custody and rights of\naccess, therefore, is critically important to the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s scheme and purpose. It defines the scope of the\navailable Convention remedies.\n   Article 5 defines these rights as follows:\n    \u201cFor the purposes of this Convention\u2014\n    \u201ca \u2018rights of custody\u2019 shall include rights relating to\n    the care of the person of the child and, in particular,\n    the right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence;\n    \u201cb \u2018rights of access\u2019 shall include the right to take a\n    child for a limited period of time to a place other than\n    the child\u2019s habitual residence.\u201d S.

The fact that a removal\nmay be \u201cwrongful\u201d in the sense that it violates domestic\nlaw or violates only \u201crights of access\u201d does not make it\n\u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of the Convention.\n   Only when a removal is \u201cwrongful\u201d under Article 3 may\nthe parent who possesses custody rights force the child\u2019s\nreturn to the country of habitual residence under the\nConvention\u2019s remedial procedures, pursuant to Articles 8\nthrough 20. For those removals that frustrate a noncusto\u00ad\ndial parent\u2019s \u201crights of access,\u201d the Convention provides\nthat the noncustodial parent may file an application \u201cto\nmake arrangements for organizing or securing the effec\u00ad\ntive exercise of rights of access\u201d; but he may not force the\nchild\u2019s return. Art. 21, id., at 11. A parent without \u201crights\nof custody,\u201d therefore, does not have the power granted by\nArticle 3 to compel the child\u2019s return to his or her country\nof habitual residence.

Putting aside the effect of the travel restriction, it is\nundisputed that Ms. Abbott possesses \u201crights of custody\u201d\nover A. J. A. while Mr. Abbott would possess \u201crights of\naccess,\u201d as those terms are used in the Convention. Brief\nfor Petitioner 6; Brief for Respondent 6. The only issue in\nthis case, therefore, is whether Mr. Abbott also possesses\n\u201crights of custody\u201d within the meaning of the Convention\nby virtue of the travel restriction, or ne exeat clause,3 that\nChilean law imposes on Ms. Abbott. In other words, the\nquestion is whether the \u201cright\u201d of one parent to veto the\nother parent\u2019s decision to remove a child from the country,\nsubject to judicial override, belongs in the category of\n\u201crights relating to the care of the person of the child and,\nin particular, the right to determine the child\u2019s place of\nresidence.\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. In my judgment,\nit clearly does not, and I need look no further than to the\nConvention\u2019s text to explain why. See Medell\u00edn v. Texas,\n552 U. S. 491, 506 (2008) (\u201cThe interpretation of a treaty,\nlike the interpretation of a statute, begins with its text\u201d).\n   Rights relating to the care of the child. The Court con\u00ad\ncludes that the veto power Mr. Abbott has over Ms. Ab\u00ad\nbott\u2019s travel plans is equivalent to those rights \u201c \u2018relating\nto the care of the person of the child.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 7\u20138. This\nis so, the Court tells us, because Mr. Abbott has a limited\npower to keep A. J. A. within Chile\u2019s bounds and, there\u00ad\nfore, indirectly to influence \u201cthe language the child speaks,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwas only wrongful within the meaning of the Convention if it was in\nbreach of Mr. Abbott\u2019s rights of custody. Unfortunately, I fear the\nCourt\u2019s preoccupation with deterring parental misconduct\u2014even,\npotentially, at the sake of the best interests of the child\u2014has caused it\nto minimize this important distinction.\n  3 The Court repeatedly refers to \u201cne exeat rights,\u201d ante, at 3, 10, 11,\n\n12, 14, 15, and 16, as if the single travel restriction at issue in this case\nwere on a par with the multiple rights commonly exercised by custodial\nparents. Chile\u2019s statutory ne exeat provision is better characterized as\na restriction on the travel of both the minor and the custodial parent\nthan as a bundle of \u201crights\u201d possessed by the noncustodial parent.\n6                    ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe identity he finds, or the culture and traditions she will\ncome to absorb.\u201d Ante, at 7. It is not nearly as self-evident\nas the Court assumes that Mr. Abbott\u2019s veto power carries\nwith it any ability to decide the language A. J. A. speaks\nor the cultural experiences he will have, ante, at 7\u20138. A. J.\nA.\u2019s mere presence in Chile does not determine any num\u00ad\nber of issues, including: whether A. J. A. learns Spanish\nwhile there; whether he attends an American school or a\nBritish school or a local school; whether he participates in\nsports; whether he is raised Catholic or Jewish or Bud\u00ad\ndhist or atheist; whether he eats a vegetarian diet; and on\nand on. The travel restriction does not confer upon Mr.\nAbbott affirmative power to make any number of decisions\nthat are vital to A. J. A.\u2019s physical, psychological, and\ncultural development. To say that a limited power to veto\na child\u2019s travel plans confers, also, a right \u201crelating to the\ncare\u201d of that child devalues the great wealth of decisions a\ncustodial parent makes on a daily basis to attend to a\nchild\u2019s needs and development.\n  The Court\u2019s interpretation depends entirely on a broad\nreading of the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d in the Convention\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201crights of custody.\u201d It is, undeniably, broad\nlanguage. But, as the Court reads the term, it is so broad\nas to be utterly unhelpful in interpreting what \u201crights of\ncustody\u201d means. We \u201ccannot forget that we ultimately are\ndetermining the meaning of the term\u201d rights of custody in\nthis case, and we should not lose sight of the import of this\nterm in construing the broad words that follow in its wake.\nLeocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 11 (2004). I suppose it\ncould be said that Mr. Abbott\u2019s ability to decide whether\nA. J. A. spends the night with one of his friends during a\nSaturday visit is also a \u201cright relating to the care of the\nchild.\u201d Taken in the abstract\u2014and to its most absurd\u2014\nany decision on behalf of a child could be construed as a\nright \u201crelating to\u201d the care of a child.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  Such a view of the text obliterates the careful distinction\nthe drafters drew between the rights of custody and the\nrights of access. Undoubtedly, they were aware of the\nconcept of joint custody. See P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b671, at\n457 (\u201c[C]ustody rights may have been awarded . . . to that\nperson in his own right or jointly. It cannot be otherwise\nin an era when types of joint custody, regarded as best\nsuited to the general principle of sexual non\u00ad\ndiscrimination, are gradually being introduced into inter\u00ad\nnal law\u201d). But just because rights of custody can be shared\nby two parents, it does not follow that the drafters in\u00ad\ntended this limited veto power to be a right of custody.\nAnd yet this, it seems, is how the Court understands the\ncase: Because the drafters intended to account for joint\ncustodial arrangements, they intended for this travel\nrestriction to be joint custody because it could be said, in\nsome abstract sense, to relate to care of the child. I fail to\nunderstand how the Court\u2019s reading is faithful to the\nConvention\u2019s text and purpose, given that the text ex\u00ad\npressly contemplates two distinct classes of parental\nrights. Today\u2019s decision converts every noncustodial par\u00ad\nent with access rights\u2014at least in Chile\u2014into a custodial\nparent for purposes of the Convention.\n  On this point, it is important to observe the effect of the\nCourt\u2019s decision to classify the travel restriction as a right\n\u201crelating to\u201d A. J. A.\u2019s care. Mr. Abbott possesses no legal\nauthority presently to exercise care or control of A. J. A.,\nor to make decisions on his behalf. The Court would nev\u00ad\nertheless read the Convention to require A. J. A.\u2019s return\nto a parent without such rights merely because the travel\nrestriction, in an abstract sense, could be said to relate to\nA. J. A.\u2019s care. The Court fails to explain how a parent\nwho otherwise possesses no legal authority to exercise\n\u201ccharge,\u201d \u201csupervision,\u201d or \u201cmanagement\u201d over a child, see\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 338 (1986)\n(hereinafter Webster\u2019s) (5th definition of \u201ccare\u201d), can be\u00ad\n8                    ABBOTT v.

The\nCourt also concludes that Mr. Abbott\u2019s veto power satisfies\nthe Convention\u2019s definition of custodial rights because it\nis, in the Court\u2019s view, a \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s\nplace of residence.\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty Doc., at 7. I disagree\nwith the Court\u2019s assessment of the significance and mean\u00ad\ning of this phrase, both on its face and within the context\nof the Convention\u2019s other provisions.\n   As an initial matter, the Court\u2019s reading of the Conven\u00ad\ntion depends on isolating the phrase \u201cand, in particular,\nthe right to determine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d to\nrefer to a freestanding right separate and apart from the\nrights related to the care of the child. I do not agree with\nthis view of the text, nor did the Convention\u2019s drafters:\n    \u201cThe Convention seeks to be more precise by empha\u00ad\n    sizing, as an example of the \u2018care\u2019 referred to [in the\n    \u201c \u2018rights of custody\u2019 \u201d clause, Art. 5(a)], the right to de\u00ad\n    termine the child\u2019s place of residence. However, if the\n    child, although still a minor at law, has the right itself\n    to determine its own place of residence, the substance\n    of the custody rights will have to be determined in the\n    context of other rights concerning the person of the\n    child.\u201d P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b684, at 452 (emphasis\n    added).\n   The drafters thus intended the \u201cright to determine the\nchild\u2019s place of residence\u201d to be an \u201cexample\u201d of what the\nConvention means by \u201ccare of the person of the child.\u201d It\nis indicative of the \u201csubstance\u201d of what it means to be a\ncustodial parent. The definition is not, as the Court would\nhave it, one stick in the bundle that may be parsed as a\nsingular \u201c \u2018righ[t] of custody,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 1; rather, it is a\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

The parent responsible for determining where\nand with whom a child resides, the drafters assumed,\nwould likely also be the parent who has the responsibility\nto \u201ccare\u201d for the child.\n   Yet even assuming, as the Court does, that the \u201cright to\ndetermine the child\u2019s place of residence,\u201d Art. 5(a), Treaty\nDoc., at 7, is divisible from the \u201ccare\u201d of the child, ibid., I\nstill fail to understand how a travel restriction on one\nparent\u2019s exercise of her custodial rights is equivalent to an\naffirmative \u201cright to determine the child\u2019s place of resi\u00ad\ndence.\u201d Analyzing its text, in the context of the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s focus on distinguishing custodial parents from non\u00ad\ncustodial ones, leads me to conclude that the \u201cright to\ndetermine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d means the power\nto set or fix the location of the child\u2019s home. It does not\nrefer to the more abstract power to keep a child within one\nnation\u2019s borders.\n   \u201cTo determine\u201d means \u201cto fix conclusively or authorita\u00ad\ntively\u201d or \u201cto settle a question or controversy.\u201d4 Webster\u2019s\n616.

In the context of understanding the meaning\nof rights of custody, the phrase \u201cto determine\u201d cannot be so indetermi\u00ad\nnate as to merely set \u201climits to\u201d a child\u2019s place of residence.\n      Although the Court emphasizes that the definition of \u201cto deter\u00ad\nmine\u201d on which it relies is the first such entry in Webster\u2019s, ante, at 7, it\nis worth noting that surely the Court would not rely on the first such\ndefinition of the word \u201ccare\u201d in that source (\u201csuffering of mind; grief;\nsorrow\u201d) to understand the Convention\u2019s use of that word. See Web\u00ad\nster\u2019s 2d, at 405. Instead, the fifth definition of that word\u2014\u201ccharge,\nsupervision, management\u201d\u2014is clearly the relevant one. The point is\nonly that context, as well as common sense, matters when selecting\namong possible definitions.\n10                       ABBOTT v.

In\nthe law, \u201cresidence\u201d can mean: \u201c[t]he act or fact of living in\na given place for some time\u201d; \u201c[t]he place where one actu\u00ad\nally lives\u201d; or, \u201c[a] house or other fixed abode; a dwelling.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1423 (9th ed. 2009).5 Lay defini\u00ad\ntions of \u201cresidence\u201d similarly describe a specific location:\n\u201cthe act or fact of abiding or dwelling in a place for some\ntime\u201d; \u201cthe place where one actually lives or has his\nhome\u201d; or, \u201ca temporary or permanent dwelling place,\nabode, or habitation.\u201d Webster\u2019s 1931. It follows that a\n\u201cplace of residence\u201d describes a \u201cphysical\u201d location in\nwhich a child \u201cactually lives.\u201d\n   The Court\u2019s reading of this text depends on its substitu\u00ad\ntion of the word \u201ccountry\u201d for the word \u201cplace.\u201d Such a\nsubstitution is not illogical, of course, in light of the Con\u00ad\nvention\u2019s international focus. See Croll v. Croll, 229 F. 3d\n133, 147, 148 (CA2 2000) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (read\u00ad\ning \u201cplace of residence\u201d to mean \u201cauthority over the child\u2019s\nmore specific living arrangements\u201d \u201cignores the basic\ninternational character of the Hague Convention\u201d). But it\nis inconsistent with the Convention\u2019s text and purpose.\n   When the drafters wanted to refer to country, they did.\nFor example, in Article 3, the drafters explained that\nrights of custody should be defined by looking to \u201cthe law\nof the State in which the child was habitually resident.\u201d\nArt. 3(a), Treaty Doc., at 7.

The point is: When the drafters\nwanted to refer to a particular geographic unit, they\ndid so.\n    Instead, the drafters elected the formulation \u201cplace of\nresidence,\u201d which is also utilized similarly in the definition\nof \u201crights of access.\u201d See Art. 5(b), id., at 7 (defining\n\u201c \u2018rights of access\u2019 \u201d to include \u201cthe right to take a child for\na limited period of time to a place other than the child\u2019s\nhabitual residence\u201d (emphasis added)). And they utilized\nthis phrase only within one particular Article, as opposed\nto their more frequent use of \u201cState of habitual residence\u201d\nthroughout the Convention.

We would not presume to ascribe this\ndifference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship\u201d). There\nis no reason we should presume otherwise in the context of\ntreaties.\n   Accordingly, I would give \u201cplace of residence\u201d the loca\u00ad\ntion-specific meaning its plain text connotes, irrespective\nof the fact that this Convention concerns international\nabduction. The right described by the Convention is the\nright to decide, conclusively, where a child\u2019s home will be.\nAnd this makes a good deal of sense. The child lives with\nthe parent who has custodial rights or, in the language of\nthe Convention, \u201ccare of the person of the child,\u201d Art. 5(a),\nTreaty Doc., at 7. The child\u2019s home\u2014his or her \u201cplace of\nresidence\u201d\u2014is fixed by the custody arrangement.7 This\ncomports too with the Convention\u2019s decision to privilege\nthe rights of custodians over the rights of those parents\nwith only visitation rights.\n   Understanding the effect of a travel restriction. So, the\nquestion we confront is whether a travel restriction on one\nparent\u2019s right to embark on international travel with his\nor her child creates in the other parent a \u201cright to deter\u00ad\nmine the child\u2019s place of residence\u201d or the ability \u201cto fix\nconclusively\u201d the child\u2019s \u201cphysical\u201d \u201chome.\u201d Before answer\u00ad\ning this question, it is important to understand the nature\nof the travel restriction we must classify.\n   The departure of a minor from Chile\u2014including when\nthat child lives in a married, two-parent household\u2014is\ngoverned by Article 49 of \u00a716,618 of that country\u2019s Minors\nLaw.

ABBOTT\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe restriction Chilean law places on Ms. Abbott\u2019s move\u00ad\nment, Mr. Abbott has no \u201cright to determine [A. J. A.\u2019s]\nplace of residence.\u201d He cannot \u201cconclusively\u201d \u201cfix,\u201d \u201csettle,\u201d\nor \u201cdetermine\u201d the place where A. J. A. \u201cactually lives or\nhas his home.\u201d See supra, at 9\u201310. True, the travel re\u00ad\nstriction bestows upon the noncustodial parent a limited\npower to prevent his child from leaving the country with\u00ad\nout his permission, but it does not grant an affirmative\npower to fix or set the location of the child\u2019s home. Mr.\nAbbott has no power whatever to determine where A. J. A.\nactually lives within the nearly 300,000 square miles that\ncompose Chile. Even more important, Mr. Abbott has no\npower whatever to select another country in which A. J. A.\nwould live, were Mr. Abbott\u2019s work to take him to another\ncountry altogether. In sum, a right to object to a proposed\ndeparture gives a parent far less authority than a right to\ndetermine where the child shall reside. Moreover, the\nright to determine where to live within a country, as well\nas what country to live in, is far broader than the limited\nright to object to a child\u2019s travel abroad.\n  In my view, the \u201cright\u201d Mr. Abbott has by virtue of the\ntravel restriction is therefore best understood as relating\nto his \u201crights of access,\u201d as the Convention defines that\nterm\u2014and not as a standalone \u201c \u2018righ[t] of custody,\u2019 \u201d as the\nCourt defines it, ante, at 1. Chile\u2019s statutory travel re\u00ad\nstriction provision is plainly ancillary to the access rights\nthe Chilean family court granted to him as the noncusto\u00ad\ndial parent. By its terms, the obligation on the custodial\nparent to seek the other parent\u2019s permission before remov\u00ad\ning the child from Chile only operates upon the award of\nvisitation rights; it has nothing to do with custody rights.\nAnd it operates automatically to facilitate the noncusto\u00ad\ndial parent\u2019s ability to access the child and to exercise his\nvisitation rights. In the best of all possible circumstances,\nMr. Abbott\u2019s limited veto power assures him relatively\neasy access to A. J. A. so that he may continue a meaning\u00ad\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

But this power, standing\nalone, does not transform him into a custodian for pur\u00ad\nposes of the Convention\u2019s return remedy. Instead, it au\u00ad\nthorizes him, pursuant to Article 21, to seek assistance\nfrom this country in carrying out the Chilean family\ncourt\u2019s visitation order.\n                              III\n  Although the Court recognizes, as it must, that \u201c \u2018[t]he\ninterpretation of a treaty, like the interpretation of a\nstatute, begins with its text,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 6 (quoting Medell\u00edn,\n552 U. S., at 506), the Court\u2019s analysis is atextual\u2014at\nleast as far as the Convention\u2019s text goes. The Court first\nrelies on the text of the Chilean law at issue and a single\nChilean administrator\u2019s alleged interpretation thereof.9\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Because   differences in statutory provisions, as well as cultural\ndifferences and personal predilections, may affect the opinions of local\nofficials, I would attach no weight to the letter from Paula Strap\nCamus, describing Article 49 of Chile\u2019s Minors Law 16,618 as establish\u00ad\ning a shared right to determine the place of residence of a child.\nMoreover, we have no obligation to defer, on questions of treaty inter\u00ad\npretation, to the nonjudicial decisions of another signatory state, let\nalone a return request\u2014a piece of advocacy\u2014filed on behalf of Chile in\nanother case.\n   In any event, the letter cited offers much less support for the Court\u2019s\nposition than meets the eye. Unlike in this case, in which a Chilean\ncourt has already decreed Ms. Abbott to be A. J. A.\u2019s sole custodian, in\nVillegas Duran v. Beaumont, \u201cno Judge of the Republic of Chile has\ngranted the custody of the child to her mother . . . .\u201d Letter from Paula\nStrap Camus, Director General, Corporation of Judicial Assistance of\nthe Region Metropolitana to National Center for Missing and Exploited\nChildren (Jan. 17, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in Villegas Duran v.\nBeaumont, O. T. 2008, No. 08\u2013775, p. 36a. In other words, Ms. Camus\u2019\nletter request for the child\u2019s return in that case depends on a provision\nof Article 49 not at issue in this case: \u201cIf the custody of a legitimate\nchild has not been entrusted by the judge to any of his parents or to a\nthird party, the child may not leave without authorization of both\nparents.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The travel restriction that bound\nMs. Abbott in this case, however, arose \u201c[o]nce the court . . . decreed the\nobligation to allow visits\u201d by Mr. Abbott. Ibid. Although not before us,\n16                        ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nSee ante, at 6. While it is true that the meaning of Chile\u2019s\nstatute matters to our determining whether a parent has\ntaken a child in \u201cbreach of rights of custody . . . under the\nlaw of the State in which the child was habitually resident\nimmediately before the removal or retention,\u201d Art. 3(a),\nTreaty Doc., at 7, it does not and should not inform what\nthe Convention\u2019s definition of \u201crights of custody\u201d means in\nthe first place.\n  The Court also reminds us that the Convention\u2019s terms\nare to be broadly construed. See ante, at 15\u201316. To be\nsure, the Convention\u2019s leading interpretive authority\ninforms us that the Convention\u2019s understanding of what\nconstitutes \u201crights of custody\u201d is broad and flexible. See\nP\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b6\u00b667, 71, 84, at 446, 447, 451\u2013452.\nAnd we are to apply its terms to \u201callo[w] the greatest\npossible number of cases to be brought into consideration.\u201d\nId., \u00b667, at 446. But such breadth should not circumvent\nthe Convention\u2019s text in order to sweep a travel restriction\nunder the umbrella of rights of custody.\n  A reading as broad and flexible as the Court\u2019s eviscer\u00ad\nates the distinction the Convention draws between rights\nof custody and rights of access. Indeed, the Court\u2019s read\u00ad\ning essentially voids the Convention\u2019s Article 21, which\nprovides a separate remedy for breaches of rights of ac\u00ad\ncess. If a violation of this type of provision were not a\nbreach of the rights of access, I find it quite difficult to\nimagine what the Convention\u2019s drafters had in mind when\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthere may be a sound basis for distinguishing the legal effect and\nsignificance of a travel restriction in effect prior to an award of custody\nto either or both parents, from one that occurs ancillary to the award of\nvisitation rights to a parent who has no custodial rights. Moreover, the\nU. S. Department of State, at the time the Convention was ratified,\nbelieved that the Convention would require return in these circum\u00ad\nstances: \u201cChildren who are wrongfully removed or retained prior to the\nentry of a custody order are protected by the Convention. There need\nnot be a custody order in effect in order to invoke the Convention\u2019s\nreturn provisions.\u201d Convention Analysis 10505.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

The drafters obviously contemplated that\nsome removals might be in violation of the law of the\nchild\u2019s home nation, but not \u201cwrongful\u201d within the mean\u00ad\ning of the Convention\u2014i.e., not in breach of \u201crights of\ncustody.\u201d This is precisely why Article 5 carefully deline\u00ad\nates between the two types of parental rights in the first\nplace. And this is precisely why Article 21 exists.\n   Nevertheless, the Court has now decreed that whenever\nan award of visitation rights triggers a statutory default\ntravel restriction provision, or is accompanied by a travel\nrestriction by judicial order, a parent possess a right of\ncustody within the meaning of the Convention. Such a\nbright-line rule surely will not serve the best interests of\nthe child in many cases. See P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b625, at\n432. It will also have surprising results. In Chile, for\nexample, as a result of this Court\u2019s decision, all parents\u2014\nso long as they have the barest of visitation rights\u2014now\nalso have joint custody within the meaning of the Conven\u00ad\ntion and the right to utilize the return remedy.10\n   It bears emphasis that such a result\u2014treating the type\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 In 2003, the latest year for which statistics appear available,\n\nChile\u2019s Central Authority, which is the entity responsible for adminis\u00ad\ntering its obligations under the Hague Convention, made five outgoing\n\u201caccess applications\u201d under Article 21.

Doc. No. 3, 2006\u20132007) (hereinaf\u00ad\nter Lowe Analysis). Were the Court correct\u2014and were the view the\nCourt ascribes to Chile\u2019s interpretation of its own law also correct, see\nante, at 6\u20137\u2014all of Chile\u2019s outgoing applications under the Convention\nalmost certainly should have been \u201creturn applications\u201d because any\nperson with rights of access under Chilean law, also has a right of\ncustody by virtue of the statutory ne exeat provision. It is plain that\neven Chilean officials have not thought correct the Court\u2019s interpreta\u00ad\ntion of the intersection of the travel restriction in Article 49 of its\nMinors Law 16,618 and the Convention.\n18                      ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof travel restriction at issue in this case as part of \u201crights\nof custody\u201d\u2014will undermine the Convention\u2019s careful\nbalance between the \u201crights of custody and the \u201crights of\naccess\u201d:\n       \u201cAlthough the problems which can arise from a breach\n       of access rights, especially where the child is taken\n       abroad by its custodian, were raised during the Four\u00ad\n       teenth Session, the majority view was that such situa\u00ad\n       tions could not be put in the same category as the\n       wrongful removals which it is sought to prevent.\n       \u201cThis example, and others like it where breach of ac\u00ad\n       cess rights profoundly upsets the equilibrium estab\u00ad\n       lished by a judicial or administrative decision, cer\u00ad\n       tainly demonstrate that decisions concerning the\n       custody of children should always be open to review.\n       This problem however defied all efforts the Hague\n       Conference to coordinate views thereon. A question\u00ad\n       able result would have been attained had the applica\u00ad\n       tion of the Convention, by granting the same degree of\n       protection to custody and access rights, led ultimately\n       to the substitution of the holders of one type of right by\n       those who held the other.\u201d Id., \u00b665, at 445 (emphasis\n       added; footnote omitted).\nIt seems the very same authority on which the Court\nrelies to support its broad, flexible reading of the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s terms also tell us that the drafters expressly rejected\nthe very outcome the Court reaches today. Far from \u201cren\u00ad\nder[ing] the Convention meaningless,\u201d ante, at 9, a faithful\nreading of the Convention\u2019s text avoids the very \u201cquestion\u00ad\nable result\u201d its drafters foresaw and attempted to preclude\nwere they to extend \u201cthe same degree of protection\u201d \u201cto\ncustody and access rights.\u201d P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b665, at 445.\n                             IV\n     Hence, in my view, the Convention\u2019s language is plain\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

In this case,\nit appears that both are true: The Department of State\u2019s\nposition, which supports the Court\u2019s conclusion, is newly\nmemorialized, see Brief for United States as Amicus Cu\u00ad\nriae 21, n. 13, and is possibly inconsistent with the De\u00ad\npartment\u2019s earlier position, see Convention Analysis\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 See Art. 32, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23,\n\n1969, 1155 U.

This does not seem\nto be a matter in which deference to the Executive on\nmatters of foreign policy would avoid international con\u00ad\nflict, cf. Itel Containers Int\u2019l Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S.\n60, 76 (1993) (acknowledging that \u201cthe nuances of foreign\npolicy \u2018are much more the province of the Executive\nBranch and Congress than of this Court\u2019 \u201d (quoting Con\u00ad\ntainer Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S.\n159, 196 (1983))); the State Department has made no such\nargument. Nor is this a case in which the Executive\u2019s\nunderstanding of the treaty\u2019s drafting history is particu\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   12 The State Department explained to the Senate at the time it sought\n\nratification of the Convention that the \u201cfundamental purpose of the\nHague Convention\u201d was \u201cto protect children from wrongful interna\u00ad\ntional removals or retentions by persons bent on obtaining their physi\u00ad\ncal and/or legal custody.\u201d Convention Analysis 10504. I find it quite\nunlikely, in light of its framing of the \u201cfundamental purpose\u201d of the\nConvention, that the State Department would have agreed at the time\nthat a removal was \u201cwrongful\u201d within the meaning of the Convention\nwhen a parent with physical custody of a child took that child to an\u00ad\nother country, even when that removal was in violation of a restriction\non the custodial parent\u2019s travel rights. See also Brief for Eleven Law\nProfessors as Amici Curiae 4\u20135, n. 7. Even more telling, however, is\nthe fact that, in a response to a questionnaire used by the Convention\u2019s\ndrafters in preparing the treaty, the United States characterized a\nne exeat right as one with \u201cthe purpose of preserving the jurisdiction of\nthe state in the custody matter and of safeguarding the visitation rights\nof the other parent.\u201d 1980 Conf\u00e9rence de La Haye de droit interna\u00ad\ntional priv\u00e9, Enl\u00e8vement d\u2019enfants, Replies of the Governments to the\nQuestionnaire, in 3 Actes et Documents de la Quatorzi\u00e8me session, pp.\n85, 88 (1982).

Thus, we have no informed basis to\nassess the Executive\u2019s postratification conduct, or the\nconduct of other signatories, to aid us in understanding\nthe accepted meaning of potentially ambiguous terms. See\nZicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U. S. 217, 227\u2013228\n(1996) (considering \u201cpostratification conduct of the con\u00ad\ntracting parties\u201d); Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U.

I understand the Court\u2019s reference to contemporary\nconsensus to depend on the views of contemporary scholars and indi\u00ad\nvidual signatory states developed postratification, including the views\nof the Special Commission, a voluntary post hac collective body with no\ntreaty-making authority, see ibid. Even assuming that the Court is\ncorrect that consensus has emerged after the Convention was written\nand ratified that ne exeat rights should be \u201crights of custody,\u201d in my\nview this provides no support at all for the position that the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s drafters had these types of rights in mind and intended for the\nConvention to treat them as rights of custody. To the contrary, I think\nit tends to prove the opposite point.\n   14 This is somewhat surprising given that in 1999 the Department\n\nmade 212 outgoing applications for return of children to the United\nStates and made 85 such requests in 2003.

Its view is informed by no\nunique vantage it has, whether as the entity responsible\nfor enforcing the Convention in this country or as a par\u00ad\nticipating drafter. The Court\u2019s perfunctory, one-paragraph\ntreatment of the Department\u2019s judgment of this matter\nonly underscores this point. Ante, at 11\u201312. I see no\nreason, therefore, to replace our understanding of the\nConvention\u2019s text with that of the Executive Branch.\n   Views of foreign jurisdictions. The Court believes that\nthe views of our sister signatories to the Convention de\u00ad\nserve special attention when, in a case like this, \u201cCongress\nhas directed that \u2018uniform international interpretation\u2019 of\nthe Convention is part of the Convention\u2019s framework.\u201d\nAnte, at 12 (quoting 42 U.

And the\nhandful of foreign decisions the Court cites, see ante, at\n12\u201313, provide insufficient reason to depart from my\nunderstanding of the meaning of the Convention, an un\u00ad\nderstanding shared by many U.

See,\ne.g., 542 F. 3d 1081 (CA5 2008) (case below); Gonzalez v.\nGutierrez, 311 F. 3d 942, 949 (CA9 2002) (parent\u2019s right to\n\u201crefuse permission for his children to leave Mexico\u201d\n\u201chardly amounts to a right of custody, in the plainest\nsense of the term\u201d); Croll, 229 F. 3d, at 140 (\u201cIf we were to\nenforce rights held pursuant to a ne exeat clause by the\nremedy of mandatory return, the Convention would be\u00ad\ncome unworkable. . . .

The various\ndecisions of the international courts are, at best, in equi\u00ad\npoise. Indeed, the Court recognizes that courts in Canada\nand France have concluded that travel restrictions are not\n\u201crights of custody\u201d within the meaning of the Convention.\nAnte, at 13\u201314.\n   And those decisions supportive of the Court\u2019s position do\nnot offer nearly as much support as first meets the eye.\nFor example, the English High Court of Justice decision\non which the Court primarily relies, ante, at 12, appears to\nhave decided a different issue. True, that court considered\nthe effect of a similar travel restriction on both parents\nfollowing the award of \u201ccustody\u201d to the child\u2019s mother. C.\nv. C., [1989] 1 W. L. R. 654, 656 (C. A.). But the family\ncourt had also decreed, at the time it awarded \u201ccustody\u201d to\nthe mother, that both parents would remain \u201c \u2018joint guardi\u00ad\nans\u2019 \u201d of the child. Ibid. Moreover, in the time between\nthe mother\u2019s removal of the child and the father\u2019s petition\u00ad\ning for his return, the father had returned to the Family\nCourt in Sydney, obtained an order for the child\u2019s return,\nand received immediate custody of the child. Ibid. Com\u00ad\nparable facts do not exist in this case. Cf. Olympic Air\u00ad\nways, 540 U. S., at 655, n. 9 (noting that \u201cwe are hesitant\u201d\nto follow decisions of sister signatory courts when \u201cthere\nare substantial factual distinctions between\u201d the cases).\n24                        ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nSimilar factual distinctions\u2014involving, typically, joint\nguardianship rights or shared decisionmaking rights\u2014are\npresent in other of the foreign cases relied upon by the\nCourt and Mr. Abbott.15\n   Those foreign courts that have reached a position con\u00ad\nsistent with my own, the Court is right to point out, have\nalso done so in slightly different factual scenarios. Ante,\nat 13\u201314. The Supreme Court of Canada, for example,\nfirst encountered a ne exeat provision as part of an interim\ncustody order in Thomson v. Thomson, [1994] 3 S. C. R.\n551, 589\u2013590, 119 D. L. R. (4th) 253, 281. Although the\nCanadian high court concluded that a removal in breach of\nthe temporary travel restriction was wrongful, it empha\u00ad\nsized the interim nature of the provision, see n. 9, supra,\nand explained that the case would be different with a\npermanent order. See Thomson, 3 S. C. R., at 589, 119\nD. L. R., at 281 (\u201cSuch a [permanent] clause raises quite\ndifferent issues. It is usually intended to ensure perma\u00ad\nnent access to the non-custodial parent. The right of\naccess is, of course, important but, as we have seen, it was\nnot intended to be given the same level of protection by\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 See Bundesverfassungsgericht [BVerfG] [Fed.

S. v.\nV. W., [1996] 2 S. C. R. 108, 139, 134 D. L. R. (4th) 481,\n503 (rejecting argument that \u201cany removal of a child\nwithout the consent of the parent having access rights\u201d\nshould authorize return remedy because such a reading of\nthe Convention would \u201cindirectly afford the same protec\u00ad\ntion to access rights as is afforded to custody rights\u201d).\n   In sum, the decisions relied upon by the Court and Mr.\nAbbott from our sister signatories do not convince me that\nwe should refrain from a straightforward textual analysis\nin this case in order to make way for a \u201cuniform interna\u00ad\ntional interpretation\u201d of the Convention. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a711601(b)(3)(B). There is no present uniformity suffi\u00ad\nciently substantial to justify departing from our independ\u00ad\nent judgment on the Convention\u2019s text and purpose and\nthe drafters\u2019 intent.\n                              V\n   At bottom, the Convention aims to protect the best\ninterests of the child. P\u00e9rez-Vera Report \u00b625, at 432.\nRecognizing that not all removals in violation of the laws\nof the country of habitual residence are contrary to a\nchild\u2019s best interests, the Convention provides a powerful\nbut limited return remedy. The judgment of the Conven\u00ad\ntion\u2019s drafters was that breaches of access rights, while\nsignificant (and thus expressly protected by Article 21),\nare secondary to protecting the child\u2019s interest in main\u00ad\ntaining an existing custodial relationship.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 The Canadian high court also observed that construing a perma\u00ad\n\nnent travel restriction on one parent as creating a right of custody in\nthe other has \u201cserious implications of the mobility rights of the custo\u00ad\ndian.\u201d Thomson, 3 S. C. R., at 590, 119 D. L. R., at 281. A French\nCourt of Appeals made a similar observation in Attorney for the Repub\u00ad\nlic at P\u00e9rigueux v. Mrs. S, T. G. I. P\u00e9rigueux, Mar. 17, 1992, Rev. cr. dr.\ninternat. Priv\u00e9 82(4) Oct.\u2013D\u00e9c. 1993, 650, 651\u2013653.\n26                  ABBOTT v. ABBOTT\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  Today, the Court has upended the considered judgment\nof the Convention\u2019s drafters in favor of protecting the\nrights of noncustodial parents. In my view, the bright-line\nrule the Court adopts today is particularly unwise in the\ncontext of a treaty intended to govern disputes affecting\nthe welfare of children.\n  I, therefore, respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
