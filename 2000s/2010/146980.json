STEPHEN \n\n              UPTON, WARDEN \n\nON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES\n     COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n              No. 09\u20138852. Decided May 24, 2010\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced\nto death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his\nlawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they\nfailed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suf\nfered as a child. The state court rejected that claim after\nmaking a finding that the attorneys were advised by an\nexpert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under\nthe governing federal statute, that factual finding is pre\nsumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013(8) (1994 ed.). But the Court\nof Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifi\ncally \u00a72254(d)(8)). And on that basis, it considered itself\n\u201cduty-bound\u201d to accept the state court\u2019s finding, and re\njected Jefferson\u2019s claim. Because the Court of Appeals did\nnot fully consider several remaining potentially applicable\nexceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.\n                              I\n  When Jefferson was a child, he \u201csuffered a serious in\njury to his head.\u201d Jefferson v. Terry, 490 F. Supp. 2d 1261,\n1326 (ND Ga. 2007); see id., at 1320 (quoting Jefferson\u2019s\nmother\u2019s testimony that \u201ca car ran over the top of his\nhead\u201d when he was two years old). The accident left his\nskull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly\nscarred. Jefferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1311, 1315, n. 4\n(CA11 2009) (Carnes, J., dissenting). During the District\nCourt proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified\n2                    JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthat, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has \u201cperma\nnent brain damage\u201d that \u201ccauses abnormal behavior\u201d over\nwhich he \u201chas no or substantially limited control.\u201d 490\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1321\u20131322. According to these experts,\nJefferson\u2019s condition causes \u201c \u2018emotional dullness,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018rest\nless or aggressive characteristics,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018impulsiveness,\u2019 \u201d\n\u201c \u2018temper outbursts,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018markedly diminished impulse\ncontrol,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018impaired social judgment,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018transient\noutbursts of rage which are totally inconsistent with his\nnormal behavioral pattern.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1322, 1327.\n    The experts further testified that Jefferson\u2019s \u201c \u2018severe\ncognitive disabilities\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018profoundly alter\u2019 \u201d his \u201c \u2018ability to\nplan and coordinate his actions, to be aware of the conse\nquences of his behavior, and to engage in premeditated or\nintentional acts.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1327. But they testified he is\nneither psychotic nor retarded. Id., at 1319. Thus, they\nsaid, to a lay observer or even to a professional psycholo\ngist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally im\npaired. Indeed, according to the experts, \u201c \u2018the behavior\nthat may result from\u2019 \u201d his condition \u201c \u2018could, without the\nadministration of proper testing, be mistaken for voli\ntional.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1322.\n    Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co\nworker while the two men were fishing. Id., at 1271\u20131272.\nPrior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named\nDr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which\nhe concluded that Jefferson\u2019s mental deficiencies do not\nimpair \u201c \u2018his judgment or decision-making capacity.\u2019 \u201d 570\nF. 3d, at 1294 (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley\u2019s report\nincluded a caveat: \u201c \u2018One possibility that could not be\nexplored because of [Jefferson\u2019s] incarceration has to do\nwith the sequelae,\u2019 \u201d i.e., pathologies, related to a \u201c \u2018head\ninjury experienced during childhood.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. \u201c \u2018In my\nopinion,\u2019 \u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2018it would be worthwhile to conduct\nneuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out\nan organic etiology,\u2019 \u201d i.e., to rule out brain damage. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n   Although \u201cit is undisputed that the testing\u201d Dr. Dudley\nrecommended \u201ccould have easily been performed,\u201d 490\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson\u2019s attorneys pos\nsessed police reports and hospital records recounting his\nhead injury, id., at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jef\nferson tested. At sentencing, they presented only testi\nmony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson\nwas an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of\nJefferson\u2019s family, who testified that he is a \u201cresponsible,\ngenerous, gentle, and kind\u201d person and \u201ca good father.\u201d\n570 F. 3d, at 1290\u20131291. And while Jefferson\u2019s mother\nbriefly mentioned the car accident, \u201cshe was not ques\ntioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the\nimpact, if any, that the accident had on him.\u201d Id., at 1291.\nThus, \u201c[a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson did not suffer\nfrom brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no\norganic disorders\u201d; and \u201chis emotional stability, impulse\ncontrol, and judgment were perfectly normal.\u201d Id., at 1311\n(Carnes, J., dissenting).\n   Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing\nthat his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue\nbrain-damage testing. In response, the trial attorneys\ntestified that they did not pursue such testing because,\nafter delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later\ntold them that further investigation \u201c \u2018may be a waste of\ntime because the rest of [his] report\u2019 \u201d had \u201c \u2018said that\n[Jefferson] was non psychotic.\u2019 \u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1295 (quot\ning testimony). Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the\nhearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that\nhe had ever made such statements. He said \u201cit had al\nways been his expert opinion \u2018that neuropsychological\ntesting was necessary\u2019 \u201d and that when he wrote as much\nin his formal report \u201che \u2018meant it.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1312 (Carnes,\nJ., dissenting) (quoting affidavit). He added, \u201c \u2018I never,\nbefore or after that report, suggested to [Jefferson\u2019s attor\nneys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it\n4                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nwould not be worthwhile.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.; cf. Pet. for Cert. 17,\nn. 12.\n   Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that\nafter the hearing concluded the state-court judge con\ntacted the attorneys for the State ex parte. And in a pri\nvate conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his\nattorneys, the judge asked the State\u2019s attorneys to draft\nthe opinion of the court. See id., at 3, 12. According to\nJefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he\ninformed of the request made to opposing counsel. Id., at\n12, n. 8, 13; see also Jefferson v. Zant, 263 Ga. 316, 431\nS. E. 2d 110, 111 (1993) (\u201cJefferson contends [the order]\namounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which\n[he] has not had a chance to respond\u201d).\n   The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding\nthat \u201cDr. Dudley led [Jefferson\u2019s trial attorneys] to believe\nthat further investigation would simply be a waste of time\nbecause Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.\u201d Jefferson v. Zant,\nCiv. Action No. 87\u2013V\u20131241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga.,\nOct. 7, 1992), p. 16, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter\nState Order); see also id., at 37. The opinion \u201cspecifically\ncredits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to\ntheir efforts to investigate Petitioner\u2019s mental condition.\u201d\nId., at 18; see also id., at 36. And relying on these find\nings, it concludes that Jefferson\u2019s attorneys \u201cmade a rea\nsonable investigation into [his] mental health\u201d and were\nthus not ineffective. Id., at 37.\n   Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged,\nthe State\u2019s opinion discusses statements purportedly made\non Jefferson\u2019s behalf by a witness \u201cwho did not testify\u201d or\nparticipate in the proceedings. 263 Ga., at 318, 431 S. E.\n2d, at 112; see State Order 24\u201325. Nonetheless, the opin\nion \u201cwas adopted verbatim by the [state] court.\u201d 263 Ga.,\nat 316, 431 S. E. 2d, at 111. And while the State Supreme\nCourt recognized that we have \u201c \u2018criticized\u2019 \u201d such a prac\ntice, it affirmed the judgment. Id., at 317, 320, 431 S. E.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\n2d, at 112, 114 (quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470\nU. S. 564, 572 (1985)).\n                               II\n   Jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the Dis\ntrict Court. In his opening brief, he argued that \u201cthere is\nno reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give\nany deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus\nCourt.\u201d Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96\u2013CV\u2013989\u2013CC (ND\nGa.), Doc. 105, p. 4, and n. 1 (hereinafter District Court\nBrief). In support of that argument, he claimed that the\nstate court \u201cmerely signed an order drafted by the State\nwithout revision of a single word,\u201d even though the order\n\u201cdescribed witnesses who never testified.\u201d Ibid. And he\nsaid that such a process \u201crais[es] serious doubts as to\nwhether [the judge] even read, much less carefully consid\nered, the proposed order submitted by the State.\u201d Ibid.\n   The District Court ruled in Jefferson\u2019s favor. It noted\nthat under the relevant statute \u201cfactual findings of state\ncourts are presumed to be correct unless one of . . . eight\nenumerated exceptions . . . applies.\u201d 490 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1280; see also id., at 1280, n. 5 (listing the exceptions).\nAnd it acknowledged \u201cthe state habeas corpus court\u2019s\nfailure to explain the basis\u201d for its credibility findings. Id.,\nat 1324, n. 17. But it accepted Jefferson\u2019s claim of ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel without disturbing the state\ncourt\u2019s factual findings because it believed he should\nprevail even accepting those findings as true. Id., at\n1324\u20131325.\n   On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court\u2019s judg\nment primarily on its own terms. But he also argued that\nthe state court\u2019s factfinding was \u201cdubious at best\u201d in light\nof the process that court employed, and that the Court of\nAppeals therefore \u201cshould harbor serious doubts about the\nfindings of fact and credibility determinations in the state\ncourt record.\u201d Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07\u2013\n6                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n12502 (CA11), pp. 31\u201332, n. 10 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).\n  A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jeffer\nson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his\nclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel. And, in so doing,\nhe challenges\u2014as he did in the State Supreme Court, the\nDistrict Court, and the Court of Appeals\u2014\u201cthe fact find\nings of the state court,\u201d given what he describes as the\ndeficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing\nhis claim. Pet. for Cert. 11\u201313, 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13 (re\ncounting \u201c \u2018reason[s] to doubt\u2019 \u201d the state court\u2019s findings).\nCf. Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,\n513 U. S. 374, 379 (1995) (stating standard for preserving\nan issue for review in this Court).\n                               III\n   This habeas application was filed prior to the enactment\nof the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 and is therefore governed by federal habeas law as it\nexisted prior to that point. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U. S.\n320, 326\u2013336 (1997). In 1963, we set forth the \u201cappropri\nate standard\u201d to be applied by a \u201cfederal court in habeas\ncorpus\u201d when \u201cthe facts\u201d pertinent to a habeas application\n\u201care in dispute.\u201d Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312.\nWe held that when \u201cthe habeas applicant was afforded a\nfull and fair hearing by the state court resulting in reliable\nfindings\u201d the district court \u201cordinarily should . . . accept\nthe facts as found\u201d by the state-court judge. Id., at 318.\nHowever, \u201cif the habeas applicant did not receive a full\nand fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the\ntime of the trial or in a collateral proceeding,\u201d we held that\nthe federal court \u201cmust hold an evidentiary hearing\u201d to\nresolve any facts that \u201care in dispute.\u201d Id., at 312. We\nfurther \u201cexplain[ed] the controlling criteria\u201d by enumerat\ning six circumstances in which such an evidentiary hear\ning would be required:\n    \u201c(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\n    in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determina\n    tion is not fairly supported by the record as a whole;\n    (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state\n    court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hear\n    ing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly dis\n    covered evidence; (5) the material facts were not ade\n    quately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for\n    any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not\n    afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hear\n    ing.\u201d Id., at 313 (emphasis added).\n  Three years later, in 1966, Congress enacted an\namendment to the federal habeas statute that \u201cwas an\nalmost verbatim codification of the standards delineated\nin Townsend v. Sain.\u201d Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 111\n(1985). That codification read in relevant part as follows:\n      \u201cIn any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by\n    an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person\n    in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,\n    a determination . . . of a factual issue, made by a State\n    court of competent jurisdiction . . . , shall be presumed\n    to be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or\n    it shall otherwise appear, or the respondent shall\n    admit\u2014\n      \u201c(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not\n    resolved in the State court hearing;\n      \u201c(2) that the factfinding procedure employed by the\n    State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair\n    hearing;\n      \u201c(3) that the material facts were not adequately de\n    veloped at the State court hearing;\n      \u201c(4) that the State court lacked jurisdiction of the\n    subject matter or over the person of the applicant in\n    the State court proceeding;\n      \u201c(5) that the applicant was an indigent and the\n    State court, in deprivation of his constitutional right,\n8                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the State\n    court proceeding;\n       \u201c(6) that the applicant did not receive a full, fair,\n    and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding; or\n       \u201c(7) that the applicant was otherwise denied due\n    process of law in the State court proceeding;\n       \u201c(8) or unless . . . the Federal court on a considera\n    tion of [the relevant] part of the record as a whole con\n    cludes that such factual determination is not fairly\n    supported by the record.\u201d \u00a72254(d) (emphasis added).\nAs is clear from the statutory text quoted above, and as\nthe District Court correctly stated, if any \u201cone of the eight\nenumerated exceptions . . . applies\u201d then \u201cthe state court\u2019s\nfactfinding is not presumed correct.\u201d 490 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1280; accord, Miller, supra, at 105 (\u201cUnder 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d), state-court findings of fact \u2018shall be presumed to\nbe correct\u2019 in a federal habeas corpus proceeding unless\none of eight enumerated exceptions applies\u201d); see also 1 R.\nHertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and\nProcedure \u00a720.2c, pp. 915\u2013918 (5th ed. 2005).\n  Jefferson has consistently argued that the federal courts\n\u201cshould harbor serious doubts about\u201d and should not \u201cgive\nany deference to\u201d the \u201cfindings of fact and credibility\ndeterminations\u201d made by the state habeas court because\nthose findings were drafted exclusively by the attorneys\nfor the State pursuant to an ex parte request from the\nstate-court judge, who made no such request of Jefferson,\nfailed to notify Jefferson of the request made to opposing\ncounsel, and adopted the State\u2019s proposed opinion verba\ntim even though it recounted evidence from a nonexistent\nwitness. See, e.g., Appeals Brief 32, n. 10; District Court\nBrief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. 12. These are arguments that\nthe state court\u2019s process was deficient. In other words,\nthey are arguments that Jefferson \u201cdid not receive a full\nand fair evidentiary hearing in . . . state court.\u201d Town\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Or, to use the statutory language,\nthey are arguments that the state court\u2019s \u201cfactfinding\nprocedure,\u201d \u201chearing,\u201d and \u201cproceeding\u201d were not \u201cfull,\nfair, and adequate.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(2), (6), (7).\n   But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state\ncourt\u2019s process when it applied the statutory presumption\nof correctness. Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that\napplied only paragraph (8) of \u00a72254(d), which, codifying\nthe second Townsend exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the\npresumption of correctness for findings that are \u201cnot fairly\nsupported by the record.\u201d See 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (quoting\nJackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in\nturn quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(8)). And even though\nthe Court of Appeals \u201crecognize[d]\u201d that Jefferson had\nargued that the state court\u2019s process had produced factual\nfindings that were \u201c \u2018dubious at best,\u2019 \u201d and that federal\ncourts should therefore \u201c \u2018harbor serious doubts about\u2019 \u201d the\nstate court\u2019s \u201c \u2018findings of fact and credibility,\u2019 \u201d the Court\nof Appeals nonetheless held that the state court\u2019s findings\nare \u201c \u2018entitled to a presumption of correctness\u2019 \u201d that it was\n\u201cduty-bound\u201d to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting\nAppeals Brief 32, n. 10). The Court of Appeals explicitly\nstated that it considered itself \u201cduty-bound\u201d to defer to the\nstate court\u2019s findings because \u201cJefferson has not argued\nthat any of the state courts\u2019 factual findings were \u2018not\nfairly supported by the record,\u2019 \u201d a direct reference to\n\u00a72254(d)(8) and to the second Townsend exception. 570\nF. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then con\ncluded: \u201cBased on these factual findings of the state ha\nbeas courts\u2014all of which are fairly supported by the re\ncord\u2014we believe that Jefferson\u2019s counsel were reasonable\nin deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.\u201d Id.,\nat 1304 (emphasis added).\n   In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly con\nsider the legal status of the state court\u2019s factual findings.\nUnder Townsend, as codified by the governing statute, a\n10                 JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfederal court is not \u201cduty-bound\u201d to accept any and all\nstate-court findings that are \u201cfairly supported by the\nrecord.\u201d Those words come from \u00a72254(d)(8), which is only\none of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of\ncorrectness. But there are seven others, see \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013\n(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when\naddressing Jefferson\u2019s claim. To be sure, we have previ\nously stated in cases applying \u00a72254(d)(8) that \u201ca federal\ncourt\u201d may not overturn a state court\u2019s factual conclusion\n\u201cunless the conclusion is not \u2018fairly supported by the re\ncord.\u2019 \u201d Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991) (grant\ning federal habeas relief after rejecting state court\u2019s find\ning under \u00a72254(d)(8)); see also Demosthenes v. Baal, 495\nU. S. 731 (1990) (per curiam) (applying \u00a72254(d)(8)); cf.\npost, at 10 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But in those cases\nthere was no suggestion that any other provisions enu\nmerated in \u00a72254(d) were at issue. That is not the case\nhere. In treating \u00a72254(d)(8) as the exclusive statutory\nexception, and by failing to address Jefferson\u2019s argument\nthat the state court\u2019s procedures deprived its findings of\ndeference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and\nour precedents incorrectly.\n   Although we have stated that a court\u2019s \u201cverbatim adop\ntion of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties\u201d\nshould be treated as findings of the court, we have also\ncriticized that practice. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572. And\nwe have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the applica\ntion of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice\nwhere (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte,\n(2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to\ncriticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts\nfindings that contain internal evidence suggesting that\nthe judge may not have read them. Cf. id., at 568; Ga.\nCode of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibit\ning ex parte judicial communications).\n   We decline to determine in the first instance whether\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Decided May 24, 2010\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\ndissenting.\n   The question presented by Jefferson\u2019s petition for writ of\ncertiorari is whether his trial attorneys rendered ineffec\ntive assistance of counsel when they declined to pursue\nfurther investigation of Jefferson\u2019s childhood head injury.\nIn my view the Court should either answer that question\nor (as I would prefer) deny the petition. Instead, it sum\nmarily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals on an\naltogether different ground that was neither raised nor\npassed upon below and that is not fairly included within\nthe sole question presented. To make matters worse, the\nCourt conjures up an \u201cerror\u201d with respect to that ground\nby misquoting and mischaracterizing the Court of Appeals\u2019\nopinion, ante, at 9\u201310, and by overlooking relevant author\nity from this Court.

The Court concludes that the Eleventh Circuit\n2                      JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmisapplied that provision and our precedents by treating\none of those exceptions, \u00a72254(d)(8), \u201cas the exclusive\nstatutory exception\u201d to the presumption of correctness,\nand by failing to address whether \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or (7)\nmight also bar application of that presumption.1 Ante, at\n10.\n   The Court\u2019s opinion, however, is the first anyone (in\ncluding Jefferson) has heard of this argument. Jefferson\u2019s\nbriefs below contain no discussion or even citation of sub\nsection (d)\u2014let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)\u2014and the\ncourts below understandably never passed upon the appli\ncation of those provisions. Under our longstanding prac\ntice, that should be the end of the matter. See, e.g., Penn\nsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212\u2013\n213 (1998).\n   But the Court insists, ante, at 5\u20136, 8\u20139, that if we squint\nat them long enough we can see in Jefferson\u2019s briefs below\na challenge to the state court\u2019s fact-finding process cogni\nzable under \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), and (7). But the handful of\nisolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds\nof pages of briefs) show no such thing. The Court\u2019s only\nevidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District\nCourt, ante, at 5, 8, consists of a single sentence of text\n(and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the \u201cPrior\nProceedings\u201d section of his 180-page brief.

The sentence is: \u201cIn\nentering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton\nmerely signed an order drafted by the State without revi\nsion of a single word.\u201d Id., at 4. The footnote adds:\n       \u201c[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described wit\n    nesses who never testified, raising serious doubt as to\n    whether he even read, much less carefully considered,\n    the proposed order submitted by the State. In this\n    circumstance, there is no reason under principles of\n    comity or otherwise to give any deference to the find\n    ings of the State Habeas Court, because there was ap\n    parently no serious consideration or deliberation of\n    the factual and legal issues raised.\u201d Ibid., n. 1.\nThis passing suggestion that deference would be unwar\nranted is, to put it mildly, an elliptical way to argue that\nthe state fact-finding procedure was inadequate,\n\u00a72254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and\nadequate hearing, \u00a72254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was de\nnied due process of law, \u00a72254(d)(7). And it only appeared,\nI emphasize again, in the \u201cPrior Proceedings\u201d section of\nthe brief. The argument section of Jefferson\u2019s District\nCourt Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing sepa\nrate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no\nmention of the ground upon which the Court today relies.\nAnd the assignment of error that is the basis for the ques\ntion presented in Jefferson\u2019s petition, VI, id., at 47\u201380, did\nnot dispute the state courts\u2019 factual findings under\n\u00a72254(d), but only challenged the state courts\u2019 legal con\nclusion that his attorneys\u2019 failure to conduct a fuller inves\ntigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not\ndeficient performance under Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U. S. 668 (1984).\n   Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh\nCircuit. His brief to that court acknowledged that the\n4                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstate courts\u2019 \u201c[f]indings of fact and credibility determina\ntions are reviewed for clear error.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner/Appellee, No. 07\u201312502, pp. 16\u201317 (hereinafter\nAppeals Brief). It declared that \u201cThe District Court Cor\nrectly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court\u201d in\nadjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\nId., at 21 (capitalization and boldface type deleted); see\nalso id., at 29, and n. 7, 31. And it conceded that with\nrespect to the ineffective-assistance claim, \u201c[t]he relevant\nfacts are not in dispute.\u201d Id., at 24. Jefferson did charac\nterize the state habeas court\u2019s factual findings as gener\nally \u201cdubious\u201d and suggested there were \u201cserious doubts\u201d\nabout them, id., at 32, n. 10. But not once did he argue\nthat the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence\nof a failure to meet the requirements of \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or\n(7)\u2014or even more generally that the findings should not\nbe presumed correct under \u00a72254(d). Instead, he pressed\nthe same argument he made in the District Court: Even if\nthe state courts\u2019 factual findings were correct, his trial\nattorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to\nforgo further investigation of his childhood head injury.\nId., at 31\u201333, 50\u201351.\n   Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the\nCourt now addresses. The District Court did not dispute\nthe state courts\u2019 factual findings. Jefferson v. Terry, 490\nF. Supp. 2d 1261, 1319\u20131320 (ND Ga. 2007). It accepted\nthose findings as true, including the state habeas court\u2019s\ncredibility findings, id., at 1323\u20131324, and n. 17, but held\n\u201cas a matter of law\u201d that it was objectively unreasonable\nfor Jefferson\u2019s attorneys \u201cnot to investigate\u201d further into\nthe effect, if any, of the accident on Jefferson\u2019s mental\ncapacity and health, id., at 1324. Concluding that Jeffer\nson was thereby prejudiced, the court ordered a new sen\ntencing hearing. Id., at 1328.\n   The Court of Appeals disagreed with that determination\nand reversed, holding that his trial attorneys\u2019 performance\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nwas not objectively unreasonable under Strickland. Jef\nferson v. Hall, 570 F. 3d 1283, 1301\u20131309 (CA11 2009).\nThat court correctly stated the applicable framework\nunder \u00a72254(d):\n       \u201cPre-AEDPA, questions of law and mixed questions\n    of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are re\n    viewed de novo, while the state courts\u2019 factual findings\n    are \u2018subject to the presumption of correctness.\u2019\n    Freund v. Butterworth, 165 F. 3d 839, 861 (11th Cir.\n    1999). Although these findings may be disregarded if,\n    for example, they are not \u2018fairly supported by the re\n    cord,\u2019 Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (11th\n    Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(8)), this Court\n    has construed the \u2018presumption of correctness\u2019 stan\n    dard to be the same as the \u2018clear error\u2019 standard of\n    review.\u201d Id., at 1300 (emphasis added; footnote\n    omitted).\nConfronted with no argument that \u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013(7) applied\nor that it must disregard the state courts\u2019 factual findings,\nthe Court of Appeals understandably did not pass upon\nthose questions.\n  The Court of Appeals did consider the record on its own,\nas required by \u00a72254(d)(8), to determine whether the state\ncourts\u2019 factual determinations were fairly supported by the\nrecord. Id., at 1303\u20131304, and n. 8. In doing so, the court\n\u201cspecifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district\ncourt questioned the state court\u2019s factual finding that [the\ndefense\u2019s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson\u2019s attor\nney\u2019s] to believe that further investigation would simply\nbe a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney\u2019s] testimony\nthat [the expert] told him it \u2018may\u2019 be a waste of time.\u201d Id.,\nat 1303, n. 8. It added that Jefferson did not \u201cpoint to any\nparticular finding that was clearly erroneous,\u201d id., at 1304,\nn. 8\u2014applying the same standard Jefferson had proposed\nin his brief, see supra, at 3. Even the dissent agreed that\n6                  JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe court was \u201cobliged to accept\u201d the state courts\u2019 credibil\nity determination, despite the \u201creasons to doubt it.\u201d 570\nF. 3d, at 1312 (opinion of Carnes, J.). The dissent did not\ncite \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the\nsame question of constitutional law that occupied Jeffer\nson\u2019s briefs, the District Court\u2019s opinion, and the major\nity\u2019s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and\ncredibility determination of the state courts as true, Jef\nferson\u2019s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of coun\nsel.

Nor does that\nquestion necessarily encompass whether the Court of\nAppeals misapplied that version of \u00a72254(d) in determin\ning the deference due to the state courts\u2019 factual findings.\nThe statutory question may be \u201crelated to,\u201d and \u201cperhaps\ncomplementary to the one petitioner presented,\u201d but it is\nnot \u201cfairly included therein.\u201d Yee, supra, at 537 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   As for the body of Jefferson\u2019s petition: Far from invoking\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s exceptions to the presumption of correctness to\nsupport the Sixth Amendment claim, the petition does not\neven mention subsection (d), let alone paragraphs (2), (6),\nor (7). There is no argument, anywhere in the section\nentitled \u201cReasons for Granting the Writ,\u201d that the state\ncourts\u2019 factual findings are not entitled to a presumption\nof correctness.\n   The Court claims, ante, at 6, that Jefferson sufficiently\npresented the statutory issue by his characterizations of\nthe state courts\u2019 factual findings in the \u201cStatement of the\nCase\u201d section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 11\u201313, 17,\nn. 12, 18, n. 13. Even if that were so, \u201c \u2018the fact that [peti\ntioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for\ncertiorari does not bring it before us.

But in any event, the\ncited passages do not remotely present the statutory issue.\nThey contain no argument that \u00a72254(d)\u2019s presumption is\ninapplicable because of \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely\ndescribe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11\u201313,\nand assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state\n8                  JEFFERSON v.

It is true that the major\nity\u2019s opinion\u2014as well as the dissent\u2019s\u2014discussed only\n\u00a72254(d)(8). But that is because only \u00a72254(d)(8), and\nnot \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the\ncourt\u2019s attention. On the fair reading we owe the Elev\nenth Circuit\u2019s opinion, there simply was no error in its\napplication of \u00a72254(d).\n   The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit\nignored the other seven paragraphs in \u00a72254(d) when it\n\u201cinvoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8)\nof \u00a72254(d).\u201d Ante, at 9. It did nothing of the sort. The\nCourt of Appeals said that a state court\u2019s factual findings\n\u201cmay be disregarded if, for example, they are not \u2018fairly\nsupported by the record,\u2019 Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d\n1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(8)).\u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (emphasis added). The\nCourt of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a72254(d)(8) was but one example of the grounds for disre\ngarding a state court\u2019s factual findings. And the Circuit\nprecedent it cited, Jackson v. Herring, similarly did not\nimply, much less hold, that \u00a72254(d)(8) provided the only\ngrounds for setting aside a state court\u2019s factual findings\nunder \u00a72254(d). See 42 F. 3d, at 1366.\n  Next, the Court states:\n    \u201cAnd even though the Court of Appeals \u2018recognize[d]\u2019\n    that Jefferson had argued that the state court\u2019s proc\n    ess had produced factual findings that were \u2018 \u201cdubious\n    at best,\u201d \u2019 and that federal courts should therefore\n    \u2018 \u201charbor serious doubts about\u201d \u2019 the state court\u2019s\n    \u2018 \u201cfindings of fact and credibility,\u201d \u2019 the Court of Ap\n    peals nonetheless held that the state court\u2019s findings\n    are \u2018 \u201centitled to a presumption of correctness\u201d \u2019 that it\n    was \u2018 \u201cduty-bound\u201d \u2019 to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8\n    (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10).\u201d Ante, at 9.\nAgain, the Court has plucked isolated language from here\nand there in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion, to produce a\nreading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed\nwith, or at least did not contest, Jefferson\u2019s claim of \u201cseri\nous doubts.\u201d That is not so. In the first paragraph of\nfootnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was\n\u201cduty-bound to accept\u201d the state courts\u2019 factual findings\nbecause it concluded they \u201care clear, unambiguous, and\nfairly supported by the record.\u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1303\u20131304,\nn. 8. That language precedes the panel\u2019s analysis\u2014in the\nsecond paragraph of footnote eight\u2014regarding Jefferson\u2019s\nstatements that the findings were \u201cdubious\u201d and raised\n\u201cserious doubts.\u201d The Court omits the panel\u2019s actual\nexplanation for declining to credit Jefferson\u2019s general\ncharacterization of the quality of the record, which is:\n\u201cJefferson does not point to any particular factual finding\nthat was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the\nargument section of his brief that, \u2018[t]he relevant facts are\n10                       JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnot in dispute.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1304, n. 8.\n  By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly\ndescribed application of the pre-AEDPA version of\n\u00a72254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that\nwould have been no worse than what we have done. For\nexample, in Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U. S. 731, 735\n(1990) (per curiam), we stated that a federal court may not\noverturn a state habeas court\u2019s factual determinations\n\u201cunless it concludes that they are not \u2018fairly supported by\nthe record.\u2019 See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(8).\u201d And in Parker v.\nDugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991), we explained that a\nfederal habeas court \u201cis not to overturn a factual conclu\nsion of a state court, including a state appellate court,\nunless the conclusion is not \u2018fairly supported by the\nrecord.\u2019 \u201d2\n                       *   *    *\n   Generally speaking, we have no power to set aside the\nduly entered judgment of a lower federal court unless we\nfind it to have been in error. More specifically, except\nwhere there has been an intervening legal development\n(such as a subsequently announced opinion of ours) that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The  Court attempts to distinguish these two cases on the ground\nthat they contained \u201cno suggestion that any other provisions enumer\nated in \u00a72254(d) were at issue,\u201d whereas \u201c[t]hat is not the case here.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. That is simply not so. As already noted, there was no\n\u201csuggestion\u201d here (let alone an actual argument) that paragraphs (2),\n(6), or (7) were in issue. And if the Court means no more than that\npetitioner here made some process-type noises, the same was true\u2014and\nindeed more true\u2014of Parker and Demosthenes. In Parker, we stated\nthe \u201ccrux of [petitioner\u2019s] contentions\u201d was that the state courts \u201cfail[ed]\nto treat adequately\u201d the evidence he presented. 498 U. S., at 313. In\nDemosthenes, the Ninth Circuit had said that the state court\u2019s process\nfor determining whether the capital inmate was competent was defi\ncient because \u201c \u2018a full evidentiary hearing on competence should have\nbeen held.\u2019 \u201d 495 U. S., at 736 (quoting Order in Baal v. Godinez, No.\n90\u201315716 (CA9, June 2, 1990), p. 5).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Decided May 24, 2010\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Petitioner Lawrence Jefferson, who has been sentenced\nto death, claimed in both state and federal courts that his\nlawyers were constitutionally inadequate because they\nfailed to investigate a traumatic head injury that he suf\nfered as a child. The state court rejected that claim after\nmaking a finding that the attorneys were advised by an\nexpert that such investigation was unnecessary. Under\nthe governing federal statute, that factual finding is pre\nsumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013(8) (1994 ed.). But the Court\nof Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifi\ncally \u00a72254(d)(8)).

But they testified he is\nneither psychotic nor retarded. Id., at 1319. Thus, they\nsaid, to a lay observer or even to a professional psycholo\ngist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally im\npaired. Indeed, according to the experts, \u201c \u2018the behavior\nthat may result from\u2019 \u201d his condition \u201c \u2018could, without the\nadministration of proper testing, be mistaken for voli\ntional.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1322.\n    Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co\nworker while the two men were fishing. Id., at 1271\u20131272.\nPrior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named\nDr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which\nhe concluded that Jefferson\u2019s mental deficiencies do not\nimpair \u201c \u2018his judgment or decision-making capacity.\u2019 \u201d 570\nF. 3d, at 1294 (quoting report). But Dr. Dudley\u2019s report\nincluded a caveat: \u201c \u2018One possibility that could not be\nexplored because of [Jefferson\u2019s] incarceration has to do\nwith the sequelae,\u2019 \u201d i.e., pathologies, related to a \u201c \u2018head\ninjury experienced during childhood.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. \u201c \u2018In my\nopinion,\u2019 \u201d he wrote, \u201c \u2018it would be worthwhile to conduct\nneuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out\nan organic etiology,\u2019 \u201d i.e., to rule out brain damage.

Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson\u2019s attorneys pos\nsessed police reports and hospital records recounting his\nhead injury, id., at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jef\nferson tested. At sentencing, they presented only testi\nmony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson\nwas an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of\nJefferson\u2019s family, who testified that he is a \u201cresponsible,\ngenerous, gentle, and kind\u201d person and \u201ca good father.\u201d\n570 F. 3d, at 1290\u20131291.

In response, the trial attorneys\ntestified that they did not pursue such testing because,\nafter delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later\ntold them that further investigation \u201c \u2018may be a waste of\ntime because the rest of [his] report\u2019 \u201d had \u201c \u2018said that\n[Jefferson] was non psychotic.\u2019 \u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1295 (quot\ning testimony).

See, e.g., Appeals Brief 32, n. 10; District Court\nBrief 4, n. 1; Pet. for Cert. 12. These are arguments that\nthe state court\u2019s process was deficient.

Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that\napplied only paragraph (8) of \u00a72254(d), which, codifying\nthe second Townsend exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the\npresumption of correctness for findings that are \u201cnot fairly\nsupported by the record.\u201d See 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (quoting\nJackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in\nturn quoting 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(8)). And even though\nthe Court of Appeals \u201crecognize[d]\u201d that Jefferson had\nargued that the state court\u2019s process had produced factual\nfindings that were \u201c \u2018dubious at best,\u2019 \u201d and that federal\ncourts should therefore \u201c \u2018harbor serious doubts about\u2019 \u201d the\nstate court\u2019s \u201c \u2018findings of fact and credibility,\u2019 \u201d the Court\nof Appeals nonetheless held that the state court\u2019s findings\nare \u201c \u2018entitled to a presumption of correctness\u2019 \u201d that it was\n\u201cduty-bound\u201d to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (quoting\nAppeals Brief 32, n. 10). The Court of Appeals explicitly\nstated that it considered itself \u201cduty-bound\u201d to defer to the\nstate court\u2019s findings because \u201cJefferson has not argued\nthat any of the state courts\u2019 factual findings were \u2018not\nfairly supported by the record,\u2019 \u201d a direct reference to\n\u00a72254(d)(8) and to the second Townsend exception. 570\nF. 3d, at 1304, n. 8 (emphasis added). And it then con\ncluded: \u201cBased on these factual findings of the state ha\nbeas courts\u2014all of which are fairly supported by the re\ncord\u2014we believe that Jefferson\u2019s counsel were reasonable\nin deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.\u201d Id.,\nat 1304 (emphasis added).\n   In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly con\nsider the legal status of the state court\u2019s factual findings.\nUnder Townsend, as codified by the governing statute, a\n10                 JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfederal court is not \u201cduty-bound\u201d to accept any and all\nstate-court findings that are \u201cfairly supported by the\nrecord.\u201d Those words come from \u00a72254(d)(8), which is only\none of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of\ncorrectness. But there are seven others, see \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2013\n(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when\naddressing Jefferson\u2019s claim. To be sure, we have previ\nously stated in cases applying \u00a72254(d)(8) that \u201ca federal\ncourt\u201d may not overturn a state court\u2019s factual conclusion\n\u201cunless the conclusion is not \u2018fairly supported by the re\ncord.\u2019 \u201d Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991) (grant\ning federal habeas relief after rejecting state court\u2019s find\ning under \u00a72254(d)(8)); see also Demosthenes v. Baal, 495\nU. S. 731 (1990) (per curiam) (applying \u00a72254(d)(8)); cf.\npost, at 10 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). But in those cases\nthere was no suggestion that any other provisions enu\nmerated in \u00a72254(d) were at issue. That is not the case\nhere. In treating \u00a72254(d)(8) as the exclusive statutory\nexception, and by failing to address Jefferson\u2019s argument\nthat the state court\u2019s procedures deprived its findings of\ndeference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and\nour precedents incorrectly.\n   Although we have stated that a court\u2019s \u201cverbatim adop\ntion of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties\u201d\nshould be treated as findings of the court, we have also\ncriticized that practice. Anderson, 470 U. S., at 572. And\nwe have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the applica\ntion of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice\nwhere (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings ex parte,\n(2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to\ncriticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts\nfindings that contain internal evidence suggesting that\nthe judge may not have read them. Cf. id., at 568; Ga.\nCode of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibit\ning ex parte judicial communications).\n   We decline to determine in the first instance whether\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Instead, it sum\nmarily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals on an\naltogether different ground that was neither raised nor\npassed upon below and that is not fairly included within\nthe sole question presented. To make matters worse, the\nCourt conjures up an \u201cerror\u201d with respect to that ground\nby misquoting and mischaracterizing the Court of Appeals\u2019\nopinion, ante, at 9\u201310, and by overlooking relevant author\nity from this Court.

Jefferson\u2019s\nbriefs below contain no discussion or even citation of sub\nsection (d)\u2014let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)\u2014and the\ncourts below understandably never passed upon the appli\ncation of those provisions. Under our longstanding prac\ntice, that should be the end of the matter. See, e.g., Penn\nsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U. S. 206, 212\u2013\n213 (1998).\n   But the Court insists, ante, at 5\u20136, 8\u20139, that if we squint\nat them long enough we can see in Jefferson\u2019s briefs below\na challenge to the state court\u2019s fact-finding process cogni\nzable under \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), and (7). But the handful of\nisolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds\nof pages of briefs) show no such thing. The Court\u2019s only\nevidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District\nCourt, ante, at 5, 8, consists of a single sentence of text\n(and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the \u201cPrior\nProceedings\u201d section of his 180-page brief.

The sentence is: \u201cIn\nentering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton\nmerely signed an order drafted by the State without revi\nsion of a single word.\u201d Id., at 4. The footnote adds:\n       \u201c[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described wit\n    nesses who never testified, raising serious doubt as to\n    whether he even read, much less carefully considered,\n    the proposed order submitted by the State. In this\n    circumstance, there is no reason under principles of\n    comity or otherwise to give any deference to the find\n    ings of the State Habeas Court, because there was ap\n    parently no serious consideration or deliberation of\n    the factual and legal issues raised.\u201d Ibid., n. 1.\nThis passing suggestion that deference would be unwar\nranted is, to put it mildly, an elliptical way to argue that\nthe state fact-finding procedure was inadequate,\n\u00a72254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and\nadequate hearing, \u00a72254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was de\nnied due process of law, \u00a72254(d)(7). And it only appeared,\nI emphasize again, in the \u201cPrior Proceedings\u201d section of\nthe brief. The argument section of Jefferson\u2019s District\nCourt Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing sepa\nrate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no\nmention of the ground upon which the Court today relies.\nAnd the assignment of error that is the basis for the ques\ntion presented in Jefferson\u2019s petition, VI, id., at 47\u201380, did\nnot dispute the state courts\u2019 factual findings under\n\u00a72254(d), but only challenged the state courts\u2019 legal con\nclusion that his attorneys\u2019 failure to conduct a fuller inves\ntigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not\ndeficient performance under Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U. S. 668 (1984).\n   Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh\nCircuit. His brief to that court acknowledged that the\n4                   JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstate courts\u2019 \u201c[f]indings of fact and credibility determina\ntions are reviewed for clear error.\u201d Brief for Peti\ntioner/Appellee, No. 07\u201312502, pp. 16\u201317 (hereinafter\nAppeals Brief). It declared that \u201cThe District Court Cor\nrectly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court\u201d in\nadjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\nId., at 21 (capitalization and boldface type deleted); see\nalso id., at 29, and n. 7, 31. And it conceded that with\nrespect to the ineffective-assistance claim, \u201c[t]he relevant\nfacts are not in dispute.\u201d Id., at 24. Jefferson did charac\nterize the state habeas court\u2019s factual findings as gener\nally \u201cdubious\u201d and suggested there were \u201cserious doubts\u201d\nabout them, id., at 32, n. 10. But not once did he argue\nthat the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence\nof a failure to meet the requirements of \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or\n(7)\u2014or even more generally that the findings should not\nbe presumed correct under \u00a72254(d). Instead, he pressed\nthe same argument he made in the District Court: Even if\nthe state courts\u2019 factual findings were correct, his trial\nattorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to\nforgo further investigation of his childhood head injury.\nId., at 31\u201333, 50\u201351.\n   Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the\nCourt now addresses.

In doing so, the court\n\u201cspecifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district\ncourt questioned the state court\u2019s factual finding that [the\ndefense\u2019s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson\u2019s attor\nney\u2019s] to believe that further investigation would simply\nbe a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney\u2019s] testimony\nthat [the expert] told him it \u2018may\u2019 be a waste of time.\u201d Id.,\nat 1303, n. 8. It added that Jefferson did not \u201cpoint to any\nparticular finding that was clearly erroneous,\u201d id., at 1304,\nn. 8\u2014applying the same standard Jefferson had proposed\nin his brief, see supra, at 3. Even the dissent agreed that\n6                  JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthe court was \u201cobliged to accept\u201d the state courts\u2019 credibil\nity determination, despite the \u201creasons to doubt it.\u201d 570\nF. 3d, at 1312 (opinion of Carnes, J.). The dissent did not\ncite \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the\nsame question of constitutional law that occupied Jeffer\nson\u2019s briefs, the District Court\u2019s opinion, and the major\nity\u2019s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and\ncredibility determination of the state courts as true, Jef\nferson\u2019s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of coun\nsel. That is only the question that occupied the courts and\nthe parties below.\n                              B\n  It is bad enough that the Court decides an issue not\nraised or resolved in the lower courts. It is much worse\nthat it decides an issue Jefferson has not even asked us to\naddress. Under this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a), \u201c[o]nly the\nquestions set forth in the petition, or fairly included\ntherein, will be considered by the Court.\u201d We apply that\nrule in all but \u201cthe most exceptional cases, where reasons\nof urgency or of economy suggest the need to address the\nunpresented question under consideration.\u201d Yee v. Escon\ndido, 503 U. S. 519, 535 (1992) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Jefferson\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari presents a\nsingle question:\n      \u201c[W]hether the majority opinion, in affording trial\n    counsel\u2019s decision to limit the scope of investigation in\n    a death penalty case \u2018higher-than-strong presumption\n    of reasonableness\u2019 [sic] conflicts with this Court\u2019s\n    precedent as announced in Williams v.

Nor does that\nquestion necessarily encompass whether the Court of\nAppeals misapplied that version of \u00a72254(d) in determin\ning the deference due to the state courts\u2019 factual findings.\nThe statutory question may be \u201crelated to,\u201d and \u201cperhaps\ncomplementary to the one petitioner presented,\u201d but it is\nnot \u201cfairly included therein.\u201d Yee, supra, at 537 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   As for the body of Jefferson\u2019s petition: Far from invoking\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s exceptions to the presumption of correctness to\nsupport the Sixth Amendment claim, the petition does not\neven mention subsection (d), let alone paragraphs (2), (6),\nor (7). There is no argument, anywhere in the section\nentitled \u201cReasons for Granting the Writ,\u201d that the state\ncourts\u2019 factual findings are not entitled to a presumption\nof correctness.\n   The Court claims, ante, at 6, that Jefferson sufficiently\npresented the statutory issue by his characterizations of\nthe state courts\u2019 factual findings in the \u201cStatement of the\nCase\u201d section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 11\u201313, 17,\nn. 12, 18, n. 13. Even if that were so, \u201c \u2018the fact that [peti\ntioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for\ncertiorari does not bring it before us. Rule 14.1(a) requires\nthat a subsidiary question be fairly included in the ques\ntion presented for our review.\u2019 \u201d Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13) (quoting Izumi Seimitsu\nKogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S.\n27, 31, n. 5 (1993) (per curiam)). But in any event, the\ncited passages do not remotely present the statutory issue.\nThey contain no argument that \u00a72254(d)\u2019s presumption is\ninapplicable because of \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely\ndescribe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11\u201313,\nand assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state\n8                  JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncourt findings (but for the \u00a72254(d) presumption), see id.,\nat 17, n. 12, 18, n. 13.\n  \u201cThe premise of our adversarial system is that appellate\ncourts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry\nand research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions\npresented and argued by the parties before them.\u201d Car\nducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion\nof Scalia, J.). Our refusal to abide by standard rules of\nappellate practice is unfair to the Eleventh Circuit, whose\njudgment the Court vacates, and especially to the respon\ndent here, who suffers a loss in this Court without ever\nhaving an opportunity to address the merits of the statu\ntory question the Court decides.\n                             II\n   The Court\u2019s approach would be objectionable even if it\nwere correct that the Court of Appeals went astray. But\nit is not. The Court of Appeals did not treat \u00a72254(d)(8)\nas \u201cthe exclusive statutory exception\u201d to the presumption\nof correctness. Ante, at 10. It is true that the major\nity\u2019s opinion\u2014as well as the dissent\u2019s\u2014discussed only\n\u00a72254(d)(8). But that is because only \u00a72254(d)(8), and\nnot \u00a72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the\ncourt\u2019s attention. On the fair reading we owe the Elev\nenth Circuit\u2019s opinion, there simply was no error in its\napplication of \u00a72254(d).\n   The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit\nignored the other seven paragraphs in \u00a72254(d) when it\n\u201cinvoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8)\nof \u00a72254(d).\u201d Ante, at 9. It did nothing of the sort. The\nCourt of Appeals said that a state court\u2019s factual findings\n\u201cmay be disregarded if, for example, they are not \u2018fairly\nsupported by the record,\u2019 Jackson v. Herring, 42 F. 3d\n1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(8)).\u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1300 (emphasis added). The\nCourt of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a72254(d)(8) was but one example of the grounds for disre\ngarding a state court\u2019s factual findings. And the Circuit\nprecedent it cited, Jackson v. Herring, similarly did not\nimply, much less hold, that \u00a72254(d)(8) provided the only\ngrounds for setting aside a state court\u2019s factual findings\nunder \u00a72254(d). See 42 F. 3d, at 1366.\n  Next, the Court states:\n    \u201cAnd even though the Court of Appeals \u2018recognize[d]\u2019\n    that Jefferson had argued that the state court\u2019s proc\n    ess had produced factual findings that were \u2018 \u201cdubious\n    at best,\u201d \u2019 and that federal courts should therefore\n    \u2018 \u201charbor serious doubts about\u201d \u2019 the state court\u2019s\n    \u2018 \u201cfindings of fact and credibility,\u201d \u2019 the Court of Ap\n    peals nonetheless held that the state court\u2019s findings\n    are \u2018 \u201centitled to a presumption of correctness\u201d \u2019 that it\n    was \u2018 \u201cduty-bound\u201d \u2019 to apply. 570 F. 3d, at 1304, n. 8\n    (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n. 10).\u201d Ante, at 9.\nAgain, the Court has plucked isolated language from here\nand there in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion, to produce a\nreading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed\nwith, or at least did not contest, Jefferson\u2019s claim of \u201cseri\nous doubts.\u201d That is not so. In the first paragraph of\nfootnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was\n\u201cduty-bound to accept\u201d the state courts\u2019 factual findings\nbecause it concluded they \u201care clear, unambiguous, and\nfairly supported by the record.\u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1303\u20131304,\nn. 8. That language precedes the panel\u2019s analysis\u2014in the\nsecond paragraph of footnote eight\u2014regarding Jefferson\u2019s\nstatements that the findings were \u201cdubious\u201d and raised\n\u201cserious doubts.\u201d The Court omits the panel\u2019s actual\nexplanation for declining to credit Jefferson\u2019s general\ncharacterization of the quality of the record, which is:\n\u201cJefferson does not point to any particular factual finding\nthat was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the\nargument section of his brief that, \u2018[t]he relevant facts are\n10                       JEFFERSON v. UPTON\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnot in dispute.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1304, n. 8.\n  By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly\ndescribed application of the pre-AEDPA version of\n\u00a72254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that\nwould have been no worse than what we have done. For\nexample, in Demosthenes v. Baal, 495 U. S. 731, 735\n(1990) (per curiam), we stated that a federal court may not\noverturn a state habeas court\u2019s factual determinations\n\u201cunless it concludes that they are not \u2018fairly supported by\nthe record.\u2019 See 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(8).\u201d And in Parker v.\nDugger, 498 U. S. 308, 320 (1991), we explained that a\nfederal habeas court \u201cis not to overturn a factual conclu\nsion of a state court, including a state appellate court,\nunless the conclusion is not \u2018fairly supported by the\nrecord.\u2019 \u201d2\n                       *   *    *\n   Generally speaking, we have no power to set aside the\nduly entered judgment of a lower federal court unless we\nfind it to have been in error. More specifically, except\nwhere there has been an intervening legal development\n(such as a subsequently announced opinion of ours) that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The  Court attempts to distinguish these two cases on the ground\nthat they contained \u201cno suggestion that any other provisions enumer\nated in \u00a72254(d) were at issue,\u201d whereas \u201c[t]hat is not the case here.\u201d\nAnte, at 10. That is simply not so. As already noted, there was no\n\u201csuggestion\u201d here (let alone an actual argument) that paragraphs (2),\n(6), or (7) were in issue. And if the Court means no more than that\npetitioner here made some process-type noises, the same was true\u2014and\nindeed more true\u2014of Parker and Demosthenes. In Parker, we stated\nthe \u201ccrux of [petitioner\u2019s] contentions\u201d was that the state courts \u201cfail[ed]\nto treat adequately\u201d the evidence he presented. 498 U. S., at 313. In\nDemosthenes, the Ninth Circuit had said that the state court\u2019s process\nfor determining whether the capital inmate was competent was defi\ncient because \u201c \u2018a full evidentiary hearing on competence should have\nbeen held.\u2019 \u201d 495 U. S., at 736 (quoting Order in Baal v. Godinez, No.\n90\u201315716 (CA9, June 2, 1990), p. 5).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmight alter the judgment below, we cannot grant a peti\ntion for certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand\nthe case (GVR) simply to obtain a re-do. Webster v.\nCooper, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (SCALIA, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 3). Yet today the Court vacates the judgment\nof the Eleventh Circuit on the basis of an error that court\ndid not commit, with respect to a statutory issue that had\nnever previously been raised, and remands for more ex\ntensive consideration of a new argument that might affect\nthe judgment.
