When we granted\ncertiorari, we rephrased the question presented to focus on\nthat issue: \u201cWhether an action for criminal contempt in a\ncongressionally created court may constitutionally be\nbrought in the name and pursuant to the power of a pri\nvate person, rather than in the name and pursuant to the\npower of the United States.\u201d 558 U. S ___ (2009). The\nanswer to that question is no. The terrifying force of the\ncriminal justice system may only be brought to bear\nagainst an individual by society as a whole, through a\nprosecution brought on behalf of the government. The\ncourt below held otherwise, relying on a dissenting opinion\nin one of our cases, and on the litigating position of the\nUnited States, which the Solicitor General has properly\nabandoned in this Court. See Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 12\u201313, n. 3. We should correct the lower\ncourt\u2019s error and return the case to that court to resolve\n2      ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe remaining questions.\n                              I\n  In March 1999, Wykenna Watson was assaulted by her\nthen-boyfriend, John Robertson. App. 40. Watson sought\nand secured a civil protective order against Robertson,\nprohibiting him from approaching within 100 feet of her\nand from assaulting, threatening, harassing, physically\nabusing, or contacting her. Id., at 20. At the same time,\nthe United States Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) was independ\nently pursuing criminal charges against Robertson arising\nfrom the assault.\n  On June 26, Robertson violated the protective order by\nagain violently assaulting Watson. On July 8, he was\nindicted for the previous March incident; shortly thereaf\nter, the USAO offered, and Robertson accepted, a plea\nagreement resolving those charges. Id., at 26\u201330. At the\ntop of the boilerplate plea form, the Assistant U. S. Attor\nney added in longhand: \u201cIn exchange for Mr. Robertson\u2019s\nplea of guilty to attempt[ed] aggravated assault, the gov\u2019t\nagrees to: DISMISS the [remaining] charges[,] [and] [n]ot\npursue any charges concerning an incident on 6-26-99.\u201d\nId., at 28. The Superior Court accepted Robertson\u2019s plea\nand sentenced him to 1 to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment. Id., at\n30, 46, 53.\n  A few months later, Watson filed a motion to initiate\ncriminal contempt proceedings against Robertson for\nviolating the civil protective order, based on the June 26\nassault. See D. C. Code \u00a716\u20131005(f) (2009 Supp.); D. C.\nSuper. Ct. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (Lexis 2010); In re\nRobertson, 940 A. 2d 1050, 1053 (D. C. 2008). After a 2\nday bench trial, the court found Robertson guilty on three\ncounts of criminal contempt and sentenced him to three\nconsecutive 180-day terms of imprisonment, suspending\nexecution of the last in favor of five years\u2019 probation. The\ncourt also ordered Robertson to pay Watson roughly\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n$10,000 in restitution. App. 2, 63\u201364. Robertson filed a\nmotion to vacate the judgment, which the court denied.\n   Robertson appealed. Criminal contempt prosecutions,\nhe argued, \u201care between the public and the defendant,\u201d\nand thus could \u201conly be brought in the name of the rele\nvant sovereign, . . . the United States.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n8, 10 (quoting Brief for Appellant in No. 00\u2013FM\u20131269 etc.\n(D. C.), pp. 20\u201321, and 940 A. 2d, at 1057; internal quota\ntion marks omitted). So viewed, the prosecution based on\nthe June 26 incident could not be brought, because the\nplea agreement barred the \u201cgov[ernmen]t\u201d from pursuing\nany charges arising from that incident.\n   The Court of Appeals rejected Robertson\u2019s arguments, in\na two-step holding. Step one: \u201cthe criminal contempt\nprosecution in this case was conducted as a private action\nbrought in the name and interest of Ms. Watson, not as a\npublic action brought in the name and interest of the\nUnited States or any other governmental entity.\u201d 940\nA. 2d, at 1057\u20131058 (internal quotation marks and brack\nets omitted). Step two: because the criminal contempt\nprosecution was brought as an exercise of private power,\nthat prosecution did not implicate a plea agreement that\nbound only the government. Id., at 1059\u20131060.\n   We granted certiorari to review the first step of that\nholding.\n                            II \n\n                            A\n\n  Our decision in United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688\n(1993), provides the answer to the question presented\nhere. The question in Dixon was one of double jeopardy\u2014\nwhether a private party\u2019s prosecution for criminal con\ntempt barred the Government\u2019s subsequent prosecution\nfor the \u201csame criminal offense.\u201d Id., at 696. The private\nprosecution in that case was brought under the same D. C.\ncontempt law at issue here. Id., at 692 (citing D. C. Code\n4      ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\u00a716\u20131005 (1989)).\n   We thought it \u201cobvious\u201d in Dixon that double jeopardy\nprotections barred the Government\u2019s subsequent prosecu\ntion. 509 U. S., at 696. The Double Jeopardy Clause, of\ncourse, bars the second prosecution for the same offense\nonly if that prosecution is brought by the same sovereign\nas the first. See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88\u201389\n(1985). Thus, the only possible way the Government\u2019s\nsecond prosecution could have offended the Double Jeop\nardy Clause is if the Court understood the criminal con\ntempt prosecution to be the Government\u2019s first prosecu\ntion\u2014i.e., one brought on behalf of the Government. See\nUnited States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 451 (1989) (\u201cThe\nprotections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not trig\ngered by litigation between private parties\u201d), overruled on\nother grounds by Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93\n(1997).\n   That we treated the criminal contempt prosecution in\nDixon as an exercise of government power should not be\nsurprising. More than two centuries ago, Blackstone\nwrote that the king is \u201cthe proper person to prosecute for\nall public offenses and breaches of the peace, being the\nperson injured in the eye of the law.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries *268. Blackstone repeated that principle\nthroughout his fourth book. See, e.g., 4 id., at *2, *8, *177.\nNot long after Blackstone, then-Representative John\nMarshall agreed, stating on the House floor that \u201cadminis\nter[ing] criminal judgment . . . is a duty to be performed at\nthe demand of the nation, and with which the nation has a\nright to dispense. If judgment . . . is to be pronounced, it\nmust be at the prosecution of the nation.\u201d 10 Annals of\nCong. 615 (1800).\n   This principle has deep historical roots. See, e.g., 1 F.\nWharton, Criminal Law \u00a710, p. 11 (9th ed. 1885) (\u201cPenal\njustice . . . is a distinctive prerogative of the State, to be\nexercised in the service [of] the State\u201d); see also J. Locke,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nSecond Treatise of Civil Government \u00a788, pp. 43\u201344 (J.\nGough ed. 1947) (\u201c[E]very man who has entered into civil\nsociety, and is become a member of any commonwealth,\nhas thereby quitted his power to punish offences against\nthe law of nature in prosecution of his own private judg\nment[.] . . . [H]e has given a right to the commonwealth to\nemploy his force for the execution of the judgments of the\ncommonwealth\u201d (footnote omitted)). As this Court has\nsaid before, \u201c[c]rimes and offenses against the laws of any\nState can only be defined, prosecuted and pardoned by the\nsovereign authority of that State.\u201d Huntington v. Attrill,\n146 U. S. 657, 669 (1892); see also Heath, supra, at 88\n(\u201cThe dual sovereignty doctrine [of the Double Jeopardy\nClause] is founded on the common-law conception of crime\nas an offense against the sovereignty of the government\u201d).\n   These core principles are embodied in the Constitution.\nThe protections our Bill of Rights affords those facing\ncriminal prosecution apply to \u201cany person,\u201d \u201cany criminal\ncase,\u201d and \u201call criminal prosecutions.\u201d Amdts. 5, 6 (em\nphasis added). But those protections apply only against\nthe government; \u201c[i]ndividual invasion of individual rights\u201d\nis not covered. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 11 (1883)\n(Fourteenth Amendment). If the safeguards of the Bill of\nRights are to be available in \u201call criminal prosecutions,\u201d\nthen any such prosecution must be considered to be one on\nbehalf of the government\u2014otherwise the constitutional\nlimits do not apply. \u201cThe Constitution constrains govern\nmental action \u2018by whatever instruments or in whatever\nmodes that action may be taken,\u2019 \u201d Lebron v. National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 392 (1995)\n(quoting Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346\u2013347 (1880)),\nbut the action still must be governmental action.\n   The court below, however, rejected this understanding,\nconcluding that Watson\u2019s \u201ccriminal contempt prosecution\u201d\nwas not \u201ca public action\u201d but \u201ca private action,\u201d such that\nit was not covered by an agreement binding the govern\n6        ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nment. 940 A. 2d, at 1057\u20131058 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But as we have explained, \u201c[t]he purpose of a\ncriminal court is not to provide a forum for the ascertain\nment of private rights. Rather it is to vindicate the public\ninterest in the enforcement of the criminal law while at\nthe same time safeguarding the rights of the individual\ndefendant.\u201d Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 25\n(1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The holding below gives rise to a broad array of unset\ntling questions. Take the Due Process Clause. It guaran\ntees particular rights in criminal prosecutions because the\nprosecutor is a state actor, carrying out a \u201cduty on the part\nof the Government.\u201d Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 433\n(1995) (emphasis added). But if the criminal prosecution\nis instead viewed as \u201ca private action,\u201d not an exercise of\nsovereign power, how would those rights attach? Cf.\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489\nU. S. 189, 195\u2013196 (1989). What about Brady v. Mary\nland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)? The private prosecutor is likely\nto have evidence pertinent to the proceeding\u2014particularly\nif, as here, the private prosecutor is also the victim of the\ncrime. But if the prosecutor is not exercising governmen\ntal authority, what would be the constitutional basis for\nany Brady obligations? May the private prosecutor inter\nview the defendant without Miranda warnings, since she\nis not acting on behalf of any sovereign but only in a pri\nvate capacity? See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436\n(1966).\n   Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the\nnotion that a criminal prosecution pits the government\nagainst the governed, not one private citizen against\nanother. The ruling below is a startling repudiation of\nthat basic understanding.\n                              B\n    Despite the foregoing, the Court of Appeals determined\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthat Watson brought this criminal prosecution under her\nauthority as a private citizen. 940 A. 2d, at 1058. To\nreach that conclusion, the court relied on Justice Black\nmun\u2019s separate opinion in Dixon. See 940 A. 2d, at 1057\n(\u201cAs Justice Blackmun said in United States v. Dixon,\ncriminal contempt is \u2018a special situation.\u2019 [Dixon, 509\nU. S., at 742 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part)]. . . . \u2018[T]he purpose of contempt is not\nto punish an offense against the community at large but\nrather to punish the specific offense of disobeying a court\norder.\u2019 [Ibid.]\u201d (citation omitted)). In fact, the court\nquoted from Justice Blackmun\u2019s separate opinion no fewer\nthan four times. Id., at 1057.\n  Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion, however, was a partial\nconcurrence in the judgment and partial dissent, and it\ngarnered only one vote. Moreover, the portion of the\nopinion relied upon by the court below was the dissenting\npart. A majority of the Court squarely rejected Justice\nBlackmun\u2019s view, and did so in plain terms. See Dixon,\n509 U. S., at 699\u2013701 (opinion of SCALIA, J., joined by\nKENNEDY, J.); see id., at 720 (White, J., joined by STEVENS\nand Souter, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dis\nsenting in part).\n  Before this Court, Watson understandably retreats from\nJustice Blackmun\u2019s dissenting opinion. Instead, she ar\ngues that \u201c[i]n England and in America at the time of the\nFounding, prosecutions by victims of crime and their\nfamilies were the rule, not the exception.\u201d Brief for Re\nspondent 38\u201339. But such prosecutions, though brought\nby a private party, were commonly understood as an\nexercise of sovereign power\u2014the private party acting on\nbehalf of the sovereign, seeking to vindicate a public\nwrong.\n  In England, for example, private parties could initiate\ncriminal prosecutions, but the Crown\u2014entrusted with the\nconstitutional responsibility for law enforcement\u2014could\n8      ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nenter a nolle prosequi to halt the prosecution. See, e.g.,\nKing v. Guerchy, 1 Black W. 545, 96 Eng. Rep. 315 (K. B.\n1765); King v. Fielding, 2 Burr. 719, 720, 97 Eng. Rep. 531\n(K. B. 1759); see also King v. State, 43 Fla. 211, 223, 31 So.\n254, 257 (1901) (Private prosecutions in England were\nunderstood to be \u201cconducted on behalf of the crown by the\nprivately retained counsel of private prosecutors\u201d); P. Dev\nlin, The Criminal Prosecution in England 21 (1958).\n   Watson\u2019s arguments based on American precedent fail\nlargely for the same reason: To say that private parties\ncould (and still can, in some places) exercise some control\nover criminal prosecutions says nothing to rebut the\nwidely accepted principle that those private parties neces\nsarily acted (and now act) on behalf of the sovereign. See,\ne.g., Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A. 2d 866, 877\n(R. I. 2001) (\u201c[A]ttorneys conducting private prosecutions\nstand in the shoes of the state\u201d); State v. Westbrook, 279\nN. C. 18, 36, 181 S. E. 2d 572, 583 (1971) (\u201cThe prosecut\ning attorney, whether the solicitor or privately employed\ncounsel, represents the State\u201d); Sidman, The Outmoded\nConcept of Private Prosecution, 25 Am. U. L. Rev. 754, 774\n(1976) (\u201c[T]he privately retained attorney becomes, in\neffect, a temporary public prosecutor\u201d). Indeed, many of\nthe state court authorities Watson herself cites expressly\nrecognize this fundamental point. See, e.g., Katz v. Com\nmonwealth, 379 Mass. 305, 312, 399 N. E. 2d 1055, 1060\n(1979) (\u201c[I]t is clear with respect to the criminal aspects of\nthe present case that the Commonwealth . . . is the ad\nverse party\u201d).\n   We have no need to take issue with that proposition, but\nthis case is different. The whole point of the ruling below\nwas that this was not a \u201cpublic action\u201d that happened to\nbe litigated by a private party, but \u201ca private action\nbrought in the name and interest of [Ms.] Watson.\u201d 940\nA. 2d, at 1057\u20131058. That holding was critical in explain\ning why Watson\u2019s criminal action was not barred by a plea\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nagreement that bound the government.\n   Moving beyond criminal prosecutions generally, Watson\nnext contends that contempt prosecutions are unique, and\nthus should be exempt from the general rule. See Brief for\nRespondent 24. If Watson means to argue that modern\ncriminal contempts are not \u201ccrimes,\u201d that view was\nsquarely rejected by this Court in Bloom v. Illinois, 391\nU. S. 194 (1968). See id., at 199\u2013200 (holding that a\ncriminal contempt prosecution is a criminal prosecution\nfor the purposes of the Sixth Amendment); see also id., at\n201 (\u201cCriminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense\u201d);\nUnited States v. Providence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693,\n700 (1988) (\u201cThe fact that the allegedly criminal conduct\nconcerns the violation of a court order instead of common\nlaw or a statutory prohibition does not render the prosecu\ntion any less an exercise of the sovereign power of the\nUnited States\u201d).\n   In any event, even if contempt prosecutions might not\nalways count as \u201ccrimes,\u201d this one undoubtedly does, as\nWatson herself concedes. Brief for Respondent 34 (\u201c[T]his\ncase was clearly a criminal contempt proceeding from\nbeginning to end\u201d). That concession is well taken, given\nthat whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil\nis \u201ca matter of statutory construction,\u201d Hudson, 522 U. S.,\nat 99, and that the relevant provisions here make clear\nthat contempt proceedings like this one are criminal, see\nD. C. Code \u00a716\u20131005(f) (\u201c[C]riminal contempt shall be\npunished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment\nfor not more than 180 days, or both\u201d); see also D. C. Super.\nCt. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (labeled \u201cMotion to adju\ndicate criminal contempt,\u201d and describing the violation as\n\u201ccriminal contempt\u201d). As Justice Holmes put it for the\nCourt: \u201cThese contempts are infractions of the law, visited\nwith punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal,\nwe are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic\nof crimes as that word has been understood in English\n10     ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nspeech.\u201d Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604, 610\n(1914).\n  The United States bears some responsibility for leading\nthe court below astray. In that court, the Government\nargued that the criminal contempt prosecution was \u201c \u2018a\nprivate action brought in the name and interest of [Ms.]\nWatson, not . . . a public action brought in the name and\ninterest of the United States or any other governmental\nentity.\u2019 \u201d 940 A. 2d, at 1056 (quoting Brief for United\nStates in No. 00\u2013FM\u2013925 etc. (D. C.)). The court below\nquoted that precise language in stating its conclusion. See\n940 A. 2d, at 1057\u20131058 (same).\n  Before this Court, the Solicitor General has properly\nabandoned that position, and does not defend the lower\ncourt\u2019s decision on this issue. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12\u201313, n. 3 (\u201c[T]he United States no\nlonger believes the contempt prosecution at issue can be\nunderstood as a purely \u2018private action\u2019 \u201d). We should do\nour part and correct the ruling of the court below.\n                             III\n   The ultimate issue in this case, of course, is whether the\ncriminal contempt prosecution Watson initiated in Janu\nary 2000 violated the plea agreement Robertson signed\nwith the USAO in July 1999. The Court of Appeals said\n\u201cno,\u201d based solely on its determination that Watson was\nexercising private\u2014not sovereign\u2014power.            With that\ndetermination in hand, the ultimate plea agreement ques\ntion was straightforward: If Watson was wielding purely\nprivate power, a plea agreement that by its terms bound\nonly the \u201cgov[ernmen]t\u201d would not bind her.\n   With a proper view of Watson\u2019s role in this case, how\never, the plea agreement question becomes significantly\nmore difficult. The Solicitor General argues that the\nagreement does not bar the contempt prosecution, even if\nthat prosecution is correctly viewed as on behalf of the\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The difficult aspects of that legal\nissue, however, should not cause us to shy away from\nanswering the fundamental threshold question whether a\ncriminal prosecution may be brought on behalf and in the\ninterest of a private party. Having decided that threshold\nquestion in favor of Robertson, I would remand to the\ncourt below to consider the plea agreement from the\nproper starting point.\n  In light of all the foregoing, it is worth stressing that the\nmajority\u2019s determination not to decide that question \u201ccar\nries with it no implication whatever regarding the Court\u2019s\nviews on the merits.\u201d Maryland v.

When we granted\ncertiorari, we rephrased the question presented to focus on\nthat issue: \u201cWhether an action for criminal contempt in a\ncongressionally created court may constitutionally be\nbrought in the name and pursuant to the power of a pri\nvate person, rather than in the name and pursuant to the\npower of the United States.\u201d 558 U. S ___ (2009). The\nanswer to that question is no. The terrifying force of the\ncriminal justice system may only be brought to bear\nagainst an individual by society as a whole, through a\nprosecution brought on behalf of the government. The\ncourt below held otherwise, relying on a dissenting opinion\nin one of our cases, and on the litigating position of the\nUnited States, which the Solicitor General has properly\nabandoned in this Court. See Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 12\u201313, n. 3. We should correct the lower\ncourt\u2019s error and return the case to that court to resolve\n2      ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe remaining questions.\n                              I\n  In March 1999, Wykenna Watson was assaulted by her\nthen-boyfriend, John Robertson. App. 40. Watson sought\nand secured a civil protective order against Robertson,\nprohibiting him from approaching within 100 feet of her\nand from assaulting, threatening, harassing, physically\nabusing, or contacting her. Id., at 20. At the same time,\nthe United States Attorney\u2019s Office (USAO) was independ\nently pursuing criminal charges against Robertson arising\nfrom the assault.\n  On June 26, Robertson violated the protective order by\nagain violently assaulting Watson. On July 8, he was\nindicted for the previous March incident; shortly thereaf\nter, the USAO offered, and Robertson accepted, a plea\nagreement resolving those charges. Id., at 26\u201330. At the\ntop of the boilerplate plea form, the Assistant U. S. Attor\nney added in longhand: \u201cIn exchange for Mr. Robertson\u2019s\nplea of guilty to attempt[ed] aggravated assault, the gov\u2019t\nagrees to: DISMISS the [remaining] charges[,] [and] [n]ot\npursue any charges concerning an incident on 6-26-99.\u201d\nId., at 28. The Superior Court accepted Robertson\u2019s plea\nand sentenced him to 1 to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment. Id., at\n30, 46, 53.\n  A few months later, Watson filed a motion to initiate\ncriminal contempt proceedings against Robertson for\nviolating the civil protective order, based on the June 26\nassault. See D. C. Code \u00a716\u20131005(f) (2009 Supp.); D. C.\nSuper. Ct. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (Lexis 2010); In re\nRobertson, 940 A. 2d 1050, 1053 (D. C. 2008). After a 2\nday bench trial, the court found Robertson guilty on three\ncounts of criminal contempt and sentenced him to three\nconsecutive 180-day terms of imprisonment, suspending\nexecution of the last in favor of five years\u2019 probation. The\ncourt also ordered Robertson to pay Watson roughly\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n$10,000 in restitution. App. 2, 63\u201364. Robertson filed a\nmotion to vacate the judgment, which the court denied.\n   Robertson appealed. Criminal contempt prosecutions,\nhe argued, \u201care between the public and the defendant,\u201d\nand thus could \u201conly be brought in the name of the rele\nvant sovereign, . . . the United States.\u201d Brief for Petitioner\n8, 10 (quoting Brief for Appellant in No. 00\u2013FM\u20131269 etc.\n(D. C.), pp. 20\u201321, and 940 A. 2d, at 1057; internal quota\ntion marks omitted). So viewed, the prosecution based on\nthe June 26 incident could not be brought, because the\nplea agreement barred the \u201cgov[ernmen]t\u201d from pursuing\nany charges arising from that incident.\n   The Court of Appeals rejected Robertson\u2019s arguments, in\na two-step holding. Step one: \u201cthe criminal contempt\nprosecution in this case was conducted as a private action\nbrought in the name and interest of Ms. Watson, not as a\npublic action brought in the name and interest of the\nUnited States or any other governmental entity.\u201d 940\nA. 2d, at 1057\u20131058 (internal quotation marks and brack\nets omitted). Step two: because the criminal contempt\nprosecution was brought as an exercise of private power,\nthat prosecution did not implicate a plea agreement that\nbound only the government. Id., at 1059\u20131060.\n   We granted certiorari to review the first step of that\nholding.\n                            II \n\n                            A\n\n  Our decision in United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688\n(1993), provides the answer to the question presented\nhere. The question in Dixon was one of double jeopardy\u2014\nwhether a private party\u2019s prosecution for criminal con\ntempt barred the Government\u2019s subsequent prosecution\nfor the \u201csame criminal offense.\u201d Id., at 696. The private\nprosecution in that case was brought under the same D. C.\ncontempt law at issue here. Id., at 692 (citing D. C. Code\n4      ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\u00a716\u20131005 (1989)).\n   We thought it \u201cobvious\u201d in Dixon that double jeopardy\nprotections barred the Government\u2019s subsequent prosecu\ntion. 509 U. S., at 696. The Double Jeopardy Clause, of\ncourse, bars the second prosecution for the same offense\nonly if that prosecution is brought by the same sovereign\nas the first. See Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82, 88\u201389\n(1985). Thus, the only possible way the Government\u2019s\nsecond prosecution could have offended the Double Jeop\nardy Clause is if the Court understood the criminal con\ntempt prosecution to be the Government\u2019s first prosecu\ntion\u2014i.e., one brought on behalf of the Government. See\nUnited States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 451 (1989) (\u201cThe\nprotections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not trig\ngered by litigation between private parties\u201d), overruled on\nother grounds by Hudson v. United States, 522 U. S. 93\n(1997).\n   That we treated the criminal contempt prosecution in\nDixon as an exercise of government power should not be\nsurprising. More than two centuries ago, Blackstone\nwrote that the king is \u201cthe proper person to prosecute for\nall public offenses and breaches of the peace, being the\nperson injured in the eye of the law.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries *268. Blackstone repeated that principle\nthroughout his fourth book. See, e.g., 4 id., at *2, *8, *177.\nNot long after Blackstone, then-Representative John\nMarshall agreed, stating on the House floor that \u201cadminis\nter[ing] criminal judgment . . . is a duty to be performed at\nthe demand of the nation, and with which the nation has a\nright to dispense. If judgment . . . is to be pronounced, it\nmust be at the prosecution of the nation.\u201d 10 Annals of\nCong. 615 (1800).\n   This principle has deep historical roots. See, e.g., 1 F.\nWharton, Criminal Law \u00a710, p. 11 (9th ed. 1885) (\u201cPenal\njustice . . . is a distinctive prerogative of the State, to be\nexercised in the service [of] the State\u201d); see also J. Locke,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

[H]e has given a right to the commonwealth to\nemploy his force for the execution of the judgments of the\ncommonwealth\u201d (footnote omitted)). As this Court has\nsaid before, \u201c[c]rimes and offenses against the laws of any\nState can only be defined, prosecuted and pardoned by the\nsovereign authority of that State.\u201d Huntington v. Attrill,\n146 U. S. 657, 669 (1892); see also Heath, supra, at 88\n(\u201cThe dual sovereignty doctrine [of the Double Jeopardy\nClause] is founded on the common-law conception of crime\nas an offense against the sovereignty of the government\u201d).\n   These core principles are embodied in the Constitution.\nThe protections our Bill of Rights affords those facing\ncriminal prosecution apply to \u201cany person,\u201d \u201cany criminal\ncase,\u201d and \u201call criminal prosecutions.\u201d Amdts. 5, 6 (em\nphasis added). But those protections apply only against\nthe government; \u201c[i]ndividual invasion of individual rights\u201d\nis not covered. Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 11 (1883)\n(Fourteenth Amendment). If the safeguards of the Bill of\nRights are to be available in \u201call criminal prosecutions,\u201d\nthen any such prosecution must be considered to be one on\nbehalf of the government\u2014otherwise the constitutional\nlimits do not apply. \u201cThe Constitution constrains govern\nmental action \u2018by whatever instruments or in whatever\nmodes that action may be taken,\u2019 \u201d Lebron v.

S. 339, 346\u2013347 (1880)),\nbut the action still must be governmental action.\n   The court below, however, rejected this understanding,\nconcluding that Watson\u2019s \u201ccriminal contempt prosecution\u201d\nwas not \u201ca public action\u201d but \u201ca private action,\u201d such that\nit was not covered by an agreement binding the govern\n6        ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nment. 940 A. 2d, at 1057\u20131058 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But as we have explained, \u201c[t]he purpose of a\ncriminal court is not to provide a forum for the ascertain\nment of private rights. Rather it is to vindicate the public\ninterest in the enforcement of the criminal law while at\nthe same time safeguarding the rights of the individual\ndefendant.\u201d Standefer v. United States, 447 U. S. 10, 25\n(1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The holding below gives rise to a broad array of unset\ntling questions. Take the Due Process Clause. It guaran\ntees particular rights in criminal prosecutions because the\nprosecutor is a state actor, carrying out a \u201cduty on the part\nof the Government.\u201d Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 433\n(1995) (emphasis added). But if the criminal prosecution\nis instead viewed as \u201ca private action,\u201d not an exercise of\nsovereign power, how would those rights attach? Cf.\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489\nU. S. 189, 195\u2013196 (1989). What about Brady v. Mary\nland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)? The private prosecutor is likely\nto have evidence pertinent to the proceeding\u2014particularly\nif, as here, the private prosecutor is also the victim of the\ncrime. But if the prosecutor is not exercising governmen\ntal authority, what would be the constitutional basis for\nany Brady obligations? May the private prosecutor inter\nview the defendant without Miranda warnings, since she\nis not acting on behalf of any sovereign but only in a pri\nvate capacity? See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436\n(1966).\n   Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the\nnotion that a criminal prosecution pits the government\nagainst the governed, not one private citizen against\nanother. The ruling below is a startling repudiation of\nthat basic understanding.\n                              B\n    Despite the foregoing, the Court of Appeals determined\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthat Watson brought this criminal prosecution under her\nauthority as a private citizen. 940 A. 2d, at 1058. To\nreach that conclusion, the court relied on Justice Black\nmun\u2019s separate opinion in Dixon. See 940 A. 2d, at 1057\n(\u201cAs Justice Blackmun said in United States v. Dixon,\ncriminal contempt is \u2018a special situation.\u2019 [Dixon, 509\nU. S., at 742 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part)]. . . . \u2018[T]he purpose of contempt is not\nto punish an offense against the community at large but\nrather to punish the specific offense of disobeying a court\norder.\u2019 [Ibid.]\u201d (citation omitted)). In fact, the court\nquoted from Justice Blackmun\u2019s separate opinion no fewer\nthan four times. Id., at 1057.\n  Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion, however, was a partial\nconcurrence in the judgment and partial dissent, and it\ngarnered only one vote. Moreover, the portion of the\nopinion relied upon by the court below was the dissenting\npart. A majority of the Court squarely rejected Justice\nBlackmun\u2019s view, and did so in plain terms. See Dixon,\n509 U. S., at 699\u2013701 (opinion of SCALIA, J., joined by\nKENNEDY, J.); see id., at 720 (White, J., joined by STEVENS\nand Souter, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dis\nsenting in part).\n  Before this Court, Watson understandably retreats from\nJustice Blackmun\u2019s dissenting opinion. Instead, she ar\ngues that \u201c[i]n England and in America at the time of the\nFounding, prosecutions by victims of crime and their\nfamilies were the rule, not the exception.\u201d Brief for Re\nspondent 38\u201339. But such prosecutions, though brought\nby a private party, were commonly understood as an\nexercise of sovereign power\u2014the private party acting on\nbehalf of the sovereign, seeking to vindicate a public\nwrong.\n  In England, for example, private parties could initiate\ncriminal prosecutions, but the Crown\u2014entrusted with the\nconstitutional responsibility for law enforcement\u2014could\n8      ROBERTSON v.

Indeed, many of\nthe state court authorities Watson herself cites expressly\nrecognize this fundamental point. See, e.g., Katz v.

E. 2d 1055, 1060\n(1979) (\u201c[I]t is clear with respect to the criminal aspects of\nthe present case that the Commonwealth . . . is the ad\nverse party\u201d).\n   We have no need to take issue with that proposition, but\nthis case is different. The whole point of the ruling below\nwas that this was not a \u201cpublic action\u201d that happened to\nbe litigated by a private party, but \u201ca private action\nbrought in the name and interest of [Ms.] Watson.\u201d 940\nA. 2d, at 1057\u20131058. That holding was critical in explain\ning why Watson\u2019s criminal action was not barred by a plea\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nagreement that bound the government.\n   Moving beyond criminal prosecutions generally, Watson\nnext contends that contempt prosecutions are unique, and\nthus should be exempt from the general rule. See Brief for\nRespondent 24. If Watson means to argue that modern\ncriminal contempts are not \u201ccrimes,\u201d that view was\nsquarely rejected by this Court in Bloom v. Illinois, 391\nU. S. 194 (1968). See id., at 199\u2013200 (holding that a\ncriminal contempt prosecution is a criminal prosecution\nfor the purposes of the Sixth Amendment); see also id., at\n201 (\u201cCriminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense\u201d);\nUnited States v. Providence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693,\n700 (1988) (\u201cThe fact that the allegedly criminal conduct\nconcerns the violation of a court order instead of common\nlaw or a statutory prohibition does not render the prosecu\ntion any less an exercise of the sovereign power of the\nUnited States\u201d).\n   In any event, even if contempt prosecutions might not\nalways count as \u201ccrimes,\u201d this one undoubtedly does, as\nWatson herself concedes. Brief for Respondent 34 (\u201c[T]his\ncase was clearly a criminal contempt proceeding from\nbeginning to end\u201d). That concession is well taken, given\nthat whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil\nis \u201ca matter of statutory construction,\u201d Hudson, 522 U. S.,\nat 99, and that the relevant provisions here make clear\nthat contempt proceedings like this one are criminal, see\nD. C. Code \u00a716\u20131005(f) (\u201c[C]riminal contempt shall be\npunished by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment\nfor not more than 180 days, or both\u201d); see also D. C. Super.\nCt. Domestic Violence Rule 12(d) (labeled \u201cMotion to adju\ndicate criminal contempt,\u201d and describing the violation as\n\u201ccriminal contempt\u201d). As Justice Holmes put it for the\nCourt: \u201cThese contempts are infractions of the law, visited\nwith punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal,\nwe are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic\nof crimes as that word has been understood in English\n10     ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nspeech.\u201d Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604, 610\n(1914).\n  The United States bears some responsibility for leading\nthe court below astray. In that court, the Government\nargued that the criminal contempt prosecution was \u201c \u2018a\nprivate action brought in the name and interest of [Ms.]\nWatson, not . . . a public action brought in the name and\ninterest of the United States or any other governmental\nentity.\u2019 \u201d 940 A. 2d, at 1056 (quoting Brief for United\nStates in No. 00\u2013FM\u2013925 etc. (D. C.)). The court below\nquoted that precise language in stating its conclusion. See\n940 A. 2d, at 1057\u20131058 (same).\n  Before this Court, the Solicitor General has properly\nabandoned that position, and does not defend the lower\ncourt\u2019s decision on this issue. See Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12\u201313, n. 3 (\u201c[T]he United States no\nlonger believes the contempt prosecution at issue can be\nunderstood as a purely \u2018private action\u2019 \u201d). We should do\nour part and correct the ruling of the court below.\n                             III\n   The ultimate issue in this case, of course, is whether the\ncriminal contempt prosecution Watson initiated in Janu\nary 2000 violated the plea agreement Robertson signed\nwith the USAO in July 1999. The Court of Appeals said\n\u201cno,\u201d based solely on its determination that Watson was\nexercising private\u2014not sovereign\u2014power.            With that\ndetermination in hand, the ultimate plea agreement ques\ntion was straightforward: If Watson was wielding purely\nprivate power, a plea agreement that by its terms bound\nonly the \u201cgov[ernmen]t\u201d would not bind her.\n   With a proper view of Watson\u2019s role in this case, how\never, the plea agreement question becomes significantly\nmore difficult. The Solicitor General argues that the\nagreement does not bar the contempt prosecution, even if\nthat prosecution is correctly viewed as on behalf of the\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The difficult aspects of that legal\nissue, however, should not cause us to shy away from\nanswering the fundamental threshold question whether a\ncriminal prosecution may be brought on behalf and in the\ninterest of a private party. Having decided that threshold\nquestion in favor of Robertson, I would remand to the\ncourt below to consider the plea agreement from the\nproper starting point.\n  In light of all the foregoing, it is worth stressing that the\nmajority\u2019s determination not to decide that question \u201ccar\nries with it no implication whatever regarding the Court\u2019s\nviews on the merits.\u201d Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show,\nInc., 338 U. S. 912, 919 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., respecting\ndenial of certiorari).\n                          *    *   *\n   Allegorical depictions of the law frequently show a\nfigure wielding a sword\u2014the sword of justice, to be used to\nsmite those who violate the criminal laws. Indeed, outside\nour own courthouse you will find a statue of more than 30\ntons, Authority of Law, which portrays a male figure with\nsuch a sword. According to the sculptor, James Earle\nFraser (who also designed the buffalo nickel), the figure\nsits \u201cwait[ing] with concentrated attention, holding in his\nleft hand the tablet of laws, backed by the sheathed sword,\nsymbolic of enforcement through law.\u201d Supreme Court of\nthe United States, Office of the Curator, Contemplation of\nJustice and Authority of Law Information Sheet 2 (2009)\n(available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). A basic step in\norganizing a civilized society is to take that sword out of\nprivate hands and turn it over to an organized govern\nment, acting on behalf of all the people. Indeed, \u201c[t]he . . .\npower a man has in the state of nature is the power to\npunish the crimes committed against that law. [But this]\nhe gives up when he joins [a] . . . political society, and\nincorporates into [a] commonwealth.\u201d         Locke, Second\n12     ROBERTSON v. UNITED STATES EX REL. WATSON\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nTreatise, \u00a7128, at 64.\n   The ruling below contravenes that fundamental proposi\ntion, and should not be allowed to stand. At the very least,\nwe should do what we decided to do when we granted\ncertiorari, and took the unusual step of rephrasing the\nquestion presented: answer it.\n   I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s belated determi\nnation not to answer that question.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.
