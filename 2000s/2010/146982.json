MARCUS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–1341. Argued February 24, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nRespondent Marcus was convicted of engaging in forced labor and sex\n  trafficking between January 1999 and October 2001. On appeal, he\n  pointed out for the first time that the federal statutes he violated did\n  not become law until October 2000. Thus, he claimed, the indictment\n  and evidence permitted at trial allowed a jury to convict him exclu\n  sively on the basis of preenactment conduct in violation of the Ex Post\n  Facto Clause. He conceded that he had not raised this objection in\n  the District Court, but argued that because the constitutional error\n  was plain, his conviction must be set aside. The Second Circuit\n  agreed and vacated the conviction. In doing so, the court held that,\n  even in the case of a continuing offense, retrial is necessary if there is\n  “any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could have\n  convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment conduct.” The court\n  noted that this was “true even under plain error review.”\nHeld: The Second Circuit’s plain-error standard conflicts with this\n Court’s interpretation of the plain-error rule. An appellate court may\n recognize a “plain error that affects substantial rights,” even if that\n error was “not brought” to the district court’s “attention.” Fed. Rule\n Crim. Proc. 52(b). This Court’s cases interpret this rule such that an\n appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at\n trial only when the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error;\n (2) the error is clear or obvious; (3) the error affected the appellant’s\n substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, in\n tegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n    The standard the Second Circuit applied in this case is inconsistent\n  with the third and fourth of these criteria. To begin, it is irreconcil\n  able with the criterion that the error “affec[t] the appellant’s substan\n2                     UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tial rights,” Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. This condi\n    tion requires the error to be prejudicial, meaning that there is a rea\n    sonable probability that the error affected the trial’s outcome, not\n    that there is “any possibility,” however remote, that the jury could\n    have convicted based exclusively on preenactment conduct.\n       Nor does this error fall within the category of “structural errors”\n    that may “affect substantial rights” regardless of their actual impact\n    on an appellant’s trial. Id., at ___. Here, a jury instruction might\n    have minimized or eliminated the risk that Marcus would have been\n    convicted based solely on preenactment conduct. A reviewing court\n    should find it no more difficult to assess the failure to give such an\n    instruction than to assess numerous other instructional errors previ\n    ously found nonstructural, see, e.g., Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___\n    (per curiam). The Court further rejects Marcus’ argument that the\n    error at issue should be labeled an Ex Post Facto Clause violation,\n    and that all such violations should be treated as special, structural\n    errors warranting reversal without a showing of prejudice. As an ini\n    tial matter, the Government never argued that the statute that\n    criminalized Marcus’ conduct applied retroactively, and Marcus’\n    claim is thus properly brought under the Due Process, and not the\n    Ex Post Facto, Clause. Moreover, we see no reason why errors simi\n    lar to the one at issue in this case, taken as a class, would automati\n    cally affect substantial rights without a showing of prejudice.\n       In any event, the Second Circuit’s “any possibility,” however re\n    mote, standard also cannot be reconciled with the criterion that “the\n    error seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n    judicial proceedings.” Puckett, supra, at ___ (internal quotation\n    marks omitted). Under the Second Circuit’s approach, a retrial\n    would be required even where the evidence supporting conviction\n    consists of a few days of preenactment conduct along with several\n    continuous years of identical postenactment conduct. Given the tiny\n    risk that a jury would base its conviction in these circumstances on\n    the few preenactment days alone, such an error is most unlikely to\n    cast serious doubt on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n    the judicial system.

GLENN MARCUS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The question before us concerns an appellate court’s\n“plain error” review of a claim not raised at trial. See Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 52(b). The Second Circuit has said that\nit must recognize a “plain error” if there is “any possibil\nity,” however remote, that a jury convicted a defendant\nexclusively on the basis of actions taken before enactment\nof the statute that made those actions criminal. 538 F. 3d\n97, 102 (2008) (per curiam) (emphasis added). In our view,\nthe Second Circuit’s standard is inconsistent with this\nCourt’s “plain error” cases. We therefore reverse.\n                               I\n  A federal grand jury indicted respondent Glenn Marcus\non charges that he engaged in unlawful forced labor and\nsex trafficking between “ ‘January 1999 and October\n2001.’ ” Id., at 100; see also 18 U. S. C. §§1589, 1591(a)(1).\nAt trial, the Government presented evidence of his conduct\nduring that entire period. 538 F. 3d, at 100. And a jury\nfound him guilty of both charges. Ibid.\n  On appeal, Marcus pointed out for the first time that the\nstatutes he violated were enacted as part of the Traffick\ning Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), which did not\n2                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecome law until October 28, 2000. §112(a)(2), 114 Stat.\n1486. Marcus noted that the indictment and the evidence\npresented at trial permitted a jury to convict him exclu\nsively upon the basis of actions that he took before October\n28, 2000. And for that reason, Marcus argued that his\nconviction violated the Constitution—in Marcus’ view, the\nEx Post Facto Clause, Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Marcus conceded\nthat he had not objected on these grounds in the District\nCourt. Letter Brief for Appellant in No. 07–4005–cr\n(CA2), p. 12. But, he said, the constitutional error is\n“plain,” and his conviction therefore must be set aside.\nId., at 13.\n   The Government replied by arguing that Marcus’ con\nviction was for a single course of conduct, some of which\ntook place before, and some of which took place after, the\nstatute’s enactment date. 538 F. 3d, at 101. The Consti\ntution, it said, does not forbid the application of a new\nstatute to such a course of conduct so long as the course of\nconduct continued after the enactment of the statute. See,\ne.g., United States v. Harris, 79 F. 3d 223, 229 (CA2 1996);\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F. 3d 97, 104 (CA2 1994).\nThe Government conceded that the conviction could not\nrest exclusively upon conduct which took place before the\nTVPA’s enactment, but it argued that the possibility that\nthe jury here had convicted on that basis was “ ‘remote.’ ”\n538 F. 3d, at 102. Hence, the Government claimed, it was\nhighly unlikely that the judge’s failure to make this aspect\nof the law clear (say, by explaining to the jury that it could\nnot convict based on preenactment conduct alone) affected\nMarcus’ “substantial rights.” Letter Brief for United\nStates in No. 07–4005–cr (CA2), p. 9. And the Govern\nment thus argued that the court should not recognize a\n“plain error.” Ibid.\n   The Second Circuit noted that Marcus had not raised\nhis ex post facto argument in the District Court. 538 F. 3d,\nat 102. The court also recognized that, under Circuit\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent, the Constitution did not prohibit conviction for\na “ ‘continuing offense’ ” so long as the conviction rested, at\nleast in part, upon postenactment conduct. Id., at 101\n(quoting Harris, supra, at 229). But, the court held, “even\nin the case of a continuing offense, if it was possible for the\njury—wh[ich] had not been given instructions regarding\nthe date of enactment—to convict exclusively on [the basis\nof] pre-enactment conduct, then the conviction constitutes\na violation” of the Ex Post Facto Clause. 538 F. 3d, at 101.\nThe court noted that this was “true even under plain error\nreview.” Ibid. In short, under the Second Circuit’s ap\nproach, “a retrial is necessary whenever there is any\npossibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could\nhave convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment con\nduct.” Id., at 102 (emphasis added).\n  The Government sought certiorari. And we granted the\nwrit, agreeing to decide whether the Second Circuit’s\napproach to “plain error” review, as we have set it forth,\nconflicts with this Court’s interpretation of the “plain\nerror” rule. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).\n                               II\n  Rule 52(b) permits an appellate court to recognize a\n“plain error that affects substantial rights,” even if the\nclaim of error was “not brought” to the district court’s\n“attention.” Lower courts, of course, must apply the Rule\nas this Court has interpreted it. And the cases that set\nforth our interpretation hold that an appellate court may,\nin its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only\nwhere the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an\n“error”; (2) the error is “clear or obvious, rather than sub\nject to reasonable dispute”; (3) the error “affected the\nappellant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case\nmeans” it “affected the outcome of the district court pro\nceedings”; and (4) “the error seriously affect[s] the fair\nness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed\n4                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nings.” Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731–737 (1993);\nJohnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 466–467 (1997);\nUnited States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 631–632 (2002).\n   In our view, the Second Circuit’s standard is inconsis\ntent with the third and the fourth criteria set forth in\nthese cases. The third criterion specifies that a “plain\nerror” must “affec[t]” the appellant’s “substantial rights.”\nIn the ordinary case, to meet this standard an error must\nbe “prejudicial,” which means that there must be a rea\nsonable probability that the error affected the outcome of\nthe trial. Olano, supra, at 734–735 (stating that, to satisfy\nthe third criterion of Rule 52(b), a defendant must “nor\nmally” demonstrate that the alleged error was not “harm\nless”); see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\nU. S. 74, 83 (2004). The Court of Appeals, however, would\nnotice a “plain error” and set aside a conviction whenever\nthere exists “any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that\nthe jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre\nenactment conduct.” 538 F. 3d, at 102 (emphasis added).\nThis standard is irreconcilable with our “plain error”\nprecedent. See, e.g., Olano, supra, at 734–735.\n   We recognize that our cases speak of a need for a show\ning that the error affected the “outcome of the district\ncourt proceedings” in the “ordinary case.” Puckett, 556\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And we have noted the possibility that certain\nerrors, termed “structural errors,” might “affect substan\ntial rights” regardless of their actual impact on an appel\nlant’s trial. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (reserving the\nquestion whether “structural errors” automatically satisfy\nthe third “plain error” criterion); Cotton, supra, at 632\n(same); Johnson, supra, at 469 (same); Olano, supra, at\n735 (same). But “structural errors” are “a very limited\nclass” of errors that affect the “ ‘framework within which\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe trial proceeds,’ ” Johnson, supra, at 468 (quoting Ari\nzona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)), such that\nit is often “difficul[t]” to “asses[s] the effect of the error,”\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 149, n. 4\n(2006). See Johnson, supra, at 468–469 (citing cases in\nwhich this Court has found “structural error,” including\nGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (total depriva\ntion of counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (lack\nof an impartial trial judge); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465\nU. S. 168 (1984) (right to self-representation at trial);\nWaller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984) (violation of the\nright to a public trial); and Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508\nU. S. 275 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction)).\nWe cannot conclude that the error here falls within that\ncategory.\n   The error at issue in this case created a risk that the\njury would convict respondent solely on the basis of con\nduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in\nthat conduct. A judge might have minimized, if not elimi\nnated, this risk by giving the jury a proper instruction.\nWe see no reason why, when a judge fails to give such an\ninstruction, a reviewing court would find it any more\ndifficult to assess the likely consequences of that failure\nthan with numerous other kinds of instructional errors\nthat we have previously held to be non-“structural”—for\nexample, instructing a jury as to an invalid alternative\ntheory of guilt, Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (2008)\n(per curiam), omitting mention of an element of an offense,\nNeder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999), or erroneously\ninstructing the jury on an element, Yates v. Evatt, 500\nU. S. 391 (1991); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263\n(1989) (per curiam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987);\nRose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570 (1986).\n   Marcus argues that, like the Second Circuit, we should\napply the label “Ex Post Facto Clause violation” to the\nerror in this case, and that we should then treat all errors\n6                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nso labeled as special, “structural,” errors that warrant\nreversal without a showing of prejudice. See Brief for\nRespondent 27–29. But we cannot accept this argument.\nAs an initial matter, we note that the Government has\nnever claimed that the TVPA retroactively criminalizes\npreenactment conduct, see Brief for United States 16, and\nthat Marcus and the Second Circuit were thus incorrect to\nclassify the error at issue here as an Ex Post Facto Clause\nviolation, see Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 191\n(1977) (“The Ex Post Facto Clause is a limitation upon the\npowers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force\napply to the Judicial Branch of government” (citation\nomitted)). Rather, if the jury, which was not instructed\nabout the TVPA’s enactment date, erroneously convicted\nMarcus based exclusively on noncriminal, preenactment\nconduct, Marcus would have a valid due process claim. Cf.\nBouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 353–354 (1964)\n(applying Due Process Clause to ex post facto judicial\ndecisions). In any event, however Marcus’ claim is la\nbeled, we see no reason why this kind of error would\nautomatically “affect substantial rights” without a show\ning of individual prejudice.\n  That is because errors similar to the one at issue in this\ncase—i.e., errors that create a risk that a defendant will be\nconvicted based exclusively on noncriminal conduct—come\nin various shapes and sizes. The kind and degree of harm\nthat such errors create can consequently vary. Sometimes\na proper jury instruction might well avoid harm; other\ntimes, preventing the harm might only require striking or\nlimiting the testimony of a particular witness. And some\ntimes the error might infect an entire trial, such that a\njury instruction would mean little. There is thus no rea\nson to believe that all or almost all such errors always\n“affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds,”\nFulminante, supra, at 310, or “necessarily render a crimi\nnal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermining guilt or innocence,” Neder, supra, at 9 (em\nphasis deleted).\n   Moreover, while the rights at issue in this case are\nimportant, they do not differ significantly in importance\nfrom the constitutional rights at issue in other cases\nwhere we have insisted upon a showing of individual\nprejudice. See Fulminante, supra, at 306–307 (collecting\ncases). Indeed, we have said that “if the defendant had\ncounsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is\na strong presumption that any other errors that may have\noccurred” are not “structural errors.” Rose, supra, at 579.\nNo one here denies that defendant had counsel and was\ntried by an impartial adjudicator.\n   In any event, the Second Circuit’s approach also cannot\nbe reconciled with this Court’s fourth “plain error” crite\nrion, which permits an appeals court to recognize “plain\nerror” only if the error “seriously affect[s] the fairness,\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”\nJohnson, 520 U. S., at 467 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In cases applying this fourth criterion, we have\nsuggested that, in most circumstances, an error that does\nnot affect the jury’s verdict does not significantly impugn\nthe “fairness,” “integrity,” or “public reputation” of the\njudicial process. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted);\nCotton, 535 U. S., at 633. The Second Circuit’s “any possi\nbility, no matter how unlikely” standard, however, would\nrequire finding a “plain error” in a case where the evi\ndence supporting a conviction consisted of, say, a few days\nof preenactment conduct along with several continuous\nyears of identical postenactment conduct. Given the tiny\nrisk that the jury would have based its conviction upon\nthose few preenactment days alone, a refusal to recognize\nsuch an error as a “plain error” (and to set aside the ver\ndict) is most unlikely to cast serious doubt on the “fair\nness,” “integrity,” or “public reputation” of the judicial\nsystem.\n8                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We do not intend to trivialize the claim that respondent\nhere raises. Nor do we imply that the kind of error at\nissue here is unimportant. But the rule that permits\ncourts to recognize a “plain error” does not “remove” “se\nriou[s]” errors “from the ambit of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure.” Johnson, supra, at 466. Rather, the\n“plain error” rule, as interpreted by this Court, sets forth\ncriteria that a claim of error not raised at trial must sat\nisfy. The Second Circuit’s rule would require reversal\nunder the “plain error” standard for errors that do not\nmeet those criteria. We can find no good reason to treat\nrespondent’s claim of error differently from others. See\nPuckett, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (reviewing the\nGovernment’s violation of a plea agreement for “plain\nerror”); Cotton, supra, at 631–632 (reviewing an indict\nment’s failure to charge a fact that increased defendant’s\nstatutory maximum sentence for “plain error”); Johnson,\nsupra, at 464 (reviewing the failure to submit an element\nof the crime to the jury for “plain error”). Hence we must\nreject the Second Circuit’s rule.\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed. As the Court of Appeals has not yet consid\nered whether the error at issue in this case satisfies this\nCourt’s “plain error” standard—i.e., whether the error\naffects “substantial rights” and “the fairness, integrity, or\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings”—we remand the\ncase to that court so that it may do so.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration\nor decision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

I am more concerned with\nthis Court’s approach to, and policing of, Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 52(b).\n                              I\n  On October 28, 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking\nVictims Protection Act (TVPA), 114 Stat. 1466. Respon\ndent Glenn Marcus was convicted on two counts under the\nTVPA: one for sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U. S. C.\n§1591(a)(1), and one for forced labor, in violation of §1589.\nThe indictment charged conduct that spanned from Janu\nary 1999 to October 2001. See 538 F. 3d 97, 100 (CA2\n2008) (per curiam). The evidence introduced by the Gov\nernment at trial spanned from 1998 to 2003. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314006\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314006/united-states-v-marcus/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292–297 (EDNY 2007). Most of the evi\ndence supporting the sex trafficking charge, and some of\nthe evidence supporting the forced labor charge, related to\ndiscrete events that occurred before October 28, 2000.\n  At trial, Marcus failed to ask the judge to inform the\njury that his preenactment conduct was not unlawful, and\nthe judge failed to give an instruction to that effect. If a\n2                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrequest had been made, it is clear that an appropriate\ninstruction would have been given. Indeed, it is equally\nclear that the judge would have given such an instruction\nsua sponte if she had been aware of the effective date of\nthe statute. No one disputes that error was committed in\nthe way Marcus was charged and tried, and the error was\nsufficiently plain to be considered on appeal.\n  The record demonstrates that Marcus’ sex trafficking\nconviction likely violated the ex post facto rule, as applied\nto trial proceedings through the Due Process Clause, see\nante, at 6, because the postenactment evidence appears to\nhave been insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See 538 F. 3d, at 105–106 (Sotomayor, J., concur\nring). Whether his forced labor conviction is invalid for\nthe same reason is not clear. What is clear, however, is\nthat neither the Second Circuit nor this Court has to\ndetermine that an error of constitutional magnitude oc\ncurred for Marcus to be eligible for relief. The question\nunder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) is\nwhether the trial error was sufficiently weighty to affect\n“substantial rights,” and in my view this error surely was.\n  The Court notes that the error “created a risk that the\njury would convict respondent solely on the basis of con\nduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in\nthat conduct.” Ante, at 5. That is true, and it is of funda\nmental concern because imposing criminal sanctions for\nnonproscribed conduct has always been considered a\nhallmark of tyranny—no matter how morally reprehensi\nble the prosecuted party.\n  But in addition to the very real possibility that the jury\nconvicted Marcus of sex trafficking solely on the basis of\npreenactment conduct, the error created another risk:\nnamely, that both verdicts, returned after seven days of\ndeliberation, rested in part on the jury’s incorrect belief\nthat the conduct before October 28, 2000, was unlawful.\nThe error committed at trial not only prevented the jury\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfrom focusing on the relevant time period, but it also\ndistorted the jury’s perception of Marcus’ actions. By\narguing that its preenactment evidence showed a violation\nof the TVPA, the Government effectively mischaracterized\nall of that evidence as descriptions of illegal behavior. And\nby giving the jury the impression that Marcus committed\na much larger amount of criminal conduct than he really\ndid, the error may have tipped the scales in favor of the\nprosecution, when the actual evidence of guilt would not\nhave persuaded the jury to convict.\n   There is no need to decide whether the Government’s\narguments or the trial court’s failure to give a curative\ninstruction reached a level of unfairness sufficient to\nviolate the Due Process Clause. For the foregoing reasons,\nI am convinced that the error prejudiced Marcus and\nseriously undermined the integrity of the proceedings.\nWhile I do not endorse the reasoning in the Court of Ap\npeals’ opinion,* I would therefore affirm its judgment.\n\n\n\n——————\n   * The per curiam opinion contained a curious wrinkle, apart from\nmisclassifying the trial error. See ante, at 6. The per curiam applied a\nstandard from earlier Second Circuit cases that asked whether there\nwas any possibility the jury convicted the defendant exclusively on the\nbasis of preenactment conduct. 538 F. 3d 97, 101 (CA2 2008) (citing\nUnited States v. Torres, 901 F. 2d 205, 229 (1990), United States v.\nMonaco, 194 F. 3d 381, 386 (1999), and United States v. Harris, 79\nF. 3d 223, 229 (1996)). As I read the Second Circuit precedents, how\never, they used that standard to determine whether an ex post facto\nviolation occurred, not to determine whether that violation warranted\nvacatur of the conviction pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Proce\ndure 52(b). Torres is the only one of the cited cases that even consid\nered Rule 52(b), and its holding rested on a combination of factors,\nincluding that “the defendants brought the general ex post facto ques\ntion to the attention of the district court,” albeit imprecisely, and that a\nmandatory life sentence was imposed. 901 F. 2d, at 229. It is thus\nunclear why the Court of Appeals believed itself foreclosed from con\nducting a regular “plain error” review.\n4                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                              II\n  The Court does not engage the merits of that judgment,\nbut instead remands to the Court of Appeals to apply the\ntest we have devised for evaluating claims of “plain error.”\nThat test requires lower courts to conduct four separate\ninquiries, each of which requires a distinct form of judg\nment and several of which have generated significant\nappellate-court dissensus; the test may also contain an\nexception for “structural errors,” a category we have never\ndefined clearly. With great concision, the Court manages\nto summarize all of these moving parts in about five\npages. Ante, at 3–8.\n  Yet the language of Rule 52(b) is straightforward. It\nstates simply: “A plain error that affects substantial rights\nmay be considered even though it was not brought to the\ncourt’s attention.” This is the mirror image of Rule 52(a),\nwhich instructs courts to disregard any error “that does\nnot affect substantial rights.” The Federal Rules thus set\nforth a unitary standard, which turns on whether the\nerror in question affected substantial rights (either in a\nparticular defendant’s case or in the mine run of compara\nble cases), and they leave it to judges to figure out how\nbest to apply that standard.\n  In our attempt to clarify Rule 52(b), we have, I fear,\nboth muddied the waters and lost sight of the wisdom\nembodied in the Rule’s spare text. Errors come in an\nendless variety of “shapes and sizes.” Ante, at 6. Because\nerror-free trials are so rare, appellate courts must repeat\nedly confront the question whether a trial judge’s mistake\nwas harmless or warrants reversal. They become familiar\nwith particular judges and with the vast panoply of trial\nprocedures, they acquire special expertise in dealing with\nrecurring issues, and their doctrine evolves over time to\nhelp clarify and classify various types of mistakes. These\nare just a few of the reasons why federal appellate courts\nare “allowed a wide measure of discretion in the supervi\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nsion of litigation in their respective circuits.” United\nStates v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 745 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). This Court’s ever more intensive efforts to\nrationalize plain-error review may have been born of a\nworthy instinct. But they have trapped the appellate\ncourts in an analytic maze that, I have increasingly come\nto believe, is more liable to frustrate than to facilitate\nsound decisionmaking.\n  The trial error at issue in this case undermined the\ndefendant’s substantial rights by allowing the jury to\nconvict him on the basis of an incorrect belief that lawful\nconduct was unlawful, and it does not take an elaborate\nformula to see that. Because, in my view, the Court of\nAppeals properly exercised its discretion to remedy the\nerror and to order a retrial, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>", "id": 146982, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2010/05/24/United_States_v._Marcus.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2009                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

MARCUS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–1341. Argued February 24, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nRespondent Marcus was convicted of engaging in forced labor and sex\n  trafficking between January 1999 and October 2001. On appeal, he\n  pointed out for the first time that the federal statutes he violated did\n  not become law until October 2000. Thus, he claimed, the indictment\n  and evidence permitted at trial allowed a jury to convict him exclu\n  sively on the basis of preenactment conduct in violation of the Ex Post\n  Facto Clause. He conceded that he had not raised this objection in\n  the District Court, but argued that because the constitutional error\n  was plain, his conviction must be set aside. The Second Circuit\n  agreed and vacated the conviction. In doing so, the court held that,\n  even in the case of a continuing offense, retrial is necessary if there is\n  “any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could have\n  convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment conduct.” The court\n  noted that this was “true even under plain error review.”\nHeld: The Second Circuit’s plain-error standard conflicts with this\n Court’s interpretation of the plain-error rule. An appellate court may\n recognize a “plain error that affects substantial rights,” even if that\n error was “not brought” to the district court’s “attention.” Fed. Rule\n Crim. Proc. 52(b). This Court’s cases interpret this rule such that an\n appellate court may, in its discretion, correct an error not raised at\n trial only when the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an error;\n (2) the error is clear or obvious; (3) the error affected the appellant’s\n substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, in\n tegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n    The standard the Second Circuit applied in this case is inconsistent\n  with the third and fourth of these criteria. To begin, it is irreconcil\n  able with the criterion that the error “affec[t] the appellant’s substan\n2                     UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tial rights,” Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___. This condi\n    tion requires the error to be prejudicial, meaning that there is a rea\n    sonable probability that the error affected the trial’s outcome, not\n    that there is “any possibility,” however remote, that the jury could\n    have convicted based exclusively on preenactment conduct.\n       Nor does this error fall within the category of “structural errors”\n    that may “affect substantial rights” regardless of their actual impact\n    on an appellant’s trial. Id., at ___. Here, a jury instruction might\n    have minimized or eliminated the risk that Marcus would have been\n    convicted based solely on preenactment conduct. A reviewing court\n    should find it no more difficult to assess the failure to give such an\n    instruction than to assess numerous other instructional errors previ\n    ously found nonstructural, see, e.g., Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___\n    (per curiam). The Court further rejects Marcus’ argument that the\n    error at issue should be labeled an Ex Post Facto Clause violation,\n    and that all such violations should be treated as special, structural\n    errors warranting reversal without a showing of prejudice. As an ini\n    tial matter, the Government never argued that the statute that\n    criminalized Marcus’ conduct applied retroactively, and Marcus’\n    claim is thus properly brought under the Due Process, and not the\n    Ex Post Facto, Clause. Moreover, we see no reason why errors simi\n    lar to the one at issue in this case, taken as a class, would automati\n    cally affect substantial rights without a showing of prejudice.\n       In any event, the Second Circuit’s “any possibility,” however re\n    mote, standard also cannot be reconciled with the criterion that “the\n    error seriously affec[t] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of\n    judicial proceedings.” Puckett, supra, at ___ (internal quotation\n    marks omitted). Under the Second Circuit’s approach, a retrial\n    would be required even where the evidence supporting conviction\n    consists of a few days of preenactment conduct along with several\n    continuous years of identical postenactment conduct. Given the tiny\n    risk that a jury would base its conviction in these circumstances on\n    the few preenactment days alone, such an error is most unlikely to\n    cast serious doubt on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n    the judicial system.

See Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 52(b). The Second Circuit has said that\nit must recognize a “plain error” if there is “any possibil\nity,” however remote, that a jury convicted a defendant\nexclusively on the basis of actions taken before enactment\nof the statute that made those actions criminal. 538 F. 3d\n97, 102 (2008) (per curiam) (emphasis added). In our view,\nthe Second Circuit’s standard is inconsistent with this\nCourt’s “plain error” cases. We therefore reverse.\n                               I\n  A federal grand jury indicted respondent Glenn Marcus\non charges that he engaged in unlawful forced labor and\nsex trafficking between “ ‘January 1999 and October\n2001.’ ” Id., at 100; see also 18 U. S. C. §§1589, 1591(a)(1).\nAt trial, the Government presented evidence of his conduct\nduring that entire period. 538 F. 3d, at 100. And a jury\nfound him guilty of both charges. Ibid.\n  On appeal, Marcus pointed out for the first time that the\nstatutes he violated were enacted as part of the Traffick\ning Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), which did not\n2                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbecome law until October 28, 2000. §112(a)(2), 114 Stat.\n1486. Marcus noted that the indictment and the evidence\npresented at trial permitted a jury to convict him exclu\nsively upon the basis of actions that he took before October\n28, 2000. And for that reason, Marcus argued that his\nconviction violated the Constitution—in Marcus’ view, the\nEx Post Facto Clause, Art. I, §9, cl. 3. Marcus conceded\nthat he had not objected on these grounds in the District\nCourt. Letter Brief for Appellant in No. 07–4005–cr\n(CA2), p. 12. But, he said, the constitutional error is\n“plain,” and his conviction therefore must be set aside.\nId., at 13.\n   The Government replied by arguing that Marcus’ con\nviction was for a single course of conduct, some of which\ntook place before, and some of which took place after, the\nstatute’s enactment date. 538 F. 3d, at 101. The Consti\ntution, it said, does not forbid the application of a new\nstatute to such a course of conduct so long as the course of\nconduct continued after the enactment of the statute. See,\ne.g., United States v. Harris, 79 F. 3d 223, 229 (CA2 1996);\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F. 3d 97, 104 (CA2 1994).\nThe Government conceded that the conviction could not\nrest exclusively upon conduct which took place before the\nTVPA’s enactment, but it argued that the possibility that\nthe jury here had convicted on that basis was “ ‘remote.’ ”\n538 F. 3d, at 102. Hence, the Government claimed, it was\nhighly unlikely that the judge’s failure to make this aspect\nof the law clear (say, by explaining to the jury that it could\nnot convict based on preenactment conduct alone) affected\nMarcus’ “substantial rights.” Letter Brief for United\nStates in No. 07–4005–cr (CA2), p. 9. And the Govern\nment thus argued that the court should not recognize a\n“plain error.” Ibid.\n   The Second Circuit noted that Marcus had not raised\nhis ex post facto argument in the District Court. 538 F. 3d,\nat 102. The court also recognized that, under Circuit\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprecedent, the Constitution did not prohibit conviction for\na “ ‘continuing offense’ ” so long as the conviction rested, at\nleast in part, upon postenactment conduct. Id., at 101\n(quoting Harris, supra, at 229). But, the court held, “even\nin the case of a continuing offense, if it was possible for the\njury—wh[ich] had not been given instructions regarding\nthe date of enactment—to convict exclusively on [the basis\nof] pre-enactment conduct, then the conviction constitutes\na violation” of the Ex Post Facto Clause. 538 F. 3d, at 101.\nThe court noted that this was “true even under plain error\nreview.” Ibid. In short, under the Second Circuit’s ap\nproach, “a retrial is necessary whenever there is any\npossibility, no matter how unlikely, that the jury could\nhave convicted based exclusively on pre-enactment con\nduct.” Id., at 102 (emphasis added).\n  The Government sought certiorari. And we granted the\nwrit, agreeing to decide whether the Second Circuit’s\napproach to “plain error” review, as we have set it forth,\nconflicts with this Court’s interpretation of the “plain\nerror” rule. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).\n                               II\n  Rule 52(b) permits an appellate court to recognize a\n“plain error that affects substantial rights,” even if the\nclaim of error was “not brought” to the district court’s\n“attention.” Lower courts, of course, must apply the Rule\nas this Court has interpreted it. And the cases that set\nforth our interpretation hold that an appellate court may,\nin its discretion, correct an error not raised at trial only\nwhere the appellant demonstrates that (1) there is an\n“error”; (2) the error is “clear or obvious, rather than sub\nject to reasonable dispute”; (3) the error “affected the\nappellant’s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case\nmeans” it “affected the outcome of the district court pro\nceedings”; and (4) “the error seriously affect[s] the fair\nness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed\n4                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nings.” Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731–737 (1993);\nJohnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 466–467 (1997);\nUnited States v. Cotton, 535 U. S. 625, 631–632 (2002).\n   In our view, the Second Circuit’s standard is inconsis\ntent with the third and the fourth criteria set forth in\nthese cases. The third criterion specifies that a “plain\nerror” must “affec[t]” the appellant’s “substantial rights.”\nIn the ordinary case, to meet this standard an error must\nbe “prejudicial,” which means that there must be a rea\nsonable probability that the error affected the outcome of\nthe trial. Olano, supra, at 734–735 (stating that, to satisfy\nthe third criterion of Rule 52(b), a defendant must “nor\nmally” demonstrate that the alleged error was not “harm\nless”); see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542\nU. S. 74, 83 (2004). The Court of Appeals, however, would\nnotice a “plain error” and set aside a conviction whenever\nthere exists “any possibility, no matter how unlikely, that\nthe jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre\nenactment conduct.” 538 F. 3d, at 102 (emphasis added).\nThis standard is irreconcilable with our “plain error”\nprecedent. See, e.g., Olano, supra, at 734–735.\n   We recognize that our cases speak of a need for a show\ning that the error affected the “outcome of the district\ncourt proceedings” in the “ordinary case.” Puckett, 556\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And we have noted the possibility that certain\nerrors, termed “structural errors,” might “affect substan\ntial rights” regardless of their actual impact on an appel\nlant’s trial. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (reserving the\nquestion whether “structural errors” automatically satisfy\nthe third “plain error” criterion); Cotton, supra, at 632\n(same); Johnson, supra, at 469 (same); Olano, supra, at\n735 (same). But “structural errors” are “a very limited\nclass” of errors that affect the “ ‘framework within which\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

S. 279, 310 (1991)), such that\nit is often “difficul[t]” to “asses[s] the effect of the error,”\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 149, n. 4\n(2006). See Johnson, supra, at 468–469 (citing cases in\nwhich this Court has found “structural error,” including\nGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (total depriva\ntion of counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (lack\nof an impartial trial judge); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465\nU. S. 168 (1984) (right to self-representation at trial);\nWaller v. Georgia, 467 U. S. 39 (1984) (violation of the\nright to a public trial); and Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508\nU. S. 275 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction)).\nWe cannot conclude that the error here falls within that\ncategory.\n   The error at issue in this case created a risk that the\njury would convict respondent solely on the basis of con\nduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in\nthat conduct. A judge might have minimized, if not elimi\nnated, this risk by giving the jury a proper instruction.\nWe see no reason why, when a judge fails to give such an\ninstruction, a reviewing court would find it any more\ndifficult to assess the likely consequences of that failure\nthan with numerous other kinds of instructional errors\nthat we have previously held to be non-“structural”—for\nexample, instructing a jury as to an invalid alternative\ntheory of guilt, Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U. S. ___ (2008)\n(per curiam), omitting mention of an element of an offense,\nNeder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1 (1999), or erroneously\ninstructing the jury on an element, Yates v.

S. 570 (1986).\n   Marcus argues that, like the Second Circuit, we should\napply the label “Ex Post Facto Clause violation” to the\nerror in this case, and that we should then treat all errors\n6                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nso labeled as special, “structural,” errors that warrant\nreversal without a showing of prejudice. See Brief for\nRespondent 27–29. But we cannot accept this argument.\nAs an initial matter, we note that the Government has\nnever claimed that the TVPA retroactively criminalizes\npreenactment conduct, see Brief for United States 16, and\nthat Marcus and the Second Circuit were thus incorrect to\nclassify the error at issue here as an Ex Post Facto Clause\nviolation, see Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 191\n(1977) (“The Ex Post Facto Clause is a limitation upon the\npowers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force\napply to the Judicial Branch of government” (citation\nomitted)). Rather, if the jury, which was not instructed\nabout the TVPA’s enactment date, erroneously convicted\nMarcus based exclusively on noncriminal, preenactment\nconduct, Marcus would have a valid due process claim. Cf.\nBouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347, 353–354 (1964)\n(applying Due Process Clause to ex post facto judicial\ndecisions). In any event, however Marcus’ claim is la\nbeled, we see no reason why this kind of error would\nautomatically “affect substantial rights” without a show\ning of individual prejudice.\n  That is because errors similar to the one at issue in this\ncase—i.e., errors that create a risk that a defendant will be\nconvicted based exclusively on noncriminal conduct—come\nin various shapes and sizes. The kind and degree of harm\nthat such errors create can consequently vary. Sometimes\na proper jury instruction might well avoid harm; other\ntimes, preventing the harm might only require striking or\nlimiting the testimony of a particular witness. And some\ntimes the error might infect an entire trial, such that a\njury instruction would mean little. There is thus no rea\nson to believe that all or almost all such errors always\n“affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds,”\nFulminante, supra, at 310, or “necessarily render a crimi\nnal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndetermining guilt or innocence,” Neder, supra, at 9 (em\nphasis deleted).\n   Moreover, while the rights at issue in this case are\nimportant, they do not differ significantly in importance\nfrom the constitutional rights at issue in other cases\nwhere we have insisted upon a showing of individual\nprejudice. See Fulminante, supra, at 306–307 (collecting\ncases). Indeed, we have said that “if the defendant had\ncounsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is\na strong presumption that any other errors that may have\noccurred” are not “structural errors.” Rose, supra, at 579.\nNo one here denies that defendant had counsel and was\ntried by an impartial adjudicator.\n   In any event, the Second Circuit’s approach also cannot\nbe reconciled with this Court’s fourth “plain error” crite\nrion, which permits an appeals court to recognize “plain\nerror” only if the error “seriously affect[s] the fairness,\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.”\nJohnson, 520 U. S., at 467 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In cases applying this fourth criterion, we have\nsuggested that, in most circumstances, an error that does\nnot affect the jury’s verdict does not significantly impugn\nthe “fairness,” “integrity,” or “public reputation” of the\njudicial process. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted);\nCotton, 535 U. S., at 633. The Second Circuit’s “any possi\nbility, no matter how unlikely” standard, however, would\nrequire finding a “plain error” in a case where the evi\ndence supporting a conviction consisted of, say, a few days\nof preenactment conduct along with several continuous\nyears of identical postenactment conduct. Given the tiny\nrisk that the jury would have based its conviction upon\nthose few preenactment days alone, a refusal to recognize\nsuch an error as a “plain error” (and to set aside the ver\ndict) is most unlikely to cast serious doubt on the “fair\nness,” “integrity,” or “public reputation” of the judicial\nsystem.\n8                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   We do not intend to trivialize the claim that respondent\nhere raises. Nor do we imply that the kind of error at\nissue here is unimportant. But the rule that permits\ncourts to recognize a “plain error” does not “remove” “se\nriou[s]” errors “from the ambit of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure.” Johnson, supra, at 466. Rather, the\n“plain error” rule, as interpreted by this Court, sets forth\ncriteria that a claim of error not raised at trial must sat\nisfy. The Second Circuit’s rule would require reversal\nunder the “plain error” standard for errors that do not\nmeet those criteria. We can find no good reason to treat\nrespondent’s claim of error differently from others. See\nPuckett, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (reviewing the\nGovernment’s violation of a plea agreement for “plain\nerror”); Cotton, supra, at 631–632 (reviewing an indict\nment’s failure to charge a fact that increased defendant’s\nstatutory maximum sentence for “plain error”); Johnson,\nsupra, at 464 (reviewing the failure to submit an element\nof the crime to the jury for “plain error”). Hence we must\nreject the Second Circuit’s rule.\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nis reversed. As the Court of Appeals has not yet consid\nered whether the error at issue in this case satisfies this\nCourt’s “plain error” standard—i.e., whether the error\naffects “substantial rights” and “the fairness, integrity, or\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings”—we remand the\ncase to that court so that it may do so.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration\nor decision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Yet while it may have taken an un\nusual route to get there, I find nothing wrong with the\nCourt of Appeals’ judgment. I am more concerned with\nthis Court’s approach to, and policing of, Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 52(b).\n                              I\n  On October 28, 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking\nVictims Protection Act (TVPA), 114 Stat. 1466. Respon\ndent Glenn Marcus was convicted on two counts under the\nTVPA: one for sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U. S. C.\n§1591(a)(1), and one for forced labor, in violation of §1589.\nThe indictment charged conduct that spanned from Janu\nary 1999 to October 2001. See 538 F. 3d 97, 100 (CA2\n2008) (per curiam). The evidence introduced by the Gov\nernment at trial spanned from 1998 to 2003. See 487\nF. Supp. 2d 289, 292–297 (EDNY 2007). Most of the evi\ndence supporting the sex trafficking charge, and some of\nthe evidence supporting the forced labor charge, related to\ndiscrete events that occurred before October 28, 2000.\n  At trial, Marcus failed to ask the judge to inform the\njury that his preenactment conduct was not unlawful, and\nthe judge failed to give an instruction to that effect. If a\n2                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrequest had been made, it is clear that an appropriate\ninstruction would have been given. Indeed, it is equally\nclear that the judge would have given such an instruction\nsua sponte if she had been aware of the effective date of\nthe statute. No one disputes that error was committed in\nthe way Marcus was charged and tried, and the error was\nsufficiently plain to be considered on appeal.\n  The record demonstrates that Marcus’ sex trafficking\nconviction likely violated the ex post facto rule, as applied\nto trial proceedings through the Due Process Clause, see\nante, at 6, because the postenactment evidence appears to\nhave been insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. See 538 F. 3d, at 105–106 (Sotomayor, J., concur\nring). Whether his forced labor conviction is invalid for\nthe same reason is not clear. What is clear, however, is\nthat neither the Second Circuit nor this Court has to\ndetermine that an error of constitutional magnitude oc\ncurred for Marcus to be eligible for relief. The question\nunder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) is\nwhether the trial error was sufficiently weighty to affect\n“substantial rights,” and in my view this error surely was.\n  The Court notes that the error “created a risk that the\njury would convict respondent solely on the basis of con\nduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in\nthat conduct.” Ante, at 5. That is true, and it is of funda\nmental concern because imposing criminal sanctions for\nnonproscribed conduct has always been considered a\nhallmark of tyranny—no matter how morally reprehensi\nble the prosecuted party.\n  But in addition to the very real possibility that the jury\nconvicted Marcus of sex trafficking solely on the basis of\npreenactment conduct, the error created another risk:\nnamely, that both verdicts, returned after seven days of\ndeliberation, rested in part on the jury’s incorrect belief\nthat the conduct before October 28, 2000, was unlawful.\nThe error committed at trial not only prevented the jury\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfrom focusing on the relevant time period, but it also\ndistorted the jury’s perception of Marcus’ actions. By\narguing that its preenactment evidence showed a violation\nof the TVPA, the Government effectively mischaracterized\nall of that evidence as descriptions of illegal behavior. And\nby giving the jury the impression that Marcus committed\na much larger amount of criminal conduct than he really\ndid, the error may have tipped the scales in favor of the\nprosecution, when the actual evidence of guilt would not\nhave persuaded the jury to convict.\n   There is no need to decide whether the Government’s\narguments or the trial court’s failure to give a curative\ninstruction reached a level of unfairness sufficient to\nviolate the Due Process Clause. For the foregoing reasons,\nI am convinced that the error prejudiced Marcus and\nseriously undermined the integrity of the proceedings.\nWhile I do not endorse the reasoning in the Court of Ap\npeals’ opinion,* I would therefore affirm its judgment.\n\n\n\n——————\n   * The per curiam opinion contained a curious wrinkle, apart from\nmisclassifying the trial error. See ante, at 6. The per curiam applied a\nstandard from earlier Second Circuit cases that asked whether there\nwas any possibility the jury convicted the defendant exclusively on the\nbasis of preenactment conduct. 538 F. 3d 97, 101 (CA2 2008) (citing\nUnited States v. Torres, 901 F. 2d 205, 229 (1990), United States v.\nMonaco, 194 F. 3d 381, 386 (1999), and United States v. Harris, 79\nF. 3d 223, 229 (1996)). As I read the Second Circuit precedents, how\never, they used that standard to determine whether an ex post facto\nviolation occurred, not to determine whether that violation warranted\nvacatur of the conviction pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Proce\ndure 52(b). Torres is the only one of the cited cases that even consid\nered Rule 52(b), and its holding rested on a combination of factors,\nincluding that “the defendants brought the general ex post facto ques\ntion to the attention of the district court,” albeit imprecisely, and that a\nmandatory life sentence was imposed. 901 F. 2d, at 229. It is thus\nunclear why the Court of Appeals believed itself foreclosed from con\nducting a regular “plain error” review.\n4                UNITED STATES v. MARCUS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                              II\n  The Court does not engage the merits of that judgment,\nbut instead remands to the Court of Appeals to apply the\ntest we have devised for evaluating claims of “plain error.”\nThat test requires lower courts to conduct four separate\ninquiries, each of which requires a distinct form of judg\nment and several of which have generated significant\nappellate-court dissensus; the test may also contain an\nexception for “structural errors,” a category we have never\ndefined clearly. With great concision, the Court manages\nto summarize all of these moving parts in about five\npages. Ante, at 3–8.\n  Yet the language of Rule 52(b) is straightforward. It\nstates simply: “A plain error that affects substantial rights\nmay be considered even though it was not brought to the\ncourt’s attention.” This is the mirror image of Rule 52(a),\nwhich instructs courts to disregard any error “that does\nnot affect substantial rights.” The Federal Rules thus set\nforth a unitary standard, which turns on whether the\nerror in question affected substantial rights (either in a\nparticular defendant’s case or in the mine run of compara\nble cases), and they leave it to judges to figure out how\nbest to apply that standard.\n  In our attempt to clarify Rule 52(b), we have, I fear,\nboth muddied the waters and lost sight of the wisdom\nembodied in the Rule’s spare text. Errors come in an\nendless variety of “shapes and sizes.” Ante, at 6. Because\nerror-free trials are so rare, appellate courts must repeat\nedly confront the question whether a trial judge’s mistake\nwas harmless or warrants reversal. They become familiar\nwith particular judges and with the vast panoply of trial\nprocedures, they acquire special expertise in dealing with\nrecurring issues, and their doctrine evolves over time to\nhelp clarify and classify various types of mistakes. These\nare just a few of the reasons why federal appellate courts\nare “allowed a wide measure of discretion in the supervi\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nsion of litigation in their respective circuits.” United\nStates v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 745 (1993) (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). This Court’s ever more intensive efforts to\nrationalize plain-error review may have been born of a\nworthy instinct. But they have trapped the appellate\ncourts in an analytic maze that, I have increasingly come\nto believe, is more liable to frustrate than to facilitate\nsound decisionmaking.\n  The trial error at issue in this case undermined the\ndefendant’s substantial rights by allowing the jury to\nconvict him on the basis of an incorrect belief that lawful\nconduct was unlawful, and it does not take an elaborate\nformula to see that. Because, in my view, the Court of\nAppeals properly exercised its discretion to remedy the\nerror and to order a retrial, I respectfully dissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/146982/", "sha1": "ccf2c01b2ec3618738c4451d4e1c1ad32bc44d4b", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-056", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-24T07:36:17"}
