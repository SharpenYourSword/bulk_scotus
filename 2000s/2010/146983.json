RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE\n\n                     CO. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09–448.      Argued April 26, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nAfter medical problems forced petitioner Hardt to stop working, she\n  filed for long-term disability benefits under her employer’s long-term\n  disability plan. Upon exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\n  sued respondent Reliance, her employer’s disability insurance car\n  rier, alleging that it had violated the Employee Retirement Income\n  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits\n  claim. The District Court denied Reliance summary judgment, find\n  ing that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical infor\n  mation, the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.\n  Though also denying Hardt summary judgment, the court stated that\n  it found “compelling evidence” in the record that she was totally dis\n  abled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor, but concluded that\n  it would be unwise to do so without giving Reliance the chance to ad\n  dress the deficiencies in its approach. The court therefore remanded\n  to Reliance, giving it 30 days to consider all the evidence and to act\n  on Hardt’s application, or else the court would enter judgment in\n  Hardt’s favor. Reliance did as instructed and awarded Hardt bene\n  fits. Hardt then filed a motion under 29 U. S. C. §1132(g)(1), a fee\n  shifting statute that applies in most ERISA lawsuits and provides\n  that “the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney’s fee\n  and costs . . . to either party.” Granting the motion, the District\n  Court applied the Circuit’s framework governing attorney’s fee re\n  quests in ERISA cases, concluding, inter alia, that Hardt had at\n  tained the requisite “prevailing party” status. The Fourth Circuit va\n  cated the fees award, holding that Hardt had failed to establish that\n  she qualified as a “prevailing party” under the rule set forth in Buck\n  hannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health\n2          HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 604, that a fee claimant is a\n    “prevailing party” only if he has obtained an “enforceable judgmen[t]\n    on the merits ” or a “court-ordered consent decre[e]. ” The court rea\n    soned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to\n    award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment\n    on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. A fee claimant need not be a “prevailing party” to be eligible for\n an attorney’s fees award under §1132(g)(1). Interpreting the section\n to require a party to attain that status is contrary to §1132(g)(1)’s\n plain text. The words “prevailing party” do not appear in the provi\n sion. Nor does anything else in §1132(g)(1)’s text purport to limit the\n availability of attorney’s fees to a “prevailing party.” Instead,\n §1132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts “discretion” to award at\n torney’s fees “to either party.” (Emphasis added.) That language\n contrasts sharply with §1132(g)(2), which governs the availability of\n attorney’s fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer con\n tributions to a multiemployer plan. In such cases, only plaintiffs who\n obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan” may seek attorney’s fees.\n §1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two paragraphs makes\n clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the avail\n ability of attorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed to\n include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party” requirement, the\n Fourth Circuit’s decision adding that term of art to the statute more\n closely resembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\n one.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359. Pp. 8–9.\n    2. A court may award fees and costs under §1132(g)(1), as long as\n the fee claimant has achieved “some degree of success on the merits.”\n Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694. The bedrock princi\n ple known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of refer\n ence: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s fees, win or lose, unless a\n statute or contract provides otherwise. E.g., id., at 683–686. This\n Court’s “prevailing party” precedents do not govern here because that\n term of art does not appear in §1132(g)(1). Instead, the Court inter\n prets §1132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that\n deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorney’s fees based\n on other criteria. Ruckelshaus, which considered a statute authoriz\n ing a fees award if the court “determines that such an award is ap\n propriate,” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f), is the principal case in that category.\n Applying that decision’s interpretive approach to 29 U. S. C.\n §1132(g)(1), the Court first looks to “the language of the section,” 463\n U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attor\n ney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to either party.” Ruckelshaus also lays\n down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discre\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion. Because here, as in the statute in Ruckelshaus, Congress failed\n  to indicate clearly that it “meant to abandon historic fee-shifting\n  principles and intuitive notions of fairness,” 463 U. S., at 686, a fees\n  claimant must show “some degree of success on the merits” before a\n  court may award attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1), see id., at 694.\n  Hardt has satisfied that standard. Though she failed to win sum\n  mary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless\n  found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that\n  it was inclined to rule in her favor. She also obtained the remand or\n  der, after which Reliance conducted the court-ordered review, re\n  versed its decision, and awarded the benefits she sought. Accord\n  ingly, the District Court properly exercised its discretion to award\n  Hardt attorney’s fees. Pp. 9–13.\n336 Fed.

S. C. §1001 et seq., “a reasonable\nattorney’s fee and costs” are available “to either party” at\nthe court’s “discretion.” §1132(g)(1). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit has interpreted §1132(g)(1) to re\nquire that a fee claimant be a “prevailing party” before he\nmay seek a fees award. We reject this interpretation as\ncontrary to §1132(g)(1)’s plain text. We hold instead that\na court “in its discretion” may award fees and costs “to\neither party,” ibid., as long as the fee claimant has\nachieved “some degree of success on the merits,” Ruckels\nhaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694 (1983).\n                              I\n   In 2000, while working as an executive assistant to the\npresident of textile manufacturer Dan River, Inc., peti\ntioner Bridget Hardt began experiencing neck and shoul\nder pain. Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Because surgeries on both her\nwrists failed to alleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working\n2       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin January 2003.\n   In August 2003, Hardt sought long-term disability\nbenefits from Dan River’s Group Long-Term Disability\nInsurance Program Plan (Plan). Dan River administers\nthe Plan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reli\nance Standard Life Insurance Company decides whether a\nclaimant qualifies for benefits under the Plan and under\nwrites any benefits awarded. Reliance provisionally ap\nproved Hardt’s claim, telling her that final approval\nhinged on her performance in a functional capacities\nevaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal\ntunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.\n   Hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in\nOctober 2003. The evaluator summarized Hardt’s medical\nhistory, observed her resulting physical limitations, and\nultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount\nof sedentary work. Based on this finding, Reliance con\ncluded that Hardt was not totally disabled within the\nmeaning of the Plan and denied her claim for disability\nbenefits. Hardt filed an administrative appeal. Reliance\nreversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was totally\ndisabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore\nentitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.\n   While her administrative appeal was pending, Hardt\nbegan experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves,\nincluding tingling, pain, and numbness. One of her physi\ncians diagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condi\ntion that increased her pain and decreased her physical\ncapabilities over the ensuing months.\n   Hardt eventually applied to the Social Security Admini\nstration for disability benefits under the Social Security\nAct. Her application included questionnaires completed\nby two of her treating physicians, which described Hardt’s\nsymptoms and stated the doctors’ conclusion that Hardt\ncould not return to full gainful employment because of her\nneuropathy and other ailments. In February 2005, the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSocial Security Administration granted Hardt’s applica\ntion and awarded her disability benefits.\n    About two months later, Reliance told Hardt that her\nPlan benefits would expire at the end of the 24-month\nperiod. Reliance explained that under the Plan’s terms,\nonly individuals who are “totally disabled from all occupa\ntions” were eligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 36a, and adhered to its conclusion that,\nbased on its review of Hardt’s records, Hardt was not\n“totally disabled” as defined by the Plan. Reliance also\ndemanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to offset\nthe disability benefits she had received from the Social\nSecurity Administration. (The Plan contains a provision\ncoordinating benefits with Social Security payments.)\nHardt paid Reliance the offset.\n    Hardt then filed another administrative appeal. She\ngave Reliance all of her medical records, the question\nnaires she had submitted to the Social Security Admini\nstration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her\nphysicians. Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this\nmaterial with another functional capacities evaluation.\nWhen Reliance referred Hardt for the updated evaluation,\nit did not ask the evaluator to review Hardt for neuro\npathic pain, even though it knew that Hardt had been\ndiagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.\n    Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in December\n2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January\n2006. The evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid\nbecause Hardt’s efforts were “submaximal.” Id., at 37a.\nOne evaluator recorded that Hardt “refused multiple tests\n. . . for fear of nausea/illness/further pain complaints.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    Lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation,\nReliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation\ncounselor to help it resolve Hardt’s administrative appeal.\nThe physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he re\n4       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviewed some, but not all, of Hardt’s medical records.\nBased on that review, the physician produced a report in\nwhich he opined that Hardt’s health was expected to\nimprove. His report, however, did not mention Hardt’s\npain medications or the questionnaires that Hardt’s at\ntending physicians had completed as part of her applica\ntion for Social Security benefits. The vocational rehabili\ntation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study\n(based on Hardt’s health in 2003) that identified eight\nemployment opportunities suitable for Hardt. After re\nviewing the physician’s report, the labor market study,\nand the results of the 2003 functional capacities evalua\ntion, Reliance concluded that its decision to terminate\nHardt’s benefits was correct. It advised Hardt of this\ndecision in March 2006.\n   After exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\nsued Reliance in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia. She alleged that Reliance\nviolated ERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long\nterm disability benefits. See §1132(a)(1)(B). The parties\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment, both of which\nthe District Court denied.\n   The court first rejected Reliance’s request for summary\njudgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that\n“Reliance’s decision to deny benefits was based on incom\nplete information.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Most\nprominently, none of the functional capacities evaluations\nto which Hardt had submitted had “assessed the impact of\nneuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms. Hardt.” Ibid. In\naddition, the reviewing physician’s report “was itself\nincomplete”; the basis for the physician’s “medical conclu\nsions [wa]s extremely vague and conclusory,” ibid., and\nthe physician had “failed to cite any medical evidence to\nsupport his conclusions,” id., at 43a, or “to address the\ntreating physicians’ contradictory medical findings,” id., at\n44a. The court also found that Reliance had “improperly\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt submitted,”\nid., at 45a, and had “further ignored the substantial\namount of pain medication Ms. Hardt’s treating physi\ncians had prescribed to her,” id., at 46a. Accordingly, the\ncourt thought it “clear that Reliance’s decision to deny Ms.\nHardt long-term disability benefits was not based on\nsubstantial evidence.” Id., at 47a.\n   The District Court then denied Hardt’s motion for sum\nmary judgment, which contended that Reliance’s decision\nto deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law. In\nso doing, however, the court found “compelling evidence”\nin the record that “Ms. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to\nher neuropathy.” Id., at 48a. Although it was “inclined to\nrule in Ms. Hardt’s favor,” the court concluded that “it\nwould be unwise to take this step without first giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its ap\nproach.” Ibid. In the District Court’s view, a remand to\nReliance was warranted because “[t]his case presents one\nof those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed\nto comply with the ERISA guidelines,” meaning “Ms.\nHardt did not get the kind of review to which she was\nentitled under applicable law.” Ibid. Accordingly, the\ncourt instructed “Reliance to act on Ms. Hardt’s applica\ntion by adequately considering all the evidence” within 30\ndays; “[o]therwise,” it warned, “judgment will be issued in\nfavor of Ms. Hardt.” Id., at 49a.\n   Reliance did as instructed.         After conducting that\nreview, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term dis\nability benefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due\nbenefits.\n   Hardt then moved for attorney’s fees and costs under\n§1132(g)(1). The District Court assessed her motion under\nthe three-step framework that governed fee requests in\nERISA cases under Circuit precedent. At step one of that\nframework, a district court asks whether the fee claimant\nis a “ ‘prevailing party.’ ” Id., at 15a–16a (quoting Martin\n6         HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., 115 F. 3d\n1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citing Buckhannon Board &\nCare Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee\nclaimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds\nto step two and “determin[es] whether an award of attor\nneys’ fees is appropriate” by examining “five factors.”1\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if those five factors\nsuggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court “must\nreview the attorneys’ fees and costs requested and limit\nthem to a reasonable amount.” Id., at 17a (citing Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983)).\n   Applying that framework, the District Court granted\nHardt’s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a pre\nvailing party because the court’s remand order “sanctioned\na material change in the legal relationship of the parties\nby ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to\nwhich [Hardt] was entitled.” Id., at 22a. The court recog\nnized that the order did not “sanctio[n] a certain result on\nremand,” but found that it “quite clearly expressed the\nconsequences to [Reliance] were it to fail to complete its\nreconsideration in an expeditious manner.” Id., at 19a.\nAccordingly, the remand order “signif[ied] that the court\nwas displeased with the cursory review that [Reliance]\nhad initially given to [Hardt’s] claim, but was inclined to\nreserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a\nproper review of all of the medical evidence.” Ibid. The\n\n——————\n  1 These factors are: “ ‘(1) the degree of opposing parties’ culpability or\n\nbad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attor\nneys’ fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys’ fees against the opposing\nparties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;\n(4) whether the parties requesting attorneys’ fees sought to benefit all\nparticipants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a signifi\ncant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits\nof the parties’ positions.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a (quoting Quesin\nberry v. Life Ins. Co. of North Am., 987 F. 2d 1017, 1029 (CA4 1993)).\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one\ninquiry—i.e., she failed to establish that she was a “pre\nvailing party.” In reaching that conclusion, the Court of\nAppeals relied on this Court’s decision in Buckhannon,\nunder which a fee claimant qualifies as a “prevailing\nparty” only if he has obtained an “ ‘enforceable judgmen[t]\non the merits’ ” or a “ ‘court-ordered consent decre[e].’ ” 336\nFed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009) (per curiam) (quoting 532\nU. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that be\ncause the remand order “did not require Reliance to award\nbenefits to Hardt,” it did “not constitute an ‘enforceable\njudgment on the merits’ as Buckhannon requires,” thus\nprecluding Hardt from establishing prevailing party\nstatus. 336 Fed. Appx., at 336 (brackets omitted).\n  Hardt filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking\nreview of two aspects of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.\nFirst, did the Court of Appeals correctly conclude that\n§1132(g)(1) permits courts to award attorney’s fees only to\na “prevailing party”?2 Second, did the Court of Appeals\n——————\n  2 The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue. Some (a few only\n\ntentatively) agree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion here that only\nprevailing parties are entitled to fees under §1132(g)(1). See, e.g.,\nCottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F. 3d 220, 225 (CA1\n1996) (“Congress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a\n‘participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may\nallow a reasonable attorney’s fee’ to the prevailing party” (emphasis\nadded)); Tate v.

Other Courts of Appeals have rejected or dis\navowed that position. See, e.g., Miller v. United Welfare Fund, 72 F. 3d\n1066, 1074 (CA2 1995); Gibbs v. Gibbs, 210 F. 3d 491, 503 (CA5 2000);\nFreeman v. Continental Ins. Co., 996 F. 2d 1116, 1119 (CA11 1993).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

In such cases,\nonly plaintiffs who obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan”\nmay seek attorney’s fees. §1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast\nbetween these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress\nknows how to impose express limits on the availability of\nattorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed\nto include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party”\nlimit on the availability of attorney’s fees, the Court of\nAppeals’ decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting\nstatute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely\nresembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\none.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359\n(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  We see no reason to dwell any longer on this question,\nparticularly given Reliance’s concessions. See Brief for\nRespondent 9–10 (“On its face,” §1132(g)(1) “does not\nexpressly demand, like so many statutes, that a claimant\nbe a ‘prevailing party’ before receiving attorney’s fees”).\nWe therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a “pre\nvailing party” to be eligible for an attorney’s fees award\nunder §1132(g)(1).\n                             III\n   We next consider the circumstances under which a court\nmay award attorney’s fees pursuant to §1132(g)(1). “Our\nbasic point of reference” when considering the award of\nattorney’s fees is the bedrock principle known as the\n“ ‘American Rule’ ”: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s\nfees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides\notherwise. Ruckelshaus, 463 U. S., at 683; see id., at 683–\n686; Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,\n421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975); Buckhannon, supra, at 602–603;\n10        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee also Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 5). Statutory changes to this rule take various\nforms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to\naward attorney’s fees only to a “prevailing party.” 3 Others\npermit a “substantially prevailing” party 4 or a “successful”\nlitigant 5 to obtain fees. Still others authorize district\ncourts to award attorney’s fees where “appropriate,” 6 or\nsimply vest district courts with “discretion” to award fees.7\n   Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule,\nwe have most often considered statutes containing an\nexpress “prevailing party” requirement. See, e.g., Texas\nState Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,\n489 U. S. 782, 792–793 (1989); Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S.\n103, 109–114 (1992); Buckhannon, supra, at 602–606; Sole\nv. Wyner, 551 U. S. 74, 82–86 (2007). Our “prevailing\nparty” precedents, however, do not govern the availability\nof fees awards under §1132(g)(1), because this provision\ndoes not limit the availability of attorney’s fees to the\n“prevailing party.” Supra, at 8–9; see also Gross, supra, at\n___, (slip op., at 6) (cautioning courts “conducting statu\ntory interpretation . . . ‘not to apply rules applicable under\none statute to a different statute without careful and\ncritical examination’ ” (quoting Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 393 (2008))).\n   Instead, we interpret §1132(g)(1) in light of our prece\ndents addressing statutory deviations from the American\nRule that do not limit attorney’s fees awards to the “pre\n——————\n   3 See, e.g., Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v.

S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvailing party.” In that line of precedents, Ruckelshaus is\nthe principal case. There, the Court interpreted §307(f) of\nthe Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees\n“whenever it determines that such an award is appropri\nate.” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f). We began by noting that be\ncause nothing in §307(f)’s text “clear[ly] show[ed]” that\nCongress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S.,\nat 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating\nsuccess to be eligible for a fees award under that section,\nid., at 686. We then concluded that by using the less\nstringent “whenever . . . appropriate” standard instead of\nthe traditional “prevailing party” standard, Congress had\n“expand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards\nfrom prevailing parties to partially prevailing parties—\nparties achieving some success, even if not major success.”\nId., at 688. We thus held “that, absent some degree of\nsuccess on the merits by the claimant, it is not ‘appropri\nate’ for a federal court to award attorney’s fees under\n§307(f).” Id., at 694.\n   Applying the interpretive approach we employed in\nRuckelshaus to §1132(g)(1), we first look to “the language\nof the section,” id., at 682, which unambiguously allows a\ncourt to award attorney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to\neither party,” §1132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with\nsuch broad discretion are well known in the law, particu\nlarly in the attorney’s fees context. See, e.g., n. 7, supra;\nsee also Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   Equally well known, however, is the fact that a “judge’s\ndiscretion is not unlimited.” Ibid. Consistent with Cir\ncuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to\nguide its discretion in deciding whether to award attor\nney’s fees under §1132(g)(1). See supra, at 6, and n. 1.\nBecause these five factors bear no obvious relation to\n§1132(g)(1)’s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they\nare not required for channeling a court’s discretion when\nawarding fees under this section.\n12        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Instead, Ruckelshaus lays down the proper markers to\nguide a court in exercising the discretion that §1132(g)(1)\ngrants. As in the statute at issue in Ruckelshaus, Con\ngress failed to indicate clearly in §1132(g)(1) that it\n“meant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and\nintuitive notions of fairness.” 463 U. S., at 686. Accord\ningly, a fees claimant must show “some degree of success\non the merits” before a court may award attorney’s fees\nunder §1132(g)(1), id., at 694. A claimant does not satisfy\nthat requirement by achieving “trivial success on the\nmerits” or a “purely procedural victor[y],” but does satisfy\nit if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation\nsome success on the merits without conducting a “lengthy\ninquir[y] into the question whether a particular party’s\nsuccess was ‘substantial’ or occurred on a ‘central issue.’ ”\nId., at 688, n. 9.8\n   Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should\ngovern fee requests under §1132(g)(1), see Brief for Re\nspondent 13–31, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.\nSpecifically, Reliance contends that a court order remand\ning an ERISA claim for further consideration can never\nconstitute “some success on the merits,” even if such a\nremand results in an award of benefits. See id., at 34–50.\n   Reliance’s argument misses the point, given the facts of\nthis case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that\n“the plan administrator has failed to comply with the\nERISA guidelines” and “that Ms. Hardt did not get the\nkind of review to which she was entitled under applicable\nlaw.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U. S. C. §1133(2),\n29 CFR §2560.503–1(h) (2009). Although Hardt failed to\nwin summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District\n——————\n  8 We do not foreclose the possibility that once a claimant has satisfied\n\nthis requirement, and thus becomes eligible for a fees award under\n§1132(g)(1), a court may consider the five factors adopted by the Court\nof Appeals, see n. 1, supra, in deciding whether to award attorney’s\nfees.\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)               13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt nevertheless found “compelling evidence that Ms.\nHardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,” and\nstated that it was “inclined to rule in Ms. Hardt’s favor” on\nher benefits claim, but declined to do so before “first giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its”\nstatutorily mandated “full and fair review” of that claim.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; 29 U. S. C. §1133(2). Hardt\nthus obtained a judicial order instructing Reliance “to act\non Ms. Hardt’s application by adequately considering all\nthe evidence” within 30 days; “[o]therwise, judgment will\nbe issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. After Reliance conducted that court-ordered review,\nand consistent with the District Court’s appraisal, Reli\nance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the benefits\nshe sought. App. 120a–123a.\n  These facts establish that Hardt has achieved far more\nthan “trivial success on the merits” or a “purely procedural\nvictory.” Accordingly, she has achieved “some success on\nthe merits,” and the District Court properly exercised its\ndiscretion to award Hardt attorney’s fees in this case.\nBecause these conclusions resolve this case, we need not\ndecide today whether a remand order, without more,\nconstitutes “some success on the merits” sufficient to make\na party eligible for attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1).9\n                        *  *     *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit and remand this case for proceedings con\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n——————\n  9 Reliance has not preserved any separate objection to the reason\n\nableness of the amount of fees awarded.

Argued April 26, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nAfter medical problems forced petitioner Hardt to stop working, she\n  filed for long-term disability benefits under her employer’s long-term\n  disability plan. Upon exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\n  sued respondent Reliance, her employer’s disability insurance car\n  rier, alleging that it had violated the Employee Retirement Income\n  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits\n  claim. The District Court denied Reliance summary judgment, find\n  ing that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical infor\n  mation, the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.\n  Though also denying Hardt summary judgment, the court stated that\n  it found “compelling evidence” in the record that she was totally dis\n  abled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor, but concluded that\n  it would be unwise to do so without giving Reliance the chance to ad\n  dress the deficiencies in its approach. The court therefore remanded\n  to Reliance, giving it 30 days to consider all the evidence and to act\n  on Hardt’s application, or else the court would enter judgment in\n  Hardt’s favor. Reliance did as instructed and awarded Hardt bene\n  fits. Hardt then filed a motion under 29 U. S. C. §1132(g)(1), a fee\n  shifting statute that applies in most ERISA lawsuits and provides\n  that “the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney’s fee\n  and costs . . . to either party.” Granting the motion, the District\n  Court applied the Circuit’s framework governing attorney’s fee re\n  quests in ERISA cases, concluding, inter alia, that Hardt had at\n  tained the requisite “prevailing party” status. The Fourth Circuit va\n  cated the fees award, holding that Hardt had failed to establish that\n  she qualified as a “prevailing party” under the rule set forth in Buck\n  hannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health\n2          HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 604, that a fee claimant is a\n    “prevailing party” only if he has obtained an “enforceable judgmen[t]\n    on the merits ” or a “court-ordered consent decre[e]. ” The court rea\n    soned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to\n    award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment\n    on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. A fee claimant need not be a “prevailing party” to be eligible for\n an attorney’s fees award under §1132(g)(1). Interpreting the section\n to require a party to attain that status is contrary to §1132(g)(1)’s\n plain text. The words “prevailing party” do not appear in the provi\n sion. Nor does anything else in §1132(g)(1)’s text purport to limit the\n availability of attorney’s fees to a “prevailing party.” Instead,\n §1132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts “discretion” to award at\n torney’s fees “to either party.” (Emphasis added.) That language\n contrasts sharply with §1132(g)(2), which governs the availability of\n attorney’s fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer con\n tributions to a multiemployer plan. In such cases, only plaintiffs who\n obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan” may seek attorney’s fees.\n §1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two paragraphs makes\n clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the avail\n ability of attorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed to\n include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party” requirement, the\n Fourth Circuit’s decision adding that term of art to the statute more\n closely resembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\n one.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359. Pp. 8–9.\n    2. A court may award fees and costs under §1132(g)(1), as long as\n the fee claimant has achieved “some degree of success on the merits.”\n Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694. The bedrock princi\n ple known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of refer\n ence: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s fees, win or lose, unless a\n statute or contract provides otherwise. E.g., id., at 683–686. This\n Court’s “prevailing party” precedents do not govern here because that\n term of art does not appear in §1132(g)(1). Instead, the Court inter\n prets §1132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that\n deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorney’s fees based\n on other criteria. Ruckelshaus, which considered a statute authoriz\n ing a fees award if the court “determines that such an award is ap\n propriate,” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f), is the principal case in that category.\n Applying that decision’s interpretive approach to 29 U. S. C.\n §1132(g)(1), the Court first looks to “the language of the section,” 463\n U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attor\n ney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to either party.” Ruckelshaus also lays\n down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discre\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Because here, as in the statute in Ruckelshaus, Congress failed\n  to indicate clearly that it “meant to abandon historic fee-shifting\n  principles and intuitive notions of fairness,” 463 U. S., at 686, a fees\n  claimant must show “some degree of success on the merits” before a\n  court may award attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1), see id., at 694.\n  Hardt has satisfied that standard. Though she failed to win sum\n  mary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless\n  found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that\n  it was inclined to rule in her favor. She also obtained the remand or\n  der, after which Reliance conducted the court-ordered review, re\n  versed its decision, and awarded the benefits she sought.

S. C. §1001 et seq., “a reasonable\nattorney’s fee and costs” are available “to either party” at\nthe court’s “discretion.” §1132(g)(1). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit has interpreted §1132(g)(1) to re\nquire that a fee claimant be a “prevailing party” before he\nmay seek a fees award. We reject this interpretation as\ncontrary to §1132(g)(1)’s plain text.

S. 680, 694 (1983).\n                              I\n   In 2000, while working as an executive assistant to the\npresident of textile manufacturer Dan River, Inc., peti\ntioner Bridget Hardt began experiencing neck and shoul\nder pain. Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Because surgeries on both her\nwrists failed to alleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working\n2       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin January 2003.\n   In August 2003, Hardt sought long-term disability\nbenefits from Dan River’s Group Long-Term Disability\nInsurance Program Plan (Plan). Dan River administers\nthe Plan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reli\nance Standard Life Insurance Company decides whether a\nclaimant qualifies for benefits under the Plan and under\nwrites any benefits awarded. Reliance provisionally ap\nproved Hardt’s claim, telling her that final approval\nhinged on her performance in a functional capacities\nevaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal\ntunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.\n   Hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in\nOctober 2003. The evaluator summarized Hardt’s medical\nhistory, observed her resulting physical limitations, and\nultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount\nof sedentary work. Based on this finding, Reliance con\ncluded that Hardt was not totally disabled within the\nmeaning of the Plan and denied her claim for disability\nbenefits. Hardt filed an administrative appeal. Reliance\nreversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was totally\ndisabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore\nentitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.\n   While her administrative appeal was pending, Hardt\nbegan experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves,\nincluding tingling, pain, and numbness. One of her physi\ncians diagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condi\ntion that increased her pain and decreased her physical\ncapabilities over the ensuing months.\n   Hardt eventually applied to the Social Security Admini\nstration for disability benefits under the Social Security\nAct. Her application included questionnaires completed\nby two of her treating physicians, which described Hardt’s\nsymptoms and stated the doctors’ conclusion that Hardt\ncould not return to full gainful employment because of her\nneuropathy and other ailments. In February 2005, the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSocial Security Administration granted Hardt’s applica\ntion and awarded her disability benefits.\n    About two months later, Reliance told Hardt that her\nPlan benefits would expire at the end of the 24-month\nperiod. Reliance explained that under the Plan’s terms,\nonly individuals who are “totally disabled from all occupa\ntions” were eligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 36a, and adhered to its conclusion that,\nbased on its review of Hardt’s records, Hardt was not\n“totally disabled” as defined by the Plan. Reliance also\ndemanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to offset\nthe disability benefits she had received from the Social\nSecurity Administration. (The Plan contains a provision\ncoordinating benefits with Social Security payments.)\nHardt paid Reliance the offset.\n    Hardt then filed another administrative appeal. She\ngave Reliance all of her medical records, the question\nnaires she had submitted to the Social Security Admini\nstration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her\nphysicians. Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this\nmaterial with another functional capacities evaluation.\nWhen Reliance referred Hardt for the updated evaluation,\nit did not ask the evaluator to review Hardt for neuro\npathic pain, even though it knew that Hardt had been\ndiagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.\n    Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in December\n2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January\n2006. The evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid\nbecause Hardt’s efforts were “submaximal.” Id., at 37a.\nOne evaluator recorded that Hardt “refused multiple tests\n. . . for fear of nausea/illness/further pain complaints.”\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    Lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation,\nReliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation\ncounselor to help it resolve Hardt’s administrative appeal.\nThe physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he re\n4       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviewed some, but not all, of Hardt’s medical records.\nBased on that review, the physician produced a report in\nwhich he opined that Hardt’s health was expected to\nimprove. His report, however, did not mention Hardt’s\npain medications or the questionnaires that Hardt’s at\ntending physicians had completed as part of her applica\ntion for Social Security benefits. The vocational rehabili\ntation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study\n(based on Hardt’s health in 2003) that identified eight\nemployment opportunities suitable for Hardt. After re\nviewing the physician’s report, the labor market study,\nand the results of the 2003 functional capacities evalua\ntion, Reliance concluded that its decision to terminate\nHardt’s benefits was correct. It advised Hardt of this\ndecision in March 2006.\n   After exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\nsued Reliance in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia. She alleged that Reliance\nviolated ERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long\nterm disability benefits. See §1132(a)(1)(B). The parties\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment, both of which\nthe District Court denied.\n   The court first rejected Reliance’s request for summary\njudgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that\n“Reliance’s decision to deny benefits was based on incom\nplete information.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Most\nprominently, none of the functional capacities evaluations\nto which Hardt had submitted had “assessed the impact of\nneuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms. Hardt.” Ibid. In\naddition, the reviewing physician’s report “was itself\nincomplete”; the basis for the physician’s “medical conclu\nsions [wa]s extremely vague and conclusory,” ibid., and\nthe physician had “failed to cite any medical evidence to\nsupport his conclusions,” id., at 43a, or “to address the\ntreating physicians’ contradictory medical findings,” id., at\n44a. The court also found that Reliance had “improperly\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt submitted,”\nid., at 45a, and had “further ignored the substantial\namount of pain medication Ms. Hardt’s treating physi\ncians had prescribed to her,” id., at 46a. Accordingly, the\ncourt thought it “clear that Reliance’s decision to deny Ms.\nHardt long-term disability benefits was not based on\nsubstantial evidence.” Id., at 47a.\n   The District Court then denied Hardt’s motion for sum\nmary judgment, which contended that Reliance’s decision\nto deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law. In\nso doing, however, the court found “compelling evidence”\nin the record that “Ms. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to\nher neuropathy.” Id., at 48a. Although it was “inclined to\nrule in Ms. Hardt’s favor,” the court concluded that “it\nwould be unwise to take this step without first giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its ap\nproach.” Ibid. In the District Court’s view, a remand to\nReliance was warranted because “[t]his case presents one\nof those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed\nto comply with the ERISA guidelines,” meaning “Ms.\nHardt did not get the kind of review to which she was\nentitled under applicable law.” Ibid. Accordingly, the\ncourt instructed “Reliance to act on Ms. Hardt’s applica\ntion by adequately considering all the evidence” within 30\ndays; “[o]therwise,” it warned, “judgment will be issued in\nfavor of Ms. Hardt.” Id., at 49a.\n   Reliance did as instructed.         After conducting that\nreview, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term dis\nability benefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due\nbenefits.\n   Hardt then moved for attorney’s fees and costs under\n§1132(g)(1). The District Court assessed her motion under\nthe three-step framework that governed fee requests in\nERISA cases under Circuit precedent. At step one of that\nframework, a district court asks whether the fee claimant\nis a “ ‘prevailing party.’ ” Id., at 15a–16a (quoting Martin\n6         HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., 115 F. 3d\n1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citing Buckhannon Board &\nCare Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee\nclaimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds\nto step two and “determin[es] whether an award of attor\nneys’ fees is appropriate” by examining “five factors.”1\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if those five factors\nsuggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court “must\nreview the attorneys’ fees and costs requested and limit\nthem to a reasonable amount.” Id., at 17a (citing Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983)).\n   Applying that framework, the District Court granted\nHardt’s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a pre\nvailing party because the court’s remand order “sanctioned\na material change in the legal relationship of the parties\nby ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to\nwhich [Hardt] was entitled.” Id., at 22a. The court recog\nnized that the order did not “sanctio[n] a certain result on\nremand,” but found that it “quite clearly expressed the\nconsequences to [Reliance] were it to fail to complete its\nreconsideration in an expeditious manner.” Id., at 19a.\nAccordingly, the remand order “signif[ied] that the court\nwas displeased with the cursory review that [Reliance]\nhad initially given to [Hardt’s] claim, but was inclined to\nreserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a\nproper review of all of the medical evidence.” Ibid. The\n\n——————\n  1 These factors are: “ ‘(1) the degree of opposing parties’ culpability or\n\nbad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attor\nneys’ fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys’ fees against the opposing\nparties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;\n(4) whether the parties requesting attorneys’ fees sought to benefit all\nparticipants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a signifi\ncant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits\nof the parties’ positions.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a (quoting Quesin\nberry v. Life Ins. Co. of North Am., 987 F. 2d 1017, 1029 (CA4 1993)).\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt next concluded that a fees award was appropriate\nunder the five-factor test, see id., at 22a–25a, and\nawarded $39,149 in fees and costs, id., at 25a–30a.\n  Reliance appealed the fees award, and the Court of\nAppeals vacated the District Court’s order. According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one\ninquiry—i.e., she failed to establish that she was a “pre\nvailing party.” In reaching that conclusion, the Court of\nAppeals relied on this Court’s decision in Buckhannon,\nunder which a fee claimant qualifies as a “prevailing\nparty” only if he has obtained an “ ‘enforceable judgmen[t]\non the merits’ ” or a “ ‘court-ordered consent decre[e].’ ” 336\nFed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009) (per curiam) (quoting 532\nU. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that be\ncause the remand order “did not require Reliance to award\nbenefits to Hardt,” it did “not constitute an ‘enforceable\njudgment on the merits’ as Buckhannon requires,” thus\nprecluding Hardt from establishing prevailing party\nstatus. 336 Fed. Appx., at 336 (brackets omitted).\n  Hardt filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking\nreview of two aspects of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.\nFirst, did the Court of Appeals correctly conclude that\n§1132(g)(1) permits courts to award attorney’s fees only to\na “prevailing party”?2 Second, did the Court of Appeals\n——————\n  2 The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue. Some (a few only\n\ntentatively) agree with the Court of Appeals’ conclusion here that only\nprevailing parties are entitled to fees under §1132(g)(1). See, e.g.,\nCottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F. 3d 220, 225 (CA1\n1996) (“Congress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a\n‘participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may\nallow a reasonable attorney’s fee’ to the prevailing party” (emphasis\nadded)); Tate v. Long Term Disability Plan for Salaried Employees of\nChampion Int’l Corp. #506, 545 F. 3d 555, 564 (CA7 2008) (“In analyz\ning whether attorney’s fees should be awarded to a ‘prevailing party’ in\nan ERISA case, a court should consider whether the losing party’s\nposition was justified an taken in good faith. However, we have held\nthat a claimant who is awarded a remand in an ERISA case generally\n8         HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncorrectly identify the circumstances under which a fee\nclaimant is entitled to attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1)?\nWe granted certiorari. 558 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II\n  Whether §1132(g)(1) limits the availability of attorney’s\nfees to a “prevailing party” is a question of statutory con\nstruction. As in all such cases, we begin by analyzing the\nstatutory language, “assum[ing] that the ordinary mean\ning of that language accurately expresses the legislative\npurpose.” Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We must enforce plain and unambiguous statu\ntory language according to its terms. Carcieri v. Salazar,\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7); Jimenez v. Quar\nterman, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5).\n  Section 1132(g)(1) provides:\n     “In any action under this subchapter (other than an\n     action described in paragraph (2)) by a participant,\n     beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion\n     may allow a reasonable attorney’s fee and costs of ac\n     tion to either party.”\nThe words “prevailing party” do not appear in this provi\nsion. Nor does anything else in §1132(g)(1)’s text purport\nto limit the availability of attorney’s fees to a “prevailing\nparty.” Instead, §1132(g)(1) expressly grants district\ncourts “discretion” to award attorney’s fees “to either\n——————\nis not a prevailing party in the truest sense of the term” (some internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)); Graham v. Hartford Life and\nAccident Ins. Co., 501 F. 3d 1153, 1162 (CA10 2007) (“We also afford\ncertain weight to prevailing party status, even though we acknowledge\nthat the ERISA attorney’s fees provision is not expressly directed at\nprevailing parties”). Other Courts of Appeals have rejected or dis\navowed that position. See, e.g., Miller v. United Welfare Fund, 72 F. 3d\n1066, 1074 (CA2 1995); Gibbs v. Gibbs, 210 F. 3d 491, 503 (CA5 2000);\nFreeman v. Continental Ins. Co., 996 F. 2d 1116, 1119 (CA11 1993).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparty.” (Emphasis added.)\n  That language contrasts sharply with §1132(g)(2), which\ngoverns the availability of attorney’s fees in ERISA actions\nunder §1145 (actions to recover delinquent employer\ncontributions to a multiemployer plan). In such cases,\nonly plaintiffs who obtain “a judgment in favor of the plan”\nmay seek attorney’s fees. §1132(g)(2)(D). The contrast\nbetween these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress\nknows how to impose express limits on the availability of\nattorney’s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed\nto include in §1132(g)(1) an express “prevailing party”\nlimit on the availability of attorney’s fees, the Court of\nAppeals’ decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting\nstatute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely\nresembles “invent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\none.” Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359\n(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  We see no reason to dwell any longer on this question,\nparticularly given Reliance’s concessions. See Brief for\nRespondent 9–10 (“On its face,” §1132(g)(1) “does not\nexpressly demand, like so many statutes, that a claimant\nbe a ‘prevailing party’ before receiving attorney’s fees”).\nWe therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a “pre\nvailing party” to be eligible for an attorney’s fees award\nunder §1132(g)(1).\n                             III\n   We next consider the circumstances under which a court\nmay award attorney’s fees pursuant to §1132(g)(1). “Our\nbasic point of reference” when considering the award of\nattorney’s fees is the bedrock principle known as the\n“ ‘American Rule’ ”: Each litigant pays his own attorney’s\nfees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides\notherwise. Ruckelshaus, 463 U. S., at 683; see id., at 683–\n686; Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,\n421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975); Buckhannon, supra, at 602–603;\n10        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee also Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 5). Statutory changes to this rule take various\nforms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to\naward attorney’s fees only to a “prevailing party.” 3 Others\npermit a “substantially prevailing” party 4 or a “successful”\nlitigant 5 to obtain fees. Still others authorize district\ncourts to award attorney’s fees where “appropriate,” 6 or\nsimply vest district courts with “discretion” to award fees.7\n   Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule,\nwe have most often considered statutes containing an\nexpress “prevailing party” requirement. See, e.g., Texas\nState Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,\n489 U. S. 782, 792–793 (1989); Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S.\n103, 109–114 (1992); Buckhannon, supra, at 602–606; Sole\nv. Wyner, 551 U. S. 74, 82–86 (2007). Our “prevailing\nparty” precedents, however, do not govern the availability\nof fees awards under §1132(g)(1), because this provision\ndoes not limit the availability of attorney’s fees to the\n“prevailing party.” Supra, at 8–9; see also Gross, supra, at\n___, (slip op., at 6) (cautioning courts “conducting statu\ntory interpretation . . . ‘not to apply rules applicable under\none statute to a different statute without careful and\ncritical examination’ ” (quoting Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 393 (2008))).\n   Instead, we interpret §1132(g)(1) in light of our prece\ndents addressing statutory deviations from the American\nRule that do not limit attorney’s fees awards to the “pre\n——————\n   3 See, e.g., Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v.

S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvailing party.” In that line of precedents, Ruckelshaus is\nthe principal case. There, the Court interpreted §307(f) of\nthe Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees\n“whenever it determines that such an award is appropri\nate.” 42 U. S. C. §7607(f). We began by noting that be\ncause nothing in §307(f)’s text “clear[ly] show[ed]” that\nCongress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S.,\nat 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating\nsuccess to be eligible for a fees award under that section,\nid., at 686. We then concluded that by using the less\nstringent “whenever . . . appropriate” standard instead of\nthe traditional “prevailing party” standard, Congress had\n“expand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards\nfrom prevailing parties to partially prevailing parties—\nparties achieving some success, even if not major success.”\nId., at 688. We thus held “that, absent some degree of\nsuccess on the merits by the claimant, it is not ‘appropri\nate’ for a federal court to award attorney’s fees under\n§307(f).” Id., at 694.\n   Applying the interpretive approach we employed in\nRuckelshaus to §1132(g)(1), we first look to “the language\nof the section,” id., at 682, which unambiguously allows a\ncourt to award attorney’s fees “in its discretion . . . to\neither party,” §1132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with\nsuch broad discretion are well known in the law, particu\nlarly in the attorney’s fees context. See, e.g., n. 7, supra;\nsee also Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   Equally well known, however, is the fact that a “judge’s\ndiscretion is not unlimited.” Ibid. Consistent with Cir\ncuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to\nguide its discretion in deciding whether to award attor\nney’s fees under §1132(g)(1). See supra, at 6, and n. 1.\nBecause these five factors bear no obvious relation to\n§1132(g)(1)’s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they\nare not required for channeling a court’s discretion when\nawarding fees under this section.\n12        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Instead, Ruckelshaus lays down the proper markers to\nguide a court in exercising the discretion that §1132(g)(1)\ngrants. As in the statute at issue in Ruckelshaus, Con\ngress failed to indicate clearly in §1132(g)(1) that it\n“meant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and\nintuitive notions of fairness.” 463 U. S., at 686. Accord\ningly, a fees claimant must show “some degree of success\non the merits” before a court may award attorney’s fees\nunder §1132(g)(1), id., at 694. A claimant does not satisfy\nthat requirement by achieving “trivial success on the\nmerits” or a “purely procedural victor[y],” but does satisfy\nit if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation\nsome success on the merits without conducting a “lengthy\ninquir[y] into the question whether a particular party’s\nsuccess was ‘substantial’ or occurred on a ‘central issue.’ ”\nId., at 688, n. 9.8\n   Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should\ngovern fee requests under §1132(g)(1), see Brief for Re\nspondent 13–31, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.\nSpecifically, Reliance contends that a court order remand\ning an ERISA claim for further consideration can never\nconstitute “some success on the merits,” even if such a\nremand results in an award of benefits. See id., at 34–50.\n   Reliance’s argument misses the point, given the facts of\nthis case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that\n“the plan administrator has failed to comply with the\nERISA guidelines” and “that Ms. Hardt did not get the\nkind of review to which she was entitled under applicable\nlaw.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U. S. C. §1133(2),\n29 CFR §2560.503–1(h) (2009). Although Hardt failed to\nwin summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District\n——————\n  8 We do not foreclose the possibility that once a claimant has satisfied\n\nthis requirement, and thus becomes eligible for a fees award under\n§1132(g)(1), a court may consider the five factors adopted by the Court\nof Appeals, see n. 1, supra, in deciding whether to award attorney’s\nfees.\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)               13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt nevertheless found “compelling evidence that Ms.\nHardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,” and\nstated that it was “inclined to rule in Ms. Hardt’s favor” on\nher benefits claim, but declined to do so before “first giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its”\nstatutorily mandated “full and fair review” of that claim.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; 29 U. S. C. §1133(2). Hardt\nthus obtained a judicial order instructing Reliance “to act\non Ms. Hardt’s application by adequately considering all\nthe evidence” within 30 days; “[o]therwise, judgment will\nbe issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. After Reliance conducted that court-ordered review,\nand consistent with the District Court’s appraisal, Reli\nance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the benefits\nshe sought. App. 120a–123a.\n  These facts establish that Hardt has achieved far more\nthan “trivial success on the merits” or a “purely procedural\nvictory.” Accordingly, she has achieved “some success on\nthe merits,” and the District Court properly exercised its\ndiscretion to award Hardt attorney’s fees in this case.\nBecause these conclusions resolve this case, we need not\ndecide today whether a remand order, without more,\nconstitutes “some success on the merits” sufficient to make\na party eligible for attorney’s fees under §1132(g)(1).9\n                        *  *     *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit and remand this case for proceedings con\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n——————\n  9 Reliance has not preserved any separate objection to the reason\n\nableness of the amount of fees awarded.

RELIANCE \n\n     STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [May 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in\nthe judgment.\n   While I join the Court’s judgment and Parts I and II of\nits opinion, I do not believe that our mistaken interpreta\ntion of §307(f) of the Clean Air Act in Ruckelshaus v. Si\nerra Club, 463 U. S. 680 (1983), should be given any spe\ncial weight in the interpretation of this—or any other—\ndifferent statutory provision. The outcome in that closely\ndivided case turned, to a significant extent, on a judgment\nabout how to read the legislative history of the provision\nin question. Compare id., at 686–693, with id., at 703–706\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). I agree with the Court in this\ncase that 29 U. S. C. §1132(g)(1) does not impose a “pre\nvailing party” requirement; I agree, further, that the\nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion in awarding\nattorney’s fees to this petitioner. But I would examine the\ntext, structure, and history of any other federal statute\nauthorizing an award of fees before concluding that Con\ngress intended the same approach under that statute as\nunder this one.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/146983/", "sha1": "5c206980b22576d90e158ecbc3bb51d62d8d8e2d", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-055", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-24T07:36:18"}
