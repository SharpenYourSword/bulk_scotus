RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INSURANCE\n\n                     CO. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u2013448.      Argued April 26, 2010\u2014Decided May 24, 2010\nAfter medical problems forced petitioner Hardt to stop working, she\n  filed for long-term disability benefits under her employer\u2019s long-term\n  disability plan. Upon exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\n  sued respondent Reliance, her employer\u2019s disability insurance car\n  rier, alleging that it had violated the Employee Retirement Income\n  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits\n  claim. The District Court denied Reliance summary judgment, find\n  ing that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical infor\n  mation, the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.\n  Though also denying Hardt summary judgment, the court stated that\n  it found \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d in the record that she was totally dis\n  abled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor, but concluded that\n  it would be unwise to do so without giving Reliance the chance to ad\n  dress the deficiencies in its approach. The court therefore remanded\n  to Reliance, giving it 30 days to consider all the evidence and to act\n  on Hardt\u2019s application, or else the court would enter judgment in\n  Hardt\u2019s favor. Reliance did as instructed and awarded Hardt bene\n  fits. Hardt then filed a motion under 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(g)(1), a fee\n  shifting statute that applies in most ERISA lawsuits and provides\n  that \u201cthe court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\n  and costs . . . to either party.\u201d Granting the motion, the District\n  Court applied the Circuit\u2019s framework governing attorney\u2019s fee re\n  quests in ERISA cases, concluding, inter alia, that Hardt had at\n  tained the requisite \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. The Fourth Circuit va\n  cated the fees award, holding that Hardt had failed to establish that\n  she qualified as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the rule set forth in Buck\n  hannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health\n2          HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 604, that a fee claimant is a\n    \u201cprevailing party\u201d only if he has obtained an \u201cenforceable judgmen[t]\n    on the merits \u201d or a \u201ccourt-ordered consent decre[e]. \u201d The court rea\n    soned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to\n    award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment\n    on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. A fee claimant need not be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to be eligible for\n an attorney\u2019s fees award under \u00a71132(g)(1). Interpreting the section\n to require a party to attain that status is contrary to \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s\n plain text. The words \u201cprevailing party\u201d do not appear in the provi\n sion. Nor does anything else in \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text purport to limit the\n availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Instead,\n \u00a71132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award at\n torney\u2019s fees \u201cto either party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That language\n contrasts sharply with \u00a71132(g)(2), which governs the availability of\n attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer con\n tributions to a multiemployer plan. In such cases, only plaintiffs who\n obtain \u201ca judgment in favor of the plan\u201d may seek attorney\u2019s fees.\n \u00a71132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two paragraphs makes\n clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the avail\n ability of attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed to\n include in \u00a71132(g)(1) an express \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement, the\n Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision adding that term of art to the statute more\n closely resembles \u201cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\n one.\u201d Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359. Pp. 8\u20139.\n    2. A court may award fees and costs under \u00a71132(g)(1), as long as\n the fee claimant has achieved \u201csome degree of success on the merits.\u201d\n Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694. The bedrock princi\n ple known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of refer\n ence: Each litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose, unless a\n statute or contract provides otherwise. E.g., id., at 683\u2013686. This\n Court\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d precedents do not govern here because that\n term of art does not appear in \u00a71132(g)(1). Instead, the Court inter\n prets \u00a71132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that\n deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorney\u2019s fees based\n on other criteria. Ruckelshaus, which considered a statute authoriz\n ing a fees award if the court \u201cdetermines that such an award is ap\n propriate,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(f), is the principal case in that category.\n Applying that decision\u2019s interpretive approach to 29 U. S. C.\n \u00a71132(g)(1), the Court first looks to \u201cthe language of the section,\u201d 463\n U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attor\n ney\u2019s fees \u201cin its discretion . . . to either party.\u201d Ruckelshaus also lays\n down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discre\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion. Because here, as in the statute in Ruckelshaus, Congress failed\n  to indicate clearly that it \u201cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting\n  principles and intuitive notions of fairness,\u201d 463 U. S., at 686, a fees\n  claimant must show \u201csome degree of success on the merits\u201d before a\n  court may award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71132(g)(1), see id., at 694.\n  Hardt has satisfied that standard. Though she failed to win sum\n  mary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless\n  found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that\n  it was inclined to rule in her favor. She also obtained the remand or\n  der, after which Reliance conducted the court-ordered review, re\n  versed its decision, and awarded the benefits she sought. Accord\n  ingly, the District Court properly exercised its discretion to award\n  Hardt attorney\u2019s fees. Pp. 9\u201313.\n336 Fed.

S. C. \u00a71001 et seq., \u201ca reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fee and costs\u201d are available \u201cto either party\u201d at\nthe court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion.\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1). The Court of Appeals\nfor the Fourth Circuit has interpreted \u00a71132(g)(1) to re\nquire that a fee claimant be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d before he\nmay seek a fees award. We reject this interpretation as\ncontrary to \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s plain text. We hold instead that\na court \u201cin its discretion\u201d may award fees and costs \u201cto\neither party,\u201d ibid., as long as the fee claimant has\nachieved \u201csome degree of success on the merits,\u201d Ruckels\nhaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694 (1983).\n                              I\n   In 2000, while working as an executive assistant to the\npresident of textile manufacturer Dan River, Inc., peti\ntioner Bridget Hardt began experiencing neck and shoul\nder pain. Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Because surgeries on both her\nwrists failed to alleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working\n2       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin January 2003.\n   In August 2003, Hardt sought long-term disability\nbenefits from Dan River\u2019s Group Long-Term Disability\nInsurance Program Plan (Plan). Dan River administers\nthe Plan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reli\nance Standard Life Insurance Company decides whether a\nclaimant qualifies for benefits under the Plan and under\nwrites any benefits awarded. Reliance provisionally ap\nproved Hardt\u2019s claim, telling her that final approval\nhinged on her performance in a functional capacities\nevaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal\ntunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.\n   Hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in\nOctober 2003. The evaluator summarized Hardt\u2019s medical\nhistory, observed her resulting physical limitations, and\nultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount\nof sedentary work. Based on this finding, Reliance con\ncluded that Hardt was not totally disabled within the\nmeaning of the Plan and denied her claim for disability\nbenefits. Hardt filed an administrative appeal. Reliance\nreversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was totally\ndisabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore\nentitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.\n   While her administrative appeal was pending, Hardt\nbegan experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves,\nincluding tingling, pain, and numbness. One of her physi\ncians diagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condi\ntion that increased her pain and decreased her physical\ncapabilities over the ensuing months.\n   Hardt eventually applied to the Social Security Admini\nstration for disability benefits under the Social Security\nAct. Her application included questionnaires completed\nby two of her treating physicians, which described Hardt\u2019s\nsymptoms and stated the doctors\u2019 conclusion that Hardt\ncould not return to full gainful employment because of her\nneuropathy and other ailments. In February 2005, the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSocial Security Administration granted Hardt\u2019s applica\ntion and awarded her disability benefits.\n    About two months later, Reliance told Hardt that her\nPlan benefits would expire at the end of the 24-month\nperiod. Reliance explained that under the Plan\u2019s terms,\nonly individuals who are \u201ctotally disabled from all occupa\ntions\u201d were eligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 36a, and adhered to its conclusion that,\nbased on its review of Hardt\u2019s records, Hardt was not\n\u201ctotally disabled\u201d as defined by the Plan. Reliance also\ndemanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to offset\nthe disability benefits she had received from the Social\nSecurity Administration. (The Plan contains a provision\ncoordinating benefits with Social Security payments.)\nHardt paid Reliance the offset.\n    Hardt then filed another administrative appeal. She\ngave Reliance all of her medical records, the question\nnaires she had submitted to the Social Security Admini\nstration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her\nphysicians. Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this\nmaterial with another functional capacities evaluation.\nWhen Reliance referred Hardt for the updated evaluation,\nit did not ask the evaluator to review Hardt for neuro\npathic pain, even though it knew that Hardt had been\ndiagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.\n    Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in December\n2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January\n2006. The evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid\nbecause Hardt\u2019s efforts were \u201csubmaximal.\u201d Id., at 37a.\nOne evaluator recorded that Hardt \u201crefused multiple tests\n. . . for fear of nausea/illness/further pain complaints.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    Lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation,\nReliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation\ncounselor to help it resolve Hardt\u2019s administrative appeal.\nThe physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he re\n4       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviewed some, but not all, of Hardt\u2019s medical records.\nBased on that review, the physician produced a report in\nwhich he opined that Hardt\u2019s health was expected to\nimprove. His report, however, did not mention Hardt\u2019s\npain medications or the questionnaires that Hardt\u2019s at\ntending physicians had completed as part of her applica\ntion for Social Security benefits. The vocational rehabili\ntation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study\n(based on Hardt\u2019s health in 2003) that identified eight\nemployment opportunities suitable for Hardt. After re\nviewing the physician\u2019s report, the labor market study,\nand the results of the 2003 functional capacities evalua\ntion, Reliance concluded that its decision to terminate\nHardt\u2019s benefits was correct. It advised Hardt of this\ndecision in March 2006.\n   After exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\nsued Reliance in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia. She alleged that Reliance\nviolated ERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long\nterm disability benefits. See \u00a71132(a)(1)(B). The parties\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment, both of which\nthe District Court denied.\n   The court first rejected Reliance\u2019s request for summary\njudgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that\n\u201cReliance\u2019s decision to deny benefits was based on incom\nplete information.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Most\nprominently, none of the functional capacities evaluations\nto which Hardt had submitted had \u201cassessed the impact of\nneuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms. Hardt.\u201d Ibid. In\naddition, the reviewing physician\u2019s report \u201cwas itself\nincomplete\u201d; the basis for the physician\u2019s \u201cmedical conclu\nsions [wa]s extremely vague and conclusory,\u201d ibid., and\nthe physician had \u201cfailed to cite any medical evidence to\nsupport his conclusions,\u201d id., at 43a, or \u201cto address the\ntreating physicians\u2019 contradictory medical findings,\u201d id., at\n44a. The court also found that Reliance had \u201cimproperly\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt submitted,\u201d\nid., at 45a, and had \u201cfurther ignored the substantial\namount of pain medication Ms. Hardt\u2019s treating physi\ncians had prescribed to her,\u201d id., at 46a. Accordingly, the\ncourt thought it \u201cclear that Reliance\u2019s decision to deny Ms.\nHardt long-term disability benefits was not based on\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Id., at 47a.\n   The District Court then denied Hardt\u2019s motion for sum\nmary judgment, which contended that Reliance\u2019s decision\nto deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law. In\nso doing, however, the court found \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d\nin the record that \u201cMs. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to\nher neuropathy.\u201d Id., at 48a. Although it was \u201cinclined to\nrule in Ms. Hardt\u2019s favor,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cit\nwould be unwise to take this step without first giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its ap\nproach.\u201d Ibid. In the District Court\u2019s view, a remand to\nReliance was warranted because \u201c[t]his case presents one\nof those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed\nto comply with the ERISA guidelines,\u201d meaning \u201cMs.\nHardt did not get the kind of review to which she was\nentitled under applicable law.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, the\ncourt instructed \u201cReliance to act on Ms. Hardt\u2019s applica\ntion by adequately considering all the evidence\u201d within 30\ndays; \u201c[o]therwise,\u201d it warned, \u201cjudgment will be issued in\nfavor of Ms. Hardt.\u201d Id., at 49a.\n   Reliance did as instructed.         After conducting that\nreview, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term dis\nability benefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due\nbenefits.\n   Hardt then moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under\n\u00a71132(g)(1). The District Court assessed her motion under\nthe three-step framework that governed fee requests in\nERISA cases under Circuit precedent. At step one of that\nframework, a district court asks whether the fee claimant\nis a \u201c \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 15a\u201316a (quoting Martin\n6         HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nv. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, Inc., 115 F. 3d\n1201, 1210 (CA4 1997), and citing Buckhannon Board &\nCare Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and\nHuman Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee\nclaimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds\nto step two and \u201cdetermin[es] whether an award of attor\nneys\u2019 fees is appropriate\u201d by examining \u201cfive factors.\u201d1\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if those five factors\nsuggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court \u201cmust\nreview the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs requested and limit\nthem to a reasonable amount.\u201d Id., at 17a (citing Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983)).\n   Applying that framework, the District Court granted\nHardt\u2019s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a pre\nvailing party because the court\u2019s remand order \u201csanctioned\na material change in the legal relationship of the parties\nby ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to\nwhich [Hardt] was entitled.\u201d Id., at 22a. The court recog\nnized that the order did not \u201csanctio[n] a certain result on\nremand,\u201d but found that it \u201cquite clearly expressed the\nconsequences to [Reliance] were it to fail to complete its\nreconsideration in an expeditious manner.\u201d Id., at 19a.\nAccordingly, the remand order \u201csignif[ied] that the court\nwas displeased with the cursory review that [Reliance]\nhad initially given to [Hardt\u2019s] claim, but was inclined to\nreserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a\nproper review of all of the medical evidence.\u201d Ibid. The\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 These factors are: \u201c \u2018(1) the degree of opposing parties\u2019 culpability or\n\nbad faith; (2) ability of opposing parties to satisfy an award of attor\nneys\u2019 fees; (3) whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the opposing\nparties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;\n(4) whether the parties requesting attorneys\u2019 fees sought to benefit all\nparticipants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a signifi\ncant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits\nof the parties\u2019 positions.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a (quoting Quesin\nberry v.

According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one\ninquiry\u2014i.e., she failed to establish that she was a \u201cpre\nvailing party.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the Court of\nAppeals relied on this Court\u2019s decision in Buckhannon,\nunder which a fee claimant qualifies as a \u201cprevailing\nparty\u201d only if he has obtained an \u201c \u2018enforceable judgmen[t]\non the merits\u2019 \u201d or a \u201c \u2018court-ordered consent decre[e].\u2019 \u201d 336\nFed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009) (per curiam) (quoting 532\nU. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that be\ncause the remand order \u201cdid not require Reliance to award\nbenefits to Hardt,\u201d it did \u201cnot constitute an \u2018enforceable\njudgment on the merits\u2019 as Buckhannon requires,\u201d thus\nprecluding Hardt from establishing prevailing party\nstatus. 336 Fed. Appx., at 336 (brackets omitted).\n  Hardt filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking\nreview of two aspects of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.\nFirst, did the Court of Appeals correctly conclude that\n\u00a71132(g)(1) permits courts to award attorney\u2019s fees only to\na \u201cprevailing party\u201d?2 Second, did the Court of Appeals\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue. Some (a few only\n\ntentatively) agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion here that only\nprevailing parties are entitled to fees under \u00a71132(g)(1). See, e.g.,\nCottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F. 3d 220, 225 (CA1\n1996) (\u201cCongress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a\n\u2018participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may\nallow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 to the prevailing party\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); Tate v.

However, we have held\nthat a claimant who is awarded a remand in an ERISA case generally\n8         HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS.

As in all such cases, we begin by analyzing the\nstatutory language, \u201cassum[ing] that the ordinary mean\ning of that language accurately expresses the legislative\npurpose.\u201d Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We must enforce plain and unambiguous statu\ntory language according to its terms. Carcieri v. Salazar,\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 7); Jimenez v. Quar\nterman, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5).\n  Section 1132(g)(1) provides:\n     \u201cIn any action under this subchapter (other than an\n     action described in paragraph (2)) by a participant,\n     beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion\n     may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of ac\n     tion to either party.\u201d\nThe words \u201cprevailing party\u201d do not appear in this provi\nsion. Nor does anything else in \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text purport\nto limit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing\nparty.\u201d Instead, \u00a71132(g)(1) expressly grants district\ncourts \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cto either\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nis not a prevailing party in the truest sense of the term\u201d (some internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)); Graham v. Hartford Life and\nAccident Ins. Co., 501 F. 3d 1153, 1162 (CA10 2007) (\u201cWe also afford\ncertain weight to prevailing party status, even though we acknowledge\nthat the ERISA attorney\u2019s fees provision is not expressly directed at\nprevailing parties\u201d). Other Courts of Appeals have rejected or dis\navowed that position. See, e.g., Miller v. United Welfare Fund, 72 F. 3d\n1066, 1074 (CA2 1995); Gibbs v. Gibbs, 210 F. 3d 491, 503 (CA5 2000);\nFreeman v. Continental Ins. Co., 996 F. 2d 1116, 1119 (CA11 1993).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n  That language contrasts sharply with \u00a71132(g)(2), which\ngoverns the availability of attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA actions\nunder \u00a71145 (actions to recover delinquent employer\ncontributions to a multiemployer plan). In such cases,\nonly plaintiffs who obtain \u201ca judgment in favor of the plan\u201d\nmay seek attorney\u2019s fees. \u00a71132(g)(2)(D). The contrast\nbetween these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress\nknows how to impose express limits on the availability of\nattorney\u2019s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed\nto include in \u00a71132(g)(1) an express \u201cprevailing party\u201d\nlimit on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees, the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting\nstatute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely\nresembles \u201cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\none.\u201d Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359\n(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  We see no reason to dwell any longer on this question,\nparticularly given Reliance\u2019s concessions. See Brief for\nRespondent 9\u201310 (\u201cOn its face,\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1) \u201cdoes not\nexpressly demand, like so many statutes, that a claimant\nbe a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 before receiving attorney\u2019s fees\u201d).\nWe therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a \u201cpre\nvailing party\u201d to be eligible for an attorney\u2019s fees award\nunder \u00a71132(g)(1).\n                             III\n   We next consider the circumstances under which a court\nmay award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a71132(g)(1). \u201cOur\nbasic point of reference\u201d when considering the award of\nattorney\u2019s fees is the bedrock principle known as the\n\u201c \u2018American Rule\u2019 \u201d: Each litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s\nfees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides\notherwise. Ruckelshaus, 463 U. S., at 683; see id., at 683\u2013\n686; Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,\n421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975); Buckhannon, supra, at 602\u2013603;\n10        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee also Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 5). Statutory changes to this rule take various\nforms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to\naward attorney\u2019s fees only to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d 3 Others\npermit a \u201csubstantially prevailing\u201d party 4 or a \u201csuccessful\u201d\nlitigant 5 to obtain fees. Still others authorize district\ncourts to award attorney\u2019s fees where \u201cappropriate,\u201d 6 or\nsimply vest district courts with \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award fees.7\n   Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule,\nwe have most often considered statutes containing an\nexpress \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement. See, e.g., Texas\nState Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,\n489 U. S. 782, 792\u2013793 (1989); Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S.\n103, 109\u2013114 (1992); Buckhannon, supra, at 602\u2013606; Sole\nv. Wyner, 551 U. S. 74, 82\u201386 (2007). Our \u201cprevailing\nparty\u201d precedents, however, do not govern the availability\nof fees awards under \u00a71132(g)(1), because this provision\ndoes not limit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to the\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201d Supra, at 8\u20139; see also Gross, supra, at\n___, (slip op., at 6) (cautioning courts \u201cconducting statu\ntory interpretation . . . \u2018not to apply rules applicable under\none statute to a different statute without careful and\ncritical examination\u2019 \u201d (quoting Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 393 (2008))).\n   Instead, we interpret \u00a71132(g)(1) in light of our prece\ndents addressing statutory deviations from the American\nRule that do not limit attorney\u2019s fees awards to the \u201cpre\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 See, e.g., Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v.

S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvailing party.\u201d In that line of precedents, Ruckelshaus is\nthe principal case. There, the Court interpreted \u00a7307(f) of\nthe Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees\n\u201cwhenever it determines that such an award is appropri\nate.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(f). We began by noting that be\ncause nothing in \u00a7307(f)\u2019s text \u201cclear[ly] show[ed]\u201d that\nCongress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S.,\nat 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating\nsuccess to be eligible for a fees award under that section,\nid., at 686. We then concluded that by using the less\nstringent \u201cwhenever . . . appropriate\u201d standard instead of\nthe traditional \u201cprevailing party\u201d standard, Congress had\n\u201cexpand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards\nfrom prevailing parties to partially prevailing parties\u2014\nparties achieving some success, even if not major success.\u201d\nId., at 688. We thus held \u201cthat, absent some degree of\nsuccess on the merits by the claimant, it is not \u2018appropri\nate\u2019 for a federal court to award attorney\u2019s fees under\n\u00a7307(f).\u201d Id., at 694.\n   Applying the interpretive approach we employed in\nRuckelshaus to \u00a71132(g)(1), we first look to \u201cthe language\nof the section,\u201d id., at 682, which unambiguously allows a\ncourt to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin its discretion . . . to\neither party,\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with\nsuch broad discretion are well known in the law, particu\nlarly in the attorney\u2019s fees context. See, e.g., n. 7, supra;\nsee also Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   Equally well known, however, is the fact that a \u201cjudge\u2019s\ndiscretion is not unlimited.\u201d Ibid. Consistent with Cir\ncuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to\nguide its discretion in deciding whether to award attor\nney\u2019s fees under \u00a71132(g)(1). See supra, at 6, and n. 1.\nBecause these five factors bear no obvious relation to\n\u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they\nare not required for channeling a court\u2019s discretion when\nawarding fees under this section.\n12        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Instead, Ruckelshaus lays down the proper markers to\nguide a court in exercising the discretion that \u00a71132(g)(1)\ngrants. As in the statute at issue in Ruckelshaus, Con\ngress failed to indicate clearly in \u00a71132(g)(1) that it\n\u201cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and\nintuitive notions of fairness.\u201d 463 U. S., at 686. Accord\ningly, a fees claimant must show \u201csome degree of success\non the merits\u201d before a court may award attorney\u2019s fees\nunder \u00a71132(g)(1), id., at 694. A claimant does not satisfy\nthat requirement by achieving \u201ctrivial success on the\nmerits\u201d or a \u201cpurely procedural victor[y],\u201d but does satisfy\nit if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation\nsome success on the merits without conducting a \u201clengthy\ninquir[y] into the question whether a particular party\u2019s\nsuccess was \u2018substantial\u2019 or occurred on a \u2018central issue.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 688, n. 9.8\n   Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should\ngovern fee requests under \u00a71132(g)(1), see Brief for Re\nspondent 13\u201331, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.\nSpecifically, Reliance contends that a court order remand\ning an ERISA claim for further consideration can never\nconstitute \u201csome success on the merits,\u201d even if such a\nremand results in an award of benefits. See id., at 34\u201350.\n   Reliance\u2019s argument misses the point, given the facts of\nthis case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that\n\u201cthe plan administrator has failed to comply with the\nERISA guidelines\u201d and \u201cthat Ms. Hardt did not get the\nkind of review to which she was entitled under applicable\nlaw.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U. S. C. \u00a71133(2),\n29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131(h) (2009). Although Hardt failed to\nwin summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We do not foreclose the possibility that once a claimant has satisfied\n\nthis requirement, and thus becomes eligible for a fees award under\n\u00a71132(g)(1), a court may consider the five factors adopted by the Court\nof Appeals, see n. 1, supra, in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s\nfees.\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)               13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt nevertheless found \u201ccompelling evidence that Ms.\nHardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,\u201d and\nstated that it was \u201cinclined to rule in Ms. Hardt\u2019s favor\u201d on\nher benefits claim, but declined to do so before \u201cfirst giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its\u201d\nstatutorily mandated \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of that claim.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; 29 U. S. C. \u00a71133(2). Hardt\nthus obtained a judicial order instructing Reliance \u201cto act\non Ms. Hardt\u2019s application by adequately considering all\nthe evidence\u201d within 30 days; \u201c[o]therwise, judgment will\nbe issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. After Reliance conducted that court-ordered review,\nand consistent with the District Court\u2019s appraisal, Reli\nance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the benefits\nshe sought. App. 120a\u2013123a.\n  These facts establish that Hardt has achieved far more\nthan \u201ctrivial success on the merits\u201d or a \u201cpurely procedural\nvictory.\u201d Accordingly, she has achieved \u201csome success on\nthe merits,\u201d and the District Court properly exercised its\ndiscretion to award Hardt attorney\u2019s fees in this case.\nBecause these conclusions resolve this case, we need not\ndecide today whether a remand order, without more,\nconstitutes \u201csome success on the merits\u201d sufficient to make\na party eligible for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71132(g)(1).9\n                        *  *     *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit and remand this case for proceedings con\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Reliance has not preserved any separate objection to the reason\n\nableness of the amount of fees awarded.

Argued April 26, 2010\u2014Decided May 24, 2010\nAfter medical problems forced petitioner Hardt to stop working, she\n  filed for long-term disability benefits under her employer\u2019s long-term\n  disability plan. Upon exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\n  sued respondent Reliance, her employer\u2019s disability insurance car\n  rier, alleging that it had violated the Employee Retirement Income\n  Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) by wrongfully denying her benefits\n  claim. The District Court denied Reliance summary judgment, find\n  ing that because the carrier had acted on incomplete medical infor\n  mation, the benefits denial was not based on substantial evidence.\n  Though also denying Hardt summary judgment, the court stated that\n  it found \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d in the record that she was totally dis\n  abled and that it was inclined to rule in her favor, but concluded that\n  it would be unwise to do so without giving Reliance the chance to ad\n  dress the deficiencies in its approach. The court therefore remanded\n  to Reliance, giving it 30 days to consider all the evidence and to act\n  on Hardt\u2019s application, or else the court would enter judgment in\n  Hardt\u2019s favor. Reliance did as instructed and awarded Hardt bene\n  fits. Hardt then filed a motion under 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(g)(1), a fee\n  shifting statute that applies in most ERISA lawsuits and provides\n  that \u201cthe court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\n  and costs . . . to either party.\u201d Granting the motion, the District\n  Court applied the Circuit\u2019s framework governing attorney\u2019s fee re\n  quests in ERISA cases, concluding, inter alia, that Hardt had at\n  tained the requisite \u201cprevailing party\u201d status. The Fourth Circuit va\n  cated the fees award, holding that Hardt had failed to establish that\n  she qualified as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the rule set forth in Buck\n  hannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health\n2          HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 604, that a fee claimant is a\n    \u201cprevailing party\u201d only if he has obtained an \u201cenforceable judgmen[t]\n    on the merits \u201d or a \u201ccourt-ordered consent decre[e]. \u201d The court rea\n    soned that because the remand order did not require Reliance to\n    award Hardt benefits, it did not constitute an enforceable judgment\n    on the merits.\nHeld:\n    1. A fee claimant need not be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to be eligible for\n an attorney\u2019s fees award under \u00a71132(g)(1). Interpreting the section\n to require a party to attain that status is contrary to \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s\n plain text. The words \u201cprevailing party\u201d do not appear in the provi\n sion. Nor does anything else in \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text purport to limit the\n availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Instead,\n \u00a71132(g)(1) expressly grants district courts \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award at\n torney\u2019s fees \u201cto either party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That language\n contrasts sharply with \u00a71132(g)(2), which governs the availability of\n attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA actions to recover delinquent employer con\n tributions to a multiemployer plan. In such cases, only plaintiffs who\n obtain \u201ca judgment in favor of the plan\u201d may seek attorney\u2019s fees.\n \u00a71132(g)(2)(D). The contrast between these two paragraphs makes\n clear that Congress knows how to impose express limits on the avail\n ability of attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed to\n include in \u00a71132(g)(1) an express \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement, the\n Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision adding that term of art to the statute more\n closely resembles \u201cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\n one.\u201d Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359. Pp. 8\u20139.\n    2. A court may award fees and costs under \u00a71132(g)(1), as long as\n the fee claimant has achieved \u201csome degree of success on the merits.\u201d\n Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 694. The bedrock princi\n ple known as the American Rule provides the relevant point of refer\n ence: Each litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose, unless a\n statute or contract provides otherwise. E.g., id., at 683\u2013686. This\n Court\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d precedents do not govern here because that\n term of art does not appear in \u00a71132(g)(1). Instead, the Court inter\n prets \u00a71132(g)(1) in light of its precedents addressing statutes that\n deviate from the American Rule by authorizing attorney\u2019s fees based\n on other criteria. Ruckelshaus, which considered a statute authoriz\n ing a fees award if the court \u201cdetermines that such an award is ap\n propriate,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(f), is the principal case in that category.\n Applying that decision\u2019s interpretive approach to 29 U. S. C.\n \u00a71132(g)(1), the Court first looks to \u201cthe language of the section,\u201d 463\n U. S., at 682, which unambiguously allows a court to award attor\n ney\u2019s fees \u201cin its discretion . . . to either party.\u201d Ruckelshaus also lays\n down the proper markers to guide a court in exercising that discre\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tion. Because here, as in the statute in Ruckelshaus, Congress failed\n  to indicate clearly that it \u201cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting\n  principles and intuitive notions of fairness,\u201d 463 U. S., at 686, a fees\n  claimant must show \u201csome degree of success on the merits\u201d before a\n  court may award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71132(g)(1), see id., at 694.\n  Hardt has satisfied that standard. Though she failed to win sum\n  mary judgment on her benefits claim, the District Court nevertheless\n  found compelling evidence that she is totally disabled and stated that\n  it was inclined to rule in her favor. She also obtained the remand or\n  der, after which Reliance conducted the court-ordered review, re\n  versed its decision, and awarded the benefits she sought.

Her doctors eventually diagnosed her with\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Because surgeries on both her\nwrists failed to alleviate her pain, Hardt stopped working\n2       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nin January 2003.\n   In August 2003, Hardt sought long-term disability\nbenefits from Dan River\u2019s Group Long-Term Disability\nInsurance Program Plan (Plan). Dan River administers\nthe Plan, which is subject to ERISA, but respondent Reli\nance Standard Life Insurance Company decides whether a\nclaimant qualifies for benefits under the Plan and under\nwrites any benefits awarded. Reliance provisionally ap\nproved Hardt\u2019s claim, telling her that final approval\nhinged on her performance in a functional capacities\nevaluation intended to assess the impact of her carpal\ntunnel syndrome and neck pain on her ability to work.\n   Hardt completed the functional capacities evaluation in\nOctober 2003. The evaluator summarized Hardt\u2019s medical\nhistory, observed her resulting physical limitations, and\nultimately found that Hardt could perform some amount\nof sedentary work. Based on this finding, Reliance con\ncluded that Hardt was not totally disabled within the\nmeaning of the Plan and denied her claim for disability\nbenefits. Hardt filed an administrative appeal. Reliance\nreversed itself in part, finding that Hardt was totally\ndisabled from her regular occupation, and was therefore\nentitled to temporary disability benefits for 24 months.\n   While her administrative appeal was pending, Hardt\nbegan experiencing new symptoms in her feet and calves,\nincluding tingling, pain, and numbness. One of her physi\ncians diagnosed her with small-fiber neuropathy, a condi\ntion that increased her pain and decreased her physical\ncapabilities over the ensuing months.\n   Hardt eventually applied to the Social Security Admini\nstration for disability benefits under the Social Security\nAct. Her application included questionnaires completed\nby two of her treating physicians, which described Hardt\u2019s\nsymptoms and stated the doctors\u2019 conclusion that Hardt\ncould not return to full gainful employment because of her\nneuropathy and other ailments. In February 2005, the\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Reliance explained that under the Plan\u2019s terms,\nonly individuals who are \u201ctotally disabled from all occupa\ntions\u201d were eligible for benefits beyond that period, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 36a, and adhered to its conclusion that,\nbased on its review of Hardt\u2019s records, Hardt was not\n\u201ctotally disabled\u201d as defined by the Plan. Reliance also\ndemanded that Hardt pay Reliance $14,913.23 to offset\nthe disability benefits she had received from the Social\nSecurity Administration. (The Plan contains a provision\ncoordinating benefits with Social Security payments.)\nHardt paid Reliance the offset.\n    Hardt then filed another administrative appeal. She\ngave Reliance all of her medical records, the question\nnaires she had submitted to the Social Security Admini\nstration, and an updated questionnaire from one of her\nphysicians. Reliance asked Hardt to supplement this\nmaterial with another functional capacities evaluation.\nWhen Reliance referred Hardt for the updated evaluation,\nit did not ask the evaluator to review Hardt for neuro\npathic pain, even though it knew that Hardt had been\ndiagnosed with neuropathy after her first evaluation.\n    Hardt appeared for the updated evaluation in December\n2005, and appeared for another evaluation in January\n2006. The evaluators deemed both evaluations invalid\nbecause Hardt\u2019s efforts were \u201csubmaximal.\u201d Id., at 37a.\nOne evaluator recorded that Hardt \u201crefused multiple tests\n. . . for fear of nausea/illness/further pain complaints.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n    Lacking an updated functional capacities evaluation,\nReliance hired a physician and a vocation rehabilitation\ncounselor to help it resolve Hardt\u2019s administrative appeal.\nThe physician did not examine Hardt; instead, he re\n4       HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nviewed some, but not all, of Hardt\u2019s medical records.\nBased on that review, the physician produced a report in\nwhich he opined that Hardt\u2019s health was expected to\nimprove. His report, however, did not mention Hardt\u2019s\npain medications or the questionnaires that Hardt\u2019s at\ntending physicians had completed as part of her applica\ntion for Social Security benefits. The vocational rehabili\ntation counselor, in turn, performed a labor market study\n(based on Hardt\u2019s health in 2003) that identified eight\nemployment opportunities suitable for Hardt. After re\nviewing the physician\u2019s report, the labor market study,\nand the results of the 2003 functional capacities evalua\ntion, Reliance concluded that its decision to terminate\nHardt\u2019s benefits was correct. It advised Hardt of this\ndecision in March 2006.\n   After exhausting her administrative remedies, Hardt\nsued Reliance in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Virginia. She alleged that Reliance\nviolated ERISA by wrongfully denying her claim for long\nterm disability benefits. See \u00a71132(a)(1)(B). The parties\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment, both of which\nthe District Court denied.\n   The court first rejected Reliance\u2019s request for summary\njudgment affirming the denial of benefits, finding that\n\u201cReliance\u2019s decision to deny benefits was based on incom\nplete information.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Most\nprominently, none of the functional capacities evaluations\nto which Hardt had submitted had \u201cassessed the impact of\nneuropathy and neuropathic pain on Ms. Hardt.\u201d Ibid. In\naddition, the reviewing physician\u2019s report \u201cwas itself\nincomplete\u201d; the basis for the physician\u2019s \u201cmedical conclu\nsions [wa]s extremely vague and conclusory,\u201d ibid., and\nthe physician had \u201cfailed to cite any medical evidence to\nsupport his conclusions,\u201d id., at 43a, or \u201cto address the\ntreating physicians\u2019 contradictory medical findings,\u201d id., at\n44a. The court also found that Reliance had \u201cimproperly\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrejected much of the evidence that Ms. Hardt submitted,\u201d\nid., at 45a, and had \u201cfurther ignored the substantial\namount of pain medication Ms. Hardt\u2019s treating physi\ncians had prescribed to her,\u201d id., at 46a. Accordingly, the\ncourt thought it \u201cclear that Reliance\u2019s decision to deny Ms.\nHardt long-term disability benefits was not based on\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Id., at 47a.\n   The District Court then denied Hardt\u2019s motion for sum\nmary judgment, which contended that Reliance\u2019s decision\nto deny benefits was unreasonable as a matter of law. In\nso doing, however, the court found \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d\nin the record that \u201cMs. Hardt [wa]s totally disabled due to\nher neuropathy.\u201d Id., at 48a. Although it was \u201cinclined to\nrule in Ms. Hardt\u2019s favor,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cit\nwould be unwise to take this step without first giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its ap\nproach.\u201d Ibid. In the District Court\u2019s view, a remand to\nReliance was warranted because \u201c[t]his case presents one\nof those scenarios where the plan administrator has failed\nto comply with the ERISA guidelines,\u201d meaning \u201cMs.\nHardt did not get the kind of review to which she was\nentitled under applicable law.\u201d Ibid. Accordingly, the\ncourt instructed \u201cReliance to act on Ms. Hardt\u2019s applica\ntion by adequately considering all the evidence\u201d within 30\ndays; \u201c[o]therwise,\u201d it warned, \u201cjudgment will be issued in\nfavor of Ms. Hardt.\u201d Id., at 49a.\n   Reliance did as instructed.         After conducting that\nreview, Reliance found Hardt eligible for long-term dis\nability benefits and paid her $55,250 in accrued, past-due\nbenefits.\n   Hardt then moved for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under\n\u00a71132(g)(1). The District Court assessed her motion under\nthe three-step framework that governed fee requests in\nERISA cases under Circuit precedent. At step one of that\nframework, a district court asks whether the fee claimant\nis a \u201c \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 15a\u201316a (quoting Martin\n6         HARDT v.

S. 598, 603 (2001)). If the fee\nclaimant qualifies as a prevailing party, the court proceeds\nto step two and \u201cdetermin[es] whether an award of attor\nneys\u2019 fees is appropriate\u201d by examining \u201cfive factors.\u201d1\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 16a. Finally, if those five factors\nsuggest that a fees award is appropriate, the court \u201cmust\nreview the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs requested and limit\nthem to a reasonable amount.\u201d Id., at 17a (citing Hensley\nv. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 433 (1983)).\n   Applying that framework, the District Court granted\nHardt\u2019s motion. It first concluded that Hardt was a pre\nvailing party because the court\u2019s remand order \u201csanctioned\na material change in the legal relationship of the parties\nby ordering [Reliance] to conduct the type of review to\nwhich [Hardt] was entitled.\u201d Id., at 22a. The court recog\nnized that the order did not \u201csanctio[n] a certain result on\nremand,\u201d but found that it \u201cquite clearly expressed the\nconsequences to [Reliance] were it to fail to complete its\nreconsideration in an expeditious manner.\u201d Id., at 19a.\nAccordingly, the remand order \u201csignif[ied] that the court\nwas displeased with the cursory review that [Reliance]\nhad initially given to [Hardt\u2019s] claim, but was inclined to\nreserve judgment and permit [Reliance] to conduct a\nproper review of all of the medical evidence.\u201d Ibid.

According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Hardt failed to satisfy the step-one\ninquiry\u2014i.e., she failed to establish that she was a \u201cpre\nvailing party.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the Court of\nAppeals relied on this Court\u2019s decision in Buckhannon,\nunder which a fee claimant qualifies as a \u201cprevailing\nparty\u201d only if he has obtained an \u201c \u2018enforceable judgmen[t]\non the merits\u2019 \u201d or a \u201c \u2018court-ordered consent decre[e].\u2019 \u201d 336\nFed. Appx. 332, 335 (CA4 2009) (per curiam) (quoting 532\nU. S., at 604). The Court of Appeals reasoned that be\ncause the remand order \u201cdid not require Reliance to award\nbenefits to Hardt,\u201d it did \u201cnot constitute an \u2018enforceable\njudgment on the merits\u2019 as Buckhannon requires,\u201d thus\nprecluding Hardt from establishing prevailing party\nstatus. 336 Fed. Appx., at 336 (brackets omitted).\n  Hardt filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking\nreview of two aspects of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.\nFirst, did the Court of Appeals correctly conclude that\n\u00a71132(g)(1) permits courts to award attorney\u2019s fees only to\na \u201cprevailing party\u201d?2 Second, did the Court of Appeals\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Courts of Appeals are divided on this issue. Some (a few only\n\ntentatively) agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion here that only\nprevailing parties are entitled to fees under \u00a71132(g)(1). See, e.g.,\nCottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F. 3d 220, 225 (CA1\n1996) (\u201cCongress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a\n\u2018participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may\nallow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 to the prevailing party\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); Tate v.

S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5).\n  Section 1132(g)(1) provides:\n     \u201cIn any action under this subchapter (other than an\n     action described in paragraph (2)) by a participant,\n     beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion\n     may allow a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and costs of ac\n     tion to either party.\u201d\nThe words \u201cprevailing party\u201d do not appear in this provi\nsion. Nor does anything else in \u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text purport\nto limit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing\nparty.\u201d Instead, \u00a71132(g)(1) expressly grants district\ncourts \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cto either\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nis not a prevailing party in the truest sense of the term\u201d (some internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)); Graham v. Hartford Life and\nAccident Ins. Co., 501 F. 3d 1153, 1162 (CA10 2007) (\u201cWe also afford\ncertain weight to prevailing party status, even though we acknowledge\nthat the ERISA attorney\u2019s fees provision is not expressly directed at\nprevailing parties\u201d). Other Courts of Appeals have rejected or dis\navowed that position. See, e.g., Miller v. United Welfare Fund, 72 F. 3d\n1066, 1074 (CA2 1995); Gibbs v. Gibbs, 210 F. 3d 491, 503 (CA5 2000);\nFreeman v. Continental Ins. Co., 996 F. 2d 1116, 1119 (CA11 1993).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparty.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n  That language contrasts sharply with \u00a71132(g)(2), which\ngoverns the availability of attorney\u2019s fees in ERISA actions\nunder \u00a71145 (actions to recover delinquent employer\ncontributions to a multiemployer plan). In such cases,\nonly plaintiffs who obtain \u201ca judgment in favor of the plan\u201d\nmay seek attorney\u2019s fees. \u00a71132(g)(2)(D). The contrast\nbetween these two paragraphs makes clear that Congress\nknows how to impose express limits on the availability of\nattorney\u2019s fees in ERISA cases. Because Congress failed\nto include in \u00a71132(g)(1) an express \u201cprevailing party\u201d\nlimit on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees, the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision adding that term of art to a fee-shifting\nstatute from which it is conspicuously absent more closely\nresembles \u201cinvent[ing] a statute rather than interpret[ing]\none.\u201d Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U. S. 349, 359\n(2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  We see no reason to dwell any longer on this question,\nparticularly given Reliance\u2019s concessions. See Brief for\nRespondent 9\u201310 (\u201cOn its face,\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1) \u201cdoes not\nexpressly demand, like so many statutes, that a claimant\nbe a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 before receiving attorney\u2019s fees\u201d).\nWe therefore hold that a fee claimant need not be a \u201cpre\nvailing party\u201d to be eligible for an attorney\u2019s fees award\nunder \u00a71132(g)(1).\n                             III\n   We next consider the circumstances under which a court\nmay award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a71132(g)(1). \u201cOur\nbasic point of reference\u201d when considering the award of\nattorney\u2019s fees is the bedrock principle known as the\n\u201c \u2018American Rule\u2019 \u201d: Each litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s\nfees, win or lose, unless a statute or contract provides\notherwise. Ruckelshaus, 463 U. S., at 683; see id., at 683\u2013\n686; Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society,\n421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975); Buckhannon, supra, at 602\u2013603;\n10        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsee also Perdue v. Kenny A., 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 5). Statutory changes to this rule take various\nforms. Most fee-shifting provisions permit a court to\naward attorney\u2019s fees only to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d 3 Others\npermit a \u201csubstantially prevailing\u201d party 4 or a \u201csuccessful\u201d\nlitigant 5 to obtain fees. Still others authorize district\ncourts to award attorney\u2019s fees where \u201cappropriate,\u201d 6 or\nsimply vest district courts with \u201cdiscretion\u201d to award fees.7\n   Of those statutory deviations from the American Rule,\nwe have most often considered statutes containing an\nexpress \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement. See, e.g., Texas\nState Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,\n489 U. S. 782, 792\u2013793 (1989); Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S.\n103, 109\u2013114 (1992); Buckhannon, supra, at 602\u2013606; Sole\nv. Wyner, 551 U. S. 74, 82\u201386 (2007). Our \u201cprevailing\nparty\u201d precedents, however, do not govern the availability\nof fees awards under \u00a71132(g)(1), because this provision\ndoes not limit the availability of attorney\u2019s fees to the\n\u201cprevailing party.\u201d Supra, at 8\u20139; see also Gross, supra, at\n___, (slip op., at 6) (cautioning courts \u201cconducting statu\ntory interpretation . . . \u2018not to apply rules applicable under\none statute to a different statute without careful and\ncritical examination\u2019 \u201d (quoting Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 393 (2008))).\n   Instead, we interpret \u00a71132(g)(1) in light of our prece\ndents addressing statutory deviations from the American\nRule that do not limit attorney\u2019s fees awards to the \u201cpre\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 See, e.g., Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia\n\nDept. of Health and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 601\u2013603 (2001)\n(citing examples); Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.

S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvailing party.\u201d In that line of precedents, Ruckelshaus is\nthe principal case. There, the Court interpreted \u00a7307(f) of\nthe Clean Air Act, which authorizes a court to award fees\n\u201cwhenever it determines that such an award is appropri\nate.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a77607(f). We began by noting that be\ncause nothing in \u00a7307(f)\u2019s text \u201cclear[ly] show[ed]\u201d that\nCongress meant to abandon the American Rule, 463 U. S.,\nat 685, fee claimants must have achieved some litigating\nsuccess to be eligible for a fees award under that section,\nid., at 686. We then concluded that by using the less\nstringent \u201cwhenever . . . appropriate\u201d standard instead of\nthe traditional \u201cprevailing party\u201d standard, Congress had\n\u201cexpand[ed] the class of parties eligible for fees awards\nfrom prevailing parties to partially prevailing parties\u2014\nparties achieving some success, even if not major success.\u201d\nId., at 688. We thus held \u201cthat, absent some degree of\nsuccess on the merits by the claimant, it is not \u2018appropri\nate\u2019 for a federal court to award attorney\u2019s fees under\n\u00a7307(f).\u201d Id., at 694.\n   Applying the interpretive approach we employed in\nRuckelshaus to \u00a71132(g)(1), we first look to \u201cthe language\nof the section,\u201d id., at 682, which unambiguously allows a\ncourt to award attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin its discretion . . . to\neither party,\u201d \u00a71132(g)(1). Statutes vesting judges with\nsuch broad discretion are well known in the law, particu\nlarly in the attorney\u2019s fees context. See, e.g., n. 7, supra;\nsee also Perdue, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   Equally well known, however, is the fact that a \u201cjudge\u2019s\ndiscretion is not unlimited.\u201d Ibid. Consistent with Cir\ncuit precedent, the District Court applied five factors to\nguide its discretion in deciding whether to award attor\nney\u2019s fees under \u00a71132(g)(1). See supra, at 6, and n. 1.\nBecause these five factors bear no obvious relation to\n\u00a71132(g)(1)\u2019s text or to our fee-shifting jurisprudence, they\nare not required for channeling a court\u2019s discretion when\nawarding fees under this section.\n12        HARDT v. RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE INS. CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Instead, Ruckelshaus lays down the proper markers to\nguide a court in exercising the discretion that \u00a71132(g)(1)\ngrants. As in the statute at issue in Ruckelshaus, Con\ngress failed to indicate clearly in \u00a71132(g)(1) that it\n\u201cmeant to abandon historic fee-shifting principles and\nintuitive notions of fairness.\u201d 463 U. S., at 686. Accord\ningly, a fees claimant must show \u201csome degree of success\non the merits\u201d before a court may award attorney\u2019s fees\nunder \u00a71132(g)(1), id., at 694. A claimant does not satisfy\nthat requirement by achieving \u201ctrivial success on the\nmerits\u201d or a \u201cpurely procedural victor[y],\u201d but does satisfy\nit if the court can fairly call the outcome of the litigation\nsome success on the merits without conducting a \u201clengthy\ninquir[y] into the question whether a particular party\u2019s\nsuccess was \u2018substantial\u2019 or occurred on a \u2018central issue.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 688, n. 9.8\n   Reliance essentially agrees that this standard should\ngovern fee requests under \u00a71132(g)(1), see Brief for Re\nspondent 13\u201331, but argues that Hardt has not satisfied it.\nSpecifically, Reliance contends that a court order remand\ning an ERISA claim for further consideration can never\nconstitute \u201csome success on the merits,\u201d even if such a\nremand results in an award of benefits. See id., at 34\u201350.\n   Reliance\u2019s argument misses the point, given the facts of\nthis case. Hardt persuaded the District Court to find that\n\u201cthe plan administrator has failed to comply with the\nERISA guidelines\u201d and \u201cthat Ms. Hardt did not get the\nkind of review to which she was entitled under applicable\nlaw.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; see 29 U. S. C. \u00a71133(2),\n29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131(h) (2009). Although Hardt failed to\nwin summary judgment on her benefits claim, the District\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We do not foreclose the possibility that once a claimant has satisfied\n\nthis requirement, and thus becomes eligible for a fees award under\n\u00a71132(g)(1), a court may consider the five factors adopted by the Court\nof Appeals, see n. 1, supra, in deciding whether to award attorney\u2019s\nfees.\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)               13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt nevertheless found \u201ccompelling evidence that Ms.\nHardt is totally disabled due to her neuropathy,\u201d and\nstated that it was \u201cinclined to rule in Ms. Hardt\u2019s favor\u201d on\nher benefits claim, but declined to do so before \u201cfirst giving\nReliance the chance to address the deficiencies in its\u201d\nstatutorily mandated \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of that claim.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 48a; 29 U. S. C. \u00a71133(2). Hardt\nthus obtained a judicial order instructing Reliance \u201cto act\non Ms. Hardt\u2019s application by adequately considering all\nthe evidence\u201d within 30 days; \u201c[o]therwise, judgment will\nbe issued in favor of Ms. Hardt.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n49a. After Reliance conducted that court-ordered review,\nand consistent with the District Court\u2019s appraisal, Reli\nance reversed its decision and awarded Hardt the benefits\nshe sought. App. 120a\u2013123a.\n  These facts establish that Hardt has achieved far more\nthan \u201ctrivial success on the merits\u201d or a \u201cpurely procedural\nvictory.\u201d Accordingly, she has achieved \u201csome success on\nthe merits,\u201d and the District Court properly exercised its\ndiscretion to award Hardt attorney\u2019s fees in this case.\nBecause these conclusions resolve this case, we need not\ndecide today whether a remand order, without more,\nconstitutes \u201csome success on the merits\u201d sufficient to make\na party eligible for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a71132(g)(1).9\n                        *  *     *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nFourth Circuit and remand this case for proceedings con\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Reliance has not preserved any separate objection to the reason\n\nableness of the amount of fees awarded.

Si\nerra Club, 463 U. S. 680 (1983), should be given any spe\ncial weight in the interpretation of this\u2014or any other\u2014\ndifferent statutory provision. The outcome in that closely\ndivided case turned, to a significant extent, on a judgment\nabout how to read the legislative history of the provision\nin question. Compare id., at 686\u2013693, with id., at 703\u2013706\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting). I agree with the Court in this\ncase that 29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(g)(1) does not impose a \u201cpre\nvailing party\u201d requirement; I agree, further, that the\nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion in awarding\nattorney\u2019s fees to this petitioner. But I would examine the\ntext, structure, and history of any other federal statute\nauthorizing an award of fees before concluding that Con\ngress intended the same approach under that statute as\nunder this one.\n</pre>",
