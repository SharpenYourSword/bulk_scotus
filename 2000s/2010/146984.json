O’BRIEN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08–1569. Argued February 23, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nRespondents O’Brien and Burgess each carried a firearm during an\n  attempted robbery. Count three of their indictment charged them\n  with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, which car\n  ries a mandatory minimum 5-year prison term.                18 U. S. C.\n  §924(c)(1)(A)(i). Count four alleged use of a machinegun (here, a pis\n  tol that authorities believed operated as a fully automatic firearm) in\n  furtherance of that crime, which carries a 30-year mandatory mini\n  mum term. §924(c)(1)(B)(ii). The Government moved to dismiss the\n  fourth count on the basis that it could not establish the count beyond\n  a reasonable doubt, but it maintained that §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)’s ma\n  chinegun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be determined\n  by the District Court upon a conviction on count three. The court\n  dismissed count four and rejected the Government’s sentencing\n  enhancement position. Respondents then pleaded guilty to the re\n  maining counts. The court sentenced O’Brien to a 102-month term\n  and Burgess to an 84-month term for their §924(c) convictions. In af\n  firming the District Court’s §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) ruling, the First Circuit\n  looked primarily to Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, which\n  held that the machinegun provision in an earlier version of §924(c)\n  constituted an element of an offense, not a sentencing factor. The\n  court found that Castillo was “close to binding,” absent clearer or\n  more dramatic changes than those made by Congress’ 1998 amend\n  ment of §924(c) or a clearer legislative history.\nHeld: The fact that a firearm was a machinegun is an element to be\n proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, not a sentencing factor\n to be proved to the judge at sentencing. Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) Generally, a fact that “increase[s] the prescribed range of penal\n ties to which a criminal defendant is exposed” is an element of a\n2                      UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, to be charged in\n    an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Ham\n    ling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117, rather than proved to a judge\n    at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence, McMillan v. Penn\n    sylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92. Subject to this constitutional con\n    straint, Congress determines whether a factor is an element or a sen\n    tencing factor. When Congress is not explicit, courts look to a\n    statute’s provisions and framework for guidance. Analysis of the cur\n    rent machinegun provision begins with Castillo, where the Court\n    found the bare language of §924’s prior version “neutral,” 530 U. S.,\n    at 124, but ruled that four factors—(1) language and structure, (2)\n    tradition, (3) risk of unfairness, and (4) severity of the sentence—\n    favored treating the machinegun provision as an element of an of\n    fense, id., at 124−131; while a fifth factor—legislative history—did\n    not favor either side, ibid. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) As relevant here, the 1998 amendment divided what was once a\n    lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs. Thus, with\n    regard to the first Castillo factor, the Court’s observation that “Con\n    gress placed the element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma\n    chinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or sepa\n    rated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no longer holds true.\n    However, the amendment did not affect the second through fifth Cas\n    tillo factors. Each of them, except for legislative history (which re\n    mains relatively silent), continues to favor treating the machinegun\n    provision as an element. The amendment’s effect on the language\n    and structure factor requires closer examination. Pp. 6–12.\n       (c) Given the Court’s determination in Castillo that the machine\n    gun provision in §924’s prior version is an element, a substantive\n    change in the statute should not be inferred “[a]bsent a clear indica\n    tion from Congress of a change in policy,” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S.\n    279, 290. Nothing in the 1998 amendment indicates such a change.\n    There are three principal differences between the previous and cur\n    rent §924(c). The first, a substantive change, shifts what were once\n    mandatory 5-year and 30-year sentences to mandatory minimum\n    sentences. The second, also substantive—made in direct response to\n    the holding in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, that “uses or\n    carries” in §924’s preamendment version connotes “more than mere\n    possession,” id., at 143—adds “possesses” to the “uses or carries” lan\n    guage in §924(c)’s principal paragraph and provides sentencing en\n    hancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm,\n    §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which do state sentencing factors, Harris v.\n    United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552−556. Neither of these substantive\n    changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun\n    provision from an element into a sentencing factor. The third differ\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ence is the machinegun provision’s relocation from the principal\n  paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate\n  subsection, §924(c)(1)(B), but this structural or stylistic change pro\n  vides no “clear indication” that Congress meant to alter its treatment\n  of machineguns as an offense element. A more logical explanation is\n  that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal\n  paragraph, which exceeded 250 words, into a more readable statute,\n  which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines. While\n  this Court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections\n  is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentenc\n  ing factors rather than elements, Castillo, supra, at 124−125, it has\n  rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates\n  even when other factors point in the other direction, Harris, supra, at\n  553. The current structure of §924(c) is more favorable to treating\n  the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in\n  Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now posi\n  tioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii) and\n  those in (C)(i) and (ii). This structural point is overcome by the sub\n  stantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that\n  Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear in\n  dication of its purpose to do so.

MARTIN O’BRIEN \n\n            AND ARTHUR BURGESS \n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [May 24, 2010] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Court must interpret, once again, §924(c) of Title 18\nof the United States Code. This provision prohibits the\nuse or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of vio\nlence or drug trafficking crime, or the possession of a\nfirearm in furtherance of such crimes. §924(c)(1)(A). A\nviolation of the statute carries a mandatory minimum\nterm of five years’ imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(A)(i); but if\nthe firearm is a machinegun, the statute requires a 30\nyear mandatory minimum sentence, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii).\nWhether a firearm was used, carried, or possessed is, as\nall concede, an element of the offense. At issue here is\nwhether the fact that the firearm was a machinegun is an\nelement to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable\ndoubt or a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at\nsentencing.\n   In an earlier case the Court determined that an analo\ngous machinegun provision in a previous version of §924\nconstituted an element of an offense to be proved to the\njury. Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120 (2000). The\nCastillo decision, however, addressed the statute as it\n2               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nexisted before congressional amendments made in 1998.\nAnd in a case after Castillo, the brandishing provision in\nthe post-1998 version of §924 was held to provide a sen\ntencing factor, not an element of the offense. Harris v.\nUnited States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002). In light of the 1998\namendments and the Harris decision, the question of how\nto interpret §924’s machinegun provision is considered\nonce more in the instant case.\n                              I\n   On June 16, 2005, respondents Martin O’Brien and\nArthur Burgess attempted to rob an armored car making a\nscheduled delivery of cash to a bank. Along with a third\ncollaborator, respondents hid in a minivan and waited for\nthe armored car to make its stop. Each of the men carried\na firearm. Containing nearly $2 million and attended by\ntwo guards, the armored car arrived. A guard began to\nunload boxes of coins. The three men came out of the van\nand, while one of them brandished his weapon, they or\ndered the guards to get on the ground. One guard did so,\nbut the other ran to a nearby restaurant. The respondents\nabandoned the robbery and fled without taking any\nmoney. No shots were fired, and no one was injured.\n   Authorities apprehended respondents and recovered the\nthree firearms used during the attempted robbery. The\nfirearms were a semiautomatic Sig-Sauer pistol, an\nAK−47 semiautomatic rifle, and a Cobray pistol. The\nCobray pistol had been manufactured as, and had the\nexternal appearance of, a semiautomatic firearm. Accord\ning to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, though, it\noperated as a fully automatic weapon, apparently due to\nsome alteration of its original firing mechanism. Respon\ndents dispute whether the Cobray in fact did operate as a\nfully automatic weapon.\n   Respondents were indicted on multiple counts. Rele\nvant here are counts three and four, both of which charged\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenses under §924(c). Count three charged respondents\nwith using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,\nwhich carries a statutory minimum of five years’ impris\nonment. Count four charged respondents in more specific\nterms, alleging use of a machinegun (the Cobray) in fur\ntherance of a crime of violence, as proscribed by\n§§924(c)(1)(A) and (B)(ii). The latter provision mandates a\nminimum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment.\n   The Government moved to dismiss count four on the\nbasis that it would be unable to establish the count beyond\na reasonable doubt. (The issues in the present case do not\nrequire the Court to consider any contention that a defen\ndant who uses, carries, or possesses a firearm must be\naware of the weapon’s characteristics. This opinion ex\npresses no views on the point.)\n   The Government then maintained that the machinegun\nprovision in §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) was a sentencing factor, so\nthat, if respondents were convicted of carrying a firearm\nunder count three, the court could determine at sentencing\nthat the particular firearm was a machinegun, thus acti\nvating the 30-year mandatory minimum. The District\nCourt dismissed count four, as the Government requested,\nbut rejected the Government’s position that the machine\ngun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be deter\nmined by the court at sentencing once there was a convic\ntion on count three. It ruled that the machinegun\nprovision states an element of a crime. Thus, to invoke\nthe 30-year minimum sentence, the Government was\nrequired to charge in the indictment, and then prove to\nthe jury, that the Cobray was a machinegun.\n   At this point, after the District Court foreclosed the\npossibility of respondents’ facing a 30-year minimum,\nrespondents pleaded guilty to the remaining counts, in\ncluding count three. The      District   Court    sentenced\nO’Brien to a 102-month term for his §924(c) conviction, to\nrun consecutively with his sentence on two other counts.\n4                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIt sentenced Burgess to an 84-month term for his §924(c)\nconviction, also to run consecutively to his sentence on the\nother charges. The Government appealed the District\nCourt’s ruling that the §924 machinegun provision consti\ntutes an element of an offense instead of a sentencing\nfactor.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\naffirmed. It looked primarily to Castillo, 530 U. S. 120,\nwhich held that the machinegun provision in an earlier\nversion of §924(c) constituted an element of an offense, not\na sentencing factor. The court noted that the statute\nunder consideration in Castillo had been revised by Con\ngress, “break[ing] what was a single run-on sentence into\nsubparagraphs,” and it acknowledged that the earlier\nrepealed version of the statute was “slightly more favor\nable to the [respondents] than the current version[,] but\nnot markedly so.” 542 F. 3d 921, 925 (2008). It found “no\nevidence that the breaking up of the sentence into the\npresent subdivisions or recasting of language was any\nthing more than a current trend—probably for ease of\nreading—to convert lengthy sentences in criminal statutes\ninto subsections in the fashion of the tax code.” Id., at\n926. The court concluded: “Absent a clearer or more dra\nmatic change in language or legislative history expressing\na specific intent to assign judge or jury functions, we think\nthat Castillo is close to binding,” and any reconsideration\nof the issue should be left to this Court. Ibid.; see also\nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,\n490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has\ndirect application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\nrejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Ap\npeals should follow the case which directly controls, leav\ning to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own\ndecisions”).\n   We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Hamling\nv. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974); Jones v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 227, 232 (1999). Sentencing factors, on\nthe other hand, can be proved to a judge at sentencing by\na preponderance of the evidence. See McMillan v. Penn\nsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92 (1986). Though one excep\ntion has been established, see Almendarez-Torres v.\nUnited States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998), “ ‘[i]t is unconsti\ntutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the\nassessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of\npenalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting\nJones, supra, at 252−253 (STEVENS, J., concurring)). In\nother words, while sentencing factors may guide or confine\na judge’s discretion in sentencing an offender “within the\nrange prescribed by statute,” Apprendi, supra, at 481,\njudge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maxi\nmum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based\npurely on the facts found by the jury.\n   Subject to this constitutional constraint, whether a\ngiven fact is an element of the crime itself or a sentencing\nfactor is a question for Congress. When Congress is not\nexplicit, as is often the case because it seldom directly\naddresses the distinction between sentencing factors and\nelements, courts look to the provisions and the framework\nof the statute to determine whether a fact is an element or\na sentencing factor. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 228. In\nexamining whether the machinegun provision in §924 is\nan element or a sentencing factor, the analysis must begin\nwith this Court’s previous examination of the question in\nCastillo.\n   In Castillo, the Court considered a prior version of §924,\nwhich provided:\n6                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n       “(c)(1) Whoever, during and in relation to any crime\n    of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or car\n    ries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n    provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking\n    crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,\n    and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle [or a] short\n    barreled shotgun to imprisonment for ten years, and if\n    the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device,\n    or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muf\n    fler, to imprisonment for thirty years. . . .” 18 U. S. C.\n    §924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V).\nIn determining whether the machinegun provision in the\njust-quoted version of §924 constituted an element or a\nsentencing factor, the Court in Castillo observed that the\nbare statutory language was “neutral.” 530 U. S., at 124.\nIt examined five factors directed at determining congres\nsional intent: (1) language and structure, (2) tradition, (3)\nrisk of unfairness, (4) severity of the sentence, and (5)\nlegislative history. Id., at 124−131. The Court unani\nmously concluded that the machinegun provision provided\nan element of an offense, noting that the first four factors\nfavored treating it as such while legislative history did not\nsignificantly favor either side. Ibid.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  Section 924(c) was amended to its current form in 1998.\nThe amendment had been enacted when the Court consid\nered Castillo, supra, at 125, but the pre-1998 version of\nthe statute was at issue there. The instant case concerns\nthe post-1998 (and current) version of the statute, which\nprovides:\n      “(A) Except to the extent that a greater minimum\n    sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or\n    by any other provision of law, any person who, during\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    and in relation to any crime of violence or drug traf\n    ficking crime . . . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in\n    furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm,\n    shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such\n    crime of violence or drug trafficking crime—\n       “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n    less than 5 years;\n       “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n       “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\n       “(B) If the firearm possessed by a person convicted\n    of a violation of this subsection—\n       “(i) is a short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun,\n    or semiautomatic assault weapon, the person shall be\n    sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than\n    10 years; or\n       “(ii) is a machinegun or a destructive device, or is\n    equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler,\n    the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprison\n    ment of not less than 30 years.” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)\n    (2006 ed.).\n  The 1998 amendment did make substantive changes to\nthe statute, to be discussed below; but for purposes of the\npresent case the most apparent effect of the amendment\nwas to divide what was once a lengthy principal sentence\ninto separate subparagraphs. This Court’s observation in\nconsidering the first Castillo factor, that “Congress placed\nthe element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma\nchinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes\nor separated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no\nlonger holds true. Aside from this new structure, however,\nthe 1998 amendment of §924 did nothing to affect the\nsecond through fifth Castillo factors. Each of the factors,\nexcept for legislative history (which, assuming its rele\n8                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvance, remains relatively silent), continues to favor the\nconclusion that the machinegun provision is an element of\nan offense.\n   Legal tradition and past congressional practice are the\nsecond Castillo factor. The factor is to be consulted when,\nas here, a statute’s text is unclear as to whether certain\nfacts constitute elements or sentencing factors. Sentenc\ning factors traditionally involve characteristics of the\noffender—such as recidivism, cooperation with law en\nforcement, or acceptance of responsibility. Id., at 126.\nCharacteristics of the offense itself are traditionally\ntreated as elements, and the use of a machinegun under\n§924(c) lies “closest to the heart of the crime at issue.” Id.,\nat 127. This is no less true today than it was 10 years ago\nin Castillo. Unsurprisingly, firearm type is treated as an\nelement in a number of statutes, as “numerous gun crimes\nmake substantive distinctions between weapons such as\npistols and machineguns.” Ibid.; see, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\n§§922(a)(4), 922(b)(4), and 922(o)(1).\n   The Government counters that this tradition or pattern\nhas evolved since the version of §924(c) under review in\nCastillo was enacted. The Government contends that the\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines altered the tradition by\ntreating the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor.\nBrief for United States 23 (citing United States Sentenc\ning Commission, Guidelines Manual §2K2.1(a)(5) (Nov.\n1998) (raising base offense level “if the offense involved a\nfirearm”)).\n   The argument is not persuasive. The Sentencing Re\nform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, establishing the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines, was enacted four years before the\nversion of §924 under review in Castillo, see Anti-Drug\nAbuse Act of 1988, §6460, 102 Stat. 4373. While the re\nsulting Guidelines were not effective until 1987, this was\nstill before the 1988 enactment of the statute at issue in\nCastillo, and 13 years before this Court’s conclusion in\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCastillo that firearm type is traditionally treated as an\noffense element. The Government cannot claim the bene\nfit of any shift in how the law traditionally treats firearm\ntype from the Guidelines, for that supposed shift would\nhave occurred before the 1988 version of §924 was en\nacted. The Guidelines were explicitly taken into account\nwhen this Court analyzed the traditions in Castillo. 530\nU. S., at 126 (discussing Federal Sentencing Guidelines in\ndetermining what traditionally qualifies as a sentencing\nfactor).\n   The third Castillo factor, potential unfairness, was\nunchanged by the restructuring of §924. The Court ex\nplained in Castillo that treating the machinegun provision\nas a sentencing factor “might unnecessarily produce a\nconflict between the judge and the jury” because “a jury\nmay well have to decide which of several weapons” a\ndefendant used. Id., at 128. The concern was that the\njudge may not know which weapon the jurors determined\na defendant used, and “a judge’s later, sentencing-related\ndecision that the defendant used the machinegun, rather\nthan, say, the pistol, might conflict with the jury’s belief\nthat he actively used the pistol.” Ibid. This same concern\narises under the current version of §924, where jurors\nmight have to determine which among several weapons a\ndefendant used, carried, or possessed in furtherance of a\ncrime.\n   The Government’s response, that permitting a judge to\nmake this finding would “streamlin[e] guilt-stage proceed\nings, without interfering with the accuracy of fact-finding,”\nBrief for United States 33, is unconvincing. It does not\naddress the particular unfairness concern expressed in\nCastillo, which was not alleviated by the restructuring of\n§924. And the Government does not suggest that it would\nbe subjected to any unfairness if the machinegun provision\ncontinues to be treated as an element.\n   The fourth Castillo factor, the severity of the sentence\n10               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naccompanying a finding that a defendant carried a ma\nchinegun under §924, was also unaffected by the statute’s\nrestructuring. A finding that a defendant carried a ma\nchinegun under §924, in contrast to some less dangerous\nfirearm, vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen\ntence from 5 to 30 years, Castillo, supra, at 131, or from 7\nto 30 years if, as in this case, the firearm was brandished,\n§924(c)(1)(A)(ii). This is not akin to the “incremental\nchanges in the minimum” that one would “expect to see in\nprovisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing\njudge’s consideration,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 554 (from 5\nyears to 7 years); it is a drastic, sixfold increase that\nstrongly suggests a separate substantive crime.\n   There is one substantive difference between the old and\nnew versions of §924 that might bear on this fourth factor.\nThe previous version of §924 provided mandatory sen\ntences: 5 years for using or carrying a firearm and 30\nyears if the firearm is a machinegun, for example. See\n§924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The current statute pro\nvides only mandatory minimums: not less than 5 years for\nusing or possessing a firearm; not less than 7 for brandish\ning it; and not less than 30 if the firearm is a machinegun.\n§§924(c)(1)(A)(i), (A)(ii), (B)(ii). The Government argues\nthat this difference is critical because a 30-year sentence\nis conceivable under the statute even without a finding\nthat the particular weapon is a machinegun. Brief for\nUnited States 25.\n   This is a distinction in theory, perhaps, but not in prac\ntice. Neither the Government nor any party or amicus has\nidentified a single defendant whose conviction under §924\nfor possessing or brandishing a nonspecific firearm led to a\nsentence approaching the 30-year sentence that is re\nquired when the firearm is a machinegun. Respondents\nadvise, without refutation, that most courts impose the\nmandatory minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment for bran\ndishing a nonspecific weapon and the longest sentence\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat has come to the litigants’ or the Court’s attention is\n14 years. Brief for Respondent O’Brien 46, 48 (citing\nUnited States v. Batts, 317 Fed. Appx. 329 (CA4 2009) (per\ncuriam)); see also Harris, supra, at 578 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). Indeed, in the instant case, Burgess received\nthe statutory minimum 7-year sentence, and O’Brien\nreceived only 18 months more than that. Once the ma\nchinegun enhancement was off the table, the Government\nitself did not seek anything approaching 30-year terms,\ninstead requesting 12-year terms for each respondent.\n   The immense danger posed by machineguns, the moral\ndepravity in choosing the weapon, and the substantial\nincrease in the minimum sentence provided by the statute\nsupport the conclusion that this prohibition is an element\nof the crime, not a sentencing factor. It is not likely that\nCongress intended to remove the indictment and jury trial\nprotections when it provided for such an extreme sentenc\ning increase. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 233 (“It is at best\nquestionable whether the specification of facts sufficient to\nincrease a penalty range by two-thirds, let alone from 15\nyears to life, was meant to carry none of the process safe\nguards that elements of an offense bring with them for a\ndefendant’s benefit”). Perhaps Congress was not con\ncerned with parsing the distinction between elements and\nsentencing factors, a matter more often discussed by the\ncourts when discussing the proper allocation of functions\nbetween judge and jury. Instead, it likely was more fo\ncused on deterring the crime by creating the mandatory\nminimum sentences. But the severity of the increase in\nthis case counsels in favor of finding that the prohibition is\nan element, at least absent some clear congressional indi\ncation to the contrary.\n   The fifth factor considered in Castillo was legislative\nhistory, and the Court there found it to be of little help.\n530 U. S., at 130 (“Insofar as this history may be relevant,\nhowever, it does not significantly help the Government”).\n12               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe 1998 amendment has its own legislative record, dis\ncussed below, but the parties accurately observe that it is\nsilent as to congressional consideration of the distinction\nbetween elements and sentencing factors. Brief for United\nStates 29; Brief for Respondent O’Brien 28−29. This\nsilence is not neutral, however, because as explained\nbelow, it tends to counsel against finding that Congress\nmade a substantive change to this statutory provision.\n   Four of the five factors the Court relied upon in Castillo\npoint in the same direction they did 10 years ago. How\nthe 1998 amendment affects the remaining factor—the\nprovision’s language and structure—requires closer\nexamination.\n                              B\n   In Castillo, the Court interpreted §924(c) in its original\nversion, though Congress had at that point already\namended the provision. Here, the applicable principle is\nthat Congress does not enact substantive changes sub\nsilentio. See Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB,\n531 U. S. 316, 323 (2001). In light of Castillo’s determina\ntion that the machinegun provision in the previous version\nof §924 is an element, a change should not be inferred\n“[a]bsent a clear indication from Congress of a change in\npolicy.” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); see\nalso Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 313, n.\n12 (1994) (“[W]hen this Court construes a statute, it is\nexplaining its understanding of what the statute has\nmeant continuously since the date when it became law”).\n   The Government argues that the 1998 amendment\nrestructuring §924(c) demonstrates the congressional\njudgment to reclassify the machinegun provision as a\nsentencing factor, rather than as an offense element. But\nthe better understanding, as the Government acknowl\nedged in its submission in Castillo, is that “there is noth\ning to suggest that the 1998 amendments were intended to\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchange, rather than simply reorganize and clarify, [§924]’s\ntreatment of firearm type.” Brief for United States, O. T.\n1999, No. 99–658, p. 41. A closer review of the 1998\namendment confirms this.\n  There are three principal differences between the previ\nous and current versions of §924(c): two substantive\nchanges and a third regarding the stylistic structure of the\nstatute. The first difference, as discussed above, supra, at\n10, is that the amendment changed what were once man\ndatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences. A\nperson convicted of the primary offense of using or carry\ning a firearm during a crime of violence was once to “be\nsentenced to imprisonment for five years,” but under the\ncurrent version he or she is to “be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of not less than 5 years.”\n  The second difference is that the amended version in\ncludes the word “possesses” in addition to “uses or carries”\nin its principal paragraph, and then adds the substantive\nprovisions in §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which provide\nmandatory minimums for brandishing (7 years) and dis\ncharging (10 years) the firearm. These provisions are new\nsubstantive additions to the text of the previous version,\nwhich provided a bare 5-year mandatory minimum for any\noffender who “use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm,” without con\ncern for how the firearm was used.\n  The changes were a direct response to this Court’s deci\nsion in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), which\nheld that the word “use” in the pre-amendment version of\n§924 “must connote more than mere possession of a fire\narm by a person who commits a drug offense.” Id., at 143.\nThe Court in Bailey went on to observe that, “[h]ad Con\ngress intended possession alone to trigger liability under\n§924(c)(1), it easily could have so provided” by using the\nword “possess,” as it had so frequently done in other statu\ntory provisions. Ibid. Three years later, Congress made\nthe change and added the word “possesses” to the princi\n14               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npal paragraph. Congress additionally provided mandatory\nsentences above the 5-year minimum depending on\nwhether and how the firearm was used.               Sections\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) provide sentencing enhancements\nfor brandishing or discharging the firearm, and the Court\nhas held that these enhancements are sentencing factors\nto be found by a judge. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 552−556;\nsee also Dean v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 5) (referring to the brandishing and discharge\nprovisions as “sentencing factors”). The 1998 amendment\nwas colloquially known as the “Bailey Fix Act.” 144 Cong.\nRec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine); see also\nDean, supra, at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 3).\n   Aside from shifting the mandatory sentences to manda\ntory minimums, and this so-called Bailey fix, Congress left\nthe substance of the statute unchanged. Neither of these\nsubstantive changes suggests that Congress meant to\ntransform the machinegun provision from an element into\na sentencing factor.\n   The Government stresses a third, structural, difference\nin the statute, pointing out that the machinegun provision\nnow resides in a separate subsection, §924(c)(1)(B),\nwhereas it once resided in the principal paragraph that\nunmistakably lists offense elements. This structural or\nstylistic change, though, does not provide a “clear indica\ntion” that Congress meant to alter its treatment of ma\nchineguns as an offense element. See Grogan, 498 U. S.,\nat 290. A more logical explanation for the restructuring is\nthat it broke up a lengthy principal paragraph, which\nexceeded 250 words even before adding more to it for the\nBailey fix, into a more readable statute. This is in step\nwith current legislative drafting guidelines, which advise\ndrafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into sepa\nrate subsections that can be read more easily.

S., at 124−125, Harris, 536\nU. S., at 552−553, it has rejected the view that this struc\ntural consideration predominates even when other factors\npoint in the other direction, id., at 553 (“[E]ven if a statute\n‘has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsections\nare only sentencing provisions,’ ” the Court will not ignore\n“compelling evidence to the contrary” (quoting Jones, 526\nU. S., at 232)). For instance, in Jones the Court found that\nthe federal carjacking statute set forth elements of multi\nple offenses despite a structure similar to the statute at\nissue here. Id., at 232−239. And in Harris, the Court was\ncareful to point out that, unlike the case at bar, the other\nCastillo factors “reinforce[d] the single-offense interpreta\ntion implied by the statute’s structure.” 536 U. S., at 553.\n   In examining the amended version of §924(c)’s struc\nture, there is an additional consideration that supports\ninterpreting the machinegun provision to be an offense\nelement. As explained above, the brandishing and dis\ncharge provisions codified in §924(A)(ii) and (iii) do state\nsentencing factors. See Harris, supra, at 552−556; Dean,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). Had Congress intended to\ntreat firearm type as a sentencing factor, it likely would\nhave listed firearm types as clauses (iv) and (v) of sub\nparagraph (A), instead of as clauses (i) and (ii) of subpara\ngraph (B). By listing firearm type in stand-alone subpara\ngraph (B), Congress set it apart from the sentencing\nfactors in (A)(ii) and (iii); this is consistent with preserving\nfirearm type as an element of a separate offense.\n   To be sure, there are some arguments in favor of treat\ning the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor. The\n16                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ncurrent structure of §924(c) is more favorable to that\ninterpretation than was true in Castillo, particularly\nbecause the machinegun provision is now positioned be\ntween the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii),\nsee Harris, supra, at 552−556, and the recidivist provi\nsions in (C)(i) and (ii), which are typically sentencing\nfactors as well. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 230.\nThese points are overcome, however, by the substantial\nweight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that\nCongress would not enact so significant a change without\na clear indication of its purpose to do so. The evident\ncongressional purpose was to amend the statute to coun\nteract Bailey and to make the statute more readable but\nnot otherwise to alter the substance of the statute. The\nanalysis and holding of Castillo control this case.

As a historical matter, the term has described a fact\nthat a trial judge might rely upon when choosing a specific\nsentence within the range authorized by the legislature.\nIn that setting, the judge has broad discretion in deter\nmining both the significance of the factor and whether it\nhas been established by reliable evidence.\n   In the 1970’s and 1980’s, as part of a national effort to\nenact tougher sentences,1 a new type of “sentencing factor”\nemerged. Since then the term has been used to describe\nfacts, found by the judge by a preponderance of the evi\ndence, that have the effect of imposing mandatory limits\non a sentencing judge’s discretion. When used as an ele\nment of a mandatory sentencing scheme, a sentencing\nfactor is the functional equivalent of an element of the\n\n——————\n  1 “By 1990, forty-six states had enacted mandatory sentence en\n\nhancement laws, and most states had a wide variety of these provi\nsions.” Lowenthal, Mandatory Sentencing Laws: Undermining the\nEffectiveness of Determinate Sentencing Reform, 81 Cal.

In these circumstances, I continue\nto believe the Constitution requires proof beyond a rea\nsonable doubt of this “factor.”\n                             I\n   We first encountered the use of a “sentencing factor” in\nthe mandatory minimum context in McMillan v. Pennsyl\nvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), when we examined the consti\ntutionality of Pennsylvania’s 1982 Mandatory Minimum\nSentencing Act (Act).2 The Pennsylvania statute subjected\nanyone convicted of a specified felony to a mandatory\nminimum 5-year sentence if the trial judge found, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant “visibly\npossessed a firearm” during the commission of the offense.\nSee id., at 81–82. In four prosecutions under the Act, the\ntrial judges had each held that the statute was unconstitu\ntional and imposed sentences lower than the 5-year man\ndatory minimum, presumably because they recognized\nthat the statute treated the visible possession of a firearm\nas the functional equivalent of an offense element. Id., at\n82. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court consoli\ndated the four cases and reversed.3 Id., at 83. It reasoned\nthat because visible possession of a firearm was a mere\n“sentencing factor,” rather than an element of any of the\nspecified offenses defined by the legislature, the protec\ntions afforded by cases like In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358\n(1970),4 did not apply.\n   A bare majority of the McMillan Court endorsed this\n——————\n  2 See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 485 (2000) (“It was in\n\nMcMillan . . . that this Court, for the first time, coined the term ‘sen\ntencing factor’ to refer to a fact that was not found by a jury but that\ncould affect the sentence imposed by the judge”).\n  3 Commonwealth v.

Five Justices\nconcluded that the prerequisite for a mandatory sentence\nis just a “sentencing factor,” rather than an “element of\nthe offense,” because the factor does not “alte[r] the maxi\nmum penalty for the crime” and merely “limit[s] the sen\ntencing court’s discretion in selecting a penalty within the\nrange already available to it.” 477 U. S., at 87–88. Yet,\nalthough the Pennsylvania Act’s 5-year mandatory sen\ntence for visible possession of a firearm during the com\nmission of an offense did not exceed the statutory maxi\nmum that otherwise applied for the crimes of conviction, a\npositive finding on the so-called sentencing factor man\ndated the imposition of a sentence that exceeded the pun\nishment the defendant would have otherwise received.\nSee id., at 103–104 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n  The majority opinion in McMillan can fairly be de\nscribed as pathmarking, but unlike one of its predecessors,\nWinship, it pointed in the wrong direction. For reasons set\nforth in the opinions joined by the four dissenting Justices\nin McMillan, I continue to believe that McMillan was\nincorrectly decided. See id., at 93–94 (Marshall, J., dis\nsenting); id., at 95–104 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n                            II\n  Not only was McMillan wrong the day it was decided,\nbut its reasoning has been substantially undermined—if\nnot eviscerated—by the development of our Sixth Amend\nment jurisprudence in more recent years. We now under\nstand that “ ‘[i]t is unconstitutional [under the Sixth\nAmendment] for a legislature to remove from the jury the\nassessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of\npenalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting\nJones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 252–253 (1999)\n(STEVENS, J., concurring)). Harmonizing Apprendi with\nour existing Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, we ex\n4                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nplained that “any fact that increases the penalty for a\ncrime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added). In other\nwords, we narrowed our holding to those facts that effec\ntively raised the ceiling on the offense, but did not then\nconsider whether the logic of our holding applied also\nto those facts necessary to set the floor of a particular\nsentence.\n   As JUSTICE THOMAS eloquently explained in his dissent\nin Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 572 (2002), the\nreasoning in our decision in Apprendi applies with equal\nforce in the context of mandatory minimums. There is,\nquite simply, no reason to distinguish between facts that\ntrigger punishment in excess of the statutory maximum\nand facts that trigger a mandatory minimum. This case\nvividly illustrates the point. It is quite plain that there is\na world of difference between the 81⁄2-year sentence and\nthe 7-year sentence the judge imposed on the defendants\nin this case and the 30-year sentence mandated by the\nmachinegun finding under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(B).\n   Mandatory minimums may have a particularly acute\npractical effect in this type of statutory scheme which\ncontains an implied statutory maximum of life, see ante,\nat 10. There is, in this type of case, no ceiling; there is\nonly a floor below which a sentence cannot fall. Further\nmore, absent a positive finding on one of §924(c)(1)’s enu\nmerated factors, it is quite clear that no judge would\nimpose a sentence as great as the sentences commanded\nby the provision at issue in this case. Indeed, it appears\nthat, but for those subject to the 30-year mandatory mini\nmum, no defendant has ever been sentenced to a sentence\nanywhere near 30 years for a §924(c) offense. See Brief for\nRespondent O’Brien 46–47, and n. 15.\n   Apprendi should have signaled the end of McMillan,\njust as it signaled the unconstitutionality of state and\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S., at 569–\n570 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (“I cannot easily distinguish Apprendi . . . from\nthis case in terms of logic. For that reason, I cannot agree\nwith the plurality’s opinion insofar as it finds such a dis\ntinction. At the same time . . . I cannot yet accept [Ap\nprendi’s] rule”). It appears, however, that the reluctant\nApprendi dissenter may no longer be reluctant.6\n  I am therefore in full agreement with JUSTICE THOMAS’\nseparate writing today, post, at 1–2, as I was with his\nHarris dissent. McMillan and Harris should be overruled,\nat least to the extent that they authorize judicial factfind\ning on a preponderance of the evidence standard of facts\nthat “expos[e] a defendant to [a] greater punishment than\nwhat is otherwise legally prescribed . . .” Harris, 536\nU. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Any such fact is the\nfunctional equivalent of an element of the offense.\n\n——————\n  5 Consistent with the attempt in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.\n\n545 (2002), to distinguish Apprendi, JUSTICE KENNEDY’s fine opinion for\nthe Court today employs some of the same acrobatics to distinguish\nHarris from the present case. Harris also involved §924(c)(1), though a\ndifferent subsection; its reading of the mandatory minimum for “bran\ndishing” a firearm contained in 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) as a sentencing\nfactor is not so easily distinguished from the nearly identical manda\ntory minimum for possessing a “machinegun” under §924(c)(1)(B).\n  6 “But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory\n\nminimums, but I don’t accept Apprendi. Well, at some point I guess I\nhave to accept Apprendi, because it’s the law and has been for some\ntime. So if . . . if that should become an issue about whether mandatory\nminimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi purposes,\nshould we reset the case for argument?” Tr. of Oral Arg. 20 (question\nby BREYER, J.).\n6               UNITED STATES v.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), this\nCourt held that “ ‘[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,\nany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the\nprescribed statutory maximum,’ whether the statute calls\nit an element or a sentencing factor, ‘must be submitted to\na jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,’ ” id., at 550\n(quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490\n(2000)). I continue to believe that this constitutional\nrequirement applies to sentencing facts that, like the\nmachinegun enhancement at issue here, 18 U. S. C.\n§924(c)(1)(B)(ii), “alte[r] the [defendant’s] statutorily\nmandated sentencing range, by increasing the mandatory\nminimum sentence,” regardless of whether they alter the\nstatutory maximum penalty, Harris, 536 U. S., at 577\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); see id., at 577–578 (“As a matter\nof common sense, an increased mandatory minimum\nheightens the loss of liberty and represents the increased\nstigma society attaches to the offense. Consequently, facts\nthat trigger an increased mandatory minimum sentence\nwarrant constitutional safeguards”).\n   In my view, it makes no difference whether the sentenc\ning fact “vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen\ntence” by many years, ante, at 10, or only “ ‘incremental[ly]\nchanges’ ” it by a few, ibid. (quoting Harris, supra, at 554).\n2                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nNor does it make a difference whether the sentencing fact\n“involve[s]    characteristics     of   the     offender”    or\n“[c]haracteristics of the offense,” ante, at 8, or which direc\ntion the other factors in the Court’s five-factor test may\ntilt. One question decides the matter: If a sentencing fact\neither “raises the floor or raises the ceiling” of the range of\npunishments to which a defendant is exposed, it is, “ ‘by\ndefinition [an] “elemen[t].” ’ ” Harris, supra, at 579\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483,\nn. 10).\n   Without a finding that a defendant used a machinegun,\nthe penalty range for a conviction under §924(c)(1)(A)(i) is\nfive years to life imprisonment. But once that finding is\nadded, the penalty range becomes harsher—30 years to\nlife imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)—thus “expos[ing] a\ndefendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise\nlegally prescribed,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). As a consequence, “it is ultimately beside the\npoint whether as a matter of statutory interpretation [the\nmachinegun enhancement] is a sentencing factor.” Id., at\n576. “[A]s a constitutional matter,” because it establishes\na harsher range of punishments, it must be treated as an\nelement of a separate, aggravated offense that is submit\nted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Argued February 23, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nRespondents O’Brien and Burgess each carried a firearm during an\n  attempted robbery. Count three of their indictment charged them\n  with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, which car\n  ries a mandatory minimum 5-year prison term.                18 U. S. C.\n  §924(c)(1)(A)(i). Count four alleged use of a machinegun (here, a pis\n  tol that authorities believed operated as a fully automatic firearm) in\n  furtherance of that crime, which carries a 30-year mandatory mini\n  mum term. §924(c)(1)(B)(ii). The Government moved to dismiss the\n  fourth count on the basis that it could not establish the count beyond\n  a reasonable doubt, but it maintained that §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)’s ma\n  chinegun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be determined\n  by the District Court upon a conviction on count three. The court\n  dismissed count four and rejected the Government’s sentencing\n  enhancement position. Respondents then pleaded guilty to the re\n  maining counts. The court sentenced O’Brien to a 102-month term\n  and Burgess to an 84-month term for their §924(c) convictions. In af\n  firming the District Court’s §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) ruling, the First Circuit\n  looked primarily to Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, which\n  held that the machinegun provision in an earlier version of §924(c)\n  constituted an element of an offense, not a sentencing factor. The\n  court found that Castillo was “close to binding,” absent clearer or\n  more dramatic changes than those made by Congress’ 1998 amend\n  ment of §924(c) or a clearer legislative history.\nHeld: The fact that a firearm was a machinegun is an element to be\n proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, not a sentencing factor\n to be proved to the judge at sentencing. Pp. 5–16.\n    (a) Generally, a fact that “increase[s] the prescribed range of penal\n ties to which a criminal defendant is exposed” is an element of a\n2                      UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, to be charged in\n    an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Ham\n    ling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117, rather than proved to a judge\n    at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence, McMillan v. Penn\n    sylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92. Subject to this constitutional con\n    straint, Congress determines whether a factor is an element or a sen\n    tencing factor. When Congress is not explicit, courts look to a\n    statute’s provisions and framework for guidance. Analysis of the cur\n    rent machinegun provision begins with Castillo, where the Court\n    found the bare language of §924’s prior version “neutral,” 530 U. S.,\n    at 124, but ruled that four factors—(1) language and structure, (2)\n    tradition, (3) risk of unfairness, and (4) severity of the sentence—\n    favored treating the machinegun provision as an element of an of\n    fense, id., at 124−131; while a fifth factor—legislative history—did\n    not favor either side, ibid. Pp. 5–6.\n       (b) As relevant here, the 1998 amendment divided what was once a\n    lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs. Thus, with\n    regard to the first Castillo factor, the Court’s observation that “Con\n    gress placed the element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma\n    chinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or sepa\n    rated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no longer holds true.\n    However, the amendment did not affect the second through fifth Cas\n    tillo factors. Each of them, except for legislative history (which re\n    mains relatively silent), continues to favor treating the machinegun\n    provision as an element. The amendment’s effect on the language\n    and structure factor requires closer examination. Pp. 6–12.\n       (c) Given the Court’s determination in Castillo that the machine\n    gun provision in §924’s prior version is an element, a substantive\n    change in the statute should not be inferred “[a]bsent a clear indica\n    tion from Congress of a change in policy,” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S.\n    279, 290. Nothing in the 1998 amendment indicates such a change.\n    There are three principal differences between the previous and cur\n    rent §924(c). The first, a substantive change, shifts what were once\n    mandatory 5-year and 30-year sentences to mandatory minimum\n    sentences. The second, also substantive—made in direct response to\n    the holding in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, that “uses or\n    carries” in §924’s preamendment version connotes “more than mere\n    possession,” id., at 143—adds “possesses” to the “uses or carries” lan\n    guage in §924(c)’s principal paragraph and provides sentencing en\n    hancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm,\n    §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which do state sentencing factors, Harris v.\n    United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552−556. Neither of these substantive\n    changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun\n    provision from an element into a sentencing factor. The third differ\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ence is the machinegun provision’s relocation from the principal\n  paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate\n  subsection, §924(c)(1)(B), but this structural or stylistic change pro\n  vides no “clear indication” that Congress meant to alter its treatment\n  of machineguns as an offense element. A more logical explanation is\n  that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal\n  paragraph, which exceeded 250 words, into a more readable statute,\n  which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines. While\n  this Court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections\n  is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentenc\n  ing factors rather than elements, Castillo, supra, at 124−125, it has\n  rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates\n  even when other factors point in the other direction, Harris, supra, at\n  553. The current structure of §924(c) is more favorable to treating\n  the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in\n  Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now posi\n  tioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii) and\n  those in (C)(i) and (ii). This structural point is overcome by the sub\n  stantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that\n  Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear in\n  dication of its purpose to do so.

This provision prohibits the\nuse or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of vio\nlence or drug trafficking crime, or the possession of a\nfirearm in furtherance of such crimes. §924(c)(1)(A). A\nviolation of the statute carries a mandatory minimum\nterm of five years’ imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(A)(i); but if\nthe firearm is a machinegun, the statute requires a 30\nyear mandatory minimum sentence, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii).\nWhether a firearm was used, carried, or possessed is, as\nall concede, an element of the offense. At issue here is\nwhether the fact that the firearm was a machinegun is an\nelement to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable\ndoubt or a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at\nsentencing.\n   In an earlier case the Court determined that an analo\ngous machinegun provision in a previous version of §924\nconstituted an element of an offense to be proved to the\njury. Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120 (2000). The\nCastillo decision, however, addressed the statute as it\n2               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nexisted before congressional amendments made in 1998.\nAnd in a case after Castillo, the brandishing provision in\nthe post-1998 version of §924 was held to provide a sen\ntencing factor, not an element of the offense. Harris v.\nUnited States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002). In light of the 1998\namendments and the Harris decision, the question of how\nto interpret §924’s machinegun provision is considered\nonce more in the instant case.\n                              I\n   On June 16, 2005, respondents Martin O’Brien and\nArthur Burgess attempted to rob an armored car making a\nscheduled delivery of cash to a bank. Along with a third\ncollaborator, respondents hid in a minivan and waited for\nthe armored car to make its stop. Each of the men carried\na firearm. Containing nearly $2 million and attended by\ntwo guards, the armored car arrived. A guard began to\nunload boxes of coins. The three men came out of the van\nand, while one of them brandished his weapon, they or\ndered the guards to get on the ground. One guard did so,\nbut the other ran to a nearby restaurant. The respondents\nabandoned the robbery and fled without taking any\nmoney. No shots were fired, and no one was injured.\n   Authorities apprehended respondents and recovered the\nthree firearms used during the attempted robbery. The\nfirearms were a semiautomatic Sig-Sauer pistol, an\nAK−47 semiautomatic rifle, and a Cobray pistol. The\nCobray pistol had been manufactured as, and had the\nexternal appearance of, a semiautomatic firearm. Accord\ning to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, though, it\noperated as a fully automatic weapon, apparently due to\nsome alteration of its original firing mechanism. Respon\ndents dispute whether the Cobray in fact did operate as a\nfully automatic weapon.\n   Respondents were indicted on multiple counts. Rele\nvant here are counts three and four, both of which charged\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenses under §924(c). Count three charged respondents\nwith using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,\nwhich carries a statutory minimum of five years’ impris\nonment. Count four charged respondents in more specific\nterms, alleging use of a machinegun (the Cobray) in fur\ntherance of a crime of violence, as proscribed by\n§§924(c)(1)(A) and (B)(ii). The latter provision mandates a\nminimum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment.\n   The Government moved to dismiss count four on the\nbasis that it would be unable to establish the count beyond\na reasonable doubt. (The issues in the present case do not\nrequire the Court to consider any contention that a defen\ndant who uses, carries, or possesses a firearm must be\naware of the weapon’s characteristics. This opinion ex\npresses no views on the point.)\n   The Government then maintained that the machinegun\nprovision in §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) was a sentencing factor, so\nthat, if respondents were convicted of carrying a firearm\nunder count three, the court could determine at sentencing\nthat the particular firearm was a machinegun, thus acti\nvating the 30-year mandatory minimum. The District\nCourt dismissed count four, as the Government requested,\nbut rejected the Government’s position that the machine\ngun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be deter\nmined by the court at sentencing once there was a convic\ntion on count three. It ruled that the machinegun\nprovision states an element of a crime. Thus, to invoke\nthe 30-year minimum sentence, the Government was\nrequired to charge in the indictment, and then prove to\nthe jury, that the Cobray was a machinegun.\n   At this point, after the District Court foreclosed the\npossibility of respondents’ facing a 30-year minimum,\nrespondents pleaded guilty to the remaining counts, in\ncluding count three. The      District   Court    sentenced\nO’Brien to a 102-month term for his §924(c) conviction, to\nrun consecutively with his sentence on two other counts.\n4                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nIt sentenced Burgess to an 84-month term for his §924(c)\nconviction, also to run consecutively to his sentence on the\nother charges. The Government appealed the District\nCourt’s ruling that the §924 machinegun provision consti\ntutes an element of an offense instead of a sentencing\nfactor.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\naffirmed. It looked primarily to Castillo, 530 U. S. 120,\nwhich held that the machinegun provision in an earlier\nversion of §924(c) constituted an element of an offense, not\na sentencing factor. The court noted that the statute\nunder consideration in Castillo had been revised by Con\ngress, “break[ing] what was a single run-on sentence into\nsubparagraphs,” and it acknowledged that the earlier\nrepealed version of the statute was “slightly more favor\nable to the [respondents] than the current version[,] but\nnot markedly so.” 542 F. 3d 921, 925 (2008). It found “no\nevidence that the breaking up of the sentence into the\npresent subdivisions or recasting of language was any\nthing more than a current trend—probably for ease of\nreading—to convert lengthy sentences in criminal statutes\ninto subsections in the fashion of the tax code.” Id., at\n926. The court concluded: “Absent a clearer or more dra\nmatic change in language or legislative history expressing\na specific intent to assign judge or jury functions, we think\nthat Castillo is close to binding,” and any reconsideration\nof the issue should be left to this Court. Ibid.; see also\nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,\n490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has\ndirect application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\nrejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Ap\npeals should follow the case which directly controls, leav\ning to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own\ndecisions”).\n   We granted certiorari. 557 U.

Hamling\nv. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974); Jones v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 227, 232 (1999). Sentencing factors, on\nthe other hand, can be proved to a judge at sentencing by\na preponderance of the evidence. See McMillan v. Penn\nsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92 (1986). Though one excep\ntion has been established, see Almendarez-Torres v.\nUnited States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998), “ ‘[i]t is unconsti\ntutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the\nassessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of\npenalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting\nJones, supra, at 252−253 (STEVENS, J., concurring)). In\nother words, while sentencing factors may guide or confine\na judge’s discretion in sentencing an offender “within the\nrange prescribed by statute,” Apprendi, supra, at 481,\njudge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maxi\nmum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based\npurely on the facts found by the jury.\n   Subject to this constitutional constraint, whether a\ngiven fact is an element of the crime itself or a sentencing\nfactor is a question for Congress. When Congress is not\nexplicit, as is often the case because it seldom directly\naddresses the distinction between sentencing factors and\nelements, courts look to the provisions and the framework\nof the statute to determine whether a fact is an element or\na sentencing factor. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 228. In\nexamining whether the machinegun provision in §924 is\nan element or a sentencing factor, the analysis must begin\nwith this Court’s previous examination of the question in\nCastillo.\n   In Castillo, the Court considered a prior version of §924,\nwhich provided:\n6                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n       “(c)(1) Whoever, during and in relation to any crime\n    of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or car\n    ries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\n    provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking\n    crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,\n    and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle [or a] short\n    barreled shotgun to imprisonment for ten years, and if\n    the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device,\n    or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muf\n    fler, to imprisonment for thirty years. . . .” 18 U. S. C.\n    §924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V).\nIn determining whether the machinegun provision in the\njust-quoted version of §924 constituted an element or a\nsentencing factor, the Court in Castillo observed that the\nbare statutory language was “neutral.” 530 U. S., at 124.\nIt examined five factors directed at determining congres\nsional intent: (1) language and structure, (2) tradition, (3)\nrisk of unfairness, (4) severity of the sentence, and (5)\nlegislative history. Id., at 124−131. The Court unani\nmously concluded that the machinegun provision provided\nan element of an offense, noting that the first four factors\nfavored treating it as such while legislative history did not\nsignificantly favor either side. Ibid.\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  Section 924(c) was amended to its current form in 1998.\nThe amendment had been enacted when the Court consid\nered Castillo, supra, at 125, but the pre-1998 version of\nthe statute was at issue there. The instant case concerns\nthe post-1998 (and current) version of the statute, which\nprovides:\n      “(A) Except to the extent that a greater minimum\n    sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or\n    by any other provision of law, any person who, during\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    and in relation to any crime of violence or drug traf\n    ficking crime . . . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in\n    furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm,\n    shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such\n    crime of violence or drug trafficking crime—\n       “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n    less than 5 years;\n       “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n       “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\n       “(B) If the firearm possessed by a person convicted\n    of a violation of this subsection—\n       “(i) is a short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun,\n    or semiautomatic assault weapon, the person shall be\n    sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than\n    10 years; or\n       “(ii) is a machinegun or a destructive device, or is\n    equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler,\n    the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprison\n    ment of not less than 30 years.” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)\n    (2006 ed.).\n  The 1998 amendment did make substantive changes to\nthe statute, to be discussed below; but for purposes of the\npresent case the most apparent effect of the amendment\nwas to divide what was once a lengthy principal sentence\ninto separate subparagraphs. This Court’s observation in\nconsidering the first Castillo factor, that “Congress placed\nthe element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma\nchinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes\nor separated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no\nlonger holds true. Aside from this new structure, however,\nthe 1998 amendment of §924 did nothing to affect the\nsecond through fifth Castillo factors. Each of the factors,\nexcept for legislative history (which, assuming its rele\n8                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvance, remains relatively silent), continues to favor the\nconclusion that the machinegun provision is an element of\nan offense.\n   Legal tradition and past congressional practice are the\nsecond Castillo factor. The factor is to be consulted when,\nas here, a statute’s text is unclear as to whether certain\nfacts constitute elements or sentencing factors. Sentenc\ning factors traditionally involve characteristics of the\noffender—such as recidivism, cooperation with law en\nforcement, or acceptance of responsibility. Id., at 126.\nCharacteristics of the offense itself are traditionally\ntreated as elements, and the use of a machinegun under\n§924(c) lies “closest to the heart of the crime at issue.” Id.,\nat 127. This is no less true today than it was 10 years ago\nin Castillo. Unsurprisingly, firearm type is treated as an\nelement in a number of statutes, as “numerous gun crimes\nmake substantive distinctions between weapons such as\npistols and machineguns.” Ibid.; see, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\n§§922(a)(4), 922(b)(4), and 922(o)(1).\n   The Government counters that this tradition or pattern\nhas evolved since the version of §924(c) under review in\nCastillo was enacted. The Government contends that the\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines altered the tradition by\ntreating the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor.\nBrief for United States 23 (citing United States Sentenc\ning Commission, Guidelines Manual §2K2.1(a)(5) (Nov.\n1998) (raising base offense level “if the offense involved a\nfirearm”)).\n   The argument is not persuasive. The Sentencing Re\nform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, establishing the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines, was enacted four years before the\nversion of §924 under review in Castillo, see Anti-Drug\nAbuse Act of 1988, §6460, 102 Stat. 4373. While the re\nsulting Guidelines were not effective until 1987, this was\nstill before the 1988 enactment of the statute at issue in\nCastillo, and 13 years before this Court’s conclusion in\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCastillo that firearm type is traditionally treated as an\noffense element. The Government cannot claim the bene\nfit of any shift in how the law traditionally treats firearm\ntype from the Guidelines, for that supposed shift would\nhave occurred before the 1988 version of §924 was en\nacted. The Guidelines were explicitly taken into account\nwhen this Court analyzed the traditions in Castillo. 530\nU. S., at 126 (discussing Federal Sentencing Guidelines in\ndetermining what traditionally qualifies as a sentencing\nfactor).\n   The third Castillo factor, potential unfairness, was\nunchanged by the restructuring of §924. The Court ex\nplained in Castillo that treating the machinegun provision\nas a sentencing factor “might unnecessarily produce a\nconflict between the judge and the jury” because “a jury\nmay well have to decide which of several weapons” a\ndefendant used. Id., at 128. The concern was that the\njudge may not know which weapon the jurors determined\na defendant used, and “a judge’s later, sentencing-related\ndecision that the defendant used the machinegun, rather\nthan, say, the pistol, might conflict with the jury’s belief\nthat he actively used the pistol.” Ibid. This same concern\narises under the current version of §924, where jurors\nmight have to determine which among several weapons a\ndefendant used, carried, or possessed in furtherance of a\ncrime.\n   The Government’s response, that permitting a judge to\nmake this finding would “streamlin[e] guilt-stage proceed\nings, without interfering with the accuracy of fact-finding,”\nBrief for United States 33, is unconvincing. It does not\naddress the particular unfairness concern expressed in\nCastillo, which was not alleviated by the restructuring of\n§924. And the Government does not suggest that it would\nbe subjected to any unfairness if the machinegun provision\ncontinues to be treated as an element.\n   The fourth Castillo factor, the severity of the sentence\n10               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naccompanying a finding that a defendant carried a ma\nchinegun under §924, was also unaffected by the statute’s\nrestructuring. A finding that a defendant carried a ma\nchinegun under §924, in contrast to some less dangerous\nfirearm, vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen\ntence from 5 to 30 years, Castillo, supra, at 131, or from 7\nto 30 years if, as in this case, the firearm was brandished,\n§924(c)(1)(A)(ii). This is not akin to the “incremental\nchanges in the minimum” that one would “expect to see in\nprovisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing\njudge’s consideration,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 554 (from 5\nyears to 7 years); it is a drastic, sixfold increase that\nstrongly suggests a separate substantive crime.\n   There is one substantive difference between the old and\nnew versions of §924 that might bear on this fourth factor.\nThe previous version of §924 provided mandatory sen\ntences: 5 years for using or carrying a firearm and 30\nyears if the firearm is a machinegun, for example. See\n§924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The current statute pro\nvides only mandatory minimums: not less than 5 years for\nusing or possessing a firearm; not less than 7 for brandish\ning it; and not less than 30 if the firearm is a machinegun.\n§§924(c)(1)(A)(i), (A)(ii), (B)(ii). The Government argues\nthat this difference is critical because a 30-year sentence\nis conceivable under the statute even without a finding\nthat the particular weapon is a machinegun. Brief for\nUnited States 25.\n   This is a distinction in theory, perhaps, but not in prac\ntice. Neither the Government nor any party or amicus has\nidentified a single defendant whose conviction under §924\nfor possessing or brandishing a nonspecific firearm led to a\nsentence approaching the 30-year sentence that is re\nquired when the firearm is a machinegun. Respondents\nadvise, without refutation, that most courts impose the\nmandatory minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment for bran\ndishing a nonspecific weapon and the longest sentence\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat has come to the litigants’ or the Court’s attention is\n14 years. Brief for Respondent O’Brien 46, 48 (citing\nUnited States v. Batts, 317 Fed. Appx. 329 (CA4 2009) (per\ncuriam)); see also Harris, supra, at 578 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). Indeed, in the instant case, Burgess received\nthe statutory minimum 7-year sentence, and O’Brien\nreceived only 18 months more than that. Once the ma\nchinegun enhancement was off the table, the Government\nitself did not seek anything approaching 30-year terms,\ninstead requesting 12-year terms for each respondent.\n   The immense danger posed by machineguns, the moral\ndepravity in choosing the weapon, and the substantial\nincrease in the minimum sentence provided by the statute\nsupport the conclusion that this prohibition is an element\nof the crime, not a sentencing factor. It is not likely that\nCongress intended to remove the indictment and jury trial\nprotections when it provided for such an extreme sentenc\ning increase. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 233 (“It is at best\nquestionable whether the specification of facts sufficient to\nincrease a penalty range by two-thirds, let alone from 15\nyears to life, was meant to carry none of the process safe\nguards that elements of an offense bring with them for a\ndefendant’s benefit”). Perhaps Congress was not con\ncerned with parsing the distinction between elements and\nsentencing factors, a matter more often discussed by the\ncourts when discussing the proper allocation of functions\nbetween judge and jury. Instead, it likely was more fo\ncused on deterring the crime by creating the mandatory\nminimum sentences. But the severity of the increase in\nthis case counsels in favor of finding that the prohibition is\nan element, at least absent some clear congressional indi\ncation to the contrary.\n   The fifth factor considered in Castillo was legislative\nhistory, and the Court there found it to be of little help.\n530 U. S., at 130 (“Insofar as this history may be relevant,\nhowever, it does not significantly help the Government”).\n12               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe 1998 amendment has its own legislative record, dis\ncussed below, but the parties accurately observe that it is\nsilent as to congressional consideration of the distinction\nbetween elements and sentencing factors. Brief for United\nStates 29; Brief for Respondent O’Brien 28−29. This\nsilence is not neutral, however, because as explained\nbelow, it tends to counsel against finding that Congress\nmade a substantive change to this statutory provision.\n   Four of the five factors the Court relied upon in Castillo\npoint in the same direction they did 10 years ago. How\nthe 1998 amendment affects the remaining factor—the\nprovision’s language and structure—requires closer\nexamination.\n                              B\n   In Castillo, the Court interpreted §924(c) in its original\nversion, though Congress had at that point already\namended the provision. Here, the applicable principle is\nthat Congress does not enact substantive changes sub\nsilentio. See Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB,\n531 U. S. 316, 323 (2001). In light of Castillo’s determina\ntion that the machinegun provision in the previous version\nof §924 is an element, a change should not be inferred\n“[a]bsent a clear indication from Congress of a change in\npolicy.” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); see\nalso Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 313, n.\n12 (1994) (“[W]hen this Court construes a statute, it is\nexplaining its understanding of what the statute has\nmeant continuously since the date when it became law”).\n   The Government argues that the 1998 amendment\nrestructuring §924(c) demonstrates the congressional\njudgment to reclassify the machinegun provision as a\nsentencing factor, rather than as an offense element. But\nthe better understanding, as the Government acknowl\nedged in its submission in Castillo, is that “there is noth\ning to suggest that the 1998 amendments were intended to\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchange, rather than simply reorganize and clarify, [§924]’s\ntreatment of firearm type.” Brief for United States, O. T.\n1999, No. 99–658, p. 41. A closer review of the 1998\namendment confirms this.\n  There are three principal differences between the previ\nous and current versions of §924(c): two substantive\nchanges and a third regarding the stylistic structure of the\nstatute. The first difference, as discussed above, supra, at\n10, is that the amendment changed what were once man\ndatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences. A\nperson convicted of the primary offense of using or carry\ning a firearm during a crime of violence was once to “be\nsentenced to imprisonment for five years,” but under the\ncurrent version he or she is to “be sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of not less than 5 years.”\n  The second difference is that the amended version in\ncludes the word “possesses” in addition to “uses or carries”\nin its principal paragraph, and then adds the substantive\nprovisions in §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which provide\nmandatory minimums for brandishing (7 years) and dis\ncharging (10 years) the firearm. These provisions are new\nsubstantive additions to the text of the previous version,\nwhich provided a bare 5-year mandatory minimum for any\noffender who “use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm,” without con\ncern for how the firearm was used.\n  The changes were a direct response to this Court’s deci\nsion in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), which\nheld that the word “use” in the pre-amendment version of\n§924 “must connote more than mere possession of a fire\narm by a person who commits a drug offense.” Id., at 143.\nThe Court in Bailey went on to observe that, “[h]ad Con\ngress intended possession alone to trigger liability under\n§924(c)(1), it easily could have so provided” by using the\nword “possess,” as it had so frequently done in other statu\ntory provisions. Ibid. Three years later, Congress made\nthe change and added the word “possesses” to the princi\n14               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npal paragraph. Congress additionally provided mandatory\nsentences above the 5-year minimum depending on\nwhether and how the firearm was used.               Sections\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) provide sentencing enhancements\nfor brandishing or discharging the firearm, and the Court\nhas held that these enhancements are sentencing factors\nto be found by a judge. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 552−556;\nsee also Dean v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 5) (referring to the brandishing and discharge\nprovisions as “sentencing factors”). The 1998 amendment\nwas colloquially known as the “Bailey Fix Act.” 144 Cong.\nRec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine); see also\nDean, supra, at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 3).\n   Aside from shifting the mandatory sentences to manda\ntory minimums, and this so-called Bailey fix, Congress left\nthe substance of the statute unchanged. Neither of these\nsubstantive changes suggests that Congress meant to\ntransform the machinegun provision from an element into\na sentencing factor.\n   The Government stresses a third, structural, difference\nin the statute, pointing out that the machinegun provision\nnow resides in a separate subsection, §924(c)(1)(B),\nwhereas it once resided in the principal paragraph that\nunmistakably lists offense elements. This structural or\nstylistic change, though, does not provide a “clear indica\ntion” that Congress meant to alter its treatment of ma\nchineguns as an offense element. See Grogan, 498 U. S.,\nat 290. A more logical explanation for the restructuring is\nthat it broke up a lengthy principal paragraph, which\nexceeded 250 words even before adding more to it for the\nBailey fix, into a more readable statute. This is in step\nwith current legislative drafting guidelines, which advise\ndrafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into sepa\nrate subsections that can be read more easily.

S. ____ (2010)             15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n104.1, §312, pp. 23−25 (1995); Senate Office of the Legisla\ntive Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual §112, pp. 10−11\n(1997).\n   While the Court has indicated that placing factors in\nseparate subsections is one way Congress might signal\nthat it is treating them as sentencing factors as opposed to\nelements, Castillo, 530 U. S., at 124−125, Harris, 536\nU. S., at 552−553, it has rejected the view that this struc\ntural consideration predominates even when other factors\npoint in the other direction, id., at 553 (“[E]ven if a statute\n‘has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsections\nare only sentencing provisions,’ ” the Court will not ignore\n“compelling evidence to the contrary” (quoting Jones, 526\nU. S., at 232)). For instance, in Jones the Court found that\nthe federal carjacking statute set forth elements of multi\nple offenses despite a structure similar to the statute at\nissue here. Id., at 232−239. And in Harris, the Court was\ncareful to point out that, unlike the case at bar, the other\nCastillo factors “reinforce[d] the single-offense interpreta\ntion implied by the statute’s structure.” 536 U. S., at 553.\n   In examining the amended version of §924(c)’s struc\nture, there is an additional consideration that supports\ninterpreting the machinegun provision to be an offense\nelement. As explained above, the brandishing and dis\ncharge provisions codified in §924(A)(ii) and (iii) do state\nsentencing factors. See Harris, supra, at 552−556; Dean,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). Had Congress intended to\ntreat firearm type as a sentencing factor, it likely would\nhave listed firearm types as clauses (iv) and (v) of sub\nparagraph (A), instead of as clauses (i) and (ii) of subpara\ngraph (B). By listing firearm type in stand-alone subpara\ngraph (B), Congress set it apart from the sentencing\nfactors in (A)(ii) and (iii); this is consistent with preserving\nfirearm type as an element of a separate offense.\n   To be sure, there are some arguments in favor of treat\ning the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor. The\n16                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ncurrent structure of §924(c) is more favorable to that\ninterpretation than was true in Castillo, particularly\nbecause the machinegun provision is now positioned be\ntween the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii),\nsee Harris, supra, at 552−556, and the recidivist provi\nsions in (C)(i) and (ii), which are typically sentencing\nfactors as well. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 230.\nThese points are overcome, however, by the substantial\nweight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that\nCongress would not enact so significant a change without\na clear indication of its purpose to do so. The evident\ncongressional purpose was to amend the statute to coun\nteract Bailey and to make the statute more readable but\nnot otherwise to alter the substance of the statute. The\nanalysis and holding of Castillo control this case.

Since then the term has been used to describe\nfacts, found by the judge by a preponderance of the evi\ndence, that have the effect of imposing mandatory limits\non a sentencing judge’s discretion.

Pennsyl\nvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), when we examined the consti\ntutionality of Pennsylvania’s 1982 Mandatory Minimum\nSentencing Act (Act).2 The Pennsylvania statute subjected\nanyone convicted of a specified felony to a mandatory\nminimum 5-year sentence if the trial judge found, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant “visibly\npossessed a firearm” during the commission of the offense.\nSee id., at 81–82. In four prosecutions under the Act, the\ntrial judges had each held that the statute was unconstitu\ntional and imposed sentences lower than the 5-year man\ndatory minimum, presumably because they recognized\nthat the statute treated the visible possession of a firearm\nas the functional equivalent of an offense element. Id., at\n82. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court consoli\ndated the four cases and reversed.3 Id., at 83. It reasoned\nthat because visible possession of a firearm was a mere\n“sentencing factor,” rather than an element of any of the\nspecified offenses defined by the legislature, the protec\ntions afforded by cases like In re Winship, 397 U.

S. 466, 485 (2000) (“It was in\n\nMcMillan . . . that this Court, for the first time, coined the term ‘sen\ntencing factor’ to refer to a fact that was not found by a jury but that\ncould affect the sentence imposed by the judge”).\n  3 Commonwealth v. Wright, 508 Pa. 25, 494 A. 2d 354 (1985).\n  4 In Winship, the Court “explicitly” held that “the Due Process Clause\n\nprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with\nwhich he is charged.” 397 U. S., at 364.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nnovel use of the sentencing factor concept. Five Justices\nconcluded that the prerequisite for a mandatory sentence\nis just a “sentencing factor,” rather than an “element of\nthe offense,” because the factor does not “alte[r] the maxi\nmum penalty for the crime” and merely “limit[s] the sen\ntencing court’s discretion in selecting a penalty within the\nrange already available to it.” 477 U. S., at 87–88. Yet,\nalthough the Pennsylvania Act’s 5-year mandatory sen\ntence for visible possession of a firearm during the com\nmission of an offense did not exceed the statutory maxi\nmum that otherwise applied for the crimes of conviction, a\npositive finding on the so-called sentencing factor man\ndated the imposition of a sentence that exceeded the pun\nishment the defendant would have otherwise received.\nSee id., at 103–104 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n  The majority opinion in McMillan can fairly be de\nscribed as pathmarking, but unlike one of its predecessors,\nWinship, it pointed in the wrong direction. For reasons set\nforth in the opinions joined by the four dissenting Justices\nin McMillan, I continue to believe that McMillan was\nincorrectly decided. See id., at 93–94 (Marshall, J., dis\nsenting); id., at 95–104 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n                            II\n  Not only was McMillan wrong the day it was decided,\nbut its reasoning has been substantially undermined—if\nnot eviscerated—by the development of our Sixth Amend\nment jurisprudence in more recent years. We now under\nstand that “ ‘[i]t is unconstitutional [under the Sixth\nAmendment] for a legislature to remove from the jury the\nassessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of\npenalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting\nJones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 252–253 (1999)\n(STEVENS, J., concurring)). Harmonizing Apprendi with\nour existing Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, we ex\n4                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nplained that “any fact that increases the penalty for a\ncrime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added). In other\nwords, we narrowed our holding to those facts that effec\ntively raised the ceiling on the offense, but did not then\nconsider whether the logic of our holding applied also\nto those facts necessary to set the floor of a particular\nsentence.\n   As JUSTICE THOMAS eloquently explained in his dissent\nin Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 572 (2002), the\nreasoning in our decision in Apprendi applies with equal\nforce in the context of mandatory minimums. There is,\nquite simply, no reason to distinguish between facts that\ntrigger punishment in excess of the statutory maximum\nand facts that trigger a mandatory minimum. This case\nvividly illustrates the point. It is quite plain that there is\na world of difference between the 81⁄2-year sentence and\nthe 7-year sentence the judge imposed on the defendants\nin this case and the 30-year sentence mandated by the\nmachinegun finding under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(B).\n   Mandatory minimums may have a particularly acute\npractical effect in this type of statutory scheme which\ncontains an implied statutory maximum of life, see ante,\nat 10. There is, in this type of case, no ceiling; there is\nonly a floor below which a sentence cannot fall. Further\nmore, absent a positive finding on one of §924(c)(1)’s enu\nmerated factors, it is quite clear that no judge would\nimpose a sentence as great as the sentences commanded\nby the provision at issue in this case. Indeed, it appears\nthat, but for those subject to the 30-year mandatory mini\nmum, no defendant has ever been sentenced to a sentence\nanywhere near 30 years for a §924(c) offense. See Brief for\nRespondent O’Brien 46–47, and n. 15.\n   Apprendi should have signaled the end of McMillan,\njust as it signaled the unconstitutionality of state and\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

But thanks to an unpersua\nsive attempt to distinguish Apprendi,5 and a reluctant\nApprendi dissenter, McMillan survived over the protest of\nfour Members of the Court. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 569–\n570 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (“I cannot easily distinguish Apprendi . . . from\nthis case in terms of logic. For that reason, I cannot agree\nwith the plurality’s opinion insofar as it finds such a dis\ntinction. At the same time . . . I cannot yet accept [Ap\nprendi’s] rule”). It appears, however, that the reluctant\nApprendi dissenter may no longer be reluctant.6\n  I am therefore in full agreement with JUSTICE THOMAS’\nseparate writing today, post, at 1–2, as I was with his\nHarris dissent. McMillan and Harris should be overruled,\nat least to the extent that they authorize judicial factfind\ning on a preponderance of the evidence standard of facts\nthat “expos[e] a defendant to [a] greater punishment than\nwhat is otherwise legally prescribed . . .” Harris, 536\nU. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Any such fact is the\nfunctional equivalent of an element of the offense.\n\n——————\n  5 Consistent with the attempt in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.\n\n545 (2002), to distinguish Apprendi, JUSTICE KENNEDY’s fine opinion for\nthe Court today employs some of the same acrobatics to distinguish\nHarris from the present case. Harris also involved §924(c)(1), though a\ndifferent subsection; its reading of the mandatory minimum for “bran\ndishing” a firearm contained in 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) as a sentencing\nfactor is not so easily distinguished from the nearly identical manda\ntory minimum for possessing a “machinegun” under §924(c)(1)(B).\n  6 “But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory\n\nminimums, but I don’t accept Apprendi. Well, at some point I guess I\nhave to accept Apprendi, because it’s the law and has been for some\ntime. So if . . . if that should become an issue about whether mandatory\nminimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi purposes,\nshould we reset the case for argument?” Tr. of Oral Arg. 20 (question\nby BREYER, J.).\n6               UNITED STATES v.

The unanimity of\nour decision today does not imply that McMillan is safe\nfrom a direct challenge to its foundation.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), this\nCourt held that “ ‘[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,\nany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the\nprescribed statutory maximum,’ whether the statute calls\nit an element or a sentencing factor, ‘must be submitted to\na jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,’ ” id., at 550\n(quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490\n(2000)). I continue to believe that this constitutional\nrequirement applies to sentencing facts that, like the\nmachinegun enhancement at issue here, 18 U. S. C.\n§924(c)(1)(B)(ii), “alte[r] the [defendant’s] statutorily\nmandated sentencing range, by increasing the mandatory\nminimum sentence,” regardless of whether they alter the\nstatutory maximum penalty, Harris, 536 U. S., at 577\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting); see id., at 577–578 (“As a matter\nof common sense, an increased mandatory minimum\nheightens the loss of liberty and represents the increased\nstigma society attaches to the offense. Consequently, facts\nthat trigger an increased mandatory minimum sentence\nwarrant constitutional safeguards”).\n   In my view, it makes no difference whether the sentenc\ning fact “vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen\ntence” by many years, ante, at 10, or only “ ‘incremental[ly]\nchanges’ ” it by a few, ibid. (quoting Harris, supra, at 554).\n2                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nNor does it make a difference whether the sentencing fact\n“involve[s]    characteristics     of   the     offender”    or\n“[c]haracteristics of the offense,” ante, at 8, or which direc\ntion the other factors in the Court’s five-factor test may\ntilt. One question decides the matter: If a sentencing fact\neither “raises the floor or raises the ceiling” of the range of\npunishments to which a defendant is exposed, it is, “ ‘by\ndefinition [an] “elemen[t].” ’ ” Harris, supra, at 579\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483,\nn. 10).\n   Without a finding that a defendant used a machinegun,\nthe penalty range for a conviction under §924(c)(1)(A)(i) is\nfive years to life imprisonment. But once that finding is\nadded, the penalty range becomes harsher—30 years to\nlife imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)—thus “expos[ing] a\ndefendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise\nlegally prescribed,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 579 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). As a consequence, “it is ultimately beside the\npoint whether as a matter of statutory interpretation [the\nmachinegun enhancement] is a sentencing factor.” Id., at\n576. “[A]s a constitutional matter,” because it establishes\na harsher range of punishments, it must be treated as an\nelement of a separate, aggravated offense that is submit\nted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ibid.\n   Because the Court reaches this same conclusion based\non its analysis of a five-factor test, see ante, at 6–16, I\nconcur in the judgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/146984/", "sha1": "88212b96b052fb25aec595779603e68f9769b67a", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2009-054", "time_retrieved": "2010-05-24T07:36:18"}
