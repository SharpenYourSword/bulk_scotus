NATIONAL FOOTBALL\n\n              LEAGUE ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08–661.      Argued January 13, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nRespondent National Football League (NFL) is an unincorporated asso\n  ciation of 32 separately owned professional football teams, also re\n  spondents here. The teams, each of which owns its own name, colors,\n  logo, trademarks, and related intellectual property, formed respon\n  dent National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license,\n  and market that property. At first, NFLP granted nonexclusive li\n  censes to petitioner and other vendors to manufacture and sell team\n  labeled apparel. In December 2000, however, the teams authorized\n  NFLP to grant exclusive licenses. NFLP granted an exclusive license\n  to respondent Reebok International Ltd. to produce and sell trade\n  marked headwear for all 32 teams. When petitioner’s license was not\n  renewed, it filed this action alleging that the agreements between re\n  spondents violated the Sherman Act, §1 of which makes “[e]very con\n  tract, combination . . . or, conspiracy, in restraint of trade” illegal.\n  Respondents answered that they were incapable of conspiring within\n  §1’s meaning because the NFL and its teams are, in antitrust law\n  jargon, a single entity with respect to the conduct challenged. The\n  District Court granted respondents summary judgment, and the Sev\n  enth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The alleged conduct related to licensing of intellectual property\n constitutes concerted action that is not categorically beyond §1’s cov\n erage. Pp. 4–20.\n    (a) The meaning of “contract, combination . . . , or, conspiracy” in §1\n of the Sherman Act is informed by the Act’s “ ‘basic distinction be\n tween concerted and independent action.’ ” Copperweld Corp. v. In\n dependence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 767. Section 1 “treat[s] con\n certed behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior,” id., at 768,\n2               AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL \n\n                       FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                       \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    because, unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity inherently is\n    fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as it “deprives the market\n    place of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition as\n    sumes and demands,” id., at 768–769. And because concerted action\n    is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a\n    vast amount of business conduct. That creates less risk of deterring\n    a firm’s necessary conduct and leaves courts to examine only discrete\n    agreements. An arrangement must therefore embody concerted ac\n    tion in order to be a “contract, combination . . . or, conspiracy” under\n    §1. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) In determining whether there is concerted action under §1, the\n    Court has eschewed formalistic distinctions, such as whether the al\n    leged conspirators are legally distinct entities, in favor of a functional\n    consideration of how they actually operate. The Court has repeatedly\n    found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated\n    §1 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and\n    served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity. See,\n    e.g., United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350, 352–356. Conversely,\n    the Court has found that although the entities may be “separate” for\n    purposes of incorporation or formal title, if they are controlled by a\n    single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation\n    of economic power, an agreement between them does not constitute a\n    “contract, combination . . . or, conspiracy.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at\n    769. Pp. 6–10.\n       (c) The relevant inquiry is therefore one of substance, not form,\n    which does not turn on whether the alleged parties to contract, com\n    bination, or conspiracy are part of a legally single entity or seem like\n    one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The inquiry is\n    whether the agreement in question joins together “separate economic\n    actors pursuing separate economic interests,” Copperweld, 467 U. S.,\n    at 768, such that it “deprives the marketplace of independent centers\n    of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, and therefore of diversity of entrepre\n    neurial interests and thus of actual or potential competition. If it\n    does, then there is concerted action covered by §1, and the court must\n    decide whether the restraint of trade is unreasonable and therefore\n    illegal. Pp. 10–11.\n       (d) The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmak\n    ing quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic\n    of independent action. Each of them is a substantial, independently\n    owned, independently managed business, whose “general corporate\n    actions are guided or determined” by “separate corporate conscious\n    nesses,” and whose “objectives are” not “common.” Copperweld, 467\n    U. S., at 771. They compete with one another, not only on the play\n    ing field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts, and for contracts with\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  managerial and playing personnel. See, e.g., Brown v. Pro Football,\n  Inc., 518 U. S. 231, 249. Directly relevant here, the teams are poten\n  tially competing suppliers in the market for intellectual property.\n  When teams license such property, they are not pursuing the “com\n  mon interests of the whole” league, but, instead, the interests of each\n  “corporation itself.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 770. It is not disposi\n  tive, as respondents argue, that, by forming NFLP, they have formed\n  a single entity, akin to a merger, and market their NFL brands\n  through a single outlet. Although the NFL respondents may be simi\n  lar in some sense to a single enterprise, they are not similar in the\n  relevant functional sense. While teams have common interests such\n  as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit\n  maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trade\n  marks are not necessarily aligned. Nor does it matter that the teams\n  may find the alleged cooperation necessary to compete against other\n  forms of entertainment. Although decisions made by NFLP are not\n  as easily classified as concerted activity, the NFLP’s decisions about\n  licensing the teams’ separately owned intellectual property are con\n  certed activity and thus covered by §1 for the same reason that deci\n  sions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by §1. In making the\n  relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is “an instrumentality” of the\n  teams. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354. Pp. 11–17.\n     (e) Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by anti\n  trust law. The fact that the NFL teams share an interest in making\n  the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must coop\n  erate to produce games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for\n  making a host of collective decisions. Because some of these re\n  straints on competition are necessary to produce the NFL’s product,\n  the Rule of Reason generally should apply, and teams’ cooperation is\n  likely to be permissible. And depending upon the activity in ques\n  tion, the Rule of Reason can at times be applied without detailed\n  analysis. But the activity at issue in this case is still concerted activ\n  ity covered for §1 purposes.

S. C. §1. The question whether an ar­\nrangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is\ndifferent from and antecedent to the question whether it\nunreasonably restrains trade. This case raises that ante­\ncedent question about the business of the 32 teams in the\nNational Football League (NFL) and a corporate entity\nthat they formed to manage their intellectual property.\nWe conclude that the NFL’s licensing activities constitute\nconcerted action that is not categorically beyond the cov­\nerage of §1. The legality of that concerted action must be\njudged under the Rule of Reason.\n                              I\n  Originally organized in 1920, the NFL is an unincorpo­\nrated association that now includes 32 separately owned\nprofessional football teams.1 Each team has its own name,\n——————\n 1 The   NFL was founded in Canton, Ohio as the “American Profes­\n2            AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL \n\n                    FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                       \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncolors, and logo, and owns related intellectual property.\nLike each of the other teams in the league, the New Or­\nleans Saints and the Indianapolis Colts, for example, have\ntheir own distinctive names, colors, and marks that are\nwell known to millions of sports fans.\n   Prior to 1963, the teams made their own arrangements\nfor licensing their intellectual property and marketing\ntrademarked items such as caps and jerseys. In 1963, the\nteams formed National Football League Properties (NFLP)\nto develop, license, and market their intellectual property.\nMost, but not all, of the substantial revenues generated by\nNFLP have either been given to charity or shared equally\namong the teams. However, the teams are able to and\nhave at times sought to withdraw from this arrangement.\n   Between 1963 and 2000, NFLP granted nonexclusive\nlicenses to a number of vendors, permitting them to manu­\nfacture and sell apparel bearing team insignias. Peti­\ntioner, American Needle, Inc., was one of those licensees.\nIn December 2000, the teams voted to authorize NFLP to\ngrant exclusive licenses, and NFLP granted Reebok Inter­\nnational Ltd. an exclusive 10-year license to manufacture\nand sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams. It there­\nafter declined to renew American Needle’s nonexclusive\nlicense.\n   American Needle filed this action in the Northern Dis­\ntrict of Illinois, alleging that the agreements between the\nNFL, its teams, NFLP, and Reebok violated §§1 and 2 of\nthe Sherman Act. In their answer to the complaint, the\ndefendants averred that the teams, NFL, and NFLP were\nincapable of conspiring within the meaning of §1 “because\nthey are a single economic enterprise, at least with respect\n\n——————\nsional Football Association.” United States Football League v.

After limited discov­\nery, the District Court granted summary judgment on the\nquestion “whether, with regard to the facet of their opera­\ntions respecting exploitation of intellectual property\nrights, the NFL and its 32 teams are, in the jargon of\nantitrust law, acting as a single entity.” American Needle,\nInc. v. New Orleans La. Saints, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2350127\"><a href=\"/opinion/2350127/american-needle-v-new-orleans-louisiana-saints/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 943\n(2007). The court concluded “that in that facet of their\noperations they have so integrated their operations that\nthey should be deemed a single entity rather than joint\nventures cooperating for a common purpose.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nThe panel observed that “in some contexts, a league seems\nmore aptly described as a single entity immune from\nantitrust scrutiny, while in others a league appears to be a\njoint venture between independently owned teams that is\nsubject to review under §1.” 538 F. 3d, 736, 741 (2008).\nRelying on Circuit precedent, the court limited its inquiry\nto the particular conduct at issue, licensing of teams’\nintellectual property. The panel agreed with petitioner\nthat “when making a single-entity determination, courts\nmust examine whether the conduct in question deprives\nthe marketplace of the independent sources of economic\ncontrol that competition assumes.” Id., at 742. The court,\nhowever, discounted the significance of potential competi­\ntion among the teams regarding the use of their intellec­\ntual property because the teams “can function only as one\nsource of economic power when collectively producing NFL\nfootball.” Id., at 743. The court noted that football itself\ncan only be carried out jointly. See ibid. (“Asserting that\na single football team could produce a football game . . . is\na Zen riddle: Who wins when a football team plays itself ”).\nMoreover, “NFL teams share a vital economic interest in\ncollectively promoting NFL football . . . [to] compet[e] with\nother forms of entertainment.” Ibid. “It thus follows,” the\ncourt found, “that only one source of economic power con­\n4           AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

Recognizing that NFL teams\nhave “license[d] their intellectual property collectively”\nsince 1963, the court held that §1 did not apply. Id., at\n744.\n   We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __ (2009).\n                              II\n   As the case comes to us, we have only a narrow issue to\ndecide: whether the NFL respondents are capable of en­\ngaging in a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” as\ndefined by §1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §1, or, as we\nhave sometimes phrased it, whether the alleged activity\nby the NFL respondents “must be viewed as that of a\nsingle enterprise for purposes of §1.” Copperweld Corp. v.\nIndependence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 771 (1984).\n   Taken literally, the applicability of §1 to “every contract,\ncombination . . . or conspiracy” could be understood to\ncover every conceivable agreement, whether it be a group\nof competing firms fixing prices or a single firm’s chief\nexecutive telling her subordinate how to price their com­\npany’s product. But even though, “read literally,” §1\nwould address “the entire body of private contract,” that is\nnot what the statute means. National Soc. of Professional\nEngineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 688 (1978); see\nalso Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U. S. 1, 5 (2006) (“This\nCourt has not taken a literal approach to this language”);\ncf. Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S.\n231, 238 (1918) (reasoning that the term “restraint of\ntrade” in §1 cannot possibly refer to any restraint on com­\npetition because “[e]very agreement concerning trade,\nevery regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain,\nis of their very essence”). Not every instance of co-\noperation between two people is a potential “contract,\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)               5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncombination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.” 15\nU. S. C. §1.\n   The meaning of the term “contract, combination . . . or\nconspiracy” is informed by the “ ‘basic distinction’ ” in the\nSherman Act “ ‘between concerted and independent ac­\ntion’ ” that distinguishes §1 of the Sherman Act from §2.\nCopperweld, 467 U. S., at 767 (quoting Monsanto Co. v.\nSpray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 761 (1984)).\nSection 1 applies only to concerted action that restrains\ntrade. Section 2, by contrast, covers both concerted and\nindependent action, but only if that action “monopolize[s],”\n15 U. S. C. §2, or “threatens actual monopolization,” Cop\nperweld, 467 U. S., at 767, a category that is narrower\nthan restraint of trade. Monopoly power may be equally\nharmful whether it is the product of joint action or indi­\nvidual action.\n   Congress used this distinction between concerted and\nindependent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and\ncompensate its victims, without chilling vigorous competi­\ntion through ordinary business operations. The distinc­\ntion also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine, internal busi­\nness decisions.\n   Thus, in §1 Congress “treated concerted behavior more\nstrictly than unilateral behavior.” Id., at 768. This is so\nbecause unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity\ninherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as\nit “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of\ndecisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.”\nId., at 768–769. And because concerted action is discrete\nand distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a\nvast amount of business conduct. As a result, there is less\nrisk of deterring a firm’s necessary conduct; courts need\nonly examine discrete agreements; and such conduct may\nbe remedied simply through prohibition.2 See Areeda &\n——————\n 2 If   Congress prohibited independent action that merely restrains\n6            AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL \n\n                    FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                   \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nHovenkamp ¶1464c, at 206. Concerted activity is thus\n“judged more sternly than unilateral activity under §2,”\nCopperweld, 467 U. S., at 768. For these reasons, §1\nprohibits any concerted action “in restraint of trade or\ncommerce,” even if the action does not “threate[n] monopo­\nlization,” Ibid. And therefore, an arrangement must\nembody concerted action in order to be a “contract, combi­\nnation . . . or conspiracy” under §1.\n                             III\n   We have long held that concerted action under §1 does\nnot turn simply on whether the parties involved are le­\ngally distinct entities. Instead, we have eschewed such\nformalistic distinctions in favor of a functional considera­\ntion of how the parties involved in the alleged anticom­\npetitive conduct actually operate.\n   As a result, we have repeatedly found instances in\nwhich members of a legally single entity violated §1 when\nthe entity was controlled by a group of competitors and\nserved, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted\nactivity. In United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350\n(1967), for example, a group of mattress manufacturers\noperated and controlled Sealy, Inc., a company that li­\ncensed the Sealy trademark to the manufacturers, and\n——————\ntrade (even if it does not threaten monopolization), that prohibition\ncould deter perfectly competitive conduct by firms that are fearful of\nlitigation costs and judicial error. See Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 768\n(“Judging unilateral conduct in this manner reduces the risk that the\nantitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive\ncompetitor”); cf. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S.\n422, 441 (1978) (“[S]alutary and procompetitive conduct . . . might be\nshunned by businessmen who chose to be excessively cautious in the\nface of uncertainty”). Moreover, if every unilateral action that re­\nstrained trade were subject to antitrust scrutiny, then courts would be\nforced to judge almost every internal business decision. See 7 P.\nAreeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶1464c, at 206 (2d ed. 2003)\n(hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp) (unilateral behavior is “often\ndifficult to evaluate or remedy”).\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

The Government alleged that the\nlicensees and Sealy were conspiring in violation of §1, and\nwe agreed. Id., at 352–354. We explained that “[w]e seek\nthe central substance of the situation” and therefore “we\nare moved by the identity of the persons who act, rather\nthan the label of their hats.” Id., at 353. We thus held\nthat Sealy was not a “separate entity, but . . . an instru­\nmentality of the individual manufacturers.” Id., at 356.\nIn similar circumstances, we have found other formally\ndistinct business organizations covered by §1. See, e.g.,\nNorthwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery\n& Printing Co., 472 U. S. 284 (1985); National Collegiate\nAthletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468\nU. S. 85 (1984) (NCAA); United States v. Topco Associates,\nInc., 405 U. S. 596, 609 (1972); Associated Press v. United\nStates, 326 U. S. 1 (1945); id., at 26 (Frankfurter, J., con­\ncurring); United States v. Terminal Railroad Assn. of St.\nLouis, 224 U. S. 383 (1912); see also Rock, Corporate Law\nThrough an Antitrust Lens, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 497, 506–\n510 (1992) (discussing cases). We have similarly looked\npast the form of a legally “single entity” when competitors\nwere part of professional organizations3 or trade groups.4\n   Conversely, there is not necessarily concerted action\nsimply because more than one legally distinct entity is\ninvolved. Although, under a now-defunct doctrine known\nas the “intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,” we once\ntreated cooperation between legally separate entities as\n——————\n  3 See, e.g., FTC v.

In United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S.\n218 (1947), we observed that “corporate interrelationships\n. . . are not determinitive of the applicability of the\nSherman Act” because the Act “is aimed at substance\nrather than form.” Id., at 227. We nonetheless held that\ncooperation between legally separate entities was neces­\nsarily covered by §1 because an unreasonable restraint of\ntrade “may result as readily from a conspiracy among\nthose who are affiliated or integrated under common\nownership as from a conspiracy among those who are\notherwise independent.” Ibid.; see also Kiefer-Stewart Co.\nv. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211, 215\n(1951).\n    The decline of the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine\nbegan in Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus\nProducts Co., 370 U. S. 19 (1962). In that case, several\nagricultural cooperatives that were owned by the same\nfarmers were sued for violations of §1 of the Sherman Act.\nId., at 24–25. Applying a specific immunity provision for\nagricultural cooperatives, we held that the three coopera­\ntives were “in practical effect” one “organization,” even\nthough the controlling farmers “have formally organized\nthemselves into three separate legal entities.” Id., at 29.\n“To hold otherwise,” we explained, “would be to impose\ngrave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions\nthat are of de minimis meaning and effect” insofar as “use\nof separate corporations had [no] economic significance.”\nIbid.\n    Next, in United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat.\nBank, 422 U. S. 86 (1975), a large bank, Citizens and\nSouthern (C&S), formed a holding company that operated\nde facto suburban branch banks in the Atlanta area\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough ownership of the maximum amount of stock in\neach local branch that was allowed by law, “ownership of\nmuch of the remaining stock by parties friendly to C&S,\nuse by the suburban banks of the C&S logogram and all of\nC&S’s banking services, and close C&S oversight of the\noperation and governance of the suburban banks.” Id., at\n89 (footnote omitted). The Government challenged the\ncooperation between the banks. In our analysis, we ob­\nserved that “ ‘corporate interrelationships . . . are not\ndeterminative,’ ” id., at 116, “looked to economic sub­\nstance,” and observed that “because the sponsored banks\nwere not set up to be competitors, §1 did not compel them\nto compete.” Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶1463, at 200–201;\nsee also Citizens & Southern, 422 U. S., at 119–120;\nAreeda, Intraenterprise Conspiracy in Decline, 97 Harv.\nL. Rev. 451, 461 (1983).\n  We finally reexamined the intraenterprise conspiracy\ndoctrine in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.,\n467 U. S. 752 (1984), and concluded that it was inconsis­\ntent with the “ ‘basic distinction between concerted and\nindependent action.’ ” Id., at 767. Considering it “per­\nfectly plain that an internal agreement to implement a\nsingle, unitary firm’s policies does not raise the antitrust\ndangers that §1 was designed to police,” id., at 769, we\nheld that a parent corporation and its wholly owned sub­\nsidiary “are incapable of conspiring with each other for\npurposes of §1 of the Sherman Act,” id., at 777. We ex­\nplained that although a parent corporation and its wholly\nowned subsidiary are “separate” for the purposes of incor­\nporation or formal title, they are controlled by a single\ncenter of decisionmaking and they control a single aggre­\ngation of economic power. Joint conduct by two such\nentities does not “depriv[e] the marketplace of independ­\nent centers of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, and as a re­\nsult, an agreement between them does not constitute a\n“contract, combination . . . or conspiracy” for the purposes\n10            AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

S., at 773, n. 21. This inquiry is some­\ntimes described as asking whether the alleged conspira­\ntors are a single entity. That is perhaps a misdescription,\nhowever, because the question is not whether the defen­\ndant is a legally single entity or has a single name; nor is\nthe question whether the parties involved “seem” like one\nfirm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The key\nis whether the alleged “contract, combination . . . , or\nconspiracy” is concerted action—that is, whether it joins\ntogether separate decisionmakers. The relevant inquiry,\ntherefore, is whether there is a “contract, combination . . .\nor conspiracy” amongst “separate economic actors pursu­\ning separate economic interests,” id., at 769, such that the\nagreement “deprives the marketplace of independent\ncenters of decisionmaking,” ibid., and therefore of “diver­\nsity of entrepreneurial interests,” Fraser v. Major League\nSoccer, L. L. C., 284 F. 3d 47, 57 (CA1 2002) (Boudin,\nC. J.), and thus of actual or potential competition, see\nFreeman v.

Such agreements might be described as\n“really unilateral behavior flowing from decisions of a\nsingle enterprise.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 767. Nor, for\nthis reason, does §1 cover “internally coordinated conduct\nof a corporation and one of its unincorporated divisions,”\nid., at 770, because “[a] division within a corporate struc­\nture pursues the common interests of the whole,” ibid.,\nand therefore “coordination between a corporation and its\ndivision does not represent a sudden joining of two inde­\npendent sources of economic power previously pursuing\nseparate interests,” id., at 770–771. Nor, for the same\nreasons, is “the coordinated activity of a parent and its\nwholly owned subsidiary” covered. See id., at 771. They\n“have a complete unity of interest” and thus “[w]ith or\nwithout a formal ‘agreement,’ the subsidiary acts for the\nbenefit of the parent, its sole shareholder.” Ibid.\n   Because the inquiry is one of competitive reality, it is\nnot determinative that two parties to an alleged §1 viola­\ntion are legally distinct entities. Nor, however, is it de­\nterminative that two legally distinct entities have organ­\nized themselves under a single umbrella or into a\nstructured joint venture. The question is whether the\nagreement joins together “independent centers of deci­\nsionmaking.” Id., at 769. If it does, the entities are capa­\nble of conspiring under §1, and the court must decide\nwhether the restraint of trade is an unreasonable and\ntherefore illegal one.\n                           V\n  The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary deci­\nsionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic\n12          AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

Each of the\nteams is a substantial, independently owned, and inde­\npendently managed business. “[T]heir general corporate\nactions are guided or determined” by “separate corporate\nconsciousnesses,” and “[t]heir objectives are” not “com­\nmon.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 771; see also North\nAmerican Soccer League v. NFL, 670 F. 2d 1249, 1252\n(CA2 1982) (discussing ways that “the financial perform­\nance of each team, while related to that of the others, does\nnot . . . necessarily rise and fall with that of the others”).\nThe teams compete with one another, not only on the\nplaying field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts and for\ncontracts with managerial and playing personnel. See\nBrown v. Pro Football, Inc., 518 U. S. 231, 249 (1996);\nSullivan v. NFL, 34 F. 3d 1091, 1098 (CA1 1994); Mid-\nSouth Grizzlies v. NFL, 720 F. 2d 772, 787 (CA3 1983); cf.\nNCAA, 468 U. S., at 99.\n   Directly relevant to this case, the teams compete in the\nmarket for intellectual property. To a firm making hats,\nthe Saints and the Colts are two potentially competing\nsuppliers of valuable trademarks. When each NFL team\nlicenses its intellectual property, it is not pursuing the\n“common interests of the whole” league but is instead\npursuing interests of each “corporation itself,” Copperweld,\n467 U. S., at 770; teams are acting as “separate economic\nactors pursuing separate economic interests,” and each\nteam therefore is a potential “independent cente[r] of\ndecisionmaking,” id., at 769. Decisions by NFL teams to\nlicense their separately owned trademarks collectively and\nto only one vendor are decisions that “depriv[e] the mar­\nketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,” ibid.,\nand therefore of actual or potential competition. See\nNCAA, 468 U. S., at 109, n. 39 (observing a possible §1\nviolation if two separately owned companies sold their\nseparate products through a “single selling agent”); cf.\nAreeda & Hovenkamp ¶1478a, at 318 (“Obviously, the\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But it is\nnot dispositive that the teams have organized and own a\nlegally separate entity that centralizes the management of\ntheir intellectual property. An ongoing §1 violation cannot\nevade §1 scrutiny simply by giving the ongoing violation a\nname and label. “Perhaps every agreement and combina­\ntion in restraint of trade could be so labeled.” Timken\nRoller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 593, 598\n(1951).\n   The NFL respondents may be similar in some sense to a\nsingle enterprise that owns several pieces of intellectual\nproperty and licenses them jointly, but they are not simi­\nlar in the relevant functional sense. Although NFL teams\nhave common interests such as promoting the NFL brand,\nthey are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and\ntheir interests in licensing team trademarks are not nec­\nessarily aligned. See generally Hovenkamp, Exclusive\nJoint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 1995 Colum. Bus.\nL. Rev. 1, 52–61 (1995); Shishido, Conflicts of Interest and\nFiduciary Duties in the Operation of a Joint Venture, 39\nHastings L. J. 63, 69–81 (1987). Common interests in the\nNFL brand “partially unit[e] the economic interests of the\nparent firms,” Broadley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust\nPolicy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1521, 1526 (1982) (emphasis\nadded), but the teams still have distinct, potentially com­\npeting interests.\n   It may be, as respondents argue, that NFLP “has served\nas the ‘single driver’’ of the teams’ “promotional vehicle,”\n“ ‘pursu[ing] the common interests of the whole.’ ” Brief for\nNFL Respondents 28 (quoting Copperweld, 467 U.

It is true, as\nrespondents describe, that they have for some time mar­\nketed their trademarks jointly. But a history of concerted\nactivity does not immunize conduct from §1 scrutiny.\n“Absence of actual competition may simply be a manifes­\ntation of the anticompetitive agreement itself.” Freeman,\n322 F. 3d, at 1149.\n  Respondents argue that nonetheless, as the Court of\nAppeals held, they constitute a single entity because\nwithout their cooperation, there would be no NFL football.\nIt is true that “the clubs that make up a professional\nsports league are not completely independent economic\ncompetitors, as they depend upon a degree of cooperation\nfor economic survival.” Brown, 518 U. S., at 248. But the\nCourt of Appeals’ reasoning is unpersuasive.\n  The justification for cooperation is not relevant to\nwhether that cooperation is concerted or independent\naction.6 A “contract, combination . . . or conspiracy,” §1,\nthat is necessary or useful to a joint venture is still a\n“contract, combination . . . or conspiracy” if it “deprives the\nmarketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,”\nCopperweld, 467 U. S., at 769. See NCAA, 468 U. S., at\n113 (“[J]oint ventures have no immunity from antitrust\nlaws”). Any joint venture involves multiple sources of\neconomic power cooperating to produce a product. And for\nmany such ventures, the participation of others is neces­\nsary. But that does not mean that necessity of cooperation\ntransforms concerted action into independent action; a nut\nand a bolt can only operate together, but an agreement\nbetween nut and bolt manufacturers is still subject to §1\n——————\n  6 As discussed infra, necessity of cooperation is a factor relevant to\n\nwhether the agreement is subject to the Rule of Reason. See NCAA,\n468 U. S., at 101 (holding that NCAA restrictions on televising college\nfootball games are subject to Rule of Reason analysis for the “critical”\nreason that “horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the\nproduct is to be available at all”).\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Nor does it mean that once a group of firms\nagree to produce a joint product, cooperation amongst\nthose firms must be treated as independent conduct. The\nmere fact that the teams operate jointly in some sense\ndoes not mean that they are immune.7\n  The question whether NFLP decisions can constitute\nconcerted activity covered by §1 is closer than whether\ndecisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by §1.\nThis is so both because NFLP is a separate corporation\nwith its own management and because the record indi­\ncates that most of the revenues generated by NFLP are\nshared by the teams on an equal basis. Nevertheless we\nthink it clear that for the same reasons the 32 teams’\nconduct is covered by §1, NFLP’s actions also are subject\nto §1, at least with regards to its marketing of property\nowned by the separate teams. NFLP’s licensing decisions\nare made by the 32 potential competitors, and each of\nthem actually owns its share of the jointly managed as­\nsets. Cf. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354. Apart from their\nagreement to cooperate in exploiting those assets, includ­\ning their decisions as the NFLP, there would be nothing to\nprevent each of the teams from making its own market\n——————\n  7 In any event, it simply is not apparent that the alleged conduct was\n\nnecessary at all. Although two teams are needed to play a football\ngame, not all aspects of elaborate interleague cooperation are necessary\nto produce a game. Moreover, even if leaguewide agreements are\nnecessary to produce football, it does not follow that concerted activity\nin marketing intellectual property is necessary to produce football.\n  The Court of Appeals carved out a zone of antitrust immunity for\nconduct arguably related to league operations by reasoning that coordi­\nnated team trademark sales are necessary to produce “NFL football,” a\nsingle NFL brand that competes against other forms of entertainment.\nBut defining the product as “NFL football” puts the cart before the\nhorse: Of course the NFL produces NFL football; but that does not\nmean that cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from §1 scru­\ntiny. Members of any cartel could insist that their cooperation is\nnecessary to produce the “cartel product” and compete with other\nproducts.\n16           AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

Agree­\nments made within a firm can constitute concerted action\ncovered by §1 when the parties to the agreement act on\ninterests separate from those of the firm itself,8 and the\nintrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for\nongoing concerted action. See, e.g., Topco Associates, Inc.,\n405 U. S., at 609; Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354.\n   For that reason, decisions by the NFLP regarding the\nteams’ separately owned intellectual property constitute\nconcerted action. Thirty-two teams operating independ­\nently through the vehicle of the NFLP are not like the\ncomponents of a single firm that act to maximize the firm’s\nprofits. The teams remain separately controlled, potential\ncompetitors with economic interests that are distinct from\nNFLP’s financial well-being. See generally Hovenkamp,\n1995 Colum. Bus. L. Rev., at 52–61. Unlike typical deci­\nsions by corporate shareholders, NFLP licensing decisions\neffectively require the assent of more than a mere majority\nof shareholders. And each team’s decision reflects not only\nan interest in NFLP’s profits but also an interest in the\nteam’s individual profits. See generally Shusido, 39 Hast­\nings L. J., at 69–71.

NFL, 726 F. 2d 1381, 1389 (CA9\n1984) (emphasis added). In making the relevant licensing\ndecisions, NFLP is therefore “an instrumentality” of the\nteams. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354; see also Topco Asso\nciates, Inc., 405 U. S., at 609.\n   If the fact that potential competitors shared in profits or\nlosses from a venture meant that the venture was immune\nfrom §1, then any cartel “could evade the antitrust law\nsimply by creating a ‘joint venture’ to serve as the exclu­\nsive seller of their competing products.” Major League\nBaseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F. 3d 290,\n335 (CA2 2008) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment).\n“So long as no agreement,” other than one made by the\ncartelists sitting on the board of the joint venture, “explic­\nitly listed the prices to be charged, the companies could act\nas monopolies through the ‘joint venture.’ ” Ibid. (Indeed,\na joint venture with a single management structure is\ngenerally a better way to operate a cartel because it de­\ncreases the risks of a party to an illegal agreement defect­\ning from that agreement). However, competitors “cannot\nsimply get around” antitrust liability by acting “through a\nthird-party intermediary or ‘joint venture’.” Id., at 336.9\n——————\n  9 For the purposes of resolving this case, there is no need to pass upon\n\nthe Government’s position that entities are incapable of conspiring\nunder §1 if they “have effectively merged the relevant aspect of their\noperations, thereby eliminating actual and potential competition . . . in\nthat operational sphere” and “the challenged restraint [does] not\nsignificantly affect actual or potential competition . . . outside their\nmerged operations.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17.

The fact that NFL teams share an interest in\nmaking the entire league successful and profitable, and\nthat they must cooperate in the production and scheduling\nof games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for\nmaking a host of collective decisions. But the conduct at\nissue in this case is still concerted activity under the\nSherman Act that is subject to §1 analysis.\n  When “restraints on competition are essential if the\nproduct is to be available at all,” per se rules of illegality\nare inapplicable, and instead the restraint must be judged\naccording to the flexible Rule of Reason.10 NCAA, 468\n——————\nGovernment urges that the choices “to offer only a blanket license” and\n“to have only a single headwear licensee” might not constitute con­\ncerted action under its test. Id., at 32. However, because the teams\nstill own their own trademarks and are free to market those trade­\nmarks as they see fit, even those two choices were agreements amongst\npotential competitors and would constitute concerted action under the\nGovernment’s own standard. At any point, the teams could decide to\nlicense their own trademarks. It is significant, moreover, that the\nteams here control NFLP. The two choices that the Government might\ntreat as independent action, although nominally made by NFLP, are for\nall functional purposes choices made by the 32 entities with potentially\ncompeting interests.\n   10 Justice Brandeis provided the classic formulation of the Rule of\n\nReason in Board of Trade of Chicago v.

We have recognized, for example,\n“that the interest in maintaining a competitive balance”\namong “athletic teams is legitimate and important,”\nNCAA, 468 U. S., at 117. While that same interest applies\nto the teams in the NFL, it does not justify treating them\nas a single entity for §1 purposes when it comes to the\nmarketing of the teams’ individually owned intellectual\nproperty. It is, however, unquestionably an interest that\nmay well justify a variety of collective decisions made by\nthe teams.

Argued January 13, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\nRespondent National Football League (NFL) is an unincorporated asso\n  ciation of 32 separately owned professional football teams, also re\n  spondents here. The teams, each of which owns its own name, colors,\n  logo, trademarks, and related intellectual property, formed respon\n  dent National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license,\n  and market that property. At first, NFLP granted nonexclusive li\n  censes to petitioner and other vendors to manufacture and sell team\n  labeled apparel. In December 2000, however, the teams authorized\n  NFLP to grant exclusive licenses. NFLP granted an exclusive license\n  to respondent Reebok International Ltd. to produce and sell trade\n  marked headwear for all 32 teams. When petitioner’s license was not\n  renewed, it filed this action alleging that the agreements between re\n  spondents violated the Sherman Act, §1 of which makes “[e]very con\n  tract, combination . . . or, conspiracy, in restraint of trade” illegal.\n  Respondents answered that they were incapable of conspiring within\n  §1’s meaning because the NFL and its teams are, in antitrust law\n  jargon, a single entity with respect to the conduct challenged. The\n  District Court granted respondents summary judgment, and the Sev\n  enth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The alleged conduct related to licensing of intellectual property\n constitutes concerted action that is not categorically beyond §1’s cov\n erage. Pp. 4–20.\n    (a) The meaning of “contract, combination . . . , or, conspiracy” in §1\n of the Sherman Act is informed by the Act’s “ ‘basic distinction be\n tween concerted and independent action.’ ” Copperweld Corp. v. In\n dependence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 767. Section 1 “treat[s] con\n certed behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior,” id., at 768,\n2               AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL \n\n                       FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                       \n\n                            Syllabus \n\n\n    because, unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity inherently is\n    fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as it “deprives the market\n    place of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition as\n    sumes and demands,” id., at 768–769. And because concerted action\n    is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a\n    vast amount of business conduct. That creates less risk of deterring\n    a firm’s necessary conduct and leaves courts to examine only discrete\n    agreements. An arrangement must therefore embody concerted ac\n    tion in order to be a “contract, combination . . . or, conspiracy” under\n    §1. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) In determining whether there is concerted action under §1, the\n    Court has eschewed formalistic distinctions, such as whether the al\n    leged conspirators are legally distinct entities, in favor of a functional\n    consideration of how they actually operate. The Court has repeatedly\n    found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated\n    §1 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and\n    served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity. See,\n    e.g., United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350, 352–356. Conversely,\n    the Court has found that although the entities may be “separate” for\n    purposes of incorporation or formal title, if they are controlled by a\n    single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation\n    of economic power, an agreement between them does not constitute a\n    “contract, combination . . . or, conspiracy.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at\n    769. Pp. 6–10.\n       (c) The relevant inquiry is therefore one of substance, not form,\n    which does not turn on whether the alleged parties to contract, com\n    bination, or conspiracy are part of a legally single entity or seem like\n    one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The inquiry is\n    whether the agreement in question joins together “separate economic\n    actors pursuing separate economic interests,” Copperweld, 467 U. S.,\n    at 768, such that it “deprives the marketplace of independent centers\n    of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, and therefore of diversity of entrepre\n    neurial interests and thus of actual or potential competition. If it\n    does, then there is concerted action covered by §1, and the court must\n    decide whether the restraint of trade is unreasonable and therefore\n    illegal. Pp. 10–11.\n       (d) The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmak\n    ing quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic\n    of independent action. Each of them is a substantial, independently\n    owned, independently managed business, whose “general corporate\n    actions are guided or determined” by “separate corporate conscious\n    nesses,” and whose “objectives are” not “common.” Copperweld, 467\n    U. S., at 771. They compete with one another, not only on the play\n    ing field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts, and for contracts with\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  managerial and playing personnel. See, e.g., Brown v. Pro Football,\n  Inc., 518 U. S. 231, 249. Directly relevant here, the teams are poten\n  tially competing suppliers in the market for intellectual property.\n  When teams license such property, they are not pursuing the “com\n  mon interests of the whole” league, but, instead, the interests of each\n  “corporation itself.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 770. It is not disposi\n  tive, as respondents argue, that, by forming NFLP, they have formed\n  a single entity, akin to a merger, and market their NFL brands\n  through a single outlet. Although the NFL respondents may be simi\n  lar in some sense to a single enterprise, they are not similar in the\n  relevant functional sense. While teams have common interests such\n  as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit\n  maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trade\n  marks are not necessarily aligned. Nor does it matter that the teams\n  may find the alleged cooperation necessary to compete against other\n  forms of entertainment. Although decisions made by NFLP are not\n  as easily classified as concerted activity, the NFLP’s decisions about\n  licensing the teams’ separately owned intellectual property are con\n  certed activity and thus covered by §1 for the same reason that deci\n  sions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by §1. In making the\n  relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is “an instrumentality” of the\n  teams. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354. Pp. 11–17.\n     (e) Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by anti\n  trust law. The fact that the NFL teams share an interest in making\n  the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must coop\n  erate to produce games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for\n  making a host of collective decisions. Because some of these re\n  straints on competition are necessary to produce the NFL’s product,\n  the Rule of Reason generally should apply, and teams’ cooperation is\n  likely to be permissible. And depending upon the activity in ques\n  tion, the Rule of Reason can at times be applied without detailed\n  analysis. But the activity at issue in this case is still concerted activ\n  ity covered for §1 purposes.

S. C. §1. The question whether an ar­\nrangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is\ndifferent from and antecedent to the question whether it\nunreasonably restrains trade. This case raises that ante­\ncedent question about the business of the 32 teams in the\nNational Football League (NFL) and a corporate entity\nthat they formed to manage their intellectual property.\nWe conclude that the NFL’s licensing activities constitute\nconcerted action that is not categorically beyond the cov­\nerage of §1. The legality of that concerted action must be\njudged under the Rule of Reason.\n                              I\n  Originally organized in 1920, the NFL is an unincorpo­\nrated association that now includes 32 separately owned\nprofessional football teams.1 Each team has its own name,\n——————\n 1 The   NFL was founded in Canton, Ohio as the “American Profes­\n2            AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL \n\n                    FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                       \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncolors, and logo, and owns related intellectual property.\nLike each of the other teams in the league, the New Or­\nleans Saints and the Indianapolis Colts, for example, have\ntheir own distinctive names, colors, and marks that are\nwell known to millions of sports fans.\n   Prior to 1963, the teams made their own arrangements\nfor licensing their intellectual property and marketing\ntrademarked items such as caps and jerseys. In 1963, the\nteams formed National Football League Properties (NFLP)\nto develop, license, and market their intellectual property.\nMost, but not all, of the substantial revenues generated by\nNFLP have either been given to charity or shared equally\namong the teams. However, the teams are able to and\nhave at times sought to withdraw from this arrangement.\n   Between 1963 and 2000, NFLP granted nonexclusive\nlicenses to a number of vendors, permitting them to manu­\nfacture and sell apparel bearing team insignias. Peti­\ntioner, American Needle, Inc., was one of those licensees.\nIn December 2000, the teams voted to authorize NFLP to\ngrant exclusive licenses, and NFLP granted Reebok Inter­\nnational Ltd. an exclusive 10-year license to manufacture\nand sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams. It there­\nafter declined to renew American Needle’s nonexclusive\nlicense.\n   American Needle filed this action in the Northern Dis­\ntrict of Illinois, alleging that the agreements between the\nNFL, its teams, NFLP, and Reebok violated §§1 and 2 of\nthe Sherman Act. In their answer to the complaint, the\ndefendants averred that the teams, NFL, and NFLP were\nincapable of conspiring within the meaning of §1 “because\nthey are a single economic enterprise, at least with respect\n\n——————\nsional Football Association.” United States Football League v.

After limited discov­\nery, the District Court granted summary judgment on the\nquestion “whether, with regard to the facet of their opera­\ntions respecting exploitation of intellectual property\nrights, the NFL and its 32 teams are, in the jargon of\nantitrust law, acting as a single entity.” American Needle,\nInc. v. New Orleans La. Saints, 496 F. Supp. 2d 941, 943\n(2007). The court concluded “that in that facet of their\noperations they have so integrated their operations that\nthey should be deemed a single entity rather than joint\nventures cooperating for a common purpose.” Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nThe panel observed that “in some contexts, a league seems\nmore aptly described as a single entity immune from\nantitrust scrutiny, while in others a league appears to be a\njoint venture between independently owned teams that is\nsubject to review under §1.” 538 F. 3d, 736, 741 (2008).\nRelying on Circuit precedent, the court limited its inquiry\nto the particular conduct at issue, licensing of teams’\nintellectual property. The panel agreed with petitioner\nthat “when making a single-entity determination, courts\nmust examine whether the conduct in question deprives\nthe marketplace of the independent sources of economic\ncontrol that competition assumes.” Id., at 742. The court,\nhowever, discounted the significance of potential competi­\ntion among the teams regarding the use of their intellec­\ntual property because the teams “can function only as one\nsource of economic power when collectively producing NFL\nfootball.” Id., at 743. The court noted that football itself\ncan only be carried out jointly. See ibid. (“Asserting that\na single football team could produce a football game . . . is\na Zen riddle: Who wins when a football team plays itself ”).\nMoreover, “NFL teams share a vital economic interest in\ncollectively promoting NFL football . . . [to] compet[e] with\nother forms of entertainment.” Ibid. “It thus follows,” the\ncourt found, “that only one source of economic power con­\n4           AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

Recognizing that NFL teams\nhave “license[d] their intellectual property collectively”\nsince 1963, the court held that §1 did not apply. Id., at\n744.\n   We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. __ (2009).\n                              II\n   As the case comes to us, we have only a narrow issue to\ndecide: whether the NFL respondents are capable of en­\ngaging in a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” as\ndefined by §1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. §1, or, as we\nhave sometimes phrased it, whether the alleged activity\nby the NFL respondents “must be viewed as that of a\nsingle enterprise for purposes of §1.” Copperweld Corp. v.\nIndependence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 771 (1984).\n   Taken literally, the applicability of §1 to “every contract,\ncombination . . . or conspiracy” could be understood to\ncover every conceivable agreement, whether it be a group\nof competing firms fixing prices or a single firm’s chief\nexecutive telling her subordinate how to price their com­\npany’s product. But even though, “read literally,” §1\nwould address “the entire body of private contract,” that is\nnot what the statute means. National Soc. of Professional\nEngineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 688 (1978); see\nalso Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U. S. 1, 5 (2006) (“This\nCourt has not taken a literal approach to this language”);\ncf. Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S.\n231, 238 (1918) (reasoning that the term “restraint of\ntrade” in §1 cannot possibly refer to any restraint on com­\npetition because “[e]very agreement concerning trade,\nevery regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain,\nis of their very essence”). Not every instance of co-\noperation between two people is a potential “contract,\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)               5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncombination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.” 15\nU. S. C. §1.\n   The meaning of the term “contract, combination . . . or\nconspiracy” is informed by the “ ‘basic distinction’ ” in the\nSherman Act “ ‘between concerted and independent ac­\ntion’ ” that distinguishes §1 of the Sherman Act from §2.\nCopperweld, 467 U. S., at 767 (quoting Monsanto Co. v.\nSpray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 761 (1984)).\nSection 1 applies only to concerted action that restrains\ntrade. Section 2, by contrast, covers both concerted and\nindependent action, but only if that action “monopolize[s],”\n15 U. S. C. §2, or “threatens actual monopolization,” Cop\nperweld, 467 U. S., at 767, a category that is narrower\nthan restraint of trade. Monopoly power may be equally\nharmful whether it is the product of joint action or indi­\nvidual action.\n   Congress used this distinction between concerted and\nindependent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and\ncompensate its victims, without chilling vigorous competi­\ntion through ordinary business operations. The distinc­\ntion also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine, internal busi­\nness decisions.\n   Thus, in §1 Congress “treated concerted behavior more\nstrictly than unilateral behavior.” Id., at 768. This is so\nbecause unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity\ninherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as\nit “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of\ndecisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.”\nId., at 768–769. And because concerted action is discrete\nand distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a\nvast amount of business conduct. As a result, there is less\nrisk of deterring a firm’s necessary conduct; courts need\nonly examine discrete agreements; and such conduct may\nbe remedied simply through prohibition.2 See Areeda &\n——————\n 2 If   Congress prohibited independent action that merely restrains\n6            AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v. NATIONAL \n\n                    FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                   \n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nHovenkamp ¶1464c, at 206. Concerted activity is thus\n“judged more sternly than unilateral activity under §2,”\nCopperweld, 467 U. S., at 768. For these reasons, §1\nprohibits any concerted action “in restraint of trade or\ncommerce,” even if the action does not “threate[n] monopo­\nlization,” Ibid. And therefore, an arrangement must\nembody concerted action in order to be a “contract, combi­\nnation . . . or conspiracy” under §1.\n                             III\n   We have long held that concerted action under §1 does\nnot turn simply on whether the parties involved are le­\ngally distinct entities. Instead, we have eschewed such\nformalistic distinctions in favor of a functional considera­\ntion of how the parties involved in the alleged anticom­\npetitive conduct actually operate.\n   As a result, we have repeatedly found instances in\nwhich members of a legally single entity violated §1 when\nthe entity was controlled by a group of competitors and\nserved, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted\nactivity. In United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350\n(1967), for example, a group of mattress manufacturers\noperated and controlled Sealy, Inc., a company that li­\ncensed the Sealy trademark to the manufacturers, and\n——————\ntrade (even if it does not threaten monopolization), that prohibition\ncould deter perfectly competitive conduct by firms that are fearful of\nlitigation costs and judicial error. See Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 768\n(“Judging unilateral conduct in this manner reduces the risk that the\nantitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive\ncompetitor”); cf. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S.\n422, 441 (1978) (“[S]alutary and procompetitive conduct . . . might be\nshunned by businessmen who chose to be excessively cautious in the\nface of uncertainty”). Moreover, if every unilateral action that re­\nstrained trade were subject to antitrust scrutiny, then courts would be\nforced to judge almost every internal business decision. See 7 P.\nAreeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶1464c, at 206 (2d ed. 2003)\n(hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp) (unilateral behavior is “often\ndifficult to evaluate or remedy”).\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

The Government alleged that the\nlicensees and Sealy were conspiring in violation of §1, and\nwe agreed. Id., at 352–354. We explained that “[w]e seek\nthe central substance of the situation” and therefore “we\nare moved by the identity of the persons who act, rather\nthan the label of their hats.” Id., at 353. We thus held\nthat Sealy was not a “separate entity, but . . . an instru­\nmentality of the individual manufacturers.” Id., at 356.\nIn similar circumstances, we have found other formally\ndistinct business organizations covered by §1.

In United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S.\n218 (1947), we observed that “corporate interrelationships\n. . . are not determinitive of the applicability of the\nSherman Act” because the Act “is aimed at substance\nrather than form.” Id., at 227. We nonetheless held that\ncooperation between legally separate entities was neces­\nsarily covered by §1 because an unreasonable restraint of\ntrade “may result as readily from a conspiracy among\nthose who are affiliated or integrated under common\nownership as from a conspiracy among those who are\notherwise independent.” Ibid.; see also Kiefer-Stewart Co.\nv. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211, 215\n(1951).\n    The decline of the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine\nbegan in Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus\nProducts Co., 370 U. S. 19 (1962). In that case, several\nagricultural cooperatives that were owned by the same\nfarmers were sued for violations of §1 of the Sherman Act.\nId., at 24–25. Applying a specific immunity provision for\nagricultural cooperatives, we held that the three coopera­\ntives were “in practical effect” one “organization,” even\nthough the controlling farmers “have formally organized\nthemselves into three separate legal entities.” Id., at 29.\n“To hold otherwise,” we explained, “would be to impose\ngrave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions\nthat are of de minimis meaning and effect” insofar as “use\nof separate corporations had [no] economic significance.”\nIbid.\n    Next, in United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat.\nBank, 422 U. S. 86 (1975), a large bank, Citizens and\nSouthern (C&S), formed a holding company that operated\nde facto suburban branch banks in the Atlanta area\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough ownership of the maximum amount of stock in\neach local branch that was allowed by law, “ownership of\nmuch of the remaining stock by parties friendly to C&S,\nuse by the suburban banks of the C&S logogram and all of\nC&S’s banking services, and close C&S oversight of the\noperation and governance of the suburban banks.” Id., at\n89 (footnote omitted). The Government challenged the\ncooperation between the banks. In our analysis, we ob­\nserved that “ ‘corporate interrelationships . . . are not\ndeterminative,’ ” id., at 116, “looked to economic sub­\nstance,” and observed that “because the sponsored banks\nwere not set up to be competitors, §1 did not compel them\nto compete.” Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶1463, at 200–201;\nsee also Citizens & Southern, 422 U. S., at 119–120;\nAreeda, Intraenterprise Conspiracy in Decline, 97 Harv.\nL. Rev. 451, 461 (1983).\n  We finally reexamined the intraenterprise conspiracy\ndoctrine in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.,\n467 U. S. 752 (1984), and concluded that it was inconsis­\ntent with the “ ‘basic distinction between concerted and\nindependent action.’ ” Id., at 767. Considering it “per­\nfectly plain that an internal agreement to implement a\nsingle, unitary firm’s policies does not raise the antitrust\ndangers that §1 was designed to police,” id., at 769, we\nheld that a parent corporation and its wholly owned sub­\nsidiary “are incapable of conspiring with each other for\npurposes of §1 of the Sherman Act,” id., at 777. We ex­\nplained that although a parent corporation and its wholly\nowned subsidiary are “separate” for the purposes of incor­\nporation or formal title, they are controlled by a single\ncenter of decisionmaking and they control a single aggre­\ngation of economic power. Joint conduct by two such\nentities does not “depriv[e] the marketplace of independ­\nent centers of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, and as a re­\nsult, an agreement between them does not constitute a\n“contract, combination . . . or conspiracy” for the purposes\n10            AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

S., at 773, n. 21. This inquiry is some­\ntimes described as asking whether the alleged conspira­\ntors are a single entity. That is perhaps a misdescription,\nhowever, because the question is not whether the defen­\ndant is a legally single entity or has a single name; nor is\nthe question whether the parties involved “seem” like one\nfirm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The key\nis whether the alleged “contract, combination . . . , or\nconspiracy” is concerted action—that is, whether it joins\ntogether separate decisionmakers. The relevant inquiry,\ntherefore, is whether there is a “contract, combination . . .\nor conspiracy” amongst “separate economic actors pursu­\ning separate economic interests,” id., at 769, such that the\nagreement “deprives the marketplace of independent\ncenters of decisionmaking,” ibid., and therefore of “diver­\nsity of entrepreneurial interests,” Fraser v. Major League\nSoccer, L. L. C., 284 F. 3d 47, 57 (CA1 2002) (Boudin,\nC. J.), and thus of actual or potential competition, see\nFreeman v.

Such agreements might be described as\n“really unilateral behavior flowing from decisions of a\nsingle enterprise.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 767. Nor, for\nthis reason, does §1 cover “internally coordinated conduct\nof a corporation and one of its unincorporated divisions,”\nid., at 770, because “[a] division within a corporate struc­\nture pursues the common interests of the whole,” ibid.,\nand therefore “coordination between a corporation and its\ndivision does not represent a sudden joining of two inde­\npendent sources of economic power previously pursuing\nseparate interests,” id., at 770–771. Nor, for the same\nreasons, is “the coordinated activity of a parent and its\nwholly owned subsidiary” covered. See id., at 771. They\n“have a complete unity of interest” and thus “[w]ith or\nwithout a formal ‘agreement,’ the subsidiary acts for the\nbenefit of the parent, its sole shareholder.” Ibid.\n   Because the inquiry is one of competitive reality, it is\nnot determinative that two parties to an alleged §1 viola­\ntion are legally distinct entities. Nor, however, is it de­\nterminative that two legally distinct entities have organ­\nized themselves under a single umbrella or into a\nstructured joint venture. The question is whether the\nagreement joins together “independent centers of deci­\nsionmaking.” Id., at 769. If it does, the entities are capa­\nble of conspiring under §1, and the court must decide\nwhether the restraint of trade is an unreasonable and\ntherefore illegal one.\n                           V\n  The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary deci­\nsionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic\n12          AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

Each of the\nteams is a substantial, independently owned, and inde­\npendently managed business. “[T]heir general corporate\nactions are guided or determined” by “separate corporate\nconsciousnesses,” and “[t]heir objectives are” not “com­\nmon.” Copperweld, 467 U. S., at 771; see also North\nAmerican Soccer League v. NFL, 670 F. 2d 1249, 1252\n(CA2 1982) (discussing ways that “the financial perform­\nance of each team, while related to that of the others, does\nnot . . . necessarily rise and fall with that of the others”).\nThe teams compete with one another, not only on the\nplaying field, but to attract fans, for gate receipts and for\ncontracts with managerial and playing personnel. See\nBrown v. Pro Football, Inc., 518 U. S. 231, 249 (1996);\nSullivan v. NFL, 34 F. 3d 1091, 1098 (CA1 1994); Mid-\nSouth Grizzlies v. NFL, 720 F. 2d 772, 787 (CA3 1983); cf.\nNCAA, 468 U. S., at 99.\n   Directly relevant to this case, the teams compete in the\nmarket for intellectual property. To a firm making hats,\nthe Saints and the Colts are two potentially competing\nsuppliers of valuable trademarks. When each NFL team\nlicenses its intellectual property, it is not pursuing the\n“common interests of the whole” league but is instead\npursuing interests of each “corporation itself,” Copperweld,\n467 U. S., at 770; teams are acting as “separate economic\nactors pursuing separate economic interests,” and each\nteam therefore is a potential “independent cente[r] of\ndecisionmaking,” id., at 769. Decisions by NFL teams to\nlicense their separately owned trademarks collectively and\nto only one vendor are decisions that “depriv[e] the mar­\nketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,” ibid.,\nand therefore of actual or potential competition. See\nNCAA, 468 U. S., at 109, n. 39 (observing a possible §1\nviolation if two separately owned companies sold their\nseparate products through a “single selling agent”); cf.\nAreeda & Hovenkamp ¶1478a, at 318 (“Obviously, the\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But it is\nnot dispositive that the teams have organized and own a\nlegally separate entity that centralizes the management of\ntheir intellectual property. An ongoing §1 violation cannot\nevade §1 scrutiny simply by giving the ongoing violation a\nname and label. “Perhaps every agreement and combina­\ntion in restraint of trade could be so labeled.” Timken\nRoller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 593, 598\n(1951).\n   The NFL respondents may be similar in some sense to a\nsingle enterprise that owns several pieces of intellectual\nproperty and licenses them jointly, but they are not simi­\nlar in the relevant functional sense. Although NFL teams\nhave common interests such as promoting the NFL brand,\nthey are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and\ntheir interests in licensing team trademarks are not nec­\nessarily aligned. See generally Hovenkamp, Exclusive\nJoint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 1995 Colum. Bus.\nL. Rev. 1, 52–61 (1995); Shishido, Conflicts of Interest and\nFiduciary Duties in the Operation of a Joint Venture, 39\nHastings L. J. 63, 69–81 (1987). Common interests in the\nNFL brand “partially unit[e] the economic interests of the\nparent firms,” Broadley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust\nPolicy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1521, 1526 (1982) (emphasis\nadded), but the teams still have distinct, potentially com­\npeting interests.\n   It may be, as respondents argue, that NFLP “has served\nas the ‘single driver’’ of the teams’ “promotional vehicle,”\n“ ‘pursu[ing] the common interests of the whole.’ ” Brief for\nNFL Respondents 28 (quoting Copperweld, 467 U.

It is true, as\nrespondents describe, that they have for some time mar­\nketed their trademarks jointly. But a history of concerted\nactivity does not immunize conduct from §1 scrutiny.\n“Absence of actual competition may simply be a manifes­\ntation of the anticompetitive agreement itself.” Freeman,\n322 F. 3d, at 1149.\n  Respondents argue that nonetheless, as the Court of\nAppeals held, they constitute a single entity because\nwithout their cooperation, there would be no NFL football.\nIt is true that “the clubs that make up a professional\nsports league are not completely independent economic\ncompetitors, as they depend upon a degree of cooperation\nfor economic survival.” Brown, 518 U. S., at 248. But the\nCourt of Appeals’ reasoning is unpersuasive.\n  The justification for cooperation is not relevant to\nwhether that cooperation is concerted or independent\naction.6 A “contract, combination . . . or conspiracy,” §1,\nthat is necessary or useful to a joint venture is still a\n“contract, combination . . . or conspiracy” if it “deprives the\nmarketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,”\nCopperweld, 467 U. S., at 769. See NCAA, 468 U. S., at\n113 (“[J]oint ventures have no immunity from antitrust\nlaws”). Any joint venture involves multiple sources of\neconomic power cooperating to produce a product. And for\nmany such ventures, the participation of others is neces­\nsary. But that does not mean that necessity of cooperation\ntransforms concerted action into independent action; a nut\nand a bolt can only operate together, but an agreement\nbetween nut and bolt manufacturers is still subject to §1\n——————\n  6 As discussed infra, necessity of cooperation is a factor relevant to\n\nwhether the agreement is subject to the Rule of Reason. See NCAA,\n468 U. S., at 101 (holding that NCAA restrictions on televising college\nfootball games are subject to Rule of Reason analysis for the “critical”\nreason that “horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the\nproduct is to be available at all”).\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Nor does it mean that once a group of firms\nagree to produce a joint product, cooperation amongst\nthose firms must be treated as independent conduct. The\nmere fact that the teams operate jointly in some sense\ndoes not mean that they are immune.7\n  The question whether NFLP decisions can constitute\nconcerted activity covered by §1 is closer than whether\ndecisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by §1.\nThis is so both because NFLP is a separate corporation\nwith its own management and because the record indi­\ncates that most of the revenues generated by NFLP are\nshared by the teams on an equal basis. Nevertheless we\nthink it clear that for the same reasons the 32 teams’\nconduct is covered by §1, NFLP’s actions also are subject\nto §1, at least with regards to its marketing of property\nowned by the separate teams. NFLP’s licensing decisions\nare made by the 32 potential competitors, and each of\nthem actually owns its share of the jointly managed as­\nsets. Cf. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354. Apart from their\nagreement to cooperate in exploiting those assets, includ­\ning their decisions as the NFLP, there would be nothing to\nprevent each of the teams from making its own market\n——————\n  7 In any event, it simply is not apparent that the alleged conduct was\n\nnecessary at all. Although two teams are needed to play a football\ngame, not all aspects of elaborate interleague cooperation are necessary\nto produce a game. Moreover, even if leaguewide agreements are\nnecessary to produce football, it does not follow that concerted activity\nin marketing intellectual property is necessary to produce football.\n  The Court of Appeals carved out a zone of antitrust immunity for\nconduct arguably related to league operations by reasoning that coordi­\nnated team trademark sales are necessary to produce “NFL football,” a\nsingle NFL brand that competes against other forms of entertainment.\nBut defining the product as “NFL football” puts the cart before the\nhorse: Of course the NFL produces NFL football; but that does not\nmean that cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from §1 scru­\ntiny. Members of any cartel could insist that their cooperation is\nnecessary to produce the “cartel product” and compete with other\nproducts.\n16           AMERICAN NEEDLE, INC. v.

Agree­\nments made within a firm can constitute concerted action\ncovered by §1 when the parties to the agreement act on\ninterests separate from those of the firm itself,8 and the\nintrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for\nongoing concerted action. See, e.g., Topco Associates, Inc.,\n405 U. S., at 609; Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354.\n   For that reason, decisions by the NFLP regarding the\nteams’ separately owned intellectual property constitute\nconcerted action. Thirty-two teams operating independ­\nently through the vehicle of the NFLP are not like the\ncomponents of a single firm that act to maximize the firm’s\nprofits. The teams remain separately controlled, potential\ncompetitors with economic interests that are distinct from\nNFLP’s financial well-being. See generally Hovenkamp,\n1995 Colum. Bus. L. Rev., at 52–61. Unlike typical deci­\nsions by corporate shareholders, NFLP licensing decisions\neffectively require the assent of more than a mere majority\nof shareholders. And each team’s decision reflects not only\nan interest in NFLP’s profits but also an interest in the\nteam’s individual profits. See generally Shusido, 39 Hast­\nings L. J., at 69–71.

NFL, 726 F. 2d 1381, 1389 (CA9\n1984) (emphasis added). In making the relevant licensing\ndecisions, NFLP is therefore “an instrumentality” of the\nteams. Sealy, 388 U. S., at 352–354; see also Topco Asso\nciates, Inc., 405 U. S., at 609.\n   If the fact that potential competitors shared in profits or\nlosses from a venture meant that the venture was immune\nfrom §1, then any cartel “could evade the antitrust law\nsimply by creating a ‘joint venture’ to serve as the exclu­\nsive seller of their competing products.” Major League\nBaseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F. 3d 290,\n335 (CA2 2008) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment).\n“So long as no agreement,” other than one made by the\ncartelists sitting on the board of the joint venture, “explic­\nitly listed the prices to be charged, the companies could act\nas monopolies through the ‘joint venture.’ ” Ibid. (Indeed,\na joint venture with a single management structure is\ngenerally a better way to operate a cartel because it de­\ncreases the risks of a party to an illegal agreement defect­\ning from that agreement). However, competitors “cannot\nsimply get around” antitrust liability by acting “through a\nthird-party intermediary or ‘joint venture’.” Id., at 336.9\n——————\n  9 For the purposes of resolving this case, there is no need to pass upon\n\nthe Government’s position that entities are incapable of conspiring\nunder §1 if they “have effectively merged the relevant aspect of their\noperations, thereby eliminating actual and potential competition . . . in\nthat operational sphere” and “the challenged restraint [does] not\nsignificantly affect actual or potential competition . . . outside their\nmerged operations.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17.

Brown, 518 U. S., at 252 (STEVENS, J., dis­\nsenting). The fact that NFL teams share an interest in\nmaking the entire league successful and profitable, and\nthat they must cooperate in the production and scheduling\nof games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for\nmaking a host of collective decisions. But the conduct at\nissue in this case is still concerted activity under the\nSherman Act that is subject to §1 analysis.\n  When “restraints on competition are essential if the\nproduct is to be available at all,” per se rules of illegality\nare inapplicable, and instead the restraint must be judged\naccording to the flexible Rule of Reason.10 NCAA, 468\n——————\nGovernment urges that the choices “to offer only a blanket license” and\n“to have only a single headwear licensee” might not constitute con­\ncerted action under its test. Id., at 32. However, because the teams\nstill own their own trademarks and are free to market those trade­\nmarks as they see fit, even those two choices were agreements amongst\npotential competitors and would constitute concerted action under the\nGovernment’s own standard. At any point, the teams could decide to\nlicense their own trademarks. It is significant, moreover, that the\nteams here control NFLP. The two choices that the Government might\ntreat as independent action, although nominally made by NFLP, are for\nall functional purposes choices made by the 32 entities with potentially\ncompeting interests.\n   10 Justice Brandeis provided the classic formulation of the Rule of\n\nReason in Board of Trade of Chicago v.

S. 231,\n\n238 (1918): \n\n“The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as \n\nmerely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether\nit is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine\nthat question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to\nthe business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and\nafter the restraint is imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect,\nactual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to\nexist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S., at 101; see id., at 117 (“Our decision not to apply a\nper se rule to this case rests in large part on our recogni­\ntion that a certain degree of cooperation is necessary if the\ntype of competition that petitioner and its member institu­\ntions seek to market is to be preserved”); see also Dagher,\n547 U. S., at 6. In such instances, the agreement is likely\nto survive the Rule of Reason. See Broadcast Music, Inc.\nv. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 23\n(1979) (“Joint ventures and other cooperative arrange­\nments are also not usually unlawful. . . where the agree­\nment . . . is necessary to market the product at all”). And\ndepending upon the concerted activity in question, the\nRule of Reason may not require a detailed analysis; it “can\nsometimes be applied in the twinkling of an eye.” NCAA,\n468 U. S., at 109, n. 39.\n   Other features of the NFL may also save agreements\namongst the teams. We have recognized, for example,\n“that the interest in maintaining a competitive balance”\namong “athletic teams is legitimate and important,”\nNCAA, 468 U. S., at 117. While that same interest applies\nto the teams in the NFL, it does not justify treating them\nas a single entity for §1 purposes when it comes to the\nmarketing of the teams’ individually owned intellectual\nproperty. It is, however, unquestionably an interest that\nmay well justify a variety of collective decisions made by\nthe teams. What role it properly plays in applying the\nRule of Reason to the allegations in this case is a matter to\nbe considered on remand.\n\n\n——————\nsought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good\nintention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse;\nbut because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts\nand to predict consequences.” See also Leegin Creative Leather Prod\nucts, Inc. v.
