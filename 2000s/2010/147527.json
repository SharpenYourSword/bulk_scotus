UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u20131301. Argued February 24, 2010\u2014Decided June 1, 2010\nEnacted in 2006, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\n (SORNA) makes it a federal crime for, inter alia, any person (1) who\n \u201cis required to register under [SORNA],\u201d and (2) who \u201ctravels in in\n terstate or foreign commerce,\u201d to (3) \u201cknowingly fai[l] to register or\n update a registration,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a). Before SORNA\u2019s enact\n ment, petitioner Carr, a registered sex offender in Alabama, relocated\n to Indiana without complying with the latter State\u2019s registration re\n quirements. Carr was indicted under \u00a72250 post-SORNA. The Fed\n eral District Court denied Carr\u2019s motion to dismiss, which asserted\n that the \u00a72250 prosecution would violate the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post\n Facto Clause because he had traveled to Indiana before SORNA\u2019s ef\n fective date. Carr then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison.\n Affirming the conviction, the Seventh Circuit held that \u00a72250 does\n not require that a defendant\u2019s travel postdate SORNA and that reli\n ance on a defendant\u2019s pre-SORNA travel poses no ex post facto prob\n lem so long as the defendant had a reasonable time to register post-\n SORNA but failed to do so, as had Carr.\nHeld: Section 2250 does not apply to sex offenders whose interstate\n travel occurred before SORNA\u2019s effective date. Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The Court rejects the Government\u2019s view that \u00a72250(a) requires\n a sex-offense conviction, subsequent interstate travel, and then a\n failure to register, and that only the last of these events must occur\n after SORNA took effect. The Court instead accepts Carr\u2019s interpre\n tation that the statute does not impose liability unless a person, after\n becoming subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements, travels\n across state lines and then fails to register. That interpretation bet\n ter accords with \u00a72250(a)\u2019s text, the first element of which can only be\n satisfied when a person \u201cis required to register under SORNA.\u201d\n2                       CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    \u00a72250(a)(1). That \u00a72250 sets forth the travel requirement in the pre\n    sent tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) rather than in the past or present perfect\n    (\u201ctraveled\u201d or \u201chas traveled\u201d) reinforces this conclusion. See, e.g.,\n    United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333. And because the Dic\n    tionary Act\u2019s provision that statutory \u201cwords used in the present\n    tense include the future as well as the present,\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a71, implies\n    that the present tense generally does not include the past, regulating\n    a person who \u201ctravels\u201d is not readily understood to encompass a per\n    son whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect. Indeed,\n    there appears to be no instance in which this Court has construed a\n    present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.\n    The statutory context also supports a forward-looking construction of\n    \u201ctravels.\u201d First, the word \u201ctravels\u201d is followed in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) by a\n    series of other present tense verbs\u2014\u201centers or leaves, or resides.\u201d A\n    statute\u2019s \u201cundeviating use of the present tense\u201d is a \u201cstriking\n    indic[ator]\u201d of its \u201cprospective orientation.\u201d Gwaltney of Smithfield,\n    Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 59. Second,\n    the other elements of a \u00a72250 violation are similarly set forth in the\n    present tense: Sections 2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to\n    any person who \u201cis required to register under [SORNA]\u201d and who\n    \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a registration.\u201d (Emphasis\n    added.) Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy\n    \u00a72250\u2019s first two requirements but not the third, it presumably would\n    have varied the verb tenses, as it has in numerous other federal stat\n    utes. Pp. 5\u201311.\n        (b) The Government\u2019s two principal arguments for construing the\n    statute to cover pre-SORNA travel are unpersuasive. Pp. 11\u201318.\n           (1) The claim that such a reading avoids an \u201canomaly\u201d in the\n    statute\u2019s coverage of federal versus state sex offenders is rejected.\n    Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons\n    who fail to adhere to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements: any person\n    who is a sex offender \u201cby reason of a conviction under Federal law\n    . . . ,\u201d \u00a72250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under\n    SORNA who \u201ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce,\u201d\n    \u00a72250(a)(2)(B). The Government\u2019s assertion that \u00a72250(a)(2)\u2019s juris\n    dictional reach should have comparable breadth as applied to both\n    federal and state sex offenders is little more than ipse dixit. It is en\n    tirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Govern\n    ment a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNA\u2019s registra\n    tion requirements by federal sex offenders, who typically would have\n    spent time under federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reason\n    able for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for\n    supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and\n    to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  when, after SORNA\u2019s enactment, they use interstate commerce\n  channels to evade a State\u2019s reach. The Seventh Circuit erred in\n  analogizing \u00a72250 to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g), which prohibits convicted\n  felons from \u201cpossess[ing] in . . . commerc[e] any firearm or ammuni\n  tion.\u201d According to the lower court, \u00a72250(a), like \u00a7922(g), uses\n  movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to es\n  tablish a constitutional predicate for the statute, not to create a tem\n  poral requirement. However, the proper analogy here is not between\n  the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm, but be\n  tween the sex offender who \u201ctravels\u201d and the convicted felon who\n  \u201cpossesses.\u201d The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve\n  as a jurisdictional predicate for \u00a72250, but it is also, like the act of\n  possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim. Pp. 11\u201314.\n        (2) Also unavailing is the Government\u2019s invocation of one of\n  SORNA\u2019s purposes, to locate sex offenders who failed to abide by\n  their registration obligations. The Government\u2019s argument confuses\n  SORNA\u2019s general goal with \u00a72250\u2019s specific purpose. Section 2250 is\n  not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it\n  is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address defi\n  ciencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through\n  the cracks. By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information\n  and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these other provisions, not\n  \u00a72250, stand at the center of Congress\u2019 effort to account for missing\n  sex offenders. While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment\n  under \u00a72250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing\n  sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad\n  goal. Taking account of SORNA\u2019s overall structure, there is little\n  reason to doubt that Congress intended \u00a72250 to do exactly what it\n  says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude\n  SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by traveling in interstate com\n  merce. Pp. 14\u201317.\n        (3) None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evi\n  dence of SORNA\u2019s purpose calls this reading into question. To the\n  contrary, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Report suggests not only\n  that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with Con\n  gress\u2019 goals, but also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to\n  adopt. Pp. 17\u201318.\n     (c) Because \u00a72250 liability cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA\n  travel, the Court need not address whether the statute violates the\n  Ex Post Facto Clause.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Since 1994, federal law has required States, as a condi\ntion for the receipt of certain law enforcement funds, to\nmaintain federally compliant systems for sex-offender\nregistration and community notification. In an effort to\nmake these state schemes more comprehensive, uniform,\nand effective, Congress in 2006 enacted the Sex Offender\nRegistration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) as part\nof the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, Pub.\nL. 109\u2013248, Tit. I, 120 Stat. 590. Among its provisions,\nthe Act established a federal criminal offense covering,\ninter alia, any person who (1) \u201cis required to register\nunder [SORNA],\u201d (2) \u201ctravels in interstate or foreign com\nmerce,\u201d and (3) \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a\nregistration.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a). At issue in this case is\nwhether \u00a72250 applies to sex offenders whose interstate\ntravel occurred prior to SORNA\u2019s effective date and, if so,\nwhether the statute runs afoul of the Constitution\u2019s prohi\nbition on ex post facto laws. See Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3. Liability\nunder \u00a72250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA\ntravel. We therefore do not address the ex post facto\nquestion.\n2                 CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   In May 2004, petitioner Thomas Carr pleaded guilty in\nAlabama state court to first-degree sexual abuse. He was\nsentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but two\nyears suspended. Receiving credit for time previously\nserved, Carr was released on probation on July 3, 2004,\nand he registered as a sex offender as required by Ala\nbama law.\n   In late 2004 or early 2005, prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment,\nCarr relocated from Alabama to Indiana. He did not\ncomply with Indiana\u2019s sex-offender registration require\nments. In July 2007, Carr came to the attention of law\nenforcement in Fort Wayne, Indiana, following his in\nvolvement in a fight.\n   On August 22, 2007, federal prosecutors filed an indict\nment in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Indiana charging Carr with failing to register in\nviolation of \u00a72250. Carr moved to dismiss the indictment,\nasserting that because he traveled to Indiana prior to\nSORNA\u2019s effective date, it would violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause to prosecute him under \u00a72250. The District Court\ndenied Carr\u2019s motion, and Carr entered a conditional\nguilty plea, preserving his right to appeal. He received a\n30-month prison sentence.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit consolidated Carr\u2019s appeal with that of a similarly\nsituated defendant, who, in addition to raising an ex post\nfacto claim, asserted that \u00a72250, by its terms, does not\napply to persons whose interstate travel preceded\nSORNA\u2019s enactment. Beginning with the statutory argu\nment, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a72250 \u201cdoes not\nrequire that the defendant\u2019s travel postdate the Act.\u201d\nUnited States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008). The\ncourt relied principally on its understanding of SORNA\u2019s\nunderlying purpose:\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cThe evil at which [the Act] is aimed is that convicted\n    sex offenders registered in one state might move to\n    another state, fail to register there, and thus leave the\n    public unprotected. The concern is as acute in a case\n    in which the offender moved before the Act was\n    passed as in one in which he moved afterward.\u201d Ibid.\n    (citation omitted).\nThe court drew an analogy to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g), which\nprohibits convicted felons from \u201cpossess[ing] in or affecting\ncommerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.\u201d \u201cThe danger\nposed by such a felon is unaffected by when the gun\ncrossed state lines . . . , and so it need not have crossed\nafter the statute was passed.\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 582 (citing\nScarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563 (1977)).\nAccording to the court, \u00a72250(a), like \u00a7922(g), uses move\nment in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element\n\u201cto establish a constitutional predicate for the statute . . .\nrather than to create a temporal requirement.\u201d 551 F. 3d,\nat 583.\n   Reading \u00a72250 to encompass pre-SORNA travel, the\nSeventh Circuit recognized, created a conflict with the\nTenth Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Husted, 545\nF. 3d 1240 (2008). In holding that \u00a72250\u2019s coverage \u201cis\nlimited to those individuals who travel in interstate com\nmerce after the Act\u2019s effective date,\u201d the Tenth Circuit\nemphasized \u201cCongress\u2019s use of the present tense form of\nthe verb \u2018to travel\u2019 . . . , which according to ordinary Eng\nlish grammar, does not refer to travel that has already\noccurred.\u201d Id., at 1243\u20131244. Rejecting this analysis, the\nSeventh Circuit characterized Congress\u2019 choice of tenses\nas \u201c \u2018not very revealing.\u2019 \u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting Scar\nborough, 431 U. S., at 571).\n   Having dispensed with the statutory question, the\nSeventh Circuit considered the claim of Carr and his co\nappellant that predicating a \u00a72250 prosecution on pre\n4                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSORNA travel violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Reliance\non a defendant\u2019s pre-SORNA travel, the court concluded,\nposes no ex post facto problem so long as the defendant\nhad \u201creasonable time\u201d to register after SORNA took effect\nbut failed to do so. 551 F. 3d, at 585. Noting that Carr\nremained unregistered five months after SORNA became\napplicable to him, the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convic\ntion. Id., at 586\u2013587. The court reversed the conviction of\nCarr\u2019s co-appellant, finding that he had not been given a\nsufficient grace period to register.\n   In view of the division among the Circuits as to the\nmeaning of \u00a72250\u2019s \u201ctravel\u201d requirement,1 we granted\ncertiorari, 557 U. S. __ (2009), to decide the statute\u2019s\napplicability to pre-SORNA travel and, if necessary, to\nconsider the statute\u2019s compliance with the Ex Post Facto\nClause.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 While the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have confronted the question\n\ndirectly, other Circuits have also touched on it. Aligning itself with the\nSeventh Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit has analogized 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a72250(a) to the felon-in-possession statute, \u00a7922(g), and applied it to a\nsex offender who traveled before SORNA became applicable to him.\nUnited States v. Dumont, 555 F. 3d 1288, 1291\u20131292 (2009) (per cu\nriam). In contrast, the Eighth Circuit has stated in dictum that\n\u00a72250(a) \u201cpunishes convicted sex offenders who travel in interstate\ncommerce after the enactment of SORNA.\u201d United States v. May, 535\nF. 3d 912, 920 (2008) (emphasis added).\n  2 There is a separate conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to when\n\nSORNA\u2019s registration requirements became applicable to persons\nconvicted of sex offenses prior to the statute\u2019s enactment. Several\nCircuits, including the Seventh, have taken the position that the Act\ndid not apply to such sex offenders until the Attorney General provided\nfor their inclusion by issuing an interim regulation, 28 CFR \u00a772.3, 72\nFed. Reg. 8897, on February 28, 2007. See, e.g., United States v.\nHatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226\u2013229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Cain, 583\nF. 3d 408, 414\u2013419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578,\n582 (CA7 2008) (case below); United States v. Madera, 528 F. 3d 852,\n857\u2013859 (CA11 2008) (per curiam).

See, e.g., May, 535 F. 3d, at 915\u2013919; United States v. Hinckley,\n550 F. 3d 926, 929\u2013935 (CA10 2008). Because Carr traveled from\nAlabama to Indiana before both the enactment of SORNA and the\nAttorney General\u2019s regulation, we have no occasion to consider whether\na pre-SORNA sex offender whose travel and failure to register occurred\nbetween July 2006 and February 2007 is subject to liability under\n\u00a72250, and we express no view on that question. We similarly express\nno view as to whether \u00a772.3 was properly promulgated\u2014a question that\nhas also divided the Circuits. Compare Cain, 583 F. 3d, at 419\u2013424\n(holding that the Attorney General lacked good cause for issuing the\ninterim regulation without adhering to the notice-and-comment and\npublication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)),\nwith United States v.

A sequential reading, the\nparties recognize, helps to assure a nexus between a de\nfendant\u2019s interstate travel and his failure to register as a\nsex offender. Persons convicted of sex offenses under state\nlaw who fail to register in their State of conviction would\notherwise be subject to federal prosecution under \u00a72250\neven if they had not left the State after being convicted\u2014\nan illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal\ninterest in punishing such state offenders.3\n   While both parties accept that the elements of \u00a72250\nshould be read sequentially, they disagree on the event\nthat sets the sequence in motion. In the Government\u2019s\nview, the statute is triggered by a sex-offense conviction,\nwhich must be followed by interstate travel, and then a\nfailure to register under SORNA. Only the last of these\nevents, the Government maintains, must occur after\nSORNA took effect; the predicate conviction and the travel\nmay both have predated the statute\u2019s enactment. Carr, in\ncontrast, asserts that the statutory sequence begins when\na person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s registration re\nquirements. The person must then travel in interstate\ncommerce and thereafter fail to register. All of these\nevents, Carr avers, necessarily postdate SORNA\u2019s enact\nment because a sex offender could not have been required\nto register under SORNA until SORNA became the law.\n   Carr\u2019s interpretation better accords with the statutory\ntext. By its terms, the first element of \u00a72250(a) can only\nbe satisfied when a person \u201cis required to register under\nthe Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\u201d\n\u00a72250(a)(1) (emphasis added). In an attempt to reconcile\nits preferred construction with the words of the statute,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For persons convicted of sex offenses under federal or Indian tribal\n\nlaw, interstate travel is not a prerequisite to \u00a72250 liability.

To reach this\nconclusion, the Government observes that another provi\nsion of SORNA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(a), states that the Act\u2019s\nregistration requirements apply to \u201csex offender[s].\u201d A\n\u201csex offender\u201d is elsewhere defined as \u201can individual who\nwas convicted of a sex offense.\u201d \u00a716911(1). Thus, as the\nGovernment would have it, Congress used 12 words and\ntwo implied cross-references to establish that the first\nelement of \u00a72250(a) is that a person has been convicted of\na sex offense. Such contortions can scarcely be called\n\u201cshorthand.\u201d It is far more sensible to conclude that Con\ngress meant the first precondition to \u00a72250 liability to be\nthe one it listed first: a \u201crequire[ment] to register under\n[SORNA].\u201d Once a person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s\nregistration requirements, which can occur only after the\nstatute\u2019s effective date, that person can be convicted under\n\u00a72250 if he thereafter travels and then fails to register.4\n  That \u00a72250 sets forth the travel requirement in the\npresent tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) rather than in the past or present\nperfect (\u201ctraveled\u201d or \u201chas traveled\u201d) reinforces the conclu\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Offering  a variation on the Government\u2019s argument, the dissent\ncontends that, \u201c[i]n accordance with current drafting conventions,\n\u00a72250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law went into effect, but\nas of the time when the first act necessary for conviction is committed.\u201d\nPost, at 7 (opinion of ALITO, J.). This occurs, the dissent maintains,\n\u201cwhen an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is\nthat act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.\u201d Ibid.\nThe dissent\u2019s account cannot be squared with the statutory text. \u201c[T]he\nfirst act necessary for conviction\u201d under \u00a72250(a) is not a predicate sex\noffense conviction. It is a requirement \u201cto register under [SORNA].\u201d\n\u00a72250(a)(1). Thus, even if the dissent is correct that legislative drafters\ndo not invariably use the moment of enactment to mark the dividing\nline between covered and uncovered acts, they have clearly done so\nhere.\n8                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsion that preenactment travel falls outside the statute\u2019s\ncompass. Consistent with normal usage, we have fre\nquently looked to Congress\u2019 choice of verb tense to ascer\ntain a statute\u2019s temporal reach. See, e.g., United States v.\nWilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333 (1992) (\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb\ntense is significant in construing statutes\u201d); Gwaltney of\nSmithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484\nU. S. 49, 57 (1987) (\u201cCongress could have phrased its\nrequirement in language that looked to the past . . . , but it\ndid not choose this readily available option\u201d); Barrett v.\nUnited States, 423 U. S. 212, 216 (1976) (observing that\nCongress used the present perfect tense to \u201cdenot[e] an act\nthat has been completed\u201d). The Dictionary Act also as\ncribes significance to verb tense. It provides that, \u201c[i]n\ndetermining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless\nthe context indicates otherwise[,] . . . words used in the\npresent tense include the future as well as the present.\u201d 1\nU. S. C. \u00a71. By implication, then, the Dictionary Act in\nstructs that the present tense generally does not include\nthe past. Accordingly, a statute that regulates a person\nwho \u201ctravels\u201d is not readily understood to encompass a\nperson whose only travel occurred before the statute took\neffect. Indeed, neither the Government nor the dissent\nidentifies any instance in which this Court has construed\na present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenact\nment conduct.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 The\n        Court of Appeals quoted a Ninth Circuit decision for the propo\nsition that \u201c \u2018the present tense is commonly used to refer to past, pre\nsent, and future all at the same time.\u2019 \u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting\nCoalition for Clean Air v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 971 F. 2d 219, 225\n(CA9 1992)). Neither court offered examples of such usage. Perhaps,\nas the Dictionary Act itself recognizes, there may be instances in which\n\u201ccontext\u201d supports this sort of omnitemporality, but it is not the typical\nunderstanding of the present tense in either normal discourse or\nstatutory construction. Taken in context, the word \u201ctravels\u201d as it\nappears in \u00a72250 is indistinguishable from the present-tense verbs that\nappear in myriad other criminal statutes to proscribe conduct on a\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In this instance, the statutory context strongly supports\na forward-looking construction of \u201ctravels.\u201d First, the\nword \u201ctravels\u201d is followed in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) by a series of\nother present tense verbs\u2014\u201centers or leaves, or resides in,\nIndian country.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This Court has previ\nously described a statute\u2019s \u201cundeviating use of the present\ntense\u201d as a \u201cstriking indic[ator]\u201d of its \u201cprospective orien\ntation.\u201d Gwaltney, 484 U. S., at 59. The Seventh Circuit\nthought otherwise, reasoning that it would \u201cmak[e] no\nsense\u201d for \u201ca sex offender who has resided in Indian coun\ntry since long before the Act was passed [to be] subject to\nthe Act but not someone who crossed state lines before the\nAct was passed.\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583. As a textual matter,\nhowever, it is the Seventh Circuit\u2019s approach that makes\nlittle sense: If \u201ctravels\u201d means \u201ctraveled\u201d (i.e., a person\n\u201ctravels\u201d if he crossed state lines before SORNA\u2019s enact\nment), then the only way to avoid an incongruity among\nneighboring verbs would be to construe the phrase \u201cre\nsides i[n] Indian country\u201d to encompass persons who once\nresided in Indian country but who left before SORNA\u2019s\nenactment and have not since returned\u2014an implausible\nreading that neither the Seventh Circuit, nor the Govern\nment, nor the dissent endorses.\n   Second, the other elements of a \u00a72250 violation are\nsimilarly set forth in the present tense.            Sections\n2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who\n\u201cis required to register under [SORNA]\u201d and who \u201cknow\ningly fails to register or update a registration as required\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprospective basis. Examining a criminal law with a travel element\nsimilar to the one at issue here, the Ninth Circuit itself recently agreed\nthat \u201cthe present tense verb \u2018travels,\u2019 most sensibly read, does not refer\nto travel that occurred in the past\u2014that is, before the enactment of the\nstatute.\u201d United States v. Jackson, 480 F. 3d 1014, 1019 (CA9 2007)\n(interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a72423(c), which imposes criminal penalties on\n\u201c[a]ny United States citizen . . . who travels in foreign commerce, and\nengages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person\u201d).\n10                    CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nby [SORNA].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Government ac\ncepts that this last element\u2014a knowing failure to register\nor update a registration\u2014must postdate SORNA\u2019s enact\nment. Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to\nsatisfy the first two requirements of \u00a72250 but not the\nthird, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses to\nconvey this meaning. Indeed, numerous federal statutes\nuse the past-perfect tense to describe one or more ele\nments of a criminal offense when coverage of preenact\nment events is intended.         See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7249(a)(2)(B)(iii) (Supp. 2010) (proscribing hate crimes in\nwhich \u201cthe defendant employs a firearm, dangerous\nweapon, explosive or incendiary device, or other weapon\nthat has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d (em\nphasis added)); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9) (2006 ed.) (proscrib\ning firearm possession or transport by any person \u201cwho\nhas been convicted\u201d of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence (emphasis added)); \u00a72252(a)(2) (2006\ned., Supp. II) (making it unlawful for any person to receive\nor distribute a visual depiction of a minor engaging in\nsexually explicit conduct that \u201chas been mailed, or has\nbeen shipped or transported in or affecting interstate or\nforeign commerce\u201d (emphasis added)). The absence of\nsimilar phrasing here provides powerful evidence that\n\u00a72250 targets only postenactment travel.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent identifies several \u201cSORNA provisions that plainly use\n\nthe present tense to refer to events that . . . may have occurred before\nSORNA took effect.\u201d Post, at 10. All of these examples appear in 42\nU. S. C. \u00a716911, a definitional section that merely elucidates the\nmeaning of certain statutory terms and proscribes no conduct. All but\ntwo of the provisions, moreover, rely on the term \u201csex offender,\u201d which\n\u00a716911(1) defines to mean \u201can individual who was convicted of a sex\noffense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The remaining provisions are \u00a716911(7),\nwhich simply uses \u201cinvolves\u201d rather than \u201cinvolved\u201d to define whether a\nprior conviction qualifies as a \u201cspecified offense against a minor,\u201d and\n\u00a716911(8), which makes plain that its present-tense reference to an\noffender\u2019s age refers to age \u201cat the time of the offense.\u201d These examples\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

According to the Government, these cate\ngories correspond to \u201ctwo alternate sources of power to\nachieve Congress\u2019s aim of broadly registering sex offend\ners.\u201d Id., at 22. Placing pre-SORNA travelers within the\nstatute\u2019s coverage, the Government maintains, \u201censures\nthat the jurisdictional reach of Section 2250(a)(2) has a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthus provide scant support for the proposition that \u00a72250 uses \u201ctravels\u201d\nto refer to pre-SORNA travel. Given the well-established presumption\nagainst retroactivity and, in the criminal context, the constitutional bar\non ex post facto laws, it cannot be the case that a statutory prohibition\nset forth in the present tense applies by default to acts completed before\nthe statute\u2019s enactment. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U. S. 694,\n701 (2000) (\u201cAbsent a clear statement of that intent, we do not give\nretroactive effect to statutes burdening private interests\u201d).\n12                 CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncomparable breadth as applied to both federal and state\nsex offenders.\u201d Id., at 21.\n   The Government\u2019s pronouncement that \u00a72250 should\nhave an \u201cequally broad sweep\u201d with respect to federal and\nstate offenders, id., at 22, is little more than ipse dixit.\nHad Congress intended to subject any unregistered state\nsex offender who has ever traveled in interstate commerce\nto federal prosecution under \u00a72250, it easily could have\nadopted language to that effect. That it declined to do so\nindicates that Congress instead chose to handle federal\nand state sex offenders differently. There is nothing\n\u201canomal[ous]\u201d about such a choice. To the contrary, it is\nentirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the\nFederal Government a special role in ensuring compliance\nwith SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by federal sex\noffenders\u2014persons who typically would have spent time\nunder federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reason\nable for Congress to have given the States primary re\nsponsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance\namong state sex offenders and to have subjected such\noffenders to federal criminal liability only when, after\nSORNA\u2019s enactment, they use the channels of interstate\ncommerce in evading a State\u2019s reach.\n   In this regard, it is notable that the federal sex-offender\nregistration laws have, from their inception, expressly\nrelied on state-level enforcement. Indeed, when it initially\nset national standards for state sex-offender registration\nprograms in 1994, Congress did not include any federal\ncriminal liability. Congress instead conditioned certain\nfederal funds on States\u2019 adoption of \u201ccriminal penalties\u201d on\nany person \u201crequired to register under a State program . . .\nwho knowingly fails to so register and keep such registra\ntion current.\u201d Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children\nand Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Pub.

C.\n\u00a7\u00a714072(g)(3), (i).7 The prospective orientation of this\nprovision is apparent. No statutory gap necessitated\ncoverage of unregistered offenders who \u201cchange[d] ad\ndress\u201d before the statute\u2019s enactment; the prosecution of\nsuch persons remained the province of the States.\n   In enacting SORNA, Congress preserved this basic\nallocation of enforcement responsibilities. To strengthen\nstate enforcement of registration requirements, Congress\nestablished, as a funding condition, that \u201c[e]ach jurisdic\ntion, other than a Federally recognized Indian tribe, shall\nprovide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term\nof imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure\nof a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this\nsubchapter.\u201d \u00a716913(e).8 Meanwhile, Congress in \u00a72250\nexposed to federal criminal liability, with penalties of up\nto 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, persons required to register\nunder SORNA over whom the Federal Government has a\ndirect supervisory interest or who threaten the efficacy of\nthe statutory scheme by traveling in interstate commerce.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Pre-SORNA    law also exposed to federal criminal liability any person\nwhose State \u201cha[d] not established a minimally sufficient sexual\noffender registration program\u201d and who was thus required to register\nwith the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a714072(c), (g)(2), (i). SORNA does not include a similar FBI registra\ntion requirement, presumably because, by the time of the statute\u2019s\nenactment, \u201cevery State . . . had enacted some\u201d type of registration\nsystem.

S., at 564 (quoting 18\nU. S. C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1970 ed.)), did not require the\nGovernment to prove postenactment movement of the\nfirearm across state lines. According to the Court, Con\ngress had given \u201cno indication of any concern with either\nthe movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time\nof acquisition.\u201d 431 U. S., at 572. Its aim was simply \u201cto\nkeep guns out of the hands of\u201d convicted felons, ibid., and,\nby using the phrase \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce,\u201d\nit invoked the full breadth of its Commerce Clause author\nity to achieve that end. No one in Scarborough disputed,\nhowever, that the act of possession had to occur post\nenactment; a felon who \u201cpossess[ed]\u201d a firearm only pre\nenactment was plainly outside the statute\u2019s sweep. In this\ncase, the proper analogy is not, as the Seventh Circuit\nsuggested, between the travel of a sex offender and the\nmovement of a firearm; it is between the sex offender who\n\u201ctravels\u201d and the convicted felon who \u201cpossesses.\u201d The act\nof travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a juris\ndictional predicate for \u00a72250, but it is also, like the act of\npossession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.\n                              B\n  In a final effort to justify its position, the Government\ninvokes one of SORNA\u2019s underlying purposes: to locate sex\noffenders who had failed to abide by their registration\nobligations.   SORNA, the Government observes, was\nmotivated at least in part by Congress\u2019 concern about\nthese \u201cmissing\u201d sex offenders\u2014a problem the House\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCommittee on the Judiciary expressly linked to interstate\ntravel: \u201cThe most significant enforcement issue in the sex\noffender program is that over 100,000 sex offenders, or\nnearly one-fifth in the Nation[,] are \u2018missing,\u2019 meaning\nthey have not complied with sex offender registration\nrequirements. This typically occurs when the sex offender\nmoves from one State to another.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013\n218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The goal of tracking down missing\nsex offenders, the Government maintains, \u201cis surely better\nserved by making Section 2250 applicable to them in their\nnew States of residence immediately than by waiting for\nthem to travel in interstate commerce and fail to register\nyet again.\u201d Brief for United States 23\u201324. The Court of\nAppeals expressed a similar view. See 551 F. 3d, at 582.9\n   The Government\u2019s argument confuses a general goal of\nSORNA with the specific purpose of \u00a72250. Section 2250\nis not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Also making this point, the dissent maintains that \u201c[i]nterpreting\n\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment travel severely impairs\n\u00a72250(a)\u2019s effectiveness\u201d by \u201cplac[ing] beyond the reach of the federal\ncriminal laws\u201d \u201cthe many sex offenders who had managed to avoid pre\nexisting registration regimes.\u201d Post, at 14. The dissent sees \u201cno appar\nent reason why Congress would have wanted to impose such a require\nment.\u201d Ibid. Yet the dissent approves an even greater impairment.\nAddressing a dispute we leave unresolved, see n. 2, supra, the dissent\nwould hold that, in enacting SORNA, \u201cCongress remained neutral on\nthe question whether the Act reaches those with pre-SORNA sex\noffense convictions.\u201d Post, at 10. The dissent\u2019s view, in other words, is\nthat SORNA does not apply of its own force to any sex offenders con\nvicted prior to the statute\u2019s enactment\u2014a reading wholly inconsistent\nwith the dissent\u2019s description of SORNA as \u201ca response to a dangerous\ngap in the then-existing sex-offender-registration laws.\u201d Post, at 13. If,\nas the dissent accepts, Congress left open the possibility that no preen\nactment offenders would face liability under \u00a72250, then it is certainly\nnot unreasonable to conclude that Congress limited the statute\u2019s\ncoverage to offenders who travel after its enactment. Indeed, it is\nstrange to think that Congress might have enacted a statute that\ndeclined to cover pre-SORNA offenders but nevertheless covered pre-\nSORNA travel.\n16                CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme\nenacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that had\nenabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a716901 (\u201cCongress in this chapter establishes a\ncomprehensive national system for the registration of [sex]\noffenders\u201d). Among its many provisions, SORNA instructs\nStates to maintain sex-offender registries that compile an\narray of information about sex offenders, \u00a716914; to make\nthis information publicly available online, \u00a716918; to share\nthe information with other jurisdictions and with the\nAttorney General for inclusion in a comprehensive na\ntional sex-offender registry, \u00a7\u00a716919\u201316921; and to \u201cpro\nvide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of\nimprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure of\na sex offender to comply with the requirements of this\nsubchapter,\u201d \u00a716913(e). Sex offenders, in turn, are re\nquired to \u201cregister, and keep the registration current, in\neach jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the\noffender is an employee, and where the offender is a stu\ndent,\u201d \u00a716913(a), and to appear in person periodically to\n\u201callow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph, and\nverify the information in each registry in which that of\nfender is required to be registered,\u201d \u00a716916. By facilitat\ning the collection of sex-offender information and its dis\nsemination among jurisdictions, these provisions, not\n\u00a72250, stand at the center of Congress\u2019 effort to account for\nmissing sex offenders.\n   Knowing that Congress aimed to reduce the number of\nnoncompliant sex offenders thus tells us little about the\nspecific policy choice Congress made in enacting \u00a72250.\nWhile subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment\nunder \u00a72250 may well be consistent with the aim of find\ning missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no\nway frustrates that broad goal.         Taking account of\nSORNA\u2019s overall structure, we have little reason to doubt\nthat Congress intended \u00a72250 to do exactly what it says:\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Cf. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508\nU. S. 248, 261 (1993) (\u201c[V]ague notions of a statute\u2019s \u2018basic\npurpose\u2019 are . . . inadequate to overcome the words of its\ntext regarding the specific issue under consideration\u201d).\n                                C\n   None of the legislative materials the Government cites\nas evidence of SORNA\u2019s purpose calls this reading into\nquestion. To the contrary, the report of the House Judici\nary Committee suggests not only that a prohibition on\npostenactment travel is consonant with Congress\u2019 goals,\nbut also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to adopt.\nAs the Government acknowledges, the bill under consid\neration by the Committee contained a version of \u00a72250\nthat \u201cwould not have reached pre-enactment interstate\ntravel.\u201d Brief for United States 24, n. 9. This earlier\nversion imposed federal criminal penalties on any person\nwho \u201creceives a notice from an official that such person is\nrequired to register under [SORNA] and . . . thereafter\ntravels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or\nleaves Indian country.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013218, pt. 1, at\n9; see also id., at 26 (\u201c[S]ex offenders will now face Federal\nprosecution . . . if they cross a State line and fail to comply\nwith the sex offender registration and notification re\nquirements contained in the legislation\u201d). Yet this did not\nstop the Committee from describing its legislation as a\nsolution to the problem of missing sex offenders. See id.,\nat 23\u201324, 26, 45\u201346. The Government identifies nothing\nin the legislative record to suggest that, in modifying this\nlanguage during the course of the legislative process,\nCongress intended to alter the statute\u2019s temporal sweep.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Among other changes, Congress eliminated the language that con\n\nditioned liability on proof of notice, and it removed the word \u201cthereaf\nter,\u201d presumably as redundant in light of the sequential structure of the\n18                 CARR v.

S. C. \u00a72250(a), a provision of the Sex Offender Registra\ntion and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) that is designed\nto prevent dangerous sex offenders from evading registra\ntion requirements. SORNA requires convicted sex offend\ners to register, and to keep their registrations current, in\neach jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a716913, and the provision at issue here, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a72250(a), makes it a crime for a convicted sex\noffender who moves in interstate commerce1 to fail to\nabide by the Act\u2019s registration requirements. The question\nthat we must decide is whether \u00a72250(a) applies only to\nthose sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce\nafter SORNA became law or whether the statute also\nreaches sex offenders, like petitioner, who were convicted2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 2250(a) also applies to persons with federal sex-offense con\n\nvictions, those who travel in foreign commerce, and those who enter,\nleave, or reside in Indian country. For convenience, I will refer in this\nopinion solely to interstate travel.\n  2 The Court holds only that \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) does not apply to a person\n\nwho moved in interstate commerce before SORNA took effect. The\nCourt does not address the separate question whether \u00a72250(a) may\nvalidly be applied to a person who was convicted of a qualifying offense\nbefore SORNA was enacted. Congress delegated to the Attorney\nGeneral the authority to decide whether the Act\u2019s registration require\n2                    CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand traveled before SORNA took effect but violated the\nregistration requirement after that date.\n   The Court\u2019s answer is that \u00a72250(a) applies only to sex\noffenders who moved from State to State after SORNA\nbecame law. The Court reaches this conclusion for two\nreasons: (1) the verb tense used in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B); and (2)\nthe sequence in which the elements of the offense are\nlisted.\n   As I will attempt to show, the Court\u2019s textual arguments\nare thoroughly unsound. And the conclusion that the\nCourt reaches makes no sense. To appreciate the folly of\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation, consider the following two\ncases.\n   The first involves a situation in which, for present pur\nposes, I assume that \u00a72250(a) applies.3 A man convicted\nin State A for sexual abuse is released from custody in\nthat State and then, after the enactment of SORNA,\nmoves to State B and fails to register as required by State\nB law. Section 2250(a) makes this offender\u2019s failure to\nregister in State B a federal crime because his interstate\nmovement frustrates SORNA\u2019s registration requirements.\nBecause this offender is convicted and then released from\ncustody in State A, the State A authorities know of his\npresence in their State and are thus in a position to try to\nensure that he remains registered. At the time of his\nrelease, they can ascertain where he intends to live, and\nthey can make sure that he registers as required by state\nlaw. Thereafter, they can periodically check the address\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nments\u2014and thus \u00a72250(a)\u2019s criminal penalties\u2014should apply to per\nsons in the latter category, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(d), and the Attorney\nGeneral has promulgated a regulation providing that they do, 72 Fed.\nReg. 8897 (2007) (codified at 28 CFR \u00a772.3 (2009)). Because the Court\ndoes not address the validity of this regulation, I proceed on the as\nsumption that 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA\nsex-offense convictions.\n  3 See n. 2, supra.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nat which he is registered to confirm that he still resides\nthere. And even if he moves without warning to some\nother address in the State, they can try to track him down.\nOnce this offender leaves State A, however, the authorities\nin that State are severely limited in their ability to moni\ntor his movements. And because the State B authorities\nhave no notice of his entry into their State, they are at a\ngreat disadvantage in trying to enforce State B\u2019s registra\ntion law. Congress enacted \u00a72250(a) in order to punish\nand deter interstate movement that seriously undermines\nthe enforcement of sex-offender-registration laws.\n   The second case is the same as the first in all respects\nexcept that the sex offender travels from State A to State\nB before SORNA\u2019s enactment. In other words, the sex\noffender is convicted and later released in State A; prior to\nSORNA\u2019s enactment, he moves to State B; and then, after\nSORNA takes effects, he fails to register in State B, as\nSORNA requires.\n   Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to\ntreat the second case any differently from the first? In\nboth cases, a sex offender\u2019s interstate movement frustrates\nenforcement of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. In\nboth cases, as a result of that interstate travel, the sex\noffender\u2019s new neighbors in State B are unaware of the\npresence of a potentially dangerous person in their com\nmunity, and the State B law enforcement authorities are\nhampered in their ability to protect the public. The second\ncase is the case now before the Court, and the Court offers\nno plausible explanation why Congress might have\nwanted to treat this case any differently from the first.\n   If the text of \u00a72250(a) commanded this result, we would,\nof course, be obligated to heed that command. But the text\nof \u00a72250(a) dictates no such thing. On the contrary, when\nproperly read, it reaches both cases.\n   Section 2250(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:\n4                  CARR v.

And\npetitioner\u2019s argument fails because it begs the relevant\nquestion. Petitioner belabors the obvious\u2014that the pre\nsent tense is not used to refer to events that occurred in\nthe past\u2014but studiously avoids the critical question: At\nwhat point in time does \u00a72250(a) speak? Does it speak as\nof the time when SORNA took effect? Or does it speak as\nof the time when the proscribed conduct occurs? Without\nknowing the point in time at which the law speaks, it is\nimpossible to tell what is past and what is present or\nfuture.\n  The unspoken premise of petitioner\u2019s argument is that\n\u00a72250(a) speaks as of the time when it became law. And if\nthat premise is accepted, it follows that the use of the\npresent tense in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) means that the requisite\ninterstate travel must occur after, not before, SORNA took\neffect. Petitioner\u2019s premise, however, flies in the face of\nthe widely accepted modern legislative drafting convention\nthat a law should not be read to speak as of the date of\nenactment. The United States Senate Legislative Draft\ning Manual directly addresses this point: \u201cA legislative\nprovision speaks as of any date on which it is read (rather\nthan as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).\u201d\nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Draft\ning Manual \u00a7103(a), p. 4 (1997) (emphasis added).

The majority of rules have a continuing effect\nin that they apply over time. They speak at the time of\nreading, not merely at the time of their adoption. The\npresent tense therefore includes the future tense\u201d).\n   Once it is recognized that \u00a72250(a) should not be read as\nspeaking as of the date when SORNA went into effect,\npetitioner\u2019s argument about the use of the present tense\ncollapses. In accordance with current drafting conven\ntions, \u00a72250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law\nwent into effect, but as of the time when the first act\nnecessary for conviction is committed. In the case of\n\u00a72250(a), that occurs when an individual is convicted of a\nqualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the\nrequirement to register under SORNA.4 For present\npurposes, we must proceed on the assumption that this\nevent may have occurred before SORNA was enacted.\nViewed as of the time when such a pre-SORNA conviction\ntakes place, every subsequent act, including movement\nfrom State to State, occurs in the future and is thus prop\nerly described using the present tense. Accordingly,\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B)\u2019s use of the present tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) sup\nports the application of the statute to a sex offender, like\npetitioner, who moved from State to State after conviction\nbut before SORNA went into effect.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Under  42 U.

The Court relies on the artificial argument\nthat the first act necessary for conviction under 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) is\nthe failure to register, ante, at 6\u20137, and n. 4, but in real-world terms the\nfirst necessary act is plainly the commission of a qualifying offense.\n   5 Contrary to the Court\u2019s interpretation, see ante, at 8\u20139, Gwaltney of\n\nSmithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49\n(1987), does not support petitioner\u2019s argument. Gwaltney involved a\ncivil action brought under \u00a7505 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71365(a), which authorizes suit against any person \u201calleged to be in\n8                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              C\n\n  Petitioner\u2019s present-tense argument is particularly\nperverse in light of the context in which \u00a72250(a) was\nadopted. When SORNA was enacted, Congress elected not\nto decide for itself whether the Act\u2019s registration require\nments\u2014and thus \u00a72250(a)\u2019s criminal penalties\u2014would\napply to persons who had been convicted of qualifying sex\noffenses before SORNA took effect. Instead, Congress\ndelegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide\nthat question. See \u00a7113(d), 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a716913(d) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall have the authority\nto specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I\nof SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enact\nment of this Act\u201d).6 Pursuant to this delegation, the At\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nviolation\u201d of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\npermit. In Gwaltney, the permit holder had violated its permit between\n1981 and 1984, but the permit holder claimed that it had ceased all\nviolations by the time the suit was filed. 484 U. S., at 53\u201355. This\nCourt held that the phrase \u201calleged to be in violation\u201d showed that the\nprovision was meant to apply only where an ongoing violation is al\nleged. Id., at 59.\n  The provision at issue in Gwaltney differs from \u00a72250(a) in that it\nspecifies the relevant temporal point of reference, namely, the point in\ntime when the allegation of an ongoing violation is made. Section\n2250(a) contains no similar specification. Moreover, the Gwaltney\nCourt did not read the provision at issue there as speaking at the time\nwhen the provision was enacted. As noted above, however, the silent\npremise of petitioner\u2019s argument is that \u00a72250(a) must be read as\nspeaking as of the time of SORNA\u2019s enactment.\n  6 To be sure, at least two Courts of Appeals have held that SORNA\u2019s\n\nregistration requirements apply by the Act\u2019s own terms to those indi\nviduals with sex-offense convictions that predate SORNA\u2019s enactment.\nSee United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d 926, 929\u2013935 (CA10 2008);\nUnited States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912, 918\u2013919 (CA8 2008). Other\nCourts of Appeals, however, have disagreed, reasoning that SORNA\u2019s\nexplicit grant of authority to the Attorney General to determine the\nAct\u2019s applicability to offenders with pre-SORNA convictions implies\nthat the Act would not apply to those sex offenders absent the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s regulation. See, e.g., United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d 408,\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntorney General in 2007 issued an interim rule providing\nthat SORNA applies to pre-enactment convictions. 72\nFed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \u00a772.3).7\n   Petitioner contends that, if Congress had wanted to\nmake \u00a72250(a) applicable to sex offenders who traveled in\ninterstate commerce before SORNA took effect, Congress\ncould have referred in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to a person who\n\u201ctraveled,\u201d \u201chas traveled,\u201d or, at the time of the statute\u2019s\nenactment, \u201chad traveled\u201d in interstate commerce. Brief\nfor Petitioner 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Any\nsuch phrasing, however, would have strongly suggested\nthat \u00a72250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex\noffense convictions\u2014the very question that Congress chose\nnot to decide but instead to leave for the Attorney General.\n   A brief explanation is needed to make clear why word\ning \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) in the past tense (or the present perfect\nor past perfect tense) would have had such an effect. The\nCourt and I agree that \u00a72250(a) applies only to persons\nwho travel in interstate commerce after they are convicted\nof a qualifying sex offense. See ante, at 6; infra, at 11\u201312.\nTherefore, if \u00a72250(a) had been phrased in the past tense\n(or the present perfect or past perfect tense), it would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n414\u2013415, 419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226\u2013\n229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008)\n(case below); United States v. Madera, 528 F. 3d 852, 856\u2013859 (CA11\n2008). Those Courts of Appeals in the latter group, in my view, have\nthe better of the argument. Section 113(d) of SORNA delegates to the\nAttorney General the \u201cauthority to specify the applicability of the\nrequirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the\nenactment of [the] Act.\u201d 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(d). The clear\nnegative implication of that delegation is that, without such a determi\nnation by the Attorney General, the Act would not apply to those with\npre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.\n  7 Although not controlling, it is worth noting that one of the two ex\n\namples the Attorney General included in his February 2007 rule\ncontemplated that pre-SORNA travel would be sufficient to satisfy\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B)\u2019s interstate-travel requirement. See 28 CFR \u00a772.3\n(Example 2).\n10                   CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nseem necessarily to follow that the provision reaches pre-\nSORNA convictions. By using the present tense, Congress\nremained neutral on the question whether the Act reaches\nthose with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions and left\nthat question open for the Attorney General.\n   The conclusion that \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) embraces pre-\nSORNA travel is reinforced by the presence of quite a few\nother SORNA provisions that plainly use the present\ntense to refer to events that, as a result of the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s regulation, may have occurred before SORNA\ntook effect. For example, an individual may qualify as a\n\u201ctier II sex offender\u201d under the Act if, among other things,\nhis sex offense \u201cinvolves . . . (i) use of a minor in sexual\nperformance; (ii) solicitation of a minor to practice prosti\ntution; or (iii) production or distribution of child pornogra\nphy.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a716911(3)(B) (emphasis added); see also\n\u00a716911(4)(B) (offense \u201cinvolves kidnapping a minor\u201d (em\nphasis added)); \u00a716911(7) (offense \u201cinvolves\u201d certain speci\nfied conduct). Similarly, a sex offender can qualify as a\n\u201ctier II sex offender\u201d if his sex offense \u201coccurs after the\noffender becomes a tier I sex offender.\u201d \u00a716911(3)(C) (em\nphasis added); see also \u00a716911(4)(C) (offense \u201coccurs after\nthe offender becomes a tier II sex offender\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). A juvenile adjudication, moreover, may qualify as\na conviction for purposes of the Act only if, among other\nthings, the \u201coffender is 14 years of age or older at the time\nof the offense.\u201d \u00a716911(8) (emphasis added).8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 That many of these provisions rely on \u00a716911(1)\u2019s definition of the\n\nterm \u201csex offender\u201d changes nothing. See ante, at 10, n. 6. Had the\nAttorney General not exercised his discretion to make SORNA\u2019s regis\ntration requirements applicable to those with pre-SORNA sex-offense\nconvictions, all of these provisions would have applied to only pos\ntenactment conduct\u2014notwithstanding \u00a716911(1)\u2019s reference to \u201can\nindividual who was convicted of a sex offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But\nnow that the Attorney General has so exercised his discretion, all of\nthese present-tense-phrased provisions necessarily must be interpreted\nas reaching pre-enactment conduct. The same conclusion should follow\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress cast all of these provisions in the present\ntense, but now that the Attorney General has made\nSORNA applicable to individuals with pre-SORNA sex\noffense convictions, all of these provisions must necessar\nily be interpreted as embracing pre-enactment conduct.\n                               II\n   The Court\u2019s second reason for holding that 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a72250(a) reaches only post-SORNA travel is based on the\nsequence in which the elements of \u00a72250(a) are listed. The\nCourt concludes (and I agree) that the first listed element\n(subsection (a)(1) (\u201cis required to register under the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act\u201d)) cannot have\nbeen violated until the Act took effect. The Court then\nreasons that the third listed element (subsection (a)(2)(B)\n(\u201ctravels in interstate . . . commerce\u201d)) must be violated\nafter the first. See ante, at 6. The Court explains: \u201cPer\nsons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to\nregister in their State of conviction would otherwise be\nsubject to federal prosecution under \u00a72250 even if they\nhad not left the State after being convicted\u2014an illogical\nresult given the absence of any obvious federal interest in\npunishing such state offenders.\u201d Ibid. In other words, the\nCourt reasons that it would be illogical to interpret the\nstatute as reaching a person who first moves from State A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith respect to 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a)(2)(B).\n  Additionally, I do not suggest that the \u201cdefault\u201d rule is that provi\nsions written in the present tense apply to past conduct. To the con\ntrary, I had thought it an uncontroversial proposition of statutory\ninterpretation that statutes must be interpreted in context. See, e.g.,\nUnited States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America,\nInc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993); see also 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. And when\n\u00a72250(a) is read with an eye to the context in which SORNA was\nenacted, it becomes quite clear that \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) should be inter\npreted as reaching pre-enactment travel. Giving effect to those contex\ntual indicators, moreover, does not offend the presumption against\nretroactivity or the Ex Post Facto Clause. See n. 10, infra.\n12                CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto State B, then commits and is convicted of a qualifying\nsex offense in State B, and subsequently, upon release\nfrom custody in State B, fails to register as required under\nthe law of that State.\n   I agree with the Court that there is a good argument\nthat \u00a72250(a) should not be read to apply to such a case,\nwhere there is little if any connection between the of\nfender\u2019s prior interstate movement and his subsequent\nfailure to register. In the two hypothetical cases discussed\nat the beginning of this opinion, the offender\u2019s interstate\nmovement seriously frustrated the ability of the law en\nforcement authorities in his new State (State B) to enforce\nits registration requirements. By contrast, where an\noffender\u2019s interstate movement predates his sex offense\nand conviction, his interstate movement has little if any\neffect on the ability of the law enforcement authorities in\nState B to enforce that State\u2019s laws. When a sex offender\nis released from custody in State B, the ability of the State\nB authorities to enforce that State\u2019s registration laws\nwould appear to be the same regardless of whether that\noffender had lived his entire life in that State or had\nmoved to the State prior to committing the offense for\nwhich he was convicted. Accordingly, it can be argued\nthat Congress cannot have meant to reach this situation.\nAs the Seventh Circuit put it, \u201c[s]ince the statutory aim is\nto prevent a convicted sex offender from circumventing\nregistration by leaving the state in which he is registered,\nit can be argued that the travel must postdate the convic\ntion.\u201d United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008).\nIt can also be argued that a broader construction would\nmean that Congress exceeded its authority under the\nCommerce Clause. See Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 16\u201317.\n   What the Court\u2019s argument shows, however, is not that\nthe interstate travel required by \u00a72250(a) must come after\nSORNA\u2019s enactment. Rather, what the Court\u2019s argument\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsuggests is that the interstate travel must come after the\nsex-offense conviction. And because, under the regulation\npromulgated by the Attorney General, \u00a72250(a) reaches\npre-SORNA convictions, this argument does not support\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that the interstate travel needed\nunder \u00a72250(a) must have occurred after SORNA was\nenacted.\n                             III\n   When an interpretation of a statutory text leads to a\nresult that makes no sense, a court should at a minimum\ngo back and verify that the textual analysis is correct.\nHere, not only are the Court\u2019s textual arguments unsound\nfor the reasons explained above, but the indefensible\nresults produced by the Court\u2019s interpretation should have\nled the Court to doublecheck its textual analysis.\n   SORNA was a response to a dangerous gap in the then\nexisting sex-offender-registration laws. In the years prior\nto SORNA\u2019s enactment, the Nation had been shocked by\ncases in which children had been raped and murdered by\npersons who, unbeknownst to their neighbors or the police,\nwere convicted sex offenders. In response, Congress and\nstate legislatures passed laws requiring the registration of\nsex offenders. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89\u201390\n(2003); Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and\nSexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Tit. 17, 108\nStat. 2038; Megan\u2019s Law, 110 Stat. 1345. Despite those\nefforts, by 2006 an estimated 100,000 convicted sex of\nfenders\u2014nearly one-fifth of the Nation\u2019s total sex-offender\npopulation\u2014remained unregistered. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013\n218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The principal problem, a House\nReport determined, was that sex offenders commonly\nmoved from one State to another and then failed to regis\nter in their new State of residence. Ibid. In other words,\ninterstate travel was dangerously undermining the effec\ntiveness of state sex-offender-registration laws.\n14                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Interpreting \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment\ntravel severely impairs \u00a72250(a)\u2019s effectiveness. As inter\npreted by the Court, \u00a72250(a) applies to a pre-SORNA sex\noffender only if that offender traveled in interstate com\nmerce at some point after SORNA\u2019s enactment. As the\nexamples discussed at the beginning of this opinion illus\ntrate, however, there is no apparent reason why Congress\nwould have wanted to impose such a requirement. To the\ncontrary, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, the many sex\noffenders who had managed to avoid pre-existing registra\ntion regimes, mainly by moving from one State to another\nbefore SORNA\u2019s enactment, are placed beyond the reach of\nthe federal criminal laws. It surely better serves the\nenforcement of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements to\napply \u00a72250(a) to all pre-SORNA sex offenders, regardless\nof whether their interstate travel occurred before or after\nthe statute\u2019s enactment.\n   The Court provides only a weak defense of the result its\nanalysis produces. The Court suggests that enhanced\ninformation collection and sharing and state enforcement\nof registration laws were the sole weapons that Congress\nchose to wield in order to deal with those convicted sex\noffenders whose whereabouts were unknown when\nSORNA was passed. See ante, at 14\u201316. I see no basis for\nthis conclusion. There can be no dispute that the enact\nment of \u00a72250(a) shows that Congress did not think these\nmeasures were sufficient to deal with persons who have\nqualifying sex-offense convictions and who move from\nState to State after SORNA\u2019s enactment. And in light of\nthat congressional judgment, is there any plausible reason\nto think that Congress concluded that these same meas\nures would be adequate for those with qualifying sex\noffense convictions who had already disappeared at the\ntime of SORNA\u2019s enactment?9 The Court has no answer,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 9 Contrary   to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see ante, at 15, n. 9, it is no an\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

Of course, that delegation\ncreated the possibility that the Attorney General would decide that\n\u00a72250(a) should not apply to such offenders, and if he had so decided it\nwould likely follow that post-SORNA interstate travel would also be\nrequired. (This is the case because, as previously explained, there is a\nstrong argument that \u00a72250(a) requires interstate travel that comes\nafter a qualifying conviction.)\n  Now that the Attorney General has decided that \u00a72250(a) reaches\npersons with pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, however, the relevant\nquestion is this: Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted\nto draw a distinction between (1) persons with pre-SORNA convictions\nand pre-SORNA travel and (2) persons with pre-SORNA convictions\nand post-SORNA travel? And to this question, the Court offers no\nplausible answer.\n  10 Petitioner makes the additional argument that interpreting\n\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to reach pre-enactment travel renders the statute an\nunlawful ex post facto law. See U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3. Petitioner\nremained unregistered in Indiana five months after the promulgation\nof the regulation making SORNA applicable to persons with pre-\nSORNA sex-offense convictions. For essentially the reasons explained\nby the Court of Appeals, see United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d, at 585\u2013\n587, I would reject petitioner\u2019s ex post facto argument.\n",

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u20131301. Argued February 24, 2010\u2014Decided June 1, 2010\nEnacted in 2006, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\n (SORNA) makes it a federal crime for, inter alia, any person (1) who\n \u201cis required to register under [SORNA],\u201d and (2) who \u201ctravels in in\n terstate or foreign commerce,\u201d to (3) \u201cknowingly fai[l] to register or\n update a registration,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a). Before SORNA\u2019s enact\n ment, petitioner Carr, a registered sex offender in Alabama, relocated\n to Indiana without complying with the latter State\u2019s registration re\n quirements. Carr was indicted under \u00a72250 post-SORNA. The Fed\n eral District Court denied Carr\u2019s motion to dismiss, which asserted\n that the \u00a72250 prosecution would violate the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post\n Facto Clause because he had traveled to Indiana before SORNA\u2019s ef\n fective date. Carr then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison.\n Affirming the conviction, the Seventh Circuit held that \u00a72250 does\n not require that a defendant\u2019s travel postdate SORNA and that reli\n ance on a defendant\u2019s pre-SORNA travel poses no ex post facto prob\n lem so long as the defendant had a reasonable time to register post-\n SORNA but failed to do so, as had Carr.\nHeld: Section 2250 does not apply to sex offenders whose interstate\n travel occurred before SORNA\u2019s effective date. Pp. 5\u201318.\n    (a) The Court rejects the Government\u2019s view that \u00a72250(a) requires\n a sex-offense conviction, subsequent interstate travel, and then a\n failure to register, and that only the last of these events must occur\n after SORNA took effect. The Court instead accepts Carr\u2019s interpre\n tation that the statute does not impose liability unless a person, after\n becoming subject to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements, travels\n across state lines and then fails to register. That interpretation bet\n ter accords with \u00a72250(a)\u2019s text, the first element of which can only be\n satisfied when a person \u201cis required to register under SORNA.\u201d\n2                       CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    \u00a72250(a)(1). That \u00a72250 sets forth the travel requirement in the pre\n    sent tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) rather than in the past or present perfect\n    (\u201ctraveled\u201d or \u201chas traveled\u201d) reinforces this conclusion. See, e.g.,\n    United States v. Wilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333. And because the Dic\n    tionary Act\u2019s provision that statutory \u201cwords used in the present\n    tense include the future as well as the present,\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a71, implies\n    that the present tense generally does not include the past, regulating\n    a person who \u201ctravels\u201d is not readily understood to encompass a per\n    son whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect. Indeed,\n    there appears to be no instance in which this Court has construed a\n    present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.\n    The statutory context also supports a forward-looking construction of\n    \u201ctravels.\u201d First, the word \u201ctravels\u201d is followed in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) by a\n    series of other present tense verbs\u2014\u201centers or leaves, or resides.\u201d A\n    statute\u2019s \u201cundeviating use of the present tense\u201d is a \u201cstriking\n    indic[ator]\u201d of its \u201cprospective orientation.\u201d Gwaltney of Smithfield,\n    Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 59. Second,\n    the other elements of a \u00a72250 violation are similarly set forth in the\n    present tense: Sections 2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to\n    any person who \u201cis required to register under [SORNA]\u201d and who\n    \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a registration.\u201d (Emphasis\n    added.) Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy\n    \u00a72250\u2019s first two requirements but not the third, it presumably would\n    have varied the verb tenses, as it has in numerous other federal stat\n    utes. Pp. 5\u201311.\n        (b) The Government\u2019s two principal arguments for construing the\n    statute to cover pre-SORNA travel are unpersuasive. Pp. 11\u201318.\n           (1) The claim that such a reading avoids an \u201canomaly\u201d in the\n    statute\u2019s coverage of federal versus state sex offenders is rejected.\n    Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons\n    who fail to adhere to SORNA\u2019s registration requirements: any person\n    who is a sex offender \u201cby reason of a conviction under Federal law\n    . . . ,\u201d \u00a72250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under\n    SORNA who \u201ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce,\u201d\n    \u00a72250(a)(2)(B). The Government\u2019s assertion that \u00a72250(a)(2)\u2019s juris\n    dictional reach should have comparable breadth as applied to both\n    federal and state sex offenders is little more than ipse dixit. It is en\n    tirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Govern\n    ment a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNA\u2019s registra\n    tion requirements by federal sex offenders, who typically would have\n    spent time under federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reason\n    able for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for\n    supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and\n    to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  when, after SORNA\u2019s enactment, they use interstate commerce\n  channels to evade a State\u2019s reach. The Seventh Circuit erred in\n  analogizing \u00a72250 to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g), which prohibits convicted\n  felons from \u201cpossess[ing] in . . . commerc[e] any firearm or ammuni\n  tion.\u201d According to the lower court, \u00a72250(a), like \u00a7922(g), uses\n  movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to es\n  tablish a constitutional predicate for the statute, not to create a tem\n  poral requirement. However, the proper analogy here is not between\n  the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm, but be\n  tween the sex offender who \u201ctravels\u201d and the convicted felon who\n  \u201cpossesses.\u201d The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve\n  as a jurisdictional predicate for \u00a72250, but it is also, like the act of\n  possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim. Pp. 11\u201314.\n        (2) Also unavailing is the Government\u2019s invocation of one of\n  SORNA\u2019s purposes, to locate sex offenders who failed to abide by\n  their registration obligations. The Government\u2019s argument confuses\n  SORNA\u2019s general goal with \u00a72250\u2019s specific purpose. Section 2250 is\n  not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it\n  is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address defi\n  ciencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through\n  the cracks. By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information\n  and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these other provisions, not\n  \u00a72250, stand at the center of Congress\u2019 effort to account for missing\n  sex offenders. While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment\n  under \u00a72250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing\n  sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad\n  goal. Taking account of SORNA\u2019s overall structure, there is little\n  reason to doubt that Congress intended \u00a72250 to do exactly what it\n  says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude\n  SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by traveling in interstate com\n  merce. Pp. 14\u201317.\n        (3) None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evi\n  dence of SORNA\u2019s purpose calls this reading into question. To the\n  contrary, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Report suggests not only\n  that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with Con\n  gress\u2019 goals, but also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to\n  adopt. Pp. 17\u201318.\n     (c) Because \u00a72250 liability cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA\n  travel, the Court need not address whether the statute violates the\n  Ex Post Facto Clause.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Since 1994, federal law has required States, as a condi\ntion for the receipt of certain law enforcement funds, to\nmaintain federally compliant systems for sex-offender\nregistration and community notification. In an effort to\nmake these state schemes more comprehensive, uniform,\nand effective, Congress in 2006 enacted the Sex Offender\nRegistration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) as part\nof the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, Pub.\nL. 109\u2013248, Tit. I, 120 Stat. 590. Among its provisions,\nthe Act established a federal criminal offense covering,\ninter alia, any person who (1) \u201cis required to register\nunder [SORNA],\u201d (2) \u201ctravels in interstate or foreign com\nmerce,\u201d and (3) \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a\nregistration.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a). At issue in this case is\nwhether \u00a72250 applies to sex offenders whose interstate\ntravel occurred prior to SORNA\u2019s effective date and, if so,\nwhether the statute runs afoul of the Constitution\u2019s prohi\nbition on ex post facto laws. See Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3. Liability\nunder \u00a72250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA\ntravel. We therefore do not address the ex post facto\nquestion.\n2                 CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   In May 2004, petitioner Thomas Carr pleaded guilty in\nAlabama state court to first-degree sexual abuse. He was\nsentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but two\nyears suspended. Receiving credit for time previously\nserved, Carr was released on probation on July 3, 2004,\nand he registered as a sex offender as required by Ala\nbama law.\n   In late 2004 or early 2005, prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment,\nCarr relocated from Alabama to Indiana. He did not\ncomply with Indiana\u2019s sex-offender registration require\nments. In July 2007, Carr came to the attention of law\nenforcement in Fort Wayne, Indiana, following his in\nvolvement in a fight.\n   On August 22, 2007, federal prosecutors filed an indict\nment in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Indiana charging Carr with failing to register in\nviolation of \u00a72250. Carr moved to dismiss the indictment,\nasserting that because he traveled to Indiana prior to\nSORNA\u2019s effective date, it would violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause to prosecute him under \u00a72250. The District Court\ndenied Carr\u2019s motion, and Carr entered a conditional\nguilty plea, preserving his right to appeal. He received a\n30-month prison sentence.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit consolidated Carr\u2019s appeal with that of a similarly\nsituated defendant, who, in addition to raising an ex post\nfacto claim, asserted that \u00a72250, by its terms, does not\napply to persons whose interstate travel preceded\nSORNA\u2019s enactment. Beginning with the statutory argu\nment, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a72250 \u201cdoes not\nrequire that the defendant\u2019s travel postdate the Act.\u201d\nUnited States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008). The\ncourt relied principally on its understanding of SORNA\u2019s\nunderlying purpose:\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    \u201cThe evil at which [the Act] is aimed is that convicted\n    sex offenders registered in one state might move to\n    another state, fail to register there, and thus leave the\n    public unprotected. The concern is as acute in a case\n    in which the offender moved before the Act was\n    passed as in one in which he moved afterward.\u201d Ibid.\n    (citation omitted).\nThe court drew an analogy to 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g), which\nprohibits convicted felons from \u201cpossess[ing] in or affecting\ncommerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.\u201d \u201cThe danger\nposed by such a felon is unaffected by when the gun\ncrossed state lines . . . , and so it need not have crossed\nafter the statute was passed.\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 582 (citing\nScarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563 (1977)).\nAccording to the court, \u00a72250(a), like \u00a7922(g), uses move\nment in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element\n\u201cto establish a constitutional predicate for the statute . . .\nrather than to create a temporal requirement.\u201d 551 F. 3d,\nat 583.\n   Reading \u00a72250 to encompass pre-SORNA travel, the\nSeventh Circuit recognized, created a conflict with the\nTenth Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Husted, 545\nF. 3d 1240 (2008). In holding that \u00a72250\u2019s coverage \u201cis\nlimited to those individuals who travel in interstate com\nmerce after the Act\u2019s effective date,\u201d the Tenth Circuit\nemphasized \u201cCongress\u2019s use of the present tense form of\nthe verb \u2018to travel\u2019 . . . , which according to ordinary Eng\nlish grammar, does not refer to travel that has already\noccurred.\u201d Id., at 1243\u20131244. Rejecting this analysis, the\nSeventh Circuit characterized Congress\u2019 choice of tenses\nas \u201c \u2018not very revealing.\u2019 \u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting Scar\nborough, 431 U. S., at 571).\n   Having dispensed with the statutory question, the\nSeventh Circuit considered the claim of Carr and his co\nappellant that predicating a \u00a72250 prosecution on pre\n4                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSORNA travel violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. Reliance\non a defendant\u2019s pre-SORNA travel, the court concluded,\nposes no ex post facto problem so long as the defendant\nhad \u201creasonable time\u201d to register after SORNA took effect\nbut failed to do so. 551 F. 3d, at 585. Noting that Carr\nremained unregistered five months after SORNA became\napplicable to him, the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convic\ntion. Id., at 586\u2013587. The court reversed the conviction of\nCarr\u2019s co-appellant, finding that he had not been given a\nsufficient grace period to register.\n   In view of the division among the Circuits as to the\nmeaning of \u00a72250\u2019s \u201ctravel\u201d requirement,1 we granted\ncertiorari, 557 U. S. __ (2009), to decide the statute\u2019s\napplicability to pre-SORNA travel and, if necessary, to\nconsider the statute\u2019s compliance with the Ex Post Facto\nClause.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 While the Seventh and Tenth Circuits have confronted the question\n\ndirectly, other Circuits have also touched on it. Aligning itself with the\nSeventh Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit has analogized 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a72250(a) to the felon-in-possession statute, \u00a7922(g), and applied it to a\nsex offender who traveled before SORNA became applicable to him.\nUnited States v. Dumont, 555 F. 3d 1288, 1291\u20131292 (2009) (per cu\nriam). In contrast, the Eighth Circuit has stated in dictum that\n\u00a72250(a) \u201cpunishes convicted sex offenders who travel in interstate\ncommerce after the enactment of SORNA.\u201d United States v. May, 535\nF. 3d 912, 920 (2008) (emphasis added).\n  2 There is a separate conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to when\n\nSORNA\u2019s registration requirements became applicable to persons\nconvicted of sex offenses prior to the statute\u2019s enactment. Several\nCircuits, including the Seventh, have taken the position that the Act\ndid not apply to such sex offenders until the Attorney General provided\nfor their inclusion by issuing an interim regulation, 28 CFR \u00a772.3, 72\nFed. Reg. 8897, on February 28, 2007. See, e.g., United States v.\nHatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226\u2013229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Cain, 583\nF. 3d 408, 414\u2013419 (CA6 2009); United States v.

Because Carr traveled from\nAlabama to Indiana before both the enactment of SORNA and the\nAttorney General\u2019s regulation, we have no occasion to consider whether\na pre-SORNA sex offender whose travel and failure to register occurred\nbetween July 2006 and February 2007 is subject to liability under\n\u00a72250, and we express no view on that question. We similarly express\nno view as to whether \u00a772.3 was properly promulgated\u2014a question that\nhas also divided the Circuits.

A sequential reading, the\nparties recognize, helps to assure a nexus between a de\nfendant\u2019s interstate travel and his failure to register as a\nsex offender. Persons convicted of sex offenses under state\nlaw who fail to register in their State of conviction would\notherwise be subject to federal prosecution under \u00a72250\neven if they had not left the State after being convicted\u2014\nan illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal\ninterest in punishing such state offenders.3\n   While both parties accept that the elements of \u00a72250\nshould be read sequentially, they disagree on the event\nthat sets the sequence in motion. In the Government\u2019s\nview, the statute is triggered by a sex-offense conviction,\nwhich must be followed by interstate travel, and then a\nfailure to register under SORNA. Only the last of these\nevents, the Government maintains, must occur after\nSORNA took effect; the predicate conviction and the travel\nmay both have predated the statute\u2019s enactment. Carr, in\ncontrast, asserts that the statutory sequence begins when\na person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s registration re\nquirements. The person must then travel in interstate\ncommerce and thereafter fail to register. All of these\nevents, Carr avers, necessarily postdate SORNA\u2019s enact\nment because a sex offender could not have been required\nto register under SORNA until SORNA became the law.\n   Carr\u2019s interpretation better accords with the statutory\ntext. By its terms, the first element of \u00a72250(a) can only\nbe satisfied when a person \u201cis required to register under\nthe Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\u201d\n\u00a72250(a)(1) (emphasis added). In an attempt to reconcile\nits preferred construction with the words of the statute,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For persons convicted of sex offenses under federal or Indian tribal\n\nlaw, interstate travel is not a prerequisite to \u00a72250 liability.

To reach this\nconclusion, the Government observes that another provi\nsion of SORNA, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(a), states that the Act\u2019s\nregistration requirements apply to \u201csex offender[s].\u201d A\n\u201csex offender\u201d is elsewhere defined as \u201can individual who\nwas convicted of a sex offense.\u201d \u00a716911(1). Thus, as the\nGovernment would have it, Congress used 12 words and\ntwo implied cross-references to establish that the first\nelement of \u00a72250(a) is that a person has been convicted of\na sex offense. Such contortions can scarcely be called\n\u201cshorthand.\u201d It is far more sensible to conclude that Con\ngress meant the first precondition to \u00a72250 liability to be\nthe one it listed first: a \u201crequire[ment] to register under\n[SORNA].\u201d Once a person becomes subject to SORNA\u2019s\nregistration requirements, which can occur only after the\nstatute\u2019s effective date, that person can be convicted under\n\u00a72250 if he thereafter travels and then fails to register.4\n  That \u00a72250 sets forth the travel requirement in the\npresent tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) rather than in the past or present\nperfect (\u201ctraveled\u201d or \u201chas traveled\u201d) reinforces the conclu\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Offering  a variation on the Government\u2019s argument, the dissent\ncontends that, \u201c[i]n accordance with current drafting conventions,\n\u00a72250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law went into effect, but\nas of the time when the first act necessary for conviction is committed.\u201d\nPost, at 7 (opinion of ALITO, J.). This occurs, the dissent maintains,\n\u201cwhen an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is\nthat act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.\u201d Ibid.\nThe dissent\u2019s account cannot be squared with the statutory text. \u201c[T]he\nfirst act necessary for conviction\u201d under \u00a72250(a) is not a predicate sex\noffense conviction. It is a requirement \u201cto register under [SORNA].\u201d\n\u00a72250(a)(1). Thus, even if the dissent is correct that legislative drafters\ndo not invariably use the moment of enactment to mark the dividing\nline between covered and uncovered acts, they have clearly done so\nhere.\n8                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsion that preenactment travel falls outside the statute\u2019s\ncompass. Consistent with normal usage, we have fre\nquently looked to Congress\u2019 choice of verb tense to ascer\ntain a statute\u2019s temporal reach. See, e.g., United States v.\nWilson, 503 U. S. 329, 333 (1992) (\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb\ntense is significant in construing statutes\u201d); Gwaltney of\nSmithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484\nU. S. 49, 57 (1987) (\u201cCongress could have phrased its\nrequirement in language that looked to the past . . . , but it\ndid not choose this readily available option\u201d); Barrett v.\nUnited States, 423 U. S. 212, 216 (1976) (observing that\nCongress used the present perfect tense to \u201cdenot[e] an act\nthat has been completed\u201d). The Dictionary Act also as\ncribes significance to verb tense. It provides that, \u201c[i]n\ndetermining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless\nthe context indicates otherwise[,] . . . words used in the\npresent tense include the future as well as the present.\u201d 1\nU. S. C. \u00a71. By implication, then, the Dictionary Act in\nstructs that the present tense generally does not include\nthe past. Accordingly, a statute that regulates a person\nwho \u201ctravels\u201d is not readily understood to encompass a\nperson whose only travel occurred before the statute took\neffect. Indeed, neither the Government nor the dissent\nidentifies any instance in which this Court has construed\na present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenact\nment conduct.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 The\n        Court of Appeals quoted a Ninth Circuit decision for the propo\nsition that \u201c \u2018the present tense is commonly used to refer to past, pre\nsent, and future all at the same time.\u2019 \u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583 (quoting\nCoalition for Clean Air v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 971 F. 2d 219, 225\n(CA9 1992)). Neither court offered examples of such usage. Perhaps,\nas the Dictionary Act itself recognizes, there may be instances in which\n\u201ccontext\u201d supports this sort of omnitemporality, but it is not the typical\nunderstanding of the present tense in either normal discourse or\nstatutory construction. Taken in context, the word \u201ctravels\u201d as it\nappears in \u00a72250 is indistinguishable from the present-tense verbs that\nappear in myriad other criminal statutes to proscribe conduct on a\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In this instance, the statutory context strongly supports\na forward-looking construction of \u201ctravels.\u201d First, the\nword \u201ctravels\u201d is followed in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) by a series of\nother present tense verbs\u2014\u201centers or leaves, or resides in,\nIndian country.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This Court has previ\nously described a statute\u2019s \u201cundeviating use of the present\ntense\u201d as a \u201cstriking indic[ator]\u201d of its \u201cprospective orien\ntation.\u201d Gwaltney, 484 U. S., at 59. The Seventh Circuit\nthought otherwise, reasoning that it would \u201cmak[e] no\nsense\u201d for \u201ca sex offender who has resided in Indian coun\ntry since long before the Act was passed [to be] subject to\nthe Act but not someone who crossed state lines before the\nAct was passed.\u201d 551 F. 3d, at 583. As a textual matter,\nhowever, it is the Seventh Circuit\u2019s approach that makes\nlittle sense: If \u201ctravels\u201d means \u201ctraveled\u201d (i.e., a person\n\u201ctravels\u201d if he crossed state lines before SORNA\u2019s enact\nment), then the only way to avoid an incongruity among\nneighboring verbs would be to construe the phrase \u201cre\nsides i[n] Indian country\u201d to encompass persons who once\nresided in Indian country but who left before SORNA\u2019s\nenactment and have not since returned\u2014an implausible\nreading that neither the Seventh Circuit, nor the Govern\nment, nor the dissent endorses.\n   Second, the other elements of a \u00a72250 violation are\nsimilarly set forth in the present tense.            Sections\n2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who\n\u201cis required to register under [SORNA]\u201d and who \u201cknow\ningly fails to register or update a registration as required\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprospective basis. Examining a criminal law with a travel element\nsimilar to the one at issue here, the Ninth Circuit itself recently agreed\nthat \u201cthe present tense verb \u2018travels,\u2019 most sensibly read, does not refer\nto travel that occurred in the past\u2014that is, before the enactment of the\nstatute.\u201d United States v. Jackson, 480 F. 3d 1014, 1019 (CA9 2007)\n(interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a72423(c), which imposes criminal penalties on\n\u201c[a]ny United States citizen . . . who travels in foreign commerce, and\nengages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person\u201d).\n10                    CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nby [SORNA].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Government ac\ncepts that this last element\u2014a knowing failure to register\nor update a registration\u2014must postdate SORNA\u2019s enact\nment. Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to\nsatisfy the first two requirements of \u00a72250 but not the\nthird, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses to\nconvey this meaning. Indeed, numerous federal statutes\nuse the past-perfect tense to describe one or more ele\nments of a criminal offense when coverage of preenact\nment events is intended.         See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. A.\n\u00a7249(a)(2)(B)(iii) (Supp. 2010) (proscribing hate crimes in\nwhich \u201cthe defendant employs a firearm, dangerous\nweapon, explosive or incendiary device, or other weapon\nthat has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce\u201d (em\nphasis added)); 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g)(9) (2006 ed.) (proscrib\ning firearm possession or transport by any person \u201cwho\nhas been convicted\u201d of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence (emphasis added)); \u00a72252(a)(2) (2006\ned., Supp. II) (making it unlawful for any person to receive\nor distribute a visual depiction of a minor engaging in\nsexually explicit conduct that \u201chas been mailed, or has\nbeen shipped or transported in or affecting interstate or\nforeign commerce\u201d (emphasis added)). The absence of\nsimilar phrasing here provides powerful evidence that\n\u00a72250 targets only postenactment travel.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent identifies several \u201cSORNA provisions that plainly use\n\nthe present tense to refer to events that . . . may have occurred before\nSORNA took effect.\u201d Post, at 10. All of these examples appear in 42\nU. S. C. \u00a716911, a definitional section that merely elucidates the\nmeaning of certain statutory terms and proscribes no conduct. All but\ntwo of the provisions, moreover, rely on the term \u201csex offender,\u201d which\n\u00a716911(1) defines to mean \u201can individual who was convicted of a sex\noffense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The remaining provisions are \u00a716911(7),\nwhich simply uses \u201cinvolves\u201d rather than \u201cinvolved\u201d to define whether a\nprior conviction qualifies as a \u201cspecified offense against a minor,\u201d and\n\u00a716911(8), which makes plain that its present-tense reference to an\noffender\u2019s age refers to age \u201cat the time of the offense.\u201d These examples\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

According to the Government, these cate\ngories correspond to \u201ctwo alternate sources of power to\nachieve Congress\u2019s aim of broadly registering sex offend\ners.\u201d Id., at 22. Placing pre-SORNA travelers within the\nstatute\u2019s coverage, the Government maintains, \u201censures\nthat the jurisdictional reach of Section 2250(a)(2) has a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthus provide scant support for the proposition that \u00a72250 uses \u201ctravels\u201d\nto refer to pre-SORNA travel. Given the well-established presumption\nagainst retroactivity and, in the criminal context, the constitutional bar\non ex post facto laws, it cannot be the case that a statutory prohibition\nset forth in the present tense applies by default to acts completed before\nthe statute\u2019s enactment. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U. S. 694,\n701 (2000) (\u201cAbsent a clear statement of that intent, we do not give\nretroactive effect to statutes burdening private interests\u201d).\n12                 CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncomparable breadth as applied to both federal and state\nsex offenders.\u201d Id., at 21.\n   The Government\u2019s pronouncement that \u00a72250 should\nhave an \u201cequally broad sweep\u201d with respect to federal and\nstate offenders, id., at 22, is little more than ipse dixit.\nHad Congress intended to subject any unregistered state\nsex offender who has ever traveled in interstate commerce\nto federal prosecution under \u00a72250, it easily could have\nadopted language to that effect. That it declined to do so\nindicates that Congress instead chose to handle federal\nand state sex offenders differently. There is nothing\n\u201canomal[ous]\u201d about such a choice. To the contrary, it is\nentirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the\nFederal Government a special role in ensuring compliance\nwith SORNA\u2019s registration requirements by federal sex\noffenders\u2014persons who typically would have spent time\nunder federal criminal supervision. It is similarly reason\nable for Congress to have given the States primary re\nsponsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance\namong state sex offenders and to have subjected such\noffenders to federal criminal liability only when, after\nSORNA\u2019s enactment, they use the channels of interstate\ncommerce in evading a State\u2019s reach.\n   In this regard, it is notable that the federal sex-offender\nregistration laws have, from their inception, expressly\nrelied on state-level enforcement. Indeed, when it initially\nset national standards for state sex-offender registration\nprograms in 1994, Congress did not include any federal\ncriminal liability. Congress instead conditioned certain\nfederal funds on States\u2019 adoption of \u201ccriminal penalties\u201d on\nany person \u201crequired to register under a State program . . .\nwho knowingly fails to so register and keep such registra\ntion current.\u201d Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children\nand Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Pub.

No statutory gap necessitated\ncoverage of unregistered offenders who \u201cchange[d] ad\ndress\u201d before the statute\u2019s enactment; the prosecution of\nsuch persons remained the province of the States.\n   In enacting SORNA, Congress preserved this basic\nallocation of enforcement responsibilities. To strengthen\nstate enforcement of registration requirements, Congress\nestablished, as a funding condition, that \u201c[e]ach jurisdic\ntion, other than a Federally recognized Indian tribe, shall\nprovide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term\nof imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure\nof a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this\nsubchapter.\u201d \u00a716913(e).8 Meanwhile, Congress in \u00a72250\nexposed to federal criminal liability, with penalties of up\nto 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, persons required to register\nunder SORNA over whom the Federal Government has a\ndirect supervisory interest or who threaten the efficacy of\nthe statutory scheme by traveling in interstate commerce.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Pre-SORNA    law also exposed to federal criminal liability any person\nwhose State \u201cha[d] not established a minimally sufficient sexual\noffender registration program\u201d and who was thus required to register\nwith the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a714072(c), (g)(2), (i).

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Understanding the act of travel as an aspect of the harm\nCongress sought to punish serves to distinguish \u00a72250\nfrom the felon-in-possession statute to which the Seventh\nCircuit analogized. See 551 F. 3d, at 582\u2013583. In Scar\nborough, this Court held that a prior version of the stat\nute, which imposed criminal liability on any convicted\nfelon who \u201c \u2018possesses . . . in commerce or affecting com\nmerce . . . any firearm,\u2019 \u201d 431 U. S., at 564 (quoting 18\nU. S. C. App. \u00a71202(a) (1970 ed.)), did not require the\nGovernment to prove postenactment movement of the\nfirearm across state lines. According to the Court, Con\ngress had given \u201cno indication of any concern with either\nthe movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time\nof acquisition.\u201d 431 U. S., at 572. Its aim was simply \u201cto\nkeep guns out of the hands of\u201d convicted felons, ibid., and,\nby using the phrase \u201cin commerce or affecting commerce,\u201d\nit invoked the full breadth of its Commerce Clause author\nity to achieve that end. No one in Scarborough disputed,\nhowever, that the act of possession had to occur post\nenactment; a felon who \u201cpossess[ed]\u201d a firearm only pre\nenactment was plainly outside the statute\u2019s sweep. In this\ncase, the proper analogy is not, as the Seventh Circuit\nsuggested, between the travel of a sex offender and the\nmovement of a firearm; it is between the sex offender who\n\u201ctravels\u201d and the convicted felon who \u201cpossesses.\u201d The act\nof travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a juris\ndictional predicate for \u00a72250, but it is also, like the act of\npossession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.\n                              B\n  In a final effort to justify its position, the Government\ninvokes one of SORNA\u2019s underlying purposes: to locate sex\noffenders who had failed to abide by their registration\nobligations.   SORNA, the Government observes, was\nmotivated at least in part by Congress\u2019 concern about\nthese \u201cmissing\u201d sex offenders\u2014a problem the House\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCommittee on the Judiciary expressly linked to interstate\ntravel: \u201cThe most significant enforcement issue in the sex\noffender program is that over 100,000 sex offenders, or\nnearly one-fifth in the Nation[,] are \u2018missing,\u2019 meaning\nthey have not complied with sex offender registration\nrequirements. This typically occurs when the sex offender\nmoves from one State to another.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013\n218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The goal of tracking down missing\nsex offenders, the Government maintains, \u201cis surely better\nserved by making Section 2250 applicable to them in their\nnew States of residence immediately than by waiting for\nthem to travel in interstate commerce and fail to register\nyet again.\u201d Brief for United States 23\u201324. The Court of\nAppeals expressed a similar view. See 551 F. 3d, at 582.9\n   The Government\u2019s argument confuses a general goal of\nSORNA with the specific purpose of \u00a72250. Section 2250\nis not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Also making this point, the dissent maintains that \u201c[i]nterpreting\n\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment travel severely impairs\n\u00a72250(a)\u2019s effectiveness\u201d by \u201cplac[ing] beyond the reach of the federal\ncriminal laws\u201d \u201cthe many sex offenders who had managed to avoid pre\nexisting registration regimes.\u201d Post, at 14. The dissent sees \u201cno appar\nent reason why Congress would have wanted to impose such a require\nment.\u201d Ibid. Yet the dissent approves an even greater impairment.\nAddressing a dispute we leave unresolved, see n. 2, supra, the dissent\nwould hold that, in enacting SORNA, \u201cCongress remained neutral on\nthe question whether the Act reaches those with pre-SORNA sex\noffense convictions.\u201d Post, at 10. The dissent\u2019s view, in other words, is\nthat SORNA does not apply of its own force to any sex offenders con\nvicted prior to the statute\u2019s enactment\u2014a reading wholly inconsistent\nwith the dissent\u2019s description of SORNA as \u201ca response to a dangerous\ngap in the then-existing sex-offender-registration laws.\u201d Post, at 13. If,\nas the dissent accepts, Congress left open the possibility that no preen\nactment offenders would face liability under \u00a72250, then it is certainly\nnot unreasonable to conclude that Congress limited the statute\u2019s\ncoverage to offenders who travel after its enactment. Indeed, it is\nstrange to think that Congress might have enacted a statute that\ndeclined to cover pre-SORNA offenders but nevertheless covered pre-\nSORNA travel.\n16                CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme\nenacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that had\nenabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks. See 42\nU. S. C. \u00a716901 (\u201cCongress in this chapter establishes a\ncomprehensive national system for the registration of [sex]\noffenders\u201d). Among its many provisions, SORNA instructs\nStates to maintain sex-offender registries that compile an\narray of information about sex offenders, \u00a716914; to make\nthis information publicly available online, \u00a716918; to share\nthe information with other jurisdictions and with the\nAttorney General for inclusion in a comprehensive na\ntional sex-offender registry, \u00a7\u00a716919\u201316921; and to \u201cpro\nvide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of\nimprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure of\na sex offender to comply with the requirements of this\nsubchapter,\u201d \u00a716913(e). Sex offenders, in turn, are re\nquired to \u201cregister, and keep the registration current, in\neach jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the\noffender is an employee, and where the offender is a stu\ndent,\u201d \u00a716913(a), and to appear in person periodically to\n\u201callow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph, and\nverify the information in each registry in which that of\nfender is required to be registered,\u201d \u00a716916. By facilitat\ning the collection of sex-offender information and its dis\nsemination among jurisdictions, these provisions, not\n\u00a72250, stand at the center of Congress\u2019 effort to account for\nmissing sex offenders.\n   Knowing that Congress aimed to reduce the number of\nnoncompliant sex offenders thus tells us little about the\nspecific policy choice Congress made in enacting \u00a72250.\nWhile subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment\nunder \u00a72250 may well be consistent with the aim of find\ning missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no\nway frustrates that broad goal.         Taking account of\nSORNA\u2019s overall structure, we have little reason to doubt\nthat Congress intended \u00a72250 to do exactly what it says:\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Cf. Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508\nU. S. 248, 261 (1993) (\u201c[V]ague notions of a statute\u2019s \u2018basic\npurpose\u2019 are . . . inadequate to overcome the words of its\ntext regarding the specific issue under consideration\u201d).\n                                C\n   None of the legislative materials the Government cites\nas evidence of SORNA\u2019s purpose calls this reading into\nquestion. To the contrary, the report of the House Judici\nary Committee suggests not only that a prohibition on\npostenactment travel is consonant with Congress\u2019 goals,\nbut also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to adopt.\nAs the Government acknowledges, the bill under consid\neration by the Committee contained a version of \u00a72250\nthat \u201cwould not have reached pre-enactment interstate\ntravel.\u201d Brief for United States 24, n. 9. This earlier\nversion imposed federal criminal penalties on any person\nwho \u201creceives a notice from an official that such person is\nrequired to register under [SORNA] and . . . thereafter\ntravels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or\nleaves Indian country.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013218, pt. 1, at\n9; see also id., at 26 (\u201c[S]ex offenders will now face Federal\nprosecution . . . if they cross a State line and fail to comply\nwith the sex offender registration and notification re\nquirements contained in the legislation\u201d). Yet this did not\nstop the Committee from describing its legislation as a\nsolution to the problem of missing sex offenders. See id.,\nat 23\u201324, 26, 45\u201346. The Government identifies nothing\nin the legislative record to suggest that, in modifying this\nlanguage during the course of the legislative process,\nCongress intended to alter the statute\u2019s temporal sweep.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Among other changes, Congress eliminated the language that con\n\nditioned liability on proof of notice, and it removed the word \u201cthereaf\nter,\u201d presumably as redundant in light of the sequential structure of the\n18                 CARR v.

S. C. \u00a72250(a), a provision of the Sex Offender Registra\ntion and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) that is designed\nto prevent dangerous sex offenders from evading registra\ntion requirements. SORNA requires convicted sex offend\ners to register, and to keep their registrations current, in\neach jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a716913, and the provision at issue here, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a72250(a), makes it a crime for a convicted sex\noffender who moves in interstate commerce1 to fail to\nabide by the Act\u2019s registration requirements. The question\nthat we must decide is whether \u00a72250(a) applies only to\nthose sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce\nafter SORNA became law or whether the statute also\nreaches sex offenders, like petitioner, who were convicted2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Section 2250(a) also applies to persons with federal sex-offense con\n\nvictions, those who travel in foreign commerce, and those who enter,\nleave, or reside in Indian country. For convenience, I will refer in this\nopinion solely to interstate travel.\n  2 The Court holds only that \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) does not apply to a person\n\nwho moved in interstate commerce before SORNA took effect. The\nCourt does not address the separate question whether \u00a72250(a) may\nvalidly be applied to a person who was convicted of a qualifying offense\nbefore SORNA was enacted. Congress delegated to the Attorney\nGeneral the authority to decide whether the Act\u2019s registration require\n2                    CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand traveled before SORNA took effect but violated the\nregistration requirement after that date.\n   The Court\u2019s answer is that \u00a72250(a) applies only to sex\noffenders who moved from State to State after SORNA\nbecame law. The Court reaches this conclusion for two\nreasons: (1) the verb tense used in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B); and (2)\nthe sequence in which the elements of the offense are\nlisted.\n   As I will attempt to show, the Court\u2019s textual arguments\nare thoroughly unsound. And the conclusion that the\nCourt reaches makes no sense. To appreciate the folly of\nthe Court\u2019s interpretation, consider the following two\ncases.\n   The first involves a situation in which, for present pur\nposes, I assume that \u00a72250(a) applies.3 A man convicted\nin State A for sexual abuse is released from custody in\nthat State and then, after the enactment of SORNA,\nmoves to State B and fails to register as required by State\nB law. Section 2250(a) makes this offender\u2019s failure to\nregister in State B a federal crime because his interstate\nmovement frustrates SORNA\u2019s registration requirements.\nBecause this offender is convicted and then released from\ncustody in State A, the State A authorities know of his\npresence in their State and are thus in a position to try to\nensure that he remains registered. At the time of his\nrelease, they can ascertain where he intends to live, and\nthey can make sure that he registers as required by state\nlaw. Thereafter, they can periodically check the address\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nments\u2014and thus \u00a72250(a)\u2019s criminal penalties\u2014should apply to per\nsons in the latter category, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(d), and the Attorney\nGeneral has promulgated a regulation providing that they do, 72 Fed.\nReg. 8897 (2007) (codified at 28 CFR \u00a772.3 (2009)). Because the Court\ndoes not address the validity of this regulation, I proceed on the as\nsumption that 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA\nsex-offense convictions.\n  3 See n. 2, supra.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nat which he is registered to confirm that he still resides\nthere. And even if he moves without warning to some\nother address in the State, they can try to track him down.\nOnce this offender leaves State A, however, the authorities\nin that State are severely limited in their ability to moni\ntor his movements. And because the State B authorities\nhave no notice of his entry into their State, they are at a\ngreat disadvantage in trying to enforce State B\u2019s registra\ntion law. Congress enacted \u00a72250(a) in order to punish\nand deter interstate movement that seriously undermines\nthe enforcement of sex-offender-registration laws.\n   The second case is the same as the first in all respects\nexcept that the sex offender travels from State A to State\nB before SORNA\u2019s enactment. In other words, the sex\noffender is convicted and later released in State A; prior to\nSORNA\u2019s enactment, he moves to State B; and then, after\nSORNA takes effects, he fails to register in State B, as\nSORNA requires.\n   Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to\ntreat the second case any differently from the first? In\nboth cases, a sex offender\u2019s interstate movement frustrates\nenforcement of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements. In\nboth cases, as a result of that interstate travel, the sex\noffender\u2019s new neighbors in State B are unaware of the\npresence of a potentially dangerous person in their com\nmunity, and the State B law enforcement authorities are\nhampered in their ability to protect the public. The second\ncase is the case now before the Court, and the Court offers\nno plausible explanation why Congress might have\nwanted to treat this case any differently from the first.\n   If the text of \u00a72250(a) commanded this result, we would,\nof course, be obligated to heed that command. But the text\nof \u00a72250(a) dictates no such thing. On the contrary, when\nproperly read, it reaches both cases.\n   Section 2250(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:\n4                  CARR v.

And\npetitioner\u2019s argument fails because it begs the relevant\nquestion. Petitioner belabors the obvious\u2014that the pre\nsent tense is not used to refer to events that occurred in\nthe past\u2014but studiously avoids the critical question: At\nwhat point in time does \u00a72250(a) speak? Does it speak as\nof the time when SORNA took effect? Or does it speak as\nof the time when the proscribed conduct occurs? Without\nknowing the point in time at which the law speaks, it is\nimpossible to tell what is past and what is present or\nfuture.\n  The unspoken premise of petitioner\u2019s argument is that\n\u00a72250(a) speaks as of the time when it became law. And if\nthat premise is accepted, it follows that the use of the\npresent tense in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) means that the requisite\ninterstate travel must occur after, not before, SORNA took\neffect. Petitioner\u2019s premise, however, flies in the face of\nthe widely accepted modern legislative drafting convention\nthat a law should not be read to speak as of the date of\nenactment. The United States Senate Legislative Draft\ning Manual directly addresses this point: \u201cA legislative\nprovision speaks as of any date on which it is read (rather\nthan as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).\u201d\nSenate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Draft\ning Manual \u00a7103(a), p. 4 (1997) (emphasis added). The\nHouse Manual makes the same point:\n    \u201cYour draft should be a movable feast\u2014that is, it\n    speaks as of whatever time it is being read (rather\n    than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect).\u201d\n    House Legislative Counsel\u2019s Manual on Drafting\n    Style, HLC No. 104\u20131, \u00a7102(c), p. 2 (1995).\n  In accordance with this convention, modern legislative\ndrafting manuals teach that, except in unusual circum\nstances, all laws, including penal statutes, should be\n6                 CARR v.

The Senate Manual, supra,\n\u00a7103(a), at 4, states: \u201c[A]lways use the present tense\nunless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or\na sequence of events that requires use of a different tense.\u201d\nSimilarly, the House Manual, supra, \u00a7102(c), at 2, advises:\n\u201cSTAY IN THE PRESENT.\u2013\u2013 Whenever possible, use the\npresent tense (rather than the past or future).\u201d Numerous\nstate legislative drafting manuals and other similar hand\nbooks hammer home this same point.

The majority of rules have a continuing effect\nin that they apply over time. They speak at the time of\nreading, not merely at the time of their adoption. The\npresent tense therefore includes the future tense\u201d).\n   Once it is recognized that \u00a72250(a) should not be read as\nspeaking as of the date when SORNA went into effect,\npetitioner\u2019s argument about the use of the present tense\ncollapses. In accordance with current drafting conven\ntions, \u00a72250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law\nwent into effect, but as of the time when the first act\nnecessary for conviction is committed. In the case of\n\u00a72250(a), that occurs when an individual is convicted of a\nqualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the\nrequirement to register under SORNA.4 For present\npurposes, we must proceed on the assumption that this\nevent may have occurred before SORNA was enacted.\nViewed as of the time when such a pre-SORNA conviction\ntakes place, every subsequent act, including movement\nfrom State to State, occurs in the future and is thus prop\nerly described using the present tense. Accordingly,\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B)\u2019s use of the present tense (\u201ctravels\u201d) sup\nports the application of the statute to a sex offender, like\npetitioner, who moved from State to State after conviction\nbut before SORNA went into effect.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Under  42 U. S. C. \u00a716913, a \u201csex offender\u201d is required to register,\nand the term \u201csex offender\u201d is defined as a person who was convicted of\na \u201csex offense.\u201d \u00a716911(1). The Court relies on the artificial argument\nthat the first act necessary for conviction under 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) is\nthe failure to register, ante, at 6\u20137, and n. 4, but in real-world terms the\nfirst necessary act is plainly the commission of a qualifying offense.\n   5 Contrary to the Court\u2019s interpretation, see ante, at 8\u20139, Gwaltney of\n\nSmithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49\n(1987), does not support petitioner\u2019s argument. Gwaltney involved a\ncivil action brought under \u00a7505 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71365(a), which authorizes suit against any person \u201calleged to be in\n8                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              C\n\n  Petitioner\u2019s present-tense argument is particularly\nperverse in light of the context in which \u00a72250(a) was\nadopted. When SORNA was enacted, Congress elected not\nto decide for itself whether the Act\u2019s registration require\nments\u2014and thus \u00a72250(a)\u2019s criminal penalties\u2014would\napply to persons who had been convicted of qualifying sex\noffenses before SORNA took effect. Instead, Congress\ndelegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide\nthat question. See \u00a7113(d), 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a716913(d) (\u201cThe Attorney General shall have the authority\nto specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I\nof SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enact\nment of this Act\u201d).6 Pursuant to this delegation, the At\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nviolation\u201d of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\npermit. In Gwaltney, the permit holder had violated its permit between\n1981 and 1984, but the permit holder claimed that it had ceased all\nviolations by the time the suit was filed. 484 U. S., at 53\u201355. This\nCourt held that the phrase \u201calleged to be in violation\u201d showed that the\nprovision was meant to apply only where an ongoing violation is al\nleged. Id., at 59.\n  The provision at issue in Gwaltney differs from \u00a72250(a) in that it\nspecifies the relevant temporal point of reference, namely, the point in\ntime when the allegation of an ongoing violation is made. Section\n2250(a) contains no similar specification. Moreover, the Gwaltney\nCourt did not read the provision at issue there as speaking at the time\nwhen the provision was enacted. As noted above, however, the silent\npremise of petitioner\u2019s argument is that \u00a72250(a) must be read as\nspeaking as of the time of SORNA\u2019s enactment.\n  6 To be sure, at least two Courts of Appeals have held that SORNA\u2019s\n\nregistration requirements apply by the Act\u2019s own terms to those indi\nviduals with sex-offense convictions that predate SORNA\u2019s enactment.\nSee United States v. Hinckley, 550 F. 3d 926, 929\u2013935 (CA10 2008);\nUnited States v. May, 535 F. 3d 912, 918\u2013919 (CA8 2008). Other\nCourts of Appeals, however, have disagreed, reasoning that SORNA\u2019s\nexplicit grant of authority to the Attorney General to determine the\nAct\u2019s applicability to offenders with pre-SORNA convictions implies\nthat the Act would not apply to those sex offenders absent the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s regulation. See, e.g., United States v. Cain, 583 F. 3d 408,\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ntorney General in 2007 issued an interim rule providing\nthat SORNA applies to pre-enactment convictions. 72\nFed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \u00a772.3).7\n   Petitioner contends that, if Congress had wanted to\nmake \u00a72250(a) applicable to sex offenders who traveled in\ninterstate commerce before SORNA took effect, Congress\ncould have referred in \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to a person who\n\u201ctraveled,\u201d \u201chas traveled,\u201d or, at the time of the statute\u2019s\nenactment, \u201chad traveled\u201d in interstate commerce. Brief\nfor Petitioner 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Any\nsuch phrasing, however, would have strongly suggested\nthat \u00a72250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex\noffense convictions\u2014the very question that Congress chose\nnot to decide but instead to leave for the Attorney General.\n   A brief explanation is needed to make clear why word\ning \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) in the past tense (or the present perfect\nor past perfect tense) would have had such an effect. The\nCourt and I agree that \u00a72250(a) applies only to persons\nwho travel in interstate commerce after they are convicted\nof a qualifying sex offense. See ante, at 6; infra, at 11\u201312.\nTherefore, if \u00a72250(a) had been phrased in the past tense\n(or the present perfect or past perfect tense), it would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n414\u2013415, 419 (CA6 2009); United States v. Hatcher, 560 F. 3d 222, 226\u2013\n229 (CA4 2009); United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 585 (CA7 2008)\n(case below); United States v. Madera, 528 F. 3d 852, 856\u2013859 (CA11\n2008). Those Courts of Appeals in the latter group, in my view, have\nthe better of the argument. Section 113(d) of SORNA delegates to the\nAttorney General the \u201cauthority to specify the applicability of the\nrequirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the\nenactment of [the] Act.\u201d 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(d). The clear\nnegative implication of that delegation is that, without such a determi\nnation by the Attorney General, the Act would not apply to those with\npre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.\n  7 Although not controlling, it is worth noting that one of the two ex\n\namples the Attorney General included in his February 2007 rule\ncontemplated that pre-SORNA travel would be sufficient to satisfy\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B)\u2019s interstate-travel requirement. See 28 CFR \u00a772.3\n(Example 2).\n10                   CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nseem necessarily to follow that the provision reaches pre-\nSORNA convictions. By using the present tense, Congress\nremained neutral on the question whether the Act reaches\nthose with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions and left\nthat question open for the Attorney General.\n   The conclusion that \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) embraces pre-\nSORNA travel is reinforced by the presence of quite a few\nother SORNA provisions that plainly use the present\ntense to refer to events that, as a result of the Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s regulation, may have occurred before SORNA\ntook effect. For example, an individual may qualify as a\n\u201ctier II sex offender\u201d under the Act if, among other things,\nhis sex offense \u201cinvolves . . . (i) use of a minor in sexual\nperformance; (ii) solicitation of a minor to practice prosti\ntution; or (iii) production or distribution of child pornogra\nphy.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a716911(3)(B) (emphasis added); see also\n\u00a716911(4)(B) (offense \u201cinvolves kidnapping a minor\u201d (em\nphasis added)); \u00a716911(7) (offense \u201cinvolves\u201d certain speci\nfied conduct). Similarly, a sex offender can qualify as a\n\u201ctier II sex offender\u201d if his sex offense \u201coccurs after the\noffender becomes a tier I sex offender.\u201d \u00a716911(3)(C) (em\nphasis added); see also \u00a716911(4)(C) (offense \u201coccurs after\nthe offender becomes a tier II sex offender\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). A juvenile adjudication, moreover, may qualify as\na conviction for purposes of the Act only if, among other\nthings, the \u201coffender is 14 years of age or older at the time\nof the offense.\u201d \u00a716911(8) (emphasis added).8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 That many of these provisions rely on \u00a716911(1)\u2019s definition of the\n\nterm \u201csex offender\u201d changes nothing. See ante, at 10, n. 6. Had the\nAttorney General not exercised his discretion to make SORNA\u2019s regis\ntration requirements applicable to those with pre-SORNA sex-offense\nconvictions, all of these provisions would have applied to only pos\ntenactment conduct\u2014notwithstanding \u00a716911(1)\u2019s reference to \u201can\nindividual who was convicted of a sex offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But\nnow that the Attorney General has so exercised his discretion, all of\nthese present-tense-phrased provisions necessarily must be interpreted\nas reaching pre-enactment conduct. The same conclusion should follow\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  11\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress cast all of these provisions in the present\ntense, but now that the Attorney General has made\nSORNA applicable to individuals with pre-SORNA sex\noffense convictions, all of these provisions must necessar\nily be interpreted as embracing pre-enactment conduct.\n                               II\n   The Court\u2019s second reason for holding that 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a72250(a) reaches only post-SORNA travel is based on the\nsequence in which the elements of \u00a72250(a) are listed. The\nCourt concludes (and I agree) that the first listed element\n(subsection (a)(1) (\u201cis required to register under the Sex\nOffender Registration and Notification Act\u201d)) cannot have\nbeen violated until the Act took effect. The Court then\nreasons that the third listed element (subsection (a)(2)(B)\n(\u201ctravels in interstate . . . commerce\u201d)) must be violated\nafter the first. See ante, at 6. The Court explains: \u201cPer\nsons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to\nregister in their State of conviction would otherwise be\nsubject to federal prosecution under \u00a72250 even if they\nhad not left the State after being convicted\u2014an illogical\nresult given the absence of any obvious federal interest in\npunishing such state offenders.\u201d Ibid. In other words, the\nCourt reasons that it would be illogical to interpret the\nstatute as reaching a person who first moves from State A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith respect to 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a)(2)(B).\n  Additionally, I do not suggest that the \u201cdefault\u201d rule is that provi\nsions written in the present tense apply to past conduct. To the con\ntrary, I had thought it an uncontroversial proposition of statutory\ninterpretation that statutes must be interpreted in context. See, e.g.,\nUnited States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America,\nInc., 508 U. S. 439, 455 (1993); see also 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 1. And when\n\u00a72250(a) is read with an eye to the context in which SORNA was\nenacted, it becomes quite clear that \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) should be inter\npreted as reaching pre-enactment travel. Giving effect to those contex\ntual indicators, moreover, does not offend the presumption against\nretroactivity or the Ex Post Facto Clause. See n. 10, infra.\n12                CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nto State B, then commits and is convicted of a qualifying\nsex offense in State B, and subsequently, upon release\nfrom custody in State B, fails to register as required under\nthe law of that State.\n   I agree with the Court that there is a good argument\nthat \u00a72250(a) should not be read to apply to such a case,\nwhere there is little if any connection between the of\nfender\u2019s prior interstate movement and his subsequent\nfailure to register. In the two hypothetical cases discussed\nat the beginning of this opinion, the offender\u2019s interstate\nmovement seriously frustrated the ability of the law en\nforcement authorities in his new State (State B) to enforce\nits registration requirements. By contrast, where an\noffender\u2019s interstate movement predates his sex offense\nand conviction, his interstate movement has little if any\neffect on the ability of the law enforcement authorities in\nState B to enforce that State\u2019s laws. When a sex offender\nis released from custody in State B, the ability of the State\nB authorities to enforce that State\u2019s registration laws\nwould appear to be the same regardless of whether that\noffender had lived his entire life in that State or had\nmoved to the State prior to committing the offense for\nwhich he was convicted. Accordingly, it can be argued\nthat Congress cannot have meant to reach this situation.\nAs the Seventh Circuit put it, \u201c[s]ince the statutory aim is\nto prevent a convicted sex offender from circumventing\nregistration by leaving the state in which he is registered,\nit can be argued that the travel must postdate the convic\ntion.\u201d United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d 578, 582 (2008).\nIt can also be argued that a broader construction would\nmean that Congress exceeded its authority under the\nCommerce Clause. See Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 16\u201317.\n   What the Court\u2019s argument shows, however, is not that\nthe interstate travel required by \u00a72250(a) must come after\nSORNA\u2019s enactment. Rather, what the Court\u2019s argument\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsuggests is that the interstate travel must come after the\nsex-offense conviction. And because, under the regulation\npromulgated by the Attorney General, \u00a72250(a) reaches\npre-SORNA convictions, this argument does not support\nthe Court\u2019s conclusion that the interstate travel needed\nunder \u00a72250(a) must have occurred after SORNA was\nenacted.\n                             III\n   When an interpretation of a statutory text leads to a\nresult that makes no sense, a court should at a minimum\ngo back and verify that the textual analysis is correct.\nHere, not only are the Court\u2019s textual arguments unsound\nfor the reasons explained above, but the indefensible\nresults produced by the Court\u2019s interpretation should have\nled the Court to doublecheck its textual analysis.\n   SORNA was a response to a dangerous gap in the then\nexisting sex-offender-registration laws. In the years prior\nto SORNA\u2019s enactment, the Nation had been shocked by\ncases in which children had been raped and murdered by\npersons who, unbeknownst to their neighbors or the police,\nwere convicted sex offenders. In response, Congress and\nstate legislatures passed laws requiring the registration of\nsex offenders. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 89\u201390\n(2003); Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and\nSexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Tit. 17, 108\nStat. 2038; Megan\u2019s Law, 110 Stat. 1345. Despite those\nefforts, by 2006 an estimated 100,000 convicted sex of\nfenders\u2014nearly one-fifth of the Nation\u2019s total sex-offender\npopulation\u2014remained unregistered. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013\n218, pt. 1, p. 26 (2005). The principal problem, a House\nReport determined, was that sex offenders commonly\nmoved from one State to another and then failed to regis\nter in their new State of residence. Ibid. In other words,\ninterstate travel was dangerously undermining the effec\ntiveness of state sex-offender-registration laws.\n14                     CARR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Interpreting \u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment\ntravel severely impairs \u00a72250(a)\u2019s effectiveness. As inter\npreted by the Court, \u00a72250(a) applies to a pre-SORNA sex\noffender only if that offender traveled in interstate com\nmerce at some point after SORNA\u2019s enactment. As the\nexamples discussed at the beginning of this opinion illus\ntrate, however, there is no apparent reason why Congress\nwould have wanted to impose such a requirement. To the\ncontrary, under the Court\u2019s interpretation, the many sex\noffenders who had managed to avoid pre-existing registra\ntion regimes, mainly by moving from one State to another\nbefore SORNA\u2019s enactment, are placed beyond the reach of\nthe federal criminal laws. It surely better serves the\nenforcement of SORNA\u2019s registration requirements to\napply \u00a72250(a) to all pre-SORNA sex offenders, regardless\nof whether their interstate travel occurred before or after\nthe statute\u2019s enactment.\n   The Court provides only a weak defense of the result its\nanalysis produces. The Court suggests that enhanced\ninformation collection and sharing and state enforcement\nof registration laws were the sole weapons that Congress\nchose to wield in order to deal with those convicted sex\noffenders whose whereabouts were unknown when\nSORNA was passed. See ante, at 14\u201316. I see no basis for\nthis conclusion. There can be no dispute that the enact\nment of \u00a72250(a) shows that Congress did not think these\nmeasures were sufficient to deal with persons who have\nqualifying sex-offense convictions and who move from\nState to State after SORNA\u2019s enactment. And in light of\nthat congressional judgment, is there any plausible reason\nto think that Congress concluded that these same meas\nures would be adequate for those with qualifying sex\noffense convictions who had already disappeared at the\ntime of SORNA\u2019s enactment?9 The Court has no answer,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 9 Contrary   to the Court\u2019s suggestion, see ante, at 15, n. 9, it is no an\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    15\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nand I submit that there is none.10\n                            IV\n  For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the\nSeventh Circuit, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nswer to point to Congress\u2019 decision to delegate to the Attorney General\nthe responsibility of deciding whether \u00a72250(a) should reach persons\nwith pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions. Of course, that delegation\ncreated the possibility that the Attorney General would decide that\n\u00a72250(a) should not apply to such offenders, and if he had so decided it\nwould likely follow that post-SORNA interstate travel would also be\nrequired. (This is the case because, as previously explained, there is a\nstrong argument that \u00a72250(a) requires interstate travel that comes\nafter a qualifying conviction.)\n  Now that the Attorney General has decided that \u00a72250(a) reaches\npersons with pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, however, the relevant\nquestion is this: Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted\nto draw a distinction between (1) persons with pre-SORNA convictions\nand pre-SORNA travel and (2) persons with pre-SORNA convictions\nand post-SORNA travel? And to this question, the Court offers no\nplausible answer.\n  10 Petitioner makes the additional argument that interpreting\n\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(B) to reach pre-enactment travel renders the statute an\nunlawful ex post facto law. See U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3. Petitioner\nremained unregistered in Indiana five months after the promulgation\nof the regulation making SORNA applicable to persons with pre-\nSORNA sex-offense convictions. For essentially the reasons explained\nby the Court of Appeals, see United States v. Dixon, 551 F. 3d, at 585\u2013\n587, I would reject petitioner\u2019s ex post facto argument.\n</pre>",
