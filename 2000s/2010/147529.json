THOMPKINS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u20131470. Argued March 1, 2010\u2014Decided June 1, 2010\nAfter advising respondent Thompkins of his rights, in full compliance\n  with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, Detective Helgert and an\n  other Michigan officer interrogated him about a shooting in which\n  one victim died. At no point did Thompkins say that he wanted to\n  remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he\n  wanted an attorney. He was largely silent during the 3-hour interro\n  gation, but near the end, he answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if he prayed\n  to God to forgive him for the shooting. He moved to suppress his\n  statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right\n  to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his in\n  culpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the\n  motion. At trial on first-degree murder and other charges, the prose\n  cution called Eric Purifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins\n  and a third accomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and\n  who had been convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder\n  and assault. Thompkins\u2019 defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.\n  Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots. During clos\n  ing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not\n  seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoy\u2019s jury had made the\n  right decision. Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the\n  jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial\n  only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins\u2019 guilt. The\n  jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison\n  without parole. In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court\n  rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\n  for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Puri\n  foy\u2019s trial. On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both\n  Thompkins\u2019 Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims. The Fed\n2                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    eral District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning\n    that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\n    coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it\n    was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective\n    Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), for\n    the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right\n    to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state\n    court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins\u2019\n    right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n    counsel claim.\nHeld:\n    1. The state court\u2019s decision rejecting Thompkins\u2019 Miranda claim\n was correct under de novo review and therefore necessarily reason\n able under AEDPA\u2019s more deferential standard of review. Pp. 7\u201317.\n       (a) Thompkins\u2019 silence during the interrogation did not invoke\n his right to remain silent. A suspect\u2019s Miranda right to counsel must\n be invoked \u201cunambiguously.\u201d Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,\n 459. If the accused makes an \u201cambiguous or equivocal\u201d statement or\n no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation,\n ibid., or ask questions to clarify the accused\u2019s intent, id., at 461\u2013462.\n There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for deter\n mining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain si\n lent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis. Both protect\n the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an\n interrogation to cease when either right is invoked. The unambigu\n ous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that\n \u201cavoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to officers\u201d\n on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis, supra, at 458\u2013459.\n Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did\n not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the question\n ing. He did neither. Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (b) Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he know\n ingly and voluntarily made a statement to police. A waiver must be\n \u201cthe product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,\n coercion, or deception\u201d and \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the\n nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the de\n cision to abandon it.\u201d Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421. Such a\n waiver may be \u201cimplied\u201d through a \u201cdefendant\u2019s silence, coupled with\n an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating\n waiver.\u201d North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373. If the State\n establishes that a Miranda warning was given and that it was un\n derstood by the accused, an accused\u2019s uncoerced statement estab\n lishes an implied waiver. The record here shows that Thompkins\n waived his right to remain silent. First, the lack of any contention\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthat he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he\ngave up when he spoke. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Second, his an\nswer to the question about God is a \u201ccourse of conduct indicating\nwaiver\u201d of that right. Butler, supra, at 373. Had he wanted to re\nmain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambigu\nously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation. That he\nmade a statement nearly three hours after receiving a Miranda\nwarning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of\nconduct indicating waiver. Third, there is no evidence that his\nstatement was coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. He does not\nclaim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.\nThe interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle\nof the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour\ninterrogation is inherently coercive. Cf. Colorado v. Connelly, 479\nU. S. 157, 163\u2013164, n. 1. The fact that the question referred to reli\ngious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary. Id., at\n170. Pp. 10\u201315.\n      (c) Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could\nconstitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not\nallowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver. However,\na rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with\nButler\u2019s holding that courts can infer a waiver \u201cfrom the actions and\nwords of the person interrogated.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. Any waiver, ex\npress or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time,\nterminating further interrogation. When the suspect knows that\nMiranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his\nor her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation pro\ngresses. After giving a Miranda warning, police may interrogate a\nsuspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights. Thus,\nthe police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins\u2019\nMiranda rights before interrogating him. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   2. Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins\ncannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record. To es\ntablish ineffective assistance, a defendant \u201cmust show both deficient\nperformance and prejudice.\u201d Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___,\n___. To establish prejudice, a \u201cdefendant must show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 694, considering \u201cthe totality of the evi\ndence before the judge or jury,\u201d id., at 695. Here, the Sixth Circuit\ndid not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.\nThe state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence\nof Purifoy\u2019s earlier conviction. Even if it used an incorrect legal stan\ndard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPA\u2019s deferential\n4                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show preju\n    dice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him. De\n    novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will\n    not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo re\n    view. See \u00a72254(a). Assuming that failure to request a limiting in\n    struction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show\n    prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that\n    such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other\n    evidence of guilt. The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the\n    shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance cam\n    era photograph. A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him,\n    and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that\n    Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting. The\n    jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy\u2019s credibility, as it\n    was instructed to do.

VAN \n\n           CHESTER THOMPKINS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir\ncuit, in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging a Michi\ngan conviction for first-degree murder and certain other\noffenses, ruled that there had been two separate constitu\ntional errors in the trial that led to the jury\u2019s guilty ver\ndict. First, the Court of Appeals determined that a state\nment by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution,\nhad been elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for\nan instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice\nwas ineffective assistance by defense counsel. See Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Both of these\ncontentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in\nthe habeas corpus proceedings before the United States\nDistrict Court. Certiorari was granted to review the deci\nsion by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden\nof a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here,\nand Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the\nrespondent.\n2                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall\nin Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims was Samuel\nMorris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The\nother victim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries\nand later testified. Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled.\nAbout one year later he was found in Ohio and arrested\nthere.\n  Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to inter\nrogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan.\nThe interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted\nabout three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a\nroom that was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair\nthat resembled a school desk (it had an arm on it that\nswings around to provide a surface to write on). App.\n144a\u2013145a. At the beginning of the interrogation, one of\nthe officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins with\na form derived from the Miranda rule. It stated:\n     \u201cNOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n                       AND STATEMENT\n    \u201c1. You have the right to remain silent.\n    \u201c2. Anything you say can and will be used against\n    you in a court of law.\n    \u201c3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before an\n    swering any questions and you have the right to have\n    a lawyer present with you while you are answering\n    any questions.\n    \u201c4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be\n    appointed to represent you before any questioning, if\n    you wish one.\n    \u201c5. You have the right to decide at any time before or\n    during questioning to use your right to remain silent\n    and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are be\n    ing questioned.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 60 (some capi\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Helgert later said\nthis was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and Hel\ngert concluded that Thompkins understood English. Id.,\nat 9a. Helgert then read the other four Miranda warnings\nout loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demon\nstrate that he understood his rights. App. 8a\u20139a. Thomp\nkins declined to sign the form. The record contains con\nflicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally\nconfirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.\nCompare id., at 9a (at a suppression hearing, Helgert\ntestified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that he un\nderstood his rights), with id., at 148a (at trial, Helgert\nstated, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I orally asked him\u201d whether\nThompkins understood his rights).\n   Officers began an interrogation. At no point during the\ninterrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to re\nmain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or\nthat he wanted an attorney. Id., at 10a. Thompkins was\n\u201c[l]argely\u201d silent during the interrogation, which lasted\nabout three hours. Id., at 19a. He did give a few limited\nverbal responses, however, such as \u201cyeah,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d And on occasion he communicated by nodding his\nhead. Id., at 23a. Thompkins also said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t\nwant a peppermint\u201d that was offered to him by the police\nand that the chair he was \u201csitting in was hard.\u201d Id., at\n152a.\n   About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation,\nHelgert asked Thompkins, \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d Id., at\n11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and\nsaid \u201cYes,\u201d as his eyes \u201cwell[ed] up with tears.\u201d Id., at 11a.\nHelgert asked, \u201cDo you pray to God?\u201d Thompkins said\n\u201cYes.\u201d Id., at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, \u201cDo you pray to\nGod to forgive you for shooting that boy down?\u201d Id., at\n4                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n153a. Thompkins answered \u201cYes\u201d and looked away. Ibid.\nThompkins refused to make a written confession, and the\ninterrogation ended about 15 minutes later. Id., at 11a.\n  Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder,\nassault with intent to commit murder, and certain fire\narms-related offenses. He moved to suppress the state\nments made during the interrogation. He argued that he\nhad invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,\nrequiring police to end the interrogation at once, see\nMichigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103 (1975) (citing\nMiranda, 384 U. S., at 474), that he had not waived his\nright to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements\nwere involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.\n  At trial, the prosecution\u2019s theory was that Thompkins\nshot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven\nby Eric Purifoy. Purifoy testified that he had been driving\nthe van and that Thompkins was in the passenger seat\nwhile another man, one Myzell Woodward, was in the\nback. The defense strategy was to pin the blame on Puri\nfoy. Purifoy testified he did not see who fired the weapon\nbecause the van was stopped and he was bending over\nnear the floor when shots were fired. Purifoy explained\nthat, just after the shooting, Thompkins, holding a pistol,\ntold Purifoy, \u201cWhat the hell you doing? Pull off.\u201d Purifoy\nthen drove away from the scene. App. 170a.\n  So that the Thompkins jury could assess Purifoy\u2019s credi\nbility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited testimony\nfrom Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the shoot\ning under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Purifoy and\nDetective Helgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the\nmurder and assault charges, convicted him of carrying a\nconcealed weapon in a motor vehicle, and hung on two\nother firearms offenses to which he later pleaded guilty.\nAt Purifoy\u2019s trial, the prosecution had argued that Purifoy\nwas the driver and Thompkins was the shooter. This was\nconsistent with the prosecution\u2019s argument at Thomp\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nkins\u2019s trial.\n   After Purifoy\u2019s trial had ended\u2014but before Thompkins\u2019s\ntrial began\u2014Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters. The\nletters expressed Purifoy\u2019s disappointment that Thomp\nkins\u2019s family thought Purifoy was a \u201csnitch\u201d and a \u201crat.\u201d\nId., at 179a\u2013180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a\ncopy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that\nPurifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the\nshooting. Id., at 180a. The letters also contained state\nments by Purifoy that claimed they were both innocent.\nId., at 178a\u2013179a. At Thompkins\u2019s trial, the prosecution\nsuggested that one of Purifoy\u2019s letters appeared to give\nThompkins a trial strategy. It was, the prosecution sug\ngested, that Woodward shot the victims, allowing Purifoy\nand Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the\nshooting started. Id., at 187a\u2013189a.\n   During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested\nthat Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see\nThompkins shoot the victims:\n    \u201cDid Eric Purifoy\u2019s Jury make the right decision? I\u2019m\n    not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his\n    Jury found. Take his testimony for what it was, [a]\n    twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but\n    his tight buddy.\u201d Id., at 202a.\nDefense counsel did not object. Defense counsel also did\nnot ask for an instruction informing the jury that it could\nconsider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial only to\nassess Purifoy\u2019s credibility, not to establish Thompkins\u2019s\nguilt.\n  The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was\nsentenced to life in prison without parole.\n                           B\n  The trial court denied a motion for new trial filed by\nThompkins\u2019s appellate counsel. The trial court rejected\n6                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for fail\nure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome\nof Purifoy\u2019s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice\nThompkins. Id., at 236a.\n   Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under\nMiranda. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the\nMiranda claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked\nhis right to remain silent and had waived it. It also re\njected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding\nthat Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy\u2019s\nconviction for firearms offenses resulted in prejudice.

The District Court reasoned that Thompkins\ndid not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\ncoerced into making statements during the interrogation.\nIt held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not\nunreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nreversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his Miranda and\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547 F. 3d 572\n(2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in\nrejecting Thompkins\u2019s Miranda claim, unreasonably ap\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplied clearly established federal law and based its decision\non an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be\nexpress, as it can be \u201c \u2018inferred from the actions and words\nof the person interrogated.\u2019 \u201d 547 F. 3d, at 582 (quoting\nNorth Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979)). The\npanel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unrea\nsonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances\nhere. The Court of Appeals found that the state court\nunreasonably determined the facts because \u201cthe evidence\ndemonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours\nand forty-five minutes.\u201d 547 F. 3d, at 586. According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Thompkins\u2019s \u201cpersistent silence for\nnearly three hours in response to questioning and re\npeated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a\nclear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins\ndid not wish to waive his rights.\u201d Id., at 588.\n  The Court of Appeals next determined that the state\ncourt unreasonably applied clearly established federal law\nby rejecting Thompkins\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim based on counsel\u2019s failure to ask for a limiting in\nstruction regarding Purifoy\u2019s acquittal. The Court of\nAppeals asserted that because Thompkins\u2019s central strat\negy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reason\nable probability that the result of Thompkins\u2019s trial would\nhave been different if there had been a limiting instruction\nregarding Purifoy\u2019s acquittal.\n  We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            II\n  Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a habeas\ncorpus application \u201cwith respect to any claim that was\nadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d 28\nU.

See Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). The relevant state-court\ndecision here is the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\naffirming Thompkins\u2019s conviction and rejecting his\nMiranda and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on\nthe merits.\n                            III\n  The Miranda Court formulated a warning that must be\ngiven to suspects before they can be subjected to custodial\ninterrogation. The substance of the warning still must be\ngiven to suspects today. A suspect in custody must be\nadvised as follows:\n    \u201cHe must be warned prior to any questioning that he\n    has the right to remain silent, that anything he says\n    can be used against him in a court of law, that he has\n    the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\n    cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for\n    him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d 384\n    U. S., at 479.\nAll concede that the warning given in this case was in full\ncompliance with these requirements. The dispute centers\non the response\u2014or nonresponse\u2014from the suspect.\n                             A\n   Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers\nto questions from the detectives were inadmissible. He\nfirst contends that he \u201cinvoke[d] his privilege\u201d to remain\nsilent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of\ntime, so the interrogation should have \u201ccease[d]\u201d before he\nmade his inculpatory statements. Id., at 474; see Mosley,\n423 U. S., at 103 (police must \u201c \u2018scrupulously hono[r]\u2019 \u201d this\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201ccritical safeguard\u201d when the accused invokes his or her\n\u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 \u201d (quoting Miranda, supra, at\n474, 479)).\n    This argument is unpersuasive. In the context of invok\ning the Miranda right to counsel, the Court in Davis v.\nUnited States, 512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994), held that a sus\npect must do so \u201cunambiguously.\u201d If an accused makes a\nstatement concerning the right to counsel \u201cthat is ambigu\nous or equivocal\u201d or makes no statement, the police are not\nrequired to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to\nclarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her\nMiranda rights, 512 U. S., at 461\u2013462.\n    The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of\nthe right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal,\nbut there is no principled reason to adopt different stan\ndards for determining when an accused has invoked the\nMiranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to\ncounsel at issue in Davis. See, e.g., Solem v. Stumes, 465\nU. S. 638, 648 (1984) (\u201c[M]uch of the logic and language of\n[Mosley],\u201d which discussed the Miranda right to remain\nsilent, \u201ccould be applied to the invocation of the [Miranda\nright to counsel]\u201d). Both protect the privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination, Miranda, supra, at 467\u2013\n473, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either\nright is invoked, Mosley, supra, at 103 (citing Miranda,\nsupra, at 474); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719\n(1979).\n    There is good reason to require an accused who wants to\ninvoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambigu\nously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of\nMiranda rights results in an objective inquiry that\n\u201cavoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to\nofficers\u201d on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis,\n512 U. S., at 458\u2013459. If an ambiguous act, omission, or\nstatement could require police to end the interrogation,\npolice would be required to make difficult decisions about\n10                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan accused\u2019s unclear intent and face the consequence of\nsuppression \u201cif they guess wrong.\u201d Id., at 461. Suppres\nsion of a voluntary confession in these circumstances\nwould place a significant burden on society\u2019s interest in\nprosecuting criminal activity. See id., at 459\u2013461; Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 427 (1986). Treating an am\nbiguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an\ninvocation of Miranda rights \u201cmight add marginally to\nMiranda\u2019s goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in\ncustodial interrogation.\u201d Burbine, 475 U. S., at 425. But\n\u201cas Miranda holds, full comprehension of the rights to\nremain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to\ndispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation\nprocess.\u201d Id., at 427; see Davis, supra, at 460.\n  Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent\nor that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he\nmade either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he\nwould have invoked his \u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning.\u2019 \u201d\nMosley, supra, at 103 (quoting Miranda, supra, at 474).\nHere he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to re\nmain silent.\n                              B\n   We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right\nto remain silent. Even absent the accused\u2019s invocation of\nthe right to remain silent, the accused\u2019s statement during\na custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the\nprosecution can establish that the accused \u201cin fact know\ningly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights\u201d when\nmaking the statement. Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. The\nwaiver inquiry \u201chas two distinct dimensions\u201d: waiver must\nbe \u201cvoluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free\nand deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,\nor deception,\u201d and \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the\nnature of the right being abandoned and the consequences\nof the decision to abandon it.\u201d Burbine, supra, at 421.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Some language in Miranda could be read to indicate\nthat waivers are difficult to establish absent an explicit\nwritten waiver or a formal, express oral statement.\nMiranda said \u201ca valid waiver will not be presumed simply\nfrom the silence of the accused after warnings are given or\nsimply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventu\nally obtained.\u201d 384 U. S., at 475; see id., at 470 (\u201cNo effec\ntive waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically made\nafter the [Miranda] warnings . . . have been given\u201d). In\naddition, the Miranda Court stated that \u201ca heavy burden\nrests on the government to demonstrate that the defen\ndant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination and his right to retained or\nappointed counsel.\u201d Id., at 475.\n   The course of decisions since Miranda, informed by the\napplication of Miranda warnings in the whole course of\nlaw enforcement, demonstrates that waivers can be estab\nlished even absent formal or express statements of waiver\nthat would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to de\ntermine if a guilty plea has been properly entered. Cf.\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11. The main purpose of Miranda is\nto ensure that an accused is advised of and understands\nthe right to remain silent and the right to counsel. See\nDavis, supra, at 460; Burbine, supra, at 427. Thus, \u201c[i]f\nanything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact\nof the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while\nreaffirming the decision\u2019s core ruling that unwarned\nstatements may not be used as evidence in the prosecu\ntion\u2019s case in chief.\u201d Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S.\n428, 443\u2013444 (2000).\n   One of the first cases to decide the meaning and import\nof Miranda with respect to the question of waiver was\nNorth Carolina v. Butler. The Butler Court, after discuss\ning some of the problems created by the language in\nMiranda, established certain important propositions.\nButler interpreted the Miranda language concerning the\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cheavy burden\u201d to show waiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in ac\ncord with usual principles of determining waiver, which\ncan include waiver implied from all the circumstances.\nSee Butler, supra, at 373, 376. And in a later case, the\nCourt stated that this \u201cheavy burden\u201d is not more than the\nburden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).\n  The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a\nwaiver of Miranda rights was express. An \u201cimplicit\nwaiver\u201d of the \u201cright to remain silent\u201d is sufficient to admit\na suspect\u2019s statement into evidence. Butler, supra, at 376.\nButler made clear that a waiver of Miranda rights may be\nimplied through \u201cthe defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an\nunderstanding of his rights and a course of conduct indi\ncating waiver.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. The Court in Butler\ntherefore \u201cretreated\u201d from the \u201clanguage and tenor of the\nMiranda opinion,\u201d which \u201csuggested that the Court would\nrequire that a waiver . . . be \u2018specifically made.\u2019 \u201d Con\nnecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 531\u2013532 (1987) (Bren\nnan, J., concurring in judgment).\n  If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was\ngiven and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this\nshowing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate \u201ca\nvalid waiver\u201d of Miranda rights. Miranda, supra, at 475.\nThe prosecution must make the additional showing that\nthe accused understood these rights. See Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573\u2013575 (1987); Barrett, supra, at\n530; Burbine, supra, at 421\u2013422. Cf. Tague v. Louisiana,\n444 U. S. 469, 469, 471 (1980) (per curiam) (no evidence\nthat accused understood his Miranda rights); Carnley v.\nCochran, 369 U. S. 506, 516 (1962) (government could not\nshow that accused \u201cunderstandingly\u201d waived his right to\ncounsel in light of \u201csilent record\u201d). Where the prosecution\nshows that a Miranda warning was given and that it was\nunderstood by the accused, an accused\u2019s uncoerced state\nment establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsilent.\n   Although Miranda imposes on the police a rule that is\nboth formalistic and practical when it prevents them from\ninterrogating suspects without first providing them with a\nMiranda warning, see Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427, it does\nnot impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect\nmust follow to relinquish those rights. As a general\nproposition, the law can presume that an individual who,\nwith a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with their exercise has made a delib\nerate choice to relinquish the protection those rights af\nford. See, e.g., Butler, supra, at 372\u2013376; Connelly, supra,\nat 169\u2013170 (\u201cThere is obviously no reason to require more\nin the way of a \u2018voluntariness\u2019 inquiry in the Miranda\nwaiver context than in the [due process] confession con\ntext\u201d). The Court\u2019s cases have recognized that a waiver of\nMiranda rights need only meet the standard of Johnson v.\nZerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938). See Butler, supra, at\n374\u2013375; Miranda, supra, at 475\u2013476 (applying Zerbst\nstandard of intentional relinquishment of a known right).\nAs Butler recognized, 441 U. S., at 375\u2013376, Miranda\nrights can therefore be waived through means less formal\nthan a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and\nnecessities of interrogation and the fact that Miranda\u2019s\nmain protection lies in advising defendants of their rights,\nsee Davis, 512 U. S., at 460; Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427.\n   The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived\nhis right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case to\nconclude that he did not understand his rights; and on\nthese facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on\nthose rights when he did speak. First, there is no conten\ntion that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and\nfrom this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he\nspoke. See id., at 421. There was more than enough\nevidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins under\n14               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstood his Miranda rights. Thompkins received a written\ncopy of the Miranda warnings; Detective Helgert deter\nmined that Thompkins could read and understand Eng\nlish; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings.\nThompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning,\nwhich stated that \u201cyou have the right to decide at any time\nbefore or during questioning to use your right to remain\nsilent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are\nbeing questioned.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 60 (capitalization\nomitted). He was thus aware that his right to remain\nsilent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time\nand that police would have to honor his right to be silent\nand his right to counsel during the whole course of inter\nrogation. Those rights, the warning made clear, could be\nasserted at any time. Helgert, moreover, read the warn\nings aloud.\n   Second, Thompkins\u2019s answer to Detective Helgert\u2019s\nquestion about whether Thompkins prayed to God for\nforgiveness for shooting the victim is a \u201ccourse of conduct\nindicating waiver\u201d of the right to remain silent. Butler,\nsupra, at 373. If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he\ncould have said nothing in response to Helgert\u2019s questions,\nor he could have unambiguously invoked his Miranda\nrights and ended the interrogation. The fact that Thomp\nkins made a statement about three hours after receiving a\nMiranda warning does not overcome the fact that he\nengaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. Police\nare not required to rewarn suspects from time to time.\nThompkins\u2019s answer to Helgert\u2019s question about praying\nto God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was suffi\ncient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. This\nis confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins\nhad given sporadic answers to questions throughout the\ninterrogation.\n   Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins\u2019s statement\nwas coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Thompkins does\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot claim that police threatened or injured him during the\ninterrogation or that he was in any way fearful. The\ninterrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in\nthe middle of the afternoon. It is true that apparently he\nwas in a straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is\nno authority for the proposition that an interrogation of\nthis length is inherently coercive. Indeed, even where\ninterrogations of greater duration were held to be im\nproper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by\nother facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated\nand sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and\nthreats. Cf. Connelly, 479 U. S., at 163\u2013164, n. 1. The fact\nthat Helgert\u2019s question referred to Thompkins\u2019s religious\nbeliefs also did not render Thompkins\u2019s statement invol\nuntary. \u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not con\ncerned \u2018with moral and psychological pressures to confess\nemanating from sources other than official coercion.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 170 (quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305\n(1985)). In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly\nand voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n                             C\n  Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to\nDetective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to\nremain silent, the police were not allowed to question him\nuntil they obtained a waiver first. Butler forecloses this\nargument. The Butler Court held that courts can infer a\nwaiver of Miranda rights \u201cfrom the actions and words of\nthe person interrogated.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. This principle\nwould be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at\nthe outset. The Butler Court thus rejected the rule pro\nposed by the Butler dissent, which would have \u201crequir[ed]\nthe police to obtain an express waiver of [Miranda rights]\nbefore proceeding with interrogation.\u201d Id., at 379 (Bren\nnan, J., dissenting). This holding also makes sense given\n16               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat \u201cthe primary protection afforded suspects subject[ed]\nto custodial interrogation is the Miranda warnings them\nselves.\u201d Davis, 512 U. S., at 460. The Miranda rule and\nits requirements are met if a suspect receives adequate\nMiranda warnings, understands them, and has an oppor\ntunity to invoke the rights before giving any answers or\nadmissions. Any waiver, express or implied, may be con\ntradicted by an invocation at any time. If the right to\ncounsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any\npoint during questioning, further interrogation must\ncease.\n   Interrogation provides the suspect with additional\ninformation that can put his or her decision to waive, or\nnot to invoke, into perspective. As questioning commences\nand then continues, the suspect has the opportunity to\nconsider the choices he or she faces and to make a more\ninformed decision, either to insist on silence or to cooper\nate. When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be\ninvoked at any time, he or she has the opportunity to\nreassess his or her immediate and long-term interests.\nCooperation with the police may result in more favorable\ntreatment for the suspect; the apprehension of accom\nplices; the prevention of continuing injury and fear; begin\nning steps towards relief or solace for the victims; and the\nbeginning of the suspect\u2019s own return to the law and the\nsocial order it seeks to protect.\n   In order for an accused\u2019s statement to be admissible at\ntrial, police must have given the accused a Miranda warn\ning. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471. If that condition is\nestablished, the court can proceed to consider whether\nthere has been an express or implied waiver of Miranda\nrights. Id., at 476. In making its ruling on the admissibil\nity of a statement made during custodial questioning, the\ntrial court, of course, considers whether there is evidence\nto support the conclusion that, from the whole course of\nquestioning, an express or implied waiver has been estab\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlished. Thus, after giving a Miranda warning, police may\ninterrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived\nhis or her Miranda rights. On these premises, it fol-\nlows the police were not required to obtain a waiver of\nThompkins\u2019s Miranda rights before commencing the\ninterrogation.\n                             D\n   In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the\nMiranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda\nrights, waives the right to remain silent by making an\nuncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not\ninvoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning.\nUnderstanding his rights in full, he waived his right to\nremain silent by making a voluntary statement to the\npolice. The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a\nwaiver of Thompkins\u2019s right to remain silent before inter\nrogating him. The state court\u2019s decision rejecting Thomp\nkins\u2019s Miranda claim was thus correct under de novo\nreview and therefore necessarily reasonable under the\nmore deferential AEDPA standard of review, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d). See Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)\n(state court\u2019s decision was correct under de novo review\nand not unreasonable under AEDPA).\n                             IV\n  The second issue in this case is whether Thompkins\u2019s\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to re\nquest a limiting instruction regarding how the jury could\nconsider the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial. To establish inef\nfective assistance of counsel, a defendant \u201cmust show both\ndeficient performance and prejudice.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (citing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687). To establish\nprejudice, a \u201cdefendant must show that there is a reason\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\n18               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nferent.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. In assessing preju\ndice, courts \u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence\nbefore the judge or jury.\u201d Id., at 695. The Court of Ap\npeals, however, neglected to take into account the other\nevidence presented against Thompkins.\n   The Court of Appeals determined that the state court\nwas unreasonable, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d), when it found that\nThompkins suffered no prejudice from failure of defense\ncounsel to request an instruction regarding Purifoy\u2019s\nearlier acquittal of the murder and assault charges. The\nstate court had rejected Thompkins\u2019s claim that he was\nprejudiced by evidence of Purifoy\u2019s earlier conviction for\nfirearms offenses, noting that \u201cthe record does not disclose\nan attempt to argue that conviction for an improper pur\npose.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. It is unclear what preju\ndice standard the state court applied. The Court of Ap\npeals ruled that the state court used the incorrect\nstandard for assessing prejudice under Strickland because\n\u201c[q]uestions of the prosecution\u2019s purpose or intent are\ncompletely irrelevant in analyzing whether an error re\nsulted in prejudice, which by definition concerns the er\nror\u2019s effect upon the outcome.\u201d 547 F. 3d, at 591\u2013592\n(emphasis deleted).\n   Even if the state court used an incorrect legal standard,\nwe need not determine whether AEDPA\u2019s deferential\nstandard of review, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d), applies in this\nsituation. Cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 397\u2013398\n(2000). That is because, even if AEDPA deference does not\napply, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under de novo\nreview, the more favorable standard of review for Thomp\nkins. Courts cannot grant writs of habeas corpus under\n\u00a72254 by engaging only in de novo review when it is un\nclear whether AEDPA deference applies, \u00a72254(d). In\nthose situations, courts must resolve whether AEDPA\ndeference applies, because if it does, a habeas petitioner\nmay not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72254(d). Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas\ncorpus under \u00a72254 by engaging in de novo review when it\nis unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a\nhabeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas\ncorpus if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review, see\n\u00a72254(a).\n  It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction\nabout the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient\nrepresentation; but on the assumption that it was, on this\nrecord Thompkins cannot show prejudice. The record\nestablishes that it was not reasonably likely that the\ninstruction would have made any difference in light of all\nthe other evidence of guilt. The surviving victim, Freder\nick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the\nidentification was supported by a photograph taken from a\nsurveillance camera. Thompkins\u2019s friend Omar Stephens\ntestified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone\nconversation, and the details of that confession were cor\nroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped the van\nand abandoned it after the shooting. The jury, moreover,\nwas capable of assessing Purifoy\u2019s credibility, as it was\ninstructed to do. The jury in Thompkins\u2019s case could have\nconcluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy\u2019s case made a\nmistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact\nguilty of the crime for which he had been charged. There\nwas ample evidence in the record to support Thompkins\u2019s\nguilt under either theory, and his jury was instructed to\nweigh all of the evidence in determining whether there\nwas guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Under our de novo\nreview of this record, Thompkins cannot show prejudice.\n                     *   *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,\nand the case is remanded with instructions to deny the\npetition.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

VAN \n\n           CHESTER THOMPKINS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS,\nJUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.\n   The Court concludes today that a criminal suspect\nwaives his right to remain silent if, after sitting tacit and\nuncommunicative through nearly three hours of police\ninterrogation, he utters a few one-word responses. The\nCourt also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard\nhis right to remain silent against such a finding of\n\u201cwaiver\u201d must, counterintuitively, speak\u2014and must do so\nwith sufficient precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule\nthat construes ambiguity in favor of the police. Both\npropositions mark a substantial retreat from the protec\u00ad\ntion against compelled self-incrimination that Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), has long provided during\ncustodial interrogation. The broad rules the Court an\u00ad\nnounces today are also troubling because they are unnec\u00ad\nessary to decide this case, which is governed by the defer\u00ad\nential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d). Because I believe Thompkins is entitled\nto relief under AEDPA on the ground that his statements\nwere admitted at trial without the prosecution having\ncarried its burden to show that he waived his right to\nremain silent; because longstanding principles of judicial\nrestraint counsel leaving for another day the questions of\n2                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlaw the Court reaches out to decide; and because the\nCourt\u2019s answers to those questions do not result from a\nfaithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                              I\n   We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that\nThompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both\nMiranda and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). 547 F. 3d 572 (2008). As to the Miranda claims,\nThompkins argues first that through his conduct during\nthe 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked\nhis right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off ques\u00ad\ntioning in accordance with Miranda and Michigan v.\nMosley, 423 U. S. 96 (1975). Thompkins also contends his\nstatements were in any case inadmissible because the\nprosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under\nMiranda of proving that he knowingly and intelligently\nwaived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit\nagreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach\nthe question of invocation. 547 F. 3d, at 583\u2013584, n. 4. In\nmy view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invoca\u00ad\ntion claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to\nwaiver. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth\nCircuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins\u2019\nclaim that he received constitutionally ineffective assis\u00ad\ntance of counsel.\n   The strength of Thompkins\u2019 Miranda claims depends in\nlarge part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interroga\u00ad\ntion, at the end of which he made inculpatory statements\nlater introduced at trial. The Court\u2019s opinion downplays\nrecord evidence that Thompkins remained almost com\u00ad\npletely silent and unresponsive throughout that session.\nOne of the interrogating officers, Detective Helgert, testi\u00ad\nfied that although Thompkins was administered Miranda\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwarnings, the last of which he read aloud, Thompkins\nexpressly declined to sign a written acknowledgment that\nhe had been advised of and understood his rights. There\nis conflicting evidence in the record about whether\nThompkins ever verbally confirmed understanding his\nrights.1 The record contains no indication that the officers\nsought or obtained an express waiver.\n   As to the interrogation itself, Helgert candidly charac\u00ad\nterized it as \u201cvery, very one-sided\u201d and \u201cnearly a mono\u00ad\nlogue.\u201d App. 10a, 17a. Thompkins was \u201c[p]eculiar,\u201d\n\u201c[s]ullen,\u201d and \u201c[g]enerally quiet.\u201d Id., at 149a. Helgert\nand his partner \u201cdid most of the talking,\u201d as Thompkins\nwas \u201cnot verbally communicative\u201d and \u201c[l]argely\u201d re\u00ad\nmained silent. Id., at 149a, 17a, 19a. To the extent\nThompkins gave any response, his answers consisted of \u201ca\nword or two. A \u2018yeah,\u2019 or a \u2018no,\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 . . . And\nsometimes . . . he simply sat down . . . with [his] head in\n[his] hands looking down. Sometimes . . . he would look up\nand make eye-contact would be the only response.\u201d Id., at\n23a\u201324a. After proceeding in this fashion for approxi\u00ad\nmately 2 hours and 45 minutes, Helgert asked Thompkins\nthree questions relating to his faith in God. The prosecu\u00ad\ntion relied at trial on Thompkins\u2019 one-word answers of\n\u201cyes.\u201d See id., at 10a\u201311a.\n   Thompkins\u2019 nonresponsiveness is particularly striking\nin the context of the officers\u2019 interview strategy, later\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At the suppression hearing, Detective Helgert testified that after\nreading Thompkins the warnings, \u201cI believe I asked him if he under\u00ad\nstood the Rights, and I think I got a verbal answer to that as a \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d\nApp. 9a. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court relied on\nthat factual premise. Id., at 26a. In his later testimony at trial, Hel\u00ad\ngert remembered the encounter differently. Asked whether Thompkins\n\u201cindicate[d] that he understood [the warnings]\u201d after they had been\nread, Helgert stated \u201cI don\u2019t know that I orally asked him that ques\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Id., at 148a. Nevertheless, the Michigan Court of Appeals stated\nthat Thompkins verbally acknowledged understanding his rights. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n4                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nexplained as conveying to Thompkins that \u201cthis was his\nopportunity to explain his side [of the story]\u201d because\n\u201c[e]verybody else, including [his] co-[d]efendants, had\ngiven their version,\u201d and asking him \u201c[w]ho is going to\nspeak up for you if you don\u2019t speak up for yourself?\u201d Id., at\n10a, 21a. Yet, Helgert confirmed that the \u201conly thing\n[Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shoot\u00ad\ning]\u201d occurred near the end of the interview\u2014i.e., in re\u00ad\nsponse to the questions about God. Id., at 10a\u201311a (em\u00ad\nphasis added). The only other responses Helgert could\nremember Thompkins giving were that \u201c \u2018[h]e didn\u2019t want\na peppermint\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018the chair that he was sitting in was\nhard.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 152a. Nevertheless, the Michigan court\nconcluded on this record that Thompkins had not invoked\nhis right to remain silent because \u201che continued to talk\nwith the officer, albeit sporadically,\u201d and that he voluntar\u00ad\nily waived that right. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n   Thompkins\u2019 federal habeas petition is governed by\nAEDPA, under which a federal court may not grant the\nwrit unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits of\nthe claim at issue \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unrea\u00ad\nsonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d\nor \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72254(d)(1), (2).\n   The relevant clearly established federal law for purposes\nof \u00a72254(d)(1) begins with our landmark Miranda decision,\nwhich \u201cg[a]ve force to the Constitution\u2019s protection against\ncompelled self-incrimination\u201d by establishing \u201c \u2018certain\nprocedural safeguards that require police to advise crimi\u00ad\nnal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Four\u00ad\nteenth Amendments before commencing custodial interro\u00ad\ngation,\u2019 \u201d Florida v.

Miranda and our subse\u00ad\nquent cases also require police to \u201crespect the accused\u2019s\ndecision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.\u201d\nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 420 (1986). \u201cIf [an]\nindividual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or\nduring questioning, that he wishes to remain silent\u201d or if\nhe \u201cstates that he wants an attorney,\u201d the interrogation\n\u201cmust cease.\u201d 384 U. S., at 473\u2013474.\n  Even when warnings have been administered and a\nsuspect has not affirmatively invoked his rights, state\u00ad\nments made in custodial interrogation may not be admit\u00ad\nted as part of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief \u201cunless and\nuntil\u201d the prosecution demonstrates that an individual\n\u201cknowingly and intelligently waive[d] [his] rights.\u201d Id., at\n479; accord, ante, at 10. \u201c[A] heavy burden rests on the\ngovernment to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly\nand intelligently waived his privilege against self\u00ad\nincrimination and his right to retained or appointed coun\u00ad\nsel.\u201d Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475. The government must\nsatisfy the \u201chigh standar[d] of proof for the waiver of\nconstitutional rights [set forth in] Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\nU. S. 458 (1938).\u201d Ibid.\n  The question whether a suspect has validly waived his\nright is \u201centirely distinct\u201d as a matter of law from whether\nhe invoked that right. Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 98\n(1984) (per curiam). The questions are related, however,\nin terms of the practical effect on the exercise of a sus\u00ad\npect\u2019s rights. A suspect may at any time revoke his prior\nwaiver of rights\u2014or, closer to the facts of this case, guard\nagainst the possibility of a future finding that he implicitly\nwaived his rights\u2014by invoking the rights and thereby\nrequiring the police to cease questioning. Accord, ante, at\n16.\n6                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n   Like the Sixth Circuit, I begin with the question\nwhether Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.\nEven if Thompkins did not invoke that right, he is entitled\nto relief because Michigan did not satisfy its burden of\nestablishing waiver.\n   Miranda\u2019s discussion of the prosecution\u2019s burden in\nproving waiver speaks with particular clarity to the facts\nof this case and therefore merits reproducing at length:\n       \u201cIf [an] interrogation continues without the pres\u00ad\n    ence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy\n    burden rests on the government to demonstrate that\n    the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his\n    privilege against self-incrimination and his right to\n    retained or appointed counsel. . . . Since the State is\n    responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances\n    under which [an] interrogation takes place and has\n    the only means of making available corroborated evi\u00ad\n    dence of warnings given during incommunicado inter\u00ad\n    rogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.\n       \u201cAn express statement that the individual is willing\n    to make a statement and does not want an attorney\n    followed closely by a statement could constitute a\n    waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed sim\u00ad\n    ply from the silence of the accused after warnings are\n    given or simply from the fact that a confession was in\n    fact eventually obtained.\u201d 384 U. S., at 475.\n  Miranda went further in describing the facts likely\nto satisfy the prosecution\u2019s burden of establishing the ad\u00ad\nmissibility of statements obtained after a lengthy\ninterrogation:\n      \u201cWhatever the testimony of the authorities as to\n    waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy in\u00ad\n    terrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

In these circum\u00ad\n    stances the fact that the individual eventually made a\n    statement is consistent with the conclusion that the\n    compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced\n    him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a\n    voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.\u201d Id., at\n    476.\n  This Court\u2019s decisions subsequent to Miranda have\nemphasized the prosecution\u2019s \u201cheavy burden\u201d in proving\nwaiver. See, e.g., Tague v. Louisiana, 444 U. S. 469, 470\u2013\n471 (1980) (per curiam); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707,\n724 (1979). We have also reaffirmed that a court may not\npresume waiver from a suspect\u2019s silence or from the mere\nfact that a confession was eventually obtained. See North\nCarolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979).\n  Even in concluding that Miranda does not invariably\nrequire an express waiver of the right to silence or the\nright to counsel, this Court in Butler made clear that the\nprosecution bears a substantial burden in establishing an\nimplied waiver. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had\nobtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and\nconfirming that he understood them. When presented\nwith a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the\nagents, \u201c \u2018I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.\u2019 \u201d\n441 U. S., at 371. He then made inculpatory statements,\nwhich he later sought to suppress on the ground that he\nhad not expressly waived his right to counsel.\n  Although this Court reversed the state-court judgment\nconcluding that the statements were inadmissible, we\nquoted at length portions of the Miranda opinion repro\u00ad\nduced above. We cautioned that even an \u201cexpress written\nor oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or\nof the right to counsel\u201d is not \u201cinevitably . . . sufficient to\nestablish waiver,\u201d emphasizing that \u201c[t]he question is . . .\n8                    BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwhether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived the rights delineated in the Miranda case.\u201d 441\nU. S., at 373. Miranda, we observed, \u201cunequivocally said\n. . . mere silence is not enough.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. While\nwe stopped short in Butler of announcing a per se rule that\n\u201cthe defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of\nhis rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may\nnever support a conclusion that a defendant has waived\nhis rights,\u201d we reiterated that \u201ccourts must presume that a\ndefendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\u2019s bur\u00ad\nden is great.\u201d Ibid.2\n    Rarely do this Court\u2019s precedents provide clearly estab\u00ad\nlished law so closely on point with the facts of a particular\ncase. Together, Miranda and Butler establish that a court\n\u201cmust presume that a defendant did not waive his\nright[s]\u201d; the prosecution bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in at\u00ad\ntempting to demonstrate waiver; the fact of a \u201clengthy\ninterrogation\u201d prior to obtaining statements is \u201cstrong\nevidence\u201d against a finding of valid waiver; \u201cmere silence\u201d\nin response to questioning is \u201cnot enough\u201d; and waiver\nmay not be presumed \u201csimply from the fact that a confes\u00ad\nsion was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d Miranda, supra, at\n475\u2013476; Butler, supra, at 372\u2013373.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 TheCourt cites Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986), for\nthe proposition that the prosecution\u2019s \u201c \u2018heavy burden\u2019 \u201d under Miranda\n\u201cis not more than the burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.\u201d Ante, at 12. Connelly did reject a clear and convincing\nevidence standard of proof in favor of a preponderance burden. But\nnothing in Connelly displaced the core presumption against finding a\nwaiver of rights, and we have subsequently relied on Miranda\u2019s charac\u00ad\nterization of the prosecution\u2019s burden as \u201cheavy.\u201d See Arizona v.\nRoberson, 486 U. S. 675, 680 (1988).\n   3 Likely reflecting the great weight of the prosecution\u2019s burden in\n\nproving implied waiver, many contemporary police training resources\ninstruct officers to obtain a waiver of rights prior to proceeding at all\nwith an interrogation. See, e.g., F. Inbau, J. Reid, J. Buckley, & B.\nJayne, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 491 (4th ed. 2004)\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  It is undisputed here that Thompkins never expressly\nwaived his right to remain silent. His refusal to sign even\nan acknowledgment that he understood his Miranda\nrights evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those\nrights. Cf. United States v. Plugh, 576 F. 3d 135, 142\n(CA2 2009) (suspect\u2019s refusal to sign waiver-of-rights form\n\u201cconstituted an unequivocally negative answer to the\nquestion . . . whether he was willing to waive his rights\u201d).\nThat Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements\nat issue until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes\nof interrogation serves as \u201cstrong evidence\u201d against\nwaiver. Miranda and Butler expressly preclude the possi\u00ad\nbility that the inculpatory statements themselves are\nsufficient to establish waiver.\n  In these circumstances, Thompkins\u2019 \u201cactions and words\u201d\npreceding the inculpatory statements simply do not evi\u00ad\ndence a \u201ccourse of conduct indicating waiver\u201d sufficient to\ncarry the prosecution\u2019s burden. See Butler, supra, at 373.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(hereinafter Inbau) (\u201cOnce [a] waiver is given, the police may proceed\nwith the interrogation\u201d); D. Zulawski & D.

See, e.g., United States v.\nWallace, 848 F. 2d 1464, 1475 (CA9 1988) (no implied waiver when\nwarned suspect \u201cmaintained her silence for . . . perhap[s] as many as\nten minutes\u201d before answering a question); McDonald v. Lucas, 677\nF. 2d 518, 521\u2013522 (CA5 1982) (no implied waiver when defendant\nrefused to sign waiver and there was \u201cno evidence of words or actions\nimplying a waiver, except the [inculpatory] statement\u201d). Generally,\ncourts have found implied waiver when a warned suspect has made\nincriminating statements \u201cas part of a steady stream of speech or as\npart of a back-and-forth conversation with the police,\u201d or when a\nwarned suspect who previously invoked his right \u201cspontaneously\nrecommences the dialogue with his interviewers.\u201d Bui v.

Indeed,\nMichigan and the United States concede that no waiver\noccurred in this case until Thompkins responded \u201cyes\u201d to\nthe questions about God. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 30. I\nbelieve it is objectively unreasonable under our clearly\nestablished precedents to conclude the prosecution met its\n\u201cheavy burden\u201d of proof on a record consisting of three one\u00ad\nword answers, following 2 hours and 45 minutes of silence\npunctuated by a few largely nonverbal responses to uni\u00ad\ndentified questions.\n                           B\n  Perhaps because our prior Miranda precedents so\nclearly favor Thompkins, the Court today goes beyond\nAEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review and announces a\nnew general principle of law.

Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157\n(1984). Consistent with that rule, we have frequently\ndeclined to address questions beyond what is necessary to\nresolve a case under AEDPA. See, e.g., Tyler v. Cain, 533\nU. S. 656, 667\u2013668 (2001) (declining to address question\nwhere any statement by this Court would be \u201cdictum\u201d in\nlight of AEDPA\u2019s statutory constraints on habeas review);\ncf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (noting that\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), \u201cmade no new\nlaw\u201d because the \u201ccase was before us on habeas review\u201d).\nNo necessity exists to justify the Court\u2019s broad announce\u00ad\nment today.\n   The Court concludes that when Miranda warnings have\nbeen given and understood, \u201can accused\u2019s uncoerced\nstatement establishes an implied waiver of the right to\nremain silent.\u201d Ante, at 12\u201313. More broadly still, the\nCourt states that, \u201c[a]s a general proposition, the law can\npresume that an individual who, with a full understanding\nof his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with\ntheir exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish\nthe protection those rights afford.\u201d Ante, at 13.\n   These principles flatly contradict our longstanding\nviews that \u201ca valid waiver will not be presumed . . . simply\nfrom the fact that a confession was in fact eventually\nobtained,\u201d Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475, and that \u201c[t]he\ncourts must presume that a defendant did not waive his\nrights,\u201d Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. Indeed, we have in the\npast summarily reversed a state-court decision that in\u00ad\nverted Miranda\u2019s antiwaiver presumption, characterizing\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe error as \u201creadily apparent.\u201d Tague, 444 U. S., at 470\u2013\n471. At best, the Court today creates an unworkable and\nconflicting set of presumptions that will undermine\nMiranda\u2019s goal of providing \u201cconcrete constitutional guide\u00ad\nlines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow,\u201d\n384 U. S., at 442. At worst, it overrules sub silentio an\nessential aspect of the protections Miranda has long pro\u00ad\nvided for the constitutional guarantee against self\u00ad\nincrimination.\n   The Court\u2019s conclusion that Thompkins\u2019 inculpatory\nstatements were sufficient to establish an implied waiver,\nante, at 14, finds no support in Butler. Butler itself distin\u00ad\nguished between a sufficient \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d and in\u00ad\nculpatory statements, reiterating Miranda\u2019s admonition\nthat \u201c \u2018a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from . . .\nthe fact that a confession was in fact eventually ob\u00ad\ntained.\u2019 \u201d Butler, supra, at 373 (quoting Miranda, supra,\nat 475). Michigan suggests Butler\u2019s silence \u201c \u2018when ad\u00ad\nvised of his right to the assistance of a lawyer,\u2019 \u201d combined\nwith our remand for the state court to apply the implied\u00ad\nwaiver standard, shows that silence followed by state\u00ad\nments can be a \u201c \u2018course of conduct.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner\n26 (quoting Butler, supra, at 371). But the evidence of\nimplied waiver in Butler was worlds apart from the evi\u00ad\ndence in this case, because Butler unequivocally said \u201cI\nwill talk to you\u201d after having been read Miranda warn\u00ad\nings. Thompkins, of course, made no such statement.\n   The Court also relies heavily on Burbine in characteriz\u00ad\ning the scope of the prosecution\u2019s burden in proving\nwaiver. Consistent with Burbine, the Court observes, the\nprosecution must prove that waiver was \u201c \u2018voluntary in the\nsense that it was the product of a free and deliberate\nchoice rather than intimidation\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018made with a full\nawareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned\nand the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 10 (quoting 475 U.

What it omits, however, is\nthat the prosecution also bears an antecedent burden of\nshowing there was, in fact, either an express waiver or a\n\u201ccourse of conduct\u201d sufficiently clear to support a finding of\nimplied waiver. Nothing in Burbine even hints at remov\u00ad\ning that obligation. The question in that case, rather, was\nwhether a suspect\u2019s multiple express waivers of his rights\nwere invalid because police \u201cmisinformed an inquiring\nattorney about their plans concerning the suspect or be\u00ad\ncause they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney\u2019s\nefforts to reach him.\u201d Id., at 420; see also Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573 (1987). The Court\u2019s analysis in\nBurbine was predicated on the existence of waiver-in-fact.\n  Today\u2019s dilution of the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof to\nthe bare fact that a suspect made inculpatory statements\nafter Miranda warnings were given and understood takes\nan unprecedented step away from the \u201chigh standards of\nproof for the waiver of constitutional rights\u201d this Court has\nlong demanded. Miranda, supra, at 475; cf. Brewer v.\nWilliams, 430 U. S. 387, 404 (1977) (\u201c[C]ourts indulge in\nevery reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d); Zerbst,\n304 U. S., at 464. When waiver is to be inferred during a\ncustodial interrogation, there are sound reasons to require\nevidence beyond inculpatory statements themselves.\nMiranda and our subsequent cases are premised on the\nidea that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.\nSee 384 U. S., at 455 (\u201cEven without employing brutality,\nthe \u2018third degree\u2019 or [other] specific strategems . . . the\nvery fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on\nindividual liberty and trades on the weakness of individu\u00ad\nals\u201d); Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435 (2000).\nRequiring proof of a course of conduct beyond the inculpa\u00ad\ntory statements themselves is critical to ensuring that\nthose statements are voluntary admissions and not the\ndubious product of an overborne will.\n  Today\u2019s decision thus ignores the important interests\n14                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nMiranda safeguards.

Today\u2019s decision bodes poorly for\nthe fundamental principles that Miranda protects.\n                              III\n   Thompkins separately argues that his conduct during\nthe interrogation invoked his right to remain silent, re\u00ad\nquiring police to terminate questioning.

Such a result bears little sem\u00ad\nblance to the \u201cfully effective\u201d prophylaxis, 384 U. S., at\n444, that Miranda requires.\n                              A\n   Thompkins\u2019 claim for relief under AEDPA rests on the\nclearly established federal law of Miranda and Mosley. In\nMiranda, the Court concluded that \u201c[i]f [an] individual\nindicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during\nquestioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interro\u00ad\ngation must cease. . . . [A]ny statement taken after the\nperson invokes his privilege cannot be other than the\nproduct of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.\u201d 384 U. S., at\n473\u2013474. In Mosley, the Court said that a \u201ccritical safe\u00ad\nguard\u201d of the right to remain silent is a suspect\u2019s \u201c \u2018right to\ncut off questioning.\u2019 \u201d 423 U. S., at 103 (quoting Miranda,\nsupra, at 474). Thus, \u201cthe admissibility of statements\nobtained after the person in custody has decided to remain\nsilent depends under Miranda on whether his \u2018right to cut\noff questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d 423 U. S., at\n104.5\n   Thompkins contends that in refusing to respond to\nquestions he effectively invoked his right to remain silent,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 In holding that Mosley\u2019s right had been \u201c \u2018scrupulously honored,\u2019 \u201d\n\nthe Court observed that he was properly advised of his rights and\nindicated his understanding in writing; that police \u201cimmediately\nceased\u201d interrogation when Mosley stated he did not want to discuss\nthe crime and allowed an \u201cinterval of more than two hours\u201d to pass\nbefore reapproaching Mosley \u201cat another location about an unrelated\n[crime]\u201d; and that Mosley was readministered \u201cfull and complete\nMiranda warnings at the outset of the second interrogation\u201d and had a\n\u201cfull and fair opportunity to exercise th[o]se options.\u201d 423 U.

In Michigan\u2019s\nview, Thompkins cannot prevail under AEDPA because\nthis Court\u2019s precedents have not previously established\nwhether a suspect\u2019s ambiguous statements or actions\nrequire the police to stop questioning. We have held that\na suspect who has \u201c \u2018invoked his right to have counsel\npresent . . . is not subject to further interrogation by the\nauthorities until counsel has been made available to him,\nunless [he] initiates further communication, exchanges, or\nconversations with the police.\u2019 \u201d Maryland v. Shatzer, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484\u2013485 (1981)). Notwithstanding\nMiranda\u2019s statement that \u201cthere can be no questioning\u201d if\na suspect \u201cindicates in any manner . . . that he wishes to\nconsult with an attorney,\u201d 384 U. S., at 444\u2013445, the Court\nin Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 461 (1994) estab\u00ad\nlished a clear-statement rule for invoking the right to\ncounsel. After a suspect has knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived his Miranda rights, Davis held, police may con\u00ad\ntinue questioning \u201cuntil and unless the suspect clearly\nrequests an attorney.\u201d 512 U. S., at 461 (emphasis added).\n   Because this Court has never decided whether Davis\u2019\nclear-statement rule applies to an invocation of the right\nto silence, Michigan contends, there was no clearly estab\u00ad\nlished federal law prohibiting the state court from requir\u00ad\ning an unambiguous invocation. That the state court\u2019s\ndecision was not objectively unreasonable is confirmed, in\nMichigan\u2019s view, by the number of federal Courts of Ap\u00ad\npeals to have applied Davis to invocation of the right to\nsilence. Brief for Petitioner 44.\n   Under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, it is\nindeed difficult to conclude that the state court\u2019s applica\u00ad\ntion of our precedents was objectively unreasonable.\nAlthough the duration and consistency of Thompkins\u2019\nrefusal to answer questions throughout the 3-hour inter\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrogation provide substantial evidence in support of his\nclaim, Thompkins did not remain absolutely silent, and\nthis Court has not previously addressed whether a suspect\ncan invoke the right to silence by remaining uncooperative\nand nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes.\n                               B\n   The Court, however, eschews this narrow ground of\ndecision, instead extending Davis to hold that police may\ncontinue questioning a suspect until he unambiguously\ninvokes his right to remain silent. Because Thompkins\nneither said \u201che wanted to remain silent\u201d nor said \u201che did\nnot want to talk with the police,\u201d the Court concludes, he\ndid not clearly invoke his right to silence. Ante, at 8\u201310.6\n   I disagree with this novel application of Davis. Neither\nthe rationale nor holding of that case compels today\u2019s\nresult. Davis involved the right to counsel, not the right to\nsilence. The Court in Davis reasoned that extending\nEdwards\u2019 \u201crigid\u201d prophylactic rule to ambiguous requests\nfor a lawyer would transform Miranda into a \u201c \u2018wholly\nirrational obstacl[e] to legitimate police investigative\nactivity\u2019 \u201d by \u201cneedlessly prevent[ing] the police from ques\u00ad\ntioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if [he] did\nnot wish to have a lawyer present.\u201d Davis, supra, at 460.\nBut Miranda itself \u201cdistinguished between the procedural\nsafeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a\nrequest for an attorney.\u201d Mosley, supra, at 104, n. 10;\naccord, Edwards, supra, at 485. Mosley upheld the admis\u00ad\nsion of statements when police immediately stopped inter\u00ad\nrogating a suspect who invoked his right to silence, but\nreapproached him after a 2-hour delay and obtained in\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court also ignores a second available avenue to avoid reaching\n\nthe constitutional question. Because the Sixth Circuit declined to\ndecide Thompkins\u2019 invocation claim, a remand would permit the lower\ncourt to address the question in the first instance. Cf. Cutter v. Wilkin\nson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).\n18                   BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nculpatory responses relating to a different crime after\nadministering fresh Miranda warnings. The different\neffects of invoking the rights are consistent with distinct\nstandards for invocation. To the extent Mosley contem\u00ad\nplates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than Edwards\u2014\nand, in particular, does not categorically bar police from\nreapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to\nremain silent\u2014Davis\u2019 concern about \u201c \u2018wholly irrational\nobstacles\u2019 \u201d to police investigation applies with less force.\n   In addition, the suspect\u2019s equivocal reference to a lawyer\nin Davis occurred only after he had given express oral and\nwritten waivers of his rights. Davis\u2019 holding is explicitly\npredicated on that fact. See 512 U. S., at 461 (\u201cWe there\u00ad\nfore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the\nMiranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue\nquestioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests\nan attorney\u201d). The Court ignores this aspect of Davis, as\nwell as the decisions of numerous federal and state courts\ndeclining to apply a clear-statement rule when a suspect\nhas not previously given an express waiver of rights.7\n   In my mind, a more appropriate standard for addressing\na suspect\u2019s ambiguous invocation of the right to remain\nsilent is the constraint Mosley places on questioning a\nsuspect who has invoked that right: The suspect\u2019s \u201c \u2018right\nto cut off questioning\u2019 \u201d must be \u201c \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d\nSee 423 U.

Under such\ncircumstances, \u201cscrupulous\u201d respect for the suspect\u2019s\nrights will require police to terminate questioning under\nMosley.8\n   To be sure, such a standard does not provide police with\na bright-line rule. Cf. ante, at 9\u201310. But, as we have\npreviously recognized, Mosley itself does not offer clear\nguidance to police about when and how interrogation may\ncontinue after a suspect invokes his rights. See Solem v.\nStumes, 465 U. S. 638, 648 (1984); see also Shatzer, 559\nU. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concur\u00ad\nring in judgment) (slip op., at 3). Given that police have\nfor nearly 35 years applied Mosley\u2019s fact-specific standard\nin questioning suspects who have invoked their right to\nremain silent; that our cases did not during that time\nresolve what statements or actions suffice to invoke that\nright; and that neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General\nhave provided evidence in this case that the status quo\nhas proved unworkable, I see little reason to believe to\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Indeed, this rule appears to reflect widespread contemporary police\npractice. Thompkins\u2019 amici collect a range of training materials that\ninstruct police not to engage in prolonged interrogation after a suspect\nhas failed to respond to initial questioning. See NACDL Brief 32\u201334.\nOne widely used police manual, for example, teaches that a suspect\nwho \u201cindicates,\u201d \u201ceven by silence itself,\u201d his unwillingness to answer\nquestions \u201chas obviously exercised his constitutional privilege against\nself-incrimination.\u201d Inbau 498.\n20                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nday\u2019s clear-statement rule is necessary to ensure effective\nlaw enforcement.\n   Davis\u2019 clear-statement rule is also a poor fit for the right\nto silence. Advising a suspect that he has a \u201cright to\nremain silent\u201d is unlikely to convey that he must speak\n(and must do so in some particular fashion) to ensure the\nright will be protected. Cf. Soffar v. Cockrell, 300 F. 3d\n588, 603 (CA5 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cWhat in the world must an individual do to exercise his\nconstitutional right to remain silent beyond actually, in\nfact, remaining silent?\u201d). By contrast, telling a suspect \u201che\nhas the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\ncannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him\nprior to any questioning if he so desires,\u201d Miranda, 384\nU. S., at 479, implies the need for speech to exercise that\nright. Davis\u2019 requirement that a suspect must \u201cclearly\nreques[t] an attorney\u201d to terminate questioning thus\naligns with a suspect\u2019s likely understanding of the\nMiranda warnings in a way today\u2019s rule does not. The\nCourt suggests Thompkins could have employed the \u201csim\u00ad\nple, unambiguous\u201d means of saying \u201che wanted to remain\nsilent\u201d or \u201cdid not want to talk with the police.\u201d Ante, at\n10. But the Miranda warnings give no hint that a suspect\nshould use those magic words, and there is little reason to\nbelieve police\u2014who have ample incentives to avoid invoca\u00ad\ntion\u2014will provide such guidance.\n   Conversely, the Court\u2019s concern that police will face\n\u201cdifficult decisions about an accused\u2019s unclear intent\u201d and\nsuffer the consequences of \u201c \u2018guess[ing] wrong,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 9\u2013\n10 (quoting Davis, 512 U. S., at 461), is misplaced. If a\nsuspect makes an ambiguous statement or engages in\nconduct that creates uncertainty about his intent to invoke\nhis right, police can simply ask for clarification. See id., at\n467 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). It is hardly an\nunreasonable burden for police to ask a suspect, for in\u00ad\nstance, \u201cDo you want to talk to us?\u201d The majority in Davis\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Given this straight\u00ad\nforward mechanism by which police can \u201cscrupulously\nhono[r]\u201d a suspect\u2019s right to silence, today\u2019s clear\u00ad\nstatement rule can only be seen as accepting \u201cas tolerable\nthe certainty that some poorly expressed requests [to\nremain silent] will be disregarded,\u201d id., at 471 (opinion of\nSouter, J.), without any countervailing benefit. Police may\nwell prefer not to seek clarification of an ambiguous\nstatement out of fear that a suspect will invoke his rights.\nBut \u201cour system of justice is not founded on a fear that a\nsuspect will exercise his rights. \u2018If the exercise of constitu\u00ad\ntional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of\nlaw enforcement, then there is something very wrong with\nthat system.\u2019 \u201d Burbine, 475 U. S., at 458 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478,\n490 (1964)).\n   The Court asserts in passing that treating ambiguous\nstatements or acts as an invocation of the right to silence\nwill only \u201c \u2018marginally\u2019 \u201d serve Miranda\u2019s goals. Ante, at\n10. Experience suggests the contrary. In the 16 years\nsince Davis was decided, ample evidence has accrued that\ncriminal suspects often use equivocal or colloquial lan\u00ad\nguage in attempting to invoke their right to silence. A\nnumber of lower courts that have (erroneously, in my\nview) imposed a clear-statement requirement for invoca\u00ad\ntion of the right to silence have rejected as ambiguous an\narray of statements whose meaning might otherwise be\nthought plain.9 At a minimum, these decisions suggest\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 See United States v.

Even if some of the cited\ndecisions are themselves in tension with Davis\u2019 admoni\u00ad\ntion that a suspect need not \u201c \u2018speak with the discrimina\u00ad\ntion of an Oxford don\u2019 \u201d to invoke his rights, 512 U. S., at\n459 (quoting id., at 476 (opinion of Souter, J.)), they dem\u00ad\nonstrate that today\u2019s decision will significantly burden the\nexercise of the right to silence. Notably, when a suspect\n\u201cunderstands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored\n. . . in contravention of the \u2018rights\u2019 just read to him by his\ninterrogator, he may well see further objection as futile\nand confession (true or not) as the only way to end his\ninterrogation.\u201d Id., at 472\u2013473.\n    For these reasons, I believe a precautionary require\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nremain silent); State v.

THOMPKINS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u20131470. Argued March 1, 2010\u2014Decided June 1, 2010\nAfter advising respondent Thompkins of his rights, in full compliance\n  with Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, Detective Helgert and an\n  other Michigan officer interrogated him about a shooting in which\n  one victim died. At no point did Thompkins say that he wanted to\n  remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he\n  wanted an attorney. He was largely silent during the 3-hour interro\n  gation, but near the end, he answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if he prayed\n  to God to forgive him for the shooting. He moved to suppress his\n  statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right\n  to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his in\n  culpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied the\n  motion. At trial on first-degree murder and other charges, the prose\n  cution called Eric Purifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins\n  and a third accomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and\n  who had been convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder\n  and assault. Thompkins\u2019 defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.\n  Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots. During clos\n  ing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not\n  seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoy\u2019s jury had made the\n  right decision. Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the\n  jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial\n  only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins\u2019 guilt. The\n  jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison\n  without parole. In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court\n  rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim\n  for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Puri\n  foy\u2019s trial. On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both\n  Thompkins\u2019 Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims. The Fed\n2                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    eral District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning\n    that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\n    coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it\n    was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective\n    Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), for\n    the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right\n    to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state\n    court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins\u2019\n    right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of\n    counsel claim.\nHeld:\n    1. The state court\u2019s decision rejecting Thompkins\u2019 Miranda claim\n was correct under de novo review and therefore necessarily reason\n able under AEDPA\u2019s more deferential standard of review. Pp. 7\u201317.\n       (a) Thompkins\u2019 silence during the interrogation did not invoke\n his right to remain silent. A suspect\u2019s Miranda right to counsel must\n be invoked \u201cunambiguously.\u201d Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,\n 459. If the accused makes an \u201cambiguous or equivocal\u201d statement or\n no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation,\n ibid., or ask questions to clarify the accused\u2019s intent, id., at 461\u2013462.\n There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for deter\n mining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain si\n lent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis. Both protect\n the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an\n interrogation to cease when either right is invoked. The unambigu\n ous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that\n \u201cavoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to officers\u201d\n on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis, supra, at 458\u2013459.\n Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did\n not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the question\n ing. He did neither. Pp. 8\u201310.\n       (b) Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he know\n ingly and voluntarily made a statement to police. A waiver must be\n \u201cthe product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,\n coercion, or deception\u201d and \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the\n nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the de\n cision to abandon it.\u201d Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 421. Such a\n waiver may be \u201cimplied\u201d through a \u201cdefendant\u2019s silence, coupled with\n an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating\n waiver.\u201d North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373. If the State\n establishes that a Miranda warning was given and that it was un\n derstood by the accused, an accused\u2019s uncoerced statement estab\n lishes an implied waiver. The record here shows that Thompkins\n waived his right to remain silent. First, the lack of any contention\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthat he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he\ngave up when he spoke. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Second, his an\nswer to the question about God is a \u201ccourse of conduct indicating\nwaiver\u201d of that right. Butler, supra, at 373. Had he wanted to re\nmain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambigu\nously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the interrogation. That he\nmade a statement nearly three hours after receiving a Miranda\nwarning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of\nconduct indicating waiver. Third, there is no evidence that his\nstatement was coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. He does not\nclaim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.\nThe interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle\nof the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour\ninterrogation is inherently coercive. Cf. Colorado v. Connelly, 479\nU. S. 157, 163\u2013164, n. 1. The fact that the question referred to reli\ngious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary. Id., at\n170. Pp. 10\u201315.\n      (c) Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could\nconstitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not\nallowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver. However,\na rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with\nButler\u2019s holding that courts can infer a waiver \u201cfrom the actions and\nwords of the person interrogated.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. Any waiver, ex\npress or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time,\nterminating further interrogation. When the suspect knows that\nMiranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his\nor her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation pro\ngresses. After giving a Miranda warning, police may interrogate a\nsuspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights. Thus,\nthe police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins\u2019\nMiranda rights before interrogating him. Pp. 15\u201317.\n   2. Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins\ncannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record. To es\ntablish ineffective assistance, a defendant \u201cmust show both deficient\nperformance and prejudice.\u201d Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___,\n___. To establish prejudice, a \u201cdefendant must show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668, 694, considering \u201cthe totality of the evi\ndence before the judge or jury,\u201d id., at 695. Here, the Sixth Circuit\ndid not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.\nThe state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence\nof Purifoy\u2019s earlier conviction. Even if it used an incorrect legal stan\ndard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPA\u2019s deferential\n4                      BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show preju\n    dice under de novo review, a more favorable standard for him. De\n    novo review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will\n    not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on de novo re\n    view. See \u00a72254(a). Assuming that failure to request a limiting in\n    struction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show\n    prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that\n    such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other\n    evidence of guilt. The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the\n    shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance cam\n    era photograph. A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him,\n    and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that\n    Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting. The\n    jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy\u2019s credibility, as it\n    was instructed to do.

VAN \n\n           CHESTER THOMPKINS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir\ncuit, in a habeas corpus proceeding challenging a Michi\ngan conviction for first-degree murder and certain other\noffenses, ruled that there had been two separate constitu\ntional errors in the trial that led to the jury\u2019s guilty ver\ndict. First, the Court of Appeals determined that a state\nment by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution,\nhad been elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU. S. 436 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for\nan instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice\nwas ineffective assistance by defense counsel. See Strick\nland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Both of these\ncontentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in\nthe habeas corpus proceedings before the United States\nDistrict Court. Certiorari was granted to review the deci\nsion by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden\nof a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here,\nand Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the\nrespondent.\n2                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall\nin Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims was Samuel\nMorris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The\nother victim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries\nand later testified. Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled.\nAbout one year later he was found in Ohio and arrested\nthere.\n  Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to inter\nrogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan.\nThe interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted\nabout three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a\nroom that was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair\nthat resembled a school desk (it had an arm on it that\nswings around to provide a surface to write on). App.\n144a\u2013145a. At the beginning of the interrogation, one of\nthe officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins with\na form derived from the Miranda rule. It stated:\n     \u201cNOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n                       AND STATEMENT\n    \u201c1. You have the right to remain silent.\n    \u201c2. Anything you say can and will be used against\n    you in a court of law.\n    \u201c3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before an\n    swering any questions and you have the right to have\n    a lawyer present with you while you are answering\n    any questions.\n    \u201c4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be\n    appointed to represent you before any questioning, if\n    you wish one.\n    \u201c5. You have the right to decide at any time before or\n    during questioning to use your right to remain silent\n    and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are be\n    ing questioned.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 60 (some capi\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    talization omitted).\n   Helgert asked Thompkins to read the fifth warning out\nloud. App. 8a. Thompkins complied. Helgert later said\nthis was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and Hel\ngert concluded that Thompkins understood English. Id.,\nat 9a. Helgert then read the other four Miranda warnings\nout loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demon\nstrate that he understood his rights. App. 8a\u20139a. Thomp\nkins declined to sign the form. The record contains con\nflicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally\nconfirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.\nCompare id., at 9a (at a suppression hearing, Helgert\ntestified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that he un\nderstood his rights), with id., at 148a (at trial, Helgert\nstated, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I orally asked him\u201d whether\nThompkins understood his rights).\n   Officers began an interrogation. At no point during the\ninterrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to re\nmain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or\nthat he wanted an attorney. Id., at 10a. Thompkins was\n\u201c[l]argely\u201d silent during the interrogation, which lasted\nabout three hours. Id., at 19a. He did give a few limited\nverbal responses, however, such as \u201cyeah,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow.\u201d And on occasion he communicated by nodding his\nhead. Id., at 23a. Thompkins also said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t\nwant a peppermint\u201d that was offered to him by the police\nand that the chair he was \u201csitting in was hard.\u201d Id., at\n152a.\n   About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation,\nHelgert asked Thompkins, \u201cDo you believe in God?\u201d Id., at\n11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and\nsaid \u201cYes,\u201d as his eyes \u201cwell[ed] up with tears.\u201d Id., at 11a.\nHelgert asked, \u201cDo you pray to God?\u201d Thompkins said\n\u201cYes.\u201d Id., at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, \u201cDo you pray to\nGod to forgive you for shooting that boy down?\u201d Id., at\n4                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n153a. Thompkins answered \u201cYes\u201d and looked away. Ibid.\nThompkins refused to make a written confession, and the\ninterrogation ended about 15 minutes later. Id., at 11a.\n  Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder,\nassault with intent to commit murder, and certain fire\narms-related offenses. He moved to suppress the state\nments made during the interrogation. He argued that he\nhad invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,\nrequiring police to end the interrogation at once, see\nMichigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 103 (1975) (citing\nMiranda, 384 U. S., at 474), that he had not waived his\nright to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements\nwere involuntary. The trial court denied the motion.\n  At trial, the prosecution\u2019s theory was that Thompkins\nshot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven\nby Eric Purifoy. Purifoy testified that he had been driving\nthe van and that Thompkins was in the passenger seat\nwhile another man, one Myzell Woodward, was in the\nback. The defense strategy was to pin the blame on Puri\nfoy. Purifoy testified he did not see who fired the weapon\nbecause the van was stopped and he was bending over\nnear the floor when shots were fired. Purifoy explained\nthat, just after the shooting, Thompkins, holding a pistol,\ntold Purifoy, \u201cWhat the hell you doing? Pull off.\u201d Purifoy\nthen drove away from the scene. App. 170a.\n  So that the Thompkins jury could assess Purifoy\u2019s credi\nbility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited testimony\nfrom Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the shoot\ning under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Purifoy and\nDetective Helgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the\nmurder and assault charges, convicted him of carrying a\nconcealed weapon in a motor vehicle, and hung on two\nother firearms offenses to which he later pleaded guilty.\nAt Purifoy\u2019s trial, the prosecution had argued that Purifoy\nwas the driver and Thompkins was the shooter. This was\nconsistent with the prosecution\u2019s argument at Thomp\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nkins\u2019s trial.\n   After Purifoy\u2019s trial had ended\u2014but before Thompkins\u2019s\ntrial began\u2014Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters. The\nletters expressed Purifoy\u2019s disappointment that Thomp\nkins\u2019s family thought Purifoy was a \u201csnitch\u201d and a \u201crat.\u201d\nId., at 179a\u2013180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a\ncopy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that\nPurifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the\nshooting. Id., at 180a. The letters also contained state\nments by Purifoy that claimed they were both innocent.\nId., at 178a\u2013179a. At Thompkins\u2019s trial, the prosecution\nsuggested that one of Purifoy\u2019s letters appeared to give\nThompkins a trial strategy. It was, the prosecution sug\ngested, that Woodward shot the victims, allowing Purifoy\nand Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the\nshooting started. Id., at 187a\u2013189a.\n   During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested\nthat Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see\nThompkins shoot the victims:\n    \u201cDid Eric Purifoy\u2019s Jury make the right decision? I\u2019m\n    not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his\n    Jury found. Take his testimony for what it was, [a]\n    twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but\n    his tight buddy.\u201d Id., at 202a.\nDefense counsel did not object. Defense counsel also did\nnot ask for an instruction informing the jury that it could\nconsider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial only to\nassess Purifoy\u2019s credibility, not to establish Thompkins\u2019s\nguilt.\n  The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts. He was\nsentenced to life in prison without parole.\n                           B\n  The trial court denied a motion for new trial filed by\nThompkins\u2019s appellate counsel. The trial court rejected\n6                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for fail\nure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome\nof Purifoy\u2019s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice\nThompkins. Id., at 236a.\n   Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial\ncourt\u2019s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under\nMiranda. The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the\nMiranda claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked\nhis right to remain silent and had waived it. It also re\njected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding\nthat Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy\u2019s\nconviction for firearms offenses resulted in prejudice.

W. 2d\n676 (2004) (table).\n   Thompkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan.      The District Court rejected Thompkins\u2019s\nMiranda and ineffective-assistance claims. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 39a\u201372a. It noted that, under the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a fed\neral court cannot grant a petition for a writ of habeas\ncorpus unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of the merits\nwas \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\nof, clearly established Federal law.\u201d           28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). The District Court reasoned that Thompkins\ndid not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\ncoerced into making statements during the interrogation.\nIt held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not\nunreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nreversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his Miranda and\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547 F. 3d 572\n(2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in\nrejecting Thompkins\u2019s Miranda claim, unreasonably ap\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplied clearly established federal law and based its decision\non an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged\nthat a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be\nexpress, as it can be \u201c \u2018inferred from the actions and words\nof the person interrogated.\u2019 \u201d 547 F. 3d, at 582 (quoting\nNorth Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979)). The\npanel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unrea\nsonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances\nhere. The Court of Appeals found that the state court\nunreasonably determined the facts because \u201cthe evidence\ndemonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours\nand forty-five minutes.\u201d 547 F. 3d, at 586. According to\nthe Court of Appeals, Thompkins\u2019s \u201cpersistent silence for\nnearly three hours in response to questioning and re\npeated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a\nclear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins\ndid not wish to waive his rights.\u201d Id., at 588.\n  The Court of Appeals next determined that the state\ncourt unreasonably applied clearly established federal law\nby rejecting Thompkins\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim based on counsel\u2019s failure to ask for a limiting in\nstruction regarding Purifoy\u2019s acquittal. The Court of\nAppeals asserted that because Thompkins\u2019s central strat\negy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reason\nable probability that the result of Thompkins\u2019s trial would\nhave been different if there had been a limiting instruction\nregarding Purifoy\u2019s acquittal.\n  We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            II\n  Under AEDPA, a federal court may not grant a habeas\ncorpus application \u201cwith respect to any claim that was\nadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d), unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\n8                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the\nSupreme Court of the United States,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), or \u201cwas\nbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in\nlight of the evidence presented in the State court proceed\ning,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2). See Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1). The relevant state-court\ndecision here is the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\naffirming Thompkins\u2019s conviction and rejecting his\nMiranda and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on\nthe merits.\n                            III\n  The Miranda Court formulated a warning that must be\ngiven to suspects before they can be subjected to custodial\ninterrogation. The substance of the warning still must be\ngiven to suspects today. A suspect in custody must be\nadvised as follows:\n    \u201cHe must be warned prior to any questioning that he\n    has the right to remain silent, that anything he says\n    can be used against him in a court of law, that he has\n    the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\n    cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for\n    him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d 384\n    U. S., at 479.\nAll concede that the warning given in this case was in full\ncompliance with these requirements. The dispute centers\non the response\u2014or nonresponse\u2014from the suspect.\n                             A\n   Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers\nto questions from the detectives were inadmissible. He\nfirst contends that he \u201cinvoke[d] his privilege\u201d to remain\nsilent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of\ntime, so the interrogation should have \u201ccease[d]\u201d before he\nmade his inculpatory statements. Id., at 474; see Mosley,\n423 U. S., at 103 (police must \u201c \u2018scrupulously hono[r]\u2019 \u201d this\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201ccritical safeguard\u201d when the accused invokes his or her\n\u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 \u201d (quoting Miranda, supra, at\n474, 479)).\n    This argument is unpersuasive. In the context of invok\ning the Miranda right to counsel, the Court in Davis v.\nUnited States, 512 U. S. 452, 459 (1994), held that a sus\npect must do so \u201cunambiguously.\u201d If an accused makes a\nstatement concerning the right to counsel \u201cthat is ambigu\nous or equivocal\u201d or makes no statement, the police are not\nrequired to end the interrogation, ibid., or ask questions to\nclarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her\nMiranda rights, 512 U. S., at 461\u2013462.\n    The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of\nthe right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal,\nbut there is no principled reason to adopt different stan\ndards for determining when an accused has invoked the\nMiranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to\ncounsel at issue in Davis. See, e.g., Solem v. Stumes, 465\nU. S. 638, 648 (1984) (\u201c[M]uch of the logic and language of\n[Mosley],\u201d which discussed the Miranda right to remain\nsilent, \u201ccould be applied to the invocation of the [Miranda\nright to counsel]\u201d). Both protect the privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination, Miranda, supra, at 467\u2013\n473, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either\nright is invoked, Mosley, supra, at 103 (citing Miranda,\nsupra, at 474); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707, 719\n(1979).\n    There is good reason to require an accused who wants to\ninvoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambigu\nously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of\nMiranda rights results in an objective inquiry that\n\u201cavoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to\nofficers\u201d on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis,\n512 U. S., at 458\u2013459. If an ambiguous act, omission, or\nstatement could require police to end the interrogation,\npolice would be required to make difficult decisions about\n10                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nan accused\u2019s unclear intent and face the consequence of\nsuppression \u201cif they guess wrong.\u201d Id., at 461. Suppres\nsion of a voluntary confession in these circumstances\nwould place a significant burden on society\u2019s interest in\nprosecuting criminal activity. See id., at 459\u2013461; Moran\nv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 427 (1986). Treating an am\nbiguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an\ninvocation of Miranda rights \u201cmight add marginally to\nMiranda\u2019s goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in\ncustodial interrogation.\u201d Burbine, 475 U. S., at 425. But\n\u201cas Miranda holds, full comprehension of the rights to\nremain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to\ndispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation\nprocess.\u201d Id., at 427; see Davis, supra, at 460.\n  Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent\nor that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he\nmade either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he\nwould have invoked his \u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning.\u2019 \u201d\nMosley, supra, at 103 (quoting Miranda, supra, at 474).\nHere he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to re\nmain silent.\n                              B\n   We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right\nto remain silent. Even absent the accused\u2019s invocation of\nthe right to remain silent, the accused\u2019s statement during\na custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the\nprosecution can establish that the accused \u201cin fact know\ningly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights\u201d when\nmaking the statement. Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. The\nwaiver inquiry \u201chas two distinct dimensions\u201d: waiver must\nbe \u201cvoluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free\nand deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion,\nor deception,\u201d and \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the\nnature of the right being abandoned and the consequences\nof the decision to abandon it.\u201d Burbine, supra, at 421.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Some language in Miranda could be read to indicate\nthat waivers are difficult to establish absent an explicit\nwritten waiver or a formal, express oral statement.\nMiranda said \u201ca valid waiver will not be presumed simply\nfrom the silence of the accused after warnings are given or\nsimply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventu\nally obtained.\u201d 384 U. S., at 475; see id., at 470 (\u201cNo effec\ntive waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically made\nafter the [Miranda] warnings . . . have been given\u201d). In\naddition, the Miranda Court stated that \u201ca heavy burden\nrests on the government to demonstrate that the defen\ndant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination and his right to retained or\nappointed counsel.\u201d Id., at 475.\n   The course of decisions since Miranda, informed by the\napplication of Miranda warnings in the whole course of\nlaw enforcement, demonstrates that waivers can be estab\nlished even absent formal or express statements of waiver\nthat would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to de\ntermine if a guilty plea has been properly entered. Cf.\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11. The main purpose of Miranda is\nto ensure that an accused is advised of and understands\nthe right to remain silent and the right to counsel. See\nDavis, supra, at 460; Burbine, supra, at 427. Thus, \u201c[i]f\nanything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact\nof the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while\nreaffirming the decision\u2019s core ruling that unwarned\nstatements may not be used as evidence in the prosecu\ntion\u2019s case in chief.\u201d Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S.\n428, 443\u2013444 (2000).\n   One of the first cases to decide the meaning and import\nof Miranda with respect to the question of waiver was\nNorth Carolina v. Butler. The Butler Court, after discuss\ning some of the problems created by the language in\nMiranda, established certain important propositions.\nButler interpreted the Miranda language concerning the\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cheavy burden\u201d to show waiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in ac\ncord with usual principles of determining waiver, which\ncan include waiver implied from all the circumstances.\nSee Butler, supra, at 373, 376. And in a later case, the\nCourt stated that this \u201cheavy burden\u201d is not more than the\nburden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S. 157, 168 (1986).\n  The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a\nwaiver of Miranda rights was express. An \u201cimplicit\nwaiver\u201d of the \u201cright to remain silent\u201d is sufficient to admit\na suspect\u2019s statement into evidence. Butler, supra, at 376.\nButler made clear that a waiver of Miranda rights may be\nimplied through \u201cthe defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an\nunderstanding of his rights and a course of conduct indi\ncating waiver.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. The Court in Butler\ntherefore \u201cretreated\u201d from the \u201clanguage and tenor of the\nMiranda opinion,\u201d which \u201csuggested that the Court would\nrequire that a waiver . . . be \u2018specifically made.\u2019 \u201d Con\nnecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 531\u2013532 (1987) (Bren\nnan, J., concurring in judgment).\n  If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was\ngiven and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this\nshowing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate \u201ca\nvalid waiver\u201d of Miranda rights. Miranda, supra, at 475.\nThe prosecution must make the additional showing that\nthe accused understood these rights. See Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573\u2013575 (1987); Barrett, supra, at\n530; Burbine, supra, at 421\u2013422. Cf. Tague v. Louisiana,\n444 U. S. 469, 469, 471 (1980) (per curiam) (no evidence\nthat accused understood his Miranda rights); Carnley v.\nCochran, 369 U. S. 506, 516 (1962) (government could not\nshow that accused \u201cunderstandingly\u201d waived his right to\ncounsel in light of \u201csilent record\u201d). Where the prosecution\nshows that a Miranda warning was given and that it was\nunderstood by the accused, an accused\u2019s uncoerced state\nment establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsilent.\n   Although Miranda imposes on the police a rule that is\nboth formalistic and practical when it prevents them from\ninterrogating suspects without first providing them with a\nMiranda warning, see Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427, it does\nnot impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect\nmust follow to relinquish those rights. As a general\nproposition, the law can presume that an individual who,\nwith a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a\nmanner inconsistent with their exercise has made a delib\nerate choice to relinquish the protection those rights af\nford. See, e.g., Butler, supra, at 372\u2013376; Connelly, supra,\nat 169\u2013170 (\u201cThere is obviously no reason to require more\nin the way of a \u2018voluntariness\u2019 inquiry in the Miranda\nwaiver context than in the [due process] confession con\ntext\u201d). The Court\u2019s cases have recognized that a waiver of\nMiranda rights need only meet the standard of Johnson v.\nZerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938). See Butler, supra, at\n374\u2013375; Miranda, supra, at 475\u2013476 (applying Zerbst\nstandard of intentional relinquishment of a known right).\nAs Butler recognized, 441 U. S., at 375\u2013376, Miranda\nrights can therefore be waived through means less formal\nthan a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and\nnecessities of interrogation and the fact that Miranda\u2019s\nmain protection lies in advising defendants of their rights,\nsee Davis, 512 U. S., at 460; Burbine, 475 U. S., at 427.\n   The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived\nhis right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case to\nconclude that he did not understand his rights; and on\nthese facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on\nthose rights when he did speak. First, there is no conten\ntion that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and\nfrom this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he\nspoke. See id., at 421. There was more than enough\nevidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins under\n14               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstood his Miranda rights. Thompkins received a written\ncopy of the Miranda warnings; Detective Helgert deter\nmined that Thompkins could read and understand Eng\nlish; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings.\nThompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning,\nwhich stated that \u201cyou have the right to decide at any time\nbefore or during questioning to use your right to remain\nsilent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are\nbeing questioned.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 60 (capitalization\nomitted). He was thus aware that his right to remain\nsilent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time\nand that police would have to honor his right to be silent\nand his right to counsel during the whole course of inter\nrogation. Those rights, the warning made clear, could be\nasserted at any time. Helgert, moreover, read the warn\nings aloud.\n   Second, Thompkins\u2019s answer to Detective Helgert\u2019s\nquestion about whether Thompkins prayed to God for\nforgiveness for shooting the victim is a \u201ccourse of conduct\nindicating waiver\u201d of the right to remain silent. Butler,\nsupra, at 373. If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he\ncould have said nothing in response to Helgert\u2019s questions,\nor he could have unambiguously invoked his Miranda\nrights and ended the interrogation. The fact that Thomp\nkins made a statement about three hours after receiving a\nMiranda warning does not overcome the fact that he\nengaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. Police\nare not required to rewarn suspects from time to time.\nThompkins\u2019s answer to Helgert\u2019s question about praying\nto God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was suffi\ncient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver. This\nis confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins\nhad given sporadic answers to questions throughout the\ninterrogation.\n   Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins\u2019s statement\nwas coerced. See Burbine, supra, at 421. Thompkins does\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot claim that police threatened or injured him during the\ninterrogation or that he was in any way fearful. The\ninterrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in\nthe middle of the afternoon. It is true that apparently he\nwas in a straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is\nno authority for the proposition that an interrogation of\nthis length is inherently coercive. Indeed, even where\ninterrogations of greater duration were held to be im\nproper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by\nother facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated\nand sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and\nthreats. Cf. Connelly, 479 U. S., at 163\u2013164, n. 1. The fact\nthat Helgert\u2019s question referred to Thompkins\u2019s religious\nbeliefs also did not render Thompkins\u2019s statement invol\nuntary. \u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not con\ncerned \u2018with moral and psychological pressures to confess\nemanating from sources other than official coercion.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 170 (quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 305\n(1985)). In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly\nand voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived\nhis right to remain silent.\n                             C\n  Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to\nDetective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to\nremain silent, the police were not allowed to question him\nuntil they obtained a waiver first. Butler forecloses this\nargument. The Butler Court held that courts can infer a\nwaiver of Miranda rights \u201cfrom the actions and words of\nthe person interrogated.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. This principle\nwould be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at\nthe outset. The Butler Court thus rejected the rule pro\nposed by the Butler dissent, which would have \u201crequir[ed]\nthe police to obtain an express waiver of [Miranda rights]\nbefore proceeding with interrogation.\u201d Id., at 379 (Bren\nnan, J., dissenting). This holding also makes sense given\n16               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat \u201cthe primary protection afforded suspects subject[ed]\nto custodial interrogation is the Miranda warnings them\nselves.\u201d Davis, 512 U. S., at 460. The Miranda rule and\nits requirements are met if a suspect receives adequate\nMiranda warnings, understands them, and has an oppor\ntunity to invoke the rights before giving any answers or\nadmissions. Any waiver, express or implied, may be con\ntradicted by an invocation at any time. If the right to\ncounsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any\npoint during questioning, further interrogation must\ncease.\n   Interrogation provides the suspect with additional\ninformation that can put his or her decision to waive, or\nnot to invoke, into perspective. As questioning commences\nand then continues, the suspect has the opportunity to\nconsider the choices he or she faces and to make a more\ninformed decision, either to insist on silence or to cooper\nate. When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be\ninvoked at any time, he or she has the opportunity to\nreassess his or her immediate and long-term interests.\nCooperation with the police may result in more favorable\ntreatment for the suspect; the apprehension of accom\nplices; the prevention of continuing injury and fear; begin\nning steps towards relief or solace for the victims; and the\nbeginning of the suspect\u2019s own return to the law and the\nsocial order it seeks to protect.\n   In order for an accused\u2019s statement to be admissible at\ntrial, police must have given the accused a Miranda warn\ning. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 471. If that condition is\nestablished, the court can proceed to consider whether\nthere has been an express or implied waiver of Miranda\nrights. Id., at 476. In making its ruling on the admissibil\nity of a statement made during custodial questioning, the\ntrial court, of course, considers whether there is evidence\nto support the conclusion that, from the whole course of\nquestioning, an express or implied waiver has been estab\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlished. Thus, after giving a Miranda warning, police may\ninterrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived\nhis or her Miranda rights. On these premises, it fol-\nlows the police were not required to obtain a waiver of\nThompkins\u2019s Miranda rights before commencing the\ninterrogation.\n                             D\n   In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the\nMiranda warnings, and has not invoked his Miranda\nrights, waives the right to remain silent by making an\nuncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not\ninvoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning.\nUnderstanding his rights in full, he waived his right to\nremain silent by making a voluntary statement to the\npolice. The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a\nwaiver of Thompkins\u2019s right to remain silent before inter\nrogating him. The state court\u2019s decision rejecting Thomp\nkins\u2019s Miranda claim was thus correct under de novo\nreview and therefore necessarily reasonable under the\nmore deferential AEDPA standard of review, 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d). See Knowles, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11)\n(state court\u2019s decision was correct under de novo review\nand not unreasonable under AEDPA).\n                             IV\n  The second issue in this case is whether Thompkins\u2019s\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to re\nquest a limiting instruction regarding how the jury could\nconsider the outcome of Purifoy\u2019s trial. To establish inef\nfective assistance of counsel, a defendant \u201cmust show both\ndeficient performance and prejudice.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (citing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 687). To establish\nprejudice, a \u201cdefendant must show that there is a reason\nable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been dif\n18               BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nferent.\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. In assessing preju\ndice, courts \u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence\nbefore the judge or jury.\u201d Id., at 695. The Court of Ap\npeals, however, neglected to take into account the other\nevidence presented against Thompkins.\n   The Court of Appeals determined that the state court\nwas unreasonable, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d), when it found that\nThompkins suffered no prejudice from failure of defense\ncounsel to request an instruction regarding Purifoy\u2019s\nearlier acquittal of the murder and assault charges. The\nstate court had rejected Thompkins\u2019s claim that he was\nprejudiced by evidence of Purifoy\u2019s earlier conviction for\nfirearms offenses, noting that \u201cthe record does not disclose\nan attempt to argue that conviction for an improper pur\npose.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a. It is unclear what preju\ndice standard the state court applied. The Court of Ap\npeals ruled that the state court used the incorrect\nstandard for assessing prejudice under Strickland because\n\u201c[q]uestions of the prosecution\u2019s purpose or intent are\ncompletely irrelevant in analyzing whether an error re\nsulted in prejudice, which by definition concerns the er\nror\u2019s effect upon the outcome.\u201d 547 F. 3d, at 591\u2013592\n(emphasis deleted).\n   Even if the state court used an incorrect legal standard,\nwe need not determine whether AEDPA\u2019s deferential\nstandard of review, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d), applies in this\nsituation. Cf. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 397\u2013398\n(2000). That is because, even if AEDPA deference does not\napply, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under de novo\nreview, the more favorable standard of review for Thomp\nkins. Courts cannot grant writs of habeas corpus under\n\u00a72254 by engaging only in de novo review when it is un\nclear whether AEDPA deference applies, \u00a72254(d). In\nthose situations, courts must resolve whether AEDPA\ndeference applies, because if it does, a habeas petitioner\nmay not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a72254(d). Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas\ncorpus under \u00a72254 by engaging in de novo review when it\nis unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a\nhabeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas\ncorpus if his or her claim is rejected on de novo review, see\n\u00a72254(a).\n  It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction\nabout the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient\nrepresentation; but on the assumption that it was, on this\nrecord Thompkins cannot show prejudice. The record\nestablishes that it was not reasonably likely that the\ninstruction would have made any difference in light of all\nthe other evidence of guilt. The surviving victim, Freder\nick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the\nidentification was supported by a photograph taken from a\nsurveillance camera. Thompkins\u2019s friend Omar Stephens\ntestified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone\nconversation, and the details of that confession were cor\nroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped the van\nand abandoned it after the shooting. The jury, moreover,\nwas capable of assessing Purifoy\u2019s credibility, as it was\ninstructed to do. The jury in Thompkins\u2019s case could have\nconcluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy\u2019s case made a\nmistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact\nguilty of the crime for which he had been charged. There\nwas ample evidence in the record to support Thompkins\u2019s\nguilt under either theory, and his jury was instructed to\nweigh all of the evidence in determining whether there\nwas guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Under our de novo\nreview of this record, Thompkins cannot show prejudice.\n                     *   *     *\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,\nand the case is remanded with instructions to deny the\npetition.\n                                        It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

VAN \n\n           CHESTER THOMPKINS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS,\nJUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.\n   The Court concludes today that a criminal suspect\nwaives his right to remain silent if, after sitting tacit and\nuncommunicative through nearly three hours of police\ninterrogation, he utters a few one-word responses. The\nCourt also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard\nhis right to remain silent against such a finding of\n\u201cwaiver\u201d must, counterintuitively, speak\u2014and must do so\nwith sufficient precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule\nthat construes ambiguity in favor of the police. Both\npropositions mark a substantial retreat from the protec\u00ad\ntion against compelled self-incrimination that Miranda v.\nArizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), has long provided during\ncustodial interrogation. The broad rules the Court an\u00ad\nnounces today are also troubling because they are unnec\u00ad\nessary to decide this case, which is governed by the defer\u00ad\nential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d). Because I believe Thompkins is entitled\nto relief under AEDPA on the ground that his statements\nwere admitted at trial without the prosecution having\ncarried its burden to show that he waived his right to\nremain silent; because longstanding principles of judicial\nrestraint counsel leaving for another day the questions of\n2                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nlaw the Court reaches out to decide; and because the\nCourt\u2019s answers to those questions do not result from a\nfaithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                              I\n   We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that\nThompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both\nMiranda and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). 547 F. 3d 572 (2008). As to the Miranda claims,\nThompkins argues first that through his conduct during\nthe 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked\nhis right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off ques\u00ad\ntioning in accordance with Miranda and Michigan v.\nMosley, 423 U. S. 96 (1975). Thompkins also contends his\nstatements were in any case inadmissible because the\nprosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under\nMiranda of proving that he knowingly and intelligently\nwaived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit\nagreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach\nthe question of invocation. 547 F. 3d, at 583\u2013584, n. 4. In\nmy view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invoca\u00ad\ntion claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to\nwaiver. Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth\nCircuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins\u2019\nclaim that he received constitutionally ineffective assis\u00ad\ntance of counsel.\n   The strength of Thompkins\u2019 Miranda claims depends in\nlarge part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interroga\u00ad\ntion, at the end of which he made inculpatory statements\nlater introduced at trial. The Court\u2019s opinion downplays\nrecord evidence that Thompkins remained almost com\u00ad\npletely silent and unresponsive throughout that session.\nOne of the interrogating officers, Detective Helgert, testi\u00ad\nfied that although Thompkins was administered Miranda\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nwarnings, the last of which he read aloud, Thompkins\nexpressly declined to sign a written acknowledgment that\nhe had been advised of and understood his rights. There\nis conflicting evidence in the record about whether\nThompkins ever verbally confirmed understanding his\nrights.1 The record contains no indication that the officers\nsought or obtained an express waiver.\n   As to the interrogation itself, Helgert candidly charac\u00ad\nterized it as \u201cvery, very one-sided\u201d and \u201cnearly a mono\u00ad\nlogue.\u201d App. 10a, 17a. Thompkins was \u201c[p]eculiar,\u201d\n\u201c[s]ullen,\u201d and \u201c[g]enerally quiet.\u201d Id., at 149a. Helgert\nand his partner \u201cdid most of the talking,\u201d as Thompkins\nwas \u201cnot verbally communicative\u201d and \u201c[l]argely\u201d re\u00ad\nmained silent. Id., at 149a, 17a, 19a. To the extent\nThompkins gave any response, his answers consisted of \u201ca\nword or two. A \u2018yeah,\u2019 or a \u2018no,\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 . . . And\nsometimes . . . he simply sat down . . . with [his] head in\n[his] hands looking down. Sometimes . . . he would look up\nand make eye-contact would be the only response.\u201d Id., at\n23a\u201324a. After proceeding in this fashion for approxi\u00ad\nmately 2 hours and 45 minutes, Helgert asked Thompkins\nthree questions relating to his faith in God. The prosecu\u00ad\ntion relied at trial on Thompkins\u2019 one-word answers of\n\u201cyes.\u201d See id., at 10a\u201311a.\n   Thompkins\u2019 nonresponsiveness is particularly striking\nin the context of the officers\u2019 interview strategy, later\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At the suppression hearing, Detective Helgert testified that after\nreading Thompkins the warnings, \u201cI believe I asked him if he under\u00ad\nstood the Rights, and I think I got a verbal answer to that as a \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d\nApp. 9a. In denying the motion to suppress, the trial court relied on\nthat factual premise. Id., at 26a. In his later testimony at trial, Hel\u00ad\ngert remembered the encounter differently. Asked whether Thompkins\n\u201cindicate[d] that he understood [the warnings]\u201d after they had been\nread, Helgert stated \u201cI don\u2019t know that I orally asked him that ques\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Id., at 148a. Nevertheless, the Michigan Court of Appeals stated\nthat Thompkins verbally acknowledged understanding his rights. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 75a.\n4                 BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nexplained as conveying to Thompkins that \u201cthis was his\nopportunity to explain his side [of the story]\u201d because\n\u201c[e]verybody else, including [his] co-[d]efendants, had\ngiven their version,\u201d and asking him \u201c[w]ho is going to\nspeak up for you if you don\u2019t speak up for yourself?\u201d Id., at\n10a, 21a. Yet, Helgert confirmed that the \u201conly thing\n[Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shoot\u00ad\ning]\u201d occurred near the end of the interview\u2014i.e., in re\u00ad\nsponse to the questions about God. Id., at 10a\u201311a (em\u00ad\nphasis added).

Since the State is\n    responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances\n    under which [an] interrogation takes place and has\n    the only means of making available corroborated evi\u00ad\n    dence of warnings given during incommunicado inter\u00ad\n    rogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.\n       \u201cAn express statement that the individual is willing\n    to make a statement and does not want an attorney\n    followed closely by a statement could constitute a\n    waiver. But a valid waiver will not be presumed sim\u00ad\n    ply from the silence of the accused after warnings are\n    given or simply from the fact that a confession was in\n    fact eventually obtained.\u201d 384 U.

In these circum\u00ad\n    stances the fact that the individual eventually made a\n    statement is consistent with the conclusion that the\n    compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced\n    him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a\n    voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.\u201d Id., at\n    476.\n  This Court\u2019s decisions subsequent to Miranda have\nemphasized the prosecution\u2019s \u201cheavy burden\u201d in proving\nwaiver. See, e.g., Tague v. Louisiana, 444 U. S. 469, 470\u2013\n471 (1980) (per curiam); Fare v. Michael C., 442 U. S. 707,\n724 (1979). We have also reaffirmed that a court may not\npresume waiver from a suspect\u2019s silence or from the mere\nfact that a confession was eventually obtained. See North\nCarolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979).\n  Even in concluding that Miranda does not invariably\nrequire an express waiver of the right to silence or the\nright to counsel, this Court in Butler made clear that the\nprosecution bears a substantial burden in establishing an\nimplied waiver. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had\nobtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and\nconfirming that he understood them. When presented\nwith a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the\nagents, \u201c \u2018I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.\u2019 \u201d\n441 U. S., at 371. He then made inculpatory statements,\nwhich he later sought to suppress on the ground that he\nhad not expressly waived his right to counsel.\n  Although this Court reversed the state-court judgment\nconcluding that the statements were inadmissible, we\nquoted at length portions of the Miranda opinion repro\u00ad\nduced above. We cautioned that even an \u201cexpress written\nor oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or\nof the right to counsel\u201d is not \u201cinevitably . . . sufficient to\nestablish waiver,\u201d emphasizing that \u201c[t]he question is . . .\n8                    BERGHUIS v.

Miranda, we observed, \u201cunequivocally said\n. . . mere silence is not enough.\u201d 441 U. S., at 373. While\nwe stopped short in Butler of announcing a per se rule that\n\u201cthe defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of\nhis rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may\nnever support a conclusion that a defendant has waived\nhis rights,\u201d we reiterated that \u201ccourts must presume that a\ndefendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\u2019s bur\u00ad\nden is great.\u201d Ibid.2\n    Rarely do this Court\u2019s precedents provide clearly estab\u00ad\nlished law so closely on point with the facts of a particular\ncase. Together, Miranda and Butler establish that a court\n\u201cmust presume that a defendant did not waive his\nright[s]\u201d; the prosecution bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d in at\u00ad\ntempting to demonstrate waiver; the fact of a \u201clengthy\ninterrogation\u201d prior to obtaining statements is \u201cstrong\nevidence\u201d against a finding of valid waiver; \u201cmere silence\u201d\nin response to questioning is \u201cnot enough\u201d; and waiver\nmay not be presumed \u201csimply from the fact that a confes\u00ad\nsion was in fact eventually obtained.\u201d Miranda, supra, at\n475\u2013476; Butler, supra, at 372\u2013373.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 TheCourt cites Colorado v.

Connelly did reject a clear and convincing\nevidence standard of proof in favor of a preponderance burden. But\nnothing in Connelly displaced the core presumption against finding a\nwaiver of rights, and we have subsequently relied on Miranda\u2019s charac\u00ad\nterization of the prosecution\u2019s burden as \u201cheavy.\u201d See Arizona v.\nRoberson, 486 U. S. 675, 680 (1988).\n   3 Likely reflecting the great weight of the prosecution\u2019s burden in\n\nproving implied waiver, many contemporary police training resources\ninstruct officers to obtain a waiver of rights prior to proceeding at all\nwith an interrogation. See, e.g., F. Inbau, J. Reid, J. Buckley, & B.\nJayne, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 491 (4th ed. 2004)\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  It is undisputed here that Thompkins never expressly\nwaived his right to remain silent. His refusal to sign even\nan acknowledgment that he understood his Miranda\nrights evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those\nrights. Cf. United States v. Plugh, 576 F. 3d 135, 142\n(CA2 2009) (suspect\u2019s refusal to sign waiver-of-rights form\n\u201cconstituted an unequivocally negative answer to the\nquestion . . . whether he was willing to waive his rights\u201d).\nThat Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements\nat issue until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes\nof interrogation serves as \u201cstrong evidence\u201d against\nwaiver. Miranda and Butler expressly preclude the possi\u00ad\nbility that the inculpatory statements themselves are\nsufficient to establish waiver.\n  In these circumstances, Thompkins\u2019 \u201cactions and words\u201d\npreceding the inculpatory statements simply do not evi\u00ad\ndence a \u201ccourse of conduct indicating waiver\u201d sufficient to\ncarry the prosecution\u2019s burden. See Butler, supra, at 373.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(hereinafter Inbau) (\u201cOnce [a] waiver is given, the police may proceed\nwith the interrogation\u201d); D. Zulawski & D. Wicklander, Practical\nAspects of Interview and Interrogation 55 (2d ed. 2002) (\u201cOnly upon the\nwaiver of th[e] [Miranda] rights by the suspect can an interrogation\noccur\u201d); see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense\nLawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 11\u201312 (hereinafter NACDL brief)\n(collecting authorities).\n  4 Although such decisions are not controlling under AEDPA, it is\n\nnotable that lower courts have similarly required a showing of words or\nconduct beyond inculpatory statements. See, e.g., United States v.\nWallace, 848 F. 2d 1464, 1475 (CA9 1988) (no implied waiver when\nwarned suspect \u201cmaintained her silence for . . . perhap[s] as many as\nten minutes\u201d before answering a question); McDonald v. Lucas, 677\nF. 2d 518, 521\u2013522 (CA5 1982) (no implied waiver when defendant\nrefused to sign waiver and there was \u201cno evidence of words or actions\nimplying a waiver, except the [inculpatory] statement\u201d). Generally,\ncourts have found implied waiver when a warned suspect has made\nincriminating statements \u201cas part of a steady stream of speech or as\npart of a back-and-forth conversation with the police,\u201d or when a\nwarned suspect who previously invoked his right \u201cspontaneously\nrecommences the dialogue with his interviewers.\u201d Bui v. DiPaolo, 170\n10                   BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nAlthough the Michigan court stated that Thompkins\n\u201csporadically\u201d participated in the interview, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 75a, that court\u2019s opinion and the record before us\nare silent as to the subject matter or context of even a\nsingle question to which Thompkins purportedly re\u00ad\nsponded, other than the exchange about God and the\nstatements respecting the peppermint and the chair.\nUnlike in Butler, Thompkins made no initial declaration\nakin to \u201cI will talk to you.\u201d See also 547 F. 3d, at 586\u2013587\n(case below) (noting that the case might be different if the\nrecord showed Thompkins had responded affirmatively to\nan invitation to tell his side of the story or described any\nparticular question that Thompkins answered). Indeed,\nMichigan and the United States concede that no waiver\noccurred in this case until Thompkins responded \u201cyes\u201d to\nthe questions about God. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 30. I\nbelieve it is objectively unreasonable under our clearly\nestablished precedents to conclude the prosecution met its\n\u201cheavy burden\u201d of proof on a record consisting of three one\u00ad\nword answers, following 2 hours and 45 minutes of silence\npunctuated by a few largely nonverbal responses to uni\u00ad\ndentified questions.\n                           B\n  Perhaps because our prior Miranda precedents so\nclearly favor Thompkins, the Court today goes beyond\nAEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review and announces a\nnew general principle of law.

Wold Engineering, P. C., 467 U. S. 138, 157\n(1984). Consistent with that rule, we have frequently\ndeclined to address questions beyond what is necessary to\nresolve a case under AEDPA. See, e.g., Tyler v. Cain, 533\nU. S. 656, 667\u2013668 (2001) (declining to address question\nwhere any statement by this Court would be \u201cdictum\u201d in\nlight of AEDPA\u2019s statutory constraints on habeas review);\ncf. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 522 (2003) (noting that\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000), \u201cmade no new\nlaw\u201d because the \u201ccase was before us on habeas review\u201d).\nNo necessity exists to justify the Court\u2019s broad announce\u00ad\nment today.\n   The Court concludes that when Miranda warnings have\nbeen given and understood, \u201can accused\u2019s uncoerced\nstatement establishes an implied waiver of the right to\nremain silent.\u201d Ante, at 12\u201313. More broadly still, the\nCourt states that, \u201c[a]s a general proposition, the law can\npresume that an individual who, with a full understanding\nof his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with\ntheir exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish\nthe protection those rights afford.\u201d Ante, at 13.\n   These principles flatly contradict our longstanding\nviews that \u201ca valid waiver will not be presumed . . . simply\nfrom the fact that a confession was in fact eventually\nobtained,\u201d Miranda, 384 U. S., at 475, and that \u201c[t]he\ncourts must presume that a defendant did not waive his\nrights,\u201d Butler, 441 U. S., at 373. Indeed, we have in the\npast summarily reversed a state-court decision that in\u00ad\nverted Miranda\u2019s antiwaiver presumption, characterizing\n12                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe error as \u201creadily apparent.\u201d Tague, 444 U. S., at 470\u2013\n471. At best, the Court today creates an unworkable and\nconflicting set of presumptions that will undermine\nMiranda\u2019s goal of providing \u201cconcrete constitutional guide\u00ad\nlines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow,\u201d\n384 U. S., at 442. At worst, it overrules sub silentio an\nessential aspect of the protections Miranda has long pro\u00ad\nvided for the constitutional guarantee against self\u00ad\nincrimination.\n   The Court\u2019s conclusion that Thompkins\u2019 inculpatory\nstatements were sufficient to establish an implied waiver,\nante, at 14, finds no support in Butler. Butler itself distin\u00ad\nguished between a sufficient \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d and in\u00ad\nculpatory statements, reiterating Miranda\u2019s admonition\nthat \u201c \u2018a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from . . .\nthe fact that a confession was in fact eventually ob\u00ad\ntained.\u2019 \u201d Butler, supra, at 373 (quoting Miranda, supra,\nat 475). Michigan suggests Butler\u2019s silence \u201c \u2018when ad\u00ad\nvised of his right to the assistance of a lawyer,\u2019 \u201d combined\nwith our remand for the state court to apply the implied\u00ad\nwaiver standard, shows that silence followed by state\u00ad\nments can be a \u201c \u2018course of conduct.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner\n26 (quoting Butler, supra, at 371). But the evidence of\nimplied waiver in Butler was worlds apart from the evi\u00ad\ndence in this case, because Butler unequivocally said \u201cI\nwill talk to you\u201d after having been read Miranda warn\u00ad\nings. Thompkins, of course, made no such statement.\n   The Court also relies heavily on Burbine in characteriz\u00ad\ning the scope of the prosecution\u2019s burden in proving\nwaiver. Consistent with Burbine, the Court observes, the\nprosecution must prove that waiver was \u201c \u2018voluntary in the\nsense that it was the product of a free and deliberate\nchoice rather than intimidation\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018made with a full\nawareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned\nand the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 10 (quoting 475 U.

What it omits, however, is\nthat the prosecution also bears an antecedent burden of\nshowing there was, in fact, either an express waiver or a\n\u201ccourse of conduct\u201d sufficiently clear to support a finding of\nimplied waiver. Nothing in Burbine even hints at remov\u00ad\ning that obligation. The question in that case, rather, was\nwhether a suspect\u2019s multiple express waivers of his rights\nwere invalid because police \u201cmisinformed an inquiring\nattorney about their plans concerning the suspect or be\u00ad\ncause they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney\u2019s\nefforts to reach him.\u201d Id., at 420; see also Colorado v.\nSpring, 479 U. S. 564, 573 (1987). The Court\u2019s analysis in\nBurbine was predicated on the existence of waiver-in-fact.\n  Today\u2019s dilution of the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof to\nthe bare fact that a suspect made inculpatory statements\nafter Miranda warnings were given and understood takes\nan unprecedented step away from the \u201chigh standards of\nproof for the waiver of constitutional rights\u201d this Court has\nlong demanded. Miranda, supra, at 475; cf. Brewer v.\nWilliams, 430 U. S. 387, 404 (1977) (\u201c[C]ourts indulge in\nevery reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d); Zerbst,\n304 U. S., at 464. When waiver is to be inferred during a\ncustodial interrogation, there are sound reasons to require\nevidence beyond inculpatory statements themselves.\nMiranda and our subsequent cases are premised on the\nidea that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.\nSee 384 U. S., at 455 (\u201cEven without employing brutality,\nthe \u2018third degree\u2019 or [other] specific strategems . . . the\nvery fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on\nindividual liberty and trades on the weakness of individu\u00ad\nals\u201d); Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.

Such a result bears little sem\u00ad\nblance to the \u201cfully effective\u201d prophylaxis, 384 U. S., at\n444, that Miranda requires.\n                              A\n   Thompkins\u2019 claim for relief under AEDPA rests on the\nclearly established federal law of Miranda and Mosley. In\nMiranda, the Court concluded that \u201c[i]f [an] individual\nindicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during\nquestioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interro\u00ad\ngation must cease. . . . [A]ny statement taken after the\nperson invokes his privilege cannot be other than the\nproduct of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.\u201d 384 U. S., at\n473\u2013474. In Mosley, the Court said that a \u201ccritical safe\u00ad\nguard\u201d of the right to remain silent is a suspect\u2019s \u201c \u2018right to\ncut off questioning.\u2019 \u201d 423 U. S., at 103 (quoting Miranda,\nsupra, at 474). Thus, \u201cthe admissibility of statements\nobtained after the person in custody has decided to remain\nsilent depends under Miranda on whether his \u2018right to cut\noff questioning\u2019 was \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d 423 U. S., at\n104.5\n   Thompkins contends that in refusing to respond to\nquestions he effectively invoked his right to remain silent,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 In holding that Mosley\u2019s right had been \u201c \u2018scrupulously honored,\u2019 \u201d\n\nthe Court observed that he was properly advised of his rights and\nindicated his understanding in writing; that police \u201cimmediately\nceased\u201d interrogation when Mosley stated he did not want to discuss\nthe crime and allowed an \u201cinterval of more than two hours\u201d to pass\nbefore reapproaching Mosley \u201cat another location about an unrelated\n[crime]\u201d; and that Mosley was readministered \u201cfull and complete\nMiranda warnings at the outset of the second interrogation\u201d and had a\n\u201cfull and fair opportunity to exercise th[o]se options.\u201d 423 U.

THOMPKINS\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsuch that police were required to terminate the interroga\u00ad\ntion prior to his inculpatory statements. In Michigan\u2019s\nview, Thompkins cannot prevail under AEDPA because\nthis Court\u2019s precedents have not previously established\nwhether a suspect\u2019s ambiguous statements or actions\nrequire the police to stop questioning. We have held that\na suspect who has \u201c \u2018invoked his right to have counsel\npresent . . . is not subject to further interrogation by the\nauthorities until counsel has been made available to him,\nunless [he] initiates further communication, exchanges, or\nconversations with the police.\u2019 \u201d Maryland v. Shatzer, 559\nU. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Edwards v.\nArizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484\u2013485 (1981)). Notwithstanding\nMiranda\u2019s statement that \u201cthere can be no questioning\u201d if\na suspect \u201cindicates in any manner . . . that he wishes to\nconsult with an attorney,\u201d 384 U. S., at 444\u2013445, the Court\nin Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 461 (1994) estab\u00ad\nlished a clear-statement rule for invoking the right to\ncounsel. After a suspect has knowingly and voluntarily\nwaived his Miranda rights, Davis held, police may con\u00ad\ntinue questioning \u201cuntil and unless the suspect clearly\nrequests an attorney.\u201d 512 U. S., at 461 (emphasis added).\n   Because this Court has never decided whether Davis\u2019\nclear-statement rule applies to an invocation of the right\nto silence, Michigan contends, there was no clearly estab\u00ad\nlished federal law prohibiting the state court from requir\u00ad\ning an unambiguous invocation. That the state court\u2019s\ndecision was not objectively unreasonable is confirmed, in\nMichigan\u2019s view, by the number of federal Courts of Ap\u00ad\npeals to have applied Davis to invocation of the right to\nsilence. Brief for Petitioner 44.\n   Under AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review, it is\nindeed difficult to conclude that the state court\u2019s applica\u00ad\ntion of our precedents was objectively unreasonable.\nAlthough the duration and consistency of Thompkins\u2019\nrefusal to answer questions throughout the 3-hour inter\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nrogation provide substantial evidence in support of his\nclaim, Thompkins did not remain absolutely silent, and\nthis Court has not previously addressed whether a suspect\ncan invoke the right to silence by remaining uncooperative\nand nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes.\n                               B\n   The Court, however, eschews this narrow ground of\ndecision, instead extending Davis to hold that police may\ncontinue questioning a suspect until he unambiguously\ninvokes his right to remain silent. Because Thompkins\nneither said \u201che wanted to remain silent\u201d nor said \u201che did\nnot want to talk with the police,\u201d the Court concludes, he\ndid not clearly invoke his right to silence. Ante, at 8\u201310.6\n   I disagree with this novel application of Davis. Neither\nthe rationale nor holding of that case compels today\u2019s\nresult. Davis involved the right to counsel, not the right to\nsilence. The Court in Davis reasoned that extending\nEdwards\u2019 \u201crigid\u201d prophylactic rule to ambiguous requests\nfor a lawyer would transform Miranda into a \u201c \u2018wholly\nirrational obstacl[e] to legitimate police investigative\nactivity\u2019 \u201d by \u201cneedlessly prevent[ing] the police from ques\u00ad\ntioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if [he] did\nnot wish to have a lawyer present.\u201d Davis, supra, at 460.\nBut Miranda itself \u201cdistinguished between the procedural\nsafeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a\nrequest for an attorney.\u201d Mosley, supra, at 104, n. 10;\naccord, Edwards, supra, at 485. Mosley upheld the admis\u00ad\nsion of statements when police immediately stopped inter\u00ad\nrogating a suspect who invoked his right to silence, but\nreapproached him after a 2-hour delay and obtained in\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court also ignores a second available avenue to avoid reaching\n\nthe constitutional question. Because the Sixth Circuit declined to\ndecide Thompkins\u2019 invocation claim, a remand would permit the lower\ncourt to address the question in the first instance. Cf. Cutter v. Wilkin\nson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005).\n18                   BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nculpatory responses relating to a different crime after\nadministering fresh Miranda warnings. The different\neffects of invoking the rights are consistent with distinct\nstandards for invocation. To the extent Mosley contem\u00ad\nplates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than Edwards\u2014\nand, in particular, does not categorically bar police from\nreapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to\nremain silent\u2014Davis\u2019 concern about \u201c \u2018wholly irrational\nobstacles\u2019 \u201d to police investigation applies with less force.\n   In addition, the suspect\u2019s equivocal reference to a lawyer\nin Davis occurred only after he had given express oral and\nwritten waivers of his rights. Davis\u2019 holding is explicitly\npredicated on that fact. See 512 U. S., at 461 (\u201cWe there\u00ad\nfore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the\nMiranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue\nquestioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests\nan attorney\u201d). The Court ignores this aspect of Davis, as\nwell as the decisions of numerous federal and state courts\ndeclining to apply a clear-statement rule when a suspect\nhas not previously given an express waiver of rights.7\n   In my mind, a more appropriate standard for addressing\na suspect\u2019s ambiguous invocation of the right to remain\nsilent is the constraint Mosley places on questioning a\nsuspect who has invoked that right: The suspect\u2019s \u201c \u2018right\nto cut off questioning\u2019 \u201d must be \u201c \u2018scrupulously honored.\u2019 \u201d\nSee 423 U. S., at 104. Such a standard is necessarily\nprecautionary and fact specific. The rule would acknowl\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See, e.g., United States v.

Under such\ncircumstances, \u201cscrupulous\u201d respect for the suspect\u2019s\nrights will require police to terminate questioning under\nMosley.8\n   To be sure, such a standard does not provide police with\na bright-line rule. Cf. ante, at 9\u201310. But, as we have\npreviously recognized, Mosley itself does not offer clear\nguidance to police about when and how interrogation may\ncontinue after a suspect invokes his rights. See Solem v.\nStumes, 465 U. S. 638, 648 (1984); see also Shatzer, 559\nU. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concur\u00ad\nring in judgment) (slip op., at 3). Given that police have\nfor nearly 35 years applied Mosley\u2019s fact-specific standard\nin questioning suspects who have invoked their right to\nremain silent; that our cases did not during that time\nresolve what statements or actions suffice to invoke that\nright; and that neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General\nhave provided evidence in this case that the status quo\nhas proved unworkable, I see little reason to believe to\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Indeed, this rule appears to reflect widespread contemporary police\npractice. Thompkins\u2019 amici collect a range of training materials that\ninstruct police not to engage in prolonged interrogation after a suspect\nhas failed to respond to initial questioning. See NACDL Brief 32\u201334.\nOne widely used police manual, for example, teaches that a suspect\nwho \u201cindicates,\u201d \u201ceven by silence itself,\u201d his unwillingness to answer\nquestions \u201chas obviously exercised his constitutional privilege against\nself-incrimination.\u201d Inbau 498.\n20                BERGHUIS v. THOMPKINS\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nday\u2019s clear-statement rule is necessary to ensure effective\nlaw enforcement.\n   Davis\u2019 clear-statement rule is also a poor fit for the right\nto silence. Advising a suspect that he has a \u201cright to\nremain silent\u201d is unlikely to convey that he must speak\n(and must do so in some particular fashion) to ensure the\nright will be protected. Cf. Soffar v. Cockrell, 300 F. 3d\n588, 603 (CA5 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cWhat in the world must an individual do to exercise his\nconstitutional right to remain silent beyond actually, in\nfact, remaining silent?\u201d). By contrast, telling a suspect \u201che\nhas the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he\ncannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him\nprior to any questioning if he so desires,\u201d Miranda, 384\nU. S., at 479, implies the need for speech to exercise that\nright. Davis\u2019 requirement that a suspect must \u201cclearly\nreques[t] an attorney\u201d to terminate questioning thus\naligns with a suspect\u2019s likely understanding of the\nMiranda warnings in a way today\u2019s rule does not. The\nCourt suggests Thompkins could have employed the \u201csim\u00ad\nple, unambiguous\u201d means of saying \u201che wanted to remain\nsilent\u201d or \u201cdid not want to talk with the police.\u201d Ante, at\n10. But the Miranda warnings give no hint that a suspect\nshould use those magic words, and there is little reason to\nbelieve police\u2014who have ample incentives to avoid invoca\u00ad\ntion\u2014will provide such guidance.\n   Conversely, the Court\u2019s concern that police will face\n\u201cdifficult decisions about an accused\u2019s unclear intent\u201d and\nsuffer the consequences of \u201c \u2018guess[ing] wrong,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 9\u2013\n10 (quoting Davis, 512 U. S., at 461), is misplaced. If a\nsuspect makes an ambiguous statement or engages in\nconduct that creates uncertainty about his intent to invoke\nhis right, police can simply ask for clarification. See id., at\n467 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). It is hardly an\nunreasonable burden for police to ask a suspect, for in\u00ad\nstance, \u201cDo you want to talk to us?\u201d The majority in Davis\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Given this straight\u00ad\nforward mechanism by which police can \u201cscrupulously\nhono[r]\u201d a suspect\u2019s right to silence, today\u2019s clear\u00ad\nstatement rule can only be seen as accepting \u201cas tolerable\nthe certainty that some poorly expressed requests [to\nremain silent] will be disregarded,\u201d id., at 471 (opinion of\nSouter, J.), without any countervailing benefit. Police may\nwell prefer not to seek clarification of an ambiguous\nstatement out of fear that a suspect will invoke his rights.\nBut \u201cour system of justice is not founded on a fear that a\nsuspect will exercise his rights. \u2018If the exercise of constitu\u00ad\ntional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of\nlaw enforcement, then there is something very wrong with\nthat system.\u2019 \u201d Burbine, 475 U. S., at 458 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (quoting Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.

Ante, at\n10. Experience suggests the contrary. In the 16 years\nsince Davis was decided, ample evidence has accrued that\ncriminal suspects often use equivocal or colloquial lan\u00ad\nguage in attempting to invoke their right to silence. A\nnumber of lower courts that have (erroneously, in my\nview) imposed a clear-statement requirement for invoca\u00ad\ntion of the right to silence have rejected as ambiguous an\narray of statements whose meaning might otherwise be\nthought plain.9 At a minimum, these decisions suggest\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 See United States v.

See, e.g., People v. Silva, 45 Cal.\n3d 604, 629\u2013630, 754 P. 2d 1070, 1083\u20131084 (1988) (\u201c \u2018I really don\u2019t\nwant to talk about that\u2019 \u201d only conveyed unwillingness to discuss certain\nsubjects).

Criminal\nsuspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to\nremain silent\u2014which, counterintuitively, requires them to\nspeak. At the same time, suspects will be legally pre\u00ad\nsumed to have waived their rights even if they have given\nno clear expression of their intent to do so. Those results,\nin my view, find no basis in Miranda or our subsequent\ncases and are inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on\nwhich those precedents are grounded. Today\u2019s broad new\nrules are all the more unfortunate because they are un\u00ad\nnecessary to the disposition of the case before us. I re\u00ad\nspectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
