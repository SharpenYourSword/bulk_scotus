NORTH CAROLINA\n\nON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS\n               OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n\n    No. 132, Orig. Argued January 11, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010\nIn 1986, Congress granted its consent to the Southeast Interstate Low-\n  Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact (Compact), which\n  was entered into by Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North\n  Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Compact is\n  administered by a Commission, which was required, inter alia, to\n  “identif[y] a host State for the development of a [new] regional\n  disposal facility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is licensed\n  and ready to operate . . . no . . . later than 1991.” Art. 4(E)(6), 99\n  Stat. 1875. The Commission designated North Carolina as a host\n  State in 1986, thereby obligating North Carolina to take “appropriate\n  steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and op\n  erate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is filed with and\n  issued by the appropriate authority.” Art. 5(C), id., at 1877.\n     In 1988, North Carolina asked the Commission for assistance with\n  the costs of licensing and building a facility. The Commission\n  adopted a resolution declaring it “appropriate and necessary” to pro\n  vide financial assistance, and ultimately paid almost $80 million to\n  North Carolina from 1988 through 1997. North Carolina also ex\n  pended $34 million of its own funds. Yet by the mid 1990s, North\n  Carolina was still many years—and many tens of millions of dol\n  lars—away from obtaining a license.\n     In 1997, the Commission notified North Carolina that absent a\n  plan for funding the remaining licensing steps, it would not disburse\n  additional funds to North Carolina. North Carolina responded that it\n  could not continue without additional funding. After the parties\n  failed to agree on a long-term financing plan, in December 1997 the\n  Commission ceased its financial assistance to North Carolina, and\n  North Carolina subsequently began an orderly shutdown of its pro\n2                   ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ject.\n       In June 1999, Florida and Tennessee filed a complaint with the\n    Commission seeking monetary sanctions against North Carolina. In\n    July 1999, North Carolina exercised its right under Article 7(G) to\n    withdraw from the Compact. In December 1999, the Commission\n    concluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obligations un\n    der the Compact and adopted a sanctions resolution demanding that\n    the State repay approximately $80 million in addition to other mone\n    tary penalties. North Carolina did not comply.\n       In 2003, this Court granted Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia,\n    and the Commission (Plaintiffs) leave to file a bill of complaint\n    against North Carolina under this Court’s original jurisdiction, U. S.\n    Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. §1251(a). The complaint sets\n    forth claims of violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Compact\n    (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), unjust enrichment (Count\n    III), promissory estoppel (Count IV), and money had and received\n    (Count V), and requests monetary and other relief, including a decla\n    ration that North Carolina is subject to sanctions and that the Com\n    mission’s sanctions resolution is valid and enforceable.\n       The Court assigned the case to a Special Master, who has con\n    ducted proceedings and has filed two reports. The Preliminary Re\n    port recommends denying without prejudice North Carolina’s motion\n    to dismiss the Commission’s claims on sovereign immunity grounds;\n    denying Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on Count I, which\n    sought enforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution; grant\n    ing North Carolina’s cross-motion to dismiss Count I and other por\n    tions of the complaint seeking such enforcement; and denying North\n    Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts II–V. The Master’s\n    Second Report recommended denying Plaintiff’s motion for summary\n    judgment and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary judg\n    ment on Count II; and denying North Carolina’s motion for summary\n    judgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims in Counts III–V. The par\n    ties filed a total of nine exceptions to the Master’s Reports.\nHeld:\n    1. Plaintiffs’ seven exceptions are overruled. Pp. 7–21.\n       (a) The terms of the Compact do not authorize the Commission to\n impose monetary sanctions against North Carolina. The Court’s con\n clusion is confirmed by a comparison of the Compact’s terms with\n three other interstate compacts concerning low-level radioactive\n waste storage approved by Congress contemporaneously with the\n Compact, all of which expressly authorize their commissions to im\n pose monetary sanctions against their party States. Pp. 7–9.\n       (b) Plaintiffs’ exception that North Carolina could not avoid\n monetary sanctions by withdrawing from the Compact is moot, be\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncause the Compact does not permit the Commission to impose mone\ntary sanctions in any event. The Court deems their exception that\nNorth Carolina forfeited its right to object to a monetary penalty by\nfailing to participate at the sanctions hearing both abandoned and\nmeritless. P. 10.\n      (c) Because the express terms of the Compact do not make the\nCommission the “sole arbiter” of disputes arising under the Compact,\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 569–570, the Court is not bound\nby the Commission’s conclusion that North Carolina breached its ob\nligations under the Compact. Nor does the Court apply deferential\nadministrative-law standards of review to the Commission’s conclu\nsion, but instead exercises its independent judgment as to both fact\nand law in executing its role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controver\nsies between the States, 28 U. S. C. §1251(a). Pp. 10–12.\n      (d) North Carolina did not breach its contractual obligation to\ntake “appropriate steps” toward the issuance of a license. Pp. 12–19.\n         (1) The Compact requires North Carolina to take only those li\ncensing steps that are “appropriate.” The parties’ course of perform\nance establishes that it was not appropriate for North Carolina to\nproceed with the very expensive licensing process without external\nfinancial assistance. Nothing in the Compact’s text or structure re\nquires North Carolina to cover all licensing and building costs on its\nown. Plaintiffs’ assertion that it was understood that the host State\nwould bear the up-front licensing and construction costs, but recoup\nthose costs through its regional monopoly on radioactive waste dis\nposal, is not reflected in the Compact. Pp. 13–18.\n         (2) Plaintiffs’ alternative argument that North Carolina repu\ndiated its obligation to take appropriate steps when it announced it\nwould take no further steps to obtain a license fails for the same rea\nsons their breach theory fails. Pp. 18–19.\n      (e) North Carolina did not breach an implied duty of good faith\nand fair dealing when it withdrew from the Compact. The Compact\nby its terms imposes no limitation on North Carolina’s right to exer\ncise its statutory right under Article 7(G) to withdraw from the Com\npact. A comparison between the Compact and other contemporane\nously enacted compacts confirms the absence of a good-faith\nlimitation in the Compact. Pp. 19–21.\n   2. North Carolina’s two exceptions are overruled. Pp. 21–26.\n      (a) It was reasonable for the Special Master to deny without\nprejudice North Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on the mer\nits of Plaintiffs’ equitable claims in Counts III–V. The Special Master\nconcluded that those claims require further briefing, argument, and,\npossibly, discovery. The Court approves of the Special Master’s rea\nsonable exercise of his discretion to manage the proceedings. Pp. 21–\n4                   ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    22.\n         (b) Under Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 614, the Commis\n    sion’s claims are not barred by sovereign immunity so long as the\n    Commission asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the\n    plaintiff States. Nothing in the Court’s subsequent cases suggests\n    that Arizona v. California has been implicitly overruled, and North\n    Carolina does not ask the Court to overrule that decision. At least\n    with respect to Counts I and II, the Commission’s claims under those\n    Compact-related Counts are wholly derivative of the plaintiff States’\n    claims. The summary judgment disallowing the claims in Counts I\n    and II on their merits renders the sovereign immunity question with\n    regard to any relief the Commission alone might have on those claims\n    moot. Counts III–V are on a different footing. The Special Master\n    concluded that further factual and legal development was necessary\n    to determine whether the Commission’s claims under these Counts\n    were identical to those of the plaintiff States. The Special Master’s\n    case-management decision was reasonable. Pp. 22–26.\nExceptions to Special Master’s Reports overruled, and Master’s recom\n  mendations adopted; North Carolina’s motions to dismiss Count I\n  and for summary judgment on Count II granted; Plaintiffs’ motions\n  for judgment on Counts I and II denied; and North Carolina’s mo\n  tions to dismiss the Commission’s claims on sovereign immunity\n  grounds and for summary judgment on Counts III–V denied without\n  prejudice.\n\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS,\nGINSBURG, and ALITO, JJ., joined, in which ROBERTS, C.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\nON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS\n               OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, which arises under our original jurisdiction,\nU. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. §1251(a), we\nconsider nine exceptions submitted by the parties to two\nreports filed by the Special Master.\n                             I\n   In 1986, Congress granted its consent under the Com­\npact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3, to seven inter­\nstate compacts providing for the creation of regional facili­\nties to dispose of low-level radioactive waste. Omnibus\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Interstate Compact Consent\nAct, 99 Stat. 1859. One of those compacts was the South­\neast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management\nCompact (Compact), entered into by Alabama, Florida,\nGeorgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee, and Virginia. Id., at 1871–1880. That Com­\npact established an “instrument and framework for a\ncooperative effort” to develop new facilities for the long­\n2              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nterm disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated\nwithin the region. Art. 1, id., at 1872. The Compact was\nto be administered by a Southeast Interstate Low-Level\nRadioactive Waste Management Commission (Commis­\nsion), composed of two voting members from each party\nState. Art. 4(A), id., at 1874.\n   A pre-existing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina was\nto serve as the initial facility for regional generators to\ndispose of their low-level radioactive waste. Art. 2(10), id.,\nat 1873. That facility was scheduled to close as the re­\ngional-disposal facility for the Compact by the end of 1992,\nibid., and so the Compact required the Commission to\ndevelop “procedures and criteria for identifying . . . a host\n[S]tate for the development of a second regional disposal\nfacility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is li­\ncensed and ready to operate as soon as required but in no\nevent later than 1991,” Art. 4(E)(6), id., at 1875. The\nCompact authorized the Commission to “designate” a\nparty State as a host State for the facility. Art. 4(E)(7),\nibid.\n   In September 1986, the Commission designated North\nCarolina as the host for the second facility. North Caro­\nlina therefore became obligated to “take appropriate steps\nto ensure that an application for a license to construct and\noperate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is\nfiled with and issued by the appropriate authority.” Art.\n5(C), id., at 1877. In 1987, North Carolina’s General\nAssembly created the North Carolina Low-Level Radioac­\ntive Waste Management Authority (Authority) to fulfill\nthe State’s obligation. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G (1987), 1987\nN. C. Sess. Laws ch. 850.\n   Although “[t]he Commission is not responsible for any\ncosts associated with,” among other things, “the creation of\nany facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876, North Carolina\nasked the Commission for financial assistance with build­\ning and licensing costs. The Commission responded by\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadopting a resolution, which declared it was both “appro­\npriate and necessary” for the Commission “to provide\nfinancial assistance” to North Carolina. App. 63. To that\nend, the Commission created a “Host States Assistance\nFund” to help North Carolina with the “financial costs and\nburdens” of “preliminary planning, the administrative\npreparation, and other pre-operational” activities. Id., at\n64.\n   The estimate in 1989 was that it would cost approxi­\nmately $21 million and take two years to obtain a license\nfor North Carolina’s regional-disposal facility.      That\nproved to be wildly optimistic. By 1990, the cost estimate\nhad ballooned to $45.8 million, and the estimated date for\nobtaining a license now extended far into 1993. At the\nbeginning of 1994 there still was no license, and the esti­\nmated cost had grown to $87.1 million. By end of 1994 the\nestimate was $112.5 million, and issuance of a license was\nnot anticipated until 1997. And by December 1996 the\nestimated cost had increased by another $27 million and\nthe projected date to receive a license had become August\n2000.\n   North Carolina’s own appropriations—approximately\n$27 million from Fiscal Year 1988 through Fiscal Year\n(FY) 1995—did not cover the costs of the licensing phase.\nBut during the same time period, the Commission pro­\nvided North Carolina with approximately $67 million.\nThe funds came from surcharges and access fees collected\nfor that purpose from generators disposing of low-level\nradioactive waste at the pre-existing Barnwell facility.\nId., at 71–74, 145.\n   In July 1995, however, South Carolina withdrew from\nthe Compact, thereby depriving the Commission of contin­\nued revenues from the Barnwell facility. In 1996, the\nCommission accordingly informed North Carolina that it\nwould no longer be able to provide financial support for\nlicensing activities. The Governor of North Carolina\n4              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresponded that the State was not prepared to assume a\ngreater portion of the project’s costs, and would not be able\nto proceed without continued Commission funding.\nShortly thereafter the Commission adopted a resolution\ndeclaring that it was willing and able to provide additional\nfunds, but calling on North Carolina to work with it to\ndevelop long-term funding sources for the facility. From\nFY 1996 through FY 1998, the Commission provided\nNorth Carolina approximately an additional $12.27 mil­\nlion in financial assistance. North Carolina, for its part,\ncontinued to provide its own funds toward licensing activi­\nties—another $6 million during the same time period.\n   In August 1997, the Commission notified North Caro­\nlina that absent a plan for funding the remaining steps of\nthe licensing phase, it would not disburse additional funds\nto North Carolina after November 30, 1997. North Caro­\nlina responded that it would not be able to continue with­\nout additional guarantees of external funding. On Decem­\nber 1, 1997, the parties having failed to agree upon a long­\nterm financing plan, the Commission ceased financial\nassistance to North Carolina. By then it had provided\nalmost $80 million.\n   On December 19, 1997, North Carolina informed the\nCommission it would commence an orderly shutdown of its\nlicensing project, and since that date has taken no further\nsteps toward obtaining a license for the facility. But it did\ncontinue to fund the Authority for several more years, in\nthe hope that the project would resume upon the restora­\ntion of external financial assistance. North Carolina\nmaintained the proposed facility site, preserved the work\nit had completed to date, and retained the Authority’s\nbooks and records. It also participated in discussions with\nthe Commission, generators of low-level radioactive waste,\nand other stakeholders regarding options to resolve the\nfinancing shortfall. From FY 1988 through FY 2000,\nNorth Carolina had expended almost $34 million toward\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobtaining a license.\n   In June 1999, after attempts to resolve the funding\nimpasse had failed, Florida and Tennessee filed with the\nCommission a complaint for sanctions against North\nCarolina. It alleged that North Carolina had failed to\nfulfill its obligations under the Compact, and requested\n(among other things) return of the almost $80 million paid\nto North Carolina by the Commission, plus interest, as\nwell as damages and attorney’s fees. The next month,\nNorth Carolina withdrew from the Compact by enacting a\nlaw repealing its status as a party State, see 1999 N. C.\nSess. Laws ch. 357, as required by Article 7(G) of the\nCompact.\n   More than four months later, in December 1999, the\nCommission held a sanctions hearing. North Carolina did\nnot participate. After the hearing, the Commission con­\ncluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obliga­\ntions under the Compact. It adopted a resolution demand­\ning that North Carolina repay approximately $80 million,\nplus interest, to the Commission; pay an additional $10\nmillion penalty to compensate the Commission for the loss\nof future revenue (surcharges and access fees) it would\nhave received had a facility been completed in North\nCarolina; and pay the Commission’s attorney’s fees. North\nCarolina did not comply.\n   In July 2000, seeking to enforce its sanctions resolution,\nthe Commission moved for leave to file a bill of complaint\nunder our original jurisdiction. Southeast Interstate Low-\nLevel Radioactive Waste Management Commission v.\nNorth Carolina, No. 131, Orig. North Carolina opposed\nthe motion on the grounds that the Commission could not\ninvoke this Court’s original jurisdiction, and we invited\nthe Solicitor General to express the views of the United\nStates. 531 U. S. 942 (2000). The Solicitor General filed a\nbrief urging denial of the Commission’s motion on the\ngrounds that the Commission’s bill of complaint did not\n6              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfall within our exclusive original jurisdiction over “contro­\nversies between two or more States.” §1251(a). We denied\nthe Commission’s motion. 533 U. S. 926 (2001).\n   In June 2002, the States of Alabama, Florida, Tennes­\nsee, and Virginia, joined by the Commission (collectively\nPlaintiffs), moved for leave to file a bill of complaint\nagainst North Carolina. North Carolina opposed the\nmotion, and we again sought the views of the Solicitor\nGeneral. 537 U. S. 806 (2002). The United States urged\nthat we grant Plaintiffs’ motion, which we did. 539 U. S.\n925 (2003). The bill of complaint contains five counts:\nviolation of the party States’ rights under the Compact\n(Count I); breach of contract (Count II); unjust enrichment\n(Count III), promissory estoppel (Count IV); and money\nhad and received (Count V). Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief\nrequests a declaration that North Carolina is subject to\nsanctions and that the Commission’s sanctions resolution\nis valid and enforceable, as well as the award of damages,\ncosts, and other relief.\n   We assigned the case to a Special Master, 540 U. S.\n1014 (2003), who has conducted proceedings and now has\nfiled two reports. The Master’s Preliminary Report ad­\ndressed three motions filed by the parties. He recom­\nmended denying without prejudice North Carolina’s mo­\ntion to dismiss the Commission’s claims against North\nCarolina on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Prelimi­\nnary Report 4–14. He recommended denying Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on Count I, which sought\nenforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution. Id.,\nat 14–33. He recommended granting North Carolina’s\ncross-motion to dismiss Count I and other portions of the\nbill of complaint that sought enforcement of the sanctions\nresolution. Id., at 33–34. And he recommended denying\nNorth Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts\nII–V. Id., at 34–43.\n   After the Special Master issued his Preliminary Report,\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The Special\nMaster’s Second Report recommended denying Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on Count II, Second Report\n8–35, and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary\njudgment on Count II, id., at 35–40. Finally, he recom­\nmended denying North Carolina’s motion for summary\njudgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims in Counts III–V.\nId., at 41–45.\n                            II\n  Plaintiffs present a total of seven exceptions to the\nSpecial Master’s two reports. We address them in turn.\n                                A\n   Their first exception challenges the Special Master’s\nconclusion that the Commission lacked authority to im­\npose monetary sanctions upon North Carolina. The terms\nof the Compact determine that question.\n   Article 4(E) of the Compact sets forth the Commission’s\n“duties and powers.” Among its powers are the authority\n“[t]o revoke the membership of a party [S]tate that will­\nfully creates barriers to the siting of a needed regional\nfacility,” Art. 4(E)(7), 99 Stat. 1875, and the authority “[t]o\nrevoke the membership of a party [S]tate in accordance\nwith Article 7(f),” Art. 4(E)(11), ibid. Conspicuously ab­\nsent from Article 4, however, is any mention of the author­\nity to impose monetary sanctions. Plaintiffs contend that\nauthority may be found elsewhere—in the first paragraph\nof Article 7(F), which provides in relevant part:\n      “Any party [S]tate which fails to comply with the\n    provisions of this compact or to fulfill the obligations\n    incurred by becoming a party [S]tate to this compact\n    may be subject to sanctions by the Commission, in­\n    cluding suspension of its rights under this compact\n    and revocation of its status as a party [S]tate.” Id., at\n8              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    1879.\nThe sanctions expressly identified in Article 7(F)—\n“suspension” of rights and “revocation” of party-state\nstatus—flow directly from the Commission’s power in\nArticles 4(E)(7) and (11) to revoke a party State’s member­\nship. That can fairly be understood to include the lesser\npower to suspend a party State’s rights. There is no simi­\nlar grounding in Article 4(E) of authority to impose mone­\ntary sanctions, and the absence is significant.\n   According to Plaintiffs, however, the word “sanctions” in\nArticle 7(F) naturally “includ[es]” monetary sanctions.\nSince the Compact contains no definition of “sanctions,”\nwe give the word its ordinary meaning. A “sanction” (in\nthe sense the word is used here) is “[t]he detriment loss of\nreward, or other coercive intervention, annexed to a viola­\ntion of a law as a means of enforcing the law.” Webster’s\nNew International Dictionary 2211 (2d ed. 1957) (herein­\nafter Webster’s Second); see Black’s Law Dictionary 1458\n(9th ed. 2009) (“A penalty or coercive measure that results\nfrom failure to comply with a law, rule, or order”). A\nmonetary penalty is assuredly one kind of “sanction.” See\ngenerally Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607,\n621 (1992). But there are many others, ranging from the\nwithholding of benefits, or the imposition of a nonmone­\ntary obligation, to capital punishment. The Compact\nsurely does not authorize the Commission to impose all of\nthem.\n   Ultimately, context dictates precisely which “sanctions”\nare authorized under Article 7(F), and nothing in the\nCompact suggests that these include monetary measures.\nThe only two “sanctions” specifically identified as being\nincluded within Article 7(F) are “suspension” of a State’s\nrights under the Compact and “revocation” of its status as\na party State. These are arguably merely examples, and\nmay not exhaust the universe of sanctions the Commission\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncan impose. But they do establish “illustrative applica­\ntion[s] of the general principle,” Federal Land Bank of St.\nPaul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941),\nwhich underlies the kinds of sanctions the Commission\ncan impose. It is significant that both these specifically\nauthorized sanctions are prospective and nonmonetary in\nnature.\n   Moreover, Article 3 of the Compact provides: “The rights\ngranted to the party [S]tates by this compact are addi­\ntional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and noth­\ning in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon,\nlimit, or abridge those rights.” 99 Stat. 1873. Construing\nArticle 7(F) to authorize monetary sanctions would violate\nthis provision, since the primeval sovereign right is im­\nmunity from levies against the government fisc. See, e.g.,\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 750–751 (1999).\n   Finally, a comparison of the Compact’s terms with those\nof “[o]ther interstate compacts, approved by Congress\ncontemporaneously,” Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554,\n565 (1983), confirms that Article 7(F) does not authorize\nmonetary sanctions. At the same time Congress consented\nto this Compact, it consented to three other interstate\ncompacts that expressly authorize their commissions to\nimpose monetary sanctions against the parties to the\ncompacts. See Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioac­\ntive Waste Management Compact, Art. IV(i)(14), 99 Stat.\n1915 (hereinafter Northeast Compact); Central Midwest\nInterstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art.\nVIII(f), 99 Stat. 1891 (hereinafter Central Midwest Com­\npact); Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste\nCompact, Art. VII(e), 99 Stat. 1870 (hereinafter Central\nCompact). The Compact “clearly lacks the features of\nthese other compacts, and we are not free to rewrite it” to\nempower the Commission to impose monetary sanctions.\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 565.\n10              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                            B\n\n  Because the Compact does not authorize the Commis­\nsion to impose monetary sanctions, Plaintiffs’ second\nexception—that North Carolina could not avoid monetary\nsanctions by withdrawing from the Compact—is moot.\nThe third exception also pertains to the Commission’s\nsanctions resolution: that North Carolina forfeited its\nright to object to a monetary penalty by failing to partici­\npate at the sanctions hearing. Plaintiffs have failed to\nargue this exception. They have merely noted that North\nCarolina refused to participate at the sanctions hearing,\nand have cited no law in support of the proposition that\nthis was a forfeit. We deem the exception abandoned. It\nwas wisely abandoned, because it is meritless. North\nCarolina opposed the sanctions resolution and denied that\nthe Commission had jurisdiction to impose sanctions\nagainst it.\n                               C\n  Plaintiffs next take exception to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation that no binding effect or even deference\nbe accorded to the Commission’s conclusion that North\nCarolina violated Article 5(C) of the Compact. We are\nbound by the Commission’s conclusion of breach only if\nthere is “an explicit provision or other clear indicatio[n]” in\nthe Compact making the Commission the “sole arbiter of\ndisputes” regarding a party State’s compliance with the\nCompact. Id., at 569–570. Plaintiffs assert there is such a\nprovision, the second sentence of Article 7(C), which\nstates: “The Commission is the judge of the qualifications\nof the party [S]tates and of its members and of their com­\npliance with the conditions and requirements of this com­\npact and the laws of the party [S]tates relating to the\nenactment of this compact.” 99 Stat. 1879.\n  Plaintiffs greatly overread this provision. The limited\nnature of the authority to “judge” that it confers upon the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission is clear from its context. The first sentence of\nArticle 7(C) states that an eligible State “shall be de­\nclared” a party State “upon enactment of this compact into\nlaw by the [S]tate and upon [the] payment of” a $25,000\nfee, as “required by Article 4(H)(1).” Ibid. The second\nsentence makes the Commission the “judge” of four mat­\nters, all of which concern status as a party State or Com\nmission member. First, the Commission is the judge of the\n“qualifications” of a State to become a party State (the\nqualifications set forth in Article 7(A) for the initial party\nStates and in Article 7(B) for States that subsequently\npetition to join). Second, the Commission is the judge of\nthe qualifications of the members of the Commission,\nwhich are specified in Article 4(A). Third, the Commission\nis the judge of a party State’s compliance with the “condi­\ntions” and “requirements” of the Compact. The former\nterm is an obvious reference to Article 7(B): “The Commis­\nsion may establish such conditions as it deems necessary\nand appropriate to be met by a [S]tate wishing . . . to\nbecome a party [S]tate to this [C]ompact.” Id., at 1878.\nThe accompanying term “requirements” also refers to\nArticle 7’s prescriptions for prospective party States, such\nas paying the “fees required” under Article 7(C), id., at\n1879, and obtaining, as Article 7(B) requires, a two-thirds\nvote of the Commission in favor of admission. Finally, the\nCommission is the judge of the “laws of the party [S]tates\nrelating to the enactment of this compact.” Art. 7(C), ibid.\nAgain, that concerns status as a party State, which re­\nquires that the State “enac[t] . . . this compact into law,”\nibid. The Commission is the “judge” of only these specific\nmatters.\n   This is not to say the Commission lacks authority to\ninterpret the Compact or to say whether a party State has\nviolated its terms. That is of course implicit in its power\nto sanction under Article 7(F). But because “the express\nterms of the [Southeast] Compact do not constitute the\n12             ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission as the sole arbiter” regarding North Caro­\nlina’s compliance with its obligations under the Compact,\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 569, we are not bound\nto follow the Commission’s findings.\n   Plaintiffs argue that we nonetheless owe deference to\nthe Commission’s conclusion. But unless the text of an\ninterstate compact directs otherwise, we do not review the\nactions of a compact commission “on the deferential model\nof judicial review of administrative action by a federal\nagency.” Id., at 566–567. The terms of this Compact do\nnot establish that “this suit may be maintained only as\none for judicial review of the Commission’s” determination\nof breach. Id., at 567. Accordingly, we do not apply ad­\nministrative-law standards of review, but exercise our\nindependent judgment as to both fact and law in executing\nour role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controversies between\nthe States, §1251(a).\n                              D\n  Plaintiffs’ next two exceptions are to the Special Mas­\nter’s recommendations to deny their motion for summary\njudgment on their breach-of-contract claims, and to grant\nNorth Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on those\nclaims. In resolving motions for summary judgment in\ncases within our original jurisdiction, we are not techni­\ncally bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but\nwe use Rule 56 as a guide. This Court’s Rule 17.2; Ne\nbraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584, 590 (1993). Hence,\nsummary judgment is appropriate where there “is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact” and the moving\nparty is “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S.\n317, 322 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S.\n242, 248 (1986).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010) \n         13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               1\n\n   Plaintiffs claim North Carolina breached the Compact in\nDecember 1997, when (as it admits) it ceased all efforts\ntoward obtaining a license. At that point, in their view,\nNorth Carolina was no longer “tak[ing] appropriate steps\nto ensure that an application for a license to construct and\noperate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is\nfiled with and issued by the appropriate authority,” Art.\n5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. North Carolina says that once the\nCommission ceased providing financial assistance on\nDecember 1, and once it became clear there was insuffi­\ncient funding to complete the licensing phase, there were\nno more “appropriate” steps to take. The Special Master\nconcluded that the phrase “appropriate steps” in Article\n5(C) was ambiguous, and that the parties’ course of per­\nformance established that North Carolina was not re­\nquired to take steps toward obtaining a license once it was\nmade to bear the remaining financial burden of the licens­\ning phase. Second Report 10–24, 35–36. Plaintiffs take\nexception to that conclusion.\n   Article 5(C) does not require North Carolina to take any\nand all steps to license a regional-disposal facility; only\nthose that are “appropriate.” Plaintiffs contend that this\nrequires North Carolina to take the steps set forth in the\nregulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission govern­\ning the filing and disposition of applications for licenses to\noperate radioactive waste disposal facilities, 10 CFR pt. 61\n(1997). Those regulations set forth some, but certainly not\nall, of the “steps” the State would have to take to obtain a\nlicense. But Article 5(C) does not incorporate the regula­\ntions by reference, much less describe them as the appro\npriate steps.\n   We could accept Plaintiffs’ contention if “appropriate”\nmeant “necessary” (the steps set forth in the regulation\nare assuredly necessary to obtaining a license). But it\ndoes not. Whether a particular step is “appropriate”—\n14             ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“[s]pecially suitable; fit; proper,” Webster’s Second 133—\ncould depend upon many factors other than its mere in­\ndispensability to obtaining a license. It would not be\nappropriate, for example, to take a step whose cost greatly\nexceeded whatever benefits the license would confer, or if\nit was highly uncertain the license would ever issue.\n   In determining whether, in terminating its efforts to\nobtain a license, North Carolina failed to take what the\nparties considered “appropriate” steps, the parties’ course\nof performance under the Compact is highly significant.\nSee, e.g., New Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 830–831\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §§202(4), 203 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement).\nThat firmly establishes that North Carolina was not ex­\npected to go it alone—to proceed with the very expensive\nlicensing process without any external financial assis­\ntance. The history of the Compact consists entirely of\nshared financial burdens. From the beginning, North\nCarolina made clear that it required financial assistance\nto do the extensive work required for obtaining a license.\nThe Commission promptly declared it was “appropriate\nand necessary” to assist North Carolina with the costs.\nApp. 63. It provided the vast majority of funding for li­\ncensing-related activities—$80 million, compared to North\nCarolina’s $34 million. The Commission repeatedly noted\nthe necessity (and propriety) of providing financial assis­\ntance to North Carolina, and reiterated its dedication to\nsharing the substantial financial burdens of the licensing\nphase. See, e.g., id., at 63, 71, 145. There is nothing to\nsupport the proposition that the other States had an obli­\ngation under the Compact to share the licensing costs\nthrough the Commission; but we doubt that they did so\nout of love for the Tarheel State. They did it, we think,\nbecause that was their understanding of how the Compact\nwas supposed to work. One must take the Commission at\nits word, that it was “appropriate” to share the cost—\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich suggests that it would not have been appropriate to\nmake North Carolina proceed on its own.\n   Nor was North Carolina required after December 19,\n1997, to continue to expend its own funds at the same\nlevel it had previously (which Plaintiffs concede had satis­\nfied North Carolina’s obligation to take “appropriate\nsteps”). Once the Commission refused to provide any\nfurther financial assistance, North Carolina would have\nhad to assume an unlimited financial commitment to cover\nall remaining licensing costs. Even if it maintained its\nprior rate of appropriations going forward, it would not\nhave come close to covering the at least $34 million needed\nfor the last steps of the licensing phase. And since the\nincome from the South Carolina facility had been termi­\nnated, there was no apparent prospect of funding for the\nconstruction phase (expected to cost at least $75 million).\nIn connection with its August 1997 refusal to provide\nfurther assistance, the Commission itself had said, “[I]t\nwill be imprudent to continue to deplete Commission\nresources for this purpose if a source of funds is not estab­\nlished soon for the ultimate completion of the project.” Id.,\nat 306, 307; Joint Supp. Fact Brief App. 36, 37. And in\nMarch 1998, the Commission “strongly” reiterated that “it\nwould be imprudent to spend additional funds for licens­\ning activities if funds will not be available to complete the\nproject.” Id., at 59. What was imprudent for the Commis­\nsion would surely have been imprudent (and hence inap­\npropriate) for North Carolina as well. The State would\nhave wasted millions of its taxpayers’ dollars on what\nseemed to be a futile effort.\n   JUSTICE BREYER would uphold Plaintiffs’ challenge on\nthis point. He believes that the Compact obligated North\nCarolina to fund and complete the licensing and construc­\ntion of a nuclear waste facility. Post, at 2, 4–6 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). In fact, how­\never, North Carolina was not even contractually required\n16                 ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto “secur[e] a license,” post, at 2, but only to take “appro­\npriate steps” to obtain one, Art. 5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. And\nnothing in the terms of the Compact required North Caro­\nlina either to provide “adequate funding” for or to “beg[i]n\nconstruction” on a regional facility, post, at 2. Other con­\ntemporaneously enacted interstate compacts expressly\nprovide that the host State is “responsible for the timely\ndevelopment” of a regional facility, Central Midwest Com­\npact, Art. VI(f), 99 Stat. 1887; Midwest Compact,\nArt. VI(e), id., at 1898, or “shall . . . [c]ause a regional\nfacility to be developed on a timely basis,” Rocky Mountain\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art. III(d)(i), id.,\nat 1903–1904. But the compact here before us has no such\nprovision, and the contrast is telling.1 Texas v. New Mex\nico, 462 U. S., at 565. Moreover, the Commission’s state­\nments described in the preceding paragraph, that it would\nbe imprudent to commit additional resources “ ‘if a source\nof funds is not established soon for the ultimate comple­\ntion of the project,’ ” or “ ‘if funds will not be available to\ncomplete the project,’ ” surely suggest that North Carolina\nis not committed to the funding by contract.\n   JUSTICE BREYER asserts, post, at 4–5, that the rotating­\n\n——————\n   1 The Compact provides only that the host State is “responsible for\n\nthe availability . . . of their regional facilities in accordance with”\nArticle 5(B). Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873–1874. The latter section makes\nclear that responsibility for “availability” does not mean that the host\nState will fund construction of the facility, but that it will keep it open\nand not impose unreasonable restrictions on its use. JUSTICE BREYER is\ncorrect that the Compact says the Commission is not “responsible” for\nthe costs of “the creation” of a regional facility. Art. 4(K)(1), id., at\n1876. But what is important here is that it does not say that the host\nState is responsible—which (if it were true) would almost certainly\nhave been joined with saying who was not responsible. What JUSTICE\nBREYER overlooks is the possibility that no one is responsible, and the\nlicensing and construction of the facility is meant to depend upon\nvoluntary funding by interested parties, such as the party States, the\nCommission, and low-level radioactive waste generators.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhost requirement in the Compact, see Art. 5(A), 99 Stat.\n1873, necessarily implies that North Carolina is solely\nresponsible for the licensing and construction costs of its\nfacility. But all that requirement entails is that a party\nState “shall not be designated” as a host State for a second\ntime before “each [other] party [S]tate” has taken a turn.\nIbid. It can perfectly well envision that the States will\ntake turns in bearing the lead responsibility for getting\nthe facility licensed, supervising its construction, and\noperating the facility on its soil. In fact, that is just what\nits text suggests, since it describes the responsibility that\nis to be rotated as the host State’s “obligation . . . to have a\nregional facility operated within its borders.” Ibid. Not to\nconstruct it, or pay for its construction, but to “have [it]\noperated within its borders.” As noted above, other con­\ntemporaneously enacted compacts do spell out the obliga­\ntion of the host State to construct the facility. Still others\nat least provide that the host State will recoup its costs\nthrough disposal fees—which arguably suggests that the\nhost State is to bear the costs. See, e.g., Central Compact,\nArt. III(d),    99    Stat.  1865;     Northeast       Compact,\nArt. III(c)(2), id., at 1913. The compact before us here\ndoes not even contain that arguable suggestion.\n   What it comes down to, then, is JUSTICE BREYER’s intui­\ntion that the whole point of the Compact was that each\ndesignated host State would bear the up-front costs of\nlicensing and construction, but would eventually recoup\nthose costs through its regional monopoly on the disposal\nof low-level radioactive waste. Post, at 5–6. He can cite no\nprovision in the Compact which reflects such an under­\nstanding, and the behavior of the parties contradicts it.2 It\n——————\n  2 The course-of-dealing evidence that JUSTICE BREYER identifies, post,\n\nat 6–7, is not probative. The Commission’s statements that it is not\nlegally responsible for costs and that at some point Commission funds\nwill no longer be available, and North Carolina’s assurances that it will\nkeep its commitments and honor its obligations, are perfectly compati­\n18                 ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould, moreover, have been a foolish understanding, since\nthe regional monopoly to recoup construction costs would\nnot be a monopoly if South Carolina withdrew and contin­\nued to operate its facility—which is exactly what hap­\npened in 1995.3 Even leaving aside the principle, dis­\ncussed infra, at 21, that implied obligations are not to be\nread into interstate compacts, JUSTICE BREYER’s intuition\nfails to reflect the reality of what was implied.\n                              2\n   Plaintiffs take exception to the Special Master’s rejec­\ntion of their alternative argument that North Carolina\nrepudiated the Compact when it announced it would not\ntake further steps toward obtaining a license. They argue\nthat North Carolina’s announcement that it was shutting\ndown the project constituted a refusal to tender any fur­\nther performance under the contract.\n   Plaintiffs’ repudiation theory fails for the same reasons\ntheir breach theory fails. A repudiation occurs when an\nobligor either informs an obligee “that the obligor will\n——————\nble with the proposition that North Carolina did not have to provide all\nfunding for licensing the facility, and that it would be “inappropriate” to\nproceed toward obtaining a license for a facility that would never be\nneeded or built.\n  3 South Carolina’s withdrawal from the Compact not only “could”\n\naffect North Carolina’s ability to recoup its facility costs, as JUSTICE\nBREYER grudgingly concedes, post, at 5; it unquestionably would. With\na regional competitor in the Barnwell facility and declining demand for\nwaste disposal facilities due to technological and other factors, App.\n261, 263–264, North Carolina would receive significantly lower reve­\nnues from its facility, id., at 261–262, 265. The document attached to a\n1996 letter from North Carolina to the Commission trumpeting “$600\nmillion in cost savings” that would come from a new facility, post, at 5,\nproves precisely the opposite of what JUSTICE BREYER thinks. The cost\nsavings were to accrue “to all generators” of waste, App. 266 (emphasis\nadded)—that is, those who would use North Carolina’s facility. Those\nsavings would come, of course, from lower costs for waste disposal,\nwhich means that North Carolina would be charging lower rates than\nthe Barnwell facility (and thus receiving lower revenues).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Neither event occurred here.\nNorth Carolina never informed the Commission (or any\nparty State) that it would not fulfill its Article 5(C) obliga­\ntion to take appropriate steps toward obtaining a license.\nRather, it refused to take further steps that were not\nappropriate. Nor did North Carolina take an affirmative\nact that rendered it unable to perform. To the contrary, it\ncontinued to fund the Authority for almost two years; it\nmaintained the records of the Authority; and it preserved\nthe work completed to date while waiting for alternative\nfunding sources that would enable resumption of the\nproject. Plaintiffs further argue that a repudiation was\neffected by North Carolina’s refusal to take further steps\ntoward licensing “except on conditions which go beyond”\nthe terms of the Compact, Restatement §250, Comment b\n(internal quotation marks omitted)—i.e., the provision of\nexternal-financial assistance. But, as we have discussed,\nexternal-financial assistance was contemplated by the\nCompact.\n                              E\n   Plaintiffs’ final exception is to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation to deny their motion for summary judg­\nment, and to grant North Carolina’s cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, on their claim that North Carolina\nviolated the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing\nwhen it withdrew from the Compact in July 1999. Plain­\ntiffs concede that North Carolina could withdraw from the\nCompact, but contend it could not do so in “bad faith.”\nAnd, they assert, its withdrawal after accepting $80 mil­\nlion from the Commission, and with monetary sanctions\npending against it, was the epitome of bad faith.\n20                ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have never held that an interstate compact approved\nby Congress includes an implied duty of good faith and\nfair dealing. Of course “[e]very contract imposes upon\neach party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its\nperformance and enforcement.” Restatement §205. But\nan interstate compact is not just a contract; it is a federal\nstatute enacted by Congress. If courts were authorized to\nadd a fairness requirement to the implementation of\nfederal statutes, judges would be potent lawmakers in­\ndeed. We do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal\nstatute. See, e.g., Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503\nU. S. 249, 254 (1992). And in that regard a statute which\nis a valid interstate compact is no different. Texas v. New\nMexico, 462 U. S., at 564, 565. We are especially reluctant\nto read absent terms into an interstate compact given the\nfederalism and separation-of-powers concerns that would\narise were we to rewrite an agreement among sovereign\nStates, to which the political branches consented. As we\nhave said before, we will not “ ‘order relief inconsistent\nwith [the] express terms’ ” of a compact, “no matter what\nthe equities of the circumstances might otherwise invite.”\nNew Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S., at 811 (quoting Texas\nv. New Mexico, supra, at 564).\n   The Compact imposes no limitation on North Carolina’s\nexercise of its statutory right to withdraw. Under Article\n7(G), which governed North Carolina’s withdrawal,4 “any\nparty [S]tate may withdraw from the compact by enacting\na law repealing the compact.” 99 Stat. 1879. There is no\nrestriction upon a party State’s enactment of such a law,\n——————\n  4 After North Carolina was designated as a host State, the Compact\n\nwas amended to add Article 7(H), which restricted the ability of a party\nState to withdraw to within 30 days after a second regional-disposal\nfacility opened. Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste\nCompact Amendments Consent Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101–171, §2, 103\nStat. 1289.

S. ____ (2010)          21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand nothing in the Compact suggests the parties under­\nstood there were “certain purposes for which the expressly\nconferred power . . . could not be employed.” Tymshare,\nInc. v. Covell, 727 F. 2d 1145, 1153 (CADC 1984) (opinion\nfor the court by Scalia, J.). Moreover, Article 3 ensures\nthat no such restrictions may be implied, since it provides\nthat the Compact shall not be “construed to infringe upon,\nlimit or abridge” the sovereign rights of a party State.\n   A comparison of the Compact with other, contemporane­\nously enacted, compacts confirms there is no such limita­\ntion on North Carolina’s right to withdraw. See Texas v.\nNew Mexico, supra, at 565. In contrast to the Compact,\nseveral other compacts concerning the creation of regional\nfacilities for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste\ncontain express good-faith limitations upon a State’s\nexercise of its rights.      See, e.g., Central Compact,\nArt. III(f), 99 Stat. 1865; Central Midwest Compact,\nArt. V(a), id., at 1886; Midwest Interstate Low-Level\nRadioactive Waste Management Compact, Art.

North Carolina’s motion was\nbased on the ground that, as a matter of law, its obliga­\ntions are governed entirely by the Compact. The Special\nMaster recommended denying the motion without preju­\ndice, because the claims in Counts III–V “requir[e] further\nbriefing and argument, and possibly further discovery.”\n22                ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nSecond Report 41. A threshold question for all claims in\nthose Counts, for example, is whether they “belong to the\nCommission, the Plaintiff States, or both.” Ibid. Perhaps\nthe States can bring them in their capacity as parens\npatriae, but as the Special Master noted “the parties have\nnot adequately briefed this issue, and its resolution in this\ncase is unclear.” Id., at 42–43.\n  We think it was reasonable for the Special Master to\ndefer ruling. We granted the Special Master discretion to\n“direct subsequent proceedings” and “to submit such re­\nports as he may deem appropriate.” 540 U. S., at 1014.\nHe could have deferred filing any report until full factual\ndiscovery had been completed and all of the legal issues,\nmany of which are novel and challenging, had been fully\nbriefed, considered, and decided. Instead, he concluded\nthat our immediate resolution of Counts I and II would\nfacilitate the efficient disposition of the case; and in agree­\ning to hear exceptions to his Preliminary Report and\nSecond Report we implicitly agreed. His deferral of ruling\non the merits of Counts III–V is part and parcel of the\nsame case management, and we find no reason to upset it.\n                            B\n   North Carolina takes exception to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation in his Preliminary Report to deny with­\nout prejudice its motion to dismiss the Commission’s\nclaims on the ground that they are barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment to the Constitution and by structural princi­\nples of state sovereign immunity. The Special Master\nassumed for the sake of argument that a State possesses\nsovereign immunity against a claim brought by an entity,\nlike the Commission, created by an interstate compact,5\n——————\n  5 We have held that an entity created through a valid exercise of the\nInterstate Compact Clause is not entitled to immunity from suit under\nthe Eleventh Amendment, see Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson\nCorporation, 513 U. S. 30 (1994), but we have not decided whether such\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

But he recommended denying\nNorth Carolina’s motion to dismiss “at this point in the\nproceedings.” Ibid.\n  The Special Master relied upon our decision in Arizona\nv. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), which held that the\nEleventh Amendment did not bar the participation of\nseveral Indian Tribes in an original action concerning the\nallocation of rights to the waters of the Colorado River.\nThe United States had already intervened, in its capacity\nas trustee for several Indian Tribes; but the Tribes moved\nto intervene as well, and the States opposed. We granted\nthe Tribes’ motion, stating that the States do not enjoy\nsovereign immunity against the United States, and “[t]he\nTribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against\nthe States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudi­\ncation of their vital water rights that was commenced by\nthe United States.” Id., at 614. Thus, “our judicial power\nover the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to\nintervene, and the States’ sovereign immunity protected\nby the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.” Ibid.\nRelying on this holding, the Special Master held that\nsovereign immunity does not bar the Commission’s suit, so\nlong as the Commission asserts the same claims and seeks\nthe same relief as the other plaintiffs. Whether that is so,\nhe said, “cannot be resolved without further factual and\nlegal development[s],” Preliminary Report 6, and so North\nCarolina is free to renew its motion at a later point, id., at\n13–14. See Second Report 45–48.\n Assuming (as the Special Master did) that the Commis­\nsion’s claims against North Carolina implicate sovereign\nimmunity, we agree with his disposition. North Carolina\ncontends that making application of the Constitution’s\nwaiver of sovereign immunity turn upon whether a\nnonsovereign party seeks to expand the relief sought is\n—————— \n\nan entity’s suit against a State is barred by sovereign immunity. \n\n24                ALABAMA v.

California has been implic­\nitly overruled.6 See Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long\nTerm Care, Inc., 529 U. S. 1, 18 (2000). Neither of them\narose under our original jurisdiction, and neither cited\nArizona v. California or discussed—at all—the sovereign\nimmunity issue that case addressed. That sovereign\nimmunity is a personal privilege of the States says noth­\ning about whether that privilege “is not compromised,”\nArizona v.

California\ncannot apply to the Commission’s claims, because the\nCommission does not—indeed, cannot—assert the same\nclaims or seek the same relief as the plaintiff States. We\ndisagree.

In neither case\nwere there entirely overlapping claims for relief between sovereign and\nnonsovereign plaintiffs. See Pennhurst, supra, at 103, n. 12. Indeed, in\nCounty of Oneida there was no sovereign plaintiff.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

See\nArizona v. California, supra, at 614. The Commission is\n“a legal entity separate and distinct from” the States that\nare parties to the Compact. Art. 4(M)(1), 99 Stat. 1877.\nSince it is not a party it has neither a contractual right to\nperformance by the party States nor enforceable statutory\nrights under Article 5 of the Compact, see Bennett v.\nSpear, 520 U. S. 154, 162–163 (1997). The Compact does,\nhowever, authorize the Commission to “act or appear on\nbehalf of any party [S]tate or [S]tates . . . as an intervenor\nor party in interest before . . . any court of law,” Art.\n4(E)(10), 99 Stat. 1875, and it is obviously in this capacity\nthat the Commission seeks to vindicate the plaintiff\nStates’ statutory and contractual rights in Counts I and II.\nIts Count I and Count II claims therefore rise or fall with\nthe claims of the States. While the Commission may not\nbring them in a stand-alone action under this Court’s\noriginal jurisdiction, see §1251(a), it may assert them in\n26             ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis Court alongside the plaintiff States, see Arizona v.\nCalifornia, 460 U. S., at 614. The summary judgment\ndisallowing the underlying claims on their merits renders\nthe sovereign immunity question with regard to any relief\nthe Commission alone might have on those claims moot.\n  Counts III–V, which do not rely upon the Compact,\nstand on a different footing. As to them, while the Com­\nmission again seemingly makes the same claims and seeks\nthe same relief as the States, it is conceivable that as a\nmatter of law the Commission’s claims are not identical.\nThe Commission can claim restitution as the party that\npaid the money to North Carolina; the other plaintiffs\ncannot claim it on that basis. Whether this means that\nthe claims are not identical for Arizona v. California pur­\nposes, and that the Commission’s Counts III–V claims\nmust be dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, is a\nquestion that the Special Master declined to resolve until\nthe merits issues were further clarified. We have ap­\nproved his deferral of those issues, and we likewise ap­\nprove his deferral of the related sovereign immunity issue.\n                        *    *    *\n  We overrule the exceptions of Plaintiffs and North\nCarolina to the Special Master’s Reports, and we adopt the\nrecommendations of the Special Master.

Rather, plaintiffs’ argu\nment is that the Compact’s terms, properly construed,\nspeak not only to the specific duties imposed upon the\nparties but also to the manner in which those duties must\nbe carried out. This is an interpretive argument familiar\nto contract disputes. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §205 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement).\n   As the opinion for the Court notes, congressional con\nsent to an interstate compact gives it the status of a fed\neral statute. See ante, at 20. This is an apt and proper\nway to indicate that a compact has all the dignity of an\nAct of Congress. And that is surely what was meant in\nNew Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 811 (1998), where\nit was stated that the Court may not “ ‘order relief incon\nsistent with [the] express terms’ ” of a compact. Ante, at\n20 (quoting New Jersey; alteration in original; some inter\n2              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nnal quotation marks omitted); see also Cuyler v. Adams,\n449 U. S. 433, 438 (1981) (“[C]ongressional consent trans\nforms an interstate compact . . . into a law of the United\nStates”).\n  From this principle, however, it simply does not follow\nthat a law’s nature and origin as a compact must be dis\nmissed as irrelevant. Like a treaty, a compact represents\nan agreement between parties. See New Jersey, supra, at\n831 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Compact here is of\ncourse a treaty”). The Court’s duty in interpreting a com\npact involves ascertaining the intent of the parties. See\nSullivan v. Kidd, 254 U. S. 433, 439 (1921) (“[T]reaties are\nto be interpreted upon the principles which govern the\ninterpretation of contracts . . . with a view to making\neffective the purposes of the high contracting parties”);\nWright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 40, 57 (1903) (“Treaties must\nreceive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of\nthe contracting parties”). Carrying out this duty may lead\nthe Court to consult sources that might differ from those\nnormally reviewed when an ordinary federal statute is at\nissue. That much is surely implicit in the Court’s refer\nence to contract law principles elsewhere in its opinion in\nthe instant case. See, e.g., ante, at 14 (“[T]he parties’\ncourse of performance under the Compact is highly signifi\ncant”); ibid. (citing the Restatement); id., at 18–19 (same);\nsee also New Jersey, supra, at 830–831 (SCALIA, J., dis\nsenting) (construing a compact in light of “hornbook con\ntracts law that the practical construction of an ambiguous\nagreement revealed by later conduct of the parties is good\nindication of its meaning”).\n  That said, it is quite correct to hold here that the rea\nsonable expectations of the contracting States, as mani\nfested in the Compact, do not reveal an intent to limit\nNorth Carolina’s power of withdrawal. For purposes of\nrejecting this argument, it is sufficient to note—as the\nCourt does—that the Compact permits any State to with\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

One of these things is not like the others: The Com\nmission is not a sovereign State. The Court entertains its\nsuit—despite North Carolina’s sovereign immunity—\nbecause the Commission “asserts the same claims and\nseeks the same relief as the other plaintiffs.” Ante, at 23.\nOur Constitution does not countenance such “no harm, no\nfoul” jurisdiction, and I respectfully dissent.\n   The Court has made this mistake before. In Arizona v.\nCalifornia, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), we allowed Indian Tribes\nthat could not sue sovereign States to piggyback on the\nclaims of the United States, which could. We reasoned\nthat once the United States had initiated suit, the state\ndefendants could “no longer . . . assert [their] immunity\nwith respect to the subject matter of [the] action,” so the\nTribes were free to pile on and join the suit. Id., at 614.\nToday the Court retraces Arizona’s steps, quoting that\ncase for the proposition that when private plaintiffs “ ‘do\n2              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nnot seek to bring new claims or issues, . . . our judicial\npower over the controversy is not enlarged . . . , and the\nStates’ sovereign immunity protected by the Eleventh\nAmendment is not compromised.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting\nArizona, supra, at 614).\n  That statement is contrary to the language of the Con\nstitution. The Eleventh Amendment provides:\n      “The Judicial power of the United States shall not\n    be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,\n    commenced or prosecuted against one of the United\n    States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or\n    Subjects of any Foreign State.”\nThe immunity conferred is against the “commence[ment]\nor prosecut[ion]” of “any suit in law or equity.” There is no\ncarve-out for suits “prosecuted” by private parties so long\nas those parties “ ‘do not seek to bring new claims or is\nsues.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting Arizona, supra, at 614).\n   Understandably, the Court’s opinion leans heavily on\nArizona, which has never been squarely overruled. Ante,\nat 23–24. But Arizona itself is built on sand. The relevant\nportion of that opinion is almost wholly unreasoned. It\ncites only a footnote in a prior case, the pertinent para\ngraph of which failed even to discuss the State’s immunity\nfrom private suit. See 460 U. S., at 614 (citing Maryland\nv. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 745, n. 21 (1981)). That para\ngraph addressed only intervention, not sovereign immu\nnity, and the two issues are distinct. See South Carolina\nv. North Carolina, 558 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5 (2010) (slip op.,\nat 10, n. 5).\n   Most importantly, the subsequent development of our\nsovereign immunity jurisprudence has only undermined\nArizona’s already weak foundations. We recognized in\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 718 (1999), that the Consti\ntution left intact the States’ pre-existing “immunity from\nprivate suits”; as the Eleventh Amendment confirms, the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

Hamilton)); see also\nAlden, supra, at 718–722, 755–756. There is no reason to\nsuppose that the States, at the founding, made an excep\ntion for private suits that happen to mimic other plaintiffs’\nclaims—and neither Arizona nor the Court today suggests\notherwise.\n   Whether or not a plaintiff “seeks the same relief” or\nimposes any “additional defense or liability,” ante, at 23–\n24, simply does not matter in light of our recognition that\nsovereign immunity provides an “immunity from suit,” not\na “defense to . . . liability.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.\nSouth Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002).\nAs we have explained, “the relief sought by a plaintiff\nsuing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit\nis barred.” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44,\n58 (1996). Indeed, we have suggested that private parties\nmay not sue even if a court is “precluded . . . from award\ning them any relief.” Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at\n766 (emphasis added) (dictum). It is the fact that a pri\nvate party is allowed to sue a sovereign State—not the\nburden of litigation or the relief sought—that infringes the\nimmunity of the State. “The Eleventh Amendment is\nconcerned not only with the States’ ability to withstand\nsuit, but with their privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico\nAqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.,\n506 U. S. 139, 147, n. 5 (1993).\n   It is therefore impossible for the Court to hear private\nclaims against a nonconsenting State without expanding\n“our judicial power over the controversy.” Arizona, supra,\nat 614. Sovereign immunity is a limitation on that power.\nThe similarity of claims may be relevant to joinder or\nintervention, but those are procedural means of processing\nclaims, not fonts of judicial authority. See Henderson v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 654, 664 (1996).\n4                 ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   Nor may the Court entertain private claims without\n“compromis[ing]” “the States’ sovereign immunity.” Ari\nzona, 460 U. S., at 614. As a party, the Commission enjoys\nlegally enforceable rights against the defendant State: It\nmay object to settlement, seek taxation of costs, advance\narguments we are obliged to consider, and plead the\njudgment as res judicata in future litigation. If the Com\nmission truly sought nothing for itself—other than “a full\nexposition of the issues,” Preliminary Report of the Special\nMaster 14—it could have participated as an amicus.\n   The Commission and North Carolina know that more is\nat stake if the Commission is allowed to sue the State. It\nis precisely the Commission’s status as a party, its attempt\nto “prosecut[e]” a “suit in law or equity . . . against one of\nthe United States,” U. S.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\nON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS\n               OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                         [June 1, 2010]\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  I join Parts I, II–A, II–B, and III of the Court’s opinion.\nUnlike the Court, however, I believe that North Carolina\nbreached the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive\nWaste Management Compact (Compact) when it sus­\npended its efforts toward building a waste disposal facility.\n(THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins all but Parts II–D and III–B of\nthe Court’s opinion.)\n  Article 5(C) is the critical term of the Compact. It states:\n    “Each party state designated as a host state for a re­\n    gional facility shall take appropriate steps to ensure\n    that an application for a license to construct and op­\n    erate a facility . . . is filed with and issued by the ap­\n    propriate authority.” Omnibus Low-Level Radioactive\n    Waste Interstate Compact Consent Act (Consent Act),\n    99 Stat. 1877.\nIn September 1986, North Carolina was “designated as a\nhost state for a regional” low-level nuclear waste disposal\n“facility.” Ibid.; see also App. 417, 432. Soon thereafter,\nNorth Carolina’s General Assembly enacted legislation\n2               ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nauthorizing a state agency to “site, finance, [and] build” a\nwaste disposal facility. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G–4 (1987)\n(repealed 2000). Pursuant to this legislation, a new facil­\nity was to be completed by January 1, 1993. Ibid.\n   From August 1987 until December 1997, North Carolina\ntook a series of steps to prepare for the construction of the\nstorage facility. See Brief for North Carolina in Support of\nExceptions to Reports of the Special Master 6–8. And\nwhile doing so it continually assured its Compact partners\nthat it “remain[ed] committed to fulfilling its obligations to\nthe Compact to serve as the next host state.” App. 92\n(Letter from James G. Martin, Governor of North Caro­\nlina, to Carroll R. Campbell, Jr., Governor of South Caro­\nlina (October 25, 1990)); Statement of Undisputed Mate­\nrial Facts ¶¶24–26, 28, 33, 37, 39 (detailing press releases,\ngubernatorial letters, and other statements made by\nNorth Carolina expressing its commitment to its Compact\nobligations).\n   But North Carolina never secured a license, never ob­\ntained adequate funding, and never began construction on\na new facility. See Second Report of Special Master 2–3\n(hereinafter Second Report). Eventually, the State simply\nstopped trying: On December 19, 1997, North Carolina\ninformed its fellow member States that it would “com­\nmence the orderly shutdown” of the waste disposal “pro­\nject.” App. 319. After this point, North Carolina admit­\ntedly took no further steps toward obtaining a license or\nbuilding a facility before withdrawing from the Compact in\nJuly 1999.

S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nsee how the Court can find that a year and a half of doing\nnothing—which North Carolina admits it did between\nDecember 1997 and July 1999—constitutes “tak[ing]\nappropriate steps.” If a student promises to “take appro­\npriate steps to ensure” that he will pass the bar and then\nrefuses to study, has he not broken his promise? More to\nthe point, if a builder promises that he will “take appro­\npriate steps to ensure” that a customer will be able to\nmove into a new home in two years, and then does nothing\nat all, has the builder not broken his promise?\n   As the majority notes, “[o]ther contemporaneously en­\nacted interstate compacts” delineated a host State’s obli­\ngations in more detail than the Southeast Compact does.\nAnte, at 16–17. But this fact may just as easily be read to\nindicate what the parties here intended, rather than, as\nthe majority argues, what they did not intend. Regard­\nless, the language of the Compact and the context in which\nit was enacted—as part of a congressional effort to en­\ncourage regional solutions to this Nation’s low-level radio­\nactive waste problem, see Consent Act, 99 Stat. 1859; Low-\nLevel Radioactive Waste Policy Act, §4(a)(1), 94 Stat.\n3348—both indicate that North Carolina was supposed to\ntake “appropriate steps” to build a low-level radioactive\nwaste disposal facility. And North Carolina’s General\nAssembly passed a state statute recognizing and accepting\nthis responsibility. See N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G–4 (creating\na state agency to “site, finance, [and] build” a waste dis­\nposal facility). How can it be that two years of inactivity\nfollowed by withdrawal satisfies this promise?\n   The answer, says the Court, is that any further “appro­\npriate steps” would have cost a significant amount of\nmoney. Ante, at 14–15. In 1997, the Southeast Interstate\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission\n(Commission), the entity responsible for administering the\nCompact, made clear that it would not advance North\nCarolina any more money toward building a facility. See\n4               ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nApp. 315. In response, North Carolina concluded that it\nwas unwilling to fund the rest of the project itself. See id.,\nat 317–319. And the Court agrees that it would have been\n“imprudent” for North Carolina to spend further funds, in\nlight of the Commission’s refusal to do so also. Ante, at\n15–16.\n   But this is an odd excuse. If a builder promises to “take\nappropriate steps” to build me a house, the fact that he\nruns out of funds would not normally excuse his breaking\nhis promise—at least if it is he, and not I, who is responsi­\nble for financing the project. See 2 E. Farnsworth, Con­\ntracts §9.6, p. 638 (3d ed. 2004) (Farnsworth) (courts\n“generally” conclude that “additional expense” “does not\nrise to the level of impracticability” so as to excuse a party\nfrom performance). And here it is North Carolina, and not\nanyone else, who bears ultimate responsibility for finding\nthe funds.\n   The text, structure, and purpose of the Compact all\ndemonstrate this fact. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2,\nthe Compact expressly provides that the Commission “is\nnot responsible for any costs associated with . . . the crea­\ntion of any facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876. Rather,\nthe Compact States determined that each “party state”\nshould take a turn as the “host state,” during which time\nthat State would be obligated to build a facility and then\noperate it for 20 years. See Art. 3(A), id., at 1873; Art.\n5(A), id., at 1877; Art. 5(C), ibid.; Art. 5(E), 103 Stat. 1289;\nsee also Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873–1874 (“Host states are\nresponsible for the availability, the subsequent post­\nclosure observation and maintenance, and the extended\ninstitutional control of their regional facilities”). The host\nState would then recover its upfront construction expenses\nfrom the considerable fees and surcharges charged to the\nwaste generators served by the facility. N. C. Gen. Stat.\n§§104G–15(a)–(b) (repealed 2000) (“It is the intent of the\nGeneral Assembly that the cost of all activities [toward\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But, as far as I am aware, North Carolina did not\nseriously seek to amend the Compact when South Caro­\nlina departed (even though the State had sought and\nobtained an amendment previously, see ante, at 20, n. 4;\nBrief for North Carolina in Reply to Exceptions By Plain­\ntiffs to Reports of the Special Master 27), nor has it argued\nto this Court that South Carolina’s departure voided its\ncontractual obligations. Indeed, there is evidence in the\nrecord indicating that, even after South Carolina left the\nCompact, North Carolina continued to believe that the\noperation of a waste disposal facility presented a substan­\ntial financial opportunity. App. 255, 266 (Attachment to\nLetter from John H. MacMillan, Executive Director, North\nCarolina Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management\nAuthority, to Richard S. Hodes, M. D., Chairman, South­\neast Compact Commission (Dec. 13, 1996) (enclosing a\nbusiness plan identifying $600 million in cost savings that\ncould provide a “substantial return” on the “investment\nneeded to put the North Carolina facility into operation”)).\n   I thus cannot conclude, as the majority does, that the\nCompact’s rotational design, as I understand it, is “fool­\nish.” Ante, at 18. Rather, the Compact’s structure repre­\nsents what, in my view, was a understandable decision by\nthe contracting States, all of whom needed a waste dis­\nposal facility, to bind themselves together so that each\nwould take a turn “bear[ing] the cost of building” the\nnecessary facility. Preliminary Report of Special Master\n21 (citing Art. 4(K), 99 Stat. 1876–1877); see Brief for\n6              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nRocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact\nBoard et al. as Amici Curiae 16–18. This rotational ap­\nproach is surely a sensible solution to the problems caused\nby the widespread existence of low-level nuclear waste and\nthe political unpopularity of building the necessary facili­\nties to house it. See id., at 13–16; New York v. United\nStates, 505 U. S. 144, 149–151 (1992).\n   The only contrary evidence—i.e., that indicates that\nNorth Carolina did not bear ultimate funding responsibil­\nity—consists of the fact that the Commission voluntarily\nadvanced North Carolina nearly $80 million between 1988\nand 1998 in order to help it defray its costs. Second Re­\nport 16. The Court believes that this “course of perform­\nance” demonstrates that, once the Commission turned off\nits monetary spigot, North Carolina was no longer re­\nquired to do anything further. Ante, at 14–15. But why?\nIf I advance my builder half the cost of a building, I have\nnot thereby promised to advance him the whole cost. This\nis particularly true when the contract says I am responsi­\nble for none of the cost of the building. At the very least,\nsomething more in the circumstances would have to show\nthat additional expenditure had become a reasonable\nexpectation.\n   In this case, nothing suggests that North Carolina could\nreasonably expect further financing assistance. Indeed, I\ncan find nothing in the majority’s opinion, or the record,\nthat suggests that the Commission or the other Compact\nStates intended to let North Carolina off the hook. And\nnumerous documents indicate precisely the opposite—that\ndespite the Commission’s funding assistance, North Caro­\nlina was still responsible for funding the project. See, e.g.,\nApp. 63 (Resolution (Feb. 9, 1988) (“The Commission,\nalthough not obligated to do so under the Compact,” pro­\nvides funding for North Carolina)); id., at 215 (Letter from\nRichard S.

And North Carolina\nadmittedly took no steps towards building a disposal facil­\nity from December 1997 and July 1999: It did no in-depth\nstudy of the further financing that might be necessary; it\nmade no serious effort to look for alternative funding; the\nExecutive of the State did not ask its legislature for any\nappropriation. Rather, North Carolina simply withdrew\nfrom the Compact. Ante, at 5.\n   Of course, North Carolina was free to withdraw from the\nCompact. Art. 7(G), 99 Stat. 1879–1880. But that fact\ndoes not repair what, in my view, was a breach of a key\ncontractual provision. See Franconia Associates v. United\nStates, 536 U.

NORTH CAROLINA\n\nON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS\n               OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n\n    No. 132, Orig. Argued January 11, 2010—Decided June 1, 2010\nIn 1986, Congress granted its consent to the Southeast Interstate Low-\n  Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact (Compact), which\n  was entered into by Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North\n  Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Compact is\n  administered by a Commission, which was required, inter alia, to\n  “identif[y] a host State for the development of a [new] regional\n  disposal facility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is licensed\n  and ready to operate . . . no . . . later than 1991.” Art. 4(E)(6), 99\n  Stat. 1875. The Commission designated North Carolina as a host\n  State in 1986, thereby obligating North Carolina to take “appropriate\n  steps to ensure that an application for a license to construct and op\n  erate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is filed with and\n  issued by the appropriate authority.” Art. 5(C), id., at 1877.\n     In 1988, North Carolina asked the Commission for assistance with\n  the costs of licensing and building a facility. The Commission\n  adopted a resolution declaring it “appropriate and necessary” to pro\n  vide financial assistance, and ultimately paid almost $80 million to\n  North Carolina from 1988 through 1997. North Carolina also ex\n  pended $34 million of its own funds. Yet by the mid 1990s, North\n  Carolina was still many years—and many tens of millions of dol\n  lars—away from obtaining a license.\n     In 1997, the Commission notified North Carolina that absent a\n  plan for funding the remaining licensing steps, it would not disburse\n  additional funds to North Carolina. North Carolina responded that it\n  could not continue without additional funding. After the parties\n  failed to agree on a long-term financing plan, in December 1997 the\n  Commission ceased its financial assistance to North Carolina, and\n  North Carolina subsequently began an orderly shutdown of its pro\n2                   ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    ject.\n       In June 1999, Florida and Tennessee filed a complaint with the\n    Commission seeking monetary sanctions against North Carolina. In\n    July 1999, North Carolina exercised its right under Article 7(G) to\n    withdraw from the Compact. In December 1999, the Commission\n    concluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obligations un\n    der the Compact and adopted a sanctions resolution demanding that\n    the State repay approximately $80 million in addition to other mone\n    tary penalties. North Carolina did not comply.\n       In 2003, this Court granted Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia,\n    and the Commission (Plaintiffs) leave to file a bill of complaint\n    against North Carolina under this Court’s original jurisdiction, U. S.\n    Const., Art. II, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. §1251(a). The complaint sets\n    forth claims of violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Compact\n    (Count I), breach of contract (Count II), unjust enrichment (Count\n    III), promissory estoppel (Count IV), and money had and received\n    (Count V), and requests monetary and other relief, including a decla\n    ration that North Carolina is subject to sanctions and that the Com\n    mission’s sanctions resolution is valid and enforceable.\n       The Court assigned the case to a Special Master, who has con\n    ducted proceedings and has filed two reports. The Preliminary Re\n    port recommends denying without prejudice North Carolina’s motion\n    to dismiss the Commission’s claims on sovereign immunity grounds;\n    denying Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on Count I, which\n    sought enforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution; grant\n    ing North Carolina’s cross-motion to dismiss Count I and other por\n    tions of the complaint seeking such enforcement; and denying North\n    Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts II–V. The Master’s\n    Second Report recommended denying Plaintiff’s motion for summary\n    judgment and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary judg\n    ment on Count II; and denying North Carolina’s motion for summary\n    judgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims in Counts III–V. The par\n    ties filed a total of nine exceptions to the Master’s Reports.\nHeld:\n    1. Plaintiffs’ seven exceptions are overruled. Pp. 7–21.\n       (a) The terms of the Compact do not authorize the Commission to\n impose monetary sanctions against North Carolina. The Court’s con\n clusion is confirmed by a comparison of the Compact’s terms with\n three other interstate compacts concerning low-level radioactive\n waste storage approved by Congress contemporaneously with the\n Compact, all of which expressly authorize their commissions to im\n pose monetary sanctions against their party States. Pp. 7–9.\n       (b) Plaintiffs’ exception that North Carolina could not avoid\n monetary sanctions by withdrawing from the Compact is moot, be\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncause the Compact does not permit the Commission to impose mone\ntary sanctions in any event. The Court deems their exception that\nNorth Carolina forfeited its right to object to a monetary penalty by\nfailing to participate at the sanctions hearing both abandoned and\nmeritless. P. 10.\n      (c) Because the express terms of the Compact do not make the\nCommission the “sole arbiter” of disputes arising under the Compact,\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554, 569–570, the Court is not bound\nby the Commission’s conclusion that North Carolina breached its ob\nligations under the Compact. Nor does the Court apply deferential\nadministrative-law standards of review to the Commission’s conclu\nsion, but instead exercises its independent judgment as to both fact\nand law in executing its role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controver\nsies between the States, 28 U. S. C. §1251(a). Pp. 10–12.\n      (d) North Carolina did not breach its contractual obligation to\ntake “appropriate steps” toward the issuance of a license. Pp. 12–19.\n         (1) The Compact requires North Carolina to take only those li\ncensing steps that are “appropriate.” The parties’ course of perform\nance establishes that it was not appropriate for North Carolina to\nproceed with the very expensive licensing process without external\nfinancial assistance. Nothing in the Compact’s text or structure re\nquires North Carolina to cover all licensing and building costs on its\nown. Plaintiffs’ assertion that it was understood that the host State\nwould bear the up-front licensing and construction costs, but recoup\nthose costs through its regional monopoly on radioactive waste dis\nposal, is not reflected in the Compact. Pp. 13–18.\n         (2) Plaintiffs’ alternative argument that North Carolina repu\ndiated its obligation to take appropriate steps when it announced it\nwould take no further steps to obtain a license fails for the same rea\nsons their breach theory fails. Pp. 18–19.\n      (e) North Carolina did not breach an implied duty of good faith\nand fair dealing when it withdrew from the Compact. The Compact\nby its terms imposes no limitation on North Carolina’s right to exer\ncise its statutory right under Article 7(G) to withdraw from the Com\npact. A comparison between the Compact and other contemporane\nously enacted compacts confirms the absence of a good-faith\nlimitation in the Compact. Pp. 19–21.\n   2. North Carolina’s two exceptions are overruled. Pp. 21–26.\n      (a) It was reasonable for the Special Master to deny without\nprejudice North Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on the mer\nits of Plaintiffs’ equitable claims in Counts III–V. The Special Master\nconcluded that those claims require further briefing, argument, and,\npossibly, discovery. The Court approves of the Special Master’s rea\nsonable exercise of his discretion to manage the proceedings. Pp. 21–\n4                   ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    22.\n         (b) Under Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 614, the Commis\n    sion’s claims are not barred by sovereign immunity so long as the\n    Commission asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the\n    plaintiff States. Nothing in the Court’s subsequent cases suggests\n    that Arizona v. California has been implicitly overruled, and North\n    Carolina does not ask the Court to overrule that decision. At least\n    with respect to Counts I and II, the Commission’s claims under those\n    Compact-related Counts are wholly derivative of the plaintiff States’\n    claims. The summary judgment disallowing the claims in Counts I\n    and II on their merits renders the sovereign immunity question with\n    regard to any relief the Commission alone might have on those claims\n    moot. Counts III–V are on a different footing. The Special Master\n    concluded that further factual and legal development was necessary\n    to determine whether the Commission’s claims under these Counts\n    were identical to those of the plaintiff States. The Special Master’s\n    case-management decision was reasonable. Pp. 22–26.\nExceptions to Special Master’s Reports overruled, and Master’s recom\n  mendations adopted; North Carolina’s motions to dismiss Count I\n  and for summary judgment on Count II granted; Plaintiffs’ motions\n  for judgment on Counts I and II denied; and North Carolina’s mo\n  tions to dismiss the Commission’s claims on sovereign immunity\n  grounds and for summary judgment on Counts III–V denied without\n  prejudice.\n\n   SCALIA, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which STEVENS,\nGINSBURG, and ALITO, JJ., joined, in which ROBERTS, C.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA\n\nON EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRELIMINARY AND SECOND REPORTS\n               OF THE SPECIAL MASTER\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, which arises under our original jurisdiction,\nU. S. Const., Art. III, §2, cl. 2; 28 U. S. C. §1251(a), we\nconsider nine exceptions submitted by the parties to two\nreports filed by the Special Master.\n                             I\n   In 1986, Congress granted its consent under the Com­\npact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §10, cl. 3, to seven inter­\nstate compacts providing for the creation of regional facili­\nties to dispose of low-level radioactive waste. Omnibus\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Interstate Compact Consent\nAct, 99 Stat. 1859. One of those compacts was the South­\neast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management\nCompact (Compact), entered into by Alabama, Florida,\nGeorgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee, and Virginia. Id., at 1871–1880. That Com­\npact established an “instrument and framework for a\ncooperative effort” to develop new facilities for the long­\n2              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nterm disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated\nwithin the region. Art. 1, id., at 1872. The Compact was\nto be administered by a Southeast Interstate Low-Level\nRadioactive Waste Management Commission (Commis­\nsion), composed of two voting members from each party\nState. Art. 4(A), id., at 1874.\n   A pre-existing facility in Barnwell, South Carolina was\nto serve as the initial facility for regional generators to\ndispose of their low-level radioactive waste. Art. 2(10), id.,\nat 1873. That facility was scheduled to close as the re­\ngional-disposal facility for the Compact by the end of 1992,\nibid., and so the Compact required the Commission to\ndevelop “procedures and criteria for identifying . . . a host\n[S]tate for the development of a second regional disposal\nfacility,” and to “seek to ensure that such facility is li­\ncensed and ready to operate as soon as required but in no\nevent later than 1991,” Art. 4(E)(6), id., at 1875. The\nCompact authorized the Commission to “designate” a\nparty State as a host State for the facility. Art. 4(E)(7),\nibid.\n   In September 1986, the Commission designated North\nCarolina as the host for the second facility. North Caro­\nlina therefore became obligated to “take appropriate steps\nto ensure that an application for a license to construct and\noperate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is\nfiled with and issued by the appropriate authority.” Art.\n5(C), id., at 1877. In 1987, North Carolina’s General\nAssembly created the North Carolina Low-Level Radioac­\ntive Waste Management Authority (Authority) to fulfill\nthe State’s obligation. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G (1987), 1987\nN. C. Sess. Laws ch. 850.\n   Although “[t]he Commission is not responsible for any\ncosts associated with,” among other things, “the creation of\nany facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876, North Carolina\nasked the Commission for financial assistance with build­\ning and licensing costs. The Commission responded by\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadopting a resolution, which declared it was both “appro­\npriate and necessary” for the Commission “to provide\nfinancial assistance” to North Carolina. App. 63. To that\nend, the Commission created a “Host States Assistance\nFund” to help North Carolina with the “financial costs and\nburdens” of “preliminary planning, the administrative\npreparation, and other pre-operational” activities. Id., at\n64.\n   The estimate in 1989 was that it would cost approxi­\nmately $21 million and take two years to obtain a license\nfor North Carolina’s regional-disposal facility.      That\nproved to be wildly optimistic. By 1990, the cost estimate\nhad ballooned to $45.8 million, and the estimated date for\nobtaining a license now extended far into 1993. At the\nbeginning of 1994 there still was no license, and the esti­\nmated cost had grown to $87.1 million. By end of 1994 the\nestimate was $112.5 million, and issuance of a license was\nnot anticipated until 1997. And by December 1996 the\nestimated cost had increased by another $27 million and\nthe projected date to receive a license had become August\n2000.\n   North Carolina’s own appropriations—approximately\n$27 million from Fiscal Year 1988 through Fiscal Year\n(FY) 1995—did not cover the costs of the licensing phase.\nBut during the same time period, the Commission pro­\nvided North Carolina with approximately $67 million.\nThe funds came from surcharges and access fees collected\nfor that purpose from generators disposing of low-level\nradioactive waste at the pre-existing Barnwell facility.\nId., at 71–74, 145.\n   In July 1995, however, South Carolina withdrew from\nthe Compact, thereby depriving the Commission of contin­\nued revenues from the Barnwell facility. In 1996, the\nCommission accordingly informed North Carolina that it\nwould no longer be able to provide financial support for\nlicensing activities. The Governor of North Carolina\n4              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresponded that the State was not prepared to assume a\ngreater portion of the project’s costs, and would not be able\nto proceed without continued Commission funding.\nShortly thereafter the Commission adopted a resolution\ndeclaring that it was willing and able to provide additional\nfunds, but calling on North Carolina to work with it to\ndevelop long-term funding sources for the facility. From\nFY 1996 through FY 1998, the Commission provided\nNorth Carolina approximately an additional $12.27 mil­\nlion in financial assistance. North Carolina, for its part,\ncontinued to provide its own funds toward licensing activi­\nties—another $6 million during the same time period.\n   In August 1997, the Commission notified North Caro­\nlina that absent a plan for funding the remaining steps of\nthe licensing phase, it would not disburse additional funds\nto North Carolina after November 30, 1997. North Caro­\nlina responded that it would not be able to continue with­\nout additional guarantees of external funding. On Decem­\nber 1, 1997, the parties having failed to agree upon a long­\nterm financing plan, the Commission ceased financial\nassistance to North Carolina. By then it had provided\nalmost $80 million.\n   On December 19, 1997, North Carolina informed the\nCommission it would commence an orderly shutdown of its\nlicensing project, and since that date has taken no further\nsteps toward obtaining a license for the facility. But it did\ncontinue to fund the Authority for several more years, in\nthe hope that the project would resume upon the restora­\ntion of external financial assistance. North Carolina\nmaintained the proposed facility site, preserved the work\nit had completed to date, and retained the Authority’s\nbooks and records. It also participated in discussions with\nthe Commission, generators of low-level radioactive waste,\nand other stakeholders regarding options to resolve the\nfinancing shortfall. From FY 1988 through FY 2000,\nNorth Carolina had expended almost $34 million toward\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nobtaining a license.\n   In June 1999, after attempts to resolve the funding\nimpasse had failed, Florida and Tennessee filed with the\nCommission a complaint for sanctions against North\nCarolina. It alleged that North Carolina had failed to\nfulfill its obligations under the Compact, and requested\n(among other things) return of the almost $80 million paid\nto North Carolina by the Commission, plus interest, as\nwell as damages and attorney’s fees. The next month,\nNorth Carolina withdrew from the Compact by enacting a\nlaw repealing its status as a party State, see 1999 N. C.\nSess. Laws ch. 357, as required by Article 7(G) of the\nCompact.\n   More than four months later, in December 1999, the\nCommission held a sanctions hearing. North Carolina did\nnot participate. After the hearing, the Commission con­\ncluded that North Carolina had failed to fulfill its obliga­\ntions under the Compact. It adopted a resolution demand­\ning that North Carolina repay approximately $80 million,\nplus interest, to the Commission; pay an additional $10\nmillion penalty to compensate the Commission for the loss\nof future revenue (surcharges and access fees) it would\nhave received had a facility been completed in North\nCarolina; and pay the Commission’s attorney’s fees. North\nCarolina did not comply.\n   In July 2000, seeking to enforce its sanctions resolution,\nthe Commission moved for leave to file a bill of complaint\nunder our original jurisdiction. Southeast Interstate Low-\nLevel Radioactive Waste Management Commission v.\nNorth Carolina, No. 131, Orig. North Carolina opposed\nthe motion on the grounds that the Commission could not\ninvoke this Court’s original jurisdiction, and we invited\nthe Solicitor General to express the views of the United\nStates. 531 U. S. 942 (2000). The Solicitor General filed a\nbrief urging denial of the Commission’s motion on the\ngrounds that the Commission’s bill of complaint did not\n6              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfall within our exclusive original jurisdiction over “contro­\nversies between two or more States.” §1251(a). We denied\nthe Commission’s motion. 533 U. S. 926 (2001).\n   In June 2002, the States of Alabama, Florida, Tennes­\nsee, and Virginia, joined by the Commission (collectively\nPlaintiffs), moved for leave to file a bill of complaint\nagainst North Carolina. North Carolina opposed the\nmotion, and we again sought the views of the Solicitor\nGeneral. 537 U. S. 806 (2002). The United States urged\nthat we grant Plaintiffs’ motion, which we did. 539 U. S.\n925 (2003). The bill of complaint contains five counts:\nviolation of the party States’ rights under the Compact\n(Count I); breach of contract (Count II); unjust enrichment\n(Count III), promissory estoppel (Count IV); and money\nhad and received (Count V). Plaintiffs’ prayer for relief\nrequests a declaration that North Carolina is subject to\nsanctions and that the Commission’s sanctions resolution\nis valid and enforceable, as well as the award of damages,\ncosts, and other relief.\n   We assigned the case to a Special Master, 540 U. S.\n1014 (2003), who has conducted proceedings and now has\nfiled two reports. The Master’s Preliminary Report ad­\ndressed three motions filed by the parties. He recom­\nmended denying without prejudice North Carolina’s mo­\ntion to dismiss the Commission’s claims against North\nCarolina on the grounds of sovereign immunity. Prelimi­\nnary Report 4–14. He recommended denying Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on Count I, which sought\nenforcement of the Commission’s sanctions resolution. Id.,\nat 14–33. He recommended granting North Carolina’s\ncross-motion to dismiss Count I and other portions of the\nbill of complaint that sought enforcement of the sanctions\nresolution. Id., at 33–34. And he recommended denying\nNorth Carolina’s motion to dismiss the claims in Counts\nII–V. Id., at 34–43.\n   After the Special Master issued his Preliminary Report,\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The Special\nMaster’s Second Report recommended denying Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment on Count II, Second Report\n8–35, and granting North Carolina’s motion for summary\njudgment on Count II, id., at 35–40. Finally, he recom­\nmended denying North Carolina’s motion for summary\njudgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims in Counts III–V.\nId., at 41–45.\n                            II\n  Plaintiffs present a total of seven exceptions to the\nSpecial Master’s two reports. We address them in turn.\n                                A\n   Their first exception challenges the Special Master’s\nconclusion that the Commission lacked authority to im­\npose monetary sanctions upon North Carolina. The terms\nof the Compact determine that question.\n   Article 4(E) of the Compact sets forth the Commission’s\n“duties and powers.” Among its powers are the authority\n“[t]o revoke the membership of a party [S]tate that will­\nfully creates barriers to the siting of a needed regional\nfacility,” Art. 4(E)(7), 99 Stat. 1875, and the authority “[t]o\nrevoke the membership of a party [S]tate in accordance\nwith Article 7(f),” Art. 4(E)(11), ibid. Conspicuously ab­\nsent from Article 4, however, is any mention of the author­\nity to impose monetary sanctions. Plaintiffs contend that\nauthority may be found elsewhere—in the first paragraph\nof Article 7(F), which provides in relevant part:\n      “Any party [S]tate which fails to comply with the\n    provisions of this compact or to fulfill the obligations\n    incurred by becoming a party [S]tate to this compact\n    may be subject to sanctions by the Commission, in­\n    cluding suspension of its rights under this compact\n    and revocation of its status as a party [S]tate.” Id., at\n8              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    1879.\nThe sanctions expressly identified in Article 7(F)—\n“suspension” of rights and “revocation” of party-state\nstatus—flow directly from the Commission’s power in\nArticles 4(E)(7) and (11) to revoke a party State’s member­\nship. That can fairly be understood to include the lesser\npower to suspend a party State’s rights. There is no simi­\nlar grounding in Article 4(E) of authority to impose mone­\ntary sanctions, and the absence is significant.\n   According to Plaintiffs, however, the word “sanctions” in\nArticle 7(F) naturally “includ[es]” monetary sanctions.\nSince the Compact contains no definition of “sanctions,”\nwe give the word its ordinary meaning. A “sanction” (in\nthe sense the word is used here) is “[t]he detriment loss of\nreward, or other coercive intervention, annexed to a viola­\ntion of a law as a means of enforcing the law.” Webster’s\nNew International Dictionary 2211 (2d ed. 1957) (herein­\nafter Webster’s Second); see Black’s Law Dictionary 1458\n(9th ed. 2009) (“A penalty or coercive measure that results\nfrom failure to comply with a law, rule, or order”). A\nmonetary penalty is assuredly one kind of “sanction.” See\ngenerally Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607,\n621 (1992). But there are many others, ranging from the\nwithholding of benefits, or the imposition of a nonmone­\ntary obligation, to capital punishment. The Compact\nsurely does not authorize the Commission to impose all of\nthem.\n   Ultimately, context dictates precisely which “sanctions”\nare authorized under Article 7(F), and nothing in the\nCompact suggests that these include monetary measures.\nThe only two “sanctions” specifically identified as being\nincluded within Article 7(F) are “suspension” of a State’s\nrights under the Compact and “revocation” of its status as\na party State. These are arguably merely examples, and\nmay not exhaust the universe of sanctions the Commission\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncan impose. But they do establish “illustrative applica­\ntion[s] of the general principle,” Federal Land Bank of St.\nPaul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941),\nwhich underlies the kinds of sanctions the Commission\ncan impose. It is significant that both these specifically\nauthorized sanctions are prospective and nonmonetary in\nnature.\n   Moreover, Article 3 of the Compact provides: “The rights\ngranted to the party [S]tates by this compact are addi­\ntional to the rights enjoyed by sovereign states, and noth­\ning in this compact shall be construed to infringe upon,\nlimit, or abridge those rights.” 99 Stat. 1873. Construing\nArticle 7(F) to authorize monetary sanctions would violate\nthis provision, since the primeval sovereign right is im­\nmunity from levies against the government fisc. See, e.g.,\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 750–751 (1999).\n   Finally, a comparison of the Compact’s terms with those\nof “[o]ther interstate compacts, approved by Congress\ncontemporaneously,” Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S. 554,\n565 (1983), confirms that Article 7(F) does not authorize\nmonetary sanctions. At the same time Congress consented\nto this Compact, it consented to three other interstate\ncompacts that expressly authorize their commissions to\nimpose monetary sanctions against the parties to the\ncompacts. See Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioac­\ntive Waste Management Compact, Art. IV(i)(14), 99 Stat.\n1915 (hereinafter Northeast Compact); Central Midwest\nInterstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art.\nVIII(f), 99 Stat. 1891 (hereinafter Central Midwest Com­\npact); Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste\nCompact, Art. VII(e), 99 Stat. 1870 (hereinafter Central\nCompact). The Compact “clearly lacks the features of\nthese other compacts, and we are not free to rewrite it” to\nempower the Commission to impose monetary sanctions.\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 565.\n10              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                            B\n\n  Because the Compact does not authorize the Commis­\nsion to impose monetary sanctions, Plaintiffs’ second\nexception—that North Carolina could not avoid monetary\nsanctions by withdrawing from the Compact—is moot.\nThe third exception also pertains to the Commission’s\nsanctions resolution: that North Carolina forfeited its\nright to object to a monetary penalty by failing to partici­\npate at the sanctions hearing. Plaintiffs have failed to\nargue this exception. They have merely noted that North\nCarolina refused to participate at the sanctions hearing,\nand have cited no law in support of the proposition that\nthis was a forfeit. We deem the exception abandoned. It\nwas wisely abandoned, because it is meritless. North\nCarolina opposed the sanctions resolution and denied that\nthe Commission had jurisdiction to impose sanctions\nagainst it.\n                               C\n  Plaintiffs next take exception to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation that no binding effect or even deference\nbe accorded to the Commission’s conclusion that North\nCarolina violated Article 5(C) of the Compact. We are\nbound by the Commission’s conclusion of breach only if\nthere is “an explicit provision or other clear indicatio[n]” in\nthe Compact making the Commission the “sole arbiter of\ndisputes” regarding a party State’s compliance with the\nCompact. Id., at 569–570. Plaintiffs assert there is such a\nprovision, the second sentence of Article 7(C), which\nstates: “The Commission is the judge of the qualifications\nof the party [S]tates and of its members and of their com­\npliance with the conditions and requirements of this com­\npact and the laws of the party [S]tates relating to the\nenactment of this compact.” 99 Stat. 1879.\n  Plaintiffs greatly overread this provision. The limited\nnature of the authority to “judge” that it confers upon the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission is clear from its context. The first sentence of\nArticle 7(C) states that an eligible State “shall be de­\nclared” a party State “upon enactment of this compact into\nlaw by the [S]tate and upon [the] payment of” a $25,000\nfee, as “required by Article 4(H)(1).” Ibid. The second\nsentence makes the Commission the “judge” of four mat­\nters, all of which concern status as a party State or Com\nmission member. First, the Commission is the judge of the\n“qualifications” of a State to become a party State (the\nqualifications set forth in Article 7(A) for the initial party\nStates and in Article 7(B) for States that subsequently\npetition to join). Second, the Commission is the judge of\nthe qualifications of the members of the Commission,\nwhich are specified in Article 4(A). Third, the Commission\nis the judge of a party State’s compliance with the “condi­\ntions” and “requirements” of the Compact. The former\nterm is an obvious reference to Article 7(B): “The Commis­\nsion may establish such conditions as it deems necessary\nand appropriate to be met by a [S]tate wishing . . . to\nbecome a party [S]tate to this [C]ompact.” Id., at 1878.\nThe accompanying term “requirements” also refers to\nArticle 7’s prescriptions for prospective party States, such\nas paying the “fees required” under Article 7(C), id., at\n1879, and obtaining, as Article 7(B) requires, a two-thirds\nvote of the Commission in favor of admission. Finally, the\nCommission is the judge of the “laws of the party [S]tates\nrelating to the enactment of this compact.” Art. 7(C), ibid.\nAgain, that concerns status as a party State, which re­\nquires that the State “enac[t] . . . this compact into law,”\nibid. The Commission is the “judge” of only these specific\nmatters.\n   This is not to say the Commission lacks authority to\ninterpret the Compact or to say whether a party State has\nviolated its terms. That is of course implicit in its power\nto sanction under Article 7(F). But because “the express\nterms of the [Southeast] Compact do not constitute the\n12             ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCommission as the sole arbiter” regarding North Caro­\nlina’s compliance with its obligations under the Compact,\nTexas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S., at 569, we are not bound\nto follow the Commission’s findings.\n   Plaintiffs argue that we nonetheless owe deference to\nthe Commission’s conclusion. But unless the text of an\ninterstate compact directs otherwise, we do not review the\nactions of a compact commission “on the deferential model\nof judicial review of administrative action by a federal\nagency.” Id., at 566–567. The terms of this Compact do\nnot establish that “this suit may be maintained only as\none for judicial review of the Commission’s” determination\nof breach. Id., at 567. Accordingly, we do not apply ad­\nministrative-law standards of review, but exercise our\nindependent judgment as to both fact and law in executing\nour role as the “exclusive” arbiter of controversies between\nthe States, §1251(a).\n                              D\n  Plaintiffs’ next two exceptions are to the Special Mas­\nter’s recommendations to deny their motion for summary\njudgment on their breach-of-contract claims, and to grant\nNorth Carolina’s motion for summary judgment on those\nclaims. In resolving motions for summary judgment in\ncases within our original jurisdiction, we are not techni­\ncally bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but\nwe use Rule 56 as a guide. This Court’s Rule 17.2; Ne\nbraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584, 590 (1993). Hence,\nsummary judgment is appropriate where there “is no\ngenuine issue as to any material fact” and the moving\nparty is “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S.\n317, 322 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S.\n242, 248 (1986).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010) \n         13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               1\n\n   Plaintiffs claim North Carolina breached the Compact in\nDecember 1997, when (as it admits) it ceased all efforts\ntoward obtaining a license. At that point, in their view,\nNorth Carolina was no longer “tak[ing] appropriate steps\nto ensure that an application for a license to construct and\noperate a [low-level radioactive waste storage facility] is\nfiled with and issued by the appropriate authority,” Art.\n5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. North Carolina says that once the\nCommission ceased providing financial assistance on\nDecember 1, and once it became clear there was insuffi­\ncient funding to complete the licensing phase, there were\nno more “appropriate” steps to take. The Special Master\nconcluded that the phrase “appropriate steps” in Article\n5(C) was ambiguous, and that the parties’ course of per­\nformance established that North Carolina was not re­\nquired to take steps toward obtaining a license once it was\nmade to bear the remaining financial burden of the licens­\ning phase. Second Report 10–24, 35–36. Plaintiffs take\nexception to that conclusion.\n   Article 5(C) does not require North Carolina to take any\nand all steps to license a regional-disposal facility; only\nthose that are “appropriate.” Plaintiffs contend that this\nrequires North Carolina to take the steps set forth in the\nregulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission govern­\ning the filing and disposition of applications for licenses to\noperate radioactive waste disposal facilities, 10 CFR pt. 61\n(1997). Those regulations set forth some, but certainly not\nall, of the “steps” the State would have to take to obtain a\nlicense. But Article 5(C) does not incorporate the regula­\ntions by reference, much less describe them as the appro\npriate steps.\n   We could accept Plaintiffs’ contention if “appropriate”\nmeant “necessary” (the steps set forth in the regulation\nare assuredly necessary to obtaining a license). But it\ndoes not. Whether a particular step is “appropriate”—\n14             ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“[s]pecially suitable; fit; proper,” Webster’s Second 133—\ncould depend upon many factors other than its mere in­\ndispensability to obtaining a license. It would not be\nappropriate, for example, to take a step whose cost greatly\nexceeded whatever benefits the license would confer, or if\nit was highly uncertain the license would ever issue.\n   In determining whether, in terminating its efforts to\nobtain a license, North Carolina failed to take what the\nparties considered “appropriate” steps, the parties’ course\nof performance under the Compact is highly significant.\nSee, e.g., New Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 830–831\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §§202(4), 203 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement).\nThat firmly establishes that North Carolina was not ex­\npected to go it alone—to proceed with the very expensive\nlicensing process without any external financial assis­\ntance. The history of the Compact consists entirely of\nshared financial burdens. From the beginning, North\nCarolina made clear that it required financial assistance\nto do the extensive work required for obtaining a license.\nThe Commission promptly declared it was “appropriate\nand necessary” to assist North Carolina with the costs.\nApp. 63. It provided the vast majority of funding for li­\ncensing-related activities—$80 million, compared to North\nCarolina’s $34 million. The Commission repeatedly noted\nthe necessity (and propriety) of providing financial assis­\ntance to North Carolina, and reiterated its dedication to\nsharing the substantial financial burdens of the licensing\nphase. See, e.g., id., at 63, 71, 145. There is nothing to\nsupport the proposition that the other States had an obli­\ngation under the Compact to share the licensing costs\nthrough the Commission; but we doubt that they did so\nout of love for the Tarheel State. They did it, we think,\nbecause that was their understanding of how the Compact\nwas supposed to work. One must take the Commission at\nits word, that it was “appropriate” to share the cost—\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich suggests that it would not have been appropriate to\nmake North Carolina proceed on its own.\n   Nor was North Carolina required after December 19,\n1997, to continue to expend its own funds at the same\nlevel it had previously (which Plaintiffs concede had satis­\nfied North Carolina’s obligation to take “appropriate\nsteps”). Once the Commission refused to provide any\nfurther financial assistance, North Carolina would have\nhad to assume an unlimited financial commitment to cover\nall remaining licensing costs. Even if it maintained its\nprior rate of appropriations going forward, it would not\nhave come close to covering the at least $34 million needed\nfor the last steps of the licensing phase. And since the\nincome from the South Carolina facility had been termi­\nnated, there was no apparent prospect of funding for the\nconstruction phase (expected to cost at least $75 million).\nIn connection with its August 1997 refusal to provide\nfurther assistance, the Commission itself had said, “[I]t\nwill be imprudent to continue to deplete Commission\nresources for this purpose if a source of funds is not estab­\nlished soon for the ultimate completion of the project.” Id.,\nat 306, 307; Joint Supp. Fact Brief App. 36, 37. And in\nMarch 1998, the Commission “strongly” reiterated that “it\nwould be imprudent to spend additional funds for licens­\ning activities if funds will not be available to complete the\nproject.” Id., at 59. What was imprudent for the Commis­\nsion would surely have been imprudent (and hence inap­\npropriate) for North Carolina as well. The State would\nhave wasted millions of its taxpayers’ dollars on what\nseemed to be a futile effort.\n   JUSTICE BREYER would uphold Plaintiffs’ challenge on\nthis point. He believes that the Compact obligated North\nCarolina to fund and complete the licensing and construc­\ntion of a nuclear waste facility. Post, at 2, 4–6 (opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). In fact, how­\never, North Carolina was not even contractually required\n16                 ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto “secur[e] a license,” post, at 2, but only to take “appro­\npriate steps” to obtain one, Art. 5(C), 99 Stat. 1877. And\nnothing in the terms of the Compact required North Caro­\nlina either to provide “adequate funding” for or to “beg[i]n\nconstruction” on a regional facility, post, at 2. Other con­\ntemporaneously enacted interstate compacts expressly\nprovide that the host State is “responsible for the timely\ndevelopment” of a regional facility, Central Midwest Com­\npact, Art. VI(f), 99 Stat. 1887; Midwest Compact,\nArt. VI(e), id., at 1898, or “shall . . . [c]ause a regional\nfacility to be developed on a timely basis,” Rocky Mountain\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, Art. III(d)(i), id.,\nat 1903–1904. But the compact here before us has no such\nprovision, and the contrast is telling.1 Texas v. New Mex\nico, 462 U. S., at 565. Moreover, the Commission’s state­\nments described in the preceding paragraph, that it would\nbe imprudent to commit additional resources “ ‘if a source\nof funds is not established soon for the ultimate comple­\ntion of the project,’ ” or “ ‘if funds will not be available to\ncomplete the project,’ ” surely suggest that North Carolina\nis not committed to the funding by contract.\n   JUSTICE BREYER asserts, post, at 4–5, that the rotating­\n\n——————\n   1 The Compact provides only that the host State is “responsible for\n\nthe availability . . . of their regional facilities in accordance with”\nArticle 5(B). Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873–1874. The latter section makes\nclear that responsibility for “availability” does not mean that the host\nState will fund construction of the facility, but that it will keep it open\nand not impose unreasonable restrictions on its use. JUSTICE BREYER is\ncorrect that the Compact says the Commission is not “responsible” for\nthe costs of “the creation” of a regional facility. Art. 4(K)(1), id., at\n1876. But what is important here is that it does not say that the host\nState is responsible—which (if it were true) would almost certainly\nhave been joined with saying who was not responsible. What JUSTICE\nBREYER overlooks is the possibility that no one is responsible, and the\nlicensing and construction of the facility is meant to depend upon\nvoluntary funding by interested parties, such as the party States, the\nCommission, and low-level radioactive waste generators.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhost requirement in the Compact, see Art. 5(A), 99 Stat.\n1873, necessarily implies that North Carolina is solely\nresponsible for the licensing and construction costs of its\nfacility. But all that requirement entails is that a party\nState “shall not be designated” as a host State for a second\ntime before “each [other] party [S]tate” has taken a turn.\nIbid. It can perfectly well envision that the States will\ntake turns in bearing the lead responsibility for getting\nthe facility licensed, supervising its construction, and\noperating the facility on its soil. In fact, that is just what\nits text suggests, since it describes the responsibility that\nis to be rotated as the host State’s “obligation . . . to have a\nregional facility operated within its borders.” Ibid. Not to\nconstruct it, or pay for its construction, but to “have [it]\noperated within its borders.” As noted above, other con­\ntemporaneously enacted compacts do spell out the obliga­\ntion of the host State to construct the facility. Still others\nat least provide that the host State will recoup its costs\nthrough disposal fees—which arguably suggests that the\nhost State is to bear the costs. See, e.g., Central Compact,\nArt. III(d),    99    Stat.  1865;     Northeast       Compact,\nArt. III(c)(2), id., at 1913. The compact before us here\ndoes not even contain that arguable suggestion.\n   What it comes down to, then, is JUSTICE BREYER’s intui­\ntion that the whole point of the Compact was that each\ndesignated host State would bear the up-front costs of\nlicensing and construction, but would eventually recoup\nthose costs through its regional monopoly on the disposal\nof low-level radioactive waste. Post, at 5–6. He can cite no\nprovision in the Compact which reflects such an under­\nstanding, and the behavior of the parties contradicts it.2 It\n——————\n  2 The course-of-dealing evidence that JUSTICE BREYER identifies, post,\n\nat 6–7, is not probative. The Commission’s statements that it is not\nlegally responsible for costs and that at some point Commission funds\nwill no longer be available, and North Carolina’s assurances that it will\nkeep its commitments and honor its obligations, are perfectly compati­\n18                 ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould, moreover, have been a foolish understanding, since\nthe regional monopoly to recoup construction costs would\nnot be a monopoly if South Carolina withdrew and contin­\nued to operate its facility—which is exactly what hap­\npened in 1995.3 Even leaving aside the principle, dis­\ncussed infra, at 21, that implied obligations are not to be\nread into interstate compacts, JUSTICE BREYER’s intuition\nfails to reflect the reality of what was implied.\n                              2\n   Plaintiffs take exception to the Special Master’s rejec­\ntion of their alternative argument that North Carolina\nrepudiated the Compact when it announced it would not\ntake further steps toward obtaining a license. They argue\nthat North Carolina’s announcement that it was shutting\ndown the project constituted a refusal to tender any fur­\nther performance under the contract.\n   Plaintiffs’ repudiation theory fails for the same reasons\ntheir breach theory fails. A repudiation occurs when an\nobligor either informs an obligee “that the obligor will\n——————\nble with the proposition that North Carolina did not have to provide all\nfunding for licensing the facility, and that it would be “inappropriate” to\nproceed toward obtaining a license for a facility that would never be\nneeded or built.\n  3 South Carolina’s withdrawal from the Compact not only “could”\n\naffect North Carolina’s ability to recoup its facility costs, as JUSTICE\nBREYER grudgingly concedes, post, at 5; it unquestionably would. With\na regional competitor in the Barnwell facility and declining demand for\nwaste disposal facilities due to technological and other factors, App.\n261, 263–264, North Carolina would receive significantly lower reve­\nnues from its facility, id., at 261–262, 265. The document attached to a\n1996 letter from North Carolina to the Commission trumpeting “$600\nmillion in cost savings” that would come from a new facility, post, at 5,\nproves precisely the opposite of what JUSTICE BREYER thinks. The cost\nsavings were to accrue “to all generators” of waste, App. 266 (emphasis\nadded)—that is, those who would use North Carolina’s facility. Those\nsavings would come, of course, from lower costs for waste disposal,\nwhich means that North Carolina would be charging lower rates than\nthe Barnwell facility (and thus receiving lower revenues).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Neither event occurred here.\nNorth Carolina never informed the Commission (or any\nparty State) that it would not fulfill its Article 5(C) obliga­\ntion to take appropriate steps toward obtaining a license.\nRather, it refused to take further steps that were not\nappropriate. Nor did North Carolina take an affirmative\nact that rendered it unable to perform. To the contrary, it\ncontinued to fund the Authority for almost two years; it\nmaintained the records of the Authority; and it preserved\nthe work completed to date while waiting for alternative\nfunding sources that would enable resumption of the\nproject. Plaintiffs further argue that a repudiation was\neffected by North Carolina’s refusal to take further steps\ntoward licensing “except on conditions which go beyond”\nthe terms of the Compact, Restatement §250, Comment b\n(internal quotation marks omitted)—i.e., the provision of\nexternal-financial assistance. But, as we have discussed,\nexternal-financial assistance was contemplated by the\nCompact.\n                              E\n   Plaintiffs’ final exception is to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation to deny their motion for summary judg­\nment, and to grant North Carolina’s cross-motion for\nsummary judgment, on their claim that North Carolina\nviolated the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing\nwhen it withdrew from the Compact in July 1999. Plain­\ntiffs concede that North Carolina could withdraw from the\nCompact, but contend it could not do so in “bad faith.”\nAnd, they assert, its withdrawal after accepting $80 mil­\nlion from the Commission, and with monetary sanctions\npending against it, was the epitome of bad faith.\n20                ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   We have never held that an interstate compact approved\nby Congress includes an implied duty of good faith and\nfair dealing. Of course “[e]very contract imposes upon\neach party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its\nperformance and enforcement.” Restatement §205. But\nan interstate compact is not just a contract; it is a federal\nstatute enacted by Congress. If courts were authorized to\nadd a fairness requirement to the implementation of\nfederal statutes, judges would be potent lawmakers in­\ndeed. We do not—we cannot—add provisions to a federal\nstatute. See, e.g., Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503\nU. S. 249, 254 (1992). And in that regard a statute which\nis a valid interstate compact is no different. Texas v. New\nMexico, 462 U. S., at 564, 565. We are especially reluctant\nto read absent terms into an interstate compact given the\nfederalism and separation-of-powers concerns that would\narise were we to rewrite an agreement among sovereign\nStates, to which the political branches consented. As we\nhave said before, we will not “ ‘order relief inconsistent\nwith [the] express terms’ ” of a compact, “no matter what\nthe equities of the circumstances might otherwise invite.”\nNew Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S., at 811 (quoting Texas\nv. New Mexico, supra, at 564).\n   The Compact imposes no limitation on North Carolina’s\nexercise of its statutory right to withdraw. Under Article\n7(G), which governed North Carolina’s withdrawal,4 “any\nparty [S]tate may withdraw from the compact by enacting\na law repealing the compact.” 99 Stat. 1879. There is no\nrestriction upon a party State’s enactment of such a law,\n——————\n  4 After North Carolina was designated as a host State, the Compact\n\nwas amended to add Article 7(H), which restricted the ability of a party\nState to withdraw to within 30 days after a second regional-disposal\nfacility opened.

Covell, 727 F. 2d 1145, 1153 (CADC 1984) (opinion\nfor the court by Scalia, J.). Moreover, Article 3 ensures\nthat no such restrictions may be implied, since it provides\nthat the Compact shall not be “construed to infringe upon,\nlimit or abridge” the sovereign rights of a party State.\n   A comparison of the Compact with other, contemporane­\nously enacted, compacts confirms there is no such limita­\ntion on North Carolina’s right to withdraw. See Texas v.\nNew Mexico, supra, at 565. In contrast to the Compact,\nseveral other compacts concerning the creation of regional\nfacilities for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste\ncontain express good-faith limitations upon a State’s\nexercise of its rights.      See, e.g., Central Compact,\nArt. III(f), 99 Stat. 1865; Central Midwest Compact,\nArt. V(a), id., at 1886; Midwest Interstate Low-Level\nRadioactive Waste Management Compact, Art.

The Special\nMaster recommended denying the motion without preju­\ndice, because the claims in Counts III–V “requir[e] further\nbriefing and argument, and possibly further discovery.”\n22                ALABAMA v.

Perhaps\nthe States can bring them in their capacity as parens\npatriae, but as the Special Master noted “the parties have\nnot adequately briefed this issue, and its resolution in this\ncase is unclear.” Id., at 42–43.\n  We think it was reasonable for the Special Master to\ndefer ruling. We granted the Special Master discretion to\n“direct subsequent proceedings” and “to submit such re­\nports as he may deem appropriate.” 540 U. S., at 1014.\nHe could have deferred filing any report until full factual\ndiscovery had been completed and all of the legal issues,\nmany of which are novel and challenging, had been fully\nbriefed, considered, and decided. Instead, he concluded\nthat our immediate resolution of Counts I and II would\nfacilitate the efficient disposition of the case; and in agree­\ning to hear exceptions to his Preliminary Report and\nSecond Report we implicitly agreed. His deferral of ruling\non the merits of Counts III–V is part and parcel of the\nsame case management, and we find no reason to upset it.\n                            B\n   North Carolina takes exception to the Special Master’s\nrecommendation in his Preliminary Report to deny with­\nout prejudice its motion to dismiss the Commission’s\nclaims on the ground that they are barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment to the Constitution and by structural princi­\nples of state sovereign immunity. The Special Master\nassumed for the sake of argument that a State possesses\nsovereign immunity against a claim brought by an entity,\nlike the Commission, created by an interstate compact,5\n——————\n  5 We have held that an entity created through a valid exercise of the\nInterstate Compact Clause is not entitled to immunity from suit under\nthe Eleventh Amendment, see Hess v.

But he recommended denying\nNorth Carolina’s motion to dismiss “at this point in the\nproceedings.” Ibid.\n  The Special Master relied upon our decision in Arizona\nv. California, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), which held that the\nEleventh Amendment did not bar the participation of\nseveral Indian Tribes in an original action concerning the\nallocation of rights to the waters of the Colorado River.\nThe United States had already intervened, in its capacity\nas trustee for several Indian Tribes; but the Tribes moved\nto intervene as well, and the States opposed. We granted\nthe Tribes’ motion, stating that the States do not enjoy\nsovereign immunity against the United States, and “[t]he\nTribes do not seek to bring new claims or issues against\nthe States, but only ask leave to participate in an adjudi­\ncation of their vital water rights that was commenced by\nthe United States.” Id., at 614. Thus, “our judicial power\nover the controversy is not enlarged by granting leave to\nintervene, and the States’ sovereign immunity protected\nby the Eleventh Amendment is not compromised.” Ibid.\nRelying on this holding, the Special Master held that\nsovereign immunity does not bar the Commission’s suit, so\nlong as the Commission asserts the same claims and seeks\nthe same relief as the other plaintiffs. Whether that is so,\nhe said, “cannot be resolved without further factual and\nlegal development[s],” Preliminary Report 6, and so North\nCarolina is free to renew its motion at a later point, id., at\n13–14. See Second Report 45–48.\n Assuming (as the Special Master did) that the Commis­\nsion’s claims against North Carolina implicate sovereign\nimmunity, we agree with his disposition. North Carolina\ncontends that making application of the Constitution’s\nwaiver of sovereign immunity turn upon whether a\nnonsovereign party seeks to expand the relief sought is\n—————— \n\nan entity’s suit against a State is barred by sovereign immunity. \n\n24                ALABAMA v.

California has been implic­\nitly overruled.6 See Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long\nTerm Care, Inc., 529 U. S. 1, 18 (2000). Neither of them\narose under our original jurisdiction, and neither cited\nArizona v. California or discussed—at all—the sovereign\nimmunity issue that case addressed.

California\ncannot apply to the Commission’s claims, because the\nCommission does not—indeed, cannot—assert the same\nclaims or seek the same relief as the plaintiff States. We\ndisagree.

See\nArizona v. California, supra, at 614. The Commission is\n“a legal entity separate and distinct from” the States that\nare parties to the Compact. Art. 4(M)(1), 99 Stat. 1877.\nSince it is not a party it has neither a contractual right to\nperformance by the party States nor enforceable statutory\nrights under Article 5 of the Compact, see Bennett v.\nSpear, 520 U. S. 154, 162–163 (1997). The Compact does,\nhowever, authorize the Commission to “act or appear on\nbehalf of any party [S]tate or [S]tates . . . as an intervenor\nor party in interest before . . . any court of law,” Art.\n4(E)(10), 99 Stat. 1875, and it is obviously in this capacity\nthat the Commission seeks to vindicate the plaintiff\nStates’ statutory and contractual rights in Counts I and II.\nIts Count I and Count II claims therefore rise or fall with\nthe claims of the States. While the Commission may not\nbring them in a stand-alone action under this Court’s\noriginal jurisdiction, see §1251(a), it may assert them in\n26             ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis Court alongside the plaintiff States, see Arizona v.\nCalifornia, 460 U. S., at 614. The summary judgment\ndisallowing the underlying claims on their merits renders\nthe sovereign immunity question with regard to any relief\nthe Commission alone might have on those claims moot.\n  Counts III–V, which do not rely upon the Compact,\nstand on a different footing. As to them, while the Com­\nmission again seemingly makes the same claims and seeks\nthe same relief as the States, it is conceivable that as a\nmatter of law the Commission’s claims are not identical.\nThe Commission can claim restitution as the party that\npaid the money to North Carolina; the other plaintiffs\ncannot claim it on that basis. Whether this means that\nthe claims are not identical for Arizona v.

Rather, plaintiffs’ argu\nment is that the Compact’s terms, properly construed,\nspeak not only to the specific duties imposed upon the\nparties but also to the manner in which those duties must\nbe carried out. This is an interpretive argument familiar\nto contract disputes. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of\nContracts §205 (1979) (hereinafter Restatement).\n   As the opinion for the Court notes, congressional con\nsent to an interstate compact gives it the status of a fed\neral statute. See ante, at 20. This is an apt and proper\nway to indicate that a compact has all the dignity of an\nAct of Congress. And that is surely what was meant in\nNew Jersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 811 (1998), where\nit was stated that the Court may not “ ‘order relief incon\nsistent with [the] express terms’ ” of a compact. Ante, at\n20 (quoting New Jersey; alteration in original; some inter\n2              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nnal quotation marks omitted); see also Cuyler v. Adams,\n449 U. S. 433, 438 (1981) (“[C]ongressional consent trans\nforms an interstate compact . . . into a law of the United\nStates”).\n  From this principle, however, it simply does not follow\nthat a law’s nature and origin as a compact must be dis\nmissed as irrelevant. Like a treaty, a compact represents\nan agreement between parties. See New Jersey, supra, at\n831 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Compact here is of\ncourse a treaty”). The Court’s duty in interpreting a com\npact involves ascertaining the intent of the parties. See\nSullivan v. Kidd, 254 U. S. 433, 439 (1921) (“[T]reaties are\nto be interpreted upon the principles which govern the\ninterpretation of contracts . . . with a view to making\neffective the purposes of the high contracting parties”);\nWright v. Henkel, 190 U. S. 40, 57 (1903) (“Treaties must\nreceive a fair interpretation, according to the intention of\nthe contracting parties”). Carrying out this duty may lead\nthe Court to consult sources that might differ from those\nnormally reviewed when an ordinary federal statute is at\nissue. That much is surely implicit in the Court’s refer\nence to contract law principles elsewhere in its opinion in\nthe instant case. See, e.g., ante, at 14 (“[T]he parties’\ncourse of performance under the Compact is highly signifi\ncant”); ibid. (citing the Restatement); id., at 18–19 (same);\nsee also New Jersey, supra, at 830–831 (SCALIA, J., dis\nsenting) (construing a compact in light of “hornbook con\ntracts law that the practical construction of an ambiguous\nagreement revealed by later conduct of the parties is good\nindication of its meaning”).\n  That said, it is quite correct to hold here that the rea\nsonable expectations of the contracting States, as mani\nfested in the Compact, do not reveal an intent to limit\nNorth Carolina’s power of withdrawal. For purposes of\nrejecting this argument, it is sufficient to note—as the\nCourt does—that the Compact permits any State to with\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

See ante,\nat 20–21. Federalism concerns also counsel reluctance to\nfind that a State has implicitly restricted its sovereignty in\nsuch a manner.\n   The Court is therefore correct to reject plaintiffs’ final\nexception.

One of these things is not like the others: The Com\nmission is not a sovereign State. The Court entertains its\nsuit—despite North Carolina’s sovereign immunity—\nbecause the Commission “asserts the same claims and\nseeks the same relief as the other plaintiffs.” Ante, at 23.\nOur Constitution does not countenance such “no harm, no\nfoul” jurisdiction, and I respectfully dissent.\n   The Court has made this mistake before. In Arizona v.\nCalifornia, 460 U. S. 605 (1983), we allowed Indian Tribes\nthat could not sue sovereign States to piggyback on the\nclaims of the United States, which could. We reasoned\nthat once the United States had initiated suit, the state\ndefendants could “no longer . . . assert [their] immunity\nwith respect to the subject matter of [the] action,” so the\nTribes were free to pile on and join the suit. Id., at 614.\nToday the Court retraces Arizona’s steps, quoting that\ncase for the proposition that when private plaintiffs “ ‘do\n2              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nnot seek to bring new claims or issues, . . . our judicial\npower over the controversy is not enlarged . . . , and the\nStates’ sovereign immunity protected by the Eleventh\nAmendment is not compromised.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting\nArizona, supra, at 614).\n  That statement is contrary to the language of the Con\nstitution. The Eleventh Amendment provides:\n      “The Judicial power of the United States shall not\n    be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,\n    commenced or prosecuted against one of the United\n    States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or\n    Subjects of any Foreign State.”\nThe immunity conferred is against the “commence[ment]\nor prosecut[ion]” of “any suit in law or equity.” There is no\ncarve-out for suits “prosecuted” by private parties so long\nas those parties “ ‘do not seek to bring new claims or is\nsues.’ ” Ante, at 23 (quoting Arizona, supra, at 614).\n   Understandably, the Court’s opinion leans heavily on\nArizona, which has never been squarely overruled. Ante,\nat 23–24. But Arizona itself is built on sand. The relevant\nportion of that opinion is almost wholly unreasoned. It\ncites only a footnote in a prior case, the pertinent para\ngraph of which failed even to discuss the State’s immunity\nfrom private suit. See 460 U. S., at 614 (citing Maryland\nv. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 745, n. 21 (1981)). That para\ngraph addressed only intervention, not sovereign immu\nnity, and the two issues are distinct. See South Carolina\nv. North Carolina, 558 U. S. ___, ___, n. 5 (2010) (slip op.,\nat 10, n. 5).\n   Most importantly, the subsequent development of our\nsovereign immunity jurisprudence has only undermined\nArizona’s already weak foundations. We recognized in\nAlden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 718 (1999), that the Consti\ntution left intact the States’ pre-existing “immunity from\nprivate suits”; as the Eleventh Amendment confirms, the\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nStates did not “ ‘surrender . . . this immunity in the plan of\nthe convention.’ ” Id., at 717 (quoting The Federalist No.\n81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)); see also\nAlden, supra, at 718–722, 755–756. There is no reason to\nsuppose that the States, at the founding, made an excep\ntion for private suits that happen to mimic other plaintiffs’\nclaims—and neither Arizona nor the Court today suggests\notherwise.\n   Whether or not a plaintiff “seeks the same relief” or\nimposes any “additional defense or liability,” ante, at 23–\n24, simply does not matter in light of our recognition that\nsovereign immunity provides an “immunity from suit,” not\na “defense to . . . liability.” Federal Maritime Comm’n v.\nSouth Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743, 766 (2002).\nAs we have explained, “the relief sought by a plaintiff\nsuing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit\nis barred.” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44,\n58 (1996). Indeed, we have suggested that private parties\nmay not sue even if a court is “precluded . . . from award\ning them any relief.” Federal Maritime Comm’n, supra, at\n766 (emphasis added) (dictum). It is the fact that a pri\nvate party is allowed to sue a sovereign State—not the\nburden of litigation or the relief sought—that infringes the\nimmunity of the State. “The Eleventh Amendment is\nconcerned not only with the States’ ability to withstand\nsuit, but with their privilege not to be sued.” Puerto Rico\nAqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.,\n506 U. S. 139, 147, n. 5 (1993).\n   It is therefore impossible for the Court to hear private\nclaims against a nonconsenting State without expanding\n“our judicial power over the controversy.” Arizona, supra,\nat 614. Sovereign immunity is a limitation on that power.\nThe similarity of claims may be relevant to joinder or\nintervention, but those are procedural means of processing\nclaims, not fonts of judicial authority. See Henderson v.\nUnited States, 517 U. S. 654, 664 (1996).\n4                 ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n   Nor may the Court entertain private claims without\n“compromis[ing]” “the States’ sovereign immunity.” Ari\nzona, 460 U. S., at 614. As a party, the Commission enjoys\nlegally enforceable rights against the defendant State: It\nmay object to settlement, seek taxation of costs, advance\narguments we are obliged to consider, and plead the\njudgment as res judicata in future litigation. If the Com\nmission truly sought nothing for itself—other than “a full\nexposition of the issues,” Preliminary Report of the Special\nMaster 14—it could have participated as an amicus.\n   The Commission and North Carolina know that more is\nat stake if the Commission is allowed to sue the State. It\nis precisely the Commission’s status as a party, its attempt\nto “prosecut[e]” a “suit in law or equity . . . against one of\nthe United States,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 11, that sovereign\nimmunity forbids.\n   I would sustain North Carolina’s first exception to the\nSpecial Master’s reports.*\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  * I also join JUSTICE BREYER’s opinion and all of the Court’s opinion\nsave Parts II–D and III–B.

It states:\n    “Each party state designated as a host state for a re­\n    gional facility shall take appropriate steps to ensure\n    that an application for a license to construct and op­\n    erate a facility . . . is filed with and issued by the ap­\n    propriate authority.” Omnibus Low-Level Radioactive\n    Waste Interstate Compact Consent Act (Consent Act),\n    99 Stat. 1877.\nIn September 1986, North Carolina was “designated as a\nhost state for a regional” low-level nuclear waste disposal\n“facility.” Ibid.; see also App. 417, 432. Soon thereafter,\nNorth Carolina’s General Assembly enacted legislation\n2               ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nauthorizing a state agency to “site, finance, [and] build” a\nwaste disposal facility. N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G–4 (1987)\n(repealed 2000). Pursuant to this legislation, a new facil­\nity was to be completed by January 1, 1993. Ibid.\n   From August 1987 until December 1997, North Carolina\ntook a series of steps to prepare for the construction of the\nstorage facility. See Brief for North Carolina in Support of\nExceptions to Reports of the Special Master 6–8. And\nwhile doing so it continually assured its Compact partners\nthat it “remain[ed] committed to fulfilling its obligations to\nthe Compact to serve as the next host state.” App. 92\n(Letter from James G. Martin, Governor of North Caro­\nlina, to Carroll R. Campbell, Jr., Governor of South Caro­\nlina (October 25, 1990)); Statement of Undisputed Mate­\nrial Facts ¶¶24–26, 28, 33, 37, 39 (detailing press releases,\ngubernatorial letters, and other statements made by\nNorth Carolina expressing its commitment to its Compact\nobligations).\n   But North Carolina never secured a license, never ob­\ntained adequate funding, and never began construction on\na new facility. See Second Report of Special Master 2–3\n(hereinafter Second Report). Eventually, the State simply\nstopped trying: On December 19, 1997, North Carolina\ninformed its fellow member States that it would “com­\nmence the orderly shutdown” of the waste disposal “pro­\nject.” App. 319. After this point, North Carolina admit­\ntedly took no further steps toward obtaining a license or\nbuilding a facility before withdrawing from the Compact in\nJuly 1999.

More to\nthe point, if a builder promises that he will “take appro­\npriate steps to ensure” that a customer will be able to\nmove into a new home in two years, and then does nothing\nat all, has the builder not broken his promise?\n   As the majority notes, “[o]ther contemporaneously en­\nacted interstate compacts” delineated a host State’s obli­\ngations in more detail than the Southeast Compact does.\nAnte, at 16–17. But this fact may just as easily be read to\nindicate what the parties here intended, rather than, as\nthe majority argues, what they did not intend. Regard­\nless, the language of the Compact and the context in which\nit was enacted—as part of a congressional effort to en­\ncourage regional solutions to this Nation’s low-level radio­\nactive waste problem, see Consent Act, 99 Stat. 1859; Low-\nLevel Radioactive Waste Policy Act, §4(a)(1), 94 Stat.\n3348—both indicate that North Carolina was supposed to\ntake “appropriate steps” to build a low-level radioactive\nwaste disposal facility. And North Carolina’s General\nAssembly passed a state statute recognizing and accepting\nthis responsibility. See N. C. Gen. Stat. §104G–4 (creating\na state agency to “site, finance, [and] build” a waste dis­\nposal facility). How can it be that two years of inactivity\nfollowed by withdrawal satisfies this promise?\n   The answer, says the Court, is that any further “appro­\npriate steps” would have cost a significant amount of\nmoney. Ante, at 14–15. In 1997, the Southeast Interstate\nLow-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission\n(Commission), the entity responsible for administering the\nCompact, made clear that it would not advance North\nCarolina any more money toward building a facility. See\n4               ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                      Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nApp. 315. In response, North Carolina concluded that it\nwas unwilling to fund the rest of the project itself. See id.,\nat 317–319. And the Court agrees that it would have been\n“imprudent” for North Carolina to spend further funds, in\nlight of the Commission’s refusal to do so also. Ante, at\n15–16.\n   But this is an odd excuse. If a builder promises to “take\nappropriate steps” to build me a house, the fact that he\nruns out of funds would not normally excuse his breaking\nhis promise—at least if it is he, and not I, who is responsi­\nble for financing the project. See 2 E. Farnsworth, Con­\ntracts §9.6, p. 638 (3d ed. 2004) (Farnsworth) (courts\n“generally” conclude that “additional expense” “does not\nrise to the level of impracticability” so as to excuse a party\nfrom performance). And here it is North Carolina, and not\nanyone else, who bears ultimate responsibility for finding\nthe funds.\n   The text, structure, and purpose of the Compact all\ndemonstrate this fact. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2,\nthe Compact expressly provides that the Commission “is\nnot responsible for any costs associated with . . . the crea­\ntion of any facility,” Art. 4(K)(1), 99 Stat. 1876. Rather,\nthe Compact States determined that each “party state”\nshould take a turn as the “host state,” during which time\nthat State would be obligated to build a facility and then\noperate it for 20 years. See Art. 3(A), id., at 1873; Art.\n5(A), id., at 1877; Art. 5(C), ibid.; Art. 5(E), 103 Stat. 1289;\nsee also Art. 3(C), 99 Stat. 1873–1874 (“Host states are\nresponsible for the availability, the subsequent post­\nclosure observation and maintenance, and the extended\ninstitutional control of their regional facilities”). The host\nState would then recover its upfront construction expenses\nfrom the considerable fees and surcharges charged to the\nwaste generators served by the facility. N. C. Gen. Stat.\n§§104G–15(a)–(b) (repealed 2000) (“It is the intent of the\nGeneral Assembly that the cost of all activities [toward\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But, as far as I am aware, North Carolina did not\nseriously seek to amend the Compact when South Caro­\nlina departed (even though the State had sought and\nobtained an amendment previously, see ante, at 20, n. 4;\nBrief for North Carolina in Reply to Exceptions By Plain­\ntiffs to Reports of the Special Master 27), nor has it argued\nto this Court that South Carolina’s departure voided its\ncontractual obligations. Indeed, there is evidence in the\nrecord indicating that, even after South Carolina left the\nCompact, North Carolina continued to believe that the\noperation of a waste disposal facility presented a substan­\ntial financial opportunity. App. 255, 266 (Attachment to\nLetter from John H. MacMillan, Executive Director, North\nCarolina Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management\nAuthority, to Richard S. Hodes, M. D., Chairman, South­\neast Compact Commission (Dec. 13, 1996) (enclosing a\nbusiness plan identifying $600 million in cost savings that\ncould provide a “substantial return” on the “investment\nneeded to put the North Carolina facility into operation”)).\n   I thus cannot conclude, as the majority does, that the\nCompact’s rotational design, as I understand it, is “fool­\nish.” Ante, at 18. Rather, the Compact’s structure repre­\nsents what, in my view, was a understandable decision by\nthe contracting States, all of whom needed a waste dis­\nposal facility, to bind themselves together so that each\nwould take a turn “bear[ing] the cost of building” the\nnecessary facility. Preliminary Report of Special Master\n21 (citing Art. 4(K), 99 Stat. 1876–1877); see Brief for\n6              ALABAMA v. NORTH CAROLINA\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nRocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact\nBoard et al. as Amici Curiae 16–18. This rotational ap­\nproach is surely a sensible solution to the problems caused\nby the widespread existence of low-level nuclear waste and\nthe political unpopularity of building the necessary facili­\nties to house it. See id., at 13–16; New York v. United\nStates, 505 U. S. 144, 149–151 (1992).\n   The only contrary evidence—i.e., that indicates that\nNorth Carolina did not bear ultimate funding responsibil­\nity—consists of the fact that the Commission voluntarily\nadvanced North Carolina nearly $80 million between 1988\nand 1998 in order to help it defray its costs. Second Re­\nport 16. The Court believes that this “course of perform­\nance” demonstrates that, once the Commission turned off\nits monetary spigot, North Carolina was no longer re­\nquired to do anything further. Ante, at 14–15. But why?\nIf I advance my builder half the cost of a building, I have\nnot thereby promised to advance him the whole cost. This\nis particularly true when the contract says I am responsi­\nble for none of the cost of the building. At the very least,\nsomething more in the circumstances would have to show\nthat additional expenditure had become a reasonable\nexpectation.\n   In this case, nothing suggests that North Carolina could\nreasonably expect further financing assistance. Indeed, I\ncan find nothing in the majority’s opinion, or the record,\nthat suggests that the Commission or the other Compact\nStates intended to let North Carolina off the hook. And\nnumerous documents indicate precisely the opposite—that\ndespite the Commission’s funding assistance, North Caro­\nlina was still responsible for funding the project.

And North Carolina\nadmittedly took no steps towards building a disposal facil­\nity from December 1997 and July 1999: It did no in-depth\nstudy of the further financing that might be necessary; it\nmade no serious effort to look for alternative funding; the\nExecutive of the State did not ask its legislature for any\nappropriation.
