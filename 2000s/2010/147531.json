Argued March 3, 2010\u2014Decided June 1, 2010\nRespondents, who were persecuted by the Somali government during\n  the 1980\u2019s, filed a damages action alleging that petitioner, who then\n  held high level government positions, exercised command and control\n  over the military forces committing the abuses; that he knew or\n  should have known of these acts; and that he aided and abetted in\n  their commission. The District Court concluded that it lacked sub\n  ject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the\n  suit, resting its decision on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of\n  1976 (FSIA or Act), which provides that a \u201cforeign state shall be im\n  mune from the jurisdiction\u201d of both federal and state courts except as\n  provided in the Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71604. The Fourth Circuit reversed,\n  holding that the FSIA does not apply to officials of a foreign state.\nHeld: The FSIA does not govern petitioner\u2019s claim of immunity. Pp. 4\u2013\n 20.\n    (a) Under the common-law doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity,\n see Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, if the State De\n partment granted a sovereign\u2019s diplomatic request for a \u201csuggestion\n of immunity,\u201d the district court surrendered its jurisdiction, Ex parte\n Peru, 318 U. S. 573, 581, 587. If the State Department refused, the\n court could decide the immunity issue itself. Id., at 587. In 1952, the\n State Department moved from a policy of requesting immunity in\n most actions against friendly sovereigns to a \u201crestrictive\u201d theory that\n confined immunity \u201cto suits involving the foreign sovereign\u2019s public\n acts.\u201d Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 487.\n Inconsistent application of sovereign immunity followed, leading to\n the FSIA, whose primary purposes are (1) to endorse and codify the\n restrictive theory, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for decid\n ing \u201cclaims of foreign states to immunity\u201d from the State Department\n2                         SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    to the courts. \u00a71602. This Act now governs the determination\n    whether a foreign state is entitled to sovereign immunity. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest that\n    \u201cforeign state\u201d should be read to include an official acting on behalf of\n    that state. The Act specifies that a foreign state \u201cincludes a political\n    subdivision . . . or an agency or instrumentality\u201d of that state,\n    \u00a71603(a), and specifically delimits what counts as an \u201cagency or in\n    strumentality,\u201d \u00a71603(b). Textual clues in the \u201cagency or instrumen\n    tality\u201d definition\u2014\u201cany entity\u201d matching three specified characteris\n    tics, ibid.\u2014cut against reading it to include a foreign official.\n    \u201cEntity\u201d typically refers to an organization; and the required statu\n    tory characteristics\u2014e.g., \u201cseparate legal person,\u201d \u00a71603(b)(1)\u2014apply\n    awkwardly, if at all, to individuals. Section 1603(a)\u2019s \u201cforeign state\u201d\n    definition is also inapplicable. The list set out there, even if illustra\n    tive rather than exclusive, does not suggest that officials are in\n    cluded, since the listed defendants are all entities. The Court\u2019s con\n    clusion is also supported by the fact that Congress expressly\n    mentioned officials elsewhere in the FSIA when it wished to count\n    their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state. Moreover, other\n    FSIA provisions\u2014e.g., \u00a71608(a)\u2014point away from reading \u201cforeign\n    state\u201d to include foreign officials. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (c) The FSIA\u2019s history and purposes also do not support petitioner\u2019s\n    argument that the Act governs his immunity claim. There is little\n    reason to presume that when Congress codified state immunity, it in\n    tended to codify, sub silentio, official immunity. The canon of con\n    struction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the\n    common law does not help decide the question whether, when a stat\n    ute\u2019s coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended it to govern a par\n    ticular field. State and official immunities may not be coextensive,\n    and historically, the Government has suggested common-law immu\n    nity for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qual\n    ify. Though a foreign state\u2019s immunity may, in some circumstances,\n    extend to an individual for official acts, it does not follow that Con\n    gress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA. Official immu\n    nity was simply not the problem that Congress was addressing when\n    enacting that Act. The Court\u2019s construction of the Act should not be\n    affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt\n    to select between application of the FSIA or the common law. This\n    case, where respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity\n    and seek damages from his own pockets, is governed by the common\n    law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as defined by the\n    FSIA.

BASHE \n\n            ABDI YOUSUF ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  From 1980 to 1986 petitioner Mohamed Ali Samantar\nwas the First Vice President and Minister of Defense of\nSomalia, and from 1987 to 1990 he served as its Prime\nMinister. Respondents are natives of Somalia who allege\nthat they, or members of their families, were the victims of\ntorture and extrajudicial killings during those years. They\nseek damages from petitioner based on his alleged au\nthorization of those acts. The narrow question we must\ndecide is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of\n1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71330, 1602 et seq., pro\nvides petitioner with immunity from suit based on actions\ntaken in his official capacity. We hold that the FSIA does\nnot govern the determination of petitioner\u2019s immunity\nfrom suit.\n                             I\n  Respondents are members of the Isaaq clan, which\nincluded well-educated and prosperous Somalis who were\nsubjected to systematic persecution during the 1980\u2019s by\nthe military regime then governing Somalia. They allege\nthat petitioner exercised command and control over mem\n2                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbers of the Somali military forces who tortured, killed, or\narbitrarily detained them or members of their families;\nthat petitioner knew or should have known of the abuses\nperpetrated by his subordinates; and that he aided and\nabetted the commission of these abuses.1 Respondents\u2019\ncomplaint sought damages from petitioner pursuant to the\nTorture Victim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note\nfollowing 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, and the Alien Tort Statute, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71350. Petitioner, who was in charge of Somalia\u2019s\narmed forces before its military regime collapsed, fled\nSomalia in 1991 and is now a resident of Virginia. The\nUnited States has not recognized any entity as the gov\nernment of Somalia since the fall of the military regime.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4.\n   Respondents filed their complaint in November 2004,\nand petitioner promptly moved to dismiss. The District\nCourt stayed the proceedings to give the State Depart\nment an opportunity to provide a statement of interest\nregarding petitioner\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity. Each\nmonth during the ensuing two years, petitioner advised\nthe court that the State Department had the matter \u201c \u2018still\nunder consideration.\u2019 \u201d No. 1:04cv1360 (ED Va., Aug. 1,\n2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. In 2007, having received\nno response from the State Department, the District Court\nreinstated the case on its active docket. The court con\ncluded that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction and\ngranted petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n   The District Court\u2019s decision rested squarely on the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although we do not set out respondents\u2019 allegations in detail, the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s written opinion contains a comprehensive summary,\ndescribing not only the abuses respondents suffered but also the his\ntorical context in which the abuses occurred, as well as some of the\nattempts to establish a stable government in Somalia in recent years.\nSee No. 1:04cv1360 (ED Va., Aug. 1, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a\u2013\n43a.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFSIA.2 The FSIA provides that a \u201cforeign state shall be\nimmune from the jurisdiction\u201d of both federal and state\ncourts except as provided in the Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71604,\nand the District Court noted that none of the parties had\nargued that any exception was applicable, App. to Pet. for\nCert. 46a\u201347a. Although characterizing the statute as\nsilent on its applicability to the officials of a foreign state,\nthe District Court followed appellate decisions holding\nthat a foreign state\u2019s sovereign immunity under the Act\nextends to \u201c \u2018an individual acting in his official capacity on\nbehalf of a foreign state,\u2019 \u201d but not to \u201c \u2018an official who acts\nbeyond the scope of his authority.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 47a (quoting\nVelasco v. Government of Indonesia, 370 F. 3d 392, 398,\n399 (CA4 2004)). The court rejected respondents\u2019 argu\nment that petitioner was necessarily acting beyond the\nscope of his authority because he allegedly violated inter\nnational law.3\n   The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District\nCourt\u2019s ruling that the FSIA governs petitioner\u2019s immu\nnity from suit. It acknowledged \u201cthe majority view\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Petitioner argued that, in addition to his immunity under the FSIA,\nthe complaint should be dismissed on a number of other grounds, which\nthe District Court did not reach. See id., at 45a, n. 11.\n  3 Because we hold that the FSIA does not govern whether an individ\n\nual foreign official enjoys immunity from suit, we need not reach\nrespondents\u2019 argument that an official is not immune under the FSIA\nfor acts of torture and extrajudicial killing. See Brief for Respondents\n51\u201353. We note that in determining petitioner had not acted beyond\nthe scope of his authority, the District Court afforded great weight to\nletters from the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to the\nState Department, App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a, in which the TFG sup\nported petitioner\u2019s claim of immunity and stated \u201cthe actions attributed\nto [petitioner] in the lawsuit . . . would have been taken by [petitioner]\nin his official capacities,\u201d App. 104. Although the District Court de\nscribed the TFG as \u201crecognized by the United States as the governing\nbody in Somalia,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a, the United States does not\nrecognize the TFG (or any other entity) as the government of Somalia,\nsee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5.\n4                       SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\namong the Circuits that \u201cthe FSIA applies to individual\nofficials of a foreign state.\u201d 552 F. 3d 371, 378 (CA4\n2009).4 It disagreed with that view, however, and con\ncluded, \u201cbased on the language and structure of the stat\nute, that the FSIA does not apply to individual foreign\ngovernment agents like [petitioner].\u201d Id., at 381.5 Having\nfound that the FSIA does not govern whether petitioner\nenjoys immunity from suit, the Court of Appeals re\nmanded the case for further proceedings, including a\ndetermination of whether petitioner is entitled to immu\nnity under the common law. Id., at 383\u2013384. We granted\ncertiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n   The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity developed as\na matter of common law long before the FSIA was enacted\nin 1976. In Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,\n461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983), we explained that in Schooner\nExchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812), \u201cChief Jus\ntice Marshall concluded that . . . the United States had\nimpliedly waived jurisdiction over certain activities of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Compare 552 F. 3d, at 381 (holding the FSIA does not govern the\n\nimmunity of individual foreign officials), and Enahoro v. Abubakar, 408\nF. 3d 877, 881\u2013882 (CA7 2005) (same), with Chuidian v. Philippine\nNat. Bank, 912 F. 2d 1095, 1103 (CA9 1990) (concluding that a suit\nagainst an individual official for acts committed in his official capacity\nmust be analyzed under the FSIA), In re Terrorist Attacks on September\n11, 2001, 538 F. 3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008) (same), Keller v. Central Bank of\nNigeria, 277 F. 3d 811, 815 (CA6 2002) (same), Byrd v. Corporacion\nForestal y Industrial de Olancho S. A., 182 F. 3d 380, 388 (CA5 1999)\n(same), and El-Fadl v. Central Bank of Jordan, 75 F. 3d 668, 671\n(CADC 1996) (same).\n  5 As an alternative basis for its decision, the Court of Appeals held\n\nthat even if a current official is covered by the FSIA, a former official is\nnot. See 552 F. 3d, at 381\u2013383. Because we agree with the Court of\nAppeals on its broader ground that individual officials are not covered\nby the FSIA, petitioner\u2019s status as a former official is irrelevant to our\nanalysis.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nforeign sovereigns.\u201d The Court\u2019s specific holding in Schoo\nner Exchange was that a federal court lacked jurisdiction\nover \u201ca national armed vessel . . . of the emperor of\nFrance,\u201d id., at 146, but the opinion was interpreted as\nextending virtually absolute immunity to foreign sover\neigns as \u201ca matter of grace and comity,\u201d Verlinden, 461\nU. S., at 486.\n   Following Schooner Exchange, a two-step procedure\ndeveloped for resolving a foreign state\u2019s claim of sovereign\nimmunity, typically asserted on behalf of seized vessels.\nSee, e.g., Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 34\u2013\n36 (1945); Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 587\u2013589 (1943);\nCompania Espanola de Navegacion Maritima, S. A. v. The\nNavemar, 303 U. S. 68, 74\u201375 (1938). Under that proce\ndure, the diplomatic representative of the sovereign could\nrequest a \u201csuggestion of immunity\u201d from the State De\npartment. Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 581. If the request\nwas granted, the district court surrendered its jurisdic\ntion. Id., at 588; see also Hoffman, 324 U. S., at 34. But\n\u201cin the absence of recognition of the immunity by the\nDepartment of State,\u201d a district court \u201chad authority to\ndecide for itself whether all the requisites for such immu\nnity existed.\u201d Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 587; see also\nCompania Espanola, 303 U. S., at 75 (approving judicial\ninquiry into sovereign immunity when the \u201cDepartment of\nState . . . declined to act\u201d); Heaney v. Government of Spain,\n445 F. 2d 501, 503, and n. 2 (CA2 1971) (evaluating sov\nereign immunity when the State Department had not\nresponded to a request for its views). In making that\ndecision, a district court inquired \u201cwhether the ground of\nimmunity is one which it is the established policy of the\n[State Department] to recognize.\u201d Hoffman, 324 U. S., at\n36. Although cases involving individual foreign officials as\ndefendants were rare, the same two-step procedure was\ntypically followed when a foreign official asserted immu\nnity. See, e.g., Heaney, 445 F. 2d, at 504\u2013505; Waltier v.\n6                      SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThomson, 189 F. Supp. 319 (SDNY 1960).6\n   Prior to 1952, the State Department followed a general\npractice of requesting immunity in all actions against\nfriendly sovereigns, but in that year the Department\nannounced its adoption of the \u201crestrictive\u201d theory of sover\neign immunity. Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486\u2013487; see also\nLetter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Depart\nment of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B.\nPerlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull.\n984\u2013985 (1952). Under this theory, \u201cimmunity is confined\nto suits involving the foreign sovereign\u2019s public acts, and\ndoes not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state\u2019s\nstrictly commercial acts.\u201d Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487.\nThis change threw \u201cimmunity determinations into some\ndisarray,\u201d because \u201cpolitical considerations sometimes led\nthe Department to file \u2018suggestions of immunity in cases\nwhere immunity would not have been available under the\nrestrictive theory.\u2019 \u201d Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541\nU. S. 677, 690 (2004) (quoting Verlinden, 461 U. S., at\n487).\n   Congress responded to the inconsistent application of\nsovereign immunity by enacting the FSIA in 1976.\nAltmann, 541 U. S., at 690\u2013691; see also Verlinden, 461\nU.

We begin with\nthe statute\u2019s text and then consider petitioner\u2019s reliance on\nits history and purpose.\n                              III\n   The FSIA provides that \u201ca foreign state shall be immune\nfrom the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and\nof the States\u201d except as provided in the Act. \u00a71604. Thus,\nif a defendant is a \u201cforeign state\u201d within the meaning of\nthe Act, then the defendant is immune from jurisdiction\nunless one of the exceptions in the Act applies. See\n\u00a7\u00a71605\u20131607 (enumerating exceptions). The Act, if it\napplies, is the \u201csole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a\nforeign state in federal court.\u201d Argentine Republic v.\nAmerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 439 (1989).\nThe question we face in this case is whether an individual\nsued for conduct undertaken in his official capacity is a\n\u201cforeign state\u201d within the meaning of the Act.\n   The Act defines \u201cforeign state\u201d in \u00a71603 as follows:\n        \u201c(a) A \u2018foreign state\u2019 . . . includes a political subdivi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npose,\u201d reads as follows:\n   \u201cThe Congress finds that the determination by United States courts\nof the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such\ncourts would serve the interests of justice and would protect the rights\nof both foreign states and litigants in United States courts. Under\ninternational law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of\nforeign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and\ntheir commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of\njudgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial\nactivities. Claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be\ndecided by courts of the United States and of the States in conformity\nwith the principles set forth in this chapter.\u201d\n8                  SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    sion of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality\n    of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).\n       \u201c(b) An \u2018agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\u2019\n    means any entity\u2014\n       \u201c(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or\n    otherwise, and\n       \u201c(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political\n    subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or\n    other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or\n    political subdivision thereof, and\n       \u201c(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the\n    United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of\n    this title, nor created under the laws of any third\n    country.\u201d\n   The term \u201cforeign state\u201d on its face indicates a body\npolitic that governs a particular territory. See, e.g., Re\nstatement \u00a74 (defining \u201cstate\u201d as \u201can entity that has a\ndefined territory and population under the control of a\ngovernment and that engages in foreign relations\u201d). In\n\u00a71603(a), however, the Act establishes that \u201cforeign state\u201d\nhas a broader meaning, by mandating the inclusion of the\nstate\u2019s political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentali\nties. Then, in \u00a71603(b), the Act specifically delimits what\ncounts as an agency or instrumentality. Petitioner argues\nthat either \u201cforeign state,\u201d \u00a71603(a), or \u201cagency or instru\nmentality,\u201d \u00a71603(b), could be read to include a foreign\nofficial. Although we agree that petitioner\u2019s interpretation\nis literally possible, our analysis of the entire statutory\ntext persuades us that petitioner\u2019s reading is not the\nmeaning that Congress enacted.\n   We turn first to the term \u201cagency or instrumentality of a\nforeign state,\u201d \u00a71603(b). It is true that an individual\nofficial could be an \u201cagency or instrumentality,\u201d if that\nterm is given the meaning of \u201cany thing or person through\nwhich action is accomplished,\u201d In re Terrorist Attacks on\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nSept. 11, 2001, 538 F. 3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008). But Congress\nhas specifically defined \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d in the\nFSIA, and all of the textual clues in that definition cut\nagainst such a broad construction.\n   First, the statute specifies that \u201c \u2018agency or instrumen\ntality . . .\u2019 means any entity\u201d matching three specified\ncharacteristics, \u00a71603(b) (emphasis added), and \u201centity\u201d\ntypically refers to an organization, rather than an individ\nual. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed. 2009).\nFurthermore, several of the required characteristics apply\nawkwardly, if at all, to individuals. The phrase \u201cseparate\nlegal person, corporate or otherwise,\u201d \u00a71603(b)(1), could\nconceivably refer to a natural person, solely by virtue of\nthe word \u201cperson.\u201d But the phrase \u201cseparate legal person\u201d\ntypically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to\nhold personhood separate from the natural persons who\nare its shareholders or officers. Cf. First Nat. City Bank v.\nBanco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611,\n625 (1983) (\u201cSeparate legal personality has been described\nas \u2018an almost indispensable aspect of the public corpora\ntion\u2019 \u201d). It is similarly awkward to refer to a person as an\n\u201corgan\u201d of the foreign state. See \u00a71603(b)(2). And the\nthird part of the definition could not be applied at all to a\nnatural person. A natural person cannot be a citizen of a\nState \u201cas defined in section 1332(c) and (e),\u201d \u00a71603(b)(3),\nbecause those subsections refer to the citizenship of corpo\nrations and estates. Nor can a natural person be \u201ccreated\nunder the laws of any third country.\u201d Ibid.8 Thus, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Petitioner  points out that \u00a71603(b)(3) describes only which defen\ndants cannot be agencies or instrumentalities. He suggests that it\ntherefore tells us nothing about which defendants can be covered by\nthat term. Brief for Petitioner 46. Even if so, reading \u00a71603(b) as\npetitioner suggests would leave us with the odd result that a corpora\ntion that is the citizen of a state is excluded from the definition under\n\u00a71603(b)(3), and thus not immune, whereas a natural person who is the\ncitizen of a state is not excluded, and thus retains his immunity.\n10                      SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nterms Congress chose simply do not evidence the intent to\ninclude individual officials within the meaning of \u201cagency\nor instrumentality.\u201d9 Cf. Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538\nU. S. 468, 474 (2003) (describing \u00a71603(b) as containing\n\u201cindicia that Congress had corporate formalities in mind\u201d).\n   Petitioner proposes a second textual route to including\nan official within the meaning of \u201cforeign state.\u201d He ar\ngues that the definition of \u201cforeign state\u201d in \u00a71603(a) sets\nout a nonexhaustive list that \u201cincludes\u201d political subdivi\nsions and agencies or instrumentalities but is not so lim\nited. See Brief for Petitioner 22\u201323. It is true that use of\nthe word \u201cinclude\u201d can signal that the list that follows is\nmeant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.10 And, to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Nor does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress\n\nintended the term \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d to include individuals.\nOn the contrary, the legislative history, like the statute, speaks in\nterms of entities. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131487, p. 15 (1976) (here\ninafter H. R. Rep.) (\u201cThe first criterion, that the entity be a separate\nlegal person, is intended to include a corporation, association, founda\ntion, or any other entity which, under the law of the foreign state where\nit was created, can sue or be sued in its own name\u201d).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA may well be correct that it is not strictly necessary to\nconfirm our reading of the statutory text by consulting the legislative\nhistory, see post, at 1\u20132 (opinion concurring in judgment). But as the\nCourt explained some years ago in an opinion authored by Justice\nWhite:\n   \u201cAs for the propriety of using legislative history at all, common sense\nsuggests that inquiry benefits from reviewing additional information\nrather than ignoring it. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, \u2018[w]here the\nmind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every\nthing from which aid can be derived.\u2019 United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch\n358, 386 (1805). Legislative history materials are not generally so\nmisleading that jurists should never employ them in a good-faith effort\nto discern legislative intent. Our precedents demonstrate that the\nCourt\u2019s practice of utilizing legislative history reaches well into its past.\nSee, e.g., Wallace v. Parker, 6 Pet. 680, 687\u2013690 (1832). We suspect\nthat the practice will likewise reach well into the future.\u201d Wisconsin\nPublic Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 611\u2013612, n. 4 (1991) (altera\ntion in original).\n   10 See 2A N. Singer & J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

But even if the list in \u00a71603(a)\nis merely illustrative, it still suggests that \u201cforeign state\u201d\ndoes not encompass officials, because the types of defen\ndants listed are all entities. See Russell Motor Car Co. v.\nUnited States, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923) (\u201c[A] word may be\nknown by the company it keeps\u201d).\n   Moreover, elsewhere in the FSIA Congress expressly\nmentioned officials when it wished to count their acts as\nequivalent to those of the foreign state, which suggests\nthat officials are not included within the unadorned term\n\u201cforeign state.\u201d Cf. Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.\n85, 103 (2007) (\u201cDrawing meaning from silence is particu\nlarly inappropriate . . . [when] Congress has shown that it\nknows how to [address an issue] in express terms\u201d). For\nexample, Congress provided an exception from the general\ngrant of immunity for cases in which \u201cmoney damages are\nsought against a foreign state\u201d for an injury in the United\nStates \u201ccaused by the tortious act or omission of that\nforeign state or of any official or employee of that foreign\nstate while acting within the scope of his office.\u201d\n\u00a71605(a)(5) (emphasis added). The same reference to\nofficials is made in a similar, later enacted exception. See\n28 U. S. C. A. \u00a71605A(a)(1) (Supp. 2009) (eliminating\nimmunity for suits \u201cin which money damages are sought\nagainst a foreign state\u201d for certain acts \u201cengaged in by an\nofficial, employee, or agent of such foreign state while\nacting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or\nagency\u201d); see also \u00a71605A(c) (creating a cause of action\nagainst the \u201cforeign state\u201d and \u201cany official, employee, or\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u00a747.7, p. 305 (7th ed. 2007) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018includes\u2019 is usually a term of \n\nenlargement, and not of limitation\u201d (some internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)). \n\n12                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nagent\u201d thereof).11 If the term \u201cforeign state\u201d by definition\nincludes an individual acting within the scope of his office,\nthe phrase \u201cor of any official or employee . . .\u201d in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71605(a)(5) would be unnecessary. See Dole Food\nCo., 538 U. S., at 476\u2013477 (\u201c[W]e should not construe the\nstatute in a manner that is strained and, at the same\ntime, would render a statutory term superfluous\u201d).\n  Other provisions of the statute also point away from\nreading \u201cforeign state\u201d to include foreign officials. Con\ngress made no express mention of service of process on\nindividuals in \u00a71608(a), which governs service upon a\nforeign state or political subdivision. Although some of the\nmethods listed could be used to serve individuals\u2014for\nexample, by delivery \u201cin accordance with an applicable\ninternational convention,\u201d \u00a71608(a)(2)\u2014the methods\nspecified are at best very roundabout ways of serving an\nindividual official. Furthermore, Congress made specific\nremedial choices for different types of defendants. See\n\u00a71606 (allowing punitive damages for an agency or in\nstrumentality but not for a foreign state); \u00a71610 (affording\na plaintiff greater rights to attach the property of an\nagency or instrumentality as compared to the property of a\nforeign state). By adopting petitioner\u2019s reading of \u201cforeign\nstate,\u201d we would subject claims against officials to the\nmore limited remedies available in suits against states,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Petitioner argues that \u00a71605A abrogates immunity for certain acts\n\nby individual officials, which would be superfluous if the officials were\nnot otherwise immune. See Brief for Petitioner 41\u201343. But the import\nof \u00a71605A is precisely the opposite. First, \u00a71605A(a)(1) eliminates the\nimmunity of the state for certain acts of its officers; it says a \u201cforeign\nstate shall not be immune\u201d in a suit \u201cin which money damages are\nsought against a foreign state.\u201d As it does not expressly refer to the\nimmunity of individual officers, it adds nothing to petitioner\u2019s argu\nment. Second, the creation of a cause of action against both the \u201cfor\neign state\u201d and \u201cany official, employee, or agent\u201d thereof, \u00a71605A(c),\nreinforces the idea that \u201cforeign state\u201d does not by definition include\nforeign officials.\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwithout so much as a whisper from Congress on the sub\nject. (And if we were instead to adopt petitioner\u2019s other\ntextual argument, we would subject those claims to the\ndifferent, more expansive, remedial scheme for agencies).\nThe Act\u2019s careful calibration of remedies among the listed\ntypes of defendants suggests that Congress did not mean\nto cover other types of defendants never mentioned in the\ntext.\n  In sum, \u201c[w]e do not . . . construe statutory phrases in\nisolation; we read statutes as a whole.\u201d United States v.\nMorton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984). Reading the FSIA as a\nwhole, there is nothing to suggest we should read \u201cforeign\nstate\u201d in \u00a71603(a) to include an official acting on behalf of\nthe foreign state, and much to indicate that this meaning\nwas not what Congress enacted.12 The text does not ex\npressly foreclose petitioner\u2019s reading, but it supports the\nview of respondents and the United States that the Act\ndoes not address an official\u2019s claim to immunity.\n                             IV\n  Petitioner argues that the FSIA is best read to cover his\nclaim to immunity because of its history and purpose. As\ndiscussed at the outset, one of the primary purposes of the\nFSIA was to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign\nimmunity, which Congress recognized as consistent with\nextant international law. See \u00a71602. We have observed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Nor is it the case that the FSIA\u2019s \u201clegislative history does not even\nhint of an intent to exclude individual officials,\u201d Chuidian, 912 F. 2d, at\n1101. The legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend\nthe FSIA to address position-based individual immunities such as\ndiplomatic and consular immunity. H. R. Rep., at 12 (\u201cThe bill is not\nintended . . . . to affect either diplomatic or consular immunity\u201d). It also\nsuggests that general \u201cofficial immunity\u201d is something separate from\nthe subject of the bill. See id., at 23 (\u201cThe bill does not attempt to deal\nwith questions of discovery. . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a\ndiplomat in the United States or a high-ranking official of a foreign\ngovernment, diplomatic and official immunity would apply\u201d).\n14                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat a related purpose was \u201ccodification of international\nlaw at the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment,\u201d Permanent\nMission of India to United Nations v. City of New York,\n551 U. S. 193, 199 (2007), and have examined the relevant\ncommon law and international practice when interpreting\nthe Act, id., at 200\u2013201. Because of this relationship\nbetween the Act and the common law that it codified,\npetitioner argues that we should construe the FSIA con\nsistently with the common law regarding individual im\nmunity, which\u2014in petitioner\u2019s view\u2014was coextensive with\nthe law of state immunity and always immunized a for\neign official for acts taken on behalf of the foreign state.\nEven reading the Act in light of Congress\u2019 purpose of\ncodifying state sovereign immunity, however, we do not\nthink that the Act codified the common law with respect to\nthe immunity of individual officials.\n  The canon of construction that statutes should be inter\npreted consistently with the common law helps us inter\npret a statute that clearly covers a field formerly governed\nby the common law.13 But the canon does not help us to\ndecide the antecedent question whether, when a statute\u2019s\ncoverage is ambiguous, Congress intended the statute to\ngovern a particular field\u2014in this case, whether Congress\nintended the FSIA to supersede the common law of official\nimmunity.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Congress \u201cis understood to legislate against a background of com\n\nmon-law . . . principles,\u201d Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino,\n501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991), and when a statute covers an issue previ\nously governed by the common law, we interpret the statute with the\npresumption that Congress intended to retain the substance of the\ncommon law. See Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 783 (1952)\n(\u201cStatutes which invade the common law . . . are to be read with a\npresumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar\nprinciples, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident\u201d).\n  14 We find similarly inapposite petitioner\u2019s invocation of the canon\n\nthat a statute should be interpreted in compliance with international\nlaw, see Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804),\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Petitioner argues that because state and official immu\nnities are coextensive, Congress must have codified official\nimmunity when it codified state immunity. See Brief for\nPetitioner 26\u201330. But the relationship between a state\u2019s\nimmunity and an official\u2019s immunity is more complicated\nthan petitioner suggests, although we need not and do not\nresolve the dispute among the parties as to the precise\nscope of an official\u2019s immunity at common law. The very\nauthority to which petitioner points us, and which we have\npreviously found instructive, see, e.g., Permanent Mission,\n551 U. S., at 200, states that the immunity of individual\nofficials is subject to a caveat not applicable to any of the\nother entities or persons15 to which the foreign state\u2019s\nimmunity extends. The Restatement provides that the\n\u201cimmunity of a foreign state . . . extends to . . . any other\npublic minister, official, or agent of the state with respect\nto acts performed in his official capacity if the effect of\nexercising jurisdiction would be to enforce a rule of law\nagainst the state.\u201d Restatement \u00a766 (emphasis added).16\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nand his argument that foreign relations and the reciprocal protection of\nUnited States officials abroad would be undermined if we do not adopt\nhis reading of the Act. Because we are not deciding that the FSIA bars\npetitioner\u2019s immunity but rather that the Act does not address the\nquestion, we need not determine whether declining to afford immunity\nto petitioner would be consistent with international law.\n   15 The Restatement does not apply this caveat to the head of state,\n\nhead of government, or foreign minister. See Restatement \u00a766.\nWhether petitioner may be entitled to head of state immunity, or any\nother immunity, under the common law is a question we leave open for\nremand. See 552 F. 3d 371, 383 (CA4 2009). We express no view on\nwhether Restatement \u00a766 correctly sets out the scope of the common\nlaw immunity applicable to current or former foreign officials.\n   16 Respondents contend that this caveat refers to \u201cthe compulsive\n\neffect of the judgment on the state,\u201d Brief for Respondents 42, but\npetitioner disputes that meaning, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17\u201318. We\nneed not resolve their dispute, as it is enough for present purposes that\nthe Restatement indicates a foreign official\u2019s immunity may turn upon\na requirement not applicable to any other type of defendant.\n16                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd historically, the Government sometimes suggested\nimmunity under the common law for individual officials\neven when the foreign state did not qualify. See, e.g.,\nGreenspan v. Crosbie, No. 74 Civ. 4734 (GLG), 1976 WL\n841 (SDNY, Nov. 23, 1976). There is therefore little rea\nson to presume that when Congress set out to codify state\nimmunity, it must also have, sub silentio, intended to\ncodify official immunity.\n  Petitioner urges that a suit against an official must\nalways be equivalent to a suit against the state because\nacts taken by a state official on behalf of a state are acts of\nthe state. See Brief for Petitioner 26. We have recog\nnized, in the context of the act of state doctrine, that an\nofficial\u2019s acts can be considered the acts of the foreign\nstate, and that \u201cthe courts of one country will not sit in\njudgment\u201d of those acts when done within the territory of\nthe foreign state. See Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U. S.\n250, 252, 254 (1897). Although the act of state doctrine is\ndistinct from immunity, and instead \u201cprovides foreign\nstates with a substantive defense on the merits,\u201d Altmann,\n541 U. S., at 700, we do not doubt that in some circum\nstances the immunity of the foreign state extends to an\nindividual for acts taken in his official capacity. But it\ndoes not follow from this premise that Congress intended\nto codify that immunity in the FSIA. It hardly furthers\nCongress\u2019 purpose of \u201cclarifying the rules that judges\nshould apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims,\u201d id.,\nat 699, to lump individual officials in with foreign states\nwithout so much as a word spelling out how and when\nindividual officials are covered.17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 The courts of appeals have had to develop, in the complete absence\n\nof any statutory text, rules governing when an official is entitled to\nimmunity under the FSIA. For example, Courts of Appeals have\napplied the rule that foreign sovereign immunity extends to an individ\nual official \u201cfor acts committed in his official capacity\u201d but not to \u201can\nofficial who acts beyond the scope of his authority.\u201d Chuidian, 912\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner would have a stronger case if there were any\nindication that Congress\u2019 intent to enact a comprehensive\nsolution for suits against states extended to suits against\nindividual officials. But to the extent Congress contem\nplated the Act\u2019s effect upon officials at all, the evidence\npoints in the opposite direction. As we have already men\ntioned, the legislative history points toward an intent to\nleave official immunity outside the scope of the Act. See\nn. 12, supra. And although questions of official immunity\ndid arise in the pre-FSIA period, they were few and far\nbetween.18 The immunity of officials simply was not the\nparticular problem to which Congress was responding\nwhen it enacted the FSIA. The FSIA was adopted, rather,\nto address \u201ca modern world where foreign state enter\nprises are every day participants in commercial activities,\u201d\nand to assure litigants that decisions regarding claims\nagainst states and their enterprises \u201care made on purely\nlegal grounds.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 7. We have been given no\nreason to believe that Congress saw as a problem, or\nwanted to eliminate, the State Department\u2019s role in de\nterminations regarding individual official immunity.19\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nF. 2d, at 1103, 1106. That may be correct as a matter of common-law\nprinciples, but it does not derive from any clarification or codification\nby Congress. Furthermore, if Congress intended the FSIA to reach\nindividuals, one would expect the Act to have addressed whether former\nofficials are covered, an issue it settled with respect to instrumentali\nties, see Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 478 (2003)\n(\u201c[I]nstrumentality status [must] be determined at the time suit is\nfiled\u201d).\n   18 A study that attempted to gather all of the State Department deci\n\nsions related to sovereign immunity from the adoption of the restrictive\ntheory in 1952 to the enactment of the FSIA reveals only four decisions\nrelated to official immunity, and two related to head of state immunity,\nout of a total of 110 decisions. Sovereign Immunity Decisions of the\nDept. of State, May 1952 to Jan. 1977 (M. Sandler, D. Vagts, & B.\nRistau eds.), in Digest of U. S. Practice in Int\u2019l Law 1020, 1080 (1977)\n(hereinafter Digest).\n   19 The FSIA was introduced in accordance with the recommendation\n18                      SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, our reading of the FSIA will not \u201cin effect make\nthe statute optional,\u201d as some Courts of Appeals have\nfeared, by allowing litigants through \u201cartful pleading . . .\nto take advantage of the Act\u2019s provisions or, alternatively,\nchoose to proceed under the old common law,\u201d Chuidian v.\nPhilippine Nat. Bank, 912 F. 2d 1095, 1102 (CA9 1990).\nEven if a suit is not governed by the Act, it may still be\nbarred by foreign sovereign immunity under the common\nlaw. And not every suit can successfully be pleaded\nagainst an individual official alone.20 Even when a plain\ntiff names only a foreign official, it may be the case that\nthe foreign state itself, its political subdivision, or an\nagency or instrumentality is a required party, because\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof the State Department. H. R. Rep., at 6. The Department sought and\nsupported the elimination of its role with respect to claims against\nforeign states and their agencies or instrumentalities. See Hearings on\nH. R. 11315 before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and\nGovernmental Relations of the House of Representatives Committee on\nthe Judiciary, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 34 (1976) (testimony of Monroe\nLeigh, Legal Adviser, Dept. of State) (\u201c[I]t is our judgment . . . that the\nadvantages of having a judicial determination greatly outweigh the\nadvantage of being able to intervene in a lawsuit\u201d). But the Depart\nment has from the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment understood the Act to\nleave intact the Department\u2019s role in official immunity cases. See\nDigest 1020 (\u201cThese decisions [of the Department regarding the immu\nnity of officials] may be of some future significance, because the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act does not deal with the immunity of individ\nual officials, but only that of foreign states and their political subdivi\nsions, agencies and instrumentalities\u201d).\n   20 Furthermore, a plaintiff seeking to sue a foreign official will not be\n\nable to rely on the Act\u2019s service of process and jurisdictional provisions.\nThus, a plaintiff will have to establish that the district court has\npersonal jurisdiction over an official without the benefit of the FSIA\nprovision that makes personal jurisdiction over a foreign state auto\nmatic when an exception to immunity applies and service of process has\nbeen accomplished in accordance with 28 U. S. C. \u00a71608. See \u00a71330(b)\n(\u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim\nfor relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsec\ntion (a),\u201d i.e., claims for which the foreign state is not entitled to immu\nnity, \u201cwhere service has been made under section 1608 of this title\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat party has \u201can interest relating to the subject of the\naction\u201d and \u201cdisposing of the action in the person\u2019s absence\nmay . . . as a practical matter impair or impede the per\nson\u2019s ability to protect the interest.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n19(a)(1)(B). If this is the case, and the entity is immune\nfrom suit under the FSIA, the district court may have to\ndismiss the suit, regardless of whether the official is im\nmune or not under the common law. See Republic of\nPhilippines v. Pimentel, 553 U. S. 851, 867 (2008)\n(\u201c[W]here sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims\nof the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action\nmust be ordered where there is a potential for injury to\nthe interests of the absent sovereign\u201d). Or it may be the\ncase that some actions against an official in his official\ncapacity should be treated as actions against the foreign\nstate itself, as the state is the real party in interest. Cf.\nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 166 (1985) (\u201c[A]n\nofficial-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to\nbe treated as a suit against the entity. It is not a suit\nagainst the official personally, for the real party in inter\nest is the entity\u201d (citation omitted)).\n   We are thus not persuaded that our construction of the\nstatute\u2019s text should be affected by the risk that plaintiffs\nmay use artful pleading to attempt to select between\napplication of the FSIA or the common law. And we think\nthis case, in which respondents have sued petitioner in his\npersonal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets,\nis properly governed by the common law because it is not a\nclaim against a foreign state as the Act defines that term.\nAlthough Congress clearly intended to supersede the\ncommon-law regime for claims against foreign states, we\nfind nothing in the statute\u2019s origin or aims to indicate that\nCongress similarly wanted to codify the law of foreign\nofficial immunity.\n20                 SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              V\n\n   Our review of the text, purpose, and history of the FSIA\nleads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals cor\nrectly held the FSIA does not govern petitioner\u2019s claim of\nimmunity. The Act therefore did not deprive the District\nCourt of subject-matter jurisdiction. We emphasize, how\never, the narrowness of our holding. Whether petitioner\nmay be entitled to immunity under the common law, and\nwhether he may have other valid defenses to the grave\ncharges against him, are matters to be addressed in the\nfirst instance by the District Court on remand. The judg\nment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

BASHE \n\n            ABDI YOUSUF ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.\n   The Court\u2019s admirably careful textual analysis, ante, at\n7\u201313, demonstrates that the term \u201cforeign state\u201d in the\nprovision \u201ca foreign state shall be immune from the juris\ndiction of the courts of the United States and of the\nStates,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71604, does not include foreign offi\ncials. Yet the Court insists on adding legislative history to\nits analysis. I could understand that (though not agree\nwith it) if, in the absence of supposed legislative-history\nsupport, the Court would reach a different result. Or even\nif there was something in the legislative history that\nclearly contradicted the Court\u2019s result, and had to be\nexplained away. That is not the situation here (or at least\nthe Court\u2019s opinion does not think it to be so). The Court\nassures us, however (if this could be thought assurance),\nthat legislative history is \u201c \u2018not generally so misleading\u2019 \u201d\nthat it should \u201c \u2018never\u2019 \u201d be used. Ante, at 10, n. 9 (quoting\nWisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597,\n611\u2013612, n. 4 (1991)). Surely that is damning by faint\npraise. And the Court\u2019s mention of the past practice of\nusing legislative history, ante, at 10, n. 9, does not support\nthe Court\u2019s use of it today. The past practice was \u201cnot the\npractice of using legislative history for the purpose of\ngiving authoritative content to the meaning of a statutory\ntext,\u201d Mortier, supra, at 622 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\n2                   SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\njudgment).\n   The Court\u2019s introduction of legislative history serves no\npurpose except needlessly to inject into the opinion a mode\nof analysis that not all of the Justices consider valid. And\nit does so, to boot, in a fashion that does not isolate the\nsuperfluous legislative history in a section that those of us\nwho disagree categorically with its use, or at least dis\nagree with its superfluous use, can decline to join. I there\nfore do not join the opinion, and concur only in the result.\n   The Court relies on legislative history to support three\nof its positions. First, after explaining why the phrase\n\u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d in the definition of \u201cforeign\nstate,\u201d see \u00a71603(a), (b), does not refer to natural persons,\nante, at 9\u201310, the Court says \u201c[n]or does anything in the\nlegislative history suggest that Congress intended the\nterm \u2018agency or instrumentality\u2019 to include individuals,\u201d\nante, at 10, n. 9. According to the Court, \u201cthe legislative\nhistory, like the statute, speaks in terms of entities.\u201d Ibid.\nApparently, the legislative history must be consulted, not\nto show that it supports the Court\u2019s textual analysis, or\neven to explain why its seeming contradiction of the\nCourt\u2019s analysis is inconsequential, but to show nothing\nmore than that it contains the same ambiguous language\nas the text. This is beyond all reason.\n   Second, after concluding its review of the statute\u2019s text,\nthe Court states that the \u201clegislative history makes clear\nthat Congress did not intend the [Foreign Sovereign Im\nmunities Act of 1976] to address position-based individual\nimmunities such as diplomatic and consular immunity,\u201d\nante, at 13, n. 12. See also ante, at 17. It cites for this\nproposition a House Committee Report that we have no\nreason to believe was read (much less approved) by the\nSenate\u2014or, indeed, by the Members of the House who\nwere not on the Committee\u2014or even, for that matter, by\nthe members of the Committee, who never voted on the\nReport. In any case, the quoted excerpt does not address\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cposition-based individual immunities\u201d in general but only\n\u201cconsular and diplomatic immunity,\u201d which is not at issue\nhere. Unless consular and diplomatic immunity, on the\none hand, and, on the other hand, what is at issue here\u2014\nstate-agent immunity\u2014are always treated the same\n(which I doubt and the Court does not attempt to estab\nlish), the passage contributes nothing to analysis of the\npresent case.\n   The same footnote also quotes a portion of the same\nHouse Report as follows:\n    \u201c \u2018The bill does not attempt to deal with questions of\n    discovery. . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a diplo\n    mat in the United States or a high-ranking official of\n    a foreign government, diplomatic and official immu\n    nity would apply.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 13, n. 12.\nIf anything, this passage cuts against the Court\u2019s result.\nThe two sentences omitted from the above quotation read\nas follows:\n    \u201cExisting law appears to be adequate in this area. For\n    example, if a private plaintiff sought the production of\n    sensitive governmental documents of a foreign state,\n    concepts of governmental privilege would apply.\u201d\n    H. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131487, p. 23 (1976).\nThus, the House Report makes it clear that the bill\u2019s\nfailure to deal with discovery applies to both discovery\nagainst sovereigns and discovery against foreign officials.\nBut the latter would have been unnecessary if the bill\ndealt only with sovereigns. The implication (if any) is that\nthe bill\u2019s provisions regarding immunity from suit apply to\nboth sovereigns and foreign officials.\n  Third, and finally, the Court points to legislative history\nto establish the purpose of the statute. See ante, at 17,\nand n. 19. This is particularly puzzling, because the en\nacted statutory text itself includes findings and a declara\n4                  SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntion of purpose\u2014the very same purpose (surprise!) that\nthe Court finds evidenced in the legislative history. See\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71602. To make matters worse, the Court\nitself notes this statutory declaration of purpose twice\nearlier, in the body of its opinion, see ante, at 6, 13. If\nthose textual references to the statute itself were deleted,\nthe footnoted citation of legislative history would at least\nperform some function. As it is, however, it adds nothing\nexcept the demonstration of assiduous law-clerk research.\n   It should be no cause for wonder that, upon careful\nexamination, all of the opinion\u2019s excerpts from legislative\nhistory turn out to be, at best, nonprobative or entirely\nduplicative of text. After all, legislative history is almost\nnever the real reason for the Court\u2019s decision\u2014and make\nweights do not deserve a lot of the Court\u2019s time.\n",

Argued March 3, 2010\u2014Decided June 1, 2010\nRespondents, who were persecuted by the Somali government during\n  the 1980\u2019s, filed a damages action alleging that petitioner, who then\n  held high level government positions, exercised command and control\n  over the military forces committing the abuses; that he knew or\n  should have known of these acts; and that he aided and abetted in\n  their commission. The District Court concluded that it lacked sub\n  ject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss the\n  suit, resting its decision on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of\n  1976 (FSIA or Act), which provides that a \u201cforeign state shall be im\n  mune from the jurisdiction\u201d of both federal and state courts except as\n  provided in the Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71604. The Fourth Circuit reversed,\n  holding that the FSIA does not apply to officials of a foreign state.\nHeld: The FSIA does not govern petitioner\u2019s claim of immunity. Pp. 4\u2013\n 20.\n    (a) Under the common-law doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity,\n see Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, if the State De\n partment granted a sovereign\u2019s diplomatic request for a \u201csuggestion\n of immunity,\u201d the district court surrendered its jurisdiction, Ex parte\n Peru, 318 U. S. 573, 581, 587. If the State Department refused, the\n court could decide the immunity issue itself. Id., at 587. In 1952, the\n State Department moved from a policy of requesting immunity in\n most actions against friendly sovereigns to a \u201crestrictive\u201d theory that\n confined immunity \u201cto suits involving the foreign sovereign\u2019s public\n acts.\u201d Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 487.\n Inconsistent application of sovereign immunity followed, leading to\n the FSIA, whose primary purposes are (1) to endorse and codify the\n restrictive theory, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for decid\n ing \u201cclaims of foreign states to immunity\u201d from the State Department\n2                         SAMANTAR v.

Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest that\n    \u201cforeign state\u201d should be read to include an official acting on behalf of\n    that state. The Act specifies that a foreign state \u201cincludes a political\n    subdivision . . . or an agency or instrumentality\u201d of that state,\n    \u00a71603(a), and specifically delimits what counts as an \u201cagency or in\n    strumentality,\u201d \u00a71603(b). Textual clues in the \u201cagency or instrumen\n    tality\u201d definition\u2014\u201cany entity\u201d matching three specified characteris\n    tics, ibid.\u2014cut against reading it to include a foreign official.\n    \u201cEntity\u201d typically refers to an organization; and the required statu\n    tory characteristics\u2014e.g., \u201cseparate legal person,\u201d \u00a71603(b)(1)\u2014apply\n    awkwardly, if at all, to individuals. Section 1603(a)\u2019s \u201cforeign state\u201d\n    definition is also inapplicable. The list set out there, even if illustra\n    tive rather than exclusive, does not suggest that officials are in\n    cluded, since the listed defendants are all entities. The Court\u2019s con\n    clusion is also supported by the fact that Congress expressly\n    mentioned officials elsewhere in the FSIA when it wished to count\n    their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state. Moreover, other\n    FSIA provisions\u2014e.g., \u00a71608(a)\u2014point away from reading \u201cforeign\n    state\u201d to include foreign officials. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (c) The FSIA\u2019s history and purposes also do not support petitioner\u2019s\n    argument that the Act governs his immunity claim. There is little\n    reason to presume that when Congress codified state immunity, it in\n    tended to codify, sub silentio, official immunity. The canon of con\n    struction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the\n    common law does not help decide the question whether, when a stat\n    ute\u2019s coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended it to govern a par\n    ticular field. State and official immunities may not be coextensive,\n    and historically, the Government has suggested common-law immu\n    nity for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qual\n    ify. Though a foreign state\u2019s immunity may, in some circumstances,\n    extend to an individual for official acts, it does not follow that Con\n    gress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA. Official immu\n    nity was simply not the problem that Congress was addressing when\n    enacting that Act. The Court\u2019s construction of the Act should not be\n    affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt\n    to select between application of the FSIA or the common law. This\n    case, where respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity\n    and seek damages from his own pockets, is governed by the common\n    law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as defined by the\n    FSIA.

BASHE \n\n            ABDI YOUSUF ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n  JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  From 1980 to 1986 petitioner Mohamed Ali Samantar\nwas the First Vice President and Minister of Defense of\nSomalia, and from 1987 to 1990 he served as its Prime\nMinister. Respondents are natives of Somalia who allege\nthat they, or members of their families, were the victims of\ntorture and extrajudicial killings during those years. They\nseek damages from petitioner based on his alleged au\nthorization of those acts. The narrow question we must\ndecide is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of\n1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71330, 1602 et seq., pro\nvides petitioner with immunity from suit based on actions\ntaken in his official capacity. We hold that the FSIA does\nnot govern the determination of petitioner\u2019s immunity\nfrom suit.\n                             I\n  Respondents are members of the Isaaq clan, which\nincluded well-educated and prosperous Somalis who were\nsubjected to systematic persecution during the 1980\u2019s by\nthe military regime then governing Somalia. They allege\nthat petitioner exercised command and control over mem\n2                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbers of the Somali military forces who tortured, killed, or\narbitrarily detained them or members of their families;\nthat petitioner knew or should have known of the abuses\nperpetrated by his subordinates; and that he aided and\nabetted the commission of these abuses.1 Respondents\u2019\ncomplaint sought damages from petitioner pursuant to the\nTorture Victim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note\nfollowing 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, and the Alien Tort Statute, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71350. Petitioner, who was in charge of Somalia\u2019s\narmed forces before its military regime collapsed, fled\nSomalia in 1991 and is now a resident of Virginia. The\nUnited States has not recognized any entity as the gov\nernment of Somalia since the fall of the military regime.\nSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4.\n   Respondents filed their complaint in November 2004,\nand petitioner promptly moved to dismiss. The District\nCourt stayed the proceedings to give the State Depart\nment an opportunity to provide a statement of interest\nregarding petitioner\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity. Each\nmonth during the ensuing two years, petitioner advised\nthe court that the State Department had the matter \u201c \u2018still\nunder consideration.\u2019 \u201d No. 1:04cv1360 (ED Va., Aug. 1,\n2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. In 2007, having received\nno response from the State Department, the District Court\nreinstated the case on its active docket. The court con\ncluded that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction and\ngranted petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n   The District Court\u2019s decision rested squarely on the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although we do not set out respondents\u2019 allegations in detail, the\n\nDistrict Court\u2019s written opinion contains a comprehensive summary,\ndescribing not only the abuses respondents suffered but also the his\ntorical context in which the abuses occurred, as well as some of the\nattempts to establish a stable government in Somalia in recent years.\nSee No. 1:04cv1360 (ED Va., Aug. 1, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a\u2013\n43a.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a71604,\nand the District Court noted that none of the parties had\nargued that any exception was applicable, App. to Pet. for\nCert. 46a\u201347a. Although characterizing the statute as\nsilent on its applicability to the officials of a foreign state,\nthe District Court followed appellate decisions holding\nthat a foreign state\u2019s sovereign immunity under the Act\nextends to \u201c \u2018an individual acting in his official capacity on\nbehalf of a foreign state,\u2019 \u201d but not to \u201c \u2018an official who acts\nbeyond the scope of his authority.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 47a (quoting\nVelasco v. Government of Indonesia, 370 F. 3d 392, 398,\n399 (CA4 2004)). The court rejected respondents\u2019 argu\nment that petitioner was necessarily acting beyond the\nscope of his authority because he allegedly violated inter\nnational law.3\n   The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District\nCourt\u2019s ruling that the FSIA governs petitioner\u2019s immu\nnity from suit. It acknowledged \u201cthe majority view\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Petitioner argued that, in addition to his immunity under the FSIA,\nthe complaint should be dismissed on a number of other grounds, which\nthe District Court did not reach. See id., at 45a, n. 11.\n  3 Because we hold that the FSIA does not govern whether an individ\n\nual foreign official enjoys immunity from suit, we need not reach\nrespondents\u2019 argument that an official is not immune under the FSIA\nfor acts of torture and extrajudicial killing. See Brief for Respondents\n51\u201353. We note that in determining petitioner had not acted beyond\nthe scope of his authority, the District Court afforded great weight to\nletters from the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to the\nState Department, App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a, in which the TFG sup\nported petitioner\u2019s claim of immunity and stated \u201cthe actions attributed\nto [petitioner] in the lawsuit . . . would have been taken by [petitioner]\nin his official capacities,\u201d App. 104. Although the District Court de\nscribed the TFG as \u201crecognized by the United States as the governing\nbody in Somalia,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a, the United States does not\nrecognize the TFG (or any other entity) as the government of Somalia,\nsee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5.\n4                       SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\namong the Circuits that \u201cthe FSIA applies to individual\nofficials of a foreign state.\u201d 552 F. 3d 371, 378 (CA4\n2009).4 It disagreed with that view, however, and con\ncluded, \u201cbased on the language and structure of the stat\nute, that the FSIA does not apply to individual foreign\ngovernment agents like [petitioner].\u201d Id., at 381.5 Having\nfound that the FSIA does not govern whether petitioner\nenjoys immunity from suit, the Court of Appeals re\nmanded the case for further proceedings, including a\ndetermination of whether petitioner is entitled to immu\nnity under the common law. Id., at 383\u2013384. We granted\ncertiorari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                              II\n   The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity developed as\na matter of common law long before the FSIA was enacted\nin 1976. In Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,\n461 U. S. 480, 486 (1983), we explained that in Schooner\nExchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116 (1812), \u201cChief Jus\ntice Marshall concluded that . . . the United States had\nimpliedly waived jurisdiction over certain activities of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Compare 552 F. 3d, at 381 (holding the FSIA does not govern the\n\nimmunity of individual foreign officials), and Enahoro v. Abubakar, 408\nF. 3d 877, 881\u2013882 (CA7 2005) (same), with Chuidian v. Philippine\nNat. Bank, 912 F. 2d 1095, 1103 (CA9 1990) (concluding that a suit\nagainst an individual official for acts committed in his official capacity\nmust be analyzed under the FSIA), In re Terrorist Attacks on September\n11, 2001, 538 F. 3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008) (same), Keller v.

Central Bank of Jordan, 75 F. 3d 668, 671\n(CADC 1996) (same).\n  5 As an alternative basis for its decision, the Court of Appeals held\n\nthat even if a current official is covered by the FSIA, a former official is\nnot. See 552 F. 3d, at 381\u2013383. Because we agree with the Court of\nAppeals on its broader ground that individual officials are not covered\nby the FSIA, petitioner\u2019s status as a former official is irrelevant to our\nanalysis.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

S., at 486.\n   Following Schooner Exchange, a two-step procedure\ndeveloped for resolving a foreign state\u2019s claim of sovereign\nimmunity, typically asserted on behalf of seized vessels.\nSee, e.g., Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 34\u2013\n36 (1945); Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 587\u2013589 (1943);\nCompania Espanola de Navegacion Maritima, S. A. v. The\nNavemar, 303 U. S. 68, 74\u201375 (1938). Under that proce\ndure, the diplomatic representative of the sovereign could\nrequest a \u201csuggestion of immunity\u201d from the State De\npartment. Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 581. If the request\nwas granted, the district court surrendered its jurisdic\ntion. Id., at 588; see also Hoffman, 324 U. S., at 34. But\n\u201cin the absence of recognition of the immunity by the\nDepartment of State,\u201d a district court \u201chad authority to\ndecide for itself whether all the requisites for such immu\nnity existed.\u201d Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 587; see also\nCompania Espanola, 303 U. S., at 75 (approving judicial\ninquiry into sovereign immunity when the \u201cDepartment of\nState . . . declined to act\u201d); Heaney v. Government of Spain,\n445 F. 2d 501, 503, and n. 2 (CA2 1971) (evaluating sov\nereign immunity when the State Department had not\nresponded to a request for its views). In making that\ndecision, a district court inquired \u201cwhether the ground of\nimmunity is one which it is the established policy of the\n[State Department] to recognize.\u201d Hoffman, 324 U. S., at\n36. Although cases involving individual foreign officials as\ndefendants were rare, the same two-step procedure was\ntypically followed when a foreign official asserted immu\nnity. See, e.g., Heaney, 445 F. 2d, at 504\u2013505; Waltier v.\n6                      SAMANTAR v.

Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 486\u2013487; see also\nLetter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Depart\nment of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B.\nPerlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull.\n984\u2013985 (1952). Under this theory, \u201cimmunity is confined\nto suits involving the foreign sovereign\u2019s public acts, and\ndoes not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state\u2019s\nstrictly commercial acts.\u201d Verlinden, 461 U. S., at 487.\nThis change threw \u201cimmunity determinations into some\ndisarray,\u201d because \u201cpolitical considerations sometimes led\nthe Department to file \u2018suggestions of immunity in cases\nwhere immunity would not have been available under the\nrestrictive theory.\u2019 \u201d Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541\nU. S. 677, 690 (2004) (quoting Verlinden, 461 U.

S., at 487\u2013488. Section 1602 describes the Act\u2019s two\nprimary purposes: (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive\ntheory of sovereign immunity, and (2) to transfer primary\nresponsibility for deciding \u201cclaims of foreign states to\nimmunity\u201d from the State Department to the courts.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 Diplomatic and consular officers could also claim the \u201cspecialized\nimmunities\u201d accorded those officials, Restatement (Second) of Foreign\nRelations Law of the United States \u00a766, Comment b (1964\u20131965)\n(hereinafter Restatement), and officials qualifying as the \u201chead of state\u201d\ncould claim immunity on that basis, see Schooner Exchange v.

We begin with\nthe statute\u2019s text and then consider petitioner\u2019s reliance on\nits history and purpose.\n                              III\n   The FSIA provides that \u201ca foreign state shall be immune\nfrom the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and\nof the States\u201d except as provided in the Act. \u00a71604. Thus,\nif a defendant is a \u201cforeign state\u201d within the meaning of\nthe Act, then the defendant is immune from jurisdiction\nunless one of the exceptions in the Act applies. See\n\u00a7\u00a71605\u20131607 (enumerating exceptions). The Act, if it\napplies, is the \u201csole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a\nforeign state in federal court.\u201d Argentine Republic v.\nAmerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 439 (1989).\nThe question we face in this case is whether an individual\nsued for conduct undertaken in his official capacity is a\n\u201cforeign state\u201d within the meaning of the Act.\n   The Act defines \u201cforeign state\u201d in \u00a71603 as follows:\n        \u201c(a) A \u2018foreign state\u2019 . . . includes a political subdivi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npose,\u201d reads as follows:\n   \u201cThe Congress finds that the determination by United States courts\nof the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such\ncourts would serve the interests of justice and would protect the rights\nof both foreign states and litigants in United States courts. Under\ninternational law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of\nforeign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and\ntheir commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of\njudgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial\nactivities. Claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be\ndecided by courts of the United States and of the States in conformity\nwith the principles set forth in this chapter.\u201d\n8                  SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    sion of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality\n    of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).\n       \u201c(b) An \u2018agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\u2019\n    means any entity\u2014\n       \u201c(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or\n    otherwise, and\n       \u201c(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political\n    subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or\n    other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or\n    political subdivision thereof, and\n       \u201c(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the\n    United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of\n    this title, nor created under the laws of any third\n    country.\u201d\n   The term \u201cforeign state\u201d on its face indicates a body\npolitic that governs a particular territory. See, e.g., Re\nstatement \u00a74 (defining \u201cstate\u201d as \u201can entity that has a\ndefined territory and population under the control of a\ngovernment and that engages in foreign relations\u201d). In\n\u00a71603(a), however, the Act establishes that \u201cforeign state\u201d\nhas a broader meaning, by mandating the inclusion of the\nstate\u2019s political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentali\nties. Then, in \u00a71603(b), the Act specifically delimits what\ncounts as an agency or instrumentality. Petitioner argues\nthat either \u201cforeign state,\u201d \u00a71603(a), or \u201cagency or instru\nmentality,\u201d \u00a71603(b), could be read to include a foreign\nofficial. Although we agree that petitioner\u2019s interpretation\nis literally possible, our analysis of the entire statutory\ntext persuades us that petitioner\u2019s reading is not the\nmeaning that Congress enacted.\n   We turn first to the term \u201cagency or instrumentality of a\nforeign state,\u201d \u00a71603(b). It is true that an individual\nofficial could be an \u201cagency or instrumentality,\u201d if that\nterm is given the meaning of \u201cany thing or person through\nwhich action is accomplished,\u201d In re Terrorist Attacks on\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

But Congress\nhas specifically defined \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d in the\nFSIA, and all of the textual clues in that definition cut\nagainst such a broad construction.\n   First, the statute specifies that \u201c \u2018agency or instrumen\ntality . . .\u2019 means any entity\u201d matching three specified\ncharacteristics, \u00a71603(b) (emphasis added), and \u201centity\u201d\ntypically refers to an organization, rather than an individ\nual. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed. 2009).\nFurthermore, several of the required characteristics apply\nawkwardly, if at all, to individuals. The phrase \u201cseparate\nlegal person, corporate or otherwise,\u201d \u00a71603(b)(1), could\nconceivably refer to a natural person, solely by virtue of\nthe word \u201cperson.\u201d But the phrase \u201cseparate legal person\u201d\ntypically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to\nhold personhood separate from the natural persons who\nare its shareholders or officers. Cf. First Nat. City Bank v.\nBanco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U. S. 611,\n625 (1983) (\u201cSeparate legal personality has been described\nas \u2018an almost indispensable aspect of the public corpora\ntion\u2019 \u201d). It is similarly awkward to refer to a person as an\n\u201corgan\u201d of the foreign state. See \u00a71603(b)(2). And the\nthird part of the definition could not be applied at all to a\nnatural person. A natural person cannot be a citizen of a\nState \u201cas defined in section 1332(c) and (e),\u201d \u00a71603(b)(3),\nbecause those subsections refer to the citizenship of corpo\nrations and estates. Nor can a natural person be \u201ccreated\nunder the laws of any third country.\u201d Ibid.8 Thus, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Petitioner  points out that \u00a71603(b)(3) describes only which defen\ndants cannot be agencies or instrumentalities. He suggests that it\ntherefore tells us nothing about which defendants can be covered by\nthat term. Brief for Petitioner 46. Even if so, reading \u00a71603(b) as\npetitioner suggests would leave us with the odd result that a corpora\ntion that is the citizen of a state is excluded from the definition under\n\u00a71603(b)(3), and thus not immune, whereas a natural person who is the\ncitizen of a state is not excluded, and thus retains his immunity.\n10                      SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nterms Congress chose simply do not evidence the intent to\ninclude individual officials within the meaning of \u201cagency\nor instrumentality.\u201d9 Cf. Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538\nU. S. 468, 474 (2003) (describing \u00a71603(b) as containing\n\u201cindicia that Congress had corporate formalities in mind\u201d).\n   Petitioner proposes a second textual route to including\nan official within the meaning of \u201cforeign state.\u201d He ar\ngues that the definition of \u201cforeign state\u201d in \u00a71603(a) sets\nout a nonexhaustive list that \u201cincludes\u201d political subdivi\nsions and agencies or instrumentalities but is not so lim\nited. See Brief for Petitioner 22\u201323. It is true that use of\nthe word \u201cinclude\u201d can signal that the list that follows is\nmeant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.10 And, to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Nor does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress\n\nintended the term \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d to include individuals.\nOn the contrary, the legislative history, like the statute, speaks in\nterms of entities. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131487, p. 15 (1976) (here\ninafter H. R. Rep.) (\u201cThe first criterion, that the entity be a separate\nlegal person, is intended to include a corporation, association, founda\ntion, or any other entity which, under the law of the foreign state where\nit was created, can sue or be sued in its own name\u201d).\n   JUSTICE SCALIA may well be correct that it is not strictly necessary to\nconfirm our reading of the statutory text by consulting the legislative\nhistory, see post, at 1\u20132 (opinion concurring in judgment). But as the\nCourt explained some years ago in an opinion authored by Justice\nWhite:\n   \u201cAs for the propriety of using legislative history at all, common sense\nsuggests that inquiry benefits from reviewing additional information\nrather than ignoring it. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, \u2018[w]here the\nmind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every\nthing from which aid can be derived.\u2019 United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch\n358, 386 (1805). Legislative history materials are not generally so\nmisleading that jurists should never employ them in a good-faith effort\nto discern legislative intent. Our precedents demonstrate that the\nCourt\u2019s practice of utilizing legislative history reaches well into its past.\nSee, e.g., Wallace v.

But even if the list in \u00a71603(a)\nis merely illustrative, it still suggests that \u201cforeign state\u201d\ndoes not encompass officials, because the types of defen\ndants listed are all entities. See Russell Motor Car Co. v.\nUnited States, 261 U. S. 514, 519 (1923) (\u201c[A] word may be\nknown by the company it keeps\u201d).\n   Moreover, elsewhere in the FSIA Congress expressly\nmentioned officials when it wished to count their acts as\nequivalent to those of the foreign state, which suggests\nthat officials are not included within the unadorned term\n\u201cforeign state.\u201d Cf. Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.\n85, 103 (2007) (\u201cDrawing meaning from silence is particu\nlarly inappropriate . . . [when] Congress has shown that it\nknows how to [address an issue] in express terms\u201d). For\nexample, Congress provided an exception from the general\ngrant of immunity for cases in which \u201cmoney damages are\nsought against a foreign state\u201d for an injury in the United\nStates \u201ccaused by the tortious act or omission of that\nforeign state or of any official or employee of that foreign\nstate while acting within the scope of his office.\u201d\n\u00a71605(a)(5) (emphasis added). The same reference to\nofficials is made in a similar, later enacted exception. See\n28 U. S. C. A. \u00a71605A(a)(1) (Supp. 2009) (eliminating\nimmunity for suits \u201cin which money damages are sought\nagainst a foreign state\u201d for certain acts \u201cengaged in by an\nofficial, employee, or agent of such foreign state while\nacting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or\nagency\u201d); see also \u00a71605A(c) (creating a cause of action\nagainst the \u201cforeign state\u201d and \u201cany official, employee, or\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u00a747.7, p. 305 (7th ed. 2007) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018includes\u2019 is usually a term of \n\nenlargement, and not of limitation\u201d (some internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)). \n\n12                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nagent\u201d thereof).11 If the term \u201cforeign state\u201d by definition\nincludes an individual acting within the scope of his office,\nthe phrase \u201cor of any official or employee . . .\u201d in 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71605(a)(5) would be unnecessary. See Dole Food\nCo., 538 U. S., at 476\u2013477 (\u201c[W]e should not construe the\nstatute in a manner that is strained and, at the same\ntime, would render a statutory term superfluous\u201d).\n  Other provisions of the statute also point away from\nreading \u201cforeign state\u201d to include foreign officials. Con\ngress made no express mention of service of process on\nindividuals in \u00a71608(a), which governs service upon a\nforeign state or political subdivision. Although some of the\nmethods listed could be used to serve individuals\u2014for\nexample, by delivery \u201cin accordance with an applicable\ninternational convention,\u201d \u00a71608(a)(2)\u2014the methods\nspecified are at best very roundabout ways of serving an\nindividual official. Furthermore, Congress made specific\nremedial choices for different types of defendants. See\n\u00a71606 (allowing punitive damages for an agency or in\nstrumentality but not for a foreign state); \u00a71610 (affording\na plaintiff greater rights to attach the property of an\nagency or instrumentality as compared to the property of a\nforeign state). By adopting petitioner\u2019s reading of \u201cforeign\nstate,\u201d we would subject claims against officials to the\nmore limited remedies available in suits against states,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Petitioner argues that \u00a71605A abrogates immunity for certain acts\n\nby individual officials, which would be superfluous if the officials were\nnot otherwise immune. See Brief for Petitioner 41\u201343. But the import\nof \u00a71605A is precisely the opposite. First, \u00a71605A(a)(1) eliminates the\nimmunity of the state for certain acts of its officers; it says a \u201cforeign\nstate shall not be immune\u201d in a suit \u201cin which money damages are\nsought against a foreign state.\u201d As it does not expressly refer to the\nimmunity of individual officers, it adds nothing to petitioner\u2019s argu\nment. Second, the creation of a cause of action against both the \u201cfor\neign state\u201d and \u201cany official, employee, or agent\u201d thereof, \u00a71605A(c),\nreinforces the idea that \u201cforeign state\u201d does not by definition include\nforeign officials.\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     13\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwithout so much as a whisper from Congress on the sub\nject. (And if we were instead to adopt petitioner\u2019s other\ntextual argument, we would subject those claims to the\ndifferent, more expansive, remedial scheme for agencies).\nThe Act\u2019s careful calibration of remedies among the listed\ntypes of defendants suggests that Congress did not mean\nto cover other types of defendants never mentioned in the\ntext.\n  In sum, \u201c[w]e do not . . . construe statutory phrases in\nisolation; we read statutes as a whole.\u201d United States v.\nMorton, 467 U. S. 822, 828 (1984). Reading the FSIA as a\nwhole, there is nothing to suggest we should read \u201cforeign\nstate\u201d in \u00a71603(a) to include an official acting on behalf of\nthe foreign state, and much to indicate that this meaning\nwas not what Congress enacted.12 The text does not ex\npressly foreclose petitioner\u2019s reading, but it supports the\nview of respondents and the United States that the Act\ndoes not address an official\u2019s claim to immunity.\n                             IV\n  Petitioner argues that the FSIA is best read to cover his\nclaim to immunity because of its history and purpose. As\ndiscussed at the outset, one of the primary purposes of the\nFSIA was to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign\nimmunity, which Congress recognized as consistent with\nextant international law. See \u00a71602. We have observed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Nor is it the case that the FSIA\u2019s \u201clegislative history does not even\nhint of an intent to exclude individual officials,\u201d Chuidian, 912 F. 2d, at\n1101. The legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend\nthe FSIA to address position-based individual immunities such as\ndiplomatic and consular immunity. H. R. Rep., at 12 (\u201cThe bill is not\nintended . . . . to affect either diplomatic or consular immunity\u201d). It also\nsuggests that general \u201cofficial immunity\u201d is something separate from\nthe subject of the bill. See id., at 23 (\u201cThe bill does not attempt to deal\nwith questions of discovery. . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a\ndiplomat in the United States or a high-ranking official of a foreign\ngovernment, diplomatic and official immunity would apply\u201d).\n14                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat a related purpose was \u201ccodification of international\nlaw at the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment,\u201d Permanent\nMission of India to United Nations v. City of New York,\n551 U. S. 193, 199 (2007), and have examined the relevant\ncommon law and international practice when interpreting\nthe Act, id., at 200\u2013201. Because of this relationship\nbetween the Act and the common law that it codified,\npetitioner argues that we should construe the FSIA con\nsistently with the common law regarding individual im\nmunity, which\u2014in petitioner\u2019s view\u2014was coextensive with\nthe law of state immunity and always immunized a for\neign official for acts taken on behalf of the foreign state.\nEven reading the Act in light of Congress\u2019 purpose of\ncodifying state sovereign immunity, however, we do not\nthink that the Act codified the common law with respect to\nthe immunity of individual officials.\n  The canon of construction that statutes should be inter\npreted consistently with the common law helps us inter\npret a statute that clearly covers a field formerly governed\nby the common law.13 But the canon does not help us to\ndecide the antecedent question whether, when a statute\u2019s\ncoverage is ambiguous, Congress intended the statute to\ngovern a particular field\u2014in this case, whether Congress\nintended the FSIA to supersede the common law of official\nimmunity.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Congress \u201cis understood to legislate against a background of com\n\nmon-law . . . principles,\u201d Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino,\n501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991), and when a statute covers an issue previ\nously governed by the common law, we interpret the statute with the\npresumption that Congress intended to retain the substance of the\ncommon law. See Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U. S. 779, 783 (1952)\n(\u201cStatutes which invade the common law . . . are to be read with a\npresumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar\nprinciples, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident\u201d).\n  14 We find similarly inapposite petitioner\u2019s invocation of the canon\n\nthat a statute should be interpreted in compliance with international\nlaw, see Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 2 Cranch 64, 118 (1804),\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Petitioner argues that because state and official immu\nnities are coextensive, Congress must have codified official\nimmunity when it codified state immunity. See Brief for\nPetitioner 26\u201330. But the relationship between a state\u2019s\nimmunity and an official\u2019s immunity is more complicated\nthan petitioner suggests, although we need not and do not\nresolve the dispute among the parties as to the precise\nscope of an official\u2019s immunity at common law. The very\nauthority to which petitioner points us, and which we have\npreviously found instructive, see, e.g., Permanent Mission,\n551 U. S., at 200, states that the immunity of individual\nofficials is subject to a caveat not applicable to any of the\nother entities or persons15 to which the foreign state\u2019s\nimmunity extends. The Restatement provides that the\n\u201cimmunity of a foreign state . . . extends to . . . any other\npublic minister, official, or agent of the state with respect\nto acts performed in his official capacity if the effect of\nexercising jurisdiction would be to enforce a rule of law\nagainst the state.\u201d Restatement \u00a766 (emphasis added).16\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nand his argument that foreign relations and the reciprocal protection of\nUnited States officials abroad would be undermined if we do not adopt\nhis reading of the Act. Because we are not deciding that the FSIA bars\npetitioner\u2019s immunity but rather that the Act does not address the\nquestion, we need not determine whether declining to afford immunity\nto petitioner would be consistent with international law.\n   15 The Restatement does not apply this caveat to the head of state,\n\nhead of government, or foreign minister. See Restatement \u00a766.\nWhether petitioner may be entitled to head of state immunity, or any\nother immunity, under the common law is a question we leave open for\nremand. See 552 F. 3d 371, 383 (CA4 2009). We express no view on\nwhether Restatement \u00a766 correctly sets out the scope of the common\nlaw immunity applicable to current or former foreign officials.\n   16 Respondents contend that this caveat refers to \u201cthe compulsive\n\neffect of the judgment on the state,\u201d Brief for Respondents 42, but\npetitioner disputes that meaning, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17\u201318. We\nneed not resolve their dispute, as it is enough for present purposes that\nthe Restatement indicates a foreign official\u2019s immunity may turn upon\na requirement not applicable to any other type of defendant.\n16                     SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAnd historically, the Government sometimes suggested\nimmunity under the common law for individual officials\neven when the foreign state did not qualify. See, e.g.,\nGreenspan v. Crosbie, No. 74 Civ. 4734 (GLG), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (SDNY, Nov. 23, 1976). There is therefore little rea\nson to presume that when Congress set out to codify state\nimmunity, it must also have, sub silentio, intended to\ncodify official immunity.\n  Petitioner urges that a suit against an official must\nalways be equivalent to a suit against the state because\nacts taken by a state official on behalf of a state are acts of\nthe state. See Brief for Petitioner 26. We have recog\nnized, in the context of the act of state doctrine, that an\nofficial\u2019s acts can be considered the acts of the foreign\nstate, and that \u201cthe courts of one country will not sit in\njudgment\u201d of those acts when done within the territory of\nthe foreign state. See Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U. S.\n250, 252, 254 (1897). Although the act of state doctrine is\ndistinct from immunity, and instead \u201cprovides foreign\nstates with a substantive defense on the merits,\u201d Altmann,\n541 U. S., at 700, we do not doubt that in some circum\nstances the immunity of the foreign state extends to an\nindividual for acts taken in his official capacity. But it\ndoes not follow from this premise that Congress intended\nto codify that immunity in the FSIA. It hardly furthers\nCongress\u2019 purpose of \u201cclarifying the rules that judges\nshould apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims,\u201d id.,\nat 699, to lump individual officials in with foreign states\nwithout so much as a word spelling out how and when\nindividual officials are covered.17\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 The courts of appeals have had to develop, in the complete absence\n\nof any statutory text, rules governing when an official is entitled to\nimmunity under the FSIA. For example, Courts of Appeals have\napplied the rule that foreign sovereign immunity extends to an individ\nual official \u201cfor acts committed in his official capacity\u201d but not to \u201can\nofficial who acts beyond the scope of his authority.\u201d Chuidian, 912\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner would have a stronger case if there were any\nindication that Congress\u2019 intent to enact a comprehensive\nsolution for suits against states extended to suits against\nindividual officials. But to the extent Congress contem\nplated the Act\u2019s effect upon officials at all, the evidence\npoints in the opposite direction. As we have already men\ntioned, the legislative history points toward an intent to\nleave official immunity outside the scope of the Act. See\nn. 12, supra. And although questions of official immunity\ndid arise in the pre-FSIA period, they were few and far\nbetween.18 The immunity of officials simply was not the\nparticular problem to which Congress was responding\nwhen it enacted the FSIA. The FSIA was adopted, rather,\nto address \u201ca modern world where foreign state enter\nprises are every day participants in commercial activities,\u201d\nand to assure litigants that decisions regarding claims\nagainst states and their enterprises \u201care made on purely\nlegal grounds.\u201d H. R. Rep., at 7. We have been given no\nreason to believe that Congress saw as a problem, or\nwanted to eliminate, the State Department\u2019s role in de\nterminations regarding individual official immunity.19\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nF. 2d, at 1103, 1106. That may be correct as a matter of common-law\nprinciples, but it does not derive from any clarification or codification\nby Congress. Furthermore, if Congress intended the FSIA to reach\nindividuals, one would expect the Act to have addressed whether former\nofficials are covered, an issue it settled with respect to instrumentali\nties, see Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U. S. 468, 478 (2003)\n(\u201c[I]nstrumentality status [must] be determined at the time suit is\nfiled\u201d).\n   18 A study that attempted to gather all of the State Department deci\n\nsions related to sovereign immunity from the adoption of the restrictive\ntheory in 1952 to the enactment of the FSIA reveals only four decisions\nrelated to official immunity, and two related to head of state immunity,\nout of a total of 110 decisions.

YOUSUF\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Finally, our reading of the FSIA will not \u201cin effect make\nthe statute optional,\u201d as some Courts of Appeals have\nfeared, by allowing litigants through \u201cartful pleading . . .\nto take advantage of the Act\u2019s provisions or, alternatively,\nchoose to proceed under the old common law,\u201d Chuidian v.\nPhilippine Nat. Bank, 912 F. 2d 1095, 1102 (CA9 1990).\nEven if a suit is not governed by the Act, it may still be\nbarred by foreign sovereign immunity under the common\nlaw. And not every suit can successfully be pleaded\nagainst an individual official alone.20 Even when a plain\ntiff names only a foreign official, it may be the case that\nthe foreign state itself, its political subdivision, or an\nagency or instrumentality is a required party, because\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nof the State Department. H. R. Rep., at 6. The Department sought and\nsupported the elimination of its role with respect to claims against\nforeign states and their agencies or instrumentalities. See Hearings on\nH. R. 11315 before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and\nGovernmental Relations of the House of Representatives Committee on\nthe Judiciary, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 34 (1976) (testimony of Monroe\nLeigh, Legal Adviser, Dept. of State) (\u201c[I]t is our judgment . . . that the\nadvantages of having a judicial determination greatly outweigh the\nadvantage of being able to intervene in a lawsuit\u201d). But the Depart\nment has from the time of the FSIA\u2019s enactment understood the Act to\nleave intact the Department\u2019s role in official immunity cases. See\nDigest 1020 (\u201cThese decisions [of the Department regarding the immu\nnity of officials] may be of some future significance, because the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act does not deal with the immunity of individ\nual officials, but only that of foreign states and their political subdivi\nsions, agencies and instrumentalities\u201d).\n   20 Furthermore, a plaintiff seeking to sue a foreign official will not be\n\nable to rely on the Act\u2019s service of process and jurisdictional provisions.\nThus, a plaintiff will have to establish that the district court has\npersonal jurisdiction over an official without the benefit of the FSIA\nprovision that makes personal jurisdiction over a foreign state auto\nmatic when an exception to immunity applies and service of process has\nbeen accomplished in accordance with 28 U. S. C. \u00a71608. See \u00a71330(b)\n(\u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim\nfor relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsec\ntion (a),\u201d i.e., claims for which the foreign state is not entitled to immu\nnity, \u201cwhere service has been made under section 1608 of this title\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat party has \u201can interest relating to the subject of the\naction\u201d and \u201cdisposing of the action in the person\u2019s absence\nmay . . . as a practical matter impair or impede the per\nson\u2019s ability to protect the interest.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n19(a)(1)(B). If this is the case, and the entity is immune\nfrom suit under the FSIA, the district court may have to\ndismiss the suit, regardless of whether the official is im\nmune or not under the common law. See Republic of\nPhilippines v. Pimentel, 553 U. S. 851, 867 (2008)\n(\u201c[W]here sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims\nof the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action\nmust be ordered where there is a potential for injury to\nthe interests of the absent sovereign\u201d). Or it may be the\ncase that some actions against an official in his official\ncapacity should be treated as actions against the foreign\nstate itself, as the state is the real party in interest. Cf.\nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 166 (1985) (\u201c[A]n\nofficial-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to\nbe treated as a suit against the entity. It is not a suit\nagainst the official personally, for the real party in inter\nest is the entity\u201d (citation omitted)).\n   We are thus not persuaded that our construction of the\nstatute\u2019s text should be affected by the risk that plaintiffs\nmay use artful pleading to attempt to select between\napplication of the FSIA or the common law. And we think\nthis case, in which respondents have sued petitioner in his\npersonal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets,\nis properly governed by the common law because it is not a\nclaim against a foreign state as the Act defines that term.\nAlthough Congress clearly intended to supersede the\ncommon-law regime for claims against foreign states, we\nfind nothing in the statute\u2019s origin or aims to indicate that\nCongress similarly wanted to codify the law of foreign\nofficial immunity.\n20                 SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF \n\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              V\n\n   Our review of the text, purpose, and history of the FSIA\nleads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals cor\nrectly held the FSIA does not govern petitioner\u2019s claim of\nimmunity. The Act therefore did not deprive the District\nCourt of subject-matter jurisdiction. We emphasize, how\never, the narrowness of our holding. Whether petitioner\nmay be entitled to immunity under the common law, and\nwhether he may have other valid defenses to the grave\ncharges against him, are matters to be addressed in the\nfirst instance by the District Court on remand. The judg\nment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

BASHE \n\n            ABDI YOUSUF ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                         [June 1, 2010]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.\n   The Court\u2019s admirably careful textual analysis, ante, at\n7\u201313, demonstrates that the term \u201cforeign state\u201d in the\nprovision \u201ca foreign state shall be immune from the juris\ndiction of the courts of the United States and of the\nStates,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71604, does not include foreign offi\ncials. Yet the Court insists on adding legislative history to\nits analysis. I could understand that (though not agree\nwith it) if, in the absence of supposed legislative-history\nsupport, the Court would reach a different result. Or even\nif there was something in the legislative history that\nclearly contradicted the Court\u2019s result, and had to be\nexplained away. That is not the situation here (or at least\nthe Court\u2019s opinion does not think it to be so). The Court\nassures us, however (if this could be thought assurance),\nthat legislative history is \u201c \u2018not generally so misleading\u2019 \u201d\nthat it should \u201c \u2018never\u2019 \u201d be used. Ante, at 10, n. 9 (quoting\nWisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597,\n611\u2013612, n. 4 (1991)). Surely that is damning by faint\npraise. And the Court\u2019s mention of the past practice of\nusing legislative history, ante, at 10, n. 9, does not support\nthe Court\u2019s use of it today. The past practice was \u201cnot the\npractice of using legislative history for the purpose of\ngiving authoritative content to the meaning of a statutory\ntext,\u201d Mortier, supra, at 622 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\n2                   SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\njudgment).\n   The Court\u2019s introduction of legislative history serves no\npurpose except needlessly to inject into the opinion a mode\nof analysis that not all of the Justices consider valid. And\nit does so, to boot, in a fashion that does not isolate the\nsuperfluous legislative history in a section that those of us\nwho disagree categorically with its use, or at least dis\nagree with its superfluous use, can decline to join. I there\nfore do not join the opinion, and concur only in the result.\n   The Court relies on legislative history to support three\nof its positions. First, after explaining why the phrase\n\u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d in the definition of \u201cforeign\nstate,\u201d see \u00a71603(a), (b), does not refer to natural persons,\nante, at 9\u201310, the Court says \u201c[n]or does anything in the\nlegislative history suggest that Congress intended the\nterm \u2018agency or instrumentality\u2019 to include individuals,\u201d\nante, at 10, n. 9. According to the Court, \u201cthe legislative\nhistory, like the statute, speaks in terms of entities.\u201d Ibid.\nApparently, the legislative history must be consulted, not\nto show that it supports the Court\u2019s textual analysis, or\neven to explain why its seeming contradiction of the\nCourt\u2019s analysis is inconsequential, but to show nothing\nmore than that it contains the same ambiguous language\nas the text. This is beyond all reason.\n   Second, after concluding its review of the statute\u2019s text,\nthe Court states that the \u201clegislative history makes clear\nthat Congress did not intend the [Foreign Sovereign Im\nmunities Act of 1976] to address position-based individual\nimmunities such as diplomatic and consular immunity,\u201d\nante, at 13, n. 12. See also ante, at 17. It cites for this\nproposition a House Committee Report that we have no\nreason to believe was read (much less approved) by the\nSenate\u2014or, indeed, by the Members of the House who\nwere not on the Committee\u2014or even, for that matter, by\nthe members of the Committee, who never voted on the\nReport. In any case, the quoted excerpt does not address\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cposition-based individual immunities\u201d in general but only\n\u201cconsular and diplomatic immunity,\u201d which is not at issue\nhere. Unless consular and diplomatic immunity, on the\none hand, and, on the other hand, what is at issue here\u2014\nstate-agent immunity\u2014are always treated the same\n(which I doubt and the Court does not attempt to estab\nlish), the passage contributes nothing to analysis of the\npresent case.\n   The same footnote also quotes a portion of the same\nHouse Report as follows:\n    \u201c \u2018The bill does not attempt to deal with questions of\n    discovery. . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a diplo\n    mat in the United States or a high-ranking official of\n    a foreign government, diplomatic and official immu\n    nity would apply.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 13, n. 12.\nIf anything, this passage cuts against the Court\u2019s result.\nThe two sentences omitted from the above quotation read\nas follows:\n    \u201cExisting law appears to be adequate in this area. For\n    example, if a private plaintiff sought the production of\n    sensitive governmental documents of a foreign state,\n    concepts of governmental privilege would apply.\u201d\n    H. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131487, p. 23 (1976).\nThus, the House Report makes it clear that the bill\u2019s\nfailure to deal with discovery applies to both discovery\nagainst sovereigns and discovery against foreign officials.\nBut the latter would have been unnecessary if the bill\ndealt only with sovereigns. The implication (if any) is that\nthe bill\u2019s provisions regarding immunity from suit apply to\nboth sovereigns and foreign officials.\n  Third, and finally, the Court points to legislative history\nto establish the purpose of the statute. See ante, at 17,\nand n. 19. This is particularly puzzling, because the en\nacted statutory text itself includes findings and a declara\n4                  SAMANTAR v. YOUSUF\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntion of purpose\u2014the very same purpose (surprise!) that\nthe Court finds evidenced in the legislative history. See\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71602. To make matters worse, the Court\nitself notes this statutory declaration of purpose twice\nearlier, in the body of its opinion, see ante, at 6, 13. If\nthose textual references to the statute itself were deleted,\nthe footnoted citation of legislative history would at least\nperform some function. As it is, however, it adds nothing\nexcept the demonstration of assiduous law-clerk research.\n   It should be no cause for wonder that, upon careful\nexamination, all of the opinion\u2019s excerpts from legislative\nhistory turn out to be, at best, nonprobative or entirely\nduplicative of text. After all, legislative history is almost\nnever the real reason for the Court\u2019s decision\u2014and make\nweights do not deserve a lot of the Court\u2019s time.\n</pre>",
