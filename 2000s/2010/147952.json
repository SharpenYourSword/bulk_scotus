A.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u2013337.      Argued April 21, 2010\u2014Decided June 7, 2010\nPetitioner Krupski sought compensation for injuries she suffered on a\n  cruise ship. Her passenger ticket, which was issued by Costa Cruise\n  Lines, identified respondent Costa Crociere S. p. A. as the carrier; re\n  quired an injured party to submit to the carrier or its agent written\n  notice of a claim; required any lawsuit to be filed within one year of\n  the injury; and designated a specific Federal District Court as the ex\n  clusive forum for lawsuits such as Krupski\u2019s. The front of the ticket\n  listed Costa Cruise\u2019s Florida address and made references to \u201cCosta\n  Cruises.\u201d After Krupski\u2019s attorney notified Costa Cruise of her\n  claims but did not reach a settlement, Krupski filed a diversity negli\n  gence action against Costa Cruise. Over the next several months\u2014\n  after the limitations period had expired\u2014Costa Cruise brought Costa\n  Crociere\u2019s existence to Krupski\u2019s attention three times, including in\n  its motion for summary judgment, in which it stated that Costa Cro\n  ciere was the proper defendant. Krupski responded and moved to\n  amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defendant. The Dis\n  trict Court denied Costa Cruise\u2019s summary judgment motion without\n  prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend. After she served\n  Costa Crociere with an amended complaint, the court dismissed\n  Costa Cruise from the case. Thereafter, Costa Crociere\u2014represented\n  by the same counsel as Costa Cruise\u2014moved to dismiss, contending\n  that the amended complaint did not satisfy the requirements of Fed\n  eral Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), which governs when an amended\n  pleading \u201crelates back\u201d to the date of a timely filed original pleading\n  and is thus timely even though it was filed outside an applicable limi\n  tations period. The Rule requires, inter alia, that within the Rule\n  4(m) 120-day period for service after a complaint is filed, the newly\n  named defendant \u201cknew or should have known that the action would\n2                KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper\n    party\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The District Court found this\n    condition fatal to Krupski\u2019s attempt to relate back. It concluded that\n    she had not made a mistake about the proper party\u2019s identity be\n    cause, although Costa Cruise had disclosed Costa Crociere\u2019s role in\n    several court filings, she nonetheless delayed for months filing an\n    amended complaint. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that\n    Krupski either knew or should have known of Costa Crociere\u2019s iden\n    tity as a potential party because she furnished the ticket identifying\n    it to her counsel well before the limitations period ended. It was\n    therefore appropriate to treat her as having chosen to sue one poten\n    tial party over another. Additionally, the court held that relation\n    back was not appropriate because of Krupski\u2019s undue delay in seek\n    ing to amend the complaint.\nHeld: Relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party\n to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending party\u2019s\n knowledge or timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading. Pp. 7\u201318.\n    (a) The Rule\u2019s text does not support the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision\n to rely on the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge in denying relation back. The\n question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or\n should have known Costa Crociere\u2019s identity as the proper defendant,\n but whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known during the\n Rule 4(m) period that it would have been named as the defendant but\n for an error. The plaintiff\u2019s information is relevant only if it bears on\n the defendant\u2019s understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mis\n take regarding the proper party\u2019s identity. It would be error to con\n flate knowledge of a party\u2019s existence with the absence of mistake.\n That a plaintiff knows of a party\u2019s existence does not preclude her\n from making a mistake with respect to that party\u2019s identity. Making\n a deliberate choice to sue one party over another while understand\n ing the factual and legal differences between the two parties may be\n the antithesis of making a mistake, but that does not mean that any\n time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to\n sue the wrong one, the proper defendant could reasonably believe\n that the plaintiff made no mistake. A plaintiff might know that the\n prospective defendant exists but nonetheless choose to sue a different\n defendant based on a misunderstanding about the proper party\u2019s\n identity. That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice should not fore\n close a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied. This read\n ing is consistent with relation back\u2019s purpose of balancing the defen\n dant\u2019s interests protected by the statute of limitations with the\n preference of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and\n Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their merits. It is also\n consistent with the history of Rule 15(c)(1)(C). And it is not fore\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nclosed by Nelson v. Adams USA, Inc., 529 U. S. 460. Pp. 7\u201313.\n   (b) The Eleventh Circuit also erred in ruling that Krupski\u2019s undue\ndelay in seeking to file, and in eventually filing, an amended com\nplaint justified its denial of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C). The\nRule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation\nback, and the plaintiff\u2019s diligence is not among them. Moreover, it\nmandates relation back once its requirements are satisfied; it does\nnot leave that decision to the district court\u2019s equitable discretion. Its\nmandatory nature is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry\nunder Rule 15(a), which gives a district court discretion to decide\nwhether to grant a motion to amend a pleading before trial. See\nFoman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182. Rule 15(c)(1)(C) permits a court\nto examine a plaintiff\u2019s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but only\nto the extent the plaintiff\u2019s postfiling conduct informs the prospective\ndefendant\u2019s understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a\n\u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s post\nfiling conduct is otherwise immaterial to the relation-back question.\nPp. 13\u201315.\n   (c) Under these principles, the courts below erred in denying rela\ntion back. Because the original complaint (of which Costa Crociere\nhad constructive notice) made clear that Krupski meant to sue the\ncompany that \u201cowned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled\u201d\nthe ship on which she was injured and also indicated (mistakenly)\nthat Costa Cruise performed those roles, Costa Crociere should have\nknown that it avoided suit within the limitations period only because\nof Krupski\u2019s misunderstanding about which \u201cCosta\u201d entity was in\ncharge of the ship\u2014clearly a \u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s\nidentity.\u201d That Krupski may have known the ticket\u2019s contents does\nnot foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood cru\ncial facts regarding the two companies\u2019 identities. Especially because\nthe face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding,\nrespondent\u2019s contention that it was entitled to think she made no\nmistake is not persuasive. Moreover, respondent has articulated no\nstrategy that it could reasonably have thought Krupski was pursuing\nin suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief. Noth\ning in Krupski\u2019s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that\nshe failed to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a\nmistake. The interrelationship between Costa Cruise and Costa Cro\nciere and their similar names heighten the expectation that Costa\nCrociere should suspect a mistake when Costa Cruise is named in a\ncomplaint actually describing Costa Crociere\u2019s activities. In addition,\nCosta Crociere\u2019s own actions contributed to passenger confusion over\n\u201cthe proper party\u201d: The front of the ticket advertises that \u201cCosta\nCruises\u201d has achieved a certification of quality without clarifying\n4                KRUPSKI v.

And as shown in similar lawsuits,\n    Costa Crociere is evidently well aware that the difference between it\n    and Costa Cruise can be confusing for passengers. Pp. 15\u201318.\n330 Fed.

Where an amended pleading changes a party\nor a party\u2019s name, the Rule requires, among other things,\nthat \u201cthe party to be brought in by amendment . . . knew\nor should have known that the action would have been\nbrought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C). In this case, the Court\nof Appeals held that Rule 15(c) was not satisfied because\nthe plaintiff knew or should have known of the proper\ndefendant before filing her original complaint. The court\nalso held that relation back was not appropriate because\nthe plaintiff had unduly delayed in seeking to amend. We\nhold that relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on\nwhat the party to be added knew or should have known,\nnot on the amending party\u2019s knowledge or its timeliness in\nseeking to amend the pleading. Accordingly, we reverse\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n2            KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P.

Upon her\nreturn home, she acquired counsel and began the process\nof seeking compensation for her injuries. Krupski\u2019s pas\nsenger ticket\u2014which explained that it was the sole con\ntract between each passenger and the carrier, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 37a\u2014included a variety of requirements for\nobtaining damages for an injury suffered on board one of\nthe carrier\u2019s ships. The ticket identified the carrier as\n    \u201cCosta Crociere S. p. A., an Italian corporation, and all\n    Vessels and other ships owned, chartered, operated,\n    marketed or provided by Costa Crociere, S. p. A., and\n    all officers, staff members, crew members, independ\n    ent contractors, medical providers, concessionaires, pi\n    lots, suppliers, agents and assigns onboard said Ves\n    sels, and the manufacturers of said Vessels and all\n    their component parts.\u201d Id., at 27a.\nThe ticket required an injured party to submit \u201cwritten\nnotice of the claim with full particulars . . . to the carrier\nor its duly authorized agent within 185 days after the date\nof injury.\u201d Id., at 28a. The ticket further required any\nlawsuit to be \u201cfiled within one year after the date of in\njury\u201d and to be \u201cserved upon the carrier within 120 days\nafter filing.\u201d Ibid. For cases arising from voyages depart\ning from or returning to a United States port in which the\namount in controversy exceeded $75,000, the ticket desig\nnated the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida in Broward County, Florida, as the\nexclusive forum for a lawsuit. Id., at 36a. The ticket\nextended the \u201cdefenses, limitations and exceptions . . . that\nmay be invoked by the CARRIER\u201d to \u201call persons who may\nact on behalf of the CARRIER or on whose behalf the\nCARRIER may act,\u201d including \u201cthe CARRIER\u2019s parents,\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

V.,\u201d identi\nfied as the \u201csales and marketing agent for the CARRIER\nand the issuer of this Passage Ticket Contract.\u201d Id., at\n29a. The front of the ticket listed Costa Cruise Lines\u2019\naddress in Florida and stated that an entity called \u201cCosta\nCruises\u201d was \u201cthe first cruise company in the world\u201d to\nobtain a certain certification of quality. Id., at 25a.\n   On July 2, 2007, Krupski\u2019s counsel notified Costa Cruise\nLines of Krupski\u2019s claims. App. 69\u201370. On July 9, 2007,\nthe claims administrator for Costa Cruise requested addi\ntional information from Krupski \u201c[i]n order to facilitate\nour future attempts to achieve a pre-litigation settlement.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\u201324a. The parties were unable to\nreach a settlement, however, and on February 1, 2008\u2014\nthree weeks before the 1-year limitations period expired\u2014\nKrupski filed a negligence action against Costa Cruise,\ninvoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal District\nCourt for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint\nalleged that Costa Cruise \u201cowned, operated, managed,\nsupervised and controlled\u201d the ship on which Krupski had\ninjured herself; that Costa Cruise had extended to its\npassengers an invitation to enter onto the ship; and that\nCosta Cruise owed Krupski a duty of care, which it\nbreached by failing to take steps that would have pre\nvented her accident. App. 23\u201326. The complaint further\nstated that venue was proper under the passenger ticket\u2019s\nforum selection clause and averred that, by the July 2007\nnotice of her claims, Krupski had complied with the\nticket\u2019s presuit requirements. Id., at 23. Krupski served\nCosta Cruise on February 4, 2008.\n   Over the next several months\u2014after the limitations\nperiod had expired\u2014Costa Cruise brought Costa Croci\nere\u2019s existence to Krupski\u2019s attention three times. First,\non February 25, 2008, Costa Cruise filed its answer, as\n4           KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nserting that it was not the proper defendant, as it was\nmerely the North American sales and marketing agent for\nCosta Crociere, which was the actual carrier and vessel\noperator. Id., at 31. Second, on March 20, 2008, Costa\nCruise listed Costa Crociere as an interested party in its\ncorporate disclosure statement. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.\nFinally, on May 6, 2008, Costa Cruise moved for summary\njudgment, again stating that Costa Crociere was the\nproper defendant. App. 5, 33\u201338.\n   On June 13, 2008, Krupski responded to Costa Cruise\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment, arguing for limited discov\nery to determine whether Costa Cruise should be dis\nmissed. According to Krupski, the following sources of\ninformation led her to believe Costa Cruise was the re\nsponsible party: The travel documents prominently identi\nfied Costa Cruise and gave its Florida address; Costa\nCruise\u2019s Web site listed Costa Cruise in Florida as the\nUnited States office for the Italian company Costa Croci\nere; and the Web site of the Florida Department of State\nlisted Costa Cruise as the only \u201cCosta\u201d company registered\nto do business in that State. Id., at 43\u201345, 56\u201359. Krup\nski also observed that Costa Cruise\u2019s claims administrator\nhad responded to her claims notification without indicat\ning that Costa Cruise was not a responsible party. Id., at\n45. With her response, Krupski simultaneously moved to\namend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defen\ndant. Id., at 41\u201342, 52\u201354.\n   On July 2, 2008, after oral argument, the District Court\ndenied Costa Cruise\u2019s motion for summary judgment\nwithout prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend,\nordering that Krupski effect proper service on Costa Cro\nciere by September 16, 2008. Id., at 71\u201372. Complying\nwith the court\u2019s deadline, Krupski filed an amended com\nplaint on July 11, 2008, and served Costa Crociere on\nAugust 21, 2008. Id., at 73, 88\u201389. On that same date,\nthe District Court issued an order dismissing Costa Cruise\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the case pursuant to the parties\u2019 joint stipulation,\nKrupski apparently having concluded that Costa Cruise\nwas correct that it bore no responsibility for her injuries.\nId., at 85\u201386.\n  Shortly thereafter, Costa Crociere\u2014represented by the\nsame counsel who had represented Costa Cruise, compare\nid., at 31, with id., at 100\u2014moved to dismiss, contending\nthat the amended complaint did not relate back under\nRule 15(c) and was therefore untimely. The District Court\nagreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a\u201322a. Rule 15(c), the\ncourt explained, imposes three requirements before an\namended complaint against a newly named defendant can\nrelate back to the original complaint. First, the claim\nagainst the newly named defendant must have arisen \u201cout\nof the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out\u2014or\nattempted to be set out\u2014in the original pleading.\u201d Fed.\nRules Civ. Proc. 15(c)(1)(B), (C). Second, \u201cwithin the\nperiod provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and\ncomplaint\u201d (which is ordinarily 120 days from when the\ncomplaint is filed, see Rule 4(m)), the newly named defen\ndant must have \u201creceived such notice of the action that it\nwill not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u201d Rule\n15(c)(1)(C)(i). Finally, the plaintiff must show that, within\nthe Rule 4(m) period, the newly named defendant \u201cknew\nor should have known that the action would have been\nbrought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).\n  The first two conditions posed no problem, the court\nexplained: The claim against Costa Crociere clearly in\nvolved the same occurrence as the original claim against\nCosta Cruise, and Costa Crociere had constructive notice\nof the action and had not shown that any unfair prejudice\nwould result from relation back. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n14a\u201318a. But the court found the third condition fatal to\nKrupski\u2019s attempt to relate back, concluding that Krupski\nhad not made a mistake concerning the identity of the\n6             KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nproper party. Id., at 18a\u201321a. Relying on Eleventh Cir\ncuit precedent, the court explained that the word \u201cmis\ntake\u201d should not be construed to encompass a deliberate\ndecision not to sue a party whose identity the plaintiff\nknew before the statute of limitations had run. Because\nCosta Cruise informed Krupski that Costa Crociere was\nthe proper defendant in its answer, corporate disclosure\nstatement, and motion for summary judgment, and yet\nKrupski delayed for months in moving to amend and then\nin filing an amended complaint, the court concluded that\nKrupski knew of the proper defendant and made no\nmistake.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in an unpublished per\ncuriam opinion. Krupski v. Costa Cruise Lines, N. V.,\nLLC, 330 Fed. Appx. 892 (2009). Rather than relying on\nthe information contained in Costa Cruise\u2019s filings, all of\nwhich were made after the statute of limitations had\nexpired, as evidence that Krupski did not make a mistake,\nthe Court of Appeals noted that the relevant information\nwas located within Krupski\u2019s passenger ticket, which she\nhad furnished to her counsel well before the end of the\nlimitations period. Because the ticket clearly identified\nCosta Crociere as the carrier, the court stated, Krupski\neither knew or should have known of Costa Crociere\u2019s\nidentity as a potential party.1 It was therefore appropri\nate to treat Krupski as having chosen to sue one potential\nparty over another. Alternatively, even assuming that she\nfirst learned of Costa Crociere\u2019s identity as the correct\nparty from Costa Cruise\u2019s answer, the Court of Appeals\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court of Appeals stated that it was \u201cimput[ing]\u201d knowledge to\n\nKrupski. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. Petitioner uses the terms \u201cimputed\nknowledge\u201d and \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d interchangeably in her brief,\nwhile respondent addresses only actual knowledge. Because we reject\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 focus on the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge in the first\ninstance, see infra, at 8\u201313, the distinction among these types of\nknowledge is not relevant to our resolution of this case.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

We consider each reason\nin turn.\n                              A\n  The Court of Appeals first decided that Krupski either\nknew or should have known of the proper party\u2019s identity\nand thus determined that she had made a deliberate\nchoice instead of a mistake in not naming Costa Crociere\nas a party in her original pleading. 330 Fed. Appx., at\n895. By focusing on Krupski\u2019s knowledge, the Court of\nAppeals chose the wrong starting point. The question\nunder Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or\nshould have known the identity of Costa Crociere as the\nproper defendant, but whether Costa Crociere knew or\nshould have known that it would have been named as a\ndefendant but for an error. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) asks what\nthe prospective defendant knew or should have known\nduring the Rule 4(m) period, not what the plaintiff knew\nor should have known at the time of filing her original\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                       9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncomplaint.3\n   Information in the plaintiff\u2019s possession is relevant only\nif it bears on the defendant\u2019s understanding of whether\nthe plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party\u2019s\nidentity. For purposes of that inquiry, it would be error to\nconflate knowledge of a party\u2019s existence with the absence\nof mistake. A mistake is \u201c[a]n error, misconception, or\nmisunderstanding; an erroneous belief.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1092 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1446 (2002) (defining \u201cmis\ntake\u201d as \u201ca misunderstanding of the meaning or implica\ntion of something\u201d; \u201ca wrong action or statement proceed\ning from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or\ninattention\u201d; \u201can erroneous belief\u201d; or \u201ca state of mind not\nin accordance with the facts\u201d). That a plaintiff knows of a\nparty\u2019s existence does not preclude her from making a\nmistake with respect to that party\u2019s identity. A plaintiff\nmay know that a prospective defendant\u2014call him party\nA\u2014exists, while erroneously believing him to have the\nstatus of party B. Similarly, a plaintiff may know gener\nally what party A does while misunderstanding the roles\nthat party A and party B played in the \u201cconduct, transac\ntion, or occurrence\u201d giving rise to her claim. If the plaintiff\nsues party B instead of party A under these circum\nstances, she has made a \u201cmistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity\u201d notwithstanding her knowledge of the\nexistence of both parties. The only question under Rule\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Rule 15(c)(1)(C) speaks generally of an amendment to a \u201cpleading\u201d\n\nthat changes \u201cthe party against whom a claim is asserted,\u201d and it\ntherefore is not limited to the circumstance of a plaintiff filing an\namended complaint seeking to bring in a new defendant. Nevertheless,\nbecause the latter is the \u201ctypical case\u201d of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)\u2019s applicability,\nsee 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a715.19[2] (3d ed. 2009), we use this\ncircumstance as a shorthand throughout this opinion. See also id.,\n\u00a715.19[3][a]; Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes on Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 15, 28 U. S. C. App., pp. 122\u2013123 (hereinafter Advisory Commit\ntee\u2019s 1966 Notes).\n10           KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15(c)(1)(C)(ii), then, is whether party A knew or should\nhave known that, absent some mistake, the action would\nhave been brought against him.\n   Respondent urges that the key issue under Rule\n15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is whether the plaintiff made a deliberate\nchoice to sue one party over another. Brief for Respondent\n11\u201316. We agree that making a deliberate choice to sue\none party instead of another while fully understanding the\nfactual and legal differences between the two parties is the\nantithesis of making a mistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity. We disagree, however, with respondent\u2019s\nposition that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence\nof two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one, the\nproper defendant could reasonably believe that the plain\ntiff made no mistake. The reasonableness of the mistake\nis not itself at issue. As noted, a plaintiff might know that\nthe prospective defendant exists but nonetheless harbor a\nmisunderstanding about his status or role in the events\ngiving rise to the claim at issue, and she may mistakenly\nchoose to sue a different defendant based on that misim\npression. That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice does\nnot foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been\nsatisfied.\n   This reading is consistent with the purpose of relation\nback: to balance the interests of the defendant protected\nby the statute of limitations with the preference expressed\nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and\nRule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their mer\nits. See, e.g., Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122; 3\nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7\u00a715.02[1], 15.19[3][a] (3d ed.\n2009). A prospective defendant who legitimately believed\nthat the limitations period had passed without any at\ntempt to sue him has a strong interest in repose. But\nrepose would be a windfall for a prospective defendant\nwho understood, or who should have understood, that he\nescaped suit during the limitations period only because\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plaintiff misunderstood a crucial fact about his iden\ntity. Because a plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the existence of a\nparty does not foreclose the possibility that she has made\na mistake of identity about which that party should have\nbeen aware, such knowledge does not support that party\u2019s\ninterest in repose.\n   Our reading is also consistent with the history of Rule\n15(c)(1)(C). That provision was added in 1966 to respond\nto a recurring problem in suits against the Federal Gov\nernment, particularly in the Social Security context.\nAdvisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122. Individuals who\nhad filed timely lawsuits challenging the administrative\ndenial of benefits often failed to name the party identified\nin the statute as the proper defendant\u2014the current Secre\ntary of what was then the Department of Health, Educa\ntion, and Welfare\u2014and named instead the United States;\nthe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare itself;\nthe nonexistent \u201cFederal Security Administration\u201d; or a\nSecretary who had recently retired from office. Ibid. By\nthe time the plaintiffs discovered their mistakes, the\nstatute of limitations in many cases had expired, and the\ndistrict courts denied the plaintiffs leave to amend on the\nground that the amended complaints would not relate\nback. Rule 15(c) was therefore \u201camplified to provide a\ngeneral solution\u201d to this problem. Ibid. It is conceivable\nthat the Social Security litigants knew or reasonably\nshould have known the identity of the proper defendant\neither because of documents in their administrative cases\nor by dint of the statute setting forth the filing require\nments. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(g) (1958 ed., Supp. III).\nNonetheless, the Advisory Committee clearly meant their\nfilings to qualify as mistakes under the Rule.\n   Respondent suggests that our decision in Nelson v.\nAdams USA, Inc., 529 U. S. 460 (2000), forecloses the\nreading of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) we adopt today. We dis\nagree. In that case, Adams USA, Inc. (Adams), had ob\n12             KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntained an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the corporation\nof which Donald Nelson was the president and sole share\nholder. After Adams became concerned that the corpora\ntion did not have sufficient funds to pay the award, Adams\nsought to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party and\nsimultaneously moved to amend the judgment to hold\nNelson responsible. The District Court granted both\nmotions, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed,\nholding that the requirements of due process, as codified\nin Rules 12 and 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\ndemand that an added party have the opportunity to\nrespond before judgment is entered against him. Id., at\n465\u2013467. In a footnote explaining that relation back does\nnot deny the added party an opportunity to respond to the\namended pleading, we noted that the case did not arise\nunder the \u201cmistake clause\u201d of Rule 15(c):4 \u201cRespondent\nAdams made no such mistake. It knew of Nelson\u2019s role\nand existence and, until it moved to amend its pleading,\nchose to assert its claim for costs and fees only against\n[Nelson\u2019s company].\u201d Id., at 467, n. 1.\n   Contrary to respondent\u2019s claim, Nelson does not suggest\nthat Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) cannot be satisfied if a plaintiff\nknew of the prospective defendant\u2019s existence at the time\nshe filed her original complaint. In that case, there was\nnothing in the initial pleading suggesting that Nelson was\nan intended party, while there was evidence in the record\n(of which Nelson was aware) that Adams sought to add\nhim only after learning that the company would not be\nable to satisfy the judgment. Id., at 463\u2013464. This evi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The \u201cmistake clause\u201d at the time we decided Nelson was set forth in\n\nRule 15(c)(3). 529 U. S., at 467, n. 1; 528 F. R. D. 525, 529 (1991). Rule\n15(c) was renumbered in 2007 without substantive change \u201cas part of\nthe general restyling of the Civil Rules,\u201d at which time it received its\ncurrent placement in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).

S. ____ (2010)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndence countered any implication that Adams had origi\nnally failed to name Nelson because of any \u201cmistake con\ncerning the proper party\u2019s identity,\u201d and instead suggested\nthat Adams decided to name Nelson only after the fact in\nan attempt to ensure that the fee award would be paid.\nThe footnote merely observes that Adams had originally\nbeen under no misimpression about the function Nelson\nplayed in the underlying dispute. We said, after all, that\nAdams knew of Nelson\u2019s \u201crole\u201d as well as his existence.\nId., at 467, n. 1. Read in context, the footnote in Nelson is\nentirely consistent with our understanding of the Rule:\nWhen the original complaint and the plaintiff\u2019s conduct\ncompel the conclusion that the failure to name the pro\nspective defendant in the original complaint was the result\nof a fully informed decision as opposed to a mistake con\ncerning the proper defendant\u2019s identity, the requirements\nof Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are not met. This conclusion is in\nkeeping with our rejection today of the Court of Appeals\u2019\nreliance on the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge to deny relation back.\n                               B\n  The Court of Appeals offered a second reason why Krup\nski\u2019s amended complaint did not relate back: Krupski had\nunduly delayed in seeking to file, and in eventually filing,\nan amended complaint. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. The\nCourt of Appeals offered no support for its view that a\nplaintiff\u2019s dilatory conduct can justify the denial of relation\nback under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), and we find none. The Rule\nplainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for\nrelation back, and the amending party\u2019s diligence is not\namong them. Moreover, the Rule mandates relation back\nonce the Rule\u2019s requirements are satisfied; it does not\nleave the decision whether to grant relation back to the\ndistrict court\u2019s equitable discretion. See Rule 15(c)(1) (\u201cAn\namendment . . . relates back . . . when\u201d the three listed\nrequirements are met (emphasis added)).\n14          KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The mandatory nature of the inquiry for relation back\nunder Rule 15(c) is particularly striking in contrast to the\ninquiry under Rule 15(a), which sets forth the circum\nstances in which a party may amend its pleading before\ntrial. By its terms, Rule 15(a) gives discretion to the\ndistrict court in deciding whether to grant a motion to\namend a pleading to add a party or a claim. Following an\ninitial period after filing a pleading during which a party\nmay amend once \u201cas a matter of course,\u201d \u201ca party may\namend its pleading only with the opposing party\u2019s written\nconsent or the court\u2019s leave,\u201d which the court \u201cshould\nfreely give . . . when justice so requires.\u201d Rules 15(a)(1)\u2013\n(2). We have previously explained that a court may con\nsider a movant\u2019s \u201cundue delay\u201d or \u201cdilatory motive\u201d in\ndeciding whether to grant leave to amend under Rule\n15(a). Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182 (1962). As the\ncontrast between Rule 15(a) and Rule 15(c) makes clear,\nhowever, the speed with which a plaintiff moves to amend\nher complaint or files an amended complaint after obtain\ning leave to do so has no bearing on whether the amended\ncomplaint relates back. Cf. 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71498, pp. 142\u2013143,\nand nn. 49\u201350 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2010).\n   Rule 15(c)(1)(C) does permit a court to examine a plain\ntiff\u2019s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but not in the\nway or for the purpose respondent or the Court of Appeals\nsuggests. As we have explained, the question under Rule\n15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is what the prospective defendant reasona\nbly should have understood about the plaintiff\u2019s intent in\nfiling the original complaint against the first defendant.\nTo the extent the plaintiff\u2019s postfiling conduct informs the\nprospective defendant\u2019s understanding of whether the\nplaintiff initially made a \u201cmistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity,\u201d a court may consider the conduct. Cf.\nLeonard v. Parry, 219 F. 3d 25, 29 (CA1 2000) (\u201c[P]ost\nfiling events occasionally can shed light on the plaintiff\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

The plaintiff\u2019s postfiling\nconduct is otherwise immaterial to the question whether\nan amended complaint relates back.5\n                             C\n   Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we\nthink it clear that the courts below erred in denying rela\ntion back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The District Court\nheld that Costa Crociere had \u201cconstructive notice\u201d of\nKrupski\u2019s complaint within the Rule 4(m) period. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 15a\u201317a. Costa Crociere has not challenged\nthis finding. Because the complaint made clear that Krup\nski meant to sue the company that \u201cowned, operated,\nmanaged, supervised and controlled\u201d the ship on which\nshe was injured, App. 23, and also indicated (mistakenly)\nthat Costa Cruise performed those roles, id., at 23\u201327,\nCosta Crociere should have known, within the Rule 4(m)\nperiod, that it was not named as a defendant in that com\nplaint only because of Krupski\u2019s misunderstanding about\nwhich \u201cCosta\u201d entity was in charge of the ship\u2014clearly a\n\u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d\n   Respondent contends that because the original com\nplaint referred to the ticket\u2019s forum requirement and\npresuit claims notification procedure, Krupski was clearly\naware of the contents of the ticket, and because the ticket\nidentified Costa Crociere as the carrier and proper party\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Similarly,we reject respondent\u2019s suggestion that Rule 15(c) requires\na plaintiff to move to amend her complaint or to file and serve an\namended complaint within the Rule 4(m) period. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i)\nsimply requires that the prospective defendant has received sufficient\n\u201cnotice of the action\u201d within the Rule 4(m) period that he will not be\nprejudiced in defending the case on the merits. The Advisory Commit\ntee Notes to the 1966 Amendment clarify that \u201cthe notice need not be\nformal.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122.\n16             KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfor a lawsuit, respondent was entitled to think that she\nmade a deliberate choice to sue Costa Cruise instead of\nCosta Crociere. Brief for Respondent 13. As we have\nexplained, however, that Krupski may have known the\ncontents of the ticket does not foreclose the possibility that\nshe nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the\ntwo companies\u2019 identities. Especially because the face of\nthe complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding,\nrespondent\u2019s contention is not persuasive. Moreover,\nrespondent has articulated no strategy that it could rea\nsonably have thought Krupski was pursuing in suing a\ndefendant that was legally unable to provide relief.\n  Respondent also argues that Krupski\u2019s failure to move\nto amend her complaint during the Rule 4(m) period\nshows that she made no mistake in that period. Id., at\n13\u201314. But as discussed, any delay on Krupski\u2019s part is\nrelevant only to the extent it may have informed Costa\nCrociere\u2019s understanding during the Rule 4(m) period of\nwhether she made a mistake originally. Krupski\u2019s failure\nto add Costa Crociere during the Rule 4(m) period is not\nsufficient to make reasonable any belief that she had\nmade a deliberate and informed decision not to sue Costa\nCrociere in the first instance.6 Nothing in Krupski\u2019s con\nduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that she failed\nto name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a\nmistake.\n  It is also worth noting that Costa Cruise and Costa\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court of Appeals concluded that Krupski was not diligent\n\nmerely because she did not seek leave to add Costa Crociere until 133\ndays after she filed her original complaint and did not actually file an\namended complaint for another a month after that. 330 Fed. Appx., at\n895. It is not clear why Krupski should have been found dilatory for\nnot accepting at face value the unproven allegations in Costa Cruise\u2019s\nanswer and corporate disclosure form. In fact, Krupski moved to\namend her complaint to add Costa Crociere within the time period\nprescribed by the District Court\u2019s scheduling order.

Cassell\u2019s\nItalian Dictionary 137, 670 (1967). This interrelationship\nand similarity heighten the expectation that Costa Croci\nere should suspect a mistake has been made when Costa\nCruise is named in a complaint that actually describes\nCosta Crociere\u2019s activities. Cf. Morel v. DaimlerChrysler\nAG, 565 F. 3d 20, 27 (CA1 2009) (where complaint con\nveyed plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to sue automobile manufacturer\nand erroneously named the manufacturer as Daimler-\nChrysler Corporation instead of the actual manufacturer,\na legally distinct but related entity named DaimlerChrys\nler AG, the latter should have realized it had not been\nnamed because of plaintiffs\u2019 mistake); Goodman v. Prax\nair, Inc., 494 F. 3d 458, 473\u2013475 (CA4 2007) (en banc)\n(where complaint named parent company Praxair, Inc.,\nbut described status of subsidiary company Praxair Ser\nvices, Inc., subsidiary company knew or should have\nknown it had not been named because of plaintiff\u2019s mis\ntake). In addition, Costa Crociere\u2019s own actions contrib\nuted to passenger confusion over \u201cthe proper party\u201d for a\nlawsuit. The front of the ticket advertises that \u201cCosta\nCruises\u201d has achieved a certification of quality, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 25a, without clarifying whether \u201cCosta\nCruises\u201d is Costa Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, or some\nother related \u201cCosta\u201d company. Indeed, Costa Crociere is\nevidently aware that the difference between Costa Cruise\nand Costa Crociere can be confusing for cruise ship pas\nsengers. See, e.g., Suppa v. Costa Crociere, S. p.

A.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u2013337.      Argued April 21, 2010\u2014Decided June 7, 2010\nPetitioner Krupski sought compensation for injuries she suffered on a\n  cruise ship. Her passenger ticket, which was issued by Costa Cruise\n  Lines, identified respondent Costa Crociere S. p. A. as the carrier; re\n  quired an injured party to submit to the carrier or its agent written\n  notice of a claim; required any lawsuit to be filed within one year of\n  the injury; and designated a specific Federal District Court as the ex\n  clusive forum for lawsuits such as Krupski\u2019s. The front of the ticket\n  listed Costa Cruise\u2019s Florida address and made references to \u201cCosta\n  Cruises.\u201d After Krupski\u2019s attorney notified Costa Cruise of her\n  claims but did not reach a settlement, Krupski filed a diversity negli\n  gence action against Costa Cruise. Over the next several months\u2014\n  after the limitations period had expired\u2014Costa Cruise brought Costa\n  Crociere\u2019s existence to Krupski\u2019s attention three times, including in\n  its motion for summary judgment, in which it stated that Costa Cro\n  ciere was the proper defendant. Krupski responded and moved to\n  amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defendant. The Dis\n  trict Court denied Costa Cruise\u2019s summary judgment motion without\n  prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend. After she served\n  Costa Crociere with an amended complaint, the court dismissed\n  Costa Cruise from the case. Thereafter, Costa Crociere\u2014represented\n  by the same counsel as Costa Cruise\u2014moved to dismiss, contending\n  that the amended complaint did not satisfy the requirements of Fed\n  eral Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), which governs when an amended\n  pleading \u201crelates back\u201d to the date of a timely filed original pleading\n  and is thus timely even though it was filed outside an applicable limi\n  tations period. The Rule requires, inter alia, that within the Rule\n  4(m) 120-day period for service after a complaint is filed, the newly\n  named defendant \u201cknew or should have known that the action would\n2                KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper\n    party\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The District Court found this\n    condition fatal to Krupski\u2019s attempt to relate back. It concluded that\n    she had not made a mistake about the proper party\u2019s identity be\n    cause, although Costa Cruise had disclosed Costa Crociere\u2019s role in\n    several court filings, she nonetheless delayed for months filing an\n    amended complaint. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, finding that\n    Krupski either knew or should have known of Costa Crociere\u2019s iden\n    tity as a potential party because she furnished the ticket identifying\n    it to her counsel well before the limitations period ended. It was\n    therefore appropriate to treat her as having chosen to sue one poten\n    tial party over another. Additionally, the court held that relation\n    back was not appropriate because of Krupski\u2019s undue delay in seek\n    ing to amend the complaint.\nHeld: Relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party\n to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending party\u2019s\n knowledge or timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading. Pp. 7\u201318.\n    (a) The Rule\u2019s text does not support the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision\n to rely on the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge in denying relation back. The\n question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or\n should have known Costa Crociere\u2019s identity as the proper defendant,\n but whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known during the\n Rule 4(m) period that it would have been named as the defendant but\n for an error. The plaintiff\u2019s information is relevant only if it bears on\n the defendant\u2019s understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mis\n take regarding the proper party\u2019s identity. It would be error to con\n flate knowledge of a party\u2019s existence with the absence of mistake.\n That a plaintiff knows of a party\u2019s existence does not preclude her\n from making a mistake with respect to that party\u2019s identity. Making\n a deliberate choice to sue one party over another while understand\n ing the factual and legal differences between the two parties may be\n the antithesis of making a mistake, but that does not mean that any\n time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to\n sue the wrong one, the proper defendant could reasonably believe\n that the plaintiff made no mistake. A plaintiff might know that the\n prospective defendant exists but nonetheless choose to sue a different\n defendant based on a misunderstanding about the proper party\u2019s\n identity. That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice should not fore\n close a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied. This read\n ing is consistent with relation back\u2019s purpose of balancing the defen\n dant\u2019s interests protected by the statute of limitations with the\n preference of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and\n Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their merits. It is also\n consistent with the history of Rule 15(c)(1)(C). And it is not fore\n                   Cite as: 560 U.

Pp. 7\u201313.\n   (b) The Eleventh Circuit also erred in ruling that Krupski\u2019s undue\ndelay in seeking to file, and in eventually filing, an amended com\nplaint justified its denial of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C). The\nRule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation\nback, and the plaintiff\u2019s diligence is not among them. Moreover, it\nmandates relation back once its requirements are satisfied; it does\nnot leave that decision to the district court\u2019s equitable discretion. Its\nmandatory nature is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry\nunder Rule 15(a), which gives a district court discretion to decide\nwhether to grant a motion to amend a pleading before trial. See\nFoman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182. Rule 15(c)(1)(C) permits a court\nto examine a plaintiff\u2019s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but only\nto the extent the plaintiff\u2019s postfiling conduct informs the prospective\ndefendant\u2019s understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a\n\u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s post\nfiling conduct is otherwise immaterial to the relation-back question.\nPp. 13\u201315.\n   (c) Under these principles, the courts below erred in denying rela\ntion back. Because the original complaint (of which Costa Crociere\nhad constructive notice) made clear that Krupski meant to sue the\ncompany that \u201cowned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled\u201d\nthe ship on which she was injured and also indicated (mistakenly)\nthat Costa Cruise performed those roles, Costa Crociere should have\nknown that it avoided suit within the limitations period only because\nof Krupski\u2019s misunderstanding about which \u201cCosta\u201d entity was in\ncharge of the ship\u2014clearly a \u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s\nidentity.\u201d That Krupski may have known the ticket\u2019s contents does\nnot foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood cru\ncial facts regarding the two companies\u2019 identities. Especially because\nthe face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding,\nrespondent\u2019s contention that it was entitled to think she made no\nmistake is not persuasive. Moreover, respondent has articulated no\nstrategy that it could reasonably have thought Krupski was pursuing\nin suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief. Noth\ning in Krupski\u2019s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that\nshe failed to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a\nmistake. The interrelationship between Costa Cruise and Costa Cro\nciere and their similar names heighten the expectation that Costa\nCrociere should suspect a mistake when Costa Cruise is named in a\ncomplaint actually describing Costa Crociere\u2019s activities. In addition,\nCosta Crociere\u2019s own actions contributed to passenger confusion over\n\u201cthe proper party\u201d: The front of the ticket advertises that \u201cCosta\nCruises\u201d has achieved a certification of quality without clarifying\n4                KRUPSKI v.

The complaint\nalleged that Costa Cruise \u201cowned, operated, managed,\nsupervised and controlled\u201d the ship on which Krupski had\ninjured herself; that Costa Cruise had extended to its\npassengers an invitation to enter onto the ship; and that\nCosta Cruise owed Krupski a duty of care, which it\nbreached by failing to take steps that would have pre\nvented her accident.

Krupski served\nCosta Cruise on February 4, 2008.\n   Over the next several months\u2014after the limitations\nperiod had expired\u2014Costa Cruise brought Costa Croci\nere\u2019s existence to Krupski\u2019s attention three times.

According to Krupski, the following sources of\ninformation led her to believe Costa Cruise was the re\nsponsible party: The travel documents prominently identi\nfied Costa Cruise and gave its Florida address; Costa\nCruise\u2019s Web site listed Costa Cruise in Florida as the\nUnited States office for the Italian company Costa Croci\nere; and the Web site of the Florida Department of State\nlisted Costa Cruise as the only \u201cCosta\u201d company registered\nto do business in that State.

Krup\nski also observed that Costa Cruise\u2019s claims administrator\nhad responded to her claims notification without indicat\ning that Costa Cruise was not a responsible party. Id., at\n45.

S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the case pursuant to the parties\u2019 joint stipulation,\nKrupski apparently having concluded that Costa Cruise\nwas correct that it bore no responsibility for her injuries.\nId., at 85\u201386.\n  Shortly thereafter, Costa Crociere\u2014represented by the\nsame counsel who had represented Costa Cruise, compare\nid., at 31, with id., at 100\u2014moved to dismiss, contending\nthat the amended complaint did not relate back under\nRule 15(c) and was therefore untimely. The District Court\nagreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a\u201322a. Rule 15(c), the\ncourt explained, imposes three requirements before an\namended complaint against a newly named defendant can\nrelate back to the original complaint. First, the claim\nagainst the newly named defendant must have arisen \u201cout\nof the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out\u2014or\nattempted to be set out\u2014in the original pleading.\u201d Fed.\nRules Civ. Proc. 15(c)(1)(B), (C). Second, \u201cwithin the\nperiod provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and\ncomplaint\u201d (which is ordinarily 120 days from when the\ncomplaint is filed, see Rule 4(m)), the newly named defen\ndant must have \u201creceived such notice of the action that it\nwill not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u201d Rule\n15(c)(1)(C)(i). Finally, the plaintiff must show that, within\nthe Rule 4(m) period, the newly named defendant \u201cknew\nor should have known that the action would have been\nbrought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).\n  The first two conditions posed no problem, the court\nexplained: The claim against Costa Crociere clearly in\nvolved the same occurrence as the original claim against\nCosta Cruise, and Costa Crociere had constructive notice\nof the action and had not shown that any unfair prejudice\nwould result from relation back. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n14a\u201318a. But the court found the third condition fatal to\nKrupski\u2019s attempt to relate back, concluding that Krupski\nhad not made a mistake concerning the identity of the\n6             KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nproper party. Id., at 18a\u201321a. Relying on Eleventh Cir\ncuit precedent, the court explained that the word \u201cmis\ntake\u201d should not be construed to encompass a deliberate\ndecision not to sue a party whose identity the plaintiff\nknew before the statute of limitations had run. Because\nCosta Cruise informed Krupski that Costa Crociere was\nthe proper defendant in its answer, corporate disclosure\nstatement, and motion for summary judgment, and yet\nKrupski delayed for months in moving to amend and then\nin filing an amended complaint, the court concluded that\nKrupski knew of the proper defendant and made no\nmistake.\n   The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in an unpublished per\ncuriam opinion. Krupski v. Costa Cruise Lines, N. V.,\nLLC, 330 Fed. Appx. 892 (2009). Rather than relying on\nthe information contained in Costa Cruise\u2019s filings, all of\nwhich were made after the statute of limitations had\nexpired, as evidence that Krupski did not make a mistake,\nthe Court of Appeals noted that the relevant information\nwas located within Krupski\u2019s passenger ticket, which she\nhad furnished to her counsel well before the end of the\nlimitations period. Because the ticket clearly identified\nCosta Crociere as the carrier, the court stated, Krupski\neither knew or should have known of Costa Crociere\u2019s\nidentity as a potential party.1 It was therefore appropri\nate to treat Krupski as having chosen to sue one potential\nparty over another. Alternatively, even assuming that she\nfirst learned of Costa Crociere\u2019s identity as the correct\nparty from Costa Cruise\u2019s answer, the Court of Appeals\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court of Appeals stated that it was \u201cimput[ing]\u201d knowledge to\n\nKrupski. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. Petitioner uses the terms \u201cimputed\nknowledge\u201d and \u201cconstructive knowledge\u201d interchangeably in her brief,\nwhile respondent addresses only actual knowledge. Because we reject\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 focus on the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge in the first\ninstance, see infra, at 8\u201313, the distinction among these types of\nknowledge is not relevant to our resolution of this case.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

In light of this delay, the Court of Appeals concluded\nthat the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying relation back.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve tension among the\nCircuits over the breadth of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii),2 558 U.

We consider each reason\nin turn.\n                              A\n  The Court of Appeals first decided that Krupski either\nknew or should have known of the proper party\u2019s identity\nand thus determined that she had made a deliberate\nchoice instead of a mistake in not naming Costa Crociere\nas a party in her original pleading. 330 Fed. Appx., at\n895. By focusing on Krupski\u2019s knowledge, the Court of\nAppeals chose the wrong starting point. The question\nunder Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or\nshould have known the identity of Costa Crociere as the\nproper defendant, but whether Costa Crociere knew or\nshould have known that it would have been named as a\ndefendant but for an error. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) asks what\nthe prospective defendant knew or should have known\nduring the Rule 4(m) period, not what the plaintiff knew\nor should have known at the time of filing her original\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                       9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ncomplaint.3\n   Information in the plaintiff\u2019s possession is relevant only\nif it bears on the defendant\u2019s understanding of whether\nthe plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party\u2019s\nidentity. For purposes of that inquiry, it would be error to\nconflate knowledge of a party\u2019s existence with the absence\nof mistake. A mistake is \u201c[a]n error, misconception, or\nmisunderstanding; an erroneous belief.\u201d Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 1092 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster\u2019s Third\nNew International Dictionary 1446 (2002) (defining \u201cmis\ntake\u201d as \u201ca misunderstanding of the meaning or implica\ntion of something\u201d; \u201ca wrong action or statement proceed\ning from faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or\ninattention\u201d; \u201can erroneous belief\u201d; or \u201ca state of mind not\nin accordance with the facts\u201d). That a plaintiff knows of a\nparty\u2019s existence does not preclude her from making a\nmistake with respect to that party\u2019s identity. A plaintiff\nmay know that a prospective defendant\u2014call him party\nA\u2014exists, while erroneously believing him to have the\nstatus of party B. Similarly, a plaintiff may know gener\nally what party A does while misunderstanding the roles\nthat party A and party B played in the \u201cconduct, transac\ntion, or occurrence\u201d giving rise to her claim. If the plaintiff\nsues party B instead of party A under these circum\nstances, she has made a \u201cmistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity\u201d notwithstanding her knowledge of the\nexistence of both parties. The only question under Rule\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Rule 15(c)(1)(C) speaks generally of an amendment to a \u201cpleading\u201d\n\nthat changes \u201cthe party against whom a claim is asserted,\u201d and it\ntherefore is not limited to the circumstance of a plaintiff filing an\namended complaint seeking to bring in a new defendant. Nevertheless,\nbecause the latter is the \u201ctypical case\u201d of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)\u2019s applicability,\nsee 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a715.19[2] (3d ed. 2009), we use this\ncircumstance as a shorthand throughout this opinion. See also id.,\n\u00a715.19[3][a]; Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes on Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 15, 28 U. S. C. App., pp. 122\u2013123 (hereinafter Advisory Commit\ntee\u2019s 1966 Notes).\n10           KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15(c)(1)(C)(ii), then, is whether party A knew or should\nhave known that, absent some mistake, the action would\nhave been brought against him.\n   Respondent urges that the key issue under Rule\n15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is whether the plaintiff made a deliberate\nchoice to sue one party over another. Brief for Respondent\n11\u201316. We agree that making a deliberate choice to sue\none party instead of another while fully understanding the\nfactual and legal differences between the two parties is the\nantithesis of making a mistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity. We disagree, however, with respondent\u2019s\nposition that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence\nof two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one, the\nproper defendant could reasonably believe that the plain\ntiff made no mistake. The reasonableness of the mistake\nis not itself at issue. As noted, a plaintiff might know that\nthe prospective defendant exists but nonetheless harbor a\nmisunderstanding about his status or role in the events\ngiving rise to the claim at issue, and she may mistakenly\nchoose to sue a different defendant based on that misim\npression. That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice does\nnot foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been\nsatisfied.\n   This reading is consistent with the purpose of relation\nback: to balance the interests of the defendant protected\nby the statute of limitations with the preference expressed\nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and\nRule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their mer\nits. See, e.g., Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122; 3\nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7\u00a715.02[1], 15.19[3][a] (3d ed.\n2009). A prospective defendant who legitimately believed\nthat the limitations period had passed without any at\ntempt to sue him has a strong interest in repose. But\nrepose would be a windfall for a prospective defendant\nwho understood, or who should have understood, that he\nescaped suit during the limitations period only because\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe plaintiff misunderstood a crucial fact about his iden\ntity. Because a plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the existence of a\nparty does not foreclose the possibility that she has made\na mistake of identity about which that party should have\nbeen aware, such knowledge does not support that party\u2019s\ninterest in repose.\n   Our reading is also consistent with the history of Rule\n15(c)(1)(C). That provision was added in 1966 to respond\nto a recurring problem in suits against the Federal Gov\nernment, particularly in the Social Security context.\nAdvisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122. Individuals who\nhad filed timely lawsuits challenging the administrative\ndenial of benefits often failed to name the party identified\nin the statute as the proper defendant\u2014the current Secre\ntary of what was then the Department of Health, Educa\ntion, and Welfare\u2014and named instead the United States;\nthe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare itself;\nthe nonexistent \u201cFederal Security Administration\u201d; or a\nSecretary who had recently retired from office. Ibid. By\nthe time the plaintiffs discovered their mistakes, the\nstatute of limitations in many cases had expired, and the\ndistrict courts denied the plaintiffs leave to amend on the\nground that the amended complaints would not relate\nback. Rule 15(c) was therefore \u201camplified to provide a\ngeneral solution\u201d to this problem. Ibid. It is conceivable\nthat the Social Security litigants knew or reasonably\nshould have known the identity of the proper defendant\neither because of documents in their administrative cases\nor by dint of the statute setting forth the filing require\nments. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7405(g) (1958 ed., Supp. III).\nNonetheless, the Advisory Committee clearly meant their\nfilings to qualify as mistakes under the Rule.\n   Respondent suggests that our decision in Nelson v.\nAdams USA, Inc., 529 U. S. 460 (2000), forecloses the\nreading of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) we adopt today. We dis\nagree. In that case, Adams USA, Inc. (Adams), had ob\n12             KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntained an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the corporation\nof which Donald Nelson was the president and sole share\nholder. After Adams became concerned that the corpora\ntion did not have sufficient funds to pay the award, Adams\nsought to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party and\nsimultaneously moved to amend the judgment to hold\nNelson responsible. The District Court granted both\nmotions, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed,\nholding that the requirements of due process, as codified\nin Rules 12 and 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\ndemand that an added party have the opportunity to\nrespond before judgment is entered against him. Id., at\n465\u2013467. In a footnote explaining that relation back does\nnot deny the added party an opportunity to respond to the\namended pleading, we noted that the case did not arise\nunder the \u201cmistake clause\u201d of Rule 15(c):4 \u201cRespondent\nAdams made no such mistake. It knew of Nelson\u2019s role\nand existence and, until it moved to amend its pleading,\nchose to assert its claim for costs and fees only against\n[Nelson\u2019s company].\u201d Id., at 467, n. 1.\n   Contrary to respondent\u2019s claim, Nelson does not suggest\nthat Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) cannot be satisfied if a plaintiff\nknew of the prospective defendant\u2019s existence at the time\nshe filed her original complaint. In that case, there was\nnothing in the initial pleading suggesting that Nelson was\nan intended party, while there was evidence in the record\n(of which Nelson was aware) that Adams sought to add\nhim only after learning that the company would not be\nable to satisfy the judgment. Id., at 463\u2013464. This evi\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The \u201cmistake clause\u201d at the time we decided Nelson was set forth in\n\nRule 15(c)(3). 529 U.

Rule\n15(c) was renumbered in 2007 without substantive change \u201cas part of\nthe general restyling of the Civil Rules,\u201d at which time it received its\ncurrent placement in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).

We said, after all, that\nAdams knew of Nelson\u2019s \u201crole\u201d as well as his existence.\nId., at 467, n. 1. Read in context, the footnote in Nelson is\nentirely consistent with our understanding of the Rule:\nWhen the original complaint and the plaintiff\u2019s conduct\ncompel the conclusion that the failure to name the pro\nspective defendant in the original complaint was the result\nof a fully informed decision as opposed to a mistake con\ncerning the proper defendant\u2019s identity, the requirements\nof Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are not met. This conclusion is in\nkeeping with our rejection today of the Court of Appeals\u2019\nreliance on the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge to deny relation back.\n                               B\n  The Court of Appeals offered a second reason why Krup\nski\u2019s amended complaint did not relate back: Krupski had\nunduly delayed in seeking to file, and in eventually filing,\nan amended complaint. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. The\nCourt of Appeals offered no support for its view that a\nplaintiff\u2019s dilatory conduct can justify the denial of relation\nback under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), and we find none. The Rule\nplainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for\nrelation back, and the amending party\u2019s diligence is not\namong them. Moreover, the Rule mandates relation back\nonce the Rule\u2019s requirements are satisfied; it does not\nleave the decision whether to grant relation back to the\ndistrict court\u2019s equitable discretion. See Rule 15(c)(1) (\u201cAn\namendment . . . relates back . . . when\u201d the three listed\nrequirements are met (emphasis added)).\n14          KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The mandatory nature of the inquiry for relation back\nunder Rule 15(c) is particularly striking in contrast to the\ninquiry under Rule 15(a), which sets forth the circum\nstances in which a party may amend its pleading before\ntrial. By its terms, Rule 15(a) gives discretion to the\ndistrict court in deciding whether to grant a motion to\namend a pleading to add a party or a claim. Following an\ninitial period after filing a pleading during which a party\nmay amend once \u201cas a matter of course,\u201d \u201ca party may\namend its pleading only with the opposing party\u2019s written\nconsent or the court\u2019s leave,\u201d which the court \u201cshould\nfreely give . . . when justice so requires.\u201d Rules 15(a)(1)\u2013\n(2). We have previously explained that a court may con\nsider a movant\u2019s \u201cundue delay\u201d or \u201cdilatory motive\u201d in\ndeciding whether to grant leave to amend under Rule\n15(a). Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178, 182 (1962). As the\ncontrast between Rule 15(a) and Rule 15(c) makes clear,\nhowever, the speed with which a plaintiff moves to amend\nher complaint or files an amended complaint after obtain\ning leave to do so has no bearing on whether the amended\ncomplaint relates back. Cf. 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71498, pp. 142\u2013143,\nand nn. 49\u201350 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2010).\n   Rule 15(c)(1)(C) does permit a court to examine a plain\ntiff\u2019s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but not in the\nway or for the purpose respondent or the Court of Appeals\nsuggests. As we have explained, the question under Rule\n15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is what the prospective defendant reasona\nbly should have understood about the plaintiff\u2019s intent in\nfiling the original complaint against the first defendant.\nTo the extent the plaintiff\u2019s postfiling conduct informs the\nprospective defendant\u2019s understanding of whether the\nplaintiff initially made a \u201cmistake concerning the proper\nparty\u2019s identity,\u201d a court may consider the conduct. Cf.\nLeonard v. Parry, 219 F. 3d 25, 29 (CA1 2000) (\u201c[P]ost\nfiling events occasionally can shed light on the plaintiff\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

The plaintiff\u2019s postfiling\nconduct is otherwise immaterial to the question whether\nan amended complaint relates back.5\n                             C\n   Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we\nthink it clear that the courts below erred in denying rela\ntion back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The District Court\nheld that Costa Crociere had \u201cconstructive notice\u201d of\nKrupski\u2019s complaint within the Rule 4(m) period. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 15a\u201317a. Costa Crociere has not challenged\nthis finding. Because the complaint made clear that Krup\nski meant to sue the company that \u201cowned, operated,\nmanaged, supervised and controlled\u201d the ship on which\nshe was injured, App. 23, and also indicated (mistakenly)\nthat Costa Cruise performed those roles, id., at 23\u201327,\nCosta Crociere should have known, within the Rule 4(m)\nperiod, that it was not named as a defendant in that com\nplaint only because of Krupski\u2019s misunderstanding about\nwhich \u201cCosta\u201d entity was in charge of the ship\u2014clearly a\n\u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d\n   Respondent contends that because the original com\nplaint referred to the ticket\u2019s forum requirement and\npresuit claims notification procedure, Krupski was clearly\naware of the contents of the ticket, and because the ticket\nidentified Costa Crociere as the carrier and proper party\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Similarly,we reject respondent\u2019s suggestion that Rule 15(c) requires\na plaintiff to move to amend her complaint or to file and serve an\namended complaint within the Rule 4(m) period. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i)\nsimply requires that the prospective defendant has received sufficient\n\u201cnotice of the action\u201d within the Rule 4(m) period that he will not be\nprejudiced in defending the case on the merits. The Advisory Commit\ntee Notes to the 1966 Amendment clarify that \u201cthe notice need not be\nformal.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122.\n16             KRUPSKI v. COSTA CROCIERE S. P. A.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfor a lawsuit, respondent was entitled to think that she\nmade a deliberate choice to sue Costa Cruise instead of\nCosta Crociere. Brief for Respondent 13. As we have\nexplained, however, that Krupski may have known the\ncontents of the ticket does not foreclose the possibility that\nshe nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the\ntwo companies\u2019 identities. Especially because the face of\nthe complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding,\nrespondent\u2019s contention is not persuasive. Moreover,\nrespondent has articulated no strategy that it could rea\nsonably have thought Krupski was pursuing in suing a\ndefendant that was legally unable to provide relief.\n  Respondent also argues that Krupski\u2019s failure to move\nto amend her complaint during the Rule 4(m) period\nshows that she made no mistake in that period. Id., at\n13\u201314. But as discussed, any delay on Krupski\u2019s part is\nrelevant only to the extent it may have informed Costa\nCrociere\u2019s understanding during the Rule 4(m) period of\nwhether she made a mistake originally. Krupski\u2019s failure\nto add Costa Crociere during the Rule 4(m) period is not\nsufficient to make reasonable any belief that she had\nmade a deliberate and informed decision not to sue Costa\nCrociere in the first instance.6 Nothing in Krupski\u2019s con\nduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that she failed\nto name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a\nmistake.\n  It is also worth noting that Costa Cruise and Costa\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court of Appeals concluded that Krupski was not diligent\n\nmerely because she did not seek leave to add Costa Crociere until 133\ndays after she filed her original complaint and did not actually file an\namended complaint for another a month after that. 330 Fed. Appx., at\n895. It is not clear why Krupski should have been found dilatory for\nnot accepting at face value the unproven allegations in Costa Cruise\u2019s\nanswer and corporate disclosure form. In fact, Krupski moved to\namend her complaint to add Costa Crociere within the time period\nprescribed by the District Court\u2019s scheduling order.

S. ____ (2010)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCrociere are related corporate entities with very similar\nnames; \u201ccrociera\u201d even means \u201ccruise\u201d in Italian. Cassell\u2019s\nItalian Dictionary 137, 670 (1967). This interrelationship\nand similarity heighten the expectation that Costa Croci\nere should suspect a mistake has been made when Costa\nCruise is named in a complaint that actually describes\nCosta Crociere\u2019s activities. Cf. Morel v. DaimlerChrysler\nAG, 565 F. 3d 20, 27 (CA1 2009) (where complaint con\nveyed plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to sue automobile manufacturer\nand erroneously named the manufacturer as Daimler-\nChrysler Corporation instead of the actual manufacturer,\na legally distinct but related entity named DaimlerChrys\nler AG, the latter should have realized it had not been\nnamed because of plaintiffs\u2019 mistake); Goodman v. Prax\nair, Inc., 494 F. 3d 458, 473\u2013475 (CA4 2007) (en banc)\n(where complaint named parent company Praxair, Inc.,\nbut described status of subsidiary company Praxair Ser\nvices, Inc., subsidiary company knew or should have\nknown it had not been named because of plaintiff\u2019s mis\ntake). In addition, Costa Crociere\u2019s own actions contrib\nuted to passenger confusion over \u201cthe proper party\u201d for a\nlawsuit. The front of the ticket advertises that \u201cCosta\nCruises\u201d has achieved a certification of quality, App. to\nPet. for Cert. 25a, without clarifying whether \u201cCosta\nCruises\u201d is Costa Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, or some\nother related \u201cCosta\u201d company. Indeed, Costa Crociere is\nevidently aware that the difference between Costa Cruise\nand Costa Crociere can be confusing for cruise ship pas\nsengers. See, e.g., Suppa v. Costa Crociere, S. p.
