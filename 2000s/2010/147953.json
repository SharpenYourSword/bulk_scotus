LANNING\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 08\u2013998.     Argued March 22, 2010\u2014Decided June 7, 2010\nDebtors filing for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\n must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors\n out of their future income. If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured\n creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless\n it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or \u201cprovides\n that all of the debtor\u2019s projected disposable income to be received\u201d\n over the plan\u2019s duration \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d in accor\n dance with plan terms. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(1). Before enactment of\n the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n 2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined \u201cdisposable income.\u201d\n Though it did not define \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d most bank\n ruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying\n monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then de\n termining the \u201cdisposable\u201d portion of the result. In exceptional cases,\n those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor\u2019s\n income or expenses. BAPCPA defines \u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201ccur\n rent monthly income received by the debtor\u201d less \u201camounts reasona\n bly necessary to be expended\u201d for, e.g., the debtor\u2019s maintenance and\n support. \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i). \u201cCurrent monthly income,\u201d in turn, is cal\n culated by averaging the debtor\u2019s monthly income during a 6-month\n look-back period preceding the petition\u2019s filing. See \u00a7101(10A)(A)(i).\n If a debtor\u2019s income is below the median for his or her State,\n \u201camounts reasonably necessary\u201d include the full amount needed for\n \u201cmaintenance or support,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtor\u2019s in\n come exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are\n included, see \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n    A one-time buyout from respondent\u2019s former employer caused her\n current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13\n2                       HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    petition to exceed her State\u2019s median income. However, based on the\n    income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her\n    expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03. She\n    thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month\n    for 36 months. Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confir\n    mation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less\n    than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because\n    she had not committed all of her \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to re\n    paying creditors. Petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach\n    was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income, and that\n    using that approach, respondent should pay $756 per month for 60\n    months. Her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.\n      The Bankruptcy Court endorsed a $144 payment over a 60-month\n    period, concluding that \u201cprojected\u201d requires courts to consider the\n    debtor\u2019s actual income. The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel affirmed, as did the Tenth Circuit, which held that a court cal\n    culating \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d should begin with the \u201cpre\n    sumption\u201d that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is cor\n    rect, but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial\n    change in the debtor\u2019s circumstances.\nHeld: When a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor\u2019s projected dispos\n able income, the court may account for changes in the debtor\u2019s income\n or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confir\n mation. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) Respondent has the better interpretation of \u201cprojected dispos\n able income.\u201d First, such a forward-looking approach is supported by\n the ordinary meaning of \u201cprojected.\u201d See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winter\n boer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. In ordinary usage future occurrences are\n not \u201cprojected\u201d based on the assumption that the past will necessarily\n repeat itself. While a projection takes past events into account, ad\n justments are often made based on other factors that may affect the\n outcome. Second, \u201cprojected\u201d appears in many federal statutes, yet\n Congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication. See, e.g., 7\n U. S. C. \u00a71301(b)(8)(B). By contrast, as the Bankruptcy Code shows,\n Congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambigu\n ous\u2014commonly using the term \u201cmultiplied.\u201d See, e.g., 11 U. S. C.\n \u00a71325(b)(3). Third, under pre-BAPCPA case law, the general rule\n was that courts would multiply a debtor\u2019s current monthly income by\n the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in\n determining projected disposable income, but would also have discre\n tion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor\u2019s\n income. This is significant, since the Court \u201cwill not read the Bank\n ruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indica\n tion that Congress intended such a departure,\u201d Travelers Casualty &\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nSurety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443, 454,\nand Congress did not amend the term \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d\nin 2005. Pp. 6\u201310.\n   (b) The mechanical approach also clashes with \u00a71325\u2019s terms.\nFirst, \u00a71325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s reference to projected disposable income \u201cto be\nreceived in the applicable commitment period\u201d strongly favors the\nforward-looking approach. Because respondent would have far less\nthan $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, pe\ntitioner\u2019s projection does not accurately reflect disposable income \u201cto\nbe received.\u201d In such circumstances, the mechanical approach effec\ntively reads that phrase out of the statute. Second, \u00a71325(b)(1)\u2019s di\nrection to courts to determine projected disposable income \u201cas of the\neffective date of the plan,\u201d\u2014 i.e., the confirmation date\u2014is more con\nsistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information\nabout a debtor\u2019s financial situation. Had Congress intended for pro\njected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable\nincome, it could have specified the plan\u2019s filing date as the effective\ndate. Third, \u00a71325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s requirement that projected disposable\nincome \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d is rendered a hollow\ncommand if, as of the plan\u2019s effective date, the debtor lacks the\nmeans to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts. Pp. 11\u2013\n12.\n   (c) The arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unper\nsuasive. The claim that the Code\u2019s detailed and precise \u201cdisposable\nincome\u201d definition would have no purpose without the mechanical\napproach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula\nplays under the forward-looking approach, which begins with a dis\nposable income calculation. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s rebuttable \u201cpre\nsumption\u201d analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of \u201cprojected.\u201d\nThis Court rejects petitioner\u2019s argument that only the mechanical\napproach is consistent with \u00a71129(a)(15)(B), which refers to \u201cpro\njected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).\u201d And the Court declines to infer from the fact that\n\u00a71325(b)(3) incorporates \u00a7707\u2014which allows courts to consider \u201cspe\ncial circumstances,\u201d but only with respect to calculating expenses\u2014\nthat Congress intended to eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that\ncourts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain\nchanges. Pp. 12\u201314.\n   (d) Petitioner\u2019s proposed strategies for avoiding or mitigating the\nharsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debt\nors\u2014a debtor could delay filing a petition so as to place any extraor\ndinary income outside the 6-month period; a debtor with unusually\nhigh income during that period could seek leave to delay filing a\nschedule of current income and ask the bankruptcy court to select a\n4                       HAMILTON v.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a7101(30),\n109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must\nliquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,\nsee \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to\nkeep their property, but they must agree to a court\u00ad\napproved plan under which they pay creditors out of their\nfuture income, see \u00a7\u00a71306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A\nbankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a\nChapter 13 debtor\u2019s plan. \u00a71322(a)(1); see also 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7586(a)(3).\n   Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under\nwhich a bankruptcy court \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay not\u201d confirm a\nplan. \u00a71325(a),(b). If an unsecured creditor or the bank\u00ad\nruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, \u00a71325(b)(1) requires\nthe debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to\npay all \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to be received by the\ndebtor over the duration of the plan.\n2                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court\nshould calculate a debtor\u2019s \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d\nSome lower courts have taken what the parties term the\n\u201cmechanical approach,\u201d while most have adopted what has\nbeen called the \u201cforward-looking approach.\u201d We hold that\nthe \u201cforward-looking approach\u201d is correct.\n                              I\n   As previously noted, \u00a71325 provides that if a trustee or\nan unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debtor\u2019s\nplan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless\nit provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or\n\u201cprovides that all of the debtor\u2019s projected disposable\nincome to be received\u201d over the duration of the plan \u201cwill\nbe applied to make payments\u201d in accordance with the\nterms of the plan. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(1); see also\n\u00a71325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code)\nloosely defined \u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201cincome which is\nreceived by the debtor and which is not reasonably neces\u00ad\nsary to be expended\u201d for the \u201cmaintenance or support of\nthe debtor,\u201d for qualifying charitable contributions, or for\nbusiness expenditures. \u00a71325(b)(2)(A), (B).\n   The Code did not define the term \u201cprojected disposable\nincome,\u201d and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a\nmechanical approach in calculating projected disposable\nincome. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by\nthe number of months in the plan and then determined\nwhat portion of the result was \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cdisposable.\u201d\nSee 2 K.

See \u00a7101(10A)(A)(i).1      The phrase\n\u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d in\n\u00a71325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose\nincome is below the median for his or her State, the\nphrase includes the full amount needed for \u201cmaintenance\nor support,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with\nincome that exceeds the state median, only certain speci\u00ad\nfied expenses are included,2 see \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 However,  if a debtor does not file the required schedule (Schedule I),\nthe bankruptcy court may select a different 6-month period.

In the six months before her filing, she received a\none-time buyout from her former employer, and this pay\u00ad\nment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to\n$11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84,\n107. As a result of these payments, respondent\u2019s current\nmonthly income, as averaged from April through October\n2006, was $5,343.70\u2014a figure that exceeds the median\nincome for a family of one in Kansas. See id., at 78. Re\u00ad\nspondent\u2019s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to\n\u00a7707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a\nmonthly \u201cdisposable income\u201d of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.\nIbid.\n   On the form used for reporting monthly income (Sched\u00ad\nule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per\nmonth\u2014which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see\nalso id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly\nexpenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly ex\u00ad\npenses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule\nJ figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly\ndisposable income of $149.03.\n   Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to\npay $144 per month for 36 months. See id., at 93. Peti\u00ad\ntioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirma\u00ad\ntion of the plan because the amount respondent proposed\nto pay was less than the full amount of the claims against\nher, see \u00a71325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner\u2019s view,\nrespondent was not committing all of her \u201cprojected dis\u00ad\nposable income\u201d to the repayment of creditors, see\n\u00a71325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to\ncalculate projected disposable income was simply to mul\u00ad\ntiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the\nnumber of months in the commitment period.

This conclusion was warranted by the text of\n\u00a71325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was\nnecessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bank\u00ad\nruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating fi\u00ad\nnances in the six months before filing. Ibid.\n   Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007).\nThe Panel noted that, although Congress redefined \u201cdis\u00ad\nposable income\u201d in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre\u00ad\nexisting term \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d Id., at 24.\nThus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe\nthat Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice\nunder which bankruptcy courts determined projected\ndisposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but\nconsidered other evidence when there was reason to be\u00ad\nlieve that the schedules did not reflect a debtor\u2019s actual\nability to pay. Ibid.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F. 3d 1269, 1270\n(2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calcu\u00ad\nlating \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d should begin with the\n\u201cpresumption\u201d that the figure yielded by the mechanical\n6                 HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\napproach is correct, but the Court concluded that this\nfigure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change\nin the debtor\u2019s circumstances. Id., at 1278\u20131279.\n   This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558\nU. S. ___ (2009).\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of\n\u00a71325\u2019s reference to \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d Peti\u00ad\ntioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that\n\u201cprojected disposable income\u201d means past average monthly\ndisposable income multiplied by the number of months in\na debtor\u2019s plan. Respondent, who favors the forward\u00ad\nlooking approach, agrees that the method outlined by\npetitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she\nargues that in exceptional cases, where significant\nchanges in a debtor\u2019s financial circumstances are known or\nvirtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to\nmake an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the\nstronger argument.\n   First, respondent\u2019s argument is supported by the ordi\u00ad\nnary meaning of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d \u201cWhen terms used\nin a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary\nmeaning.\u201d Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179,\n187 (1995). Here, the term \u201cprojected\u201d is not defined, and\nin ordinary usage future occurrences are not \u201cprojected\u201d\nbased on the assumption that the past will necessarily\nrepeat itself. For example, projections concerning a com\u00ad\npany\u2019s future sales or the future cash flow from a license\ntake into account anticipated events that may change past\ntrends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,\nLtd., 551 U. S. 308, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to\n\u201cprojected sales\u201d in light of falling demand); Innovair\nAviation, Ltd. v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504\u2013\n506 (2008) (calculating projected cash flow and noting that\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npast sales are \u201cnot necessarily the number of sales\u201d that\nwill be made in the future). On the night of an election,\nexperts do not \u201cproject\u201d the percentage of the votes that a\ncandidate will receive by simply assuming that the candi\u00ad\ndate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the\nfirst few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not\nproject that a team\u2019s winning percentage at the end of a\nnew season will be the same as the team\u2019s winning per\u00ad\ncentage last year or the team\u2019s winning percentage at the\nend of the first month of competition. While a projection\ntakes past events into account, adjustments are often\nmade based on other factors that may affect the final\noutcome. See In re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy.\nApp. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting \u201cmultiplied,\u201d which\n\u201crequires only mathematical acumen,\u201d with \u201cprojected,\u201d\nwhich requires \u201cmathematic acumen adjusted by delibera\u00ad\ntion and discretion\u201d).\n   Second, the word \u201cprojected\u201d appears in many federal\nstatutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple\nmultiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment\nAct of 1938 defined \u201cprojected national yield,\u201d \u201cprojected\ncounty yield,\u201d and \u201cprojected farm yield\u201d as entailing\nhistorical averages \u201cadjusted for abnormal weather condi\u00ad\ntions,\u201d \u201ctrends in yields,\u201d and \u201cany significant changes in\nproduction practices.\u201d 7 U.

LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   By contrast, we need look no further than the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate\nsimple multiplication, it does so unambiguously\u2014most\ncommonly by using the term \u201cmultiplied.\u201d See, e.g., 11\nU. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(3) (\u201ccurrent monthly income, when mul\u00ad\ntiplied by 12\u201d); \u00a7\u00a7704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same);\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (\u201cmultiplied by 60\u201d).

S. C. \u00a7403(f)(3) (\u201cmulti\u00ad\nplied by the number of months in such year\u201d).\n   Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the\n\u201cforward-looking\u201d approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the gen\u00ad\neral rule was that courts would multiply a debtor\u2019s current\nmonthly income by the number of months in the commit\u00ad\nment period as the first step in determining projected\ndisposable income. See, e.g., In re Killough, 900 F. 2d 61,\n62\u201363 (CA5 1990) (per curiam); In re Anderson, 21 F. 3d\n355, 357 (CA9 1994); In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128, 1132\n(CA4 1995). See 2 Lundin \u00a7164.1, at 164\u20131 (2000 ed.)\n(\u201cMost courts focus on the debtor\u2019s current income and\nextend current income (and expenditures) over the life of\nthe plan to calculate projected disposable income\u201d). But\ncourts also had discretion to account for known or virtu\u00ad\nally certain changes in the debtor\u2019s income. See Heath,\n182 B. R., at 559\u2013561; Richardson, 283 B.

In In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128 (1995), for example, the\nFourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment because it deemed\ndisbursements from an individual retirement account during the plan\nperiod to be \u201cspeculative\u201d and \u201chypothetical.\u201d Id., at 1132. There is no\nreason to assume that the result would have been the same if future\ndisbursements had been more assured. That was certainly true of In re\nKillough, 900 F. 2d 61 (1990), in which the Fifth Circuit declined to\nrequire inclusion of overtime pay in projected disposable income be\u00ad\ncause it \u201cwas not definite enough.\u201d Id., at 65; see also id., at 66\n(\u201c[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working\novertime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor\u2019s pro\u00ad\njected disposable income\u201d).

Indeed, petitioner\nconcedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to\nBAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.\n   Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we\n\u201c \u2018will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bank\u00ad\nruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress\nintended such a departure.\u2019 \u201d Travelers Casualty & Surety\nCo. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443,\n454 (2007); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526,\n539 (2004); Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998);\nsee also Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); Kelly\nv. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 47 (1986). Congress did not\namend the term \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d in 2005,\nand pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely\nacknowledged and well-documented view that courts may\ntake into account known or virtually certain changes to\ndebtors\u2019 income or expenses when projecting disposable\nincome. In light of this historical practice, we would ex\u00ad\npect that, had Congress intended for \u201cprojected\u201d to carry a\nspecialized\u2014and indeed, unusual\u2014meaning in Chapter\n13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., e.g., 26\nU. S. C. \u00a7279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining \u201cprojected\nearnings\u201d as reflecting a 3-year historical average).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

C. \u00a71325.\n   First, \u00a71325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s reference to projected disposable\nincome \u201cto be received in the applicable commitment\nperiod\u201d strongly favors the forward-looking approach.\nThere is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive\nfar less than $756 per month in disposable income during\nthe plan period, so petitioner\u2019s projection does not accu\u00ad\nrately reflect \u201cincome to be received\u201d during that period.\nSee In re Nowlin, 576 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The\nmechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of\nthe statute when a debtor\u2019s current disposable income is\nsubstantially higher than the income that the debtor\npredictably will receive during the plan period. See\nKawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (\u201c[W]e are\nhesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional\nenactment which renders superfluous another portion of\nthat same law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Second, \u00a71325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected\ndisposable income \u201cas of the effective date of the plan,\u201d\nwhich is the date on which the plan is confirmed and\nbecomes binding, see \u00a71327(a). Had Congress intended for\nprojected disposable income to be nothing more than a\nmultiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no rea\u00ad\nson why Congress would not have required courts to de\u00ad\ntermine that value as of the filing date of the plan. See\nFed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be\nfiled within 14 days of the filing of a petition), online at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulema\nking/Overview/BankruptcyRules.aspx (all Internet mate\u00ad\nrials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file). In the very next section of the Code, for\nexample, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence\npayments \u201cnot later than 30 days after the date of the\nfiling of the plan.\u201d \u00a71326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Con\u00ad\n12                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019 decision to require courts to measure projected\ndisposable income \u201cas of the effective date of the plan\u201d is\nmore consistent with the view that Congress expected\ncourts to consider postfiling information about the debtor\u2019s\nfinancial circumstances.        See 545 F. 3d, at 1279\n(\u201c[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all\nprojected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured\ncreditors \u2018as of the effective date of the plan\u2019 suggests\nconsideration of the debtor\u2019s actual financial circum\u00ad\nstances as of the effective date of the plan\u201d).\n   Third, the requirement that projected disposable income\n\u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d is most naturally read\nto contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors\nin the calculated monthly amounts. \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). But\nwhen, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks\nthe means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow\ncommand.\n                             C\n   The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical\napproach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now\nprovides a detailed and precise definition of \u201cdisposable\nincome,\u201d proponents of the mechanical approach maintain\nthat any departure from this method leaves that definition\n\u201c \u2018with no apparent purpose.\u2019 \u201d In re Kagenveama, 541 F.\n3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the\nimportant role that the statutory formula for calculating\n\u201cdisposable income\u201d plays under the forward-looking\napproach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a\ncourt taking the forward-looking approach should begin by\ncalculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing\nmore is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court\nmay go further and take into account other known or\nvirtually certain information about the debtor\u2019s future\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference\nto any such presumption but that related Code provisions\nexpressly create other rebuttable presumptions.         See\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the\nTenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the\nCode.\n  The Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, however, simply heeds the\nordinary meaning of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d As noted, a\nperson making a projection uses past occurrences as a\nstarting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Cir\u00ad\ncuit prescribed. See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.\n  Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is\nconsistent with \u00a71129(a)(15)(B), which refers to \u201cprojected\ndisposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).\u201d    This cross-reference, petitioner argues,\nshows that Congress intended for the term \u201cprojected\ndisposable income\u201d to incorporate, presumably in all con\u00ad\ntexts, the defined term \u201cdisposable income.\u201d It is evident\nthat \u00a71129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term \u201cdis-\nposable income,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2), but that fact offers\nno insight into the meaning of the word \u201cprojected\u201d\nin \u00a7\u00a71129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see\nhow that word acquires a specialized meaning as a\nresult of this cross-reference\u2014particularly where both\n\u00a7\u00a71129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected dis\u00ad\nposable income \u201cto be received\u201d during the relevant period.\nSee supra, at 11.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 For the same reason, the phrase \u201c[f]or purposes of this subsection\u201d\n\nin \u00a71325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking\napproach.\n14                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner also notes that \u00a7707 allows courts to take\n\u201cspecial circumstances\u201d into consideration, but that\n\u00a71325(b)(3) incorporates \u00a7707 only with respect to calcu\u00ad\nlating expenses. See In re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314\u2013315\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a \u201cspecial\ncircumstances\u201d exception should not be inferred with\nrespect to the debtor\u2019s income. We decline to infer from\n\u00a71325\u2019s incorporation of \u00a7707 that Congress intended to\neliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previ\u00ad\nously exercised when projecting disposable income to\naccount for known or virtually certain changes.

Ct.\nNJ 2008).\n                            D\n   In cases in which a debtor\u2019s disposable income during\nthe 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower\nor higher than the debtor\u2019s disposable income during the\nplan period, the mechanical approach would produce\nsenseless results that we do not think Congress intended.\nIn cases in which the debtor\u2019s disposable income is higher\nduring the plan period, the mechanical approach would\ndeny creditors payments that the debtor could easily\nmake. And where, as in the present case, the debtor\u2019s\ndisposable income during the plan period is substantially\nlower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection\nof Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter\u2019s main\neligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is\nan \u201cindividual whose income is sufficiently stable and\nregular\u201d to allow her \u201cto make payments under a plan,\u201d\n\u00a7101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in\n\u00a7109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she\ncould not file a confirmable plan. Under \u00a71325(a)(6), a\nplan cannot be confirmed unless \u201cthe debtor will be able to\nmake all payments under the plan and comply with the\nplan.\u201d And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

He\nproposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by\nthe mechanical approach, and in any event none of the\nmaneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.\n                               1\n   Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a\npetition so as to place any extraordinary income outside\nthe 6-month look-back period. We see at least two prob\u00ad\nlems with this proposal.\n   First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor\nsliding into bankruptcy.\n      \u201cPotential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a law\u00ad\n    yer\u2019s office when they are one step from financial\n    Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the\n    debtor\u2019s home the next day; the debtor\u2019s only car\n    was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last\n    night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor\u2019s\n    take-home pay below the ordinary requirements\n    of food and rent.       Instantaneous relief is ex-\n    pected, if not necessary.\u201d K. Lundin & W.

See 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(a)(7) (requiring,\nas a condition of confirmation, that \u201cthe action of the\ndebtor in filing the petition was in good faith\u201d); see also,\n16                     HAMILTON v.

Accord, Neufeld v. Freeman, 794 F. 2d 149,\n153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor\u2019s prepetition conduct may inform\nthe court\u2019s good-faith inquiry).\n                             2\n  Petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually\nhigh income during the 6 months prior to the filing of a\npetition, could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of\ncurrent income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy\ncourt to exercise its authority under \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii) to\nselect a 6-month period that is more representative of the\ndebtor\u2019s future disposable income. We see little merit in\nthis convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of\nthe mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would\nimproperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as\nwe believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence\nto the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is\nnot needed. In any event, even if this strategy were al\u00ad\nlowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable\nincome during the plan period is sharply lower than their\nprevious disposable income.6\n                             3\n   Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the peti\u00ad\ntion and refile at a later, more favorable date. But peti\u00ad\ntioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts \u201cgener\u00ad\nally\u201d do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for\nPetitioner 53.

The\navailability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who\nhave above-median incomes is limited. In respondent\u2019s\ncase, a presumption of abuse would attach under\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, \u201cmultiplied\nby 60,\u201d exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and\n(II). See also \u00a7707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a\npetition filed by a debtor \u201cwhose debts are primarily con\u00ad\nsumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of relief would\nbe an abuse of the provisions of this chapter\u201d); App. 86\u201388\n(\u201cNotice to Individual Consumer Debtor under \u00a7342(b) of\nthe Bankruptcy Code\u201d) (\u201cIf your income is greater than the\nmedian income for your state of residence and family size,\nin some cases, creditors have the right to file a motion\nrequesting that the court dismiss your case under \u00a7707(b)\nof the Code\u201d).

S. C. \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). The Code provides a formula for\n\u201cproject[ing]\u201d what a debtor\u2019s \u201cdisposable income\u201d will be,\nwhich so far as his earnings are concerned turns only on\nhis past income. The Court concludes that this formula\nshould not apply in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d where \u201cknown or\nvirtually certain\u201d changes in the debtor\u2019s circumstances\nmake it a poor predictor.

The Code does not define \u201cprojected dis\nposable income,\u201d but it does define \u201cdisposable income.\u201d\nThe next paragraph of \u00a71325(b) provides that \u201c[f]or pur\nposes of this subsection, the term \u2018disposable income\u2019\nmeans current monthly income received by the debtor,\u201d\nexcluding certain payments received for child support,\n\u201cless amounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d on\nthree categories of expenses. \u00a71325(b)(2). The Code in\nturn defines \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d as \u201cthe average\nmonthly income from all sources that the debtor re\nceives . . . derived during the 6-month period ending on\u201d\none of two dates.1 \u00a7101(10A)(A). Whichever date applies,\na debtor\u2019s \u201ccurrent monthly income,\u201d and thus the income\ncomponent of his \u201cdisposable income,\u201d is a sum certain, a\nrate fixed once for all based on historical figures.\n   This definition of \u201cdisposable income\u201d applies to the use\nof that term in the longer phrase \u201cprojected disposable\nincome\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B), since the definition says that it\napplies to subsection (b). Cf. \u00a71129(a)(15)(B) (referring to\n\u201cthe projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined\nin section 1325(b)(2))\u201d). The puzzle is what to make of the\nword \u201cprojected.\u201d\n   In the Court\u2019s view, this modifier makes all the differ\nence. Projections, it explains, ordinarily account for later\ndevelopments, not just past data. Ante, at 6\u20137. Thus, the\nCourt concludes, in determining \u201cprojected disposable\nincome\u201d a bankruptcy court may depart from \u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 If\n      the debtor files a schedule of current income, as ordinarily re\nquired by \u00a7521(a)(1)(B)(ii), then the 6-month period ends on the last\nday of the month preceding the date the case is commenced,\n\u00a7101(10A)(A)(i)\u2014that is, when the petition is filed, \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 302(a),\n303(b). If the debtor does not file such a schedule on time\u2014which the\nbankruptcy court apparently may excuse him from doing,\n\u00a7521(a)(1)(B)(ii)\u2014the 6-month period ends on the date the bankruptcy\ncourt determines the debtor\u2019s current income. \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Ante, at 6.\n   That interpretation runs aground because it either\nrenders superfluous text Congress included or requires\nadding text Congress did not. It would be pointless to\ndefine disposable income in such detail, based on data\nduring a specific 6-month period, if a court were free to set\nthe resulting figure aside whenever it appears to be a poor\npredictor. And since \u201cdisposable income\u201d appears nowhere\nelse in \u00a71325(b), then unless \u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s definition ap\nplies to \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B), it\ndoes not apply at all.\n   The Court insists its interpretation does not render\n\u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s incorporation of \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d a\nnullity: A bankruptcy court must still begin with that\nfigure, but is simply free to fiddle with it if a \u201csignificant\u201d\nchange in the debtor\u2019s circumstances is \u201cknown or virtu\nally certain.\u201d Ante, at 6, 12. That construction conven\niently avoids superfluity, but only by utterly abandoning\nthe text the Court purports to construe. Nothing in the\ntext supports treating the definition of disposable income\nCongress supplied as a suggestion. And even if the word\n\u201cprojected\u201d did allow (or direct) a court to disregard\n\u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s fixed formula and to consider other data,\nthere would be no basis in the text for the restrictions the\nCourt reads in, regarding when and to what extent a court\nmay (or must) do so. If the statute authorizes estimations,\nit authorizes them in every case, not just those where\nchanges to the debtor\u2019s income are both \u201csignificant\u201d and\neither \u201cknown or virtually certain.\u201d Ibid. If the evidence\nindicates it is merely more likely than not that the\ndebtor\u2019s income will increase by some minimal amount,\nthere is no reading of the word \u201cprojected\u201d that permits (or\nrequires) a court to ignore that change. The Court, in\nshort, can arrive at its compromise construction only by\n4                  HAMILTON v.

But one\nassuredly can calculate, predict, or estimate future figures\nbased on the past. And here Congress has commanded\nthat a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the\nprojection.\n   The Court rejects this reading as unrealistic. A projec\ntion, the Court explains, may be based in part on past\ndata, but \u201cadjustments are often made based on other\nfactors that may affect the final outcome.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. No\ngambler would bet the farm using \u201cproject[ions]\u201d that are\nbased only on a football team\u2019s play before its star quar\nterback was injured. And no pundit would keep his post if\nhe \u201cprojected\u201d election results relying only on prior cycles,\nignoring recent polls.

One who is asked to predict future results, but\nis armed with no other information than prior perform\nance, can still make a projection; it may simply be off the\nmark. Congress, of course, could have tried to prevent\nthat possibility by prescribing, as it has done in other\ncontexts, that a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income be\ndetermined based on the \u201cbest available evidence,\u201d 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71364(c)(2), or \u201cany . . . relevant information,\u201d 25\nU. S. C. \u00a72009(c)(1). But it included no such prescription\nhere, and instead identified the data a court should con\nsider. Perhaps Congress concluded that other information\na bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too\neasily manipulated. Or perhaps it thought the cost of\nconsidering such information outweighed the benefits. Cf.\n7 U. S. C. \u00a71301(b)(13)(J)\u2013(M) (requiring national and\nlocal \u201cprojected\u201d yields of various crops to be adjusted only\nfor abnormal weather, trends in yields, and production\npractices, apparently to the exclusion of other presumably\nrelevant variables such as a sudden increase or decrease\nin the number of producers, farm subsidies, etc.). In all\nevents, neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the\nprojection method Congress chose has any bearing on\nwhat the statute means.\n   The Court contends that if Congress really meant courts\nto multiply a static figure by a set number of months, it\nwould have used the word \u201cmultiplied,\u201d as it has done\nelsewhere\u2014indeed, elsewhere in the same subsection, see,\ne.g., 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(3)\u2014instead of the word \u201cpro\njected.\u201d2 Ante, at 8. I do not dispute that, as a general\nmatter, we should presume that Congress does not ordi\nnarily use two words in the same context to denote the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Of course, since the number of months in the commitment period\n\nmay vary, Congress could not simply have substituted a single word,\nbut would have had to write \u201cdisposable income multiplied by the\nnumber of months in the applicable commitment period\u201d or some such\nphrase.\n6                      HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame thing. But if forced to choose between (A) assuming\nCongress enacted text that serves no purpose at all, (B)\nascribing an unheard-of meaning to the word \u201cprojected\u201d\n(loaded with made-to-order restrictions) simply to avoid\nundesirable results, or (C) assuming Congress employed\nsynonyms to express a single idea, the last is obviously the\nleast evil.\n   In any event, we are not put to that choice here. While\nunder my reading a court must determine the income half\nof the \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d equation by multiply\ning a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the\nexpenses excludable under \u00a71325(b)(2)(A) and (B). Unlike\nthe debtor\u2019s current monthly income, none of the three\ntypes of expenses\u2014payments for the support of the debtor\nand his dependents, charitable contributions, and ex\npenses to keep an existing business above water\u2014is ex\nplicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for\ndebtors with incomes below the state median). The first of\nthose cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based\non the same 6-month period from which current monthly\nincome is derived,3 and the texts of the other two are\nconsistent with determining expenses based on expecta\ntions. See \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(ii) (charitable expenses to quali\nfied entities limited to \u201c15 percent of gross income of the\ndebtor for the year in which the contributions are made\u201d);\n\u00a71325(b)(2)(B) (\u201cexpenditures necessary for the continua\ntion, preservation, and operation\u201d of a business in which\nthe debtor is engaged).\n   In short, a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income consists\nof two parts: one (current monthly income) that is fixed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For a debtor whose income is below the state median, excludable\n\nexpenses include domestic-support obligations \u201cthat first becom[e]\npayable after the date the petition is filed,\u201d \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i)\u2014that is,\nafter the six-month window relevant to the debtor\u2019s current monthly\nincome has closed (unless the debtor does not file a current-income\nschedule), see \u00a7101(10A)(A)(i).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nonce for all based on historical data, and another (the\nenumerated expenses) that at least arguably depends on\nestimations of the debtor\u2019s future circumstances. The\nstatute thus requires the court to predict the difference\nbetween two figures, each of which depends on the dura\ntion of the commitment period, and one of which also turns\npartly on facts besides historical data. In light of all this,\nit seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process\nas projection, not merely multiplication.\n                              C\n   The Court\u2019s remaining arguments about the statute\u2019s\nmeaning are easily dispatched. A \u201cmechanical\u201d reading of\nprojected disposable income, it contends, renders superflu\nous the phrase \u201cto be received in the applicable commit\nment period\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 11. Not at all.\nThat phrase defines the period for which a debtor\u2019s dis\nposable income must be calculated (i.e., the period over\nwhich the projection extends), and thus the amount the\ndebtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.\n   Similarly insubstantial is the Court\u2019s claim regarding\nthe requirement that the plan provide that the debtor\u2019s\nprojected disposable income \u201cwill be applied to make\npayments\u201d      toward     unsecured    creditors\u2019    claims,\n\u00a71325(b)(1)(B). The Court says this requirement makes no\nsense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount\nequal to his projected disposable income. Ante, at 12. But\nit makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is\nentitled to confirmation in the first place; and that as\nsumption is wrong. The requirement that the debtor pay\nat least his projected disposable income is a prerequisite to\nconfirmation. The \u201cwill be applied\u201d proviso does not re\nquire a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds\nChapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.\n   The Court also argues that \u00a71325(b)(1)\u2019s directive to\ndetermine projected disposable income \u201cas of the effective\n8                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndate of the plan\u201d makes no sense if mere multiplication of\nexisting numbers is required. Ante, at 11\u201312. As I have\nexplained, however, \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d may in\nsome cases require more than multiplication (as to ex\npenses), and the estimations involved may vary from the\ndate of the plan\u2019s filing until the date it takes effect.\nMoreover, the provision also applies to the alternative\navenue to confirmation in \u00a71325(b)(1)(A), which requires\nthat \u201cthe value of the property to be distributed under the\nplan\u201d to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the credi\ntor\u2019s claim. As to that requirement, the effective-date\nrequirement makes perfect sense.\n   Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice\nprior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns\nwith the atextual approach the Court adopts today. Ante,\nat 8\u201310. That is unsurprising, since the prior version of\nthe relevant provisions was completely consistent with\nthat approach. The Court is correct that BAPCPA \u201cdid not\namend the term \u2018projected disposable income,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 10.\nBut it did amend the definition of that term. Before 2005,\n\u00a71325(b)(2) defined \u201cdisposable income\u201d simply as \u201cincome\nwhich is received by the debtor and which is not reasona\nbly necessary to be expended\u201d on the same basic types of\nexpenses excluded by the current statute. \u00a71325(b)(2)\n(2000 ed.). Nothing in that terse definition compelled a\ncourt to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6\nmonth period. But in BAPCPA\u2014the same Act in which\nCongress defined \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d in\n\u00a7101(10A)(A)\u2014Congress redefined \u201cdisposable income\u201d in\n\u00a71325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking defini\ntion. See Pub. L. 109\u20138, \u00a7102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32\u201334.\nGiven these significant changes, the fact that the Court\u2019s\napproach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only\ndoes not recommend it, see e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of\nPublic Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552, 563\u2013564\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Even if it were\ntrue that a \u201cmechanical\u201d reading resulted in undesirable\noutcomes, that would make no difference. Lewis v. Chi\ncago, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11). For even\nassuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know\nwhich results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoid\ning) apart from the only congressional expression of its\nthoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrele\nvant to what the statute means.\n  In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as\ninevitable nor as \u201csenseless\u201d as the Court portrays. The\nCourt\u2019s first concern is that if actual or anticipated\nchanges in the debtor\u2019s earnings are ignored, then a debtor\nwhose income increases after the critical 6-month window\nwill not be required to pay all he can afford. Ante, at 14.\nBut as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22\u201323,\nChapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the re\nquest of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan \u201c[a]t any\ntime after confirmation\u201d to \u201cincrease . . . the amount of\npayments\u201d on a class of claims or \u201creduce the time for such\npayments.\u201d \u00a71329(a)(1)\u2013(2) (2006 ed.). The Court offers\nno explanation of why modification would not be available\nin such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.\n  The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor\nwhose income suddenly declines after the 6-month window\nor who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during\nthat window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief be\ncause he will be unable to devote his \u201cdisposable income\u201d\n(which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unse\ncured creditors going forward. Ante, at 14\u201315. At least for\n10                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndebtors whose circumstances deteriorate after confirma\ntion, however, the Code already provides an answer. Just\nas a creditor can request an upward modification in light\nof postconfirmation developments, so too can a debtor ask\nfor a downward adjustment. \u00a71329(a). Cf. \u00a71329(b)(1)\n(requiring that modifications meet requirements of\n\u00a7\u00a71322(a)\u2013(b), 1323(c), and 1325(a), but not \u00a71325(b)).\n   Moreover, even apart from the availability of modifica\ntion it requires little imagination to see why Congress\nmight want to withhold relief from debtors whose situa\ntions have suddenly deteriorated (after or even toward the\nend of the 6-month window), or who in the midst of dire\nstraits have been blessed (within the 6-month window) by\nan influx of unusually high income. Bankruptcy protec\ntion is not a birthright, and Congress could reasonably\nconclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet\nneed a reprieve from repaying their debts; perhaps they\nwill recover. And perhaps the debtor who has received a\none-time bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat.\nHow long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is\ninherently a policy choice. Congress confined the calcula\ntion of current monthly income to a 6-month period (ordi\nnarily ending before the case is commenced), but it could\nhave picked 2 or 12 months (or a different end date) in\nstead. Whatever the wisdom of the window it chose, we\nshould not assume it did not know what it was doing and\naccordingly refuse to give effect to its words.\n   Even if one insists on making provision for such debtors,\nthe Court is wrong to write off four alternative strategies\nthe trustee suggests, Brief for Petitioner 50\u201354:\n   \u25cf Presumably some debtors whose income has only\nrecently been reduced, or who have just received a jolt that\ncauses a temporary uptick in their average income, can\ndelay filing a Chapter 13 petition until their \u201ccurrent\nmonthly income\u201d catches up with their present circum\nstances.

See \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii). The Court\ndismisses this alternative, explaining that if the Code\nrequires a mechanical approach this solution would \u201cim\nproperly undermine\u201d it, and if the Code allows exceptions\nfor changed circumstances the solution is unnecessary.\nAnte, at 16. The second premise is correct, but the first is\nnot. Congress does not pursue its purposes at all costs.\nRodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987)\n(per curiam). Here it may have struck the very balance\nthe Court thinks critical by creating a fixed formula but\nleaving leeway as to the time to which it applies.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Neither of the two Court of Appeals cases the Court cites\u2014In re\n\nMyers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007), and Neufeld v. Freeman, 794\nF. 2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986)\u2014involved a debtor\u2019s delaying his petition\nuntil his circumstances would permit the court to confirm a repayment\nplan.\n  5 The Court observes that not every debtor will benefit from this ex\n\nception, ante, at 16, and n. 6, since \u00a7521(i)(3) provides that a bank\nruptcy court may not grant a request (which may be made after the\ndeadline for filing the current-income schedule) for an extension of\nmore than 45 days to file such a schedule. But the statute appears to\nassume that a court may excuse the filing of such a schedule altogether:\nA debtor is required to file a schedule in the first instance \u201cunless the\ncourt orders otherwise,\u201d \u00a7521(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).             And\n\u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii)\u2019s provision of a method for calculating current monthly\nincome \u201cif the debtor does not file the schedule of current income\nrequired by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)\u201d makes little sense unless a court\ncan excuse the failure to do so, since an unexcused failure to do so\nwould be a basis for dismissing the case, see \u00a7521(i). Allowing courts to\nexcuse such schedules does not render superfluous \u00a7521(i)(3)\u2019s authori\n12                     HAMILTON v.

The\nCourt worries that this alternative also might be deemed\nabusive, again with no pertinent authority for the specula\ntion.6 Its concern is based primarily on its belief that this\n\u201ccircumvents the statutory limits on a court\u2019s ability to\nshift the look-back period.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317. That belief is\nmistaken, both because the Court exaggerates the statu\ntory limitations on adjusting the look-back period, and\nbecause, just as it does not defeat the disposable-income\nformula\u2019s rigidity to allow adjustments regarding the time\nof determining that figure, it would not undermine the\nlimitations on adjustment applicable in a pending case to\nallow the debtor to dismiss and refile.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nzation for limited extensions, since that applies to extensions sought up\nto 45 days after the filing deadline, whereas \u00a7521(a)(1)(B) seems to\napply only before the deadline.\n   6 The sole authority the Court supplies\u2014a single Bankruptcy Court\n\ndecision predating BAPCPA\u2014provides no support. See In re Glenn,\n288 B. R. 516, 519\u2013521 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002). Although ac\nknowledging that \u201c[m]ultiple filings by a debtor are not, in and of\nthemselves, improper,\u201d the court did note that \u201cwhether this is the first\nor subsequent filin[g]\u201d by the debtor is one among the \u201ctotality of the\ncircumstances\u201d to be considered in a good-faith analysis. Id., at 520\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The debtor in the case at hand had\nfiled three previous Chapter 13 petitions, \u201ceach on the eve of a sched\nuled foreclosure,\u201d and according to the court \u201cnever had any intention of\nfollowing through with any of the Chapter 13 cases,\u201d but had used the\nbankruptcy process \u201cto hold [his creditor] hostage, while remaining in\nhis residence without paying for it.\u201d Id., at 520\u2013521.\n   7 The Court also notes that the Code precludes a debtor who has had\n\na case pending in the last 180 days from refiling if his prior case was\ndismissed because he willfully failed to obey the court\u2019s orders or to\nappear before the court, \u00a7109(g)(1), or if he voluntarily dismissed the\nprior suit \u201cfollowing the filing of a request for relief from the automatic\nstay\u201d under \u00a7362, \u00a7109(g)(2). Ante, at 17, n. 7. But the Court does not\nexplain why these barriers have any bearing on whether refiling for\nbankruptcy would be abusive when the barriers do not apply.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The\nCourt declares this cold comfort, noting that some debt\nors\u2014including Lanning\u2014will have incomes too high to\nqualify for Chapter 7. Ante, at 17\u201318. Some such debtors,\nhowever, may be able to show \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7. Aside\nfrom noting the absence of authority on the issue, the\nCourt\u2019s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the\nspecial-circumstances exception is available only if the\ndebtor has \u201cno reasonable alternative,\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(B)(i),\nwhich will not be true after today given the Court\u2019s hold\ning that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a\ndebtor\u2019s income. As for those who cannot establish special\ncircumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause\nfor concern. Congress has evidently concluded that such\ndebtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and\nthat they are not suitable candidates for repaying their\ndebts (at least in part) under Chapter 13\u2019s protective\numbrella.

Argued March 22, 2010\u2014Decided June 7, 2010\nDebtors filing for protection under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\n must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors\n out of their future income. If the bankruptcy trustee or an unsecured\n creditor objects, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless\n it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or \u201cprovides\n that all of the debtor\u2019s projected disposable income to be received\u201d\n over the plan\u2019s duration \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d in accor\n dance with plan terms. 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(1). Before enactment of\n the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n 2005 (BAPCPA), the Code loosely defined \u201cdisposable income.\u201d\n Though it did not define \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d most bank\n ruptcy courts calculated it using a mechanical approach, multiplying\n monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then de\n termining the \u201cdisposable\u201d portion of the result. In exceptional cases,\n those courts also took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor\u2019s\n income or expenses. BAPCPA defines \u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201ccur\n rent monthly income received by the debtor\u201d less \u201camounts reasona\n bly necessary to be expended\u201d for, e.g., the debtor\u2019s maintenance and\n support. \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i). \u201cCurrent monthly income,\u201d in turn, is cal\n culated by averaging the debtor\u2019s monthly income during a 6-month\n look-back period preceding the petition\u2019s filing. See \u00a7101(10A)(A)(i).\n If a debtor\u2019s income is below the median for his or her State,\n \u201camounts reasonably necessary\u201d include the full amount needed for\n \u201cmaintenance or support,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i), but if the debtor\u2019s in\n come exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are\n included, see \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n    A one-time buyout from respondent\u2019s former employer caused her\n current monthly income for the six months preceding her Chapter 13\n2                       HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    petition to exceed her State\u2019s median income. However, based on the\n    income from her new job, which was below the state median, and her\n    expenses, she reported a monthly disposable income of $149.03. She\n    thus filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month\n    for 36 months. Petitioner, the Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confir\n    mation of the plan because the proposed payment amount was less\n    than the full amount of the claims against respondent, and because\n    she had not committed all of her \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to re\n    paying creditors. Petitioner claimed that the mechanical approach\n    was the proper way to calculate projected disposable income, and that\n    using that approach, respondent should pay $756 per month for 60\n    months. Her actual income was insufficient to make such payments.\n      The Bankruptcy Court endorsed a $144 payment over a 60-month\n    period, concluding that \u201cprojected\u201d requires courts to consider the\n    debtor\u2019s actual income. The Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel affirmed, as did the Tenth Circuit, which held that a court cal\n    culating \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d should begin with the \u201cpre\n    sumption\u201d that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is cor\n    rect, but that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial\n    change in the debtor\u2019s circumstances.\nHeld: When a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor\u2019s projected dispos\n able income, the court may account for changes in the debtor\u2019s income\n or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confir\n mation. Pp. 6\u201318.\n    (a) Respondent has the better interpretation of \u201cprojected dispos\n able income.\u201d First, such a forward-looking approach is supported by\n the ordinary meaning of \u201cprojected.\u201d See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winter\n boer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. In ordinary usage future occurrences are\n not \u201cprojected\u201d based on the assumption that the past will necessarily\n repeat itself. While a projection takes past events into account, ad\n justments are often made based on other factors that may affect the\n outcome. Second, \u201cprojected\u201d appears in many federal statutes, yet\n Congress rarely uses it to mean simple multiplication. See, e.g., 7\n U. S. C. \u00a71301(b)(8)(B). By contrast, as the Bankruptcy Code shows,\n Congress can make its mandate of simple multiplication unambigu\n ous\u2014commonly using the term \u201cmultiplied.\u201d See, e.g., 11 U. S. C.\n \u00a71325(b)(3). Third, under pre-BAPCPA case law, the general rule\n was that courts would multiply a debtor\u2019s current monthly income by\n the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in\n determining projected disposable income, but would also have discre\n tion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor\u2019s\n income. This is significant, since the Court \u201cwill not read the Bank\n ruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indica\n tion that Congress intended such a departure,\u201d Travelers Casualty &\n                   Cite as: 560 U.

Pp. 6\u201310.\n   (b) The mechanical approach also clashes with \u00a71325\u2019s terms.\nFirst, \u00a71325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s reference to projected disposable income \u201cto be\nreceived in the applicable commitment period\u201d strongly favors the\nforward-looking approach. Because respondent would have far less\nthan $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, pe\ntitioner\u2019s projection does not accurately reflect disposable income \u201cto\nbe received.\u201d In such circumstances, the mechanical approach effec\ntively reads that phrase out of the statute. Second, \u00a71325(b)(1)\u2019s di\nrection to courts to determine projected disposable income \u201cas of the\neffective date of the plan,\u201d\u2014 i.e., the confirmation date\u2014is more con\nsistent with the view that they are to consider postfiling information\nabout a debtor\u2019s financial situation. Had Congress intended for pro\njected disposable income to be no more than a multiple of disposable\nincome, it could have specified the plan\u2019s filing date as the effective\ndate. Third, \u00a71325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s requirement that projected disposable\nincome \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d is rendered a hollow\ncommand if, as of the plan\u2019s effective date, the debtor lacks the\nmeans to pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts. Pp. 11\u2013\n12.\n   (c) The arguments supporting the mechanical approach are unper\nsuasive. The claim that the Code\u2019s detailed and precise \u201cdisposable\nincome\u201d definition would have no purpose without the mechanical\napproach overlooks the important role that this statutory formula\nplays under the forward-looking approach, which begins with a dis\nposable income calculation. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s rebuttable \u201cpre\nsumption\u201d analysis simply heeds the ordinary meaning of \u201cprojected.\u201d\nThis Court rejects petitioner\u2019s argument that only the mechanical\napproach is consistent with \u00a71129(a)(15)(B), which refers to \u201cpro\njected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).\u201d And the Court declines to infer from the fact that\n\u00a71325(b)(3) incorporates \u00a7707\u2014which allows courts to consider \u201cspe\ncial circumstances,\u201d but only with respect to calculating expenses\u2014\nthat Congress intended to eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that\ncourts previously exercised to account for known or virtually certain\nchanges.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a7101(30),\n109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must\nliquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors,\nsee \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to\nkeep their property, but they must agree to a court\u00ad\napproved plan under which they pay creditors out of their\nfuture income, see \u00a7\u00a71306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A\nbankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a\nChapter 13 debtor\u2019s plan. \u00a71322(a)(1); see also 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7586(a)(3).\n   Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under\nwhich a bankruptcy court \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay not\u201d confirm a\nplan. \u00a71325(a),(b). If an unsecured creditor or the bank\u00ad\nruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, \u00a71325(b)(1) requires\nthe debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to\npay all \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to be received by the\ndebtor over the duration of the plan.\n2                  HAMILTON v.

S. C. \u00a71325(b)(1); see also\n\u00a71325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of\n2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code)\nloosely defined \u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201cincome which is\nreceived by the debtor and which is not reasonably neces\u00ad\nsary to be expended\u201d for the \u201cmaintenance or support of\nthe debtor,\u201d for qualifying charitable contributions, or for\nbusiness expenditures. \u00a71325(b)(2)(A), (B).\n   The Code did not define the term \u201cprojected disposable\nincome,\u201d and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a\nmechanical approach in calculating projected disposable\nincome. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by\nthe number of months in the plan and then determined\nwhat portion of the result was \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cdisposable.\u201d\nSee 2 K.

See \u00a7101(10A)(A)(i).1      The phrase\n\u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d in\n\u00a71325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose\nincome is below the median for his or her State, the\nphrase includes the full amount needed for \u201cmaintenance\nor support,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with\nincome that exceeds the state median, only certain speci\u00ad\nfied expenses are included,2 see \u00a7\u00a7707(b)(2), 1325(b)(3)(A).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 However,  if a debtor does not file the required schedule (Schedule I),\nthe bankruptcy court may select a different 6-month period.

In the six months before her filing, she received a\none-time buyout from her former employer, and this pay\u00ad\nment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to\n$11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84,\n107. As a result of these payments, respondent\u2019s current\nmonthly income, as averaged from April through October\n2006, was $5,343.70\u2014a figure that exceeds the median\nincome for a family of one in Kansas. See id., at 78. Re\u00ad\nspondent\u2019s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to\n\u00a7707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a\nmonthly \u201cdisposable income\u201d of $1,114.98 on Form 22C.\nIbid.\n   On the form used for reporting monthly income (Sched\u00ad\nule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per\nmonth\u2014which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see\nalso id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly\nexpenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly ex\u00ad\npenses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule\nJ figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly\ndisposable income of $149.03.\n   Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to\npay $144 per month for 36 months. See id., at 93. Peti\u00ad\ntioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirma\u00ad\ntion of the plan because the amount respondent proposed\nto pay was less than the full amount of the claims against\nher, see \u00a71325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner\u2019s view,\nrespondent was not committing all of her \u201cprojected dis\u00ad\nposable income\u201d to the repayment of creditors, see\n\u00a71325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to\ncalculate projected disposable income was simply to mul\u00ad\ntiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the\nnumber of months in the commitment period.

Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view\nthat the word \u201cprojected\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B) requires courts\n\u201cto consider at confirmation the debtor\u2019s actual income as\nit was reported on Schedule I.\u201d Id., at *5 (emphasis\nadded). This conclusion was warranted by the text of\n\u00a71325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was\nnecessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bank\u00ad\nruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating fi\u00ad\nnances in the six months before filing. Ibid.\n   Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel, which affirmed. 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007).\nThe Panel noted that, although Congress redefined \u201cdis\u00ad\nposable income\u201d in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre\u00ad\nexisting term \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d Id., at 24.\nThus, the Panel concluded, there was no reason to believe\nthat Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice\nunder which bankruptcy courts determined projected\ndisposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but\nconsidered other evidence when there was reason to be\u00ad\nlieve that the schedules did not reflect a debtor\u2019s actual\nability to pay. Ibid.\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed. 545 F. 3d 1269, 1270\n(2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calcu\u00ad\nlating \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d should begin with the\n\u201cpresumption\u201d that the figure yielded by the mechanical\n6                 HAMILTON v.

Id., at 1278\u20131279.\n   This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558\nU. S. ___ (2009).\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n   The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of\n\u00a71325\u2019s reference to \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d Peti\u00ad\ntioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that\n\u201cprojected disposable income\u201d means past average monthly\ndisposable income multiplied by the number of months in\na debtor\u2019s plan. Respondent, who favors the forward\u00ad\nlooking approach, agrees that the method outlined by\npetitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she\nargues that in exceptional cases, where significant\nchanges in a debtor\u2019s financial circumstances are known or\nvirtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to\nmake an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the\nstronger argument.\n   First, respondent\u2019s argument is supported by the ordi\u00ad\nnary meaning of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d \u201cWhen terms used\nin a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary\nmeaning.\u201d Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179,\n187 (1995). Here, the term \u201cprojected\u201d is not defined, and\nin ordinary usage future occurrences are not \u201cprojected\u201d\nbased on the assumption that the past will necessarily\nrepeat itself. For example, projections concerning a com\u00ad\npany\u2019s future sales or the future cash flow from a license\ntake into account anticipated events that may change past\ntrends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,\nLtd., 551 U. S. 308, 316 (2007) (describing adjustments to\n\u201cprojected sales\u201d in light of falling demand); Innovair\nAviation, Ltd. v.

On the night of an election,\nexperts do not \u201cproject\u201d the percentage of the votes that a\ncandidate will receive by simply assuming that the candi\u00ad\ndate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the\nfirst few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not\nproject that a team\u2019s winning percentage at the end of a\nnew season will be the same as the team\u2019s winning per\u00ad\ncentage last year or the team\u2019s winning percentage at the\nend of the first month of competition. While a projection\ntakes past events into account, adjustments are often\nmade based on other factors that may affect the final\noutcome. See In re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy.\nApp. Panel CA1 2007) (contrasting \u201cmultiplied,\u201d which\n\u201crequires only mathematical acumen,\u201d with \u201cprojected,\u201d\nwhich requires \u201cmathematic acumen adjusted by delibera\u00ad\ntion and discretion\u201d).\n   Second, the word \u201cprojected\u201d appears in many federal\nstatutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple\nmultiplication.

C. \u00a71325(b)(3) (\u201ccurrent monthly income, when mul\u00ad\ntiplied by 12\u201d); \u00a7\u00a7704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same);\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (\u201cmultiplied by 60\u201d).

S. C. \u00a7403(f)(3) (\u201cmulti\u00ad\nplied by the number of months in such year\u201d).\n   Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the\n\u201cforward-looking\u201d approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the gen\u00ad\neral rule was that courts would multiply a debtor\u2019s current\nmonthly income by the number of months in the commit\u00ad\nment period as the first step in determining projected\ndisposable income. See, e.g., In re Killough, 900 F. 2d 61,\n62\u201363 (CA5 1990) (per curiam); In re Anderson, 21 F. 3d\n355, 357 (CA9 1994); In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128, 1132\n(CA4 1995).

But\ncourts also had discretion to account for known or virtu\u00ad\nally certain changes in the debtor\u2019s income. See Heath,\n182 B. R., at 559\u2013561; Richardson, 283 B.

In In re Solomon, 67 F. 3d 1128 (1995), for example, the\nFourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment because it deemed\ndisbursements from an individual retirement account during the plan\nperiod to be \u201cspeculative\u201d and \u201chypothetical.\u201d Id., at 1132. There is no\nreason to assume that the result would have been the same if future\ndisbursements had been more assured. That was certainly true of In re\nKillough, 900 F. 2d 61 (1990), in which the Fifth Circuit declined to\nrequire inclusion of overtime pay in projected disposable income be\u00ad\ncause it \u201cwas not definite enough.\u201d Id., at 65; see also id., at 66\n(\u201c[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working\novertime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor\u2019s pro\u00ad\njected disposable income\u201d).

Indeed, petitioner\nconcedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to\nBAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.\n   Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we\n\u201c \u2018will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bank\u00ad\nruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress\nintended such a departure.\u2019 \u201d Travelers Casualty & Surety\nCo. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U. S. 443,\n454 (2007); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U. S. 526,\n539 (2004); Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U. S. 213, 221 (1998);\nsee also Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); Kelly\nv. Robinson, 479 U. S. 36, 47 (1986). Congress did not\namend the term \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d in 2005,\nand pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely\nacknowledged and well-documented view that courts may\ntake into account known or virtually certain changes to\ndebtors\u2019 income or expenses when projecting disposable\nincome. In light of this historical practice, we would ex\u00ad\npect that, had Congress intended for \u201cprojected\u201d to carry a\nspecialized\u2014and indeed, unusual\u2014meaning in Chapter\n13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., e.g., 26\nU. S. C. \u00a7279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining \u201cprojected\nearnings\u201d as reflecting a 3-year historical average).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

C. \u00a71325.\n   First, \u00a71325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s reference to projected disposable\nincome \u201cto be received in the applicable commitment\nperiod\u201d strongly favors the forward-looking approach.\nThere is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive\nfar less than $756 per month in disposable income during\nthe plan period, so petitioner\u2019s projection does not accu\u00ad\nrately reflect \u201cincome to be received\u201d during that period.\nSee In re Nowlin, 576 F. 3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The\nmechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of\nthe statute when a debtor\u2019s current disposable income is\nsubstantially higher than the income that the debtor\npredictably will receive during the plan period. See\nKawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (\u201c[W]e are\nhesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional\nenactment which renders superfluous another portion of\nthat same law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   Second, \u00a71325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected\ndisposable income \u201cas of the effective date of the plan,\u201d\nwhich is the date on which the plan is confirmed and\nbecomes binding, see \u00a71327(a). Had Congress intended for\nprojected disposable income to be nothing more than a\nmultiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no rea\u00ad\nson why Congress would not have required courts to de\u00ad\ntermine that value as of the filing date of the plan. See\nFed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be\nfiled within 14 days of the filing of a petition), online at\nhttp://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/FederalRulema\nking/Overview/BankruptcyRules.aspx (all Internet mate\u00ad\nrials as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file). In the very next section of the Code, for\nexample, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence\npayments \u201cnot later than 30 days after the date of the\nfiling of the plan.\u201d \u00a71326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Con\u00ad\n12                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019 decision to require courts to measure projected\ndisposable income \u201cas of the effective date of the plan\u201d is\nmore consistent with the view that Congress expected\ncourts to consider postfiling information about the debtor\u2019s\nfinancial circumstances.        See 545 F. 3d, at 1279\n(\u201c[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all\nprojected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured\ncreditors \u2018as of the effective date of the plan\u2019 suggests\nconsideration of the debtor\u2019s actual financial circum\u00ad\nstances as of the effective date of the plan\u201d).\n   Third, the requirement that projected disposable income\n\u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d is most naturally read\nto contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors\nin the calculated monthly amounts. \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). But\nwhen, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks\nthe means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow\ncommand.\n                             C\n   The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical\napproach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now\nprovides a detailed and precise definition of \u201cdisposable\nincome,\u201d proponents of the mechanical approach maintain\nthat any departure from this method leaves that definition\n\u201c \u2018with no apparent purpose.\u2019 \u201d In re Kagenveama, 541 F.\n3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the\nimportant role that the statutory formula for calculating\n\u201cdisposable income\u201d plays under the forward-looking\napproach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a\ncourt taking the forward-looking approach should begin by\ncalculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing\nmore is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court\nmay go further and take into account other known or\nvirtually certain information about the debtor\u2019s future\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nincome or expenses.5\n  Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a\nrebuttable \u201cpresumption\u201d that the figure produced by the\nmechanical approach accurately represents a debtor\u2019s\n\u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d See 545 F. 3d, at 1278\u2013\n1279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference\nto any such presumption but that related Code provisions\nexpressly create other rebuttable presumptions.         See\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the\nTenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the\nCode.\n  The Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, however, simply heeds the\nordinary meaning of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d As noted, a\nperson making a projection uses past occurrences as a\nstarting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Cir\u00ad\ncuit prescribed. See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.\n  Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is\nconsistent with \u00a71129(a)(15)(B), which refers to \u201cprojected\ndisposable income of the debtor (as defined in section\n1325(b)(2)).\u201d    This cross-reference, petitioner argues,\nshows that Congress intended for the term \u201cprojected\ndisposable income\u201d to incorporate, presumably in all con\u00ad\ntexts, the defined term \u201cdisposable income.\u201d It is evident\nthat \u00a71129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term \u201cdis-\nposable income,\u201d see \u00a71325(b)(2), but that fact offers\nno insight into the meaning of the word \u201cprojected\u201d\nin \u00a7\u00a71129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see\nhow that word acquires a specialized meaning as a\nresult of this cross-reference\u2014particularly where both\n\u00a7\u00a71129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected dis\u00ad\nposable income \u201cto be received\u201d during the relevant period.\nSee supra, at 11.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 For the same reason, the phrase \u201c[f]or purposes of this subsection\u201d\n\nin \u00a71325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking\napproach.\n14                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioner also notes that \u00a7707 allows courts to take\n\u201cspecial circumstances\u201d into consideration, but that\n\u00a71325(b)(3) incorporates \u00a7707 only with respect to calcu\u00ad\nlating expenses. See In re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314\u2013315\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a \u201cspecial\ncircumstances\u201d exception should not be inferred with\nrespect to the debtor\u2019s income. We decline to infer from\n\u00a71325\u2019s incorporation of \u00a7707 that Congress intended to\neliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previ\u00ad\nously exercised when projecting disposable income to\naccount for known or virtually certain changes. Accord,\nIn re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct.\nNJ 2008).\n                            D\n   In cases in which a debtor\u2019s disposable income during\nthe 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower\nor higher than the debtor\u2019s disposable income during the\nplan period, the mechanical approach would produce\nsenseless results that we do not think Congress intended.\nIn cases in which the debtor\u2019s disposable income is higher\nduring the plan period, the mechanical approach would\ndeny creditors payments that the debtor could easily\nmake. And where, as in the present case, the debtor\u2019s\ndisposable income during the plan period is substantially\nlower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection\nof Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter\u2019s main\neligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is\nan \u201cindividual whose income is sufficiently stable and\nregular\u201d to allow her \u201cto make payments under a plan,\u201d\n\u00a7101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in\n\u00a7109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she\ncould not file a confirmable plan. Under \u00a71325(a)(6), a\nplan cannot be confirmed unless \u201cthe debtor will be able to\nmake all payments under the plan and comply with the\nplan.\u201d And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npossibly make the payments that the mechanical approach\nprescribes.\n  In order to avoid or at least to mitigate the harsh results\nthat the mechanical approach may produce for debtors,\npetitioner advances several possible escape strategies. He\nproposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by\nthe mechanical approach, and in any event none of the\nmaneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.\n                               1\n   Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a\npetition so as to place any extraordinary income outside\nthe 6-month look-back period. We see at least two prob\u00ad\nlems with this proposal.\n   First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor\nsliding into bankruptcy.\n      \u201cPotential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a law\u00ad\n    yer\u2019s office when they are one step from financial\n    Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the\n    debtor\u2019s home the next day; the debtor\u2019s only car\n    was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last\n    night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor\u2019s\n    take-home pay below the ordinary requirements\n    of food and rent.       Instantaneous relief is ex-\n    pected, if not necessary.\u201d K. Lundin & W.

See 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(a)(7) (requiring,\nas a condition of confirmation, that \u201cthe action of the\ndebtor in filing the petition was in good faith\u201d); see also,\n16                     HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ne.g., In re Myers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007) (citing\n\u201c \u2018the timing of the petition\u2019 \u201d as a factor to be considered in\nassessing a debtor\u2019s compliance with the good-faith re\u00ad\nquirement). Accord, Neufeld v. Freeman, 794 F. 2d 149,\n153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor\u2019s prepetition conduct may inform\nthe court\u2019s good-faith inquiry).\n                             2\n  Petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually\nhigh income during the 6 months prior to the filing of a\npetition, could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of\ncurrent income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy\ncourt to exercise its authority under \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii) to\nselect a 6-month period that is more representative of the\ndebtor\u2019s future disposable income. We see little merit in\nthis convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of\nthe mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would\nimproperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as\nwe believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence\nto the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is\nnot needed. In any event, even if this strategy were al\u00ad\nlowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable\nincome during the plan period is sharply lower than their\nprevious disposable income.6\n                             3\n   Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the peti\u00ad\ntion and refile at a later, more favorable date.

C. \u00a7521(i)(3), a debtor seeking additional time to file\na schedule of income must submit the request within 45 days after\nfiling the petition, and the court may not grant an extension of more\nthan 45 days.\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

In respondent\u2019s\ncase, a presumption of abuse would attach under\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, \u201cmultiplied\nby 60,\u201d exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and\n(II).

S. C. \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). The Code provides a formula for\n\u201cproject[ing]\u201d what a debtor\u2019s \u201cdisposable income\u201d will be,\nwhich so far as his earnings are concerned turns only on\nhis past income. The Court concludes that this formula\nshould not apply in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d where \u201cknown or\nvirtually certain\u201d changes in the debtor\u2019s circumstances\nmake it a poor predictor.

The Code does not define \u201cprojected dis\nposable income,\u201d but it does define \u201cdisposable income.\u201d\nThe next paragraph of \u00a71325(b) provides that \u201c[f]or pur\nposes of this subsection, the term \u2018disposable income\u2019\nmeans current monthly income received by the debtor,\u201d\nexcluding certain payments received for child support,\n\u201cless amounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d on\nthree categories of expenses. \u00a71325(b)(2). The Code in\nturn defines \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d as \u201cthe average\nmonthly income from all sources that the debtor re\nceives . . . derived during the 6-month period ending on\u201d\none of two dates.1 \u00a7101(10A)(A). Whichever date applies,\na debtor\u2019s \u201ccurrent monthly income,\u201d and thus the income\ncomponent of his \u201cdisposable income,\u201d is a sum certain, a\nrate fixed once for all based on historical figures.\n   This definition of \u201cdisposable income\u201d applies to the use\nof that term in the longer phrase \u201cprojected disposable\nincome\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B), since the definition says that it\napplies to subsection (b). Cf. \u00a71129(a)(15)(B) (referring to\n\u201cthe projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined\nin section 1325(b)(2))\u201d). The puzzle is what to make of the\nword \u201cprojected.\u201d\n   In the Court\u2019s view, this modifier makes all the differ\nence. Projections, it explains, ordinarily account for later\ndevelopments, not just past data. Ante, at 6\u20137. Thus, the\nCourt concludes, in determining \u201cprojected disposable\nincome\u201d a bankruptcy court may depart from \u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 If\n      the debtor files a schedule of current income, as ordinarily re\nquired by \u00a7521(a)(1)(B)(ii), then the 6-month period ends on the last\nday of the month preceding the date the case is commenced,\n\u00a7101(10A)(A)(i)\u2014that is, when the petition is filed, \u00a7\u00a7301(a), 302(a),\n303(b). If the debtor does not file such a schedule on time\u2014which the\nbankruptcy court apparently may excuse him from doing,\n\u00a7521(a)(1)(B)(ii)\u2014the 6-month period ends on the date the bankruptcy\ncourt determines the debtor\u2019s current income. \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Ante, at 6.\n   That interpretation runs aground because it either\nrenders superfluous text Congress included or requires\nadding text Congress did not. It would be pointless to\ndefine disposable income in such detail, based on data\nduring a specific 6-month period, if a court were free to set\nthe resulting figure aside whenever it appears to be a poor\npredictor. And since \u201cdisposable income\u201d appears nowhere\nelse in \u00a71325(b), then unless \u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s definition ap\nplies to \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B), it\ndoes not apply at all.\n   The Court insists its interpretation does not render\n\u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s incorporation of \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d a\nnullity: A bankruptcy court must still begin with that\nfigure, but is simply free to fiddle with it if a \u201csignificant\u201d\nchange in the debtor\u2019s circumstances is \u201cknown or virtu\nally certain.\u201d Ante, at 6, 12. That construction conven\niently avoids superfluity, but only by utterly abandoning\nthe text the Court purports to construe. Nothing in the\ntext supports treating the definition of disposable income\nCongress supplied as a suggestion. And even if the word\n\u201cprojected\u201d did allow (or direct) a court to disregard\n\u00a71325(b)(2)\u2019s fixed formula and to consider other data,\nthere would be no basis in the text for the restrictions the\nCourt reads in, regarding when and to what extent a court\nmay (or must) do so. If the statute authorizes estimations,\nit authorizes them in every case, not just those where\nchanges to the debtor\u2019s income are both \u201csignificant\u201d and\neither \u201cknown or virtually certain.\u201d Ibid. If the evidence\nindicates it is merely more likely than not that the\ndebtor\u2019s income will increase by some minimal amount,\nthere is no reading of the word \u201cprojected\u201d that permits (or\nrequires) a court to ignore that change. The Court, in\nshort, can arrive at its compromise construction only by\n4                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nrewriting the statute.\n                              B\n   The only reasonable reading that avoids deleting words\nCongress enacted, or adding others it did not, is this:\nSetting aside expenses excludable under \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)\nand (B), which are not at issue here, a court must calcu\nlate the debtor\u2019s \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d by multi\nplying his current monthly income by the number of\nmonths in the \u201capplicable commitment period.\u201d The word\n\u201cprojected\u201d in this context, I agree, most sensibly refers to\na calculation, prediction, or estimation of future events,\nsee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12\u201313 (col\nlecting dictionary definitions); see also Webster\u2019s New\nInternational Dictionary 1978 (2d ed. 1957). But one\nassuredly can calculate, predict, or estimate future figures\nbased on the past. And here Congress has commanded\nthat a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the\nprojection.\n   The Court rejects this reading as unrealistic. A projec\ntion, the Court explains, may be based in part on past\ndata, but \u201cadjustments are often made based on other\nfactors that may affect the final outcome.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. No\ngambler would bet the farm using \u201cproject[ions]\u201d that are\nbased only on a football team\u2019s play before its star quar\nterback was injured. And no pundit would keep his post if\nhe \u201cprojected\u201d election results relying only on prior cycles,\nignoring recent polls. So too, the Court appears to reason,\nit makes no sense to say a court \u201cproject[s]\u201d a debtor\u2019s\n\u201cdisposable income\u201d when it considers only what he earned\nin a specific 6-month period in the past.

One who is asked to predict future results, but\nis armed with no other information than prior perform\nance, can still make a projection; it may simply be off the\nmark. Congress, of course, could have tried to prevent\nthat possibility by prescribing, as it has done in other\ncontexts, that a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income be\ndetermined based on the \u201cbest available evidence,\u201d 8\nU. S. C. \u00a71364(c)(2), or \u201cany . . . relevant information,\u201d 25\nU. S. C. \u00a72009(c)(1). But it included no such prescription\nhere, and instead identified the data a court should con\nsider. Perhaps Congress concluded that other information\na bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too\neasily manipulated. Or perhaps it thought the cost of\nconsidering such information outweighed the benefits. Cf.\n7 U. S. C. \u00a71301(b)(13)(J)\u2013(M) (requiring national and\nlocal \u201cprojected\u201d yields of various crops to be adjusted only\nfor abnormal weather, trends in yields, and production\npractices, apparently to the exclusion of other presumably\nrelevant variables such as a sudden increase or decrease\nin the number of producers, farm subsidies, etc.). In all\nevents, neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the\nprojection method Congress chose has any bearing on\nwhat the statute means.\n   The Court contends that if Congress really meant courts\nto multiply a static figure by a set number of months, it\nwould have used the word \u201cmultiplied,\u201d as it has done\nelsewhere\u2014indeed, elsewhere in the same subsection, see,\ne.g., 11 U. S. C. \u00a71325(b)(3)\u2014instead of the word \u201cpro\njected.\u201d2 Ante, at 8. I do not dispute that, as a general\nmatter, we should presume that Congress does not ordi\nnarily use two words in the same context to denote the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Of course, since the number of months in the commitment period\n\nmay vary, Congress could not simply have substituted a single word,\nbut would have had to write \u201cdisposable income multiplied by the\nnumber of months in the applicable commitment period\u201d or some such\nphrase.\n6                      HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsame thing. But if forced to choose between (A) assuming\nCongress enacted text that serves no purpose at all, (B)\nascribing an unheard-of meaning to the word \u201cprojected\u201d\n(loaded with made-to-order restrictions) simply to avoid\nundesirable results, or (C) assuming Congress employed\nsynonyms to express a single idea, the last is obviously the\nleast evil.\n   In any event, we are not put to that choice here. While\nunder my reading a court must determine the income half\nof the \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d equation by multiply\ning a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the\nexpenses excludable under \u00a71325(b)(2)(A) and (B). Unlike\nthe debtor\u2019s current monthly income, none of the three\ntypes of expenses\u2014payments for the support of the debtor\nand his dependents, charitable contributions, and ex\npenses to keep an existing business above water\u2014is ex\nplicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for\ndebtors with incomes below the state median). The first of\nthose cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based\non the same 6-month period from which current monthly\nincome is derived,3 and the texts of the other two are\nconsistent with determining expenses based on expecta\ntions. See \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(ii) (charitable expenses to quali\nfied entities limited to \u201c15 percent of gross income of the\ndebtor for the year in which the contributions are made\u201d);\n\u00a71325(b)(2)(B) (\u201cexpenditures necessary for the continua\ntion, preservation, and operation\u201d of a business in which\nthe debtor is engaged).\n   In short, a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income consists\nof two parts: one (current monthly income) that is fixed\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For a debtor whose income is below the state median, excludable\n\nexpenses include domestic-support obligations \u201cthat first becom[e]\npayable after the date the petition is filed,\u201d \u00a71325(b)(2)(A)(i)\u2014that is,\nafter the six-month window relevant to the debtor\u2019s current monthly\nincome has closed (unless the debtor does not file a current-income\nschedule), see \u00a7101(10A)(A)(i).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The\nstatute thus requires the court to predict the difference\nbetween two figures, each of which depends on the dura\ntion of the commitment period, and one of which also turns\npartly on facts besides historical data. In light of all this,\nit seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process\nas projection, not merely multiplication.\n                              C\n   The Court\u2019s remaining arguments about the statute\u2019s\nmeaning are easily dispatched. A \u201cmechanical\u201d reading of\nprojected disposable income, it contends, renders superflu\nous the phrase \u201cto be received in the applicable commit\nment period\u201d in \u00a71325(b)(1)(B). Ante, at 11. Not at all.\nThat phrase defines the period for which a debtor\u2019s dis\nposable income must be calculated (i.e., the period over\nwhich the projection extends), and thus the amount the\ndebtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.\n   Similarly insubstantial is the Court\u2019s claim regarding\nthe requirement that the plan provide that the debtor\u2019s\nprojected disposable income \u201cwill be applied to make\npayments\u201d      toward     unsecured    creditors\u2019    claims,\n\u00a71325(b)(1)(B). The Court says this requirement makes no\nsense unless the debtor is actually able to pay an amount\nequal to his projected disposable income. Ante, at 12. But\nit makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is\nentitled to confirmation in the first place; and that as\nsumption is wrong. The requirement that the debtor pay\nat least his projected disposable income is a prerequisite to\nconfirmation. The \u201cwill be applied\u201d proviso does not re\nquire a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds\nChapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.\n   The Court also argues that \u00a71325(b)(1)\u2019s directive to\ndetermine projected disposable income \u201cas of the effective\n8                  HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndate of the plan\u201d makes no sense if mere multiplication of\nexisting numbers is required. Ante, at 11\u201312. As I have\nexplained, however, \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d may in\nsome cases require more than multiplication (as to ex\npenses), and the estimations involved may vary from the\ndate of the plan\u2019s filing until the date it takes effect.\nMoreover, the provision also applies to the alternative\navenue to confirmation in \u00a71325(b)(1)(A), which requires\nthat \u201cthe value of the property to be distributed under the\nplan\u201d to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the credi\ntor\u2019s claim. As to that requirement, the effective-date\nrequirement makes perfect sense.\n   Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice\nprior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer\nProtection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns\nwith the atextual approach the Court adopts today. Ante,\nat 8\u201310. That is unsurprising, since the prior version of\nthe relevant provisions was completely consistent with\nthat approach. The Court is correct that BAPCPA \u201cdid not\namend the term \u2018projected disposable income,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 10.\nBut it did amend the definition of that term. Before 2005,\n\u00a71325(b)(2) defined \u201cdisposable income\u201d simply as \u201cincome\nwhich is received by the debtor and which is not reasona\nbly necessary to be expended\u201d on the same basic types of\nexpenses excluded by the current statute. \u00a71325(b)(2)\n(2000 ed.). Nothing in that terse definition compelled a\ncourt to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6\nmonth period. But in BAPCPA\u2014the same Act in which\nCongress defined \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d in\n\u00a7101(10A)(A)\u2014Congress redefined \u201cdisposable income\u201d in\n\u00a71325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking defini\ntion. See Pub. L. 109\u20138, \u00a7102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32\u201334.\nGiven these significant changes, the fact that the Court\u2019s\napproach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only\ndoes not recommend it, see e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of\nPublic Welfare v.

For even\nassuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know\nwhich results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoid\ning) apart from the only congressional expression of its\nthoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrele\nvant to what the statute means.\n  In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as\ninevitable nor as \u201csenseless\u201d as the Court portrays. The\nCourt\u2019s first concern is that if actual or anticipated\nchanges in the debtor\u2019s earnings are ignored, then a debtor\nwhose income increases after the critical 6-month window\nwill not be required to pay all he can afford. Ante, at 14.\nBut as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22\u201323,\nChapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the re\nquest of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan \u201c[a]t any\ntime after confirmation\u201d to \u201cincrease . . . the amount of\npayments\u201d on a class of claims or \u201creduce the time for such\npayments.\u201d \u00a71329(a)(1)\u2013(2) (2006 ed.). The Court offers\nno explanation of why modification would not be available\nin such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.\n  The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor\nwhose income suddenly declines after the 6-month window\nor who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during\nthat window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief be\ncause he will be unable to devote his \u201cdisposable income\u201d\n(which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unse\ncured creditors going forward. Ante, at 14\u201315. At least for\n10                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ndebtors whose circumstances deteriorate after confirma\ntion, however, the Code already provides an answer. Just\nas a creditor can request an upward modification in light\nof postconfirmation developments, so too can a debtor ask\nfor a downward adjustment. \u00a71329(a). Cf. \u00a71329(b)(1)\n(requiring that modifications meet requirements of\n\u00a7\u00a71322(a)\u2013(b), 1323(c), and 1325(a), but not \u00a71325(b)).\n   Moreover, even apart from the availability of modifica\ntion it requires little imagination to see why Congress\nmight want to withhold relief from debtors whose situa\ntions have suddenly deteriorated (after or even toward the\nend of the 6-month window), or who in the midst of dire\nstraits have been blessed (within the 6-month window) by\nan influx of unusually high income. Bankruptcy protec\ntion is not a birthright, and Congress could reasonably\nconclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet\nneed a reprieve from repaying their debts; perhaps they\nwill recover. And perhaps the debtor who has received a\none-time bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat.\nHow long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is\ninherently a policy choice. Congress confined the calcula\ntion of current monthly income to a 6-month period (ordi\nnarily ending before the case is commenced), but it could\nhave picked 2 or 12 months (or a different end date) in\nstead. Whatever the wisdom of the window it chose, we\nshould not assume it did not know what it was doing and\naccordingly refuse to give effect to its words.\n   Even if one insists on making provision for such debtors,\nthe Court is wrong to write off four alternative strategies\nthe trustee suggests, Brief for Petitioner 50\u201354:\n   \u25cf Presumably some debtors whose income has only\nrecently been reduced, or who have just received a jolt that\ncauses a temporary uptick in their average income, can\ndelay filing a Chapter 13 petition until their \u201ccurrent\nmonthly income\u201d catches up with their present circum\nstances. The Court speculates that delay might \u201cgiv[e] the\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nappearance of bad faith,\u201d ante, at 15 (citing \u00a71325(a)(7)),\nbut it offers no explanation of why that is so, and no au\nthority supporting it.4\n   \u25cf Even if bad faith were a real worry, or if it were essen\ntial to a debtor\u2019s prospects that he invoke \u00a7362\u2019s automatic\nstay immediately, the debtor might ask the bankruptcy\ncourt to excuse him from filing a statement of current\nincome, so that it determines his \u201ccurrently monthly in\ncome\u201d at a later date. See \u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii). The Court\ndismisses this alternative, explaining that if the Code\nrequires a mechanical approach this solution would \u201cim\nproperly undermine\u201d it, and if the Code allows exceptions\nfor changed circumstances the solution is unnecessary.\nAnte, at 16. The second premise is correct, but the first is\nnot. Congress does not pursue its purposes at all costs.\nRodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987)\n(per curiam). Here it may have struck the very balance\nthe Court thinks critical by creating a fixed formula but\nleaving leeway as to the time to which it applies.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Neither of the two Court of Appeals cases the Court cites\u2014In re\n\nMyers, 491 F. 3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007), and Neufeld v. Freeman, 794\nF. 2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986)\u2014involved a debtor\u2019s delaying his petition\nuntil his circumstances would permit the court to confirm a repayment\nplan.\n  5 The Court observes that not every debtor will benefit from this ex\n\nception, ante, at 16, and n. 6, since \u00a7521(i)(3) provides that a bank\nruptcy court may not grant a request (which may be made after the\ndeadline for filing the current-income schedule) for an extension of\nmore than 45 days to file such a schedule. But the statute appears to\nassume that a court may excuse the filing of such a schedule altogether:\nA debtor is required to file a schedule in the first instance \u201cunless the\ncourt orders otherwise,\u201d \u00a7521(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).             And\n\u00a7101(10A)(A)(ii)\u2019s provision of a method for calculating current monthly\nincome \u201cif the debtor does not file the schedule of current income\nrequired by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)\u201d makes little sense unless a court\ncan excuse the failure to do so, since an unexcused failure to do so\nwould be a basis for dismissing the case, see \u00a7521(i). Allowing courts to\nexcuse such schedules does not render superfluous \u00a7521(i)(3)\u2019s authori\n12                     HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   \u25cf A debtor who learns after filing that he will be unable\nto repay his full projected disposable income might also be\nable to dismiss his case and refile it later. \u00a71307(b). The\nCourt worries that this alternative also might be deemed\nabusive, again with no pertinent authority for the specula\ntion.6 Its concern is based primarily on its belief that this\n\u201ccircumvents the statutory limits on a court\u2019s ability to\nshift the look-back period.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317. That belief is\nmistaken, both because the Court exaggerates the statu\ntory limitations on adjusting the look-back period, and\nbecause, just as it does not defeat the disposable-income\nformula\u2019s rigidity to allow adjustments regarding the time\nof determining that figure, it would not undermine the\nlimitations on adjustment applicable in a pending case to\nallow the debtor to dismiss and refile.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nzation for limited extensions, since that applies to extensions sought up\nto 45 days after the filing deadline, whereas \u00a7521(a)(1)(B) seems to\napply only before the deadline.\n   6 The sole authority the Court supplies\u2014a single Bankruptcy Court\n\ndecision predating BAPCPA\u2014provides no support. See In re Glenn,\n288 B. R. 516, 519\u2013521 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002). Although ac\nknowledging that \u201c[m]ultiple filings by a debtor are not, in and of\nthemselves, improper,\u201d the court did note that \u201cwhether this is the first\nor subsequent filin[g]\u201d by the debtor is one among the \u201ctotality of the\ncircumstances\u201d to be considered in a good-faith analysis. Id., at 520\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The debtor in the case at hand had\nfiled three previous Chapter 13 petitions, \u201ceach on the eve of a sched\nuled foreclosure,\u201d and according to the court \u201cnever had any intention of\nfollowing through with any of the Chapter 13 cases,\u201d but had used the\nbankruptcy process \u201cto hold [his creditor] hostage, while remaining in\nhis residence without paying for it.\u201d Id., at 520\u2013521.\n   7 The Court also notes that the Code precludes a debtor who has had\n\na case pending in the last 180 days from refiling if his prior case was\ndismissed because he willfully failed to obey the court\u2019s orders or to\nappear before the court, \u00a7109(g)(1), or if he voluntarily dismissed the\nprior suit \u201cfollowing the filing of a request for relief from the automatic\nstay\u201d under \u00a7362, \u00a7109(g)(2). Ante, at 17, n. 7. But the Court does not\nexplain why these barriers have any bearing on whether refiling for\nbankruptcy would be abusive when the barriers do not apply.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            13\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n   \u25cf A debtor unable to pursue any of these avenues to\nChapter 13 might still seek relief under Chapter 7. The\nCourt declares this cold comfort, noting that some debt\nors\u2014including Lanning\u2014will have incomes too high to\nqualify for Chapter 7. Ante, at 17\u201318. Some such debtors,\nhowever, may be able to show \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d\n\u00a7707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7. Aside\nfrom noting the absence of authority on the issue, the\nCourt\u2019s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the\nspecial-circumstances exception is available only if the\ndebtor has \u201cno reasonable alternative,\u201d \u00a7707(b)(2)(B)(i),\nwhich will not be true after today given the Court\u2019s hold\ning that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a\ndebtor\u2019s income. As for those who cannot establish special\ncircumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause\nfor concern. Congress has evidently concluded that such\ndebtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and\nthat they are not suitable candidates for repaying their\ndebts (at least in part) under Chapter 13\u2019s protective\numbrella. We have neither reason nor warrant to second\nguess either determination.\n                         *     *     *\n  Underlying the Court\u2019s interpretation is an understand\nable urge: Sometimes the best reading of a text yields\nresults that one thinks must be a mistake, and bending\nthat reading just a little bit will allow all the pieces to fit\ntogether. But taking liberties with text in light of outcome\nmakes sense only if we assume that we know better than\nCongress which outcomes are mistaken. And by refusing\nto hold that Congress meant what it said, but see Con\nnecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253\u2013254\n(1992), we deprive it of the ability to say what it means in\nthe future.     It may be that no interpretation of\n\u00a71325(b)(1)(B) is entirely satisfying. But it is in the hard\ncases, even more than the easy ones, that we should faith\n14                HAMILTON v. LANNING\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nfully apply our settled interpretive principles, and trust\nthat Congress will correct the law if what it previously\nprescribed is wrong.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
