THOMAS, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09\u20135201. Argued March 30, 2010\u2014Decided June 7, 2010\nThe federal sentencing statute at issue provides that a \u201cprisoner . . .\n  serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year . . . may receive\n  credit toward the service of [that] sentence . . . of up to 54 days at the\n  end of each year\u201d subject to the Bureau of Prison\u2019s (BOP) \u201cdetermina\n  tion . . . that, during that year, the prisoner\u201d has behaved in an ex\n  emplary fashion. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73624(b)(1). Credit \u201cfor the last year or\n  portion of a year of the term of imprisonment [is] prorated . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n  The BOP applies this statute using a methodology that awards 54\n  days of credit at the end of each year the prisoner serves and sets\n  those days to the side. When the difference between the time re\n  maining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less\n  than one year, the BOP awards a prorated amount of credit for that\n  final year proportional to the awards in other years.\n     Petitioners claim that the BOP\u2019s calculation method is unlawful\n  because \u00a73624(b)(1) requires a calculation based on the length of the\n  term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, not the\n  length of time that the prisoner actually serves. The District Court\n  rejected this challenge in each of petitioner\u2019s cases, and the Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the BOP\u2019s method for calculating good time credit re\n flects the most natural reading of the statute, it is lawful. Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) The statute\u2019s language and purpose, taken together, support the\n BOP\u2019s method. That method tracks \u00a73624(b)\u2019s language by providing\n a prisoner a maximum credit of 54 days for each full year of impris\n onment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any addi\n tional time served that is less than a full year. As \u00a73624(b) directs,\n the BOP awards the credit \u201cat the end of each year\u201d of imprisonment.\n Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be reconciled with the statute. Because\n2                          BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much\n    time is actually served, a prisoner could receive credit for a year that\n    he does not spend in prison. Moreover the calculation of credit for\n    such a year would not be made \u201cat the end of\u201d that year. Nor could\n    the BOP determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior\n    \u201cduring that year.\u201d This language did not find its way into the stat\n    ute by accident. The differences between the prior provision (re\n    pealed in 1984)\u2014which granted the prisoner a deduction at the out\n    set of his sentence, subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rules\u2014\n    and the present statute\u2014under which \u201ccredit\u201d is \u201cearned\u201d \u201cat the end\n    of\u201d the year based on an evaluation of behavior \u201cduring that year\u201d\u2014\n    show an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospec\n    tive award. The BOP\u2019s method also furthers the basic purpose of the\n    statute. Section 3624 was part of the comprehensive Sentencing Re\n    form Act of 1984, which sought to achieve both increased sentencing\n    uniformity and greater honesty by \u201cmak[ing] all sentences basically\n    determinate.\u201d Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367. There\n    after, the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender\n    actually served, with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.\n    Ibid. Section 3624(b) states the reason for the exception: to provide\n    an incentive for prisoners to \u201ccompl[y] with institutional disciplinary\n    regulations.\u201d The exception is limited and tailored to its purpose\u2014\n    credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institu\n    tional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a\n    readily identifiable period of good behavior. The BOP\u2019s approach fur\n    thers \u00a73624\u2019s objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior\n    during the preceding year. In contrast, petitioners\u2019 approach would\n    allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence\n    that he served and the portion offset with earned credit, which would\n    loosen the statute\u2019s connection between good behavior and the good\n    time award. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) Arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. Context indicates\n    that the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d as used in the portion of\n    \u00a73624(b) at issue here refers to prison time actually served not, as pe\n    titioners contend, to the sentence imposed by the judge. Petitioners\u2019\n    reliance on legislative history is misplaced. A U. S. Sentencing Com\n    mission Supplementary Report is not helpful to them either, because\n    there is no indication that the Commission, in that report or in the\n    Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular ques\n    tion whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence\n    imposed. Nor, in light of the statute\u2019s text, structure, history, and\n    purpose, is this a case in which there is a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or un\n    certainty in the statute,\u201d Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125,\n    139, permitting application of the rule of lenity. Because the BOP\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  calculation system applies the statute as its language is most natu\n  rally read, and in accordance with the statute\u2019s basic purpose, this\n  Court need not determine the extent to which Congress has granted\n  the BOP authority to interpret the statute more broadly, or differ\n  ently than it has done here. Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re\n  sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844\u2013845. And because\n  the BOP\u2019s approach reflects the statute\u2019s most natural reading and is\n  the most consistent with its purpose, it is also preferable to the dis\n  sent\u2019s alternative interpretation.

S. C. \u00a73624(b). Petition\ners, two federal prisoners, challenge the method that the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons uses for calculating this \u201cgood\ntime credit.\u201d We conclude that the Bureau\u2019s method re\nflects the most natural reading of the statute, and we\nreject petitioners\u2019 legal challenge.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  A federal sentencing statute provides: \n\n    \u201c[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year . . . may receive credit toward the\n    service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence, beyond the time\n    served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the\n    prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end\n    of the first year of the term . . . . [C]redit for the last\n    year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment\n    shall be prorated and credited within the last six\n    weeks of the sentence.\u201d \u00a73624(b)(1).\n2                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) applies this statute using a\nmethodology that petitioners in this case challenge as\nunlawful. In order to explain the BOP method, we shall\nuse a simplified example that captures its essential ele\nments. The unsimplified calculations described by the\nBOP in its policy statement, see App. 96\u2013100, will reach\napproximately the same results as, and are essentially the\nmathematical equivalent of, the simplified system we\ndescribe (there may be other ways to describe the calcula\ntion as well). To the extent that there are any differences\nbetween the methodology employed by the BOP and that\nreflected in our example, they are of no consequence to the\nresolution of petitioners\u2019 challenge and are therefore not\nbefore us. Similarly, although petitioners committed their\ncrimes before the current version of \u00a73624 was enacted\nand are therefore subject to a previous version that dif\nfered slightly in certain details, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a73624\n(1988 ed.), the differences between the two versions are\nimmaterial to the questions presented by this case. The\nparties refer to the current version as the relevant provi\nsion of law, see Brief for Petitioners 2\u20133; Brief for Respon\ndent 8, n. 2, and we shall do the same.\n   In our example we shall imagine a prisoner who has\nreceived a sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. We shall\nassume that his behavior throughout his confinement is\nexemplary and that prison authorities will consequently\nconsider him to merit the maximum good time credit that\nthe statute will allow. And we shall ignore leap years.\n   Thus, at the end of the first year (Year 1) that prisoner\nwould earn the statute\u2019s maximum credit of 54 days. The\nrelevant official (whom we shall call the \u201cgood time calcu\nlator\u201d) would note that fact and, in effect, preliminarily\nput the 54 days to the side. At the end of Year 2 the pris\noner would earn an additional 54 days of good time credit.\nThe good time calculator would add this 54 days to the\nfirst 54 days, note the provisional total of 108 days, and\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagain put the 108 days\u2019 credit to the side. By the end of\nYear 8, the prisoner would have earned a total of 432 days\nof good time credit (8 years times 54 days). At that time,\nthe good time calculator would note that the difference\nbetween the time remaining in the sentence (2 years, or\n730 days) and the amount of accumulated good time credit\n(432 days) is less than 1 year (730 minus 432 equals 298\ndays, which is less than 365). The 432 days of good time\ncredit that the prisoner has earned by the end of Year 8\nare sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the 10-year\nprison term and to shorten the prisoner\u2019s 9th year of im\nprisonment by 67 days.\n   Year 9 of the sentence will consequently become the\nprisoner\u2019s last year of imprisonment. Further, because the\nprisoner has already earned 67 days of credit against that\nyear (432 days already earned minus 365 days applied to\nYear 10 leaves 67 days to apply to Year 9), the prisoner\nwill have no more than 298 days left to serve in Year 9.\nNow the good time calculator will have to work out just\nhow much good time the prisoner can earn, and credit\nagainst, these remaining 298 days.\n   As we said, the statute provides that \u201cgood time\u201d for this\n\u201clast year or portion\u201d thereof shall be \u201cprorated.\u201d Thus,\nthe good time calculator must divide the 298 days into two\nparts: (1) days that the prisoner will have to serve in\nprison, and (2) credit for good behavior the prisoner will\nearn during the days served in Year 9. In other words, the\nnumber of days to be served in Year 9 plus the number of\ngood time credit days earned will be equal to the number\nof days left in the sentence, namely, 298. And to keep the\naward of credit in the last year proportional to awards in\nother years, the ratio of these two parts of Year 9 (i.e., the\nnumber of good time days divided by the number of days\nserved) must be 54/365, the same ratio that the BOP\napplies to full years served. We can use some elementary\nalgebra, described in the Appendix, infra, to work out the\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrest. The result is that if the prisoner serves 260 days, he\ncan earn an additional 38 days of credit for good behavior.\nThat is to say, of the 298 days remaining in his sentence,\nthe prisoner will have to serve 260 days in confinement,\nafter which point, his sentence will be fully accounted for\n(given the additional 38 days\u2019 credit earned), and he will\nbe released. In sum, a prisoner subject to a 10-year\n(3,650-day) sentence who earns the maximum number of\ndays the statute permits will serve 3,180 days in confine\nment and receive 470 days of \u201cgood time\u201d credit, about\n15% of the prison time actually served.\n                               B\n   In this case petitioners claim that the BOP\u2019s calculation\nmethod is unlawful. They say that \u00a73624(b)(1) (2006 ed.)\nrequires a straightforward calculation based upon the\nlength of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing\njudge imposes, not the length of time that the prisoner\nactually serves. Thus, if a sentencing judge imposes a\nprison term of 10 years (as in our example), then, in peti\ntioners\u2019 view, the statute permits a maximum good time\naward of 540 days (10 years times 54 days), not the 470\ndays that the method described above would allow. And if\nthe judge imposes a prison term of 10 years and 6 months,\nthen the statute permits 567 days (540 days for the 10\nyears plus 27 days for the extra 6 months), not the 494\ndays that the method above would allow. According to\npetitioners, the BOP\u2019s method causes model prisoners to\nlose seven days of good time credit per year of imprison\nment, and because their sentences are fairly long (one,\nMichael Barber, was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months;\nthe other, Tahir Jihad-Black, was sentenced to 21 years\nand 10 months), the difference in their cases amounts to\nseveral months of additional prison time.\n   The District Court in each of these cases rejected the\nprisoner\u2019s challenge.

No. 08\u2013227\nMO (D Ore., Oct. 27, 2008), App. 25. And in each instance\nthe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court. Tablada\nv. Thomas, No. 07\u201335538 (CA9, Apr. 10, 2009), App. 11;\nsee also Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800 (CA9 2008).\nBecause the BOP\u2019s administration of good time credits\naffects the interests of a large number of federal prisoners,\nwe granted the consolidated petition for certiorari to con\nsider petitioners\u2019 challenge.\n                              II\n   Having now considered petitioners\u2019 arguments, we\nconclude that that we must reject their legal challenge.\nThe statute\u2019s language and its purpose, taken together,\nconvince us that the BOP\u2019s calculation method is lawful.\nFor one thing, that method tracks the language of\n\u00a73624(b). That provision says that a prisoner (serving a\nsentence of imprisonment of more than a year and less\nthan life) \u201cmay receive credit . . . of up to 54 days at the\nend of each year\u201d subject to the \u201cdetermination by the\nBureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner\u201d has\nbehaved in an exemplary fashion. Ibid. (emphasis added).\nAnd it says that credit for the \u201clast year or portion of a\nyear . . . shall be prorated and credited within the last six\nweeks of the sentence.\u201d Ibid. As the example in Part I\nmakes clear, the BOP\u2019s interpretation provides a prisoner\nentitled to a maximum annual credit with 54 days of good\ntime credit for each full year of imprisonment that he\nserves and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for\nany additional time served that is less than a full year.\nAnd, as \u00a73624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit at the\nend of each year of imprisonment (except, of course, for\nYear 9, which is subject to the statute\u2019s special instruction\nrequiring proration and crediting during the last six weeks\nof the sentence).\n   We are unable similarly to reconcile petitioners\u2019 ap\n6                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproach with the statute. Their system awards credit for\nthe sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is\nactually served. Thus, a prisoner under petitioners\u2019 sys\ntem could receive 54 days of credit for Year 10 despite the\nfact that he would be released after less than 81\u20442 years in\nprison. The good time calculation for Year 10 would not be\nmade \u201cat the end of\u201d Year 10 (nor within the last six weeks\nof a sentence ending during that year). Neither could the\nBOP determine whether the prisoner had behaved in\nexemplary fashion \u201cduring that year.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73624(b)\n(emphasis added); see also White v. Scibana, 390 F. 3d\n997, 1001 (CA7 2004) (\u201cThe Bureau cannot evaluate a\nprisoner\u2019s behavior and award credit for good conduct if\nthe prisoner is not still in prison\u201d); cf. McGinnis v. Royster,\n410 U. S. 263, 273 (1973) (\u201cWhere there is no evaluation\nby state officials and little or no rehabilitative participa\ntion for anyone to evaluate, there is a rational justification\nfor declining to give good-time credit\u201d).\n   We cannot say that this language (\u201cat the end of,\u201d \u201cdur\ning that year\u201d) found its way into the statute by accident.\nUnder the previous good time provision, a prisoner was\n\u201centitled to a deduction from the term of his sentence\nbeginning with the day on which the sentence commences\nto run.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a74161 (1982 ed.) (repealed 1984). This\ndeduction, granted at the outset of a prisoner\u2019s sentence,\nwas then made subject to forfeiture if the prisoner \u201ccom\nmit[ted] any offense or violate[d] the rules of the institu\ntion.\u201d \u00a74165 (repealed 1984). The present statute, \u00a73624\n(2006 ed.), in contrast, creates a system under which\n\u201ccredit\u201d is \u201cearned\u201d \u201cat the end of\u201d the year based on an\nevaluation of behavior \u201cduring that year.\u201d We agree with\nthe Government that \u201c[t]he textual differences between\nthe two statutes reveal a purpose to move from a system of\nprospective entitlement to a system of retrospective\naward.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33; see also White, supra, at\n1002, n. 3.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   For another thing, the BOP\u2019s method better furthers the\nstatute\u2019s basic purpose. The \u201cgood time\u201d provision in\n\u00a73624 is part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98\nStat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991\u2013\n998, a comprehensive law that reformed federal sentenc\ning practice and directed the newly created United States\nSentencing Commission \u201cto devise guidelines to be used\nfor sentencing\u201d in district courts, Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989). Under the previous\nregime, the United States Parole Commission, \u201cas a gen\neral rule, [could] conditionally release a prisoner any time\nafter he serve[d] one-third of the judicially fixed term.\u201d\nUnited States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 47 (1978). If, for\nexample, a judge imposed a prison term of 15 years, the\nParole Commission might have released the prisoner after\nonly 5 years. And it routinely did so. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a71A3, p. s., p.\n1.2 (Oct. 1987) (USSG) (\u201c[D]efendants often serv[ed] only\nabout one-third of the sentence handed down by the\ncourt\u201d). The result was \u201cconfusion and implicit deception.\u201d\nIbid. With the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress sought to\nachieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater\nhonesty by \u201cmak[ing] all sentences basically determinate,\u201d\nMistretta, supra, at 367. See USSG \u00a71A3, p. s., at 1.2\n(statutory objectives included \u201chonesty in sentencing,\u201d\n\u201cuniformity,\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n   Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the\nsentence the offender actually served, with a sole statutory\nexception for good time credits. Mistretta, supra, at 367 (a\n\u201cprisoner is to be released at the completion of his sen\ntence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior\nwhile in custody\u201d (citing \u00a73624(b)). The reason for this\nexception is provided in \u00a73624(b) itself: to provide an\nincentive for prisoners to \u201ccompl[y] with institutional\ndisciplinary regulations.\u201d The good time exception is\nlimited (to 54 days per year) and tailored to its purpose\u2014\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncredit is earned at the end of the year after compliance\nwith institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby\nrewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good\nbehavior.\n   The BOP\u2019s approach furthers the objective of \u00a73624. It\nties the award of good time credits directly to good behav\nior during the preceding year of imprisonment. By con\ntrast, petitioners\u2019 approach, insofar is it would award up to\n54 days per year of time sentenced as opposed to time\nserved, allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion\nof his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sen\ntence that he offsets with earned good time credit. In\nother words, petitioners argue that the BOP should award\ngood time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in\nprison and behaves appropriately, but also for days that\nhe will not spend in prison at all, such as Year 10 in our\nexample. By doing so, it loosens the statute\u2019s connection\nbetween good behavior and the award of good time and\ntransforms the nature of the exception to the basic sen\ntence-imposed-is-sentence-served rule. And to that extent,\nit is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s basic purpose.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  We are not convinced by petitioners\u2019 several arguments\nagainst the BOP\u2019s methodology. First, petitioners point to\nthe statement in \u00a73624(b) that a prisoner \u201cmay receive\ncredit . . . at the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s term of\nimprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The words \u201cterm of\nimprisonment,\u201d they say, must refer to the years of the\nterm that the sentencing judge imposed (10 years in our\nexample), not the (less-than-10) years of the term that the\nprisoner actually served once good time credits were taken\ninto account. After all, the very first phrase of that provi\nsion makes eligible for good time credits \u201ca prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthan a term of imprisonment for the duration of the pris\noner\u2019s life.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The\nwords \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d in this phrase almost cer\ntainly refer to the sentence imposed, not to the time actu\nally served (otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a\nday would become ineligible for credit as soon as they\nearned it). And, as petitioners emphasize, we have recog\nnized a \u201cpresumption that a given term is used to mean\nthe same thing throughout a statute,\u201d Brown v. Gardner,\n513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n  The problem for petitioners, however, is that this pre\nsumption is not absolute. It yields readily to indications\nthat the same phrase used in different parts of the same\nstatute means different things, particularly where the\nphrase is one that speakers can easily use in different\nways without risk of confusion. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers,\nInc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932); General\nDynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595\u2013\n596 (2004). See, e.g., id., at 596\u2013597 (\u201cage\u201d has different\nmeanings in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,\n532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) (same for \u201c \u2018wages paid\u2019 \u201d in the\nInternal Revenue Code); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 343\u2013344 (1997) (same for \u201cemployee\u201d in Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).\n  The phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d is just such a\nphrase. It can refer to the sentence that the judge im\nposes, see, e.g., \u00a73624(a) (\u201cA prisoner shall be released\u201d at\nthe end of \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, less any\ntime credited\u201d for good behavior), but it also can refer to\nthe time that the prisoner actually serves. Thus, \u00a73624(d)\nof the statute before us requires BOP to \u201cfurnish [a] pris\noner with . . . suitable clothing[,] . . . money, . . . and . . .\ntransportation\u201d \u201c[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the\nexpiration of the prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d (Em\nphasis added.) The statute here means to assure that the\n10                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprisoner is provided with these necessities at the time of\nhis actual release from prison (sometime during Year 9 in\nour example), not at the end of the term that the judge\nimposed (which would be over a year later). Since the\nstatute uses the same phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d in\ntwo different ways, the presumption cannot help petition\ners here. And, for the reasons we have given, see Part II,\nsupra, context here indicates that the particular instance\nof the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d at issue refers to\nprison time actually served rather than the sentence\nimposed by the judge.\n   Second, petitioners seek to draw support from the stat\nute\u2019s legislative history. But those who consider legisla\ntive history significant cannot find that history helpful to\npetitioners here. Petitioners point, for example, to a\nstatement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sen\ntencing Reform Act, which says that the \u201cmethod of calcu\nlation\u201d of good time \u201cwill be considerably less complicated\nthan under current law in many respects,\u201d and that \u201ccredit\ntoward early release is earned at a steady and easily\ndetermined rate that will have an obvious impact on the\nprisoner\u2019s release date.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 146\u2013147\n(1983); see Brief for Petitioners 31\u201332. But these state\nments are consistent with the BOP\u2019s interpretation of the\nstatute. Its method, as we understand it, is not particu\nlarly difficult to apply and it is certainly less complex than\nprior law, which provided for the accumulation of two\ndifferent kinds of good time credit (general and industrial),\ncalculated in different manners (prospectively and retro\nspectively), and awarded at different rates, depending on\nthe length of sentence imposed on the prisoner (5 to 10\ndays per month for general) or the year of employment (3\nor 5 days per month for industrial). See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a74161, 4162 (1982 ed.).\n   Petitioners also point to various statements contained in\nthe Act\u2019s Conference Report and made by individual legis\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlators that describe good time credit as providing sentence\nreductions of 15%. See Brief for Petitioners 34\u201336 (citing,\ne.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98\u20131159, p. 415 (1984); 131\nCong. Rec. 488 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Hamilton)). But\nthere is nothing in the context of these statements to\nsuggest that they amounted to anything other than rough\napproximations or that they were made with the present\ncontroversy in mind. See, e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98\u2013\n1159, at 415 (noting simply that an increase in the amount\nof maximum annual credit from 36 days to 54 days \u201cin\ncreases \u2018good time\u2019 that accrues from 10 percent to 15\npercent\u201d); 131 Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (statement of Rep.\nHamilton) (\u201cUnder [pre-Sentencing Reform Act] law, about\n80% of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of\ntheir time. Now sentences will be reduced only 15% for\ngood behavior\u201d). And whatever interpretive force one\nattaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives\nlittle weight to statements, such as those of the individual\nlegislators, made after the bill in question has become law.\nSee, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 298 (1995).\n   Third, petitioners rely on a statement in the United\nStates Sentencing Commission\u2019s Supplementary Report on\nthe Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements\nissued in 1987 (hereinafter Supplementary Report). In\nthat Report, the Commission summarized its analysis of\nrecent pre-Guidelines sentencing practice, which it had\nused to help draft the Guidelines. The results of the\nanalysis were presented in a table that permits compari\nson of the likely prison-time consequences of the new\nGuidelines with prison time actually served under pre-\nGuidelines practice (specifically, by identifying the Guide\nlines \u201coffense level that is closest to the average time . . .\nserved by first-time offenders\u201d convicted of a particular\ncrime, Supplementary Report 23). Because the Guidelines\n\u201crefer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time\u201d (i.e.,\nbecause a Guidelines sentence of, say, 30 months\u2019 impris\n12                 BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nonment does not necessarily mean that the offender will\nserve the entire 30 months in prison), the Commission\nadjusted the average time served \u201cby dividing by 0.85 good\ntime when the term exceeded 12 months.\u201d Ibid. This\nadjustment, the Commission explained, \u201cmade sentences\nin the [t]able comparable with those in the guidelines.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later\neditions of the Guidelines to a potential credit of \u201cap\nproximately fifteen percent for good behavior,\u201d see, e.g.,\nUSSG \u00a71A3, p. s., at 3 (Nov. 2009), petitioners maintain\nthat the Commission set its Guideline ranges with the\nexpectation that well-behaved prisoners would receive\ngood time credit of up to 15% of the sentence imposed, not\n15% of the time actually served. They add that, in setting\nthe Guidelines ranges in this way, the Commission exer\ncised congressionally delegated power to interpret the\nSentencing Reform Act, see Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 371\u2013\n379 (approving Congress\u2019 delegation of the power to prom\nulgate sentencing guidelines), and that as long as that\ninterpretation is reasonable, courts must defer to it. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013844 (1984).\n   Again, however, we can find no indication that the\nCommission, in writing its Supplementary Report or in\nthe Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the\nparticular question here before us, that is whether good\ntime credit is to be based on time served or the sentence\nimposed. The Guidelines Manual itself, a more authorita\ntive account of the Commission\u2019s interpretive views than\nthe Supplementary Report, says nothing directly on that\nsubject. Moreover, with respect to comparisons between\nGuidelines sentences and pre-Guidelines practice, the\noriginal 1987 Manual cautioned that the Guidelines did\nnot \u201csimply cop[y] estimates of existing practice as re\nvealed by the data,\u201d but rather \u201cdeparted from the data at\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent points for various important reasons.\u201d USSG\n\u00a71A3, p. s., at 1.4; see also id., \u00a71A4(g), p. s., at 1.11\n(while \u201cGuideline sentences in many instances will ap\nproximate existing [i.e., pre-Guidelines] practice,\u201d the\nCommission did \u201cnot conside[r] itself bound by existing\nsentencing practice\u201d (emphasis added)). Because the\nCommission has expressed no view on the question before\nus, we need not decide whether it would be entitled to\ndeference had it done so. If it turns out that the calcula\ntion of good time credit based on prison time served rather\nthan the sentence imposed produces results that are more\nsevere than the Commission finds appropriate, the Com\nmission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accord\ningly. See id., \u00a71A2, at 1.2 (acknowledging that \u201cthe\nguideline-writing process is evolutionary\u201d and that the\nCommission functions \u201cas a permanent agency to monitor\nsentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the\nnation\u201d).\n   Fourth, petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity\nand construe \u00a73624 (2006 ed.) in their favor, that is, in a\nway that will maximize the amount of available good time\ncredit. We may assume for present purposes that \u00a73624(b)\ncan be construed as imposing a criminal penalty. See\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (rule of\nlenity applies to \u201cinterpretations of . . . the penalties\u201d\nimposed by \u201ccriminal prohibitions\u201d); but see Sash v. Zenk,\n428 F. 3d 132, 134 (CA2 2005) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding\nthat \u00a73624(b) is not a criminal statute for the purposes of\nthe rule of lenity). Even so, the rule of lenity only applies\nif, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose,\nthere remains a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the\nstatute,\u201d Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that the\nCourt must simply \u201c \u2018guess as to what Congress intended.\u2019 \u201d\nBifulco, supra, at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States,\n358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). See United States v. Hayes,\n14                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13); United States v.\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305\u2013306 (1992) (plurality opinion).\nHaving so considered the statute, we do not believe that\nthere remains a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty\u201d in the\nstatutory provision before us. Nor need we now simply\n\u201cguess\u201d what the statute means.\n  Finally, we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to\nthe BOP\u2019s implementation of \u00a73624(b). In our view, the\nBOP\u2019s calculation system applies that statute as its lan\nguage is most naturally read, and in accordance with what\nthat language makes clear is its basic purpose. No one\ndoubts that the BOP has the legal power to implement the\nstatute in accordance with its language and purposes;\nhence we need not determine the extent to which Congress\nhas granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute\nmore broadly, or differently than it has done here. Cf.\nChevron, supra, at 844\u2013845.\n                              B\n  Acknowledging that petitioners\u2019 arguments cannot carry\nthe day, the dissent has proposed a \u201cthird possibility,\u201d\npost, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), not raised by either\nparty nor, to our knowledge, used elsewhere in the Crimi\nnal Code. The dissent reads the statutory phrase \u201cterm of\nimprisonment\u201d to refer to \u201cthe administrative period along\nwhich progress toward eventual freedom is marked.\u201d Post,\nat 3. It derives from this reading the following method of\ncalculation as applied to our 10-year example. First, \u201c[t]he\nsentence is divided into 10 365-day segments.\u201d Ibid. At\nthe end of the first segment, a prisoner may receive up to\n54 days of credit for good behavior. These credits immedi\nately \u201cgo toward completion of the next year\u201d so that the\nprisoner need only serve \u201canother 311 days behind bars\nbefore the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an\nend.\u201d Ibid. This process repeats itself until the \u201c10th\nsegment,\u201d in which a prisoner receives an unspecified\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201ccredit in a prorated amount.\u201d Ibid. In the end, the pris\noner will have served 10 \u201cadministrative segments,\u201d ibid.,\ncollectively comprising 3,117 days in prison and 533 days\nof credit.\n   The dissent claims \u201c[r]eading \u2018term of imprisonment\u2019\nthis way is consistent with all parts of the statute.\u201d Post,\nat 4. We see at least four problems. First, the opening\nsentence of \u00a73624(a) instructs that \u201c[a] prisoner shall be\nreleased\u201d upon \u201cthe expiration of the prisoner\u2019s term of\nimprisonment, less any time credited\u201d for good behavior.\nBut if a prisoner\u2019s \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d is the \u201cperiod\nthat a prisoner must complete in order to earn his free\ndom,\u201d post, at 4, and it is \u201caccounted for through a combi\nnation of prison time and credits,\u201d post, at 3, then a pris\noner should be released exactly at the end of his term of\nimprisonment (without any further adjustment). Because\nthe dissent\u2019s approach would require us to read words out\nof the statute, or give prisoners double credit, its definition\ncannot be used here.\n   Second, \u00a73624(b)(1) tells us that a prisoner receives\ncredit \u201cat the end of each year\u201d based on behavior \u201cduring\nthat year.\u201d Under the dissent\u2019s approach, however, a\nprisoner may receive credit at the end of each \u201cadministra\ntive segmen[t]\u201d presumably based on his behavior during\nthat segment. And because an \u201cadministrative segmen[t]\u201d\nis made up of some \u201ccombination of service and credits,\u201d\npost, at 4, each one lasts less than a calendar year. We do\nnot see how a system in which \u201ca prisoner may complete a\nparticular year of his term in less than 365 calendar days,\u201d\nibid., and receive full good time credit for doing so, can\npossibly represent the most natural reading of this statu\ntory language. Nor do we know, because the BOP has not\nhad an opportunity to tell us, whether a system in which a\n\u201cyear\u201d lasts anywhere from 311 to 365 calendar days (and\nin which the \u201cyears\u201d of a single prisoner\u2019s sentence may all\nbe of different lengths), is easily administrable. (We doubt\n16                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat this system will be more comprehensible to prisoners\nthan one, like the BOP\u2019s, that provides credit for actual\nyears.)\n   Third, under the dissent\u2019s approach, credit is earned at\ndifferent rates during a single sentence. For the first\n\u201cadministrative segmen[t]\u201d in its 10-year example, the\nprisoner serves 365 days and earns 54 days of credit. The\nratio of credit earned to days served is .148. For the sec\nond \u201cadministrative segmen[t],\u201d the prisoner serves 311\ndays and earns 54 days of credit. This time, the ratio of\ncredit earned to days served is .174. (For the last \u201cadmin\nistrative segmen[t],\u201d the dissent tells us the prisoner will\nreceive \u201ccredit in a prorated amount,\u201d but it does not tell\nus which ratio should be used for the proration. Post, at\n3.) The use of different rates finds no support in the stat\nute. The dissent objects that the statute \u201cprescribes no\nparticular rate,\u201d post, at 7, but in fact it does\u201454 days of\ncredit per year of good behavior\u2014and it further requires\nthat credit for the last year be \u201cprorated\u201d using the same\nproportion. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s application of different\nrates leads to odd results. For example, a model prisoner\nsentenced on two separate 5-year terms (with a break in\nbetween) will serve a different number of days from one\nsentenced to a single 10-year term. How can this be if\nboth prisoners are earning 54 days of credit for each of\ntheir 10 years in prison?\n   Fourth, \u00a73624(b)(2) provides that good time credit \u201cshall\nvest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.\u201d\n(This provision does not apply to prisoners, like petition\ners, who committed their offenses before it was amended\nin 1996, but the dissent plainly intends for its approach to\napply more broadly. See post, at 9 (noting the effect on\n\u201calmost 200,000 federal prisoners\u201d).) Yet under the dis\nsent\u2019s approach, credit appears to vest immediately. See\npost, at 3 (Days of credit for the first year \u201cgo toward\ncompletion of the next year\u201d so that the prisoner \u201cwould\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nneed another 311 days behind bars before the second year\nof his term of imprisonment is at an end\u201d). And if it does\nnot, then the situation quickly becomes complicated.\nWhat happens if, say, on the last day of the 10th \u201cadminis\ntrative segmen[t]\u201d (somewhere in the 8th calendar year), a\nprisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him\nby taking away all of his previously earned credit? Cf. 28\nCFR \u00a7541.13 (2009) (prescribing sanctions for prohibited\nacts). Does the BOP retroactively adjust the duration of\nall of his administrative segments to 365 days so that the\nprisoner now finds himself in the middle of the 8th \u201cad\nministrative segmen[t]\u201d? (Again we do not know if the\nBOP would find such a system administrable, and we\ndoubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a\nprisoner.) If so, does the prisoner have a second opportu\nnity to earn credit for good behavior for the 9th \u201cadminis\ntrative segmen[t]\u201d that he had previously completed but\nnow must account for again? Cf. \u00a73624(b)(1) (\u201cCredit that\nhas not been earned may not later be granted\u201d). Or, hav\ning previously awarded (and taken away) credit for that\nsegment, are prison authorities left without any incentive\nto offer for good behavior?\n  Finally, the dissent, like petitioners, invokes the rule of\nlenity to support its interpretation. But, the best efforts of\nthe dissent notwithstanding, we still see no \u201cgrievous\nambiguity or uncertainty\u201d that would trigger the rule\u2019s\napplication. We remain convinced that the BOP\u2019s ap\nproach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory\nlanguage and the most consistent with its purpose. What\never the merits of the dissent\u2019s policy arguments, the\nstatute does not require the BOP to accept them.\n\n For all of these reasons, we conclude that the BOP\u2019s\nmethodology is lawful. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment is\n\n                                                    Affirmed.\n18                   BARBER v.

At the end of Year 8, the prisoner\nhas 2 years remaining in his sentence and has accumu\nlated 432 days of good time credit. Because the difference\nbetween the time remaining in his sentence and the\namount of accumulated credit (i.e., 730 - 432) is less than a\nyear (298 days), Year 9 is the last year he will spend in\nprison. (Year 10 has been completely offset by 365 of the\n432 days of accumulated credit.) Further, Year 9 will be a\npartial year of 298 days (the other 67 days of the year\nbeing offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit).\n   Here is where the elementary algebra comes in. We\nknow that x, the good time, plus y, the remaining time\nserved, must add up to 298. This gives us our first equa\ntion: x + y = 298.\n   We also know that the ratio of good time earned in the\nportion of the final year to the amount of time served in\nthat year must equal the ratio of a full year\u2019s good time\ncredit to the amount of time served in a full year. The\nlatter ratio is 54/365 or .148. Thus, we know that\nx/y = .148, or to put it another way, x = .148y. Because we\nknow the value of x in terms of y, we can make a substitu\ntion in our first equation to get .148y + y = 298. We then\nadd the two y terms together (1.148y = 298), and we solve\nfor y, which gives us y = 260. Now we can plug that value\ninto our first equation to solve for x (the good time credit).\nIf we subtract 260 from 298, we find that x = 38.\n   The offender will have to serve 260 days in prison in\nYear 9, and he will receive 38 days additional good time\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The prisoner\u2019s total good time\nis 470 days (432 + 38 = 470). His total time served is 3180\ndays.\n   As a final matter, while we have described the foregoing\nas the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last\nyear to more transparently track the relevant statutory\nlanguage, we note that the mathematical formula can be\nused to calculate the amount of maximum available credit\nfor an entire sentence. Using the equations supplied\nabove, if we divide the total number of days in a sentence\nby 1.148, we get the minimum number of days that a\ndefendant must serve in that sentence. If we then sub\ntract the number of days served from the total number of\ndays in the sentence, we arrive at the maximum number\nof good time credit days the prisoner can earn. The stat\nute, however, awards them on a yearly basis (but for the\n\u201clast year or portion\u201d thereof).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

See Pet. for Cert. 11, and n. 2. It adopts this\nreading despite the existence of an alternative interpreta\ntion that is more consistent with the statute\u2019s text. Absent\na clear congressional directive, the statute ought not to be\nread as the Court reads it. For the Court\u2019s interpreta\ntion\u2014an interpretation that in my submission is quite\nincorrect\u2014imposes tens of thousands of years of additional\nprison time on federal prisoners according to a mathe\nmatical formula they will be unable to understand. And if\nthe only way to call attention to the human implications of\nthis case is to speak in terms of economics, then it should\nbe noted that the Court\u2019s interpretation comes at a cost to\nthe taxpayers of untold millions of dollars. See id., at 11.\nThe interpretation the Court adopts, moreover, will be\ndevastating to the prisoners who have behaved the best\nand will undermine the purpose of the statute. These\nconsiderations, and those stated below, require this re\nspectful dissent.\n                            I\n  The federal sentencing statute at issue here provides:\n2                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    \u201c[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year[,] other than a term of imprisonment\n    for the duration of the prisoner\u2019s life, may receive\n    credit toward the service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence,\n    beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of\n    each year of the prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, be\n    ginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject\n    to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, dur\n    ing that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary\n    compliance with institutional disciplinary regula\n    tions. . . . [C]redit for the last year or portion of a year\n    of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and\n    credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.\u201d 18\n    U. S. C. \u00a73624(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nAccording to the Court, the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d\nmust mean \u201ctime actually served\u201d the third time that it\nappears in this particular subsection. But the Court gives\nthe phrase a different interpretation the first two times it\nis used in the very same sentence. This in itself indicates\nthat something is quite wrong here.\n   Petitioners invite the Court to read \u201cterm of imprison\nment\u201d to mean \u201cthe sentence imposed.\u201d This, too, seems\nunworkable. And it can be acknowledged that the Court\u2019s\nrejection of this interpretation is correct.\n   The choice, however, is not just between the Court\u2019s\nreading and that offered by petitioners. There is a third\npossibility, one more consistent with the statute than\neither of these two alternatives.\n   A fair reading of the statute, and a necessary reading to\naccomplish its purpose best, is to interpret the phrase\n\u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d to refer to the span of time that a\nprisoner must account for in order to obtain release. The\nlength of the term is set at the outset by the criminal\nsentence imposed. The prisoner earns release when that\nterm has been fully completed. Most of the term will be\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsatisfied through time spent behind bars. Assuming the\nprisoner is well behaved, however, he may earn good time\ncredits along the way; and those credits may substitute for\nactual prison time. Each year of the term comprises a full\n365 days, which must be accounted for through a combina\ntion of prison time and credits. Thus conceived, a pris\noner\u2019s \u201cterm\u201d is the administrative period along which\nprogress toward eventual freedom is marked.\n   Consider the Court\u2019s example of a prisoner subject to a\nten-year sentence. See ante, at 2\u20134. The sentence is\ndivided into ten 365-day segments. Each segment consti\ntutes a year of the term. The prisoner will spend the first\n365 days behind bars. In the statute\u2019s words, he has\nreached \u201cthe end of the first year of the term.\u201d Now is the\ntime for credit to be awarded, and he may receive up to 54\ndays if sufficiently well behaved. Because he has already\ncompleted a full year of his term, those credits go toward\ncompletion of the next year. If, based on good behavior, he\nhas earned the maximum of 54 days, he would need an\nother 311 days behind bars before the second year of his\nterm of imprisonment is at an end (because 54 + 311 =\n365). If he has earned fewer than 54 days, a longer incar\nceration will be required to reach 365. Regardless, once\nthe prisoner reaches the end of the second year of his\nterm, he will again be eligible to receive good time credits.\n   This process repeats itself for the third year of the term,\nand so on. In the final year of his term (in this example,\nthe tenth segment into which his term has been divided),\nthe prisoner will receive credit in a prorated amount, to be\nawarded \u201cwithin the last six weeks of the sentence.\u201d This\nensures that the prisoner does not reach the end of year\nten, only to find that he has just earned 54 days of credit\nhe no longer needs.\n   The controlling rule is that each year of the prisoner\u2019s\nterm\u2014each of the ten administrative segments\u2014\ncomprises 365 days that must be completed through a\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncombination of service and credits. By combining actual\nprison time with the credits he has earned, a prisoner may\ncomplete a particular year of his term in less than 365\ncalendar days. As a result, credits may enable a well\nbehaved prisoner to complete his ten-year sentence before\nten calendar years have elapsed. For a ten-year (3,650\nday) sentence, a prisoner will serve 3,117 days behind bars\nif he earns a maximum of approximately 533 credits. This\nis 63 more days of credit than under the Court\u2019s reading\u2014\nmore than 6 additional credit days for every year of the\nsentence imposed.\n   Reading \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d this way is consistent\nwith all parts of the statute. The prisoner receives his\ncredit \u201cat the end of each year of [his] term of imprison\nment,\u201d a process that \u201cbegin[s] at the end of the first year\nof the term.\u201d Credit is only awarded if the prisoner has\nproven well behaved \u201cduring that year.\u201d This interpreta\ntion fulfills the \u201cobjective of \u00a73624\u201d\u2014rewarding a prisoner\nfor exemplary conduct during the preceding year. See\nante, at 8.\n   This approach also has a textual integrity that the\nCourt\u2019s reading does not: It gives \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d\nthe same meaning each time it is used by the statute.\nEvery time it appears in \u00a73624(b)(1), \u201cterm of imprison\nment\u201d refers to the administrative period that a prisoner\nmust complete in order to earn his freedom. The Court, by\ncontrast, would read this phrase to mean \u201ctime actually\nserved\u201d the third time it is used, but \u201cthe sentence im\nposed\u201d the first two times it is used (\u201c \u2018a prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year[,]\nother than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the\nprisoner\u2019s life\u2019 \u201d). See ante, at 8\u20139. The Court\u2019s interpreta\ntion thus runs afoul of the \u201c \u2018presumption that a given\nterm is used to mean the same thing throughout a stat\nute.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9 (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 118 (1994)). The inconsistency here is particularly\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\negregious because all three uses appear in the same sen\ntence. See id., at 118 (\u201c[The] presumption [is] surely at its\nmost vigorous when a term is repeated within a given\nsentence\u201d).\n   The Court responds by noting another part of the stat\nute, a provision stating that prisoners shall receive cloth\ning, money, and transportation \u201c[u]pon the release of [the]\nprisoner on the expiration of the prisoner\u2019s term of impris\nonment.\u201d \u00a73624(d). A prisoner is released at the end of\nhis actual time behind bars, says the Court, and so \u201cterm\nof imprisonment\u201d must here refer to time actually served.\nYet release also comes at the end of a prisoner\u2019s \u201cterm\u201d in\nthe sense described above\u2014that is, when the balance of\nthe sentence has been reduced to zero through a combina\ntion of prison time and good time credits. Indeed, this\nadministrative use of the phrase fits well with the word\n\u201cexpiration,\u201d which in its most natural sense in this con\ntext refers to the close of a formal accounting period. See\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 619 (8th ed. 2004) (\u201cA coming to\nan end; esp., a formal termination on a closing date\u201d). By\ncontrast, it is awkward at best to say, as the Court would\nhave it, that a prisoner\u2019s actual time behind bars is some\nthing that \u201cexpires.\u201d\n   The Court\u2019s approach produces yet another oddity. The\nstatute requires that prorated credit be awarded for \u201cthe\nlast year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment.\u201d\nOne might naturally assume that the last year of a ten\nyear term would be year ten. That is how things work\nunder the approach described above, in which a ten-year\nsentence is subdivided into ten administrative segments.\n   But under the Court\u2019s reading, a prisoner serving a ten\nyear sentence will never reach year ten of his term; year\nten simply does not exist. According to the Court, year\nnine is the final year, and even year nine is not a full year:\nIt lasts \u201cno more than 298 days.\u201d Ante, at 3. If this\nsounds confusing, it will be all the more so to the prisoner\n6                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwho has just received his sentence and turns to the statute\nbooks to figure out when to expect his freedom.\n   The Court does not even attempt to defend these flaws.\nInstead, it points to four supposed defects in the approach\ndescribed above. None withstands examination.\n   First, the Court notes that the statute requires the\nrelease of a prisoner \u201cupon \u2018the expiration of the prisoner\u2019s\nterm of imprisonment, less any time credited\u2019 for good\nbehavior.\u201d Ante, at 15 (quoting \u00a73624(a)). But if \u201cterm of\nimprisonment\u201d truly refers to the entire span that a pris\noner must complete to earn his freedom\u2014a period that\naccounts both for actual time and for good time credits\u2014\nthen why would the \u201cless any time credited\u201d language be\nappropriate? The answer is that this provision\u2014which\nappears at the very beginning of the section entitled \u201cRe\nlease of a prisoner\u201d\u2014announces to a prisoner when release\nmay be expected: when the prisoner\u2019s term expires, taking\ninto account credit days \u201cas provided in subsection (b).\u201d\n\u00a73624(a) (bold face deleted). This use of language is com\nmon. A debtor who says \u201cI will write a check for what I\nowe you, less what you owe me\u201d is simply saying \u201cI will\npay what I owe, taking into account your debts to me.\u201d\nPerhaps the same meaning could have been conveyed\nusing different words, but this is hardly probative.\n   Second, the Court alleges that the above approach con\nflicts with the statute\u2019s requirement that credit be\nawarded \u201cat the end of each year\u201d based upon behavior\n\u201cduring that year.\u201d After all, if a year of the term can be\nsatisfied in part through credit, then it may last less than\na full calendar year. Yet the statute does not require that\ncredit be awarded at the end of a calendar year for good\nbehavior during a calendar year. What it requires is that\ncredit be awarded \u201cat the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s\nterm of imprisonment\u201d for good behavior \u201cduring that\nyear.\u201d And this is precisely what the above approach does.\n   Third, the Court frets that, under the approach above,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nprisoners will earn credit at different rates during a single\nsentence. It admonishes that \u201c[t]he use of different rates\nfinds no support in the statute.\u201d Ante, at 16. This re\nsponse is telling. The statute, in fact, prescribes no par\nticular rate\u2014and certainly no formula based on a rate\u2014\nexcept as embodied in one clear directive: Prisoners are\neligible to earn \u201cup to 54 days at the end of each year of\nthe prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d As to that com\nmand, the above approach is perfectly faithful.\n   Fourth, the Court suggests that the above approach\ncauses credit to vest immediately, contrary to the statute.\nAgain, this is not true. As per the statute, credit only\nvests \u201con the date the prisoner is released from custody,\u201d\n\u00a73624(b)(2), meaning that it can be revoked at any time\nbefore that date. This gives prisoners approaching their\nrelease date an extra incentive to behave.\n   As a fallback, the Court wonders what would happen if\na prisoner misbehaved on the final day of his ten-year\nsentence. Would the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) be forced to\n\u201cretroactively adjust the duration of all of his [term years]\nto 365 days\u201d? Ante, at 17. The answer is what one might\nsuppose: A prisoner whose credits are revoked will find\nhimself precisely where he would have been if those cred\nits had never been earned. All years of the term remain\n365 days, as they always have. But a misbehaving pris\noner who had formerly earned, say, 500 credits will find\nhimself without the benefit of those 500 days. That will\nleave him with more of his term to complete\u2014500 days\nmore, to be precise. If he behaves well again, he can re\nsume earning credit for the remainder of his term, but he\nhas lost the opportunity to earn credits for any prior years.\nSee \u00a73624(b)(1). This is not at all confusing for a prisoner;\nand certainly it is as straightforward, if not more so, than\nthe Court\u2019s approach. The Court\u2019s view causes a prisoner\u2019s\n\u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d to shrink over time according to\nan algebraic formula, only to expand again if he misbe\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nhaves.\n   Finally, the Court speculates that BOP might find the\nabove approach difficult to administer. The Court identi\nfies no basis for this claim, nor does one exist. The infor\nmation used to calculate a prisoner\u2019s term under the above\napproach is the same as it is under the Court\u2019s approach.\nTrue, a prisoner may become eligible to be awarded credit\non different calendar days during the course of his term.\nBut under the Court\u2019s approach, this also happens when\nawarding credit in the final year. And, it goes without\nsaying, federal prisoners begin their incarceration on\ndifferent calendar days anyway, so that under any ap\nproach, BOP will be forced to evaluate prisoners through\nout the calendar year.\n                               II\n   The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a73624(b)(1), therefore, is less\nconsistent with the text than the reading explained above.\nBut even if these interpretations were in equipoise, under\nany fair application the rule of lenity should tip the bal\nance in petitioners\u2019 favor. When a penal statute is suscep\ntible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to the\ndefendant must be chosen unless \u201ctext, structure, and\nhistory . . . establish that the [harsher] position is unam\nbiguously correct.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.\n39, 54 (1994). Resolving ambiguity in favor of lenity en\nsures that statutes provide \u201cfair warning[,] . . . in language\nthat the common world will understand, of what the law\nintends to do if a certain line is passed.\u201d United States v.\nBass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The rule thus applies \u201cnot only to interpreta\ntions of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but\nalso to the penalties they impose.\u201d Bifulco v. United\nStates, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980).\n   The Court assumes without deciding that \u00a73624(b) is\npenal in nature. See ante, at 13. No assumption is neces\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 32\n(1981). In Weaver, the Court considered whether an\namendment to Florida\u2019s statutory formula for calculating\ngood time credits implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nThe Court concluded that it did, as the new statute \u201csub\nstantially alter[ed] the consequences attached to a crime\nalready completed, and therefore change[d] \u2018the quantum\nof punishment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 33 (quoting Dobbert v. Florida,\n432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977)). For the same reason, the penal\neffect of \u00a73624(b)(1) is substantial enough to implicate the\nrule of lenity. We should not disadvantage almost 200,000\nfederal prisoners unless Congress clearly warned them\nthey would face that harsh result.\n                              III\n   The Government\u2014although not the Court\u2014argues that\nwe should embrace its interpretation out of deference to\nBOP. BOP has been charged by the Attorney General\nwith responsibility for \u201c[a]pproving inmate disciplinary\nand good time regulations.\u201d 28 CFR \u00a70.96(s) (2009). BOP\nhas long followed the same credit-calculation method now\nadvocated by the Court. The Government argues that we\nshould defer to BOP\u2019s choice as a permissible exercise of\nits delegated responsibility.\n   This argument fails on multiple levels. There is no\nindication that BOP has exercised the sort of interpretive\nauthority that would merit deference under Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984). The statute does not create a legis\nlative gap for BOP to fill. To the contrary, the procedures\nthat govern the timing of credit awards are spelled out in\ngreat detail. Cf. Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241\u2013242\n(2001) (where statute says that BOP \u201cmay\u201d grant early\n10                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrelease to certain prisoners, without specifying further\ncriteria, Congress deliberately created a \u201cstatutory gap\u201d).\nThe statute even goes so far as to explain what to do \u201c[i]f\nthe date for a prisoner\u2019s release falls on a Saturday, a\nSunday, or a legal holiday.\u201d \u00a73624(a). This legislative\nspecificity as to timing contrasts with other provisions\nthat do delegate authority to BOP. E.g., \u00a73624(b)(1)\n(awarding of credit is \u201csubject to determination\u201d by BOP\nthat the prisoner \u201chas displayed exemplary compliance\nwith institutional disciplinary regulations\u201d).\n   BOP has not claimed that its view is the product of any\n\u201cformal administrative procedure tending to foster the\nfairness and deliberation that should underlie a pro\nnouncement\u201d with the force of law. United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 230 (2001). In 2005, BOP made final\nan administrative rule adopting its preferred methodology.\n70 Fed. Reg. 66752 (adopting 28 CFR \u00a7523.20). But when\npressed during an earlier stage of this litigation, BOP\nconceded that it had \u201cfailed to articulate in the adminis\ntrative record the rationale upon which it relied when it\npromulgated\u201d the rule. Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800,\n805 (CA9 2008). The Court of Appeals accepted BOP\u2019s\nconcession, ibid., and that aspect of its ruling has not been\nappealed.\n   As a fallback position, the Government argues that\nBOP\u2019s interpretation should receive at least some defer\nence under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944).\nBut under Skidmore, an agency decision only merits \u201cre\nspect proportional to its \u2018power to persuade.\u2019 \u201d Mead,\nsupra, at 235 (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140). BOP\u2019s\nposition is of long standing, but the administrative record\nis noteworthy for what it does not contain\u2014namely, any\nreasoned justification for preferring BOP\u2019s methodology\nover statutorily permissible alternatives. BOP has consis\ntently adhered to its mistaken belief that its approach is\nthe only one that can be squared with the text. See 62\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

THOMAS, WARDEN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 09\u20135201. Argued March 30, 2010\u2014Decided June 7, 2010\nThe federal sentencing statute at issue provides that a \u201cprisoner . . .\n  serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year . . . may receive\n  credit toward the service of [that] sentence . . . of up to 54 days at the\n  end of each year\u201d subject to the Bureau of Prison\u2019s (BOP) \u201cdetermina\n  tion . . . that, during that year, the prisoner\u201d has behaved in an ex\n  emplary fashion. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73624(b)(1). Credit \u201cfor the last year or\n  portion of a year of the term of imprisonment [is] prorated . . . .\u201d Ibid.\n  The BOP applies this statute using a methodology that awards 54\n  days of credit at the end of each year the prisoner serves and sets\n  those days to the side. When the difference between the time re\n  maining in the sentence and the amount of accumulated credit is less\n  than one year, the BOP awards a prorated amount of credit for that\n  final year proportional to the awards in other years.\n     Petitioners claim that the BOP\u2019s calculation method is unlawful\n  because \u00a73624(b)(1) requires a calculation based on the length of the\n  term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge, not the\n  length of time that the prisoner actually serves. The District Court\n  rejected this challenge in each of petitioner\u2019s cases, and the Ninth\n  Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Because the BOP\u2019s method for calculating good time credit re\n flects the most natural reading of the statute, it is lawful. Pp. 5\u201317.\n    (a) The statute\u2019s language and purpose, taken together, support the\n BOP\u2019s method. That method tracks \u00a73624(b)\u2019s language by providing\n a prisoner a maximum credit of 54 days for each full year of impris\n onment and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for any addi\n tional time served that is less than a full year. As \u00a73624(b) directs,\n the BOP awards the credit \u201cat the end of each year\u201d of imprisonment.\n Petitioners\u2019 approach cannot be reconciled with the statute. Because\n2                          BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    it awards credit for the sentence imposed, regardless of how much\n    time is actually served, a prisoner could receive credit for a year that\n    he does not spend in prison. Moreover the calculation of credit for\n    such a year would not be made \u201cat the end of\u201d that year. Nor could\n    the BOP determine whether the prisoner had exemplary behavior\n    \u201cduring that year.\u201d This language did not find its way into the stat\n    ute by accident. The differences between the prior provision (re\n    pealed in 1984)\u2014which granted the prisoner a deduction at the out\n    set of his sentence, subject to forfeiture for breaking prison rules\u2014\n    and the present statute\u2014under which \u201ccredit\u201d is \u201cearned\u201d \u201cat the end\n    of\u201d the year based on an evaluation of behavior \u201cduring that year\u201d\u2014\n    show an intent to move from a prospective entitlement to a retrospec\n    tive award. The BOP\u2019s method also furthers the basic purpose of the\n    statute. Section 3624 was part of the comprehensive Sentencing Re\n    form Act of 1984, which sought to achieve both increased sentencing\n    uniformity and greater honesty by \u201cmak[ing] all sentences basically\n    determinate.\u201d Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367. There\n    after, the sentence the judge imposed would be the one the offender\n    actually served, with a sole statutory exception for good time credits.\n    Ibid. Section 3624(b) states the reason for the exception: to provide\n    an incentive for prisoners to \u201ccompl[y] with institutional disciplinary\n    regulations.\u201d The exception is limited and tailored to its purpose\u2014\n    credit is earned at the end of the year after compliance with institu\n    tional rules is demonstrated and thereby rewards and reinforces a\n    readily identifiable period of good behavior. The BOP\u2019s approach fur\n    thers \u00a73624\u2019s objectives by tying the award directly to good behavior\n    during the preceding year. In contrast, petitioners\u2019 approach would\n    allow a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion of his sentence\n    that he served and the portion offset with earned credit, which would\n    loosen the statute\u2019s connection between good behavior and the good\n    time award. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) Arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. Context indicates\n    that the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d as used in the portion of\n    \u00a73624(b) at issue here refers to prison time actually served not, as pe\n    titioners contend, to the sentence imposed by the judge. Petitioners\u2019\n    reliance on legislative history is misplaced. A U. S. Sentencing Com\n    mission Supplementary Report is not helpful to them either, because\n    there is no indication that the Commission, in that report or in the\n    Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the particular ques\n    tion whether to base good time credit on time served or the sentence\n    imposed. Nor, in light of the statute\u2019s text, structure, history, and\n    purpose, is this a case in which there is a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or un\n    certainty in the statute,\u201d Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125,\n    139, permitting application of the rule of lenity. Because the BOP\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

Cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re\n  sources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 844\u2013845. And because\n  the BOP\u2019s approach reflects the statute\u2019s most natural reading and is\n  the most consistent with its purpose, it is also preferable to the dis\n  sent\u2019s alternative interpretation.

S. C. \u00a73624(b). Petition\ners, two federal prisoners, challenge the method that the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons uses for calculating this \u201cgood\ntime credit.\u201d We conclude that the Bureau\u2019s method re\nflects the most natural reading of the statute, and we\nreject petitioners\u2019 legal challenge.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  A federal sentencing statute provides: \n\n    \u201c[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year . . . may receive credit toward the\n    service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence, beyond the time\n    served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the\n    prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end\n    of the first year of the term . . . . [C]redit for the last\n    year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment\n    shall be prorated and credited within the last six\n    weeks of the sentence.\u201d \u00a73624(b)(1).\n2                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons (BOP) applies this statute using a\nmethodology that petitioners in this case challenge as\nunlawful. In order to explain the BOP method, we shall\nuse a simplified example that captures its essential ele\nments. The unsimplified calculations described by the\nBOP in its policy statement, see App. 96\u2013100, will reach\napproximately the same results as, and are essentially the\nmathematical equivalent of, the simplified system we\ndescribe (there may be other ways to describe the calcula\ntion as well). To the extent that there are any differences\nbetween the methodology employed by the BOP and that\nreflected in our example, they are of no consequence to the\nresolution of petitioners\u2019 challenge and are therefore not\nbefore us. Similarly, although petitioners committed their\ncrimes before the current version of \u00a73624 was enacted\nand are therefore subject to a previous version that dif\nfered slightly in certain details, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a73624\n(1988 ed.), the differences between the two versions are\nimmaterial to the questions presented by this case. The\nparties refer to the current version as the relevant provi\nsion of law, see Brief for Petitioners 2\u20133; Brief for Respon\ndent 8, n. 2, and we shall do the same.\n   In our example we shall imagine a prisoner who has\nreceived a sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. We shall\nassume that his behavior throughout his confinement is\nexemplary and that prison authorities will consequently\nconsider him to merit the maximum good time credit that\nthe statute will allow. And we shall ignore leap years.\n   Thus, at the end of the first year (Year 1) that prisoner\nwould earn the statute\u2019s maximum credit of 54 days. The\nrelevant official (whom we shall call the \u201cgood time calcu\nlator\u201d) would note that fact and, in effect, preliminarily\nput the 54 days to the side. At the end of Year 2 the pris\noner would earn an additional 54 days of good time credit.\nThe good time calculator would add this 54 days to the\nfirst 54 days, note the provisional total of 108 days, and\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagain put the 108 days\u2019 credit to the side. By the end of\nYear 8, the prisoner would have earned a total of 432 days\nof good time credit (8 years times 54 days). At that time,\nthe good time calculator would note that the difference\nbetween the time remaining in the sentence (2 years, or\n730 days) and the amount of accumulated good time credit\n(432 days) is less than 1 year (730 minus 432 equals 298\ndays, which is less than 365). The 432 days of good time\ncredit that the prisoner has earned by the end of Year 8\nare sufficient to wipe out all of the last year of the 10-year\nprison term and to shorten the prisoner\u2019s 9th year of im\nprisonment by 67 days.\n   Year 9 of the sentence will consequently become the\nprisoner\u2019s last year of imprisonment. Further, because the\nprisoner has already earned 67 days of credit against that\nyear (432 days already earned minus 365 days applied to\nYear 10 leaves 67 days to apply to Year 9), the prisoner\nwill have no more than 298 days left to serve in Year 9.\nNow the good time calculator will have to work out just\nhow much good time the prisoner can earn, and credit\nagainst, these remaining 298 days.\n   As we said, the statute provides that \u201cgood time\u201d for this\n\u201clast year or portion\u201d thereof shall be \u201cprorated.\u201d Thus,\nthe good time calculator must divide the 298 days into two\nparts: (1) days that the prisoner will have to serve in\nprison, and (2) credit for good behavior the prisoner will\nearn during the days served in Year 9. In other words, the\nnumber of days to be served in Year 9 plus the number of\ngood time credit days earned will be equal to the number\nof days left in the sentence, namely, 298. And to keep the\naward of credit in the last year proportional to awards in\nother years, the ratio of these two parts of Year 9 (i.e., the\nnumber of good time days divided by the number of days\nserved) must be 54/365, the same ratio that the BOP\napplies to full years served. We can use some elementary\nalgebra, described in the Appendix, infra, to work out the\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrest. The result is that if the prisoner serves 260 days, he\ncan earn an additional 38 days of credit for good behavior.\nThat is to say, of the 298 days remaining in his sentence,\nthe prisoner will have to serve 260 days in confinement,\nafter which point, his sentence will be fully accounted for\n(given the additional 38 days\u2019 credit earned), and he will\nbe released. In sum, a prisoner subject to a 10-year\n(3,650-day) sentence who earns the maximum number of\ndays the statute permits will serve 3,180 days in confine\nment and receive 470 days of \u201cgood time\u201d credit, about\n15% of the prison time actually served.\n                               B\n   In this case petitioners claim that the BOP\u2019s calculation\nmethod is unlawful. They say that \u00a73624(b)(1) (2006 ed.)\nrequires a straightforward calculation based upon the\nlength of the term of imprisonment that the sentencing\njudge imposes, not the length of time that the prisoner\nactually serves. Thus, if a sentencing judge imposes a\nprison term of 10 years (as in our example), then, in peti\ntioners\u2019 view, the statute permits a maximum good time\naward of 540 days (10 years times 54 days), not the 470\ndays that the method described above would allow. And if\nthe judge imposes a prison term of 10 years and 6 months,\nthen the statute permits 567 days (540 days for the 10\nyears plus 27 days for the extra 6 months), not the 494\ndays that the method above would allow. According to\npetitioners, the BOP\u2019s method causes model prisoners to\nlose seven days of good time credit per year of imprison\nment, and because their sentences are fairly long (one,\nMichael Barber, was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months;\nthe other, Tahir Jihad-Black, was sentenced to 21 years\nand 10 months), the difference in their cases amounts to\nseveral months of additional prison time.\n   The District Court in each of these cases rejected the\nprisoner\u2019s challenge.

Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800 (CA9 2008).\nBecause the BOP\u2019s administration of good time credits\naffects the interests of a large number of federal prisoners,\nwe granted the consolidated petition for certiorari to con\nsider petitioners\u2019 challenge.\n                              II\n   Having now considered petitioners\u2019 arguments, we\nconclude that that we must reject their legal challenge.\nThe statute\u2019s language and its purpose, taken together,\nconvince us that the BOP\u2019s calculation method is lawful.\nFor one thing, that method tracks the language of\n\u00a73624(b). That provision says that a prisoner (serving a\nsentence of imprisonment of more than a year and less\nthan life) \u201cmay receive credit . . . of up to 54 days at the\nend of each year\u201d subject to the \u201cdetermination by the\nBureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner\u201d has\nbehaved in an exemplary fashion. Ibid. (emphasis added).\nAnd it says that credit for the \u201clast year or portion of a\nyear . . . shall be prorated and credited within the last six\nweeks of the sentence.\u201d Ibid. As the example in Part I\nmakes clear, the BOP\u2019s interpretation provides a prisoner\nentitled to a maximum annual credit with 54 days of good\ntime credit for each full year of imprisonment that he\nserves and a proportionally adjusted amount of credit for\nany additional time served that is less than a full year.\nAnd, as \u00a73624(b) directs, the BOP awards the credit at the\nend of each year of imprisonment (except, of course, for\nYear 9, which is subject to the statute\u2019s special instruction\nrequiring proration and crediting during the last six weeks\nof the sentence).\n   We are unable similarly to reconcile petitioners\u2019 ap\n6                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproach with the statute. Their system awards credit for\nthe sentence imposed, regardless of how much time is\nactually served. Thus, a prisoner under petitioners\u2019 sys\ntem could receive 54 days of credit for Year 10 despite the\nfact that he would be released after less than 81\u20442 years in\nprison. The good time calculation for Year 10 would not be\nmade \u201cat the end of\u201d Year 10 (nor within the last six weeks\nof a sentence ending during that year). Neither could the\nBOP determine whether the prisoner had behaved in\nexemplary fashion \u201cduring that year.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73624(b)\n(emphasis added); see also White v.

The \u201cgood time\u201d provision in\n\u00a73624 is part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98\nStat. 1987, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991\u2013\n998, a comprehensive law that reformed federal sentenc\ning practice and directed the newly created United States\nSentencing Commission \u201cto devise guidelines to be used\nfor sentencing\u201d in district courts, Mistretta v. United\nStates, 488 U. S. 361, 367 (1989). Under the previous\nregime, the United States Parole Commission, \u201cas a gen\neral rule, [could] conditionally release a prisoner any time\nafter he serve[d] one-third of the judicially fixed term.\u201d\nUnited States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 47 (1978). If, for\nexample, a judge imposed a prison term of 15 years, the\nParole Commission might have released the prisoner after\nonly 5 years. And it routinely did so. See United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a71A3, p. s., p.\n1.2 (Oct. 1987) (USSG) (\u201c[D]efendants often serv[ed] only\nabout one-third of the sentence handed down by the\ncourt\u201d). The result was \u201cconfusion and implicit deception.\u201d\nIbid. With the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress sought to\nachieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater\nhonesty by \u201cmak[ing] all sentences basically determinate,\u201d\nMistretta, supra, at 367. See USSG \u00a71A3, p. s., at 1.2\n(statutory objectives included \u201chonesty in sentencing,\u201d\n\u201cuniformity,\u201d and \u201cproportionality\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n   Thereafter, the sentence the judge imposed would be the\nsentence the offender actually served, with a sole statutory\nexception for good time credits. Mistretta, supra, at 367 (a\n\u201cprisoner is to be released at the completion of his sen\ntence reduced only by any credit earned by good behavior\nwhile in custody\u201d (citing \u00a73624(b)). The reason for this\nexception is provided in \u00a73624(b) itself: to provide an\nincentive for prisoners to \u201ccompl[y] with institutional\ndisciplinary regulations.\u201d The good time exception is\nlimited (to 54 days per year) and tailored to its purpose\u2014\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncredit is earned at the end of the year after compliance\nwith institutional rules is demonstrated and thereby\nrewards and reinforces a readily identifiable period of good\nbehavior.\n   The BOP\u2019s approach furthers the objective of \u00a73624. It\nties the award of good time credits directly to good behav\nior during the preceding year of imprisonment. By con\ntrast, petitioners\u2019 approach, insofar is it would award up to\n54 days per year of time sentenced as opposed to time\nserved, allows a prisoner to earn credit for both the portion\nof his sentence that he serves and the portion of his sen\ntence that he offsets with earned good time credit. In\nother words, petitioners argue that the BOP should award\ngood time credit not only for the days a prisoner spends in\nprison and behaves appropriately, but also for days that\nhe will not spend in prison at all, such as Year 10 in our\nexample. By doing so, it loosens the statute\u2019s connection\nbetween good behavior and the award of good time and\ntransforms the nature of the exception to the basic sen\ntence-imposed-is-sentence-served rule. And to that extent,\nit is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s basic purpose.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  We are not convinced by petitioners\u2019 several arguments\nagainst the BOP\u2019s methodology. First, petitioners point to\nthe statement in \u00a73624(b) that a prisoner \u201cmay receive\ncredit . . . at the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s term of\nimprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The words \u201cterm of\nimprisonment,\u201d they say, must refer to the years of the\nterm that the sentencing judge imposed (10 years in our\nexample), not the (less-than-10) years of the term that the\nprisoner actually served once good time credits were taken\ninto account. After all, the very first phrase of that provi\nsion makes eligible for good time credits \u201ca prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nthan a term of imprisonment for the duration of the pris\noner\u2019s life.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The\nwords \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d in this phrase almost cer\ntainly refer to the sentence imposed, not to the time actu\nally served (otherwise prisoners sentenced to a year and a\nday would become ineligible for credit as soon as they\nearned it). And, as petitioners emphasize, we have recog\nnized a \u201cpresumption that a given term is used to mean\nthe same thing throughout a statute,\u201d Brown v. Gardner,\n513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n  The problem for petitioners, however, is that this pre\nsumption is not absolute. It yields readily to indications\nthat the same phrase used in different parts of the same\nstatute means different things, particularly where the\nphrase is one that speakers can easily use in different\nways without risk of confusion. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers,\nInc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932); General\nDynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581, 595\u2013\n596 (2004). See, e.g., id., at 596\u2013597 (\u201cage\u201d has different\nmeanings in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.,\n532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) (same for \u201c \u2018wages paid\u2019 \u201d in the\nInternal Revenue Code); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519\nU. S. 337, 343\u2013344 (1997) (same for \u201cemployee\u201d in Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).\n  The phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d is just such a\nphrase. It can refer to the sentence that the judge im\nposes, see, e.g., \u00a73624(a) (\u201cA prisoner shall be released\u201d at\nthe end of \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, less any\ntime credited\u201d for good behavior), but it also can refer to\nthe time that the prisoner actually serves. Thus, \u00a73624(d)\nof the statute before us requires BOP to \u201cfurnish [a] pris\noner with . . . suitable clothing[,] . . . money, . . . and . . .\ntransportation\u201d \u201c[u]pon the release of [the] prisoner on the\nexpiration of the prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d (Em\nphasis added.) The statute here means to assure that the\n10                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprisoner is provided with these necessities at the time of\nhis actual release from prison (sometime during Year 9 in\nour example), not at the end of the term that the judge\nimposed (which would be over a year later). Since the\nstatute uses the same phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d in\ntwo different ways, the presumption cannot help petition\ners here. And, for the reasons we have given, see Part II,\nsupra, context here indicates that the particular instance\nof the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d at issue refers to\nprison time actually served rather than the sentence\nimposed by the judge.\n   Second, petitioners seek to draw support from the stat\nute\u2019s legislative history. But those who consider legisla\ntive history significant cannot find that history helpful to\npetitioners here. Petitioners point, for example, to a\nstatement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sen\ntencing Reform Act, which says that the \u201cmethod of calcu\nlation\u201d of good time \u201cwill be considerably less complicated\nthan under current law in many respects,\u201d and that \u201ccredit\ntoward early release is earned at a steady and easily\ndetermined rate that will have an obvious impact on the\nprisoner\u2019s release date.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 146\u2013147\n(1983); see Brief for Petitioners 31\u201332. But these state\nments are consistent with the BOP\u2019s interpretation of the\nstatute. Its method, as we understand it, is not particu\nlarly difficult to apply and it is certainly less complex than\nprior law, which provided for the accumulation of two\ndifferent kinds of good time credit (general and industrial),\ncalculated in different manners (prospectively and retro\nspectively), and awarded at different rates, depending on\nthe length of sentence imposed on the prisoner (5 to 10\ndays per month for general) or the year of employment (3\nor 5 days per month for industrial). See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a74161, 4162 (1982 ed.).\n   Petitioners also point to various statements contained in\nthe Act\u2019s Conference Report and made by individual legis\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlators that describe good time credit as providing sentence\nreductions of 15%. See Brief for Petitioners 34\u201336 (citing,\ne.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98\u20131159, p. 415 (1984); 131\nCong. Rec. 488 (1985) (remarks of Rep. Hamilton)). But\nthere is nothing in the context of these statements to\nsuggest that they amounted to anything other than rough\napproximations or that they were made with the present\ncontroversy in mind. See, e.g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98\u2013\n1159, at 415 (noting simply that an increase in the amount\nof maximum annual credit from 36 days to 54 days \u201cin\ncreases \u2018good time\u2019 that accrues from 10 percent to 15\npercent\u201d); 131 Cong. Rec. 488 (1985) (statement of Rep.\nHamilton) (\u201cUnder [pre-Sentencing Reform Act] law, about\n80% of all criminals are paroled after serving one third of\ntheir time. Now sentences will be reduced only 15% for\ngood behavior\u201d). And whatever interpretive force one\nattaches to legislative history, the Court normally gives\nlittle weight to statements, such as those of the individual\nlegislators, made after the bill in question has become law.\nSee, e.g., Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U. S. 291, 298 (1995).\n   Third, petitioners rely on a statement in the United\nStates Sentencing Commission\u2019s Supplementary Report on\nthe Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements\nissued in 1987 (hereinafter Supplementary Report). In\nthat Report, the Commission summarized its analysis of\nrecent pre-Guidelines sentencing practice, which it had\nused to help draft the Guidelines. The results of the\nanalysis were presented in a table that permits compari\nson of the likely prison-time consequences of the new\nGuidelines with prison time actually served under pre-\nGuidelines practice (specifically, by identifying the Guide\nlines \u201coffense level that is closest to the average time . . .\nserved by first-time offenders\u201d convicted of a particular\ncrime, Supplementary Report 23). Because the Guidelines\n\u201crefer to sentences prior to the awarding of good time\u201d (i.e.,\nbecause a Guidelines sentence of, say, 30 months\u2019 impris\n12                 BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nonment does not necessarily mean that the offender will\nserve the entire 30 months in prison), the Commission\nadjusted the average time served \u201cby dividing by 0.85 good\ntime when the term exceeded 12 months.\u201d Ibid. This\nadjustment, the Commission explained, \u201cmade sentences\nin the [t]able comparable with those in the guidelines.\u201d\nIbid.\n   Pointing to this adjustment and a reference in later\neditions of the Guidelines to a potential credit of \u201cap\nproximately fifteen percent for good behavior,\u201d see, e.g.,\nUSSG \u00a71A3, p. s., at 3 (Nov. 2009), petitioners maintain\nthat the Commission set its Guideline ranges with the\nexpectation that well-behaved prisoners would receive\ngood time credit of up to 15% of the sentence imposed, not\n15% of the time actually served. They add that, in setting\nthe Guidelines ranges in this way, the Commission exer\ncised congressionally delegated power to interpret the\nSentencing Reform Act, see Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 371\u2013\n379 (approving Congress\u2019 delegation of the power to prom\nulgate sentencing guidelines), and that as long as that\ninterpretation is reasonable, courts must defer to it. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\ncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843\u2013844 (1984).\n   Again, however, we can find no indication that the\nCommission, in writing its Supplementary Report or in\nthe Guidelines themselves, considered or referred to the\nparticular question here before us, that is whether good\ntime credit is to be based on time served or the sentence\nimposed. The Guidelines Manual itself, a more authorita\ntive account of the Commission\u2019s interpretive views than\nthe Supplementary Report, says nothing directly on that\nsubject. Moreover, with respect to comparisons between\nGuidelines sentences and pre-Guidelines practice, the\noriginal 1987 Manual cautioned that the Guidelines did\nnot \u201csimply cop[y] estimates of existing practice as re\nvealed by the data,\u201d but rather \u201cdeparted from the data at\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndifferent points for various important reasons.\u201d USSG\n\u00a71A3, p. s., at 1.4; see also id., \u00a71A4(g), p. s., at 1.11\n(while \u201cGuideline sentences in many instances will ap\nproximate existing [i.e., pre-Guidelines] practice,\u201d the\nCommission did \u201cnot conside[r] itself bound by existing\nsentencing practice\u201d (emphasis added)). Because the\nCommission has expressed no view on the question before\nus, we need not decide whether it would be entitled to\ndeference had it done so. If it turns out that the calcula\ntion of good time credit based on prison time served rather\nthan the sentence imposed produces results that are more\nsevere than the Commission finds appropriate, the Com\nmission remains free to adjust sentencing levels accord\ningly. See id., \u00a71A2, at 1.2 (acknowledging that \u201cthe\nguideline-writing process is evolutionary\u201d and that the\nCommission functions \u201cas a permanent agency to monitor\nsentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the\nnation\u201d).\n   Fourth, petitioners ask us to invoke the rule of lenity\nand construe \u00a73624 (2006 ed.) in their favor, that is, in a\nway that will maximize the amount of available good time\ncredit. We may assume for present purposes that \u00a73624(b)\ncan be construed as imposing a criminal penalty. See\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980) (rule of\nlenity applies to \u201cinterpretations of . . . the penalties\u201d\nimposed by \u201ccriminal prohibitions\u201d); but see Sash v. Zenk,\n428 F. 3d 132, 134 (CA2 2005) (Sotomayor, J.) (holding\nthat \u00a73624(b) is not a criminal statute for the purposes of\nthe rule of lenity). Even so, the rule of lenity only applies\nif, after considering text, structure, history, and purpose,\nthere remains a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the\nstatute,\u201d Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 139\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), such that the\nCourt must simply \u201c \u2018guess as to what Congress intended.\u2019 \u201d\nBifulco, supra, at 387 (quoting Ladner v. United States,\n358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958)). See United States v. Hayes,\n14                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 13); United States v.\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305\u2013306 (1992) (plurality opinion).\nHaving so considered the statute, we do not believe that\nthere remains a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty\u201d in the\nstatutory provision before us. Nor need we now simply\n\u201cguess\u201d what the statute means.\n  Finally, we note that petitioners urge us not to defer to\nthe BOP\u2019s implementation of \u00a73624(b). In our view, the\nBOP\u2019s calculation system applies that statute as its lan\nguage is most naturally read, and in accordance with what\nthat language makes clear is its basic purpose. No one\ndoubts that the BOP has the legal power to implement the\nstatute in accordance with its language and purposes;\nhence we need not determine the extent to which Congress\nhas granted the BOP authority to interpret the statute\nmore broadly, or differently than it has done here. Cf.\nChevron, supra, at 844\u2013845.\n                              B\n  Acknowledging that petitioners\u2019 arguments cannot carry\nthe day, the dissent has proposed a \u201cthird possibility,\u201d\npost, at 2 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.), not raised by either\nparty nor, to our knowledge, used elsewhere in the Crimi\nnal Code. The dissent reads the statutory phrase \u201cterm of\nimprisonment\u201d to refer to \u201cthe administrative period along\nwhich progress toward eventual freedom is marked.\u201d Post,\nat 3. It derives from this reading the following method of\ncalculation as applied to our 10-year example. First, \u201c[t]he\nsentence is divided into 10 365-day segments.\u201d Ibid. At\nthe end of the first segment, a prisoner may receive up to\n54 days of credit for good behavior. These credits immedi\nately \u201cgo toward completion of the next year\u201d so that the\nprisoner need only serve \u201canother 311 days behind bars\nbefore the second year of his term of imprisonment is at an\nend.\u201d Ibid. This process repeats itself until the \u201c10th\nsegment,\u201d in which a prisoner receives an unspecified\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201ccredit in a prorated amount.\u201d Ibid. In the end, the pris\noner will have served 10 \u201cadministrative segments,\u201d ibid.,\ncollectively comprising 3,117 days in prison and 533 days\nof credit.\n   The dissent claims \u201c[r]eading \u2018term of imprisonment\u2019\nthis way is consistent with all parts of the statute.\u201d Post,\nat 4. We see at least four problems. First, the opening\nsentence of \u00a73624(a) instructs that \u201c[a] prisoner shall be\nreleased\u201d upon \u201cthe expiration of the prisoner\u2019s term of\nimprisonment, less any time credited\u201d for good behavior.\nBut if a prisoner\u2019s \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d is the \u201cperiod\nthat a prisoner must complete in order to earn his free\ndom,\u201d post, at 4, and it is \u201caccounted for through a combi\nnation of prison time and credits,\u201d post, at 3, then a pris\noner should be released exactly at the end of his term of\nimprisonment (without any further adjustment). Because\nthe dissent\u2019s approach would require us to read words out\nof the statute, or give prisoners double credit, its definition\ncannot be used here.\n   Second, \u00a73624(b)(1) tells us that a prisoner receives\ncredit \u201cat the end of each year\u201d based on behavior \u201cduring\nthat year.\u201d Under the dissent\u2019s approach, however, a\nprisoner may receive credit at the end of each \u201cadministra\ntive segmen[t]\u201d presumably based on his behavior during\nthat segment. And because an \u201cadministrative segmen[t]\u201d\nis made up of some \u201ccombination of service and credits,\u201d\npost, at 4, each one lasts less than a calendar year. We do\nnot see how a system in which \u201ca prisoner may complete a\nparticular year of his term in less than 365 calendar days,\u201d\nibid., and receive full good time credit for doing so, can\npossibly represent the most natural reading of this statu\ntory language. Nor do we know, because the BOP has not\nhad an opportunity to tell us, whether a system in which a\n\u201cyear\u201d lasts anywhere from 311 to 365 calendar days (and\nin which the \u201cyears\u201d of a single prisoner\u2019s sentence may all\nbe of different lengths), is easily administrable. (We doubt\n16                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat this system will be more comprehensible to prisoners\nthan one, like the BOP\u2019s, that provides credit for actual\nyears.)\n   Third, under the dissent\u2019s approach, credit is earned at\ndifferent rates during a single sentence. For the first\n\u201cadministrative segmen[t]\u201d in its 10-year example, the\nprisoner serves 365 days and earns 54 days of credit. The\nratio of credit earned to days served is .148. For the sec\nond \u201cadministrative segmen[t],\u201d the prisoner serves 311\ndays and earns 54 days of credit. This time, the ratio of\ncredit earned to days served is .174. (For the last \u201cadmin\nistrative segmen[t],\u201d the dissent tells us the prisoner will\nreceive \u201ccredit in a prorated amount,\u201d but it does not tell\nus which ratio should be used for the proration. Post, at\n3.) The use of different rates finds no support in the stat\nute. The dissent objects that the statute \u201cprescribes no\nparticular rate,\u201d post, at 7, but in fact it does\u201454 days of\ncredit per year of good behavior\u2014and it further requires\nthat credit for the last year be \u201cprorated\u201d using the same\nproportion. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s application of different\nrates leads to odd results. For example, a model prisoner\nsentenced on two separate 5-year terms (with a break in\nbetween) will serve a different number of days from one\nsentenced to a single 10-year term. How can this be if\nboth prisoners are earning 54 days of credit for each of\ntheir 10 years in prison?\n   Fourth, \u00a73624(b)(2) provides that good time credit \u201cshall\nvest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.\u201d\n(This provision does not apply to prisoners, like petition\ners, who committed their offenses before it was amended\nin 1996, but the dissent plainly intends for its approach to\napply more broadly. See post, at 9 (noting the effect on\n\u201calmost 200,000 federal prisoners\u201d).) Yet under the dis\nsent\u2019s approach, credit appears to vest immediately.

And if it does\nnot, then the situation quickly becomes complicated.\nWhat happens if, say, on the last day of the 10th \u201cadminis\ntrative segmen[t]\u201d (somewhere in the 8th calendar year), a\nprisoner badly misbehaves and prison officials punish him\nby taking away all of his previously earned credit? Cf. 28\nCFR \u00a7541.13 (2009) (prescribing sanctions for prohibited\nacts). Does the BOP retroactively adjust the duration of\nall of his administrative segments to 365 days so that the\nprisoner now finds himself in the middle of the 8th \u201cad\nministrative segmen[t]\u201d? (Again we do not know if the\nBOP would find such a system administrable, and we\ndoubt that this system would be more comprehensible to a\nprisoner.) If so, does the prisoner have a second opportu\nnity to earn credit for good behavior for the 9th \u201cadminis\ntrative segmen[t]\u201d that he had previously completed but\nnow must account for again? Cf. \u00a73624(b)(1) (\u201cCredit that\nhas not been earned may not later be granted\u201d). Or, hav\ning previously awarded (and taken away) credit for that\nsegment, are prison authorities left without any incentive\nto offer for good behavior?\n  Finally, the dissent, like petitioners, invokes the rule of\nlenity to support its interpretation. But, the best efforts of\nthe dissent notwithstanding, we still see no \u201cgrievous\nambiguity or uncertainty\u201d that would trigger the rule\u2019s\napplication. We remain convinced that the BOP\u2019s ap\nproach reflects the most natural reading of the statutory\nlanguage and the most consistent with its purpose. What\never the merits of the dissent\u2019s policy arguments, the\nstatute does not require the BOP to accept them.\n\n For all of these reasons, we conclude that the BOP\u2019s\nmethodology is lawful. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment is\n\n                                                    Affirmed.\n18                   BARBER v.

At the end of Year 8, the prisoner\nhas 2 years remaining in his sentence and has accumu\nlated 432 days of good time credit. Because the difference\nbetween the time remaining in his sentence and the\namount of accumulated credit (i.e., 730 - 432) is less than a\nyear (298 days), Year 9 is the last year he will spend in\nprison. (Year 10 has been completely offset by 365 of the\n432 days of accumulated credit.) Further, Year 9 will be a\npartial year of 298 days (the other 67 days of the year\nbeing offset by the remainder of the accumulated credit).\n   Here is where the elementary algebra comes in. We\nknow that x, the good time, plus y, the remaining time\nserved, must add up to 298. This gives us our first equa\ntion: x + y = 298.\n   We also know that the ratio of good time earned in the\nportion of the final year to the amount of time served in\nthat year must equal the ratio of a full year\u2019s good time\ncredit to the amount of time served in a full year. The\nlatter ratio is 54/365 or .148. Thus, we know that\nx/y = .148, or to put it another way, x = .148y. Because we\nknow the value of x in terms of y, we can make a substitu\ntion in our first equation to get .148y + y = 298. We then\nadd the two y terms together (1.148y = 298), and we solve\nfor y, which gives us y = 260. Now we can plug that value\ninto our first equation to solve for x (the good time credit).\nIf we subtract 260 from 298, we find that x = 38.\n   The offender will have to serve 260 days in prison in\nYear 9, and he will receive 38 days additional good time\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The prisoner\u2019s total good time\nis 470 days (432 + 38 = 470). His total time served is 3180\ndays.\n   As a final matter, while we have described the foregoing\nas the method to calculate credit for the portion of the last\nyear to more transparently track the relevant statutory\nlanguage, we note that the mathematical formula can be\nused to calculate the amount of maximum available credit\nfor an entire sentence. Using the equations supplied\nabove, if we divide the total number of days in a sentence\nby 1.148, we get the minimum number of days that a\ndefendant must serve in that sentence. If we then sub\ntract the number of days served from the total number of\ndays in the sentence, we arrive at the maximum number\nof good time credit days the prisoner can earn. The stat\nute, however, awards them on a yearly basis (but for the\n\u201clast year or portion\u201d thereof).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

See Pet. for Cert. 11, and n. 2. It adopts this\nreading despite the existence of an alternative interpreta\ntion that is more consistent with the statute\u2019s text. Absent\na clear congressional directive, the statute ought not to be\nread as the Court reads it. For the Court\u2019s interpreta\ntion\u2014an interpretation that in my submission is quite\nincorrect\u2014imposes tens of thousands of years of additional\nprison time on federal prisoners according to a mathe\nmatical formula they will be unable to understand. And if\nthe only way to call attention to the human implications of\nthis case is to speak in terms of economics, then it should\nbe noted that the Court\u2019s interpretation comes at a cost to\nthe taxpayers of untold millions of dollars. See id., at 11.\nThe interpretation the Court adopts, moreover, will be\ndevastating to the prisoners who have behaved the best\nand will undermine the purpose of the statute. These\nconsiderations, and those stated below, require this re\nspectful dissent.\n                            I\n  The federal sentencing statute at issue here provides:\n2                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n    \u201c[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of\n    more than 1 year[,] other than a term of imprisonment\n    for the duration of the prisoner\u2019s life, may receive\n    credit toward the service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence,\n    beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of\n    each year of the prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, be\n    ginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject\n    to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, dur\n    ing that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary\n    compliance with institutional disciplinary regula\n    tions. . . . [C]redit for the last year or portion of a year\n    of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and\n    credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.\u201d 18\n    U. S. C. \u00a73624(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nAccording to the Court, the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d\nmust mean \u201ctime actually served\u201d the third time that it\nappears in this particular subsection. But the Court gives\nthe phrase a different interpretation the first two times it\nis used in the very same sentence. This in itself indicates\nthat something is quite wrong here.\n   Petitioners invite the Court to read \u201cterm of imprison\nment\u201d to mean \u201cthe sentence imposed.\u201d This, too, seems\nunworkable. And it can be acknowledged that the Court\u2019s\nrejection of this interpretation is correct.\n   The choice, however, is not just between the Court\u2019s\nreading and that offered by petitioners. There is a third\npossibility, one more consistent with the statute than\neither of these two alternatives.\n   A fair reading of the statute, and a necessary reading to\naccomplish its purpose best, is to interpret the phrase\n\u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d to refer to the span of time that a\nprisoner must account for in order to obtain release. The\nlength of the term is set at the outset by the criminal\nsentence imposed. The prisoner earns release when that\nterm has been fully completed. Most of the term will be\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsatisfied through time spent behind bars. Assuming the\nprisoner is well behaved, however, he may earn good time\ncredits along the way; and those credits may substitute for\nactual prison time. Each year of the term comprises a full\n365 days, which must be accounted for through a combina\ntion of prison time and credits. Thus conceived, a pris\noner\u2019s \u201cterm\u201d is the administrative period along which\nprogress toward eventual freedom is marked.\n   Consider the Court\u2019s example of a prisoner subject to a\nten-year sentence. See ante, at 2\u20134. The sentence is\ndivided into ten 365-day segments. Each segment consti\ntutes a year of the term. The prisoner will spend the first\n365 days behind bars. In the statute\u2019s words, he has\nreached \u201cthe end of the first year of the term.\u201d Now is the\ntime for credit to be awarded, and he may receive up to 54\ndays if sufficiently well behaved. Because he has already\ncompleted a full year of his term, those credits go toward\ncompletion of the next year. If, based on good behavior, he\nhas earned the maximum of 54 days, he would need an\nother 311 days behind bars before the second year of his\nterm of imprisonment is at an end (because 54 + 311 =\n365). If he has earned fewer than 54 days, a longer incar\nceration will be required to reach 365. Regardless, once\nthe prisoner reaches the end of the second year of his\nterm, he will again be eligible to receive good time credits.\n   This process repeats itself for the third year of the term,\nand so on. In the final year of his term (in this example,\nthe tenth segment into which his term has been divided),\nthe prisoner will receive credit in a prorated amount, to be\nawarded \u201cwithin the last six weeks of the sentence.\u201d This\nensures that the prisoner does not reach the end of year\nten, only to find that he has just earned 54 days of credit\nhe no longer needs.\n   The controlling rule is that each year of the prisoner\u2019s\nterm\u2014each of the ten administrative segments\u2014\ncomprises 365 days that must be completed through a\n4                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncombination of service and credits. By combining actual\nprison time with the credits he has earned, a prisoner may\ncomplete a particular year of his term in less than 365\ncalendar days. As a result, credits may enable a well\nbehaved prisoner to complete his ten-year sentence before\nten calendar years have elapsed. For a ten-year (3,650\nday) sentence, a prisoner will serve 3,117 days behind bars\nif he earns a maximum of approximately 533 credits. This\nis 63 more days of credit than under the Court\u2019s reading\u2014\nmore than 6 additional credit days for every year of the\nsentence imposed.\n   Reading \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d this way is consistent\nwith all parts of the statute. The prisoner receives his\ncredit \u201cat the end of each year of [his] term of imprison\nment,\u201d a process that \u201cbegin[s] at the end of the first year\nof the term.\u201d Credit is only awarded if the prisoner has\nproven well behaved \u201cduring that year.\u201d This interpreta\ntion fulfills the \u201cobjective of \u00a73624\u201d\u2014rewarding a prisoner\nfor exemplary conduct during the preceding year. See\nante, at 8.\n   This approach also has a textual integrity that the\nCourt\u2019s reading does not: It gives \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d\nthe same meaning each time it is used by the statute.\nEvery time it appears in \u00a73624(b)(1), \u201cterm of imprison\nment\u201d refers to the administrative period that a prisoner\nmust complete in order to earn his freedom. The Court, by\ncontrast, would read this phrase to mean \u201ctime actually\nserved\u201d the third time it is used, but \u201cthe sentence im\nposed\u201d the first two times it is used (\u201c \u2018a prisoner who is\nserving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year[,]\nother than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the\nprisoner\u2019s life\u2019 \u201d). See ante, at 8\u20139. The Court\u2019s interpreta\ntion thus runs afoul of the \u201c \u2018presumption that a given\nterm is used to mean the same thing throughout a stat\nute.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9 (quoting Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S.\n115, 118 (1994)). The inconsistency here is particularly\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\negregious because all three uses appear in the same sen\ntence. See id., at 118 (\u201c[The] presumption [is] surely at its\nmost vigorous when a term is repeated within a given\nsentence\u201d).\n   The Court responds by noting another part of the stat\nute, a provision stating that prisoners shall receive cloth\ning, money, and transportation \u201c[u]pon the release of [the]\nprisoner on the expiration of the prisoner\u2019s term of impris\nonment.\u201d \u00a73624(d). A prisoner is released at the end of\nhis actual time behind bars, says the Court, and so \u201cterm\nof imprisonment\u201d must here refer to time actually served.\nYet release also comes at the end of a prisoner\u2019s \u201cterm\u201d in\nthe sense described above\u2014that is, when the balance of\nthe sentence has been reduced to zero through a combina\ntion of prison time and good time credits. Indeed, this\nadministrative use of the phrase fits well with the word\n\u201cexpiration,\u201d which in its most natural sense in this con\ntext refers to the close of a formal accounting period. See\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 619 (8th ed. 2004) (\u201cA coming to\nan end; esp., a formal termination on a closing date\u201d). By\ncontrast, it is awkward at best to say, as the Court would\nhave it, that a prisoner\u2019s actual time behind bars is some\nthing that \u201cexpires.\u201d\n   The Court\u2019s approach produces yet another oddity. The\nstatute requires that prorated credit be awarded for \u201cthe\nlast year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment.\u201d\nOne might naturally assume that the last year of a ten\nyear term would be year ten. That is how things work\nunder the approach described above, in which a ten-year\nsentence is subdivided into ten administrative segments.\n   But under the Court\u2019s reading, a prisoner serving a ten\nyear sentence will never reach year ten of his term; year\nten simply does not exist. According to the Court, year\nnine is the final year, and even year nine is not a full year:\nIt lasts \u201cno more than 298 days.\u201d Ante, at 3. If this\nsounds confusing, it will be all the more so to the prisoner\n6                   BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nwho has just received his sentence and turns to the statute\nbooks to figure out when to expect his freedom.\n   The Court does not even attempt to defend these flaws.\nInstead, it points to four supposed defects in the approach\ndescribed above. None withstands examination.\n   First, the Court notes that the statute requires the\nrelease of a prisoner \u201cupon \u2018the expiration of the prisoner\u2019s\nterm of imprisonment, less any time credited\u2019 for good\nbehavior.\u201d Ante, at 15 (quoting \u00a73624(a)). But if \u201cterm of\nimprisonment\u201d truly refers to the entire span that a pris\noner must complete to earn his freedom\u2014a period that\naccounts both for actual time and for good time credits\u2014\nthen why would the \u201cless any time credited\u201d language be\nappropriate? The answer is that this provision\u2014which\nappears at the very beginning of the section entitled \u201cRe\nlease of a prisoner\u201d\u2014announces to a prisoner when release\nmay be expected: when the prisoner\u2019s term expires, taking\ninto account credit days \u201cas provided in subsection (b).\u201d\n\u00a73624(a) (bold face deleted). This use of language is com\nmon. A debtor who says \u201cI will write a check for what I\nowe you, less what you owe me\u201d is simply saying \u201cI will\npay what I owe, taking into account your debts to me.\u201d\nPerhaps the same meaning could have been conveyed\nusing different words, but this is hardly probative.\n   Second, the Court alleges that the above approach con\nflicts with the statute\u2019s requirement that credit be\nawarded \u201cat the end of each year\u201d based upon behavior\n\u201cduring that year.\u201d After all, if a year of the term can be\nsatisfied in part through credit, then it may last less than\na full calendar year. Yet the statute does not require that\ncredit be awarded at the end of a calendar year for good\nbehavior during a calendar year. What it requires is that\ncredit be awarded \u201cat the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s\nterm of imprisonment\u201d for good behavior \u201cduring that\nyear.\u201d And this is precisely what the above approach does.\n   Third, the Court frets that, under the approach above,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nprisoners will earn credit at different rates during a single\nsentence. It admonishes that \u201c[t]he use of different rates\nfinds no support in the statute.\u201d Ante, at 16. This re\nsponse is telling. The statute, in fact, prescribes no par\nticular rate\u2014and certainly no formula based on a rate\u2014\nexcept as embodied in one clear directive: Prisoners are\neligible to earn \u201cup to 54 days at the end of each year of\nthe prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment.\u201d As to that com\nmand, the above approach is perfectly faithful.\n   Fourth, the Court suggests that the above approach\ncauses credit to vest immediately, contrary to the statute.\nAgain, this is not true. As per the statute, credit only\nvests \u201con the date the prisoner is released from custody,\u201d\n\u00a73624(b)(2), meaning that it can be revoked at any time\nbefore that date. This gives prisoners approaching their\nrelease date an extra incentive to behave.\n   As a fallback, the Court wonders what would happen if\na prisoner misbehaved on the final day of his ten-year\nsentence. Would the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) be forced to\n\u201cretroactively adjust the duration of all of his [term years]\nto 365 days\u201d? Ante, at 17. The answer is what one might\nsuppose: A prisoner whose credits are revoked will find\nhimself precisely where he would have been if those cred\nits had never been earned. All years of the term remain\n365 days, as they always have. But a misbehaving pris\noner who had formerly earned, say, 500 credits will find\nhimself without the benefit of those 500 days. That will\nleave him with more of his term to complete\u2014500 days\nmore, to be precise. If he behaves well again, he can re\nsume earning credit for the remainder of his term, but he\nhas lost the opportunity to earn credits for any prior years.\nSee \u00a73624(b)(1). This is not at all confusing for a prisoner;\nand certainly it is as straightforward, if not more so, than\nthe Court\u2019s approach. The Court\u2019s view causes a prisoner\u2019s\n\u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d to shrink over time according to\nan algebraic formula, only to expand again if he misbe\n8                    BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nhaves.\n   Finally, the Court speculates that BOP might find the\nabove approach difficult to administer. The Court identi\nfies no basis for this claim, nor does one exist. The infor\nmation used to calculate a prisoner\u2019s term under the above\napproach is the same as it is under the Court\u2019s approach.\nTrue, a prisoner may become eligible to be awarded credit\non different calendar days during the course of his term.\nBut under the Court\u2019s approach, this also happens when\nawarding credit in the final year. And, it goes without\nsaying, federal prisoners begin their incarceration on\ndifferent calendar days anyway, so that under any ap\nproach, BOP will be forced to evaluate prisoners through\nout the calendar year.\n                               II\n   The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a73624(b)(1), therefore, is less\nconsistent with the text than the reading explained above.\nBut even if these interpretations were in equipoise, under\nany fair application the rule of lenity should tip the bal\nance in petitioners\u2019 favor. When a penal statute is suscep\ntible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to the\ndefendant must be chosen unless \u201ctext, structure, and\nhistory . . . establish that the [harsher] position is unam\nbiguously correct.\u201d United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S.\n39, 54 (1994).

In Weaver, the Court considered whether an\namendment to Florida\u2019s statutory formula for calculating\ngood time credits implicated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nThe Court concluded that it did, as the new statute \u201csub\nstantially alter[ed] the consequences attached to a crime\nalready completed, and therefore change[d] \u2018the quantum\nof punishment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 33 (quoting Dobbert v. Florida,\n432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977)). For the same reason, the penal\neffect of \u00a73624(b)(1) is substantial enough to implicate the\nrule of lenity. We should not disadvantage almost 200,000\nfederal prisoners unless Congress clearly warned them\nthey would face that harsh result.\n                              III\n   The Government\u2014although not the Court\u2014argues that\nwe should embrace its interpretation out of deference to\nBOP. BOP has been charged by the Attorney General\nwith responsibility for \u201c[a]pproving inmate disciplinary\nand good time regulations.\u201d 28 CFR \u00a70.96(s) (2009). BOP\nhas long followed the same credit-calculation method now\nadvocated by the Court. The Government argues that we\nshould defer to BOP\u2019s choice as a permissible exercise of\nits delegated responsibility.\n   This argument fails on multiple levels. There is no\nindication that BOP has exercised the sort of interpretive\nauthority that would merit deference under Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\n467 U. S. 837 (1984). The statute does not create a legis\nlative gap for BOP to fill. To the contrary, the procedures\nthat govern the timing of credit awards are spelled out in\ngreat detail. Cf. Lopez v. Davis, 531 U. S. 230, 241\u2013242\n(2001) (where statute says that BOP \u201cmay\u201d grant early\n10                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nrelease to certain prisoners, without specifying further\ncriteria, Congress deliberately created a \u201cstatutory gap\u201d).\nThe statute even goes so far as to explain what to do \u201c[i]f\nthe date for a prisoner\u2019s release falls on a Saturday, a\nSunday, or a legal holiday.\u201d \u00a73624(a). This legislative\nspecificity as to timing contrasts with other provisions\nthat do delegate authority to BOP. E.g., \u00a73624(b)(1)\n(awarding of credit is \u201csubject to determination\u201d by BOP\nthat the prisoner \u201chas displayed exemplary compliance\nwith institutional disciplinary regulations\u201d).\n   BOP has not claimed that its view is the product of any\n\u201cformal administrative procedure tending to foster the\nfairness and deliberation that should underlie a pro\nnouncement\u201d with the force of law. United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U. S. 218, 230 (2001). In 2005, BOP made final\nan administrative rule adopting its preferred methodology.\n70 Fed. Reg. 66752 (adopting 28 CFR \u00a7523.20). But when\npressed during an earlier stage of this litigation, BOP\nconceded that it had \u201cfailed to articulate in the adminis\ntrative record the rationale upon which it relied when it\npromulgated\u201d the rule. Tablada v. Thomas, 533 F. 3d 800,\n805 (CA9 2008). The Court of Appeals accepted BOP\u2019s\nconcession, ibid., and that aspect of its ruling has not been\nappealed.\n   As a fallback position, the Government argues that\nBOP\u2019s interpretation should receive at least some defer\nence under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944).\nBut under Skidmore, an agency decision only merits \u201cre\nspect proportional to its \u2018power to persuade.\u2019 \u201d Mead,\nsupra, at 235 (quoting Skidmore, supra, at 140). BOP\u2019s\nposition is of long standing, but the administrative record\nis noteworthy for what it does not contain\u2014namely, any\nreasoned justification for preferring BOP\u2019s methodology\nover statutorily permissible alternatives. BOP has consis\ntently adhered to its mistaken belief that its approach is\nthe only one that can be squared with the text. See 62\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nFed. Reg. 50786 (1997) (explanation to interim rule assert\ning that the correct methodology \u201chad been clearly stated\nby statute since the implementation of the Sentencing\nReform Act of 1984\u201d). For example, at no point did BOP\nconsider, much less consciously reject, the interpretation\noutlined here. Cf. Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 60\u201361\n(1995) (deferring to BOP\u2019s reasoned decision to reject one\ninterpretation in favor of another). An agency need not\nconsider all possible alternatives. But deference is not\nowed to an agency view, however consistently held, that\nfrom the start has been premised on legal error. See\nMead, supra, at 228; Skidmore, supra, at 140.\n                        *     *     *\n  The straightforward interpretation urged here accords\nwith the purpose of the statute, which is to give prisoners\nincentive for good behavior and dignity from its promised\nreward. Prisoners can add 54 days to each year. And\nwhen they do so, they have something tangible. In place\nof that simple calculation, of clear meaning, of a calendar\nthat can be marked, the Court insists on something differ\nent. It advocates an interpretation that uses different\ndefinitions for the same phrase in the same sentence;\ndenies prisoners the benefit of the rule of lenity; and caps\noff its decision with an appendix that contains an alge\nbraic formula to hang on a cell wall.\n  To a prisoner, time behind bars is not some theoreti\ncal or mathematical concept. It is something real, even\nterrifying. Survival itself may be at stake. See Dept.\nof Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, C. Mumola,\nSuicide and Homicide in State Prisons and Local\nJails (NCJ 210036, Aug. 2005), online at http://\nbjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/shsplj.pdf (all Internet\nmaterials as visited June 2, 2010, and available in\nClerk of Court\u2019s case file) (prison homicide rates); Na\ntional Prison Rape Elimination Commission Re\n12                  BARBER v. THOMAS\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nport, p. 4 (June 2009) (citing a national survey estimating\nthat 60,500 state and federal prisoners had been sexually\nabused during the preceding year). To this time, the\nCourt adds days\u2014compounded to years. We should not\nembrace this harsh result where Congress itself has not\ndone so in clear terms. I would reverse the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n</pre>",
