NEW YORK\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF \n\n                 APPEALS OF NEW YORK\n\n              No. 09–9634. Decided June 7, 2010 \n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR respecting the denial\nof the petition for writ of certiorari.\n   This case presents the question whether petitioner’s\nrights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\nAmendment, as applied to the States through the Four\nteenth Amendment, were violated when the State intro\nduced testimony at his trial via a two-way video that\nenabled the testifying witness to see and respond to those\nin the courtroom, and vice versa. The question is an im\nportant one, and it is not obviously answered by Maryland\nv. Craig, 497 U. S. 836 (1990). We recognized in that case\nthat “a defendant’s right to confront accusatory witnesses\nmay be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face confronta\ntion at trial,” but “only where denial of such confrontation\nis necessary to further an important public policy.” Id., at\n850. In so holding, we emphasized that “[t]he requisite\nfinding of necessity must of course be a case-specific one.”\nId., at 855. Because the use of video testimony in this case\narose in a strikingly different context than in Craig, it is\nnot clear that the latter is controlling.\n   The instant petition, however, reaches us in an inter\nlocutory posture. The New York Court of Appeals re\nmanded to the Appellate Division for further review,\nincluding of factual questions relevant to the issue of\nnecessity. 14 N. Y. 3d 33, 40, 923 N. E. 2d 1099, 1103\n(2009). Granting the petition for certiorari at this time\nwould require us to resolve the threshold question\nwhether the Court of Appeals’ decision constitutes a\n2                  WROTTEN v. NEW YORK\n\n                  Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\n“[f]inal judgmen[t]” under 28 U. S. C. §1257(a). Moreover,\neven if we found the judgment final, in reviewing the case\nat this stage we would not have the benefit of the state\ncourts’ full consideration.\n   In light of the procedural difficulties that arise from the\ninterlocutory posture, I agree with the Court’s decision to\ndeny the petition for certiorari. But following the example\nof some of my colleagues, “I think it appropriate to empha\nsize that the Court’s action does not constitute a ruling on\nthe merits and certainly does not represent an expression\nof any opinion concerning” the importance of the question\npresented.
