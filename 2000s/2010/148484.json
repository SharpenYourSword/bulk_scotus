Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n                     DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u2013367.      Argued April 20, 2010\u2014Decided June 14, 2010\nPetitioner Dolan pleaded guilty to assault resulting in serious bodily\n  injury and entered into a plea agreement, which stated that the Dis\n  trict Court could order restitution for his victim. Dolan\u2019s presentence\n  report also noted that restitution was required, but did not recom\n  mend an amount because of a lack of information on hospital costs\n  and lost wages. The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act provides\n  that \u201cif the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10\n  days prior to sentencing,\u201d the court \u201cshall set a date for the final de\n  termination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentenc\n  ing.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73664(d)(5). On July 30, the District Court held a\n  sentencing hearing and imposed a sentence of imprisonment and su\n  pervised release. On August 8, the court entered a judgment, stating\n  that restitution was \u201capplicable\u201d but leaving open the amount of res\n  titution given that no information had yet \u201cbeen received regarding\n  possible restitution payments.\u201d On October 5, 67 days later, an ad\n  dendum documenting the restitution amount was added to the pre\n  sentence report. The court did not set a hearing until February 4,\n  about three months after the 90-day deadline had expired. At the\n  hearing, Dolan argued that because that deadline had passed, the\n  law no longer authorized restitution. Disagreeing, the court ordered\n  restitution, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A sentencing court that misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless\n retains the power to order restitution\u2014at least where, as here, that\n court made clear prior to the deadline\u2019s expiration that it would order\n restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount.\n Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) To determine the consequences of a missed deadline where, as\n here, the statute does not specify them, this Court looks to the statu\n2                      DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tory language, to the relevant context, and to what they reveal about\n    the deadline\u2019s purposes. A \u201cjurisdictional\u201d deadline\u2019s expiration pre\n    vents a court from permitting or taking the action to which the stat\n    ute attached the deadline. The prohibition is absolute. It cannot be\n    waived or extended for equitable reasons. See John R. Sand &\n    Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133\u2013134. Other deadlines\n    are \u201cclaims-processing rules,\u201d which do not limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction,\n    but regulate the timing of motions or claims brought before the court.\n    Unless a party points out that another litigant has missed such a\n    deadline, the party forfeits the deadline\u2019s protection. See, e.g., Kon\n    trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454\u2013456. In other instances, a deadline\n    seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is legally en\n    forceable but does not deprive the judge or other public official of the\n    power to take the action even if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,\n    United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722. In light of its\n    language, context, and purposes, the statute at issue sets forth this\n    third kind of limitation. The fact that a sentencing court misses the\n    90-day deadline, even through its own or the Government\u2019s fault,\n    does not deprive the court of the power to order restitution. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, where, as\n    here, a statute \u201cdoes not specify a consequence for noncompliance\n    with\u201d its \u201ctiming provisions,\u201d \u201cfederal courts will not\u201d ordinarily \u201cim\n    pose their own coercive sanction.\u201d United States v. James Daniel\n    Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63. A statute\u2019s use of \u201cshall\u201d alone,\n    see \u00a73664(d)(5), does not necessarily bar judges from taking the ac\n    tion to which the missed deadline refers. Second, the statute places\n    primary weight on, and emphasizes the importance of, imposing res\n    titution upon those convicted of certain federal crimes. See \u00a73663A.\n    Third, the statute\u2019s procedural provisions reinforce this substantive\n    purpose. They reveal that the statute seeks speed primarily to help\n    crime victims secure prompt restitution, not to provide defendants\n    with certainty as to the amount of their liability. Fourth, to read the\n    statute as depriving the sentencing court of the power to order resti\n    tution would harm the victims, who likely bear no responsibility for\n    the deadline\u2019s being missed and whom the statute seeks to benefit.\n    That kind of harm to third parties provides a strong indication that\n    Congress did not intend a missed deadline to work a forfeiture. See\n    Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 262. Fifth, the Court has in\n    terpreted similar statutes, such as the Bail Reform Act of 1984, simi\n    larly. See Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 721. Sixth, the defendant nor\n    mally can mitigate potential harm by telling the court that he fears\n    the deadline will be, or just has been, missed, and the court will\n    likely set a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.\n    Pp. 5\u201310.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     (c) This Court has not understated the potential harm to a defen\n  dant of a missed deadline. Petitioner claims that because the sen\n  tence will not be a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for appeal purposes without a de\n  finitive determination of the restitution amount, to delay that\n  determination beyond the deadline is to delay his ability to appeal.\n  But a defendant who knows that restitution will be ordered and is\n  aware of the amount can usually avoid additional delay by asking for\n  a timely hearing; if the court refuses, he could seek mandamus. And\n  in the unlikely instance that delay causes the defendant prejudice, he\n  remains free to ask the appellate court to take that fact and any\n  other equitable considerations into account on review. This does not\n  mean that the Court accepts petitioner\u2019s premise that a sentencing\n  judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d until the restitution amount is determined.\n  Although that question need not be decided here, strong arguments\n  favor the appealability of the initial judgment irrespective of the de\n  lay in determining the restitution amount. A judgment imposing\n  \u201c \u2018discipline\u2019 \u201d may still be \u201cfreighted with sufficiently substantial in\n  dicia of finality to support an appeal.\u201d Corey v. United States, 375\n  U. S. 169, 174. And several statutes say that a \u201cjudgment of convic\n  tion\u201d that \u201cincludes\u201d \u201cimprisonment\u201d is a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d E.g., 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a73582(b). Moreover, \u00a73664(o) provides that a \u201csentence that\n  imposes an order of restitution,\u201d such as the later restitution order\n  here, \u201cis a final judgment.\u201d Even assuming that the rule of lenity\n  could be applied to a statutory time provision in the criminal context,\n  here there is no statutory ambiguity sufficiently grievous to warrant\n  its application in this case.

The statute in question focuses upon mandatory\nrestitution for victims of crimes. It provides that \u201cthe\ncourt shall set a date for the final determination of the\nvictim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73664(d)(5). We hold that a sentencing court that\nmisses the 90-day deadline nonetheless retains the power\nto order restitution\u2014at least where, as here, the sentenc\ning court made clear prior to the deadline\u2019s expiration that\nit would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90\ndays) only the amount.\n                             I\n    On February 8, 2007, petitioner Brian Dolan pleaded\nguilty to a federal charge of assault resulting in serious\nbodily injury. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7113(a)(6), 1153; App. 17. He\nentered into a plea agreement that stated that \u201crestitution\n. . . may be ordered by the Court.\u201d Id., at 18. The presen\ntence report, provided to the court by the end of May,\nnoted that restitution was required. But, lacking precise\ninformation about hospital costs and lost wages, it did not\n2                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecommend a restitution amount. Id., at 27.\n  On July 30, the District Court held Dolan\u2019s sentencing\nhearing. The judge sentenced Dolan to 21 months\u2019 impris\nonment along with 3 years of supervised release. Id., at\n38. The judge, aware that restitution was \u201cmandatory,\u201d\nsaid that there was \u201cinsufficient information on the record\nat this time regarding possible restitution payments that\nmay be owed,\u201d that he would \u201cleave that matter open,\npending the receipt of additional information,\u201d and that\nDolan could \u201canticipate that such an award will be made\nin the future.\u201d Id., at 39\u201340. A few days later (August 8)\nthe court entered a judgment, which, among other things,\nstated:\n    \u201cPursuant to the Mandatory Restitution Act, restitu\n    tion is applicable; however, no information has been\n    received regarding possible restitution payments that\n    may be owed. Therefore, the Court will not order res\n    titution at this time.\u201d Id., at 49 (boldface deleted).\nThe probation office later prepared an addendum to the\npresentence report, dated October 5, which reflected the\nviews of the parties, and which the judge later indicated\nhe had received. Id., at 54. The addendum documents the\n\u201ctotal amount of restitution\u201d due in the case (about\n$105,000). Id., at 52. Its date, October 5, is 67 days after\nDolan\u2019s July 30 sentencing and 23 days before the stat\nute\u2019s \u201c90 days after sentencing\u201d deadline would expire.\n\u00a73664(d)(5).\n  The sentencing court nonetheless set a restitution hear\ning for February 4, 2008\u2014about three months after the\n90-day deadline expired. As far as the record shows, no\none asked the court for an earlier hearing. At the hearing,\nDolan pointed out that the 90-day deadline had passed.\nId., at 54\u201355. And he argued that the law no longer au\nthorized the court to order restitution. Id., at 60\u201364.\n  The court disagreed and ordered restitution.          See\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMemorandum Opinion and Restitution Order in No. CR\n06\u201302173\u2013RB (D NM, Apr. 24, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n47a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 571 F. 3d 1022\n(CA10 2009). And, in light of differences among the\nCourts of Appeals, we granted Dolan\u2019s petition for certio\nrari on the question. Compare United States v. Cheal, 389\nF. 3d 35 (CA1 2004) (recognizing court\u2019s authority to enter\nrestitution order past 90 days) and United States v. Balen\ntine, 569 F. 3d 801 (CA8 2009) (same), with United States\nv. Maung, 267 F. 3d 1113 (CA11 2001) (finding no such\nauthority), and United States v. Farr, 419 F. 3d 621 (CA7\n2005) (same).\n                             II \n\n                              A\n\n   There is no doubt in this case that the court missed the\n90-day statutory deadline \u201cfor the final determination of\nthe victim\u2019s losses.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5). No one has offered any\nexcuse for the court\u2019s doing so. Nor did any party seek an\nextension or \u201ctolling\u201d of the 90 days for equitable or for\nother reasons. All the information needed to determine\nthe requisite restitution amount was available before the\n90-day period had ended. Thus, the question before us\nconcerns the consequences of the missed deadline where,\nas here, the statute does not specify them.\n   In answering this kind of question, this Court has\nlooked to statutory language, to the relevant context, and\nto what they reveal about the purposes that a time limit is\ndesigned to serve. The Court\u2019s answers have varied de\npending upon the particular statute and time limit at\nissue. Sometimes we have found that the statute in ques\ntion imposes a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d condition upon, for example,\na court\u2019s authority to hear a case, to consider pleadings, or\nto act upon motions that a party seeks to file. See, e.g.,\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). But cf. Kontrick v.\nRyan, 540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004) (finding bankruptcy rule\n4                 DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not show legislative intent to \u201cdelineat[e] the classes of\ncases\u201d and \u201cpersons\u201d properly \u201cwithin a court\u2019s adjudica\ntory authority\u201d); see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5\u20136) (discussing use\nof term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d). The expiration of a \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d deadline prevents the court from permitting or\ntaking the action to which the statute attached the dead\nline. The prohibition is absolute. The parties cannot\nwaive it, nor can a court extend that deadline for equitable\nreasons. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,\n552 U. S. 130, 133\u2013134 (2008).\n   In other instances, we have found that certain deadlines\nare more ordinary \u201cclaims-processing rules,\u201d rules that do\nnot limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction, but rather regulate the\ntiming of motions or claims brought before the court.\nUnless a party points out to the court that another litigant\nhas missed such a deadline, the party forfeits the dead\nline\u2019s protection. See, e.g., Kontrick v. Ryan, supra, at\n454\u2013456 (60-day bankruptcy rule deadline for creditor\u2019s\nobjection to debtor discharge); Eberhart v. United States,\n546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam) (7-day criminal rule\ndeadline for filing motion for a new trial).\n   In still other instances, we have found that a deadline\nseeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is\nlegally enforceable but does not deprive a judge or other\npublic official of the power to take the action to which the\ndeadline applies if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722\n(1990) (missed deadline for holding bail detention hearing\ndoes not require judge to release defendant); Brock v.\nPierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 266 (1986) (missed deadline\nfor making final determination as to misuse of federal\ngrant funds does not prevent later recovery of funds);\nBarnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 171\u2013172\n(2003) (missed deadline for assigning industry retiree\nbenefits does not prevent later award of benefits).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  After examining the language, the context, and the\npurposes of the statute, we conclude that the provision\nbefore us sets forth this third kind of limitation. The\nfact that a sentencing court misses the statute\u2019s 90-day\ndeadline, even through its own fault or that of the Gov\nernment, does not deprive the court of the power to order\nrestitution.\n                              B\n  Several considerations lead us to this conclusion. First,\nwhere, as here, a statute \u201cdoes not specify a consequence\nfor noncompliance with\u201d its \u201ctiming provisions,\u201d \u201cfederal\ncourts will not in the ordinary course impose their own\ncoercive sanction.\u201d United States v. James Daniel Good\nReal Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63 (1993); see also Montalvo-\nMurillo, supra, at 717\u2013721. Cf., e.g., Speedy Trial Act, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1); \u00a73162(a)(2) (statute specifying that\nmissed 70-day deadline requires dismissal of indictment);\nZedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 507\u2013509 (2006)\n(\u201cThe sanction for a violation of the Act is dismissal\u201d).\n  We concede that the statute here uses the word \u201cshall,\u201d\n\u00a73664(d)(5), but a statute\u2019s use of that word alone has not\nalways led this Court to interpret statutes to bar judges\n(or other officials) from taking the action to which a\nmissed statutory deadline refers. See, e.g., Montalvo-\nMurillo, supra, at 718\u2013719 (use of word \u201cshall\u201d in context\nof bail hearing makes duty \u201cmandatory\u201d but does not\nmean that the \u201csanction for breach\u201d is \u201closs of all later\npowers to act\u201d); Brock, supra, at 262 (same in context of\nmisuse of federal funds); Barnhart, supra, at 158\u2013163\n(same in context of benefits assignments). See also Re\ngions Hospital v. Shalala, 522 U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998)\n(same in respect to federal official\u2019s reporting date).\n  Second, the statute\u2019s text places primary weight upon,\nand emphasizes the importance of, imposing restitution\nupon those convicted of certain federal crimes. Amending\n6                 DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan older provision that left restitution to the sentencing\njudge\u2019s discretion, the statute before us (entitled \u201cThe\nMandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996\u201d) says\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when sen\ntencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense . . . ,\nthe court shall order . . . that the defendant make restitu\ntion to the victim of the offense.\u201d \u00a73663A(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded); cf. \u00a73663(a)(1) (stating that a court \u201cmay\u201d order\nrestitution when sentencing defendants convicted of other\nspecified crimes). The Act goes on to provide that restitu\ntion shall be ordered in the \u201cfull amount of each victim\u2019s\nlosses\u201d and \u201cwithout consideration of the economic circum\nstances of the defendant.\u201d \u00a73664(f)(1)(A).\n   Third, the Act\u2019s procedural provisions reinforce this\nsubstantive purpose, namely, that the statute seeks pri\nmarily to assure that victims of a crime receive full resti\ntution. To be sure speed is important. The statute re\nquires a sentencing judge to order the probation office to\nprepare a report providing \u201ca complete accounting of the\nlosses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a\nplea agreement, and information relating to the economic\ncircumstances of each defendant.\u201d \u00a73664(a). The prosecu\ntor, after consulting with all identified victims, must\n\u201cpromptly provide\u201d a listing of the amount subject to resti\ntution \u201cnot later than 60 days prior to the date initially set\nfor sentencing.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(1) (emphasis added). And the\nprovision before us says:\n    \u201cIf the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable by the date\n    that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for\n    the Government or the probation officer shall so in\n    form the court, and the court shall set a date for the\n    final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to ex\n    ceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5).\nBut the statute seeks speed primarily to help the victims\nof crime and only secondarily to help the defendant. Thus,\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin the sentence following the language we have just\nquoted, the statute continues:\n    \u201cIf the victim subsequently discovers further losses,\n    the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those\n    losses in which to petition the court for an amended\n    restitution order.\u201d Ibid.\nThe sentence imposes no time limit on the victim\u2019s subse\nquent discovery of losses. Consequently, a court might\naward restitution for those losses long after the original\nsentence was imposed and the 90-day time limit has ex\npired. That fact, along with the Act\u2019s main substantive\nobjectives, is why we say that the Act\u2019s efforts to secure\nspeedy determination of restitution is primarily designed\nto help victims of crime secure prompt restitution rather\nthan to provide defendants with certainty as to the\namount of their liability. Cf. S. Rep. No. 104\u2013179, p. 20\n(1995) (recognizing \u201cthe need for finality and certainty in\nthe sentencing process,\u201d but also stating that the \u201csole due\nprocess interest of the defendant being protected . . . is the\nright not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid premises\nor inaccurate information\u201d); see also ibid. (\u201c[J]ustice can\nnot be considered served until full restitution is made\u201d).\n  Fourth, to read the statute as depriving the sentencing\ncourt of the power to order restitution would harm those\u2014\nthe victims of crime\u2014who likely bear no responsibility for\nthe deadline\u2019s being missed and whom the statute also\nseeks to benefit. Cf. \u00a73664(g)(1) (\u201cNo victim shall be re\nquired to participate in any phase of a restitution order\u201d).\nThe potential for such harm\u2014to third parties\u2014normally\nprovides a strong indication that Congress did not intend\na missed deadline to work a forfeiture, here depriving a\ncourt of the power to award restitution to victims. See\nBrock, 476 U. S., at 262 (parties concede and court as\nsumes that official can \u201cproceed after the deadline\u201d where\n\u201cinaction\u201d would hurt third party); see also 3 N. Singer &\n8                 DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJ. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a757:19,\npp. 73\u201374 (7th ed. 2008) (hereinafter Singer, Statutory\nConstruction) (missing a deadline does not remove power\nto exercise a duty where there is no \u201clanguage denying\nperformance after a specified time,\u201d and especially \u201cwhere\na mandatory construction might do great injury to persons\nnot at fault, as in a case where slight delay on the part of a\npublic officer might prejudice private rights or the public\ninterest\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n   Fifth, we have previously interpreted similar statutes\nsimilarly. In Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, for exam\nple, we considered the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which\nstates that a \u201cjudicial officer shall hold a hearing\u201d to de\ntermine whether to grant bail to an arrested person and\nthat \u201chearing shall be held immediately upon the person\u2019s\nfirst appearance before the judicial officer.\u201d (A continuance\nof up to five days may also be granted.) 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73142(f) (emphasis added). The judicial officer missed this\ndeadline, but the Court held that the judicial officer need\nnot release the detained person. Rather, \u201conce the Gov\nernment discovers that the time limits have expired, it\nmay [still] ask for a prompt detention hearing and make\nits case to detain based upon the requirements set forth in\nthe statute.\u201d 495 U. S., at 721.\n   The Court reasoned that \u201ca failure to comply\u201d with the\nhearing deadline \u201cdoes not so subvert the procedural\nscheme . . . as to invalidate the hearing.\u201d Id., at 717.\nMissing the deadline did not diminish the strength of the\nGovernment\u2019s interest in preventing release to avert the\nlikely commission of crimes\u2014the very objective of the Act.\nId., at 720. Nor would mandatory release of the detained\nperson \u201cproportion[ately]\u201d repair the \u201cinconvenience and\nuncertainty a timely hearing would have spared him.\u201d Id.,\nat 721.\n   Here, as in Montalvo-Murillo, neither the language nor\nthe structure of the statute requires denying the victim\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrestitution in order to remedy a missed hearing deadline.\nAs in Montalvo-Murillo, doing so would defeat the basic\npurpose of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. And,\nhere, as in Montalvo-Murillo, that remedy does not \u201cpro\nportion[ately]\u201d repair the harm caused the defendant\nthrough delay, particularly where, as here, the defendant\n\u201cknew about restitution,\u201d including the likely amount, well\nbefore expiration of the 90-day time limit. App. 62. In\ndeed, our result here follows from Montalvo-Murillo a\nfortiori, for here delay at worst postpones the day of finan\ncial reckoning. In Montalvo-Murillo, delay postponed a\nconstitutionally guaranteed bail hearing with the attached\nrisk that the defendant would remain improperly confined\nin jail. See 495 U. S., at 728 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)\n(noting the seriousness \u201cof the deprivation of liberty that\nphysical detention imposes\u201d).\n   Nor does Montalvo-Murillo stand alone. The Court\nthere found support in similar cases involving executive\nofficials charged with carrying out mandatory public\nduties in a timely manner. See id., at 718 (citing French v.\nEdwards, 13 Wall. 506, 511 (1872); Brock, supra, at 260).\nThose cases, in turn, are consistent with numerous similar\ndecisions made by courts throughout the Nation. See, e.g.,\nTaylor v. Department of Transp., 260 N. W. 2d 521, 522\u2013\n523 (Iowa 1977); Hutchinson v. Ryan, 154 Kan. 751, 756\u2013\n757, 121 P. 2d 179, 182 (1942); State v. Industrial\nComm\u2019n, 233 Wis. 461, 466, 289 N. W. 769, 771 (1940); see\nalso 3 Singer, Statutory Construction \u00a757:19, at 74 (citing\ncases).\n   Sixth, the defendant normally can mitigate any harm\nthat a missed deadline might cause\u2014at least if, as here,\nhe obtains the relevant information regarding the restitu\ntion amount before the 90-day deadline expires. A defen\ndant who fears the deadline will be (or just has been)\nmissed can simply tell the court, which will then likely set\na timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.\n10                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee \u00a73664(d)(4) (providing that \u201ccourt may require addi\ntional documentation or hear testimony\u201d); \u00a73664(d)(5).\nThough a deliberate failure of the sentencing court to\ncomply with the statute seems improbable, should that\noccur, the defendant can also seek mandamus. See All\nWrits Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a); La Buy v. Howes Leather\nCo., 352 U. S. 249 (1957). Cf. Brock, 476 U. S., at 260, n. 7\n(noting availability of district court action to compel\nagency compliance with time-related directive).\n                              C\n   Petitioner Dolan, however, believes we have under\nstated the harm to a defendant that a missed deadline can\ncause. To show this he makes a three-part argument: (1)\nA defendant cannot appeal a sentence unless it is part of a\n\u201cfinal judgment\u201d; (2) a judgment setting forth a sentence is\nnot \u201cfinal\u201d until it contains a definitive determination of\nthe amount of restitution; and (3) to delay the determina\ntion of the amount of restitution beyond the 90-day dead\nline is to delay the defendant\u2019s ability to appeal for more\nthan 90 days\u2014perhaps to the point where his due process\nrights are threatened. Brief for Petitioner 28\u201333.\n   The critical problem with this argument lies in its third\nstep. As we have said, a defendant who, like petitioner\nhere, knows that restitution will be ordered and is aware\nof the restitution amount prior to the expiration of the 90\nday deadline can usually avoid additional delay simply by\npointing to the statute and asking the court to grant a\ntimely hearing. That did not happen here. And that\nminimal burden on the defendant is a small cost relative\nto the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims of their\ndue restitution. (Should the court still refuse, the defen\ndant could seek mandamus\u2014which we believe will rarely\nbe necessary.)\n   Even in the unlikely instances where that delay does\ncause the defendant prejudice\u2014perhaps by depriving him\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof evidence to rebut the claimed restitution amount\u2014the\ndefendant remains free to ask the court to take that fact\ninto account upon review. That inquiry might also con\nsider the reason for the delay and the party responsible for\nits cause, i.e., whether the Government or the victim. Cf.,\ne.g., United States v. Stevens, 211 F. 3d 1, 4\u20136 (CA2 2000)\n(tolling 90-day deadline for defendant\u2019s bad-faith delay);\nUnited States v. Terlingo, 327 F. 3d 216, 218\u2013223 (CA3\n2003) (same). Adopting the dissent\u2019s approach, by con\ntrast, would permit a defendant\u2019s bad-faith delay to pre\nvent a timely order of restitution, potentially allowing the\ndefendant to manipulate whether restitution could be\nawarded at all. But since we are not presented with such\na case here, we need not decide whether, or how, such\npotential harm or equitable considerations should be\ntaken into consideration.\n   In focusing upon the argument\u2019s third step, we do not\nmean to imply that we accept the second premise, i.e., that\na sentencing judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d until it contains a\ndefinitive determination of the amount of restitution. To\nthe contrary, strong arguments favor the appealability of\nthe initial judgment irrespective of the delay in determin\ning the restitution amount. The initial judgment here\nimposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised re\nlease, and stated that restitution would be awarded. This\nCourt has previously said that a judgment that imposes\n\u201cdiscipline\u201d may still be \u201cfreighted with sufficiently sub\nstantial indicia of finality to support an appeal.\u201d Corey v.\nUnited States, 375 U. S. 169, 174, 175 (1963) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And the Solicitor General\npoints to statutes that say that a \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d\nthat \u201cincludes\u201d a \u201csentence to imprisonment\u201d is a \u201cfinal\njudgment.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(b). So is a judgment that\nimposes supervised release (which can be imposed only in\nconjunction with a sentence of imprisonment). Ibid.;\n\u00a73583(a). So is a judgment that imposes a fine. \u00a73572(c).\n12                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\u201334.\n   Moreover, \u00a73664(o) provides that a \u201csentence that im\nposes an order of restitution,\u201d such as the later restitution\norder here, \u201cis a final judgment.\u201d Thus, it is not surprising\nto find instances where a defendant has appealed from the\nentry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that\nincludes a term of imprisonment; that same defendant has\nsubsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the\nfinal amount of restitution; and the Court of Appeals has\nconsolidated the two appeals and decided them together.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Stevens, supra; United States v.\nMaung, 267 F. 3d 1113, 1117 (CA11 2001); cf. United\nStates v. Cheal, 389 F. 3d 35, 51\u201353 (CA1 2004).\n   That the defendant can appeal from the earlier sentenc\ning judgment makes sense, for otherwise the statutory 90\nday restitution deadline, even when complied with, could\ndelay appeals for up to 90 days. Defendants, that is,\nwould be forced to wait three months before seeking re\nview of their conviction when they could ordinarily do so\nwithin 14 days. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b). Nonethe\nless, in light of the fact that the interaction of restitution\norders with appellate time limits could have consequences\nextending well beyond cases like the present case (where\nthere was no appeal from the initial conviction and sen\ntence), we simply note the strength of the arguments\nmilitating against the second step of petitioner\u2019s argument\nwithout deciding whether or when a party can, or must,\nappeal. We leave all such matters for another day.\n   The dissent, however, creates a rule that could ad\nversely affect not just restitution, but other sentencing\npractices beyond the narrow circumstances presented\nhere. Consider, for example, a judge who (currently lack\ning sufficient information) wishes to leave open, say, the\namount of a fine, or a special condition of supervised re\nlease. In the dissent\u2019s view, the entry of any such judg\nment would immediately deprive the judge of the author\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nity later to fill in that blank, in the absence of a statute\nspecifically providing otherwise. See post, at 1\u20134 (opinion\nof ROBERTS, C. J.). Thus, the sentencing judge would\neither have to (1) forgo the specific dollar amount or poten\ntial condition, or (2) wait to enter any judgment until all of\nthe relevant information is at hand. The former alterna\ntive would sometimes deprive judges of the power to enter\ncomponents of a sentence they may consider essential.\nThe latter alternative would require the defendant to\nwait\u2014perhaps months\u2014before taking an appeal.\n   As we have pointed out, our precedents do not currently\nplace the sentencing judge in any such dilemma. See\nsupra, at 5, 8\u20139. And we need not now depart from those\nprecedents when this case does not require us to do so;\nwhen the issue has not been adequately briefed; when the\nlower court had no opportunity to consider the argument\n(which the petitioner may well have forfeited); and when\nthe rule would foreclose the current practices of some\ndistrict courts and unnecessarily cabin the discretion they\nproperly exercise over scheduling and sentencing matters.\nCf., e.g., United States v. Stevens, supra, at 3; United\nStates v. Cheal, supra, at 47 (illustrating district court\npractices).\n   Certainly there is no need to create this rule in the\ncontext of restitution, for provisions to which the dissent\nrefers are silent about whether restitution can or cannot\nbe ordered after an initial sentencing. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a73551(b),\n(c) (\u201cA sanction authorized by [criminal forfeiture and\nrestitution statutes] may be imposed in addition to the\n[rest of the] sentence\u201d); \u00a73663A(c)(1) (mandatory orders of\nrestitution \u201cshall apply in all sentencing proceedings [for\nspecified offenses]\u201d). And even on the dissent\u2019s theory, the\nstatute elsewhere provides the necessary substantive\nauthorization: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw, when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified]\noffense . . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant\n14                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmake restitution to the victim of the offense.\u201d \u00a73663A(a)(1)\n(emphasis added). The dissent cannot explain why a\nseparate statutory provision regarding procedures as to\nwhen a \u201ccourt shall set a date for the final determination\nof the victim\u2019s losses,\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5), automatically divests a\ncourt of this distinct substantive authority. While of\ncourse that provision does not \u201cplainly\u201d confer \u201cpower to\nact after sentencing,\u201d post, at 5 (emphasis deleted), neither\ndoes it \u201cplainly\u201d remove it or require that all sentencing\nmatters be concluded at one point in time. (And the dis\nsent\u2019s assertion, see post, at 6\u2014that it uses the term \u201cau\nthority\u201d not in its \u201cjurisdictional\u201d sense, but rather in the\nsense that a court lacks \u201cauthority\u201d to \u201cimpose a sentence\nabove the maximum\u201d\u2014introduces a tenuous analogy that\nmay well confuse this Court\u2019s precedents regarding the\nterm \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d See supra, at 3\u20134.)\n   In any event, unless one reads the relevant statute\u2019s 90\nday deadline as an ironclad limit upon the judge\u2019s author\nity to make a final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, the\nstatute before us itself provides adequate authority to do\nwhat the sentencing judge did here\u2014essentially fill in an\namount-related blank in a judgment that made clear that\nrestitution was \u201capplicable.\u201d App. 49 (boldface deleted).\nSince the sentencing judge\u2019s later order did not \u201ccorrect\u201d\nan \u201cerror\u201d in the sentence, Rule 35 does not apply. Com\npare Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a) with post, at 2\u20133. Hence\nthe dissent\u2019s claim that there is no other statute that\ncreates authority (even were we to assume all else in its\nfavor, which we do not) is merely to restate the question\nposed in this case, not to answer it.\n   Moreover, the dissent\u2019s reading creates a serious statu\ntory anomaly. It reads the statute as permitting a sen\ntencing judge to order restitution for a \u201cvictim\u201d who \u201csub\nsequently discovers further losses\u201d a month, a year, or 10\nyears after entry of the original judgment, while at the\nsame time depriving that judge of the power to award\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Compare \u00a73664(d)(5) (first sentence) with\n\u00a73664(d)(5) (second sentence). How is that a sensible\nreading of a statute that makes restitution mandatory for\nvictims?\n   Finally, petitioner asks us to apply the \u201crule of lenity\u201d in\nfavor of his reading of the statute. Dolan has not provided\nus with an example of an instance in which the \u201crule of\nlenity\u201d has been applied to a statutory time provision in\nthe criminal context. See United States v. Wiltberger, 5\nWheat. 76 (1820) (applying rule in interpreting substan\ntive criminal statute); Bifulco v. United States, 447 U. S.\n381, 387, 400 (1980) (applying rule in interpreting \u201cpenal\nties\u201d). But, assuming for argument\u2019s sake that the rule\nmight be so applied, and after considering the statute\u2019s\ntext, structure, and purpose, we nonetheless cannot find a\nstatutory ambiguity sufficiently \u201cgrievous\u201d to warrant its\napplication in this case.

S. C. \u00a73664(d)(5). Under the\nCourt\u2019s view, failing to meet the 90-day deadline has no\nconsequence whatever. The Court reads the statute as if\nit said \u201cthe court shall set a date for the final determina\ntion of the victim\u2019s losses, at any time after sentencing.\u201d I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  In the absence of \u00a73664(d)(5), any order of restitution\nmust be imposed at sentencing, if it is to be imposed at all.\nRestitution \u201cmay be imposed in addition to [a] sentence\u201d of\nprobation, fine, or imprisonment only if it is authorized\nunder \u00a73556.

They confer no authority to order restitution after\nsentencing has concluded. When Congress permits courts\nto impose criminal penalties at some time other than\nsentencing, it does so explicitly. See, e.g., \u00a73552(b) (provi\nsional sentence during a study period); \u00a73582(d) (authoriz\ning certain penalties \u201cin imposing a sentence . . . or at any\ntime thereafter\u201d); \u00a73583(e) (permitting extension of super\nvised release); \u00a7\u00a74244(d)\u2013(e) (provisional sentencing for\nthe mentally ill); see also Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.\n32.2(b)(2)(B), (4)(A) (presentencing forfeiture orders); cf.\nCorey v. United States, 375 U. S. 169 (1963) (appeals from\nprovisional and final sentences authorized by law).\n   Once a sentence has been imposed, moreover, it is final,\nand the trial judge\u2019s authority to modify it is narrowly\ncircumscribed. We have stated that \u201cthe trial courts had\nno such authority\u201d prior to the adoption of Rule 35, United\nStates v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178, 189, and n. 16 (1979),\nand Congress has since revoked the broad authority to\ncorrect illegal sentences originally set forth in that Rule.\nSee Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98\u2013473,\n\u00a7215(b), 98 Stat. 2015\u20132016; see also Historical Notes on\n1984 Amendments to Rule 35, 18 U. S. C. A., p. 605 (2008).\nToday, an error may be corrected by the trial court only if\nit is \u201cclear,\u201d and only within 14 days after the sentence is\nannounced. Rules 35(a), (c). The Rule of Criminal Proce\ndure allowing extensions of time expressly provides that\n\u201c[t]he court may not extend the time to take any action\nunder Rule 35, except as stated in that rule.\u201d Rule\n45(b)(2). This Court has reiterated that time limits made\nbinding under Rule 35 \u201cmay not be extended,\u201d Addonizio,\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam).\n   Thus, if the trial court fails to impose a mandatory term\nof imprisonment, see, e.g., \u00a7924(c)(1)(A), or a mandatory\nfine, see, e.g., 21 U. S. C. \u00a7844(a), or a mandatory order of\nrestitution, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a73663A, the Government can\nnot simply ask it to impose the correct sentence later. If\nthe error is clear, and raised within 14 days, it might be\ncorrected under Rule 35. Otherwise, the Government\nmust appeal, and seek resentencing on remand.\n\u00a7\u00a73742(b)(1), (g).\n   Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to these bed\nrock rules. It permits a trial court to go forward with\nsentencing while delaying any restitution order for up to\n90 days. This provision is meaningful precisely because\nrestitution must otherwise be ordered at sentencing, and\nbecause sentences are otherwise final unless properly\ncorrected. If trial courts had power to amend their sen\ntences at any time, \u00a73664(d)(5) would be unnecessary.\n   Here, however, the District Court failed to make use of\nits limited authority under \u00a73664(d)(5). Dolan was sen\ntenced on July 30, 2007. The court declined to order resti\ntution at that time or to set a date for a future restitution\norder. App. 35, 39\u201340; see also id., at 49.1 The 90-day\nperiod elapsed on October 28. At no time did the Govern\nment seek timely relief, whether under Rule 35 or by\nappeal. Cf. Corey, supra, at 174; Berman v. United States,\n302 U. S. 211, 212 (1937). Nor did it assert any claim that\nthe deadline had been lawfully extended or equitably\ntolled, an issue that I agree is not before us, see ante, at 3,\n11. But on April 24, 2008\u2014269 days after sentencing, and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Whether that date must itself be set at sentencing is not before us.\n\nThe order setting the date plainly cannot be entered 182 days after\nsentencing, as happened here. See App. 3\u20134.\n4                 DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nafter Dolan had already been released from prison\u2014the\nDistrict Court nonetheless ordered $104,649.78 in restitu\ntion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, 47a.\n   I cannot see where that court obtained authority to add\nadditional terms to Dolan\u2019s sentence. That is the step the\nCourt misses when it searches for the \u201cremedy\u201d for a\nviolation of \u00a73664(d)(5). Ante, at 1. The rule is that a trial\ncourt cannot alter a sentence after the time of sentencing.\nSection 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to that rule. If\nthe limits are exceeded the exception does not apply, and\nthe general rule takes over\u2014the sentence cannot be\nchanged to add a restitution provision. Section 3664(d)(5)\nis self-executing: It grants authority subject to a deadline,\nand if the deadline is not met, the authority is no longer\navailable.\n   The Court appears to reason that \u00a73664(d)(5) confers the\nauthority to add a restitution provision for at least 90\ndays, and that once the camel\u2019s nose of some permitted\ndelay sneaks under the tent, any further delay is permis\nsible. Ante, at 3, 5. But that is not what \u00a73664(d)(5) says.\nIt provides 90 days for a final determination of the victims\u2019\nlosses, not a free pass to impose restitution whenever the\ntrial court gets around to it. The court had no more power\nto order restitution 269 days after sentencing than it did\nto order an additional term of imprisonment and send\nDolan back to prison.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n    To avoid this conclusion, the Court runs through a\nseries of irrelevancies that cannot trump the clear statu\ntory text. It notes, for example, that \u00a73663A provides that\n\u201c \u2018[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when\nsentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense\n. . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant make\nrestitution to the victim of the offense.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6 (quot\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ning \u00a73663A(a)(1); emphasis in Court\u2019s opinion). But the\nissue before us is when restitution should be ordered, so\nthe language the Court should underscore is \u201cwhen sen\ntencing.\u201d This provision plainly confers no power to act\nafter sentencing. Any such power attaches only by virtue\nof \u00a73663A(d), which incorporates the procedures of \u00a73664,\nincluding the limited 90-day exception. See also \u00a73556\n(\u201cThe procedures under section 3664 shall apply to all\norders of restitution under this section\u201d).\n   The Court puts greater emphasis on its reading of the\nstatute\u2019s purpose, namely to provide restitution to victims\nof crime. Certainly that was a purpose Congress sought to\npromote. But \u201cno legislation pursues its purposes at all\ncosts,\u201d and \u201cit frustrates rather than effectuates legislative\nintent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the\nstatute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u201d Rodriguez v.\nUnited States, 480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987) (per curiam).\n   Congress had to balance against the interest in restitu\ntion the contrary interest in promptly determining the\ndefendant\u2019s sentence. The balance struck was clearly set\nforth in the statute: determine the victim\u2019s losses by a date\n\u201cnot to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5).\nWhether or not that limit was \u201cprimarily designed to help\nvictims of crime,\u201d ante, at 7, it does not cease to be law\nwhen invoked by defendants.\n   Nor can the Court find any support in the second sen\ntence of \u00a73664(d)(5). See ante, at 14\u201315. That provision\naddresses a distinct issue\u2014what to do about newly discov\nered losses\u2014and sets a higher \u201cgood cause\u201d standard. The\nfact that Congress struck the balance between restitution\nand finality differently in that context does not justify\noverriding the balance it struck here.\n   The Court also analogizes the 90-day limit to other\nprovisions discussed in our precedents, most of which have\nnothing to do with the rights of criminal defendants (for\nwhom procedural protections are of heightened impor\n6                   DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntance), let alone the finality of criminal sentencing. The\ncited cases are said to establish that an official\u2019s \u201cfailure to\nmeet [a] deadline\u201d does not always deprive that official of\n\u201cpower to act beyond it.\u201d Regions Hospital v. Shalala, 522\nU. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998). But the failure to comply with\n\u00a73664(d)(5) does not deprive anyone of anything: The trial\ncourt never had the general authority to alter sentences\nonce imposed, in the way that the administrative agencies\nin the cited cases were said to have general regulatory\nauthority. The trial court\u2019s authority to add a restitution\nprovision to an otherwise final sentence was conferred by\nthe very provision that limited that authority. Section\n3664(d)(5) did not take away anything that might persist\nin the absence of \u00a73664(d)(5).2\n   Even more perplexing is the Court\u2019s suggestion that\nreferences to the authority of trial courts necessarily\nimplicate questions of jurisdiction. Ante, at 14. To say\nthat a court lacks authority to order belated restitution\ndoes not use \u201cauthority\u201d in a jurisdictional sense, see\nArbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 511 (2006), but\nonly in the same sense in which a court lacks \u201cauthority\u201d\nto impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. Such\naction is an error of law, reversible on appeal, but it is not\njurisdictional. As in United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.\nEspinosa, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9), compli\nance with \u00a73664(d)(5) is \u201cnot a limitation on the . . . court\u2019s\njurisdiction,\u201d but it is a statutory \u201cprecondition to obtain\ning a [particular] order.\u201d Here that condition was not\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711 (1990), is equally\n\ninapposite: The statute in that case rested the lower court\u2019s authority\non whether a bail hearing had been held at all (it had), whereas here\nthe only statutory condition is whether the losses were determined\nwithin 90 days of sentencing (they were not).\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

It instead suggests that we abandon\nthe bedrock rules that sentences once imposed are final,\nand that the only exceptions are ones Congress chooses to\nallow (and Congress has allowed various ones). The Court\ninstead proposes a judicial power to alter sentences, ap\nparently at any time. But if a trial court can \u201cleave open,\nsay, the amount of a fine,\u201d ante, at 12, why not, say, the\nnumber of years? Thus, after a defendant like Dolan has\nserved his entire sentence\u2014and who knows how long\nafter?\u2014a court might still order additional imprisonment,\nadditional restitution, an additional fine, or an additional\ncondition of supervised release. See ante, at 12\u201313.\n   The Court cites no authority in support of such \u201cfill in\nth[e] blank\u201d sentencing, other than two cases implicated in\nthe Circuit split below. Ante, at 13. Prior to the enact\nment of \u00a73664(d)(5), however, it was widely recognized\nthat the requirement to impose restitution \u201cwhen sentenc\ning\u201d meant that \u201c[r]estitution must be determined at the\ntime of sentencing,\u201d and could not be left open after sen\ntencing had concluded.

Ante, at 14. True enough; but that is why the\nGovernment should lose. The limitation of Rule 35(a) to\nclear errors, corrected within 14 days of sentencing, does\nnot leave trial courts free to make other changes to sen\ntences whenever they choose. Rule 35(a) only makes sense\n8                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nagainst a background rule that trial courts cannot change\nsentences at will.\n   The same is true of \u00a73552(b), which empowers a court\nthat does not wish to delay sentencing but \u201cdesires more\ninformation than is otherwise available to it\u201d to impose a\nprovisional sentence during a 120-day study period. That\nstatute would be largely unnecessary if a trial court could\ndo the same by order.\n   In Addonizio, 442 U. S., at 189, we thought it noncon\ntroversial that a sentence once imposed is final, subject to\nsuch exceptions as Congress has allowed. Contrary to the\nCourt\u2019s suggestion, ante, at 13, Dolan invoked that princi\nple both here and below. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 13,\n15\u201318, 20, 29, 33, and n. 14, 36, 48, and n. 19; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 1, 5\u20138; Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief in No. 08\u2013\n2104 (CA10), pp. 12\u201313 (citing United States v. Blackwell,\n81 F. 3d 945, 949 (CA10 1996), for the proposition that a\n\u201cdistrict court does not have inherent authority to modify\na sentence\u201d). That the Court finds it necessary to question\nthat principle\u2014indeed, to accuse this dissent of \u201ccreat[ing]\nth[e] rule,\u201d ante, at 13\u2014highlights how misguided its\ndecision is.\n   To counter the effects of its opinion and to restore some\nsemblance of finality to sentencing, the Court advises\ndefendants to seek mandamus\u2014a remedy we have de\nscribed as \u201cdrastic and extraordinary,\u201d \u201creserved for really\nextraordinary causes,\u201d and one of \u201cthe most potent weap\nons in the judicial arsenal.\u201d Cheney v. United States Dist.\nCourt for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). What an odd procedure the Court\ncontemplates! A defendant, who should have received a\nharsher sentence, is to invoke the drastic and extraordi\nnary remedy of mandamus, to make sure he gets it. That\nis not how sentencing errors are corrected: If the trial\ncourt fails to order the appropriate sentence, the Govern\nment must appeal to correct it. It did not do so here, and\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthat ends the case. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S.\n___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6).\n  Moreover, the Court\u2019s mandamus remedy only helps\ndefendants who know they are in danger of an increased\nsentence. So the Court imposes another rule, namely that\nthe trial court must explicitly \u201cleave open\u201d the precise\nsentence at the time of sentencing, ante, at 12, or must\nmake clear, \u201cprior to the deadline\u2019s expiration[,] that it\nwould order restitution\u201d at some indeterminate time, ante,\nat 1 (emphasis added). But what if the court does not\nmake the crucial announcement at sentencing, or \u201cprior to\nthe deadline\u2019s expiration\u201d? Are these judicially created\ndeadlines to be taken more seriously than those imposed\nby Congress? Or are we just back at the beginning, asking\nwhat the \u201cremedy\u201d should be for failing to meet the rele\nvant deadline?\n  The Court\u2019s suggestion to require notice of intent to\naugment the sentence at some future date may be a good\nidea. But an even better one might be to set a particular\ndate\u2014say, 90 days after sentencing\u2014on which the parties\ncould base their expectations. That was Congress\u2019s choice,\nand it should be good enough for us.\n                        *      *    *\n   The District Court in this case failed to order mandatory\nrestitution in sentencing Dolan. That was wrong. But two\nwrongs do not make a right, and that mistake gave the\ncourt no authority to amend Dolan\u2019s sentence later, be\nyond the 90 days allowed to add a sentencing term requir\ning restitution.\n   I am mindful of the fact that when a trial court blun\nders, the victims may suffer. Consequences like that are\nthe unavoidable result of having a system of rules. If no\none appeals a mistaken ruling on the amount of restitu\ntion (or whether restitution applies at all), finality will\nnecessarily obstruct the victims\u2019 full recovery.\n10              DOLAN v.

Argued April 20, 2010\u2014Decided June 14, 2010\nPetitioner Dolan pleaded guilty to assault resulting in serious bodily\n  injury and entered into a plea agreement, which stated that the Dis\n  trict Court could order restitution for his victim. Dolan\u2019s presentence\n  report also noted that restitution was required, but did not recom\n  mend an amount because of a lack of information on hospital costs\n  and lost wages. The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act provides\n  that \u201cif the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10\n  days prior to sentencing,\u201d the court \u201cshall set a date for the final de\n  termination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentenc\n  ing.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73664(d)(5). On July 30, the District Court held a\n  sentencing hearing and imposed a sentence of imprisonment and su\n  pervised release. On August 8, the court entered a judgment, stating\n  that restitution was \u201capplicable\u201d but leaving open the amount of res\n  titution given that no information had yet \u201cbeen received regarding\n  possible restitution payments.\u201d On October 5, 67 days later, an ad\n  dendum documenting the restitution amount was added to the pre\n  sentence report. The court did not set a hearing until February 4,\n  about three months after the 90-day deadline had expired. At the\n  hearing, Dolan argued that because that deadline had passed, the\n  law no longer authorized restitution. Disagreeing, the court ordered\n  restitution, and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A sentencing court that misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless\n retains the power to order restitution\u2014at least where, as here, that\n court made clear prior to the deadline\u2019s expiration that it would order\n restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount.\n Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) To determine the consequences of a missed deadline where, as\n here, the statute does not specify them, this Court looks to the statu\n2                      DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tory language, to the relevant context, and to what they reveal about\n    the deadline\u2019s purposes. A \u201cjurisdictional\u201d deadline\u2019s expiration pre\n    vents a court from permitting or taking the action to which the stat\n    ute attached the deadline. The prohibition is absolute. It cannot be\n    waived or extended for equitable reasons. See John R. Sand &\n    Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133\u2013134. Other deadlines\n    are \u201cclaims-processing rules,\u201d which do not limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction,\n    but regulate the timing of motions or claims brought before the court.\n    Unless a party points out that another litigant has missed such a\n    deadline, the party forfeits the deadline\u2019s protection. See, e.g., Kon\n    trick v. Ryan, 540 U. S. 443, 454\u2013456. In other instances, a deadline\n    seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is legally en\n    forceable but does not deprive the judge or other public official of the\n    power to take the action even if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,\n    United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722. In light of its\n    language, context, and purposes, the statute at issue sets forth this\n    third kind of limitation. The fact that a sentencing court misses the\n    90-day deadline, even through its own or the Government\u2019s fault,\n    does not deprive the court of the power to order restitution. Pp. 3\u20135.\n       (b) Several considerations lead to this conclusion. First, where, as\n    here, a statute \u201cdoes not specify a consequence for noncompliance\n    with\u201d its \u201ctiming provisions,\u201d \u201cfederal courts will not\u201d ordinarily \u201cim\n    pose their own coercive sanction.\u201d United States v.

A statute\u2019s use of \u201cshall\u201d alone,\n    see \u00a73664(d)(5), does not necessarily bar judges from taking the ac\n    tion to which the missed deadline refers. Second, the statute places\n    primary weight on, and emphasizes the importance of, imposing res\n    titution upon those convicted of certain federal crimes. See \u00a73663A.\n    Third, the statute\u2019s procedural provisions reinforce this substantive\n    purpose. They reveal that the statute seeks speed primarily to help\n    crime victims secure prompt restitution, not to provide defendants\n    with certainty as to the amount of their liability. Fourth, to read the\n    statute as depriving the sentencing court of the power to order resti\n    tution would harm the victims, who likely bear no responsibility for\n    the deadline\u2019s being missed and whom the statute seeks to benefit.\n    That kind of harm to third parties provides a strong indication that\n    Congress did not intend a missed deadline to work a forfeiture. See\n    Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 262. Fifth, the Court has in\n    terpreted similar statutes, such as the Bail Reform Act of 1984, simi\n    larly. See Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 721. Sixth, the defendant nor\n    mally can mitigate potential harm by telling the court that he fears\n    the deadline will be, or just has been, missed, and the court will\n    likely set a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.\n    Pp. 5\u201310.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     (c) This Court has not understated the potential harm to a defen\n  dant of a missed deadline. Petitioner claims that because the sen\n  tence will not be a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for appeal purposes without a de\n  finitive determination of the restitution amount, to delay that\n  determination beyond the deadline is to delay his ability to appeal.\n  But a defendant who knows that restitution will be ordered and is\n  aware of the amount can usually avoid additional delay by asking for\n  a timely hearing; if the court refuses, he could seek mandamus. And\n  in the unlikely instance that delay causes the defendant prejudice, he\n  remains free to ask the appellate court to take that fact and any\n  other equitable considerations into account on review. This does not\n  mean that the Court accepts petitioner\u2019s premise that a sentencing\n  judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d until the restitution amount is determined.\n  Although that question need not be decided here, strong arguments\n  favor the appealability of the initial judgment irrespective of the de\n  lay in determining the restitution amount. A judgment imposing\n  \u201c \u2018discipline\u2019 \u201d may still be \u201cfreighted with sufficiently substantial in\n  dicia of finality to support an appeal.\u201d Corey v. United States, 375\n  U. S. 169, 174. And several statutes say that a \u201cjudgment of convic\n  tion\u201d that \u201cincludes\u201d \u201cimprisonment\u201d is a \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d E.g., 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a73582(b). Moreover, \u00a73664(o) provides that a \u201csentence that\n  imposes an order of restitution,\u201d such as the later restitution order\n  here, \u201cis a final judgment.\u201d Even assuming that the rule of lenity\n  could be applied to a statutory time provision in the criminal context,\n  here there is no statutory ambiguity sufficiently grievous to warrant\n  its application in this case.

The statute in question focuses upon mandatory\nrestitution for victims of crimes. It provides that \u201cthe\ncourt shall set a date for the final determination of the\nvictim\u2019s losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73664(d)(5). We hold that a sentencing court that\nmisses the 90-day deadline nonetheless retains the power\nto order restitution\u2014at least where, as here, the sentenc\ning court made clear prior to the deadline\u2019s expiration that\nit would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90\ndays) only the amount.\n                             I\n    On February 8, 2007, petitioner Brian Dolan pleaded\nguilty to a federal charge of assault resulting in serious\nbodily injury. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7113(a)(6), 1153; App. 17. He\nentered into a plea agreement that stated that \u201crestitution\n. . . may be ordered by the Court.\u201d Id., at 18. The presen\ntence report, provided to the court by the end of May,\nnoted that restitution was required. But, lacking precise\ninformation about hospital costs and lost wages, it did not\n2                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecommend a restitution amount. Id., at 27.\n  On July 30, the District Court held Dolan\u2019s sentencing\nhearing. The judge sentenced Dolan to 21 months\u2019 impris\nonment along with 3 years of supervised release. Id., at\n38. The judge, aware that restitution was \u201cmandatory,\u201d\nsaid that there was \u201cinsufficient information on the record\nat this time regarding possible restitution payments that\nmay be owed,\u201d that he would \u201cleave that matter open,\npending the receipt of additional information,\u201d and that\nDolan could \u201canticipate that such an award will be made\nin the future.\u201d Id., at 39\u201340. A few days later (August 8)\nthe court entered a judgment, which, among other things,\nstated:\n    \u201cPursuant to the Mandatory Restitution Act, restitu\n    tion is applicable; however, no information has been\n    received regarding possible restitution payments that\n    may be owed. Therefore, the Court will not order res\n    titution at this time.\u201d Id., at 49 (boldface deleted).\nThe probation office later prepared an addendum to the\npresentence report, dated October 5, which reflected the\nviews of the parties, and which the judge later indicated\nhe had received. Id., at 54. The addendum documents the\n\u201ctotal amount of restitution\u201d due in the case (about\n$105,000). Id., at 52. Its date, October 5, is 67 days after\nDolan\u2019s July 30 sentencing and 23 days before the stat\nute\u2019s \u201c90 days after sentencing\u201d deadline would expire.\n\u00a73664(d)(5).\n  The sentencing court nonetheless set a restitution hear\ning for February 4, 2008\u2014about three months after the\n90-day deadline expired. As far as the record shows, no\none asked the court for an earlier hearing. At the hearing,\nDolan pointed out that the 90-day deadline had passed.\nId., at 54\u201355. And he argued that the law no longer au\nthorized the court to order restitution. Id., at 60\u201364.\n  The court disagreed and ordered restitution.          See\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMemorandum Opinion and Restitution Order in No. CR\n06\u201302173\u2013RB (D NM, Apr. 24, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n47a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 571 F. 3d 1022\n(CA10 2009). And, in light of differences among the\nCourts of Appeals, we granted Dolan\u2019s petition for certio\nrari on the question. Compare United States v. Cheal, 389\nF. 3d 35 (CA1 2004) (recognizing court\u2019s authority to enter\nrestitution order past 90 days) and United States v. Balen\ntine, 569 F. 3d 801 (CA8 2009) (same), with United States\nv. Maung, 267 F. 3d 1113 (CA11 2001) (finding no such\nauthority), and United States v. Farr, 419 F. 3d 621 (CA7\n2005) (same).\n                             II \n\n                              A\n\n   There is no doubt in this case that the court missed the\n90-day statutory deadline \u201cfor the final determination of\nthe victim\u2019s losses.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5). No one has offered any\nexcuse for the court\u2019s doing so. Nor did any party seek an\nextension or \u201ctolling\u201d of the 90 days for equitable or for\nother reasons. All the information needed to determine\nthe requisite restitution amount was available before the\n90-day period had ended. Thus, the question before us\nconcerns the consequences of the missed deadline where,\nas here, the statute does not specify them.\n   In answering this kind of question, this Court has\nlooked to statutory language, to the relevant context, and\nto what they reveal about the purposes that a time limit is\ndesigned to serve. The Court\u2019s answers have varied de\npending upon the particular statute and time limit at\nissue. Sometimes we have found that the statute in ques\ntion imposes a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d condition upon, for example,\na court\u2019s authority to hear a case, to consider pleadings, or\nto act upon motions that a party seeks to file. See, e.g.,\nBowles v. Russell, 551 U. S. 205 (2007). But cf. Kontrick v.\nRyan, 540 U. S. 443, 455 (2004) (finding bankruptcy rule\n4                 DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not show legislative intent to \u201cdelineat[e] the classes of\ncases\u201d and \u201cpersons\u201d properly \u201cwithin a court\u2019s adjudica\ntory authority\u201d); see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5\u20136) (discussing use\nof term \u201cjurisdictional\u201d). The expiration of a \u201cjurisdic\ntional\u201d deadline prevents the court from permitting or\ntaking the action to which the statute attached the dead\nline. The prohibition is absolute. The parties cannot\nwaive it, nor can a court extend that deadline for equitable\nreasons. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,\n552 U. S. 130, 133\u2013134 (2008).\n   In other instances, we have found that certain deadlines\nare more ordinary \u201cclaims-processing rules,\u201d rules that do\nnot limit a court\u2019s jurisdiction, but rather regulate the\ntiming of motions or claims brought before the court.\nUnless a party points out to the court that another litigant\nhas missed such a deadline, the party forfeits the dead\nline\u2019s protection. See, e.g., Kontrick v. Ryan, supra, at\n454\u2013456 (60-day bankruptcy rule deadline for creditor\u2019s\nobjection to debtor discharge); Eberhart v. United States,\n546 U. S. 12, 19 (2005) (per curiam) (7-day criminal rule\ndeadline for filing motion for a new trial).\n   In still other instances, we have found that a deadline\nseeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is\nlegally enforceable but does not deprive a judge or other\npublic official of the power to take the action to which the\ndeadline applies if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722\n(1990) (missed deadline for holding bail detention hearing\ndoes not require judge to release defendant); Brock v.\nPierce County, 476 U. S. 253, 266 (1986) (missed deadline\nfor making final determination as to misuse of federal\ngrant funds does not prevent later recovery of funds);\nBarnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 171\u2013172\n(2003) (missed deadline for assigning industry retiree\nbenefits does not prevent later award of benefits).\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  After examining the language, the context, and the\npurposes of the statute, we conclude that the provision\nbefore us sets forth this third kind of limitation. The\nfact that a sentencing court misses the statute\u2019s 90-day\ndeadline, even through its own fault or that of the Gov\nernment, does not deprive the court of the power to order\nrestitution.\n                              B\n  Several considerations lead us to this conclusion. First,\nwhere, as here, a statute \u201cdoes not specify a consequence\nfor noncompliance with\u201d its \u201ctiming provisions,\u201d \u201cfederal\ncourts will not in the ordinary course impose their own\ncoercive sanction.\u201d United States v. James Daniel Good\nReal Property, 510 U. S. 43, 63 (1993); see also Montalvo-\nMurillo, supra, at 717\u2013721. Cf., e.g., Speedy Trial Act, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73161(c)(1); \u00a73162(a)(2) (statute specifying that\nmissed 70-day deadline requires dismissal of indictment);\nZedner v. United States, 547 U. S. 489, 507\u2013509 (2006)\n(\u201cThe sanction for a violation of the Act is dismissal\u201d).\n  We concede that the statute here uses the word \u201cshall,\u201d\n\u00a73664(d)(5), but a statute\u2019s use of that word alone has not\nalways led this Court to interpret statutes to bar judges\n(or other officials) from taking the action to which a\nmissed statutory deadline refers. See, e.g., Montalvo-\nMurillo, supra, at 718\u2013719 (use of word \u201cshall\u201d in context\nof bail hearing makes duty \u201cmandatory\u201d but does not\nmean that the \u201csanction for breach\u201d is \u201closs of all later\npowers to act\u201d); Brock, supra, at 262 (same in context of\nmisuse of federal funds); Barnhart, supra, at 158\u2013163\n(same in context of benefits assignments). See also Re\ngions Hospital v. Shalala, 522 U. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998)\n(same in respect to federal official\u2019s reporting date).\n  Second, the statute\u2019s text places primary weight upon,\nand emphasizes the importance of, imposing restitution\nupon those convicted of certain federal crimes. Amending\n6                 DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nan older provision that left restitution to the sentencing\njudge\u2019s discretion, the statute before us (entitled \u201cThe\nMandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996\u201d) says\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when sen\ntencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense . . . ,\nthe court shall order . . . that the defendant make restitu\ntion to the victim of the offense.\u201d \u00a73663A(a)(1) (emphasis\nadded); cf. \u00a73663(a)(1) (stating that a court \u201cmay\u201d order\nrestitution when sentencing defendants convicted of other\nspecified crimes). The Act goes on to provide that restitu\ntion shall be ordered in the \u201cfull amount of each victim\u2019s\nlosses\u201d and \u201cwithout consideration of the economic circum\nstances of the defendant.\u201d \u00a73664(f)(1)(A).\n   Third, the Act\u2019s procedural provisions reinforce this\nsubstantive purpose, namely, that the statute seeks pri\nmarily to assure that victims of a crime receive full resti\ntution. To be sure speed is important. The statute re\nquires a sentencing judge to order the probation office to\nprepare a report providing \u201ca complete accounting of the\nlosses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a\nplea agreement, and information relating to the economic\ncircumstances of each defendant.\u201d \u00a73664(a). The prosecu\ntor, after consulting with all identified victims, must\n\u201cpromptly provide\u201d a listing of the amount subject to resti\ntution \u201cnot later than 60 days prior to the date initially set\nfor sentencing.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(1) (emphasis added). And the\nprovision before us says:\n    \u201cIf the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable by the date\n    that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for\n    the Government or the probation officer shall so in\n    form the court, and the court shall set a date for the\n    final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, not to ex\n    ceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5).\nBut the statute seeks speed primarily to help the victims\nof crime and only secondarily to help the defendant. Thus,\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin the sentence following the language we have just\nquoted, the statute continues:\n    \u201cIf the victim subsequently discovers further losses,\n    the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those\n    losses in which to petition the court for an amended\n    restitution order.\u201d Ibid.\nThe sentence imposes no time limit on the victim\u2019s subse\nquent discovery of losses. Consequently, a court might\naward restitution for those losses long after the original\nsentence was imposed and the 90-day time limit has ex\npired. That fact, along with the Act\u2019s main substantive\nobjectives, is why we say that the Act\u2019s efforts to secure\nspeedy determination of restitution is primarily designed\nto help victims of crime secure prompt restitution rather\nthan to provide defendants with certainty as to the\namount of their liability. Cf. S. Rep. No. 104\u2013179, p. 20\n(1995) (recognizing \u201cthe need for finality and certainty in\nthe sentencing process,\u201d but also stating that the \u201csole due\nprocess interest of the defendant being protected . . . is the\nright not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid premises\nor inaccurate information\u201d); see also ibid. (\u201c[J]ustice can\nnot be considered served until full restitution is made\u201d).\n  Fourth, to read the statute as depriving the sentencing\ncourt of the power to order restitution would harm those\u2014\nthe victims of crime\u2014who likely bear no responsibility for\nthe deadline\u2019s being missed and whom the statute also\nseeks to benefit. Cf. \u00a73664(g)(1) (\u201cNo victim shall be re\nquired to participate in any phase of a restitution order\u201d).\nThe potential for such harm\u2014to third parties\u2014normally\nprovides a strong indication that Congress did not intend\na missed deadline to work a forfeiture, here depriving a\ncourt of the power to award restitution to victims. See\nBrock, 476 U. S., at 262 (parties concede and court as\nsumes that official can \u201cproceed after the deadline\u201d where\n\u201cinaction\u201d would hurt third party); see also 3 N. Singer &\n8                 DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJ. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction \u00a757:19,\npp. 73\u201374 (7th ed. 2008) (hereinafter Singer, Statutory\nConstruction) (missing a deadline does not remove power\nto exercise a duty where there is no \u201clanguage denying\nperformance after a specified time,\u201d and especially \u201cwhere\na mandatory construction might do great injury to persons\nnot at fault, as in a case where slight delay on the part of a\npublic officer might prejudice private rights or the public\ninterest\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n   Fifth, we have previously interpreted similar statutes\nsimilarly. In Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, for exam\nple, we considered the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which\nstates that a \u201cjudicial officer shall hold a hearing\u201d to de\ntermine whether to grant bail to an arrested person and\nthat \u201chearing shall be held immediately upon the person\u2019s\nfirst appearance before the judicial officer.\u201d (A continuance\nof up to five days may also be granted.) 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73142(f) (emphasis added). The judicial officer missed this\ndeadline, but the Court held that the judicial officer need\nnot release the detained person. Rather, \u201conce the Gov\nernment discovers that the time limits have expired, it\nmay [still] ask for a prompt detention hearing and make\nits case to detain based upon the requirements set forth in\nthe statute.\u201d 495 U. S., at 721.\n   The Court reasoned that \u201ca failure to comply\u201d with the\nhearing deadline \u201cdoes not so subvert the procedural\nscheme . . . as to invalidate the hearing.\u201d Id., at 717.\nMissing the deadline did not diminish the strength of the\nGovernment\u2019s interest in preventing release to avert the\nlikely commission of crimes\u2014the very objective of the Act.\nId., at 720. Nor would mandatory release of the detained\nperson \u201cproportion[ately]\u201d repair the \u201cinconvenience and\nuncertainty a timely hearing would have spared him.\u201d Id.,\nat 721.\n   Here, as in Montalvo-Murillo, neither the language nor\nthe structure of the statute requires denying the victim\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrestitution in order to remedy a missed hearing deadline.\nAs in Montalvo-Murillo, doing so would defeat the basic\npurpose of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. And,\nhere, as in Montalvo-Murillo, that remedy does not \u201cpro\nportion[ately]\u201d repair the harm caused the defendant\nthrough delay, particularly where, as here, the defendant\n\u201cknew about restitution,\u201d including the likely amount, well\nbefore expiration of the 90-day time limit. App. 62. In\ndeed, our result here follows from Montalvo-Murillo a\nfortiori, for here delay at worst postpones the day of finan\ncial reckoning. In Montalvo-Murillo, delay postponed a\nconstitutionally guaranteed bail hearing with the attached\nrisk that the defendant would remain improperly confined\nin jail. See 495 U.

W. 769, 771 (1940); see\nalso 3 Singer, Statutory Construction \u00a757:19, at 74 (citing\ncases).\n   Sixth, the defendant normally can mitigate any harm\nthat a missed deadline might cause\u2014at least if, as here,\nhe obtains the relevant information regarding the restitu\ntion amount before the 90-day deadline expires. A defen\ndant who fears the deadline will be (or just has been)\nmissed can simply tell the court, which will then likely set\na timely hearing or take other statutorily required action.\n10                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSee \u00a73664(d)(4) (providing that \u201ccourt may require addi\ntional documentation or hear testimony\u201d); \u00a73664(d)(5).\nThough a deliberate failure of the sentencing court to\ncomply with the statute seems improbable, should that\noccur, the defendant can also seek mandamus. See All\nWrits Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a); La Buy v. Howes Leather\nCo., 352 U. S. 249 (1957). Cf. Brock, 476 U. S., at 260, n. 7\n(noting availability of district court action to compel\nagency compliance with time-related directive).\n                              C\n   Petitioner Dolan, however, believes we have under\nstated the harm to a defendant that a missed deadline can\ncause. To show this he makes a three-part argument: (1)\nA defendant cannot appeal a sentence unless it is part of a\n\u201cfinal judgment\u201d; (2) a judgment setting forth a sentence is\nnot \u201cfinal\u201d until it contains a definitive determination of\nthe amount of restitution; and (3) to delay the determina\ntion of the amount of restitution beyond the 90-day dead\nline is to delay the defendant\u2019s ability to appeal for more\nthan 90 days\u2014perhaps to the point where his due process\nrights are threatened. Brief for Petitioner 28\u201333.\n   The critical problem with this argument lies in its third\nstep. As we have said, a defendant who, like petitioner\nhere, knows that restitution will be ordered and is aware\nof the restitution amount prior to the expiration of the 90\nday deadline can usually avoid additional delay simply by\npointing to the statute and asking the court to grant a\ntimely hearing. That did not happen here. And that\nminimal burden on the defendant is a small cost relative\nto the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims of their\ndue restitution. (Should the court still refuse, the defen\ndant could seek mandamus\u2014which we believe will rarely\nbe necessary.)\n   Even in the unlikely instances where that delay does\ncause the defendant prejudice\u2014perhaps by depriving him\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof evidence to rebut the claimed restitution amount\u2014the\ndefendant remains free to ask the court to take that fact\ninto account upon review. That inquiry might also con\nsider the reason for the delay and the party responsible for\nits cause, i.e., whether the Government or the victim. Cf.,\ne.g., United States v. Stevens, 211 F. 3d 1, 4\u20136 (CA2 2000)\n(tolling 90-day deadline for defendant\u2019s bad-faith delay);\nUnited States v. Terlingo, 327 F. 3d 216, 218\u2013223 (CA3\n2003) (same). Adopting the dissent\u2019s approach, by con\ntrast, would permit a defendant\u2019s bad-faith delay to pre\nvent a timely order of restitution, potentially allowing the\ndefendant to manipulate whether restitution could be\nawarded at all. But since we are not presented with such\na case here, we need not decide whether, or how, such\npotential harm or equitable considerations should be\ntaken into consideration.\n   In focusing upon the argument\u2019s third step, we do not\nmean to imply that we accept the second premise, i.e., that\na sentencing judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d until it contains a\ndefinitive determination of the amount of restitution. To\nthe contrary, strong arguments favor the appealability of\nthe initial judgment irrespective of the delay in determin\ning the restitution amount. The initial judgment here\nimposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised re\nlease, and stated that restitution would be awarded. This\nCourt has previously said that a judgment that imposes\n\u201cdiscipline\u201d may still be \u201cfreighted with sufficiently sub\nstantial indicia of finality to support an appeal.\u201d Corey v.\nUnited States, 375 U. S. 169, 174, 175 (1963) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And the Solicitor General\npoints to statutes that say that a \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d\nthat \u201cincludes\u201d a \u201csentence to imprisonment\u201d is a \u201cfinal\njudgment.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(b). So is a judgment that\nimposes supervised release (which can be imposed only in\nconjunction with a sentence of imprisonment). Ibid.;\n\u00a73583(a). So is a judgment that imposes a fine. \u00a73572(c).\n12                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\u201334.\n   Moreover, \u00a73664(o) provides that a \u201csentence that im\nposes an order of restitution,\u201d such as the later restitution\norder here, \u201cis a final judgment.\u201d Thus, it is not surprising\nto find instances where a defendant has appealed from the\nentry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that\nincludes a term of imprisonment; that same defendant has\nsubsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the\nfinal amount of restitution; and the Court of Appeals has\nconsolidated the two appeals and decided them together.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Stevens, supra; United States v.\nMaung, 267 F. 3d 1113, 1117 (CA11 2001); cf. United\nStates v. Cheal, 389 F. 3d 35, 51\u201353 (CA1 2004).\n   That the defendant can appeal from the earlier sentenc\ning judgment makes sense, for otherwise the statutory 90\nday restitution deadline, even when complied with, could\ndelay appeals for up to 90 days. Defendants, that is,\nwould be forced to wait three months before seeking re\nview of their conviction when they could ordinarily do so\nwithin 14 days. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b). Nonethe\nless, in light of the fact that the interaction of restitution\norders with appellate time limits could have consequences\nextending well beyond cases like the present case (where\nthere was no appeal from the initial conviction and sen\ntence), we simply note the strength of the arguments\nmilitating against the second step of petitioner\u2019s argument\nwithout deciding whether or when a party can, or must,\nappeal. We leave all such matters for another day.\n   The dissent, however, creates a rule that could ad\nversely affect not just restitution, but other sentencing\npractices beyond the narrow circumstances presented\nhere. Consider, for example, a judge who (currently lack\ning sufficient information) wishes to leave open, say, the\namount of a fine, or a special condition of supervised re\nlease. In the dissent\u2019s view, the entry of any such judg\nment would immediately deprive the judge of the author\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nity later to fill in that blank, in the absence of a statute\nspecifically providing otherwise. See post, at 1\u20134 (opinion\nof ROBERTS, C. J.). Thus, the sentencing judge would\neither have to (1) forgo the specific dollar amount or poten\ntial condition, or (2) wait to enter any judgment until all of\nthe relevant information is at hand. The former alterna\ntive would sometimes deprive judges of the power to enter\ncomponents of a sentence they may consider essential.\nThe latter alternative would require the defendant to\nwait\u2014perhaps months\u2014before taking an appeal.\n   As we have pointed out, our precedents do not currently\nplace the sentencing judge in any such dilemma. See\nsupra, at 5, 8\u20139. And we need not now depart from those\nprecedents when this case does not require us to do so;\nwhen the issue has not been adequately briefed; when the\nlower court had no opportunity to consider the argument\n(which the petitioner may well have forfeited); and when\nthe rule would foreclose the current practices of some\ndistrict courts and unnecessarily cabin the discretion they\nproperly exercise over scheduling and sentencing matters.\nCf., e.g., United States v. Stevens, supra, at 3; United\nStates v. Cheal, supra, at 47 (illustrating district court\npractices).\n   Certainly there is no need to create this rule in the\ncontext of restitution, for provisions to which the dissent\nrefers are silent about whether restitution can or cannot\nbe ordered after an initial sentencing. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a73551(b),\n(c) (\u201cA sanction authorized by [criminal forfeiture and\nrestitution statutes] may be imposed in addition to the\n[rest of the] sentence\u201d); \u00a73663A(c)(1) (mandatory orders of\nrestitution \u201cshall apply in all sentencing proceedings [for\nspecified offenses]\u201d). And even on the dissent\u2019s theory, the\nstatute elsewhere provides the necessary substantive\nauthorization: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw, when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified]\noffense . . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant\n14                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmake restitution to the victim of the offense.\u201d \u00a73663A(a)(1)\n(emphasis added). The dissent cannot explain why a\nseparate statutory provision regarding procedures as to\nwhen a \u201ccourt shall set a date for the final determination\nof the victim\u2019s losses,\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5), automatically divests a\ncourt of this distinct substantive authority. While of\ncourse that provision does not \u201cplainly\u201d confer \u201cpower to\nact after sentencing,\u201d post, at 5 (emphasis deleted), neither\ndoes it \u201cplainly\u201d remove it or require that all sentencing\nmatters be concluded at one point in time. (And the dis\nsent\u2019s assertion, see post, at 6\u2014that it uses the term \u201cau\nthority\u201d not in its \u201cjurisdictional\u201d sense, but rather in the\nsense that a court lacks \u201cauthority\u201d to \u201cimpose a sentence\nabove the maximum\u201d\u2014introduces a tenuous analogy that\nmay well confuse this Court\u2019s precedents regarding the\nterm \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d See supra, at 3\u20134.)\n   In any event, unless one reads the relevant statute\u2019s 90\nday deadline as an ironclad limit upon the judge\u2019s author\nity to make a final determination of the victim\u2019s losses, the\nstatute before us itself provides adequate authority to do\nwhat the sentencing judge did here\u2014essentially fill in an\namount-related blank in a judgment that made clear that\nrestitution was \u201capplicable.\u201d App. 49 (boldface deleted).\nSince the sentencing judge\u2019s later order did not \u201ccorrect\u201d\nan \u201cerror\u201d in the sentence, Rule 35 does not apply. Com\npare Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a) with post, at 2\u20133. Hence\nthe dissent\u2019s claim that there is no other statute that\ncreates authority (even were we to assume all else in its\nfavor, which we do not) is merely to restate the question\nposed in this case, not to answer it.\n   Moreover, the dissent\u2019s reading creates a serious statu\ntory anomaly. It reads the statute as permitting a sen\ntencing judge to order restitution for a \u201cvictim\u201d who \u201csub\nsequently discovers further losses\u201d a month, a year, or 10\nyears after entry of the original judgment, while at the\nsame time depriving that judge of the power to award\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The Court reads the statute as if\nit said \u201cthe court shall set a date for the final determina\ntion of the victim\u2019s losses, at any time after sentencing.\u201d I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  In the absence of \u00a73664(d)(5), any order of restitution\nmust be imposed at sentencing, if it is to be imposed at all.\nRestitution \u201cmay be imposed in addition to [a] sentence\u201d of\nprobation, fine, or imprisonment only if it is authorized\nunder \u00a73556.

They confer no authority to order restitution after\nsentencing has concluded. When Congress permits courts\nto impose criminal penalties at some time other than\nsentencing, it does so explicitly. See, e.g., \u00a73552(b) (provi\nsional sentence during a study period); \u00a73582(d) (authoriz\ning certain penalties \u201cin imposing a sentence . . . or at any\ntime thereafter\u201d); \u00a73583(e) (permitting extension of super\nvised release); \u00a7\u00a74244(d)\u2013(e) (provisional sentencing for\nthe mentally ill); see also Fed.

We have stated that \u201cthe trial courts had\nno such authority\u201d prior to the adoption of Rule 35, United\nStates v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178, 189, and n. 16 (1979),\nand Congress has since revoked the broad authority to\ncorrect illegal sentences originally set forth in that Rule.\nSee Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.

C. \u00a7844(a), or a mandatory order of\nrestitution, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a73663A, the Government can\nnot simply ask it to impose the correct sentence later. If\nthe error is clear, and raised within 14 days, it might be\ncorrected under Rule 35. Otherwise, the Government\nmust appeal, and seek resentencing on remand.\n\u00a7\u00a73742(b)(1), (g).\n   Section 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to these bed\nrock rules. It permits a trial court to go forward with\nsentencing while delaying any restitution order for up to\n90 days. This provision is meaningful precisely because\nrestitution must otherwise be ordered at sentencing, and\nbecause sentences are otherwise final unless properly\ncorrected. If trial courts had power to amend their sen\ntences at any time, \u00a73664(d)(5) would be unnecessary.\n   Here, however, the District Court failed to make use of\nits limited authority under \u00a73664(d)(5). Dolan was sen\ntenced on July 30, 2007. The court declined to order resti\ntution at that time or to set a date for a future restitution\norder. App. 35, 39\u201340; see also id., at 49.1 The 90-day\nperiod elapsed on October 28. At no time did the Govern\nment seek timely relief, whether under Rule 35 or by\nappeal. Cf. Corey, supra, at 174; Berman v. United States,\n302 U. S. 211, 212 (1937). Nor did it assert any claim that\nthe deadline had been lawfully extended or equitably\ntolled, an issue that I agree is not before us, see ante, at 3,\n11.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, 47a.\n   I cannot see where that court obtained authority to add\nadditional terms to Dolan\u2019s sentence. That is the step the\nCourt misses when it searches for the \u201cremedy\u201d for a\nviolation of \u00a73664(d)(5). Ante, at 1. The rule is that a trial\ncourt cannot alter a sentence after the time of sentencing.\nSection 3664(d)(5) is a limited exception to that rule. If\nthe limits are exceeded the exception does not apply, and\nthe general rule takes over\u2014the sentence cannot be\nchanged to add a restitution provision. Section 3664(d)(5)\nis self-executing: It grants authority subject to a deadline,\nand if the deadline is not met, the authority is no longer\navailable.\n   The Court appears to reason that \u00a73664(d)(5) confers the\nauthority to add a restitution provision for at least 90\ndays, and that once the camel\u2019s nose of some permitted\ndelay sneaks under the tent, any further delay is permis\nsible. Ante, at 3, 5. But that is not what \u00a73664(d)(5) says.\nIt provides 90 days for a final determination of the victims\u2019\nlosses, not a free pass to impose restitution whenever the\ntrial court gets around to it. The court had no more power\nto order restitution 269 days after sentencing than it did\nto order an additional term of imprisonment and send\nDolan back to prison.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n    To avoid this conclusion, the Court runs through a\nseries of irrelevancies that cannot trump the clear statu\ntory text. It notes, for example, that \u00a73663A provides that\n\u201c \u2018[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when\nsentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense\n. . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant make\nrestitution to the victim of the offense.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6 (quot\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ning \u00a73663A(a)(1); emphasis in Court\u2019s opinion). But the\nissue before us is when restitution should be ordered, so\nthe language the Court should underscore is \u201cwhen sen\ntencing.\u201d This provision plainly confers no power to act\nafter sentencing. Any such power attaches only by virtue\nof \u00a73663A(d), which incorporates the procedures of \u00a73664,\nincluding the limited 90-day exception. See also \u00a73556\n(\u201cThe procedures under section 3664 shall apply to all\norders of restitution under this section\u201d).\n   The Court puts greater emphasis on its reading of the\nstatute\u2019s purpose, namely to provide restitution to victims\nof crime. Certainly that was a purpose Congress sought to\npromote. But \u201cno legislation pursues its purposes at all\ncosts,\u201d and \u201cit frustrates rather than effectuates legislative\nintent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the\nstatute\u2019s primary objective must be the law.\u201d Rodriguez v.\nUnited States, 480 U. S. 522, 525\u2013526 (1987) (per curiam).\n   Congress had to balance against the interest in restitu\ntion the contrary interest in promptly determining the\ndefendant\u2019s sentence. The balance struck was clearly set\nforth in the statute: determine the victim\u2019s losses by a date\n\u201cnot to exceed 90 days after sentencing.\u201d \u00a73664(d)(5).\nWhether or not that limit was \u201cprimarily designed to help\nvictims of crime,\u201d ante, at 7, it does not cease to be law\nwhen invoked by defendants.\n   Nor can the Court find any support in the second sen\ntence of \u00a73664(d)(5). See ante, at 14\u201315. That provision\naddresses a distinct issue\u2014what to do about newly discov\nered losses\u2014and sets a higher \u201cgood cause\u201d standard. The\nfact that Congress struck the balance between restitution\nand finality differently in that context does not justify\noverriding the balance it struck here.\n   The Court also analogizes the 90-day limit to other\nprovisions discussed in our precedents, most of which have\nnothing to do with the rights of criminal defendants (for\nwhom procedural protections are of heightened impor\n6                   DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntance), let alone the finality of criminal sentencing. The\ncited cases are said to establish that an official\u2019s \u201cfailure to\nmeet [a] deadline\u201d does not always deprive that official of\n\u201cpower to act beyond it.\u201d Regions Hospital v. Shalala, 522\nU. S. 448, 459, n. 3 (1998). But the failure to comply with\n\u00a73664(d)(5) does not deprive anyone of anything: The trial\ncourt never had the general authority to alter sentences\nonce imposed, in the way that the administrative agencies\nin the cited cases were said to have general regulatory\nauthority. The trial court\u2019s authority to add a restitution\nprovision to an otherwise final sentence was conferred by\nthe very provision that limited that authority. Section\n3664(d)(5) did not take away anything that might persist\nin the absence of \u00a73664(d)(5).2\n   Even more perplexing is the Court\u2019s suggestion that\nreferences to the authority of trial courts necessarily\nimplicate questions of jurisdiction. Ante, at 14. To say\nthat a court lacks authority to order belated restitution\ndoes not use \u201cauthority\u201d in a jurisdictional sense, see\nArbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 511 (2006), but\nonly in the same sense in which a court lacks \u201cauthority\u201d\nto impose a sentence above the statutory maximum. Such\naction is an error of law, reversible on appeal, but it is not\njurisdictional. As in United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.\nEspinosa, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9), compli\nance with \u00a73664(d)(5) is \u201cnot a limitation on the . . . court\u2019s\njurisdiction,\u201d but it is a statutory \u201cprecondition to obtain\ning a [particular] order.\u201d Here that condition was not\nsatisfied.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711 (1990), is equally\n\ninapposite: The statute in that case rested the lower court\u2019s authority\non whether a bail hearing had been held at all (it had), whereas here\nthe only statutory condition is whether the losses were determined\nwithin 90 days of sentencing (they were not).\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010) \n          7\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\n                             B\n\n   In the end, the Court does not appear to need\n\u00a73664(d)(5) at all. It instead suggests that we abandon\nthe bedrock rules that sentences once imposed are final,\nand that the only exceptions are ones Congress chooses to\nallow (and Congress has allowed various ones). The Court\ninstead proposes a judicial power to alter sentences, ap\nparently at any time. But if a trial court can \u201cleave open,\nsay, the amount of a fine,\u201d ante, at 12, why not, say, the\nnumber of years? Thus, after a defendant like Dolan has\nserved his entire sentence\u2014and who knows how long\nafter?\u2014a court might still order additional imprisonment,\nadditional restitution, an additional fine, or an additional\ncondition of supervised release. See ante, at 12\u201313.\n   The Court cites no authority in support of such \u201cfill in\nth[e] blank\u201d sentencing, other than two cases implicated in\nthe Circuit split below. Ante, at 13. Prior to the enact\nment of \u00a73664(d)(5), however, it was widely recognized\nthat the requirement to impose restitution \u201cwhen sentenc\ning\u201d meant that \u201c[r]estitution must be determined at the\ntime of sentencing,\u201d and could not be left open after sen\ntencing had concluded. Federal Judicial Center, J. Wood,\nGuideline Sentencing: An Outline of Appellate Case Law\non Selected Issues, p. 300 (Sept. 2002) (emphasis added;\nciting United States v. Porter, 41 F. 3d 68, 71 (CA2 1994);\nUnited States v. Ramilo, 986 F. 2d 333, 335\u2013336 (CA9\n1993); United States v. Prendergast, 979 F. 2d 1289, 1293\n(CA8 1992); United States v. Sasnett, 925 F. 2d 392, 398\u2013\n399 (CA11 1991)).\n   The Court finds Rule 35(a) inapplicable because the\nDistrict Court was not \u201c \u2018correct[ing]\u2019 \u201d a clear error in the\nsentence. Ante, at 14. True enough; but that is why the\nGovernment should lose. The limitation of Rule 35(a) to\nclear errors, corrected within 14 days of sentencing, does\nnot leave trial courts free to make other changes to sen\ntences whenever they choose. Rule 35(a) only makes sense\n8                DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nagainst a background rule that trial courts cannot change\nsentences at will.\n   The same is true of \u00a73552(b), which empowers a court\nthat does not wish to delay sentencing but \u201cdesires more\ninformation than is otherwise available to it\u201d to impose a\nprovisional sentence during a 120-day study period. That\nstatute would be largely unnecessary if a trial court could\ndo the same by order.\n   In Addonizio, 442 U. S., at 189, we thought it noncon\ntroversial that a sentence once imposed is final, subject to\nsuch exceptions as Congress has allowed. Contrary to the\nCourt\u2019s suggestion, ante, at 13, Dolan invoked that princi\nple both here and below. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 13,\n15\u201318, 20, 29, 33, and n. 14, 36, 48, and n. 19; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 1, 5\u20138; Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief in No. 08\u2013\n2104 (CA10), pp. 12\u201313 (citing United States v. Blackwell,\n81 F. 3d 945, 949 (CA10 1996), for the proposition that a\n\u201cdistrict court does not have inherent authority to modify\na sentence\u201d). That the Court finds it necessary to question\nthat principle\u2014indeed, to accuse this dissent of \u201ccreat[ing]\nth[e] rule,\u201d ante, at 13\u2014highlights how misguided its\ndecision is.\n   To counter the effects of its opinion and to restore some\nsemblance of finality to sentencing, the Court advises\ndefendants to seek mandamus\u2014a remedy we have de\nscribed as \u201cdrastic and extraordinary,\u201d \u201creserved for really\nextraordinary causes,\u201d and one of \u201cthe most potent weap\nons in the judicial arsenal.\u201d Cheney v. United States Dist.\nCourt for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380 (2004) (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). What an odd procedure the Court\ncontemplates! A defendant, who should have received a\nharsher sentence, is to invoke the drastic and extraordi\nnary remedy of mandamus, to make sure he gets it. That\nis not how sentencing errors are corrected: If the trial\ncourt fails to order the appropriate sentence, the Govern\nment must appeal to correct it. It did not do so here, and\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthat ends the case. Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U. S.\n___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6).\n  Moreover, the Court\u2019s mandamus remedy only helps\ndefendants who know they are in danger of an increased\nsentence. So the Court imposes another rule, namely that\nthe trial court must explicitly \u201cleave open\u201d the precise\nsentence at the time of sentencing, ante, at 12, or must\nmake clear, \u201cprior to the deadline\u2019s expiration[,] that it\nwould order restitution\u201d at some indeterminate time, ante,\nat 1 (emphasis added). But what if the court does not\nmake the crucial announcement at sentencing, or \u201cprior to\nthe deadline\u2019s expiration\u201d? Are these judicially created\ndeadlines to be taken more seriously than those imposed\nby Congress? Or are we just back at the beginning, asking\nwhat the \u201cremedy\u201d should be for failing to meet the rele\nvant deadline?\n  The Court\u2019s suggestion to require notice of intent to\naugment the sentence at some future date may be a good\nidea. But an even better one might be to set a particular\ndate\u2014say, 90 days after sentencing\u2014on which the parties\ncould base their expectations. That was Congress\u2019s choice,\nand it should be good enough for us.\n                        *      *    *\n   The District Court in this case failed to order mandatory\nrestitution in sentencing Dolan. That was wrong. But two\nwrongs do not make a right, and that mistake gave the\ncourt no authority to amend Dolan\u2019s sentence later, be\nyond the 90 days allowed to add a sentencing term requir\ning restitution.\n   I am mindful of the fact that when a trial court blun\nders, the victims may suffer. Consequences like that are\nthe unavoidable result of having a system of rules. If no\none appeals a mistaken ruling on the amount of restitu\ntion (or whether restitution applies at all), finality will\nnecessarily obstruct the victims\u2019 full recovery.\n10              DOLAN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  It is up to Congress to balance the competing interests\nin recovery and finality. Where\u2014as here\u2014it has done so\nclearly, the \u201cjudicial inquiry is complete.\u201d Barnhart v.\nSigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 462 (2002) (internal quo\ntation marks omitted).\n</pre>",
