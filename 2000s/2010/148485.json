Argued February 22, 2010\u2014Decided June 14, 2010\nRespondent Ratliff was Ruby Kills Ree\u2019s attorney in Ree\u2019s successful\n  suit against the United States Social Security Administration for So\u00ad\n  cial Security benefits. The District Court granted Ree\u2019s unopposed\n  motion for attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act\n  (EAJA), which provides, inter alia, that \u201ca court shall award to a pre\u00ad\n  vailing party . . . fees and other expenses . . . in any civil action . . .\n  brought by or against the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)(1)(A).\n  Before paying the fees award, the Government discovered that Ree\n  owed the United States a debt that predated the award. Accordingly,\n  it sought an administrative offset against the award under 31\n  U. S. C. \u00a73716, which subjects to offset all \u201cfunds payable by the\n  United States,\u201d \u00a73701(a)(1), to an individual who owes certain delin\u00ad\n  quent federal debts, see \u00a73701(b), unless, e.g., payment is exempted\n  by statute or regulation. See, e.g., \u00a73716(e)(2). The parties to this\n  case have not established that any such exemption applies to\n  \u00a72412(d) fees awards, which, as of 2005, are covered by the Treasury\n  Department\u2019s Offset Program (TOP). After the Government notified\n  Ree that it would apply TOP to offset her fees award against a por\u00ad\n  tion of her debt, Ratliff intervened, challenging the offset on the\n  grounds that \u00a72412(d) fees belong to a litigant\u2019s attorney and thus\n  may not be used to satisfy the litigant\u2019s federal debts. The District\n  Court held that because \u00a72412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the\n  \u201cprevailing party,\u201d not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing to\n  challenge the offset. The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that under\n  its precedent, EAJA attorney\u2019s fees are awarded to prevailing parties\u2019\n  attorneys.\nHeld: A \u00a72412(d)(1)(A) attorney\u2019s fees award is payable to the litigant\n2                          ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    and is therefore subject to an offset to satisfy the litigant\u2019s pre\u00ad\n    existing debt to the Government. Pp. 3\u201311.\n       (a) Nothing in EAJA contradicts this Court\u2019s longstanding view\n    that the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in attorney\u2019s fees statutes is a \u201cterm\n    of art\u201d that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, e.g., Buckhannon\n    Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Hu\n    man Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603. That the term has its usual\n    meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is underscored by the fact that sub\u00ad\n    section (d)(1)(B) and other provisions clearly distinguish the party\n    who receives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who per\u00ad\n    formed the work that generated the fees. The Court disagrees with\n    Ratliff\u2019s assertion that subsection (d)(1)(A)\u2019s use of the verb \u201caward\u201d\n    nonetheless renders \u00a72412(d) fees payable directly to a prevailing\n    party\u2019s attorney. The dictionaries show that, in the litigation context,\n    the transitive verb \u201caward\u201d has the settled meaning of giving or as\u00ad\n    signing by judicial decree. Its plain meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is\n    thus that the court shall \u201cgive or assign by . . . judicial determina\u00ad\n    tion\u201d to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d (here, Ree) attorney\u2019s fees in the\n    amount sought and substantiated under, inter alia, subsection\n    (d)(1)(B). That the prevailing party\u2019s attorney may have a beneficial\n    interest or a contractual right in the fees does not alter this conclu\u00ad\n    sion. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) The Court rejects Ratliff\u2019s argument that other EAJA provi\u00ad\n    sions, combined with the Social Security Act (SSA) and the Govern\u00ad\n    ment\u2019s practice of paying some EAJA fees awards directly to attor\u00ad\n    neys in Social Security cases, render \u00a72412(d) at least ambiguous on\n    the question presented here, and that these other provisions resolve\n    the ambiguity in her favor. Even accepting that \u00a72412(d) is ambigu\u00ad\n    ous\u00b8 the provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion. Subsection (d)(1)(B) and other provisions differ\u00ad\n    entiate between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attorneys\n    on par with other service providers, in a manner that forecloses the\n    conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsec\u00ad\n    tion (d)(1)(A) awards. Nor is the necessity of such payments estab\u00ad\n    lished by the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies. That SSA fees\n    awards are payable directly to a prevailing claimant\u2019s attorney, see\n    42 U. S. C. \u00a7406(b)(1)(A), undermines Ratliff\u2019s case by showing that\n    Congress knows how to create a direct fee requirement where it de\u00ad\n    sires to do so. Given the stark contrast between the language of the\n    SSA and EAJA provisions, the Court is reluctant to interpret subsec\u00ad\n    tion (d)(1)(A) to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual\n    evidence that such a requirement applies. Such evidence is not sup\u00ad\n    plied by a 1985 EAJA amendment requiring that, \u201cwhere the claim\u00ad\n    ant\u2019s attorney receives fees for the same work under both [42 U. S. C.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  \u00a7406(b) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)], the . . . attorney [must] refun[d] to\n  the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.\u201d See note following\n  \u00a72412. Ratliff\u2019s argument that this recognition that an attorney will\n  sometimes \u201creceiv[e]\u201d \u00a72412(d) fees suggests that subsection (d)(1)(A)\n  should be construed to incorporate the same direct payments to at\u00ad\n  torneys that the SSA expressly authorizes gives more weight to \u201cre\u00ad\n  cei[pt]\u201d than the term can bear: The ensuing reference to the attor\u00ad\n  ney\u2019s obligation to \u201crefund\u201d the smaller fee to the claimant\n  demonstrates that the award belongs to the claimant in the first\n  place. Moreover, Ratliff\u2019s reading is irreconcilable with the textual\n  differences between the two Acts. The fact that the Government, un\u00ad\n  til 2006, frequently paid EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in\n  SSA cases in which the prevailing party had assigned the attorney\n  her rights in the award does not alter the Court\u2019s interpretation of\n  the Act\u2019s fees provision. That some such cases involved a prevailing\n  party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising, given that it\n  was not until 2005 that the TOP was modified to require offsets\n  against attorney\u2019s fees awards. And as Ratliff admits, the Govern\u00ad\n  ment has since discontinued the direct payment practice except in\n  cases where the plaintiff does not owe a federal debt and has as\u00ad\n  signed her right to fees to the attorney. Finally, the Court\u2019s conclu\u00ad\n  sion is buttressed by cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71988, which contains language virtually identical to \u00a72412(d)(1)(A)\u2019s.\n  See, e.g., Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U. S. 717, 730\u2212732, and n. 19.

ASTRUE, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL\n SECURITY, PETITIONER v. CATHERINE G. RATLIFF\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 14, 2010]\n\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n    Section 204(d) of the Equal Access to Justice Act\n(EAJA), codified in 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d), provides in perti\nnent part that \u201ca court shall award to a prevailing party\n. . . fees and other expenses . . . in any civil action . . .\nbrought by or against the United States . . . unless the\ncourt finds that the position of the United States was\nsubstantially justified.\u201d We consider whether an award of\n\u201cfees and other expenses\u201d to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under\n\u00a72412(d) is payable to the litigant or to his attorney. We\nhold that a \u00a72412(d) fees award is payable to the litigant\nand is therefore subject to a Government offset to satisfy a\npre-existing debt that the litigant owes the United States.\n                             I\n  This case arises out of proceedings in which a Social\nSecurity claimant, Ruby Willows Kills Ree, prevailed on a\nclaim for benefits against the United States. Respondent\nCatherine Ratliff was Ree\u2019s attorney in those proceedings.\nThe District Court granted Ree\u2019s unopposed motion for a\n\u00a72412(d) fees award in the amount of $2,112.60. Before\nthe United States paid the fees award, however, it discov\n2                       ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nered that Ree owed the Government a debt that predated\nthe District Court\u2019s approval of the award. Accordingly,\nthe United States sought an administrative offset against\nthe fees award to satisfy part of that debt.\n  The Government\u2019s authority to use administrative\noffsets is statutory. See 31 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73711(a), 3716(a)\n(authorizing an agency whose debt collection attempts are\nunsuccessful to \u201ccollect the claim by administrative off\nset\u201d).1 Congress has subjected to offset all \u201cfunds payable\nby the United States,\u201d \u00a73701(a)(1), to an individual who\nowes certain delinquent federal debts, see \u00a73701(b),\nunless, as relevant here, payment is exempted by statute,\nsee \u00a73716(e)(2). No such exemption applies to attorney\u2019s\nfees awards under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)(1)(A) (hereinafter\nsubsection (d)(1)(A)), which are otherwise subject to offset,\nsee 31 CFR \u00a7285.5(e)(1) (2009), and which, as of January\n2005, are covered by the Treasury Offset Program (TOP)\noperated by the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Man\nagement Service (FMS). See Brief for Petitioner 4 (ex\nplaining TOP\u2019s extension to cover so-called \u201c \u2018miscellane\nous\u2019 \u201d payments that include attorney\u2019s fees payments\nthe Treasury Department makes on behalf of federal\nagencies).2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Section\n           3701 defines an administrative offset as \u201cwithholding funds\npayable by the United States\u201d to the debtor. \u00a73701(a)(1). An agency\nmay effect such an offset by cooperating with another agency to with\nhold such funds, or by notifying the Treasury Department of the debt so\nTreasury may include it in Treasury\u2019s centralized offset program. See\n31 CFR \u00a7\u00a7285.5(d)(2), 901.3(b)(1), (c). Alternatively, the Treasury\nDepartment may attempt an administrative offset after receiving notice\nfrom a creditor agency that a legally enforceable nontax debt has\nbecome more than 180 days delinquent. See 31 U. S. C. \u00a73716(c)(6); 31\nCFR \u00a7\u00a7285.5(d)(1), 901.3(b)(1).\n  2 Respondent Ratliff argues for the first time in her merits brief be\n\nfore this Court that the 2005 amendments to the FMS regulations\nexempt the EAJA fees award in this case from administrative offset\nagainst Ree\u2019s outstanding federal debt. See Brief for Respondent 8, 46\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In this case, the Government, relying on the TOP, noti\nfied Ree that the Government would apply her \u00a72412(d)\nfees award to offset a portion of her outstanding federal\ndebt. Ratliff intervened to challenge the offset on the\ngrounds that \u00a72412(d) fees belong to a litigant\u2019s attorney\nand thus may not be used to offset or otherwise satisfy a\nlitigant\u2019s federal debts. The District Court held that\nbecause \u00a72412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the pre\nvailing party, not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing\nto challenge the Government\u2019s proposed offset. See No.\nCIV. 06\u20135070\u2013RHB, 2007 WL 6894710, *1 (D SD, May 10,\n2007).\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.\n540 F. 3d 800 (2008). It held that under Circuit precedent,\n\u201cEAJA attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded to prevailing parties\u2019\nattorneys.\u201d Id., at 802. The Court of Appeals recognized\nthat its decision did not accord with a \u201cliteral interpreta\ntion of the EAJA,\u201d ibid., and exacerbated a split among the\nCourts of Appeals, compare id., at 801\u2013802, with, e.g.,\nReeves v. Astrue, 526 F. 3d 732, 733 (CA11 2008); Manning\nv. Astrue, 510 F. 3d 1246, 1249\u20131251 (CA10 2007); FDL\nTechnologies, Inc. v. United States, 967 F. 2d 1578, 1580\n(CA Fed. 1992); Panola Land Buying Assn. v. Clark, 844\nF. 2d 1506, 1510\u20131511 (CA11 1988).3 We granted certio\nrari. 557 U. S. ___ (2009).\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(citing 31 CFR \u00a7285.5(e)(5)). We need not decide this question because\nRatliff did not raise the regulations as a bar to offset in her brief in\nopposition to the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, see this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 15.2, or in the proceedings below.\n   3 The split exists in the Social Security context because the Social\n\nSecurity Act (SSA), 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7301 et seq.,\nprovides for payment of attorney\u2019s fees awards directly to counsel, see\n\u00a7406(b)(1)(A), and until 2006 the Government in many cases treated\nfees awards under EAJA the same way, see Reply Brief for Petitioner\n13\u221214.\n4                     ASTRUE v. RATLIFF \n\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              II \n\n   Subsection (d)(1)(A) directs that courts \u201cshall award to a\nprevailing party . . . fees and other expenses . . . incurred\nby that party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We have long held that\nthe term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in fee statutes is a \u201cterm of\nart\u201d that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, e.g., Buck\nhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of\nHealth and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001).\nThis treatment reflects the fact that statutes that award\nattorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party are exceptions to the\n\u201c \u2018American Rule\u2019 \u201d that each litigant \u201cbear [his] own attor\nney\u2019s fees.\u201d Id., at 602 (citing Key Tronic Corp. v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 809, 819 (1994)). Nothing in EAJA sup\nports a different reading. Cf. Arthur Andersen LLP v.\nCarlisle, 556 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2009) (slip op., at 6, n. 4)\n(where Congress employs \u201cidentical words and phrases\nwithin the same statute,\u201d they are presumed to carry \u201cthe\nsame meaning\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nIndeed, other subsections within \u00a72412(d) underscore that\nthe term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in subsection (d)(1)(A) carries\nits usual and settled meaning\u2014prevailing litigant. Those\nother subsections clearly distinguish the party who re\nceives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who\nperformed the work that generated the fees. See, e.g.,\n\u00a72412(d)(1)(B) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(B)) (the \u201cpre\nvailing party\u201d must apply for the fees award and \u201csho[w]\u201d\nthat he \u201cis a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an\naward\u201d by, among other things, submitting \u201can itemized\nstatement from any attorney . . . representing or appearing\nin behalf of the party\u201d that details the attorney\u2019s hourly\nrate and time spent on the case (emphasis added)); see\nalso Part III, infra.\n   Ratliff nonetheless asserts that subsection (d)(1)(A)\u2019s\nuse of the verb \u201caward\u201d renders \u00a72412(d) fees payable\ndirectly to a prevailing party\u2019s attorney and thus protects\nthe fees from a Government offset against the prevailing\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The plain\nmeaning of the word \u201caward\u201d in subsection (d)(1)(A) is\nthus that the court shall \u201cgive or assign by . . . judicial\ndetermination\u201d to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d (here, Ratliff\u2019s\nclient Ree) attorney\u2019s fees in the amount sought and sub\nstantiated under, inter alia, subsection (d)(1)(B).\n    Ratliff\u2019s contrary argument does not withstand scrutiny.\nAccording to Ratliff, subsection (d)(1)(B), which uses \u201cthe\nnoun \u2018award\u2019 \u201d to mean a \u201c \u2018decision,\u2019 \u201d requires us to con\nstrue subsection (d)(1)(A) (which uses \u201caward\u201d as a verb)\nto mean that \u201c[o]nly the prevailing party may receive the\naward (the decision granting fees), but only the attorney\nwho earned the fee (the payment asked or given for profes\nsional services) is entitled to receive it.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 16, 15 (emphasis in original; some internal quotation\nmarks and footnote omitted). This argument ignores the\nsettled definitions above, and even the definitions Ratliff\nproffers, because each makes clear that the verb \u201caward\u201d\nin subsection (d)(1)(A) means to \u201cgive by the decision of a\nlaw court\u201d or to \u201cgrant . . . by judicial decree,\u201d not simply to\n\u201cgive a decision\u201d itself. Id., at 16, and n. 39 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted). We thus agree\nwith the Government that under the statutory language\nhere, the \u201cjudicial decision is the means by which the court\nconfers a right to payment upon the prevailing party; it is\nnot itself the thing that the court gives (or orders the\n6                    ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant to give) to the party.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n4 (emphasis in original) (citing Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S.\n755, 761 (1987) (explaining that \u201c[i]n all civil litigation,\nthe judicial decree is not the end but the means\u201d)). This\nsettled and natural construction of the operative statutory\nlanguage is reflected in our cases. See, e.g., Scarborough\nv. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 405 (2004) (\u201cEAJA authorizes\nthe payment of fees to a prevailing party\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Ratliff\u2019s final textual argument\u2014that subsection\n(d)(1)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d itself establishes\nthat the fees are payable to the prevailing party\u2019s attor\nney, see Brief for Respondent 19\u221222\u2014proves far too much.\nThe fact that the statute awards to the prevailing party\nfees in which her attorney may have a beneficial interest\nor a contractual right does not establish that the statute\n\u201cawards\u201d the fees directly to the attorney. For the reasons\nwe have explained, the statute\u2019s plain text does the oppo\nsite\u2014it \u201cawards\u201d the fees to the litigant, and thus subjects\nthem to a federal administrative offset if the litigant has\noutstanding federal debts.\n                            III\n  In an effort to avoid the Act\u2019s plain meaning, Ratliff\nargues that other provisions of EAJA, combined with the\nSSA and the Government\u2019s practice of paying some EAJA\nfees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases,\nrender \u00a72412(d) at least ambiguous on the question pre\nsented here, and that these other provisions resolve the\nambiguity in her favor. Again we disagree. Even accept\ning \u00a72412(d) as ambiguous on the question presented, the\nprovisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter our\nconclusion that EAJA fees are payable to litigants and are\nthus subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding\nfederal debts.\n  To begin with, \u00a72412(d)(1)\u2019s provisions differentiate\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attor\nneys on par with other service providers, in a manner that\nforecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to\ndirect payment of subsection (d)(1)(A) awards. As noted\nabove, subsection (d)(1)(B) requires the prevailing party to\nsubmit a fee application showing that she is otherwise\n\u201celigible to receive an award\u201d and, as a complement to that\nrequirement, compels the prevailing party to submit \u201can\nitemized statement from any attorney . . . representing or\nappearing in behalf of the party\u201d that details the attorney\u2019s\nhourly rate and time the attorney spent on the case.\n(Emphasis added.) This language would make little sense\nif, as Ratliff contends, \u00a72412(d)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d lan\nguage effectively refers to the prevailing litigant\u2019s attor\nney. Subsection (d)(1)(B) similarly makes clear that the\n\u201cprevailing party\u201d (not her attorney) is the recipient of the\nfees award by requiring the prevailing party to demon\nstrate that her net worth falls within the range the statute\nrequires for fees awards. And EAJA\u2019s cost provision fur\nther underscores the point. That provision uses language\nidentical to that in the attorney\u2019s fees provision to allow\nprevailing parties to recover \u201cthe reasonable expenses of\nexpert witnesses\u201d and \u201cany study, analysis, engineering\nreport, test, or project\u201d necessary to prepare \u201cthe party\u2019s\ncase,\u201d \u00a72412(d)(2)(A), yet Ratliff does not argue that it\nmakes costs payable directly to the vendors who provide\nthe relevant services.\n   Nor do the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies estab\nlish that subsection (d)(1)(A) fees awards are payable to\nprevailing parties\u2019 attorneys. It is true that the SSA\nmakes fees awards under that statute payable directly to a\nprevailing claimant\u2019s attorney.           See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7406(b)(1)(A) (providing that where a claimant \u201cwho was\nrepresented before the court by an attorney\u201d obtains a\nfavorable judgment, \u201cthe court may determine and allow\nas part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such represen\n8                   ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntation, not in excess of 25 percent of\u201d the benefits award\nand may certify the full amount of the statutory fees\naward \u201cfor payment to such attorney out of, and not in\naddition to, the amount of\u201d the claimant\u2019s benefits award\n(emphasis added)). But the SSA\u2019s express authorization of\nsuch payments undermines Ratliff\u2019s case insofar as it\nshows that Congress knows how to make fees awards\npayable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so.\nGiven the stark contrast between the SSA\u2019s express au\nthorization of direct payments to attorneys and the ab\nsence of such language in subsection (d)(1)(A), we are\nreluctant to interpret the latter provision to contain a\ndirect fee requirement absent clear textual evidence sup\nporting such an interpretation.\n   Ratliff contends that Congress\u2019 1985 amendments to\n\u00a7206(b) of EAJA supply just such evidence, at least in\nSocial Security cases. See \u00a73(2), 99 Stat. 186, note follow\ning 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412. The 1985 amendments address the\nfact that Social Security claimants may be eligible to\nreceive fees awards under both the SSA and EAJA, and\nclarify the procedure that attorneys and their clients must\nfollow to prevent the windfall of an unauthorized double\nrecovery of fees for the same work. Section 206(b) pro\nvides that no violation of law occurs \u201cif, where the claim\nant\u2019s attorney receives fees for the same work under both\n[42 U. S. C. \u00a7406(b) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)], the claim\nant\u2019s attorney refunds to the claimant the amount of the\nsmaller fee.\u201d According to Ratliff, the fact that \u00a7206(b)\nrecognizes, or at least assumes, that an attorney will\nsometimes \u201creceiv[e]\u201d fees under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)\nsuggests that we should construe subsection (d)(1)(A) to\nincorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that\nthe SSA expressly authorizes.\n   This argument gives more weight to \u00a7206(b)\u2019s reference\nto attorney \u201crecei[pt]\u201d of fees than the reference can bear.\nSection 206(b)\u2019s ensuing reference to the attorney\u2019s obliga\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntion to \u201crefun[d]\u201d the amount of the smaller fee to the\nclaimant, which reference suggests that the award belongs\nto the claimant in the first place, alone undercuts Ratliff\u2019s\nreading of \u201creceives\u201d as implying an initial statutory pay\nment to the attorney.4 And Ratliff\u2019s reading is in any\nevent irreconcilable with the textual differences between\nEAJA and the SSA we discuss above. Thus, even accept\ning Ratliff\u2019s argument that subsection (d)(1)(A) is ambigu\nous, the statutory provisions she cites resolve any ambigu\nity in favor of treating subsection (d)(1)(A) awards as\npayable to the prevailing litigant, and thus subject to\noffset where the litigant has relevant federal debts.\n   The Government\u2019s history of paying EAJA awards di\nrectly to attorneys in certain cases does not compel a\ndifferent conclusion. The Government concedes that until\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Ratliffargues that fees awarded under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7406(b) can never\nbe \u201c \u2018refund[ed]\u2019 \u201d in this sense because SSA fees are \u201cnever paid initially\nto the client.\u201d Brief for Respondent 14 (emphasis in original). That is\nnot accurate. As we have explained, Social Security claimants and\nattorneys normally enter into contingent-fee agreements that are\nsubject to judicial \u201creview for reasonableness.\u201d Gisbrecht v. Barnhart,\n535 U. S. 789, 809 (2002). Where the court allows a fee, \u00a7406(b) per\nmits the Commissioner to collect the approved fee out of the client\u2019s\nbenefit award and to certify the fee for \u201cpayment to such attorney out\nof\u201d that award. \u00a7406(b)(1)(A). In such cases, the attorney would\n\u201crefun[d]\u201d the fee to the client in the event that the attorney also\nreceives a (larger) EAJA award, because the attorney \u201creceive[d]\u201d the\nSSA fee from the client\u2019s funds. Similarly inaccurate is Ratliff\u2019s sugges\ntion that our construction of EAJA \u00a7206(b)\u2019s reference to \u201crefun[d]\u201d\nwould preclude attorneys from collecting any fees from a prevailing\nparty until both SSA and EAJA payments are awarded. Our construc\ntion does not alter or preclude what we have recognized as courts\u2019\ncommon practice of awarding EAJA fees at the time a court remands a\ncase to the Social Security Administration (Administration) for benefits\nproceedings. Such awards often allow attorneys to collect EAJA fees\nmonths before any fees are awarded under 42 U. S.C \u00a7406(b), because\n\u00a7406(b) fees cannot be determined until the Administration enters a\nfinal benefits ruling. See Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U. S. 292, 295\u2212302\n(1993).\n10                        ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n2006, it \u201cfrequently paid EAJA fees in Social Security\ncases directly to attorneys.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 13.\nBut this fact does not alter our interpretation of subsec\ntion (d)(1)(A)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d language or the Govern\nment\u2019s rights and obligations under the statute. As the\nGovernment explains, it most often paid EAJA fees di\nrectly to attorneys in cases in which the prevailing party\nhad assigned its rights in the fees award to the attorney\n(which assignment would not be necessary if the statute\nrendered the fees award payable to the attorney in the\nfirst instance). The fact that some such cases involved a\nprevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsur\nprising given that it was not until 2005 that the Treasury\nDepartment modified the TOP to require offsets against\n\u201cmiscellaneous\u201d payments such as attorney\u2019s fees awards.\nAnd as Ratliff admits, the Government has since contin\nued the direct payment practice only in cases where \u201cthe\nplaintiff does not owe a debt to the government and as\nsigns the right to receive the fees to the attorney.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 28 (boldface deleted). The Government\u2019s\ndecision to continue direct payments only in such cases is\neasily explained by the 2005 amendments to the TOP, and\nnothing about the Government\u2019s past payment practices\naltered the statutory text that governs this case or es\ntopped the Government from conforming its payment\npractices to the Treasury Department\u2019s revised regula\ntions. For all of these reasons, neither EAJA nor the SSA\nsupports Ratliff\u2019s reading of subsection (d)(1)(A).\n   Our cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988,\nwhich contains language virtually identical to the EAJA\nprovision we address here,5 buttress this conclusion. Our\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Section 1988(b) provides that in actions covered by the statute and\nsubject to exceptions not relevant here, \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fee.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmost recent cases applying \u00a71988(b)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d\nlanguage recognize the practical reality that attorneys are\nthe beneficiaries and, almost always, the ultimate recipi\nents of the fees that the statute awards to \u201cprevailing\npart[ies].\u201d See, e.g., Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 86\n(1990). But these cases emphasize the nonstatutory (con\ntractual and other assignment-based) rights that typically\nconfer upon the attorney the entitlement to payment of\nthe fees award the statute confers on the prevailing liti\ngant. As noted above, these kinds of arrangements would\nbe unnecessary if, as Ratliff contends, statutory fees lan\nguage like that in \u00a71988(b) and EAJA provides attorneys\nwith a statutory right to direct payment of awards. Hence\nour conclusion that \u201cthe party, rather than the lawyer,\u201d\nid., at 87, is \u201centitle[d] to receive the fees\u201d under \u00a71988(b),\nid., at 88, and that the statute \u201ccontrols what the losing\ndefendant must pay, not what the prevailing plaintiff\nmust pay his lawyer,\u201d id., at 90; see also Evans v.

S. C. \u00a72412(d) is payable to the prevailing litigant\nrather than the attorney. The EAJA does not legally\nobligate the Government to pay a prevailing litigant\u2019s\nattorney, and the litigant\u2019s obligation to pay her attorney\nis controlled not by the EAJA but by contract and the law\ngoverning that contract. That conclusion, however, does\nnot answer the question whether Congress intended the\nGovernment to deduct moneys from EAJA fee awards to\noffset a litigant\u2019s pre-existing and unrelated debt, as the\nTreasury Department began to do only in 2005 pursuant\nto its authority under the Debt Collection Improvement\nAct of 1996 (DCIA). In my view, it is likely both that\nCongress did not consider that question and that, had it\ndone so, it would not have wanted EAJA fee awards to be\nsubject to offset. Because such offsets undercut the effec\ntiveness of the EAJA and cannot be justified by reference\nto the DCIA\u2019s text or purpose, it seems probable that\nCongress would have made, and perhaps will in the future\nmake, the opposite choice if clearly presented with it.\n   In enacting the EAJA, Congress found \u201cthat certain\n2                       ASTRUE v.

The point of an award of attorney\u2019s fees, after\nall, is to enable a prevailing litigant to pay her attorney.\nSee, e.g., Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 285 (1989)\n(\u201cWe . . . take as our starting point the self-evident propo\nsition that the \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 provided by [42\nU. S.

RATLIFF\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nsense that increasing the risk that an attorney will not\nreceive a fee award will inevitably decrease the willing\nness of attorneys to undertake representation in these\nkinds of cases.\n  Second, the Government contends that any disincentive\nthe fear of administrative offset may create is mitigated in\nthe Social Security context by the Social Security Act\u2019s\nindependent provision authorizing a fee award payable\ndirectly to the attorney. See id., at 17\u201318 (citing 42\nU. S. C. \u00a7406(b)(1)(A)). But as the Government acknowl\nedges, the \u201cEAJA\u2019s fee-shifting provisions are potentially\nmore generous than [the Social Security Act\u2019s] in at least\nthree respects\u201d: (1) A court may not award attorney\u2019s fees\nunder the Social Security Act, but may under the EAJA,\nwhen the claimant wins only a procedural victory and does\nnot obtain any past-due benefits; (2) fees under the Social\nSecurity Act are limited to a percentage of benefits\nawarded, while EAJA fees are calculated under the lode\nstar method by examining the attorney\u2019s reasonable hours\nexpended and her reasonable hourly rate; and (3) in con\ntrast to the Social Security Act, fees may be awarded\nunder the EAJA in addition to, rather than out of, the\nbenefits awarded. Brief for Petitioner 6\u20137. EAJA awards\nthus provide an important additional incentive for attor\nneys to undertake Social Security cases.\n  Finally, the Government argues that lawyers can easily\ndetermine at the outset whether a potential client owes\nthe Government a debt and can then assist the client in\nestablishing a written repayment plan that would prevent\nan offset. Reply Brief for Petitioner 18. At oral argument,\nhowever, the Government acknowledged that it was not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnot contest the number for Social Security cases but suggested that the\npercentage of veteran\u2019s benefits cases resulting in EAJA awards is\ncloser to 50% or 60%. Id., at 52. Under either estimate, these are\nhardly vanishing odds of success for an attorney deciding whether to\ntake a client\u2019s case.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313. It is not\ndifficult to understand why. Helping a client establish a\nrepayment plan would be a time-consuming endeavor\nuncompensated by any fee-shifting provision, and a client\nwho needs such assistance is unlikely to have the funds to\npay the attorney for that service. If the Government is\ninstead suggesting that a lawyer can simply decline to\nrepresent a prospective client once she knows of the cli\nent\u2019s debtor status, that suggestion only proves my point.\nCf. NOSSCR Brief 25 (describing deterrent effect of offsets\non representation).\n   In the end, the Government has no compelling response\nto the fact that today\u2019s decision will make it more difficult\nfor the neediest litigants to find attorneys to represent\nthem in cases against the Government. I \u201cfind it difficult\nto ascribe to Congress an intent to throw\u201d an EAJA liti\ngant \u201ca lifeline that it knew was a foot short. . . . Given the\nanomalous nature of this result, and its frustration of the\nvery purposes behind the EAJA itself, Congress cannot\nlightly be assumed to have intended it.\u201d Sullivan, 490\nU. S., at 890.\n   The Government suggests that it is possible to glean\nsuch intent from the fact that Congress did not expressly\nexempt EAJA awards from administrative offset under the\nDCIA.

If \u201capplication of the offset program to such\nawards will make it more difficult for Social Security\nclaimants or other litigants to find attorneys,\u201d the Gov\nernment contends, the \u201cprovisions that govern the offset\nprogram indicate that Congress is willing to bear that\n6                    ASTRUE v.

For more than two dec\nades after the EAJA was enacted in 1980, the Commis\nsioner of Social Security \u201cconsistently paid\u201d EAJA fee\nawards directly to the attorney, not the prevailing party.\nStephens ex rel. R. E. v. Astrue, 565 F. 3d 131, 135 (CA4\n2009); see also Bryant v. Commissioner of Social Security,\n578 F. 3d 443, 446 (CA6 2009); cf. ante, at 3, n. 3, 9\u201310.\n\u201cIn fact, the Commissioner created a direct deposit system\nfor attorneys and issued [Internal Revenue Service] 1099\nforms directly to the attorneys who received awards, not\ning the awards as taxable attorney income.\u201d Stephens, 565\nF. 3d, at 135. Not until 2005, when the Treasury Depart\nment extended the offset program to cover \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d\nfederal payments, including \u201cfees,\u201d did the Commissioner\ncease paying EAJA fee awards directly to attorneys and\nadopt the position that the awards were appropriately\nconsidered the property of the prevailing party. Id., at 136\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bryant, 578\nF. 3d, at 446; ante, at 2, 10. Congress therefore had no\nreason to include a specific exemption of EAJA fee awards\n(in the Social Security context or otherwise) from the offset\nprogram when it enacted the DCIA in 1996.\n   I am further reluctant to conclude that Congress would\nwant EAJA fee awards to be offset for a prevailing liti\ngant\u2019s unrelated debts because it is not likely to effectuate\nthe DCIA\u2019s purpose of \u201cmaximiz[ing] collections of delin\nquent debts owed to the Government by ensuring quick\naction to enforce recovery of debts and the use of all ap\npropriate collection tools.\u201d \u00a731001(b)(1), 110 Stat. 1321\u2013\n358. This purpose would be better served if claimants are\nable to find attorneys to help them secure the benefits\nthey are rightfully owed in the first place, thereby making\navailable a source of funds to permit repayment of the\nclaimants\u2019 Government debts at all.

Argued February 22, 2010\u2014Decided June 14, 2010\nRespondent Ratliff was Ruby Kills Ree\u2019s attorney in Ree\u2019s successful\n  suit against the United States Social Security Administration for So\u00ad\n  cial Security benefits. The District Court granted Ree\u2019s unopposed\n  motion for attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act\n  (EAJA), which provides, inter alia, that \u201ca court shall award to a pre\u00ad\n  vailing party . . . fees and other expenses . . . in any civil action . . .\n  brought by or against the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)(1)(A).\n  Before paying the fees award, the Government discovered that Ree\n  owed the United States a debt that predated the award. Accordingly,\n  it sought an administrative offset against the award under 31\n  U. S. C. \u00a73716, which subjects to offset all \u201cfunds payable by the\n  United States,\u201d \u00a73701(a)(1), to an individual who owes certain delin\u00ad\n  quent federal debts, see \u00a73701(b), unless, e.g., payment is exempted\n  by statute or regulation. See, e.g., \u00a73716(e)(2). The parties to this\n  case have not established that any such exemption applies to\n  \u00a72412(d) fees awards, which, as of 2005, are covered by the Treasury\n  Department\u2019s Offset Program (TOP). After the Government notified\n  Ree that it would apply TOP to offset her fees award against a por\u00ad\n  tion of her debt, Ratliff intervened, challenging the offset on the\n  grounds that \u00a72412(d) fees belong to a litigant\u2019s attorney and thus\n  may not be used to satisfy the litigant\u2019s federal debts. The District\n  Court held that because \u00a72412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the\n  \u201cprevailing party,\u201d not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing to\n  challenge the offset. The Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that under\n  its precedent, EAJA attorney\u2019s fees are awarded to prevailing parties\u2019\n  attorneys.\nHeld: A \u00a72412(d)(1)(A) attorney\u2019s fees award is payable to the litigant\n2                          ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    and is therefore subject to an offset to satisfy the litigant\u2019s pre\u00ad\n    existing debt to the Government. Pp. 3\u201311.\n       (a) Nothing in EAJA contradicts this Court\u2019s longstanding view\n    that the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in attorney\u2019s fees statutes is a \u201cterm\n    of art\u201d that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, e.g., Buckhannon\n    Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Hu\n    man Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603. That the term has its usual\n    meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is underscored by the fact that sub\u00ad\n    section (d)(1)(B) and other provisions clearly distinguish the party\n    who receives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who per\u00ad\n    formed the work that generated the fees. The Court disagrees with\n    Ratliff\u2019s assertion that subsection (d)(1)(A)\u2019s use of the verb \u201caward\u201d\n    nonetheless renders \u00a72412(d) fees payable directly to a prevailing\n    party\u2019s attorney. The dictionaries show that, in the litigation context,\n    the transitive verb \u201caward\u201d has the settled meaning of giving or as\u00ad\n    signing by judicial decree. Its plain meaning in subsection (d)(1)(A) is\n    thus that the court shall \u201cgive or assign by . . . judicial determina\u00ad\n    tion\u201d to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d (here, Ree) attorney\u2019s fees in the\n    amount sought and substantiated under, inter alia, subsection\n    (d)(1)(B). That the prevailing party\u2019s attorney may have a beneficial\n    interest or a contractual right in the fees does not alter this conclu\u00ad\n    sion. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) The Court rejects Ratliff\u2019s argument that other EAJA provi\u00ad\n    sions, combined with the Social Security Act (SSA) and the Govern\u00ad\n    ment\u2019s practice of paying some EAJA fees awards directly to attor\u00ad\n    neys in Social Security cases, render \u00a72412(d) at least ambiguous on\n    the question presented here, and that these other provisions resolve\n    the ambiguity in her favor. Even accepting that \u00a72412(d) is ambigu\u00ad\n    ous\u00b8 the provisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion. Subsection (d)(1)(B) and other provisions differ\u00ad\n    entiate between attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attorneys\n    on par with other service providers, in a manner that forecloses the\n    conclusion that attorneys have a right to direct payment of subsec\u00ad\n    tion (d)(1)(A) awards. Nor is the necessity of such payments estab\u00ad\n    lished by the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies. That SSA fees\n    awards are payable directly to a prevailing claimant\u2019s attorney, see\n    42 U. S. C. \u00a7406(b)(1)(A), undermines Ratliff\u2019s case by showing that\n    Congress knows how to create a direct fee requirement where it de\u00ad\n    sires to do so. Given the stark contrast between the language of the\n    SSA and EAJA provisions, the Court is reluctant to interpret subsec\u00ad\n    tion (d)(1)(A) to contain a direct fee requirement absent clear textual\n    evidence that such a requirement applies. Such evidence is not sup\u00ad\n    plied by a 1985 EAJA amendment requiring that, \u201cwhere the claim\u00ad\n    ant\u2019s attorney receives fees for the same work under both [42 U. S. C.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  \u00a7406(b) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)], the . . . attorney [must] refun[d] to\n  the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.\u201d See note following\n  \u00a72412. Ratliff\u2019s argument that this recognition that an attorney will\n  sometimes \u201creceiv[e]\u201d \u00a72412(d) fees suggests that subsection (d)(1)(A)\n  should be construed to incorporate the same direct payments to at\u00ad\n  torneys that the SSA expressly authorizes gives more weight to \u201cre\u00ad\n  cei[pt]\u201d than the term can bear: The ensuing reference to the attor\u00ad\n  ney\u2019s obligation to \u201crefund\u201d the smaller fee to the claimant\n  demonstrates that the award belongs to the claimant in the first\n  place. Moreover, Ratliff\u2019s reading is irreconcilable with the textual\n  differences between the two Acts. The fact that the Government, un\u00ad\n  til 2006, frequently paid EAJA fees awards directly to attorneys in\n  SSA cases in which the prevailing party had assigned the attorney\n  her rights in the award does not alter the Court\u2019s interpretation of\n  the Act\u2019s fees provision. That some such cases involved a prevailing\n  party with outstanding federal debts is unsurprising, given that it\n  was not until 2005 that the TOP was modified to require offsets\n  against attorney\u2019s fees awards. And as Ratliff admits, the Govern\u00ad\n  ment has since discontinued the direct payment practice except in\n  cases where the plaintiff does not owe a federal debt and has as\u00ad\n  signed her right to fees to the attorney. Finally, the Court\u2019s conclu\u00ad\n  sion is buttressed by cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71988, which contains language virtually identical to \u00a72412(d)(1)(A)\u2019s.\n  See, e.g., Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U. S. 717, 730\u2212732, and n. 19.

Respondent\nCatherine Ratliff was Ree\u2019s attorney in those proceedings.\nThe District Court granted Ree\u2019s unopposed motion for a\n\u00a72412(d) fees award in the amount of $2,112.60. Before\nthe United States paid the fees award, however, it discov\n2                       ASTRUE v.

Accordingly,\nthe United States sought an administrative offset against\nthe fees award to satisfy part of that debt.\n  The Government\u2019s authority to use administrative\noffsets is statutory. See 31 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a73711(a), 3716(a)\n(authorizing an agency whose debt collection attempts are\nunsuccessful to \u201ccollect the claim by administrative off\nset\u201d).1 Congress has subjected to offset all \u201cfunds payable\nby the United States,\u201d \u00a73701(a)(1), to an individual who\nowes certain delinquent federal debts, see \u00a73701(b),\nunless, as relevant here, payment is exempted by statute,\nsee \u00a73716(e)(2). No such exemption applies to attorney\u2019s\nfees awards under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)(1)(A) (hereinafter\nsubsection (d)(1)(A)), which are otherwise subject to offset,\nsee 31 CFR \u00a7285.5(e)(1) (2009), and which, as of January\n2005, are covered by the Treasury Offset Program (TOP)\noperated by the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Man\nagement Service (FMS).

An agency\nmay effect such an offset by cooperating with another agency to with\nhold such funds, or by notifying the Treasury Department of the debt so\nTreasury may include it in Treasury\u2019s centralized offset program. See\n31 CFR \u00a7\u00a7285.5(d)(2), 901.3(b)(1), (c). Alternatively, the Treasury\nDepartment may attempt an administrative offset after receiving notice\nfrom a creditor agency that a legally enforceable nontax debt has\nbecome more than 180 days delinquent.

Ratliff intervened to challenge the offset on the\ngrounds that \u00a72412(d) fees belong to a litigant\u2019s attorney\nand thus may not be used to offset or otherwise satisfy a\nlitigant\u2019s federal debts. The District Court held that\nbecause \u00a72412(d) directs that fees be awarded to the pre\nvailing party, not to her attorney, Ratliff lacked standing\nto challenge the Government\u2019s proposed offset.

We need not decide this question because\nRatliff did not raise the regulations as a bar to offset in her brief in\nopposition to the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, see this\nCourt\u2019s Rule 15.2, or in the proceedings below.\n   3 The split exists in the Social Security context because the Social\n\nSecurity Act (SSA), 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7301 et seq.,\nprovides for payment of attorney\u2019s fees awards directly to counsel, see\n\u00a7406(b)(1)(A), and until 2006 the Government in many cases treated\nfees awards under EAJA the same way, see Reply Brief for Petitioner\n13\u221214.\n4                     ASTRUE v.

We have long held that\nthe term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in fee statutes is a \u201cterm of\nart\u201d that refers to the prevailing litigant. See, e.g., Buck\nhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of\nHealth and Human Resources, 532 U. S. 598, 603 (2001).\nThis treatment reflects the fact that statutes that award\nattorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party are exceptions to the\n\u201c \u2018American Rule\u2019 \u201d that each litigant \u201cbear [his] own attor\nney\u2019s fees.\u201d Id., at 602 (citing Key Tronic Corp. v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 809, 819 (1994)). Nothing in EAJA sup\nports a different reading. Cf. Arthur Andersen LLP v.\nCarlisle, 556 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2009) (slip op., at 6, n. 4)\n(where Congress employs \u201cidentical words and phrases\nwithin the same statute,\u201d they are presumed to carry \u201cthe\nsame meaning\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nIndeed, other subsections within \u00a72412(d) underscore that\nthe term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in subsection (d)(1)(A) carries\nits usual and settled meaning\u2014prevailing litigant. Those\nother subsections clearly distinguish the party who re\nceives the fees award (the litigant) from the attorney who\nperformed the work that generated the fees. See, e.g.,\n\u00a72412(d)(1)(B) (hereinafter subsection (d)(1)(B)) (the \u201cpre\nvailing party\u201d must apply for the fees award and \u201csho[w]\u201d\nthat he \u201cis a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an\naward\u201d by, among other things, submitting \u201can itemized\nstatement from any attorney . . . representing or appearing\nin behalf of the party\u201d that details the attorney\u2019s hourly\nrate and time spent on the case (emphasis added)); see\nalso Part III, infra.\n   Ratliff nonetheless asserts that subsection (d)(1)(A)\u2019s\nuse of the verb \u201caward\u201d renders \u00a72412(d) fees payable\ndirectly to a prevailing party\u2019s attorney and thus protects\nthe fees from a Government offset against the prevailing\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

See Brief for Respondent 11\u221219\n(arguing that subsection (d)(1)(A)\u2019s use of the word\n\u201c \u2018award\u2019 \u201d \u201cexpressly incorporates a critical distinction\u201d\nbetween the right to an \u201c \u2018award\u2019 \u201d of fees and the right to\n\u201c \u2018receiv[e]\u2019 \u201d the fees). We disagree.\n    The transitive verb \u201c \u2018award\u2019 \u201d has a settled meaning in\nthe litigation context: It means \u201c[t]o give or assign by\nsentence or judicial determination.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Diction\nary 125 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis added); see also Web\nster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 152 (1993) (\u201cto\ngive by judicial decree\u201d (emphasis added)). The plain\nmeaning of the word \u201caward\u201d in subsection (d)(1)(A) is\nthus that the court shall \u201cgive or assign by . . . judicial\ndetermination\u201d to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d (here, Ratliff\u2019s\nclient Ree) attorney\u2019s fees in the amount sought and sub\nstantiated under, inter alia, subsection (d)(1)(B).\n    Ratliff\u2019s contrary argument does not withstand scrutiny.\nAccording to Ratliff, subsection (d)(1)(B), which uses \u201cthe\nnoun \u2018award\u2019 \u201d to mean a \u201c \u2018decision,\u2019 \u201d requires us to con\nstrue subsection (d)(1)(A) (which uses \u201caward\u201d as a verb)\nto mean that \u201c[o]nly the prevailing party may receive the\naward (the decision granting fees), but only the attorney\nwho earned the fee (the payment asked or given for profes\nsional services) is entitled to receive it.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 16, 15 (emphasis in original; some internal quotation\nmarks and footnote omitted). This argument ignores the\nsettled definitions above, and even the definitions Ratliff\nproffers, because each makes clear that the verb \u201caward\u201d\nin subsection (d)(1)(A) means to \u201cgive by the decision of a\nlaw court\u201d or to \u201cgrant . . . by judicial decree,\u201d not simply to\n\u201cgive a decision\u201d itself. Id., at 16, and n. 39 (emphasis\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted). We thus agree\nwith the Government that under the statutory language\nhere, the \u201cjudicial decision is the means by which the court\nconfers a right to payment upon the prevailing party; it is\nnot itself the thing that the court gives (or orders the\n6                    ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefendant to give) to the party.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner\n4 (emphasis in original) (citing Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S.\n755, 761 (1987) (explaining that \u201c[i]n all civil litigation,\nthe judicial decree is not the end but the means\u201d)). This\nsettled and natural construction of the operative statutory\nlanguage is reflected in our cases. See, e.g., Scarborough\nv. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 405 (2004) (\u201cEAJA authorizes\nthe payment of fees to a prevailing party\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Ratliff\u2019s final textual argument\u2014that subsection\n(d)(1)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d itself establishes\nthat the fees are payable to the prevailing party\u2019s attor\nney, see Brief for Respondent 19\u221222\u2014proves far too much.\nThe fact that the statute awards to the prevailing party\nfees in which her attorney may have a beneficial interest\nor a contractual right does not establish that the statute\n\u201cawards\u201d the fees directly to the attorney. For the reasons\nwe have explained, the statute\u2019s plain text does the oppo\nsite\u2014it \u201cawards\u201d the fees to the litigant, and thus subjects\nthem to a federal administrative offset if the litigant has\noutstanding federal debts.\n                            III\n  In an effort to avoid the Act\u2019s plain meaning, Ratliff\nargues that other provisions of EAJA, combined with the\nSSA and the Government\u2019s practice of paying some EAJA\nfees awards directly to attorneys in Social Security cases,\nrender \u00a72412(d) at least ambiguous on the question pre\nsented here, and that these other provisions resolve the\nambiguity in her favor. Again we disagree. Even accept\ning \u00a72412(d) as ambiguous on the question presented, the\nprovisions and practices Ratliff identifies do not alter our\nconclusion that EAJA fees are payable to litigants and are\nthus subject to offset where a litigant has outstanding\nfederal debts.\n  To begin with, \u00a72412(d)(1)\u2019s provisions differentiate\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween attorneys and prevailing parties, and treat attor\nneys on par with other service providers, in a manner that\nforecloses the conclusion that attorneys have a right to\ndirect payment of subsection (d)(1)(A) awards. As noted\nabove, subsection (d)(1)(B) requires the prevailing party to\nsubmit a fee application showing that she is otherwise\n\u201celigible to receive an award\u201d and, as a complement to that\nrequirement, compels the prevailing party to submit \u201can\nitemized statement from any attorney . . . representing or\nappearing in behalf of the party\u201d that details the attorney\u2019s\nhourly rate and time the attorney spent on the case.\n(Emphasis added.) This language would make little sense\nif, as Ratliff contends, \u00a72412(d)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d lan\nguage effectively refers to the prevailing litigant\u2019s attor\nney. Subsection (d)(1)(B) similarly makes clear that the\n\u201cprevailing party\u201d (not her attorney) is the recipient of the\nfees award by requiring the prevailing party to demon\nstrate that her net worth falls within the range the statute\nrequires for fees awards. And EAJA\u2019s cost provision fur\nther underscores the point. That provision uses language\nidentical to that in the attorney\u2019s fees provision to allow\nprevailing parties to recover \u201cthe reasonable expenses of\nexpert witnesses\u201d and \u201cany study, analysis, engineering\nreport, test, or project\u201d necessary to prepare \u201cthe party\u2019s\ncase,\u201d \u00a72412(d)(2)(A), yet Ratliff does not argue that it\nmakes costs payable directly to the vendors who provide\nthe relevant services.\n   Nor do the SSA provisions on which Ratliff relies estab\nlish that subsection (d)(1)(A) fees awards are payable to\nprevailing parties\u2019 attorneys. It is true that the SSA\nmakes fees awards under that statute payable directly to a\nprevailing claimant\u2019s attorney.           See 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7406(b)(1)(A) (providing that where a claimant \u201cwho was\nrepresented before the court by an attorney\u201d obtains a\nfavorable judgment, \u201cthe court may determine and allow\nas part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such represen\n8                   ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntation, not in excess of 25 percent of\u201d the benefits award\nand may certify the full amount of the statutory fees\naward \u201cfor payment to such attorney out of, and not in\naddition to, the amount of\u201d the claimant\u2019s benefits award\n(emphasis added)). But the SSA\u2019s express authorization of\nsuch payments undermines Ratliff\u2019s case insofar as it\nshows that Congress knows how to make fees awards\npayable directly to attorneys where it desires to do so.\nGiven the stark contrast between the SSA\u2019s express au\nthorization of direct payments to attorneys and the ab\nsence of such language in subsection (d)(1)(A), we are\nreluctant to interpret the latter provision to contain a\ndirect fee requirement absent clear textual evidence sup\nporting such an interpretation.\n   Ratliff contends that Congress\u2019 1985 amendments to\n\u00a7206(b) of EAJA supply just such evidence, at least in\nSocial Security cases. See \u00a73(2), 99 Stat. 186, note follow\ning 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412. The 1985 amendments address the\nfact that Social Security claimants may be eligible to\nreceive fees awards under both the SSA and EAJA, and\nclarify the procedure that attorneys and their clients must\nfollow to prevent the windfall of an unauthorized double\nrecovery of fees for the same work. Section 206(b) pro\nvides that no violation of law occurs \u201cif, where the claim\nant\u2019s attorney receives fees for the same work under both\n[42 U. S. C. \u00a7406(b) and 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)], the claim\nant\u2019s attorney refunds to the claimant the amount of the\nsmaller fee.\u201d According to Ratliff, the fact that \u00a7206(b)\nrecognizes, or at least assumes, that an attorney will\nsometimes \u201creceiv[e]\u201d fees under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)\nsuggests that we should construe subsection (d)(1)(A) to\nincorporate the same direct payments to attorneys that\nthe SSA expressly authorizes.\n   This argument gives more weight to \u00a7206(b)\u2019s reference\nto attorney \u201crecei[pt]\u201d of fees than the reference can bear.\nSection 206(b)\u2019s ensuing reference to the attorney\u2019s obliga\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ntion to \u201crefun[d]\u201d the amount of the smaller fee to the\nclaimant, which reference suggests that the award belongs\nto the claimant in the first place, alone undercuts Ratliff\u2019s\nreading of \u201creceives\u201d as implying an initial statutory pay\nment to the attorney.4 And Ratliff\u2019s reading is in any\nevent irreconcilable with the textual differences between\nEAJA and the SSA we discuss above. Thus, even accept\ning Ratliff\u2019s argument that subsection (d)(1)(A) is ambigu\nous, the statutory provisions she cites resolve any ambigu\nity in favor of treating subsection (d)(1)(A) awards as\npayable to the prevailing litigant, and thus subject to\noffset where the litigant has relevant federal debts.\n   The Government\u2019s history of paying EAJA awards di\nrectly to attorneys in certain cases does not compel a\ndifferent conclusion. The Government concedes that until\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Ratliffargues that fees awarded under 42 U. S. C. \u00a7406(b) can never\nbe \u201c \u2018refund[ed]\u2019 \u201d in this sense because SSA fees are \u201cnever paid initially\nto the client.\u201d Brief for Respondent 14 (emphasis in original). That is\nnot accurate. As we have explained, Social Security claimants and\nattorneys normally enter into contingent-fee agreements that are\nsubject to judicial \u201creview for reasonableness.\u201d Gisbrecht v. Barnhart,\n535 U. S. 789, 809 (2002). Where the court allows a fee, \u00a7406(b) per\nmits the Commissioner to collect the approved fee out of the client\u2019s\nbenefit award and to certify the fee for \u201cpayment to such attorney out\nof\u201d that award. \u00a7406(b)(1)(A). In such cases, the attorney would\n\u201crefun[d]\u201d the fee to the client in the event that the attorney also\nreceives a (larger) EAJA award, because the attorney \u201creceive[d]\u201d the\nSSA fee from the client\u2019s funds. Similarly inaccurate is Ratliff\u2019s sugges\ntion that our construction of EAJA \u00a7206(b)\u2019s reference to \u201crefun[d]\u201d\nwould preclude attorneys from collecting any fees from a prevailing\nparty until both SSA and EAJA payments are awarded. Our construc\ntion does not alter or preclude what we have recognized as courts\u2019\ncommon practice of awarding EAJA fees at the time a court remands a\ncase to the Social Security Administration (Administration) for benefits\nproceedings. Such awards often allow attorneys to collect EAJA fees\nmonths before any fees are awarded under 42 U. S.C \u00a7406(b), because\n\u00a7406(b) fees cannot be determined until the Administration enters a\nfinal benefits ruling. See Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U. S. 292, 295\u2212302\n(1993).\n10                        ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n2006, it \u201cfrequently paid EAJA fees in Social Security\ncases directly to attorneys.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 13.\nBut this fact does not alter our interpretation of subsec\ntion (d)(1)(A)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d language or the Govern\nment\u2019s rights and obligations under the statute. As the\nGovernment explains, it most often paid EAJA fees di\nrectly to attorneys in cases in which the prevailing party\nhad assigned its rights in the fees award to the attorney\n(which assignment would not be necessary if the statute\nrendered the fees award payable to the attorney in the\nfirst instance). The fact that some such cases involved a\nprevailing party with outstanding federal debts is unsur\nprising given that it was not until 2005 that the Treasury\nDepartment modified the TOP to require offsets against\n\u201cmiscellaneous\u201d payments such as attorney\u2019s fees awards.\nAnd as Ratliff admits, the Government has since contin\nued the direct payment practice only in cases where \u201cthe\nplaintiff does not owe a debt to the government and as\nsigns the right to receive the fees to the attorney.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 28 (boldface deleted). The Government\u2019s\ndecision to continue direct payments only in such cases is\neasily explained by the 2005 amendments to the TOP, and\nnothing about the Government\u2019s past payment practices\naltered the statutory text that governs this case or es\ntopped the Government from conforming its payment\npractices to the Treasury Department\u2019s revised regula\ntions. For all of these reasons, neither EAJA nor the SSA\nsupports Ratliff\u2019s reading of subsection (d)(1)(A).\n   Our cases interpreting and applying 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988,\nwhich contains language virtually identical to the EAJA\nprovision we address here,5 buttress this conclusion. Our\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Section 1988(b) provides that in actions covered by the statute and\nsubject to exceptions not relevant here, \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable\nattorney\u2019s fee.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmost recent cases applying \u00a71988(b)\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d\nlanguage recognize the practical reality that attorneys are\nthe beneficiaries and, almost always, the ultimate recipi\nents of the fees that the statute awards to \u201cprevailing\npart[ies].\u201d See, e.g., Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U. S. 82, 86\n(1990). But these cases emphasize the nonstatutory (con\ntractual and other assignment-based) rights that typically\nconfer upon the attorney the entitlement to payment of\nthe fees award the statute confers on the prevailing liti\ngant. As noted above, these kinds of arrangements would\nbe unnecessary if, as Ratliff contends, statutory fees lan\nguage like that in \u00a71988(b) and EAJA provides attorneys\nwith a statutory right to direct payment of awards. Hence\nour conclusion that \u201cthe party, rather than the lawyer,\u201d\nid., at 87, is \u201centitle[d] to receive the fees\u201d under \u00a71988(b),\nid., at 88, and that the statute \u201ccontrols what the losing\ndefendant must pay, not what the prevailing plaintiff\nmust pay his lawyer,\u201d id., at 90; see also Evans v.

S. C. \u00a72412(d) is payable to the prevailing litigant\nrather than the attorney. The EAJA does not legally\nobligate the Government to pay a prevailing litigant\u2019s\nattorney, and the litigant\u2019s obligation to pay her attorney\nis controlled not by the EAJA but by contract and the law\ngoverning that contract. That conclusion, however, does\nnot answer the question whether Congress intended the\nGovernment to deduct moneys from EAJA fee awards to\noffset a litigant\u2019s pre-existing and unrelated debt, as the\nTreasury Department began to do only in 2005 pursuant\nto its authority under the Debt Collection Improvement\nAct of 1996 (DCIA). In my view, it is likely both that\nCongress did not consider that question and that, had it\ndone so, it would not have wanted EAJA fee awards to be\nsubject to offset. Because such offsets undercut the effec\ntiveness of the EAJA and cannot be justified by reference\nto the DCIA\u2019s text or purpose, it seems probable that\nCongress would have made, and perhaps will in the future\nmake, the opposite choice if clearly presented with it.\n   In enacting the EAJA, Congress found \u201cthat certain\n2                       ASTRUE v.

As we\nhave often recognized, \u201cthe specific purpose of the EAJA is\nto eliminate for the average person the financial disincen\ntive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.\u201d\nCommissioner v. Jean, 496 U. S. 154, 163 (1990); see also\nScarborough v. Principi, 541 U.

Rep. No. 96\u2013253, p. 5 (1979))). EAJA fee awards, which\naverage only $3,000 to $4,000 per case, have proved to be\na remarkably efficient way of improving access to the\ncourts for the statute\u2019s intended beneficiaries, including\nthousands of recipients of Social Security and veteran\u2019s\nbenefits each year.1 Brief for Respondent 4\u20135; see also\nJean, 496 U. S., at 164, nn. 12\u201313.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The EAJA makes fee awards available to challenge Government\n\naction under a wide range of statutes, but, as respondent notes, the\nvast majority of EAJA awards are made in these two contexts, with\nSocial Security cases representing the lion\u2019s share. Brief for Respon\ndent 4\u20135; Brief for National Organization of Social Security Claimants\u2019\nRepresentatives et al. as Amici Curiae 22\u201323.\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   3\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n   The EAJA\u2019s admirable purpose will be undercut if law\nyers fear that they will never actually receive attorney\u2019s\nfees to which a court has determined the prevailing party\nis entitled. The point of an award of attorney\u2019s fees, after\nall, is to enable a prevailing litigant to pay her attorney.\nSee, e.g., Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U. S. 274, 285 (1989)\n(\u201cWe . . . take as our starting point the self-evident propo\nsition that the \u2018reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u2019 provided by [42\nU. S. C. \u00a71988] should compensate\u201d for \u201cthe work product\nof an attorney\u201d); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 435\n(1983) (\u201cWhere a plaintiff has obtained excellent results,\nhis attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee\u201d). We\nhave accordingly acknowledged that in litigants\u2019 motions\nfor attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cthe real parties in interest are their\nattorneys.\u201d Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U. S. 789, 798, n. 6\n(2002). Subjecting EAJA fee awards to administrative\noffset for a litigant\u2019s debts will unquestionably make it\nmore difficult for persons of limited means to find attor\nneys to represent them. See, e.g., Brief for National Or\nganization of Social Security Claimants\u2019 Representatives\net al. as Amici Curiae 25 (hereinafter NOSSCR Brief).\n   In its arguments before this Court, the Government\nresists this self-evident conclusion, but each of the three\nreasons it proffers is unpersuasive. First, the Government\nsuggests that because EAJA fee awards are limited to\nthose circumstances in which the Government\u2019s position is\nnot \u201csubstantially justified,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72412(d)(1)(A), no\nlawyer can rely on an EAJA fee award when deciding to\ntake a case, so the possibility of an offset eliminating the\naward will play no additional role in the lawyer\u2019s deci\nsion.2 Reply Brief for Petitioner 16\u201317. But it is common\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In its brief, the Government downplays the frequency with which fee\n\nawards under the EAJA are made. At oral argument, respondent\u2019s\ncounsel represented that EAJA fee awards are made in 42% of Social\nSecurity cases in which the claimant prevails and in 70% of all vet\neran\u2019s benefits cases filed. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\u201343. The Government did\n4                       ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nsense that increasing the risk that an attorney will not\nreceive a fee award will inevitably decrease the willing\nness of attorneys to undertake representation in these\nkinds of cases.\n  Second, the Government contends that any disincentive\nthe fear of administrative offset may create is mitigated in\nthe Social Security context by the Social Security Act\u2019s\nindependent provision authorizing a fee award payable\ndirectly to the attorney. See id., at 17\u201318 (citing 42\nU. S. C. \u00a7406(b)(1)(A)). But as the Government acknowl\nedges, the \u201cEAJA\u2019s fee-shifting provisions are potentially\nmore generous than [the Social Security Act\u2019s] in at least\nthree respects\u201d: (1) A court may not award attorney\u2019s fees\nunder the Social Security Act, but may under the EAJA,\nwhen the claimant wins only a procedural victory and does\nnot obtain any past-due benefits; (2) fees under the Social\nSecurity Act are limited to a percentage of benefits\nawarded, while EAJA fees are calculated under the lode\nstar method by examining the attorney\u2019s reasonable hours\nexpended and her reasonable hourly rate; and (3) in con\ntrast to the Social Security Act, fees may be awarded\nunder the EAJA in addition to, rather than out of, the\nbenefits awarded. Brief for Petitioner 6\u20137. EAJA awards\nthus provide an important additional incentive for attor\nneys to undertake Social Security cases.\n  Finally, the Government argues that lawyers can easily\ndetermine at the outset whether a potential client owes\nthe Government a debt and can then assist the client in\nestablishing a written repayment plan that would prevent\nan offset. Reply Brief for Petitioner 18. At oral argument,\nhowever, the Government acknowledged that it was not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnot contest the number for Social Security cases but suggested that the\npercentage of veteran\u2019s benefits cases resulting in EAJA awards is\ncloser to 50% or 60%. Id., at 52. Under either estimate, these are\nhardly vanishing odds of success for an attorney deciding whether to\ntake a client\u2019s case.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\naware of any instance in which this has happened in the\nfive years since it began subjecting EAJA fee awards to\nadministrative offset. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313. It is not\ndifficult to understand why. Helping a client establish a\nrepayment plan would be a time-consuming endeavor\nuncompensated by any fee-shifting provision, and a client\nwho needs such assistance is unlikely to have the funds to\npay the attorney for that service. If the Government is\ninstead suggesting that a lawyer can simply decline to\nrepresent a prospective client once she knows of the cli\nent\u2019s debtor status, that suggestion only proves my point.\nCf. NOSSCR Brief 25 (describing deterrent effect of offsets\non representation).\n   In the end, the Government has no compelling response\nto the fact that today\u2019s decision will make it more difficult\nfor the neediest litigants to find attorneys to represent\nthem in cases against the Government. I \u201cfind it difficult\nto ascribe to Congress an intent to throw\u201d an EAJA liti\ngant \u201ca lifeline that it knew was a foot short. . . . Given the\nanomalous nature of this result, and its frustration of the\nvery purposes behind the EAJA itself, Congress cannot\nlightly be assumed to have intended it.\u201d Sullivan, 490\nU. S., at 890.\n   The Government suggests that it is possible to glean\nsuch intent from the fact that Congress did not expressly\nexempt EAJA awards from administrative offset under the\nDCIA. Reply Brief for Petitioner 19\u201320; 31 U. S. C.\n\u00a73716(c)(1)(C) (specifying certain federal payments that\nare not subject to administrative offset); see also 31 CFR\n\u00a7285.5(e)(2) (2009) (identifying payments that are not\nsubject to administrative offset because of a statutory\nexemption). If \u201capplication of the offset program to such\nawards will make it more difficult for Social Security\nclaimants or other litigants to find attorneys,\u201d the Gov\nernment contends, the \u201cprovisions that govern the offset\nprogram indicate that Congress is willing to bear that\n6                    ASTRUE v. RATLIFF\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\ncost.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 20. The history of these\nprovisions indicates otherwise. For more than two dec\nades after the EAJA was enacted in 1980, the Commis\nsioner of Social Security \u201cconsistently paid\u201d EAJA fee\nawards directly to the attorney, not the prevailing party.\nStephens ex rel. R. E. v. Astrue, 565 F. 3d 131, 135 (CA4\n2009); see also Bryant v. Commissioner of Social Security,\n578 F. 3d 443, 446 (CA6 2009); cf. ante, at 3, n. 3, 9\u201310.\n\u201cIn fact, the Commissioner created a direct deposit system\nfor attorneys and issued [Internal Revenue Service] 1099\nforms directly to the attorneys who received awards, not\ning the awards as taxable attorney income.\u201d Stephens, 565\nF. 3d, at 135. Not until 2005, when the Treasury Depart\nment extended the offset program to cover \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d\nfederal payments, including \u201cfees,\u201d did the Commissioner\ncease paying EAJA fee awards directly to attorneys and\nadopt the position that the awards were appropriately\nconsidered the property of the prevailing party. Id., at 136\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bryant, 578\nF. 3d, at 446; ante, at 2, 10. Congress therefore had no\nreason to include a specific exemption of EAJA fee awards\n(in the Social Security context or otherwise) from the offset\nprogram when it enacted the DCIA in 1996.\n   I am further reluctant to conclude that Congress would\nwant EAJA fee awards to be offset for a prevailing liti\ngant\u2019s unrelated debts because it is not likely to effectuate\nthe DCIA\u2019s purpose of \u201cmaximiz[ing] collections of delin\nquent debts owed to the Government by ensuring quick\naction to enforce recovery of debts and the use of all ap\npropriate collection tools.\u201d \u00a731001(b)(1), 110 Stat. 1321\u2013\n358. This purpose would be better served if claimants are\nable to find attorneys to help them secure the benefits\nthey are rightfully owed in the first place, thereby making\navailable a source of funds to permit repayment of the\nclaimants\u2019 Government debts at all. See NOSSCR Brief\n32; see also 31 U. S. C. \u00a73716(c)(3)(A) (after initial $9,000\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The Legislature has just cause\nto clarify beyond debate\u201d whether this effect is one it\nactually intends. Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.
