Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n                     DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 09\u20136338. Argued March 30, 2010\u2014Decided June 17, 2010\nIn 1993, petitioner Dillon was convicted of, inter alia, crack and powder\n  cocaine offenses, which produced a base offense level of 38 and a\n  Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court\n  sentenced him at the bottom of the range for those counts. After the\n  Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the base\n  offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine, USSG\n  Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706, and made that amendment retroactive,\n  USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 713, Dillon moved for a sentence reduc\n  tion under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2). That provision authorizes a\n  district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence pursuant to a\n  Guidelines amendment if a reduction is consistent with the Commis\n  sion\u2019s policy statements. The relevant policy statement, USSG\n  \u00a71B1.10, precludes a court from reducing a sentence \u201cto a term that is\n  less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range\u201d except in\n  limited circumstances. In addition to the two-level reduction author\n  ized by the amendment, Dillon sought a variance below the amended\n  Guidelines range, contending that United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.\n  220, authorized the exercise of such discretion. The District Court\n  imposed a sentence at the bottom of the revised range but declined to\n  grant a further reduction. Finding Booker inapplicable to \u00a73582(c)(2)\n  proceedings, the court concluded that the Commission\u2019s directives in\n  \u00a71B1.10 constrained it to impose a sentence within the amended\n  Guidelines range. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Booker\u2019s holdings do not apply to \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings and\n therefore do not require treating \u00a71B1.10(b) as advisory. Pp. 6\u201314.\n    (a) The statute\u2019s text and narrow scope belie Dillon\u2019s characteriza\n tion of proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2) as \u201cresentencing\u201d proceedings\n governed by the same principles as other sentencing proceedings. In\n2                      DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    stead, \u00a73582(c)(2) authorizes only a limited adjustment to an other\n    wise final sentence. This conclusion is further supported by the sub\n    stantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence\n    modification proceedings, charging it with determining whether and\n    to what extent a Guidelines amendment will be retroactive, 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a7994(u), and authorizing a court to grant a reduction under\n    \u00a73582(c)(2) only \u201cif [it] is consistent with applicable policy statements\n    issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Section 3582(c)(2) estab\n    lishes a two-step inquiry: A court must (1) determine the scope of the\n    reduction, if any, authorized by \u00a71B1.10, and then (2) consider\n    whether the authorized reduction is warranted according to the ap\n    plicable \u00a73553(a) factors. At step one, the court must follow the\n    Commission\u2019s instructions in \u00a71B1.10 to impose a term of imprison\n    ment within the amended Guidelines range unless the sentencing\n    court originally imposed a below-Guidelines sentence. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2).\n    Because reference to \u00a73553(a) is appropriate only at step two, that\n    provision does not transform \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings into plenary re\n    sentencing proceedings. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Given \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s limited scope and purpose, proceedings un\n    der that section do not implicate Booker. The section represents a\n    congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of\n    later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guide\n    lines. Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a\n    judge at a \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the pre\n    scribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judge\u2019s ex\n    ercise of discretion within that range. That exercise does not contra\n    vene the Sixth Amendment, even if it is informed by judge-found\n    facts. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481. Thus, Dillon\u2019s\n    Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District Court\u2019s\n    adherence to \u00a71B1.10\u2019s instruction to consider a reduction only within\n    the amended Guidelines range. Dillon\u2019s argument that Booker\u2019s re\n    medial opinion nonetheless requires the Guidelines to be treated as\n    advisory in such proceedings is unpersuasive given that proceedings\n    under \u00a73582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other sentencing\n    proceedings. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (c) Also rejected is Dillon\u2019s argument that the District Court should\n    have corrected other mistakes in his original sentence, namely, a\n    Booker error resulting from the initial sentencing court\u2019s treatment of\n    the Guidelines as mandatory and an alleged error in the calculation\n    of his criminal-history category. Because those aspects of Dillon\u2019s\n    sentence were not affected by the crack-cocaine Guidelines amend\n    ment, they are outside the scope of the \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding, and\n    the District Court properly declined to address them.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 17, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A federal court generally \u201cmay not modify a term of\nimprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73582(c). Congress has provided an exception to that rule\n\u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that\nhas subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Com\nmission.\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2). In those circumstances, \u00a73582(c)(2)\nauthorizes a court to reduce the term of imprisonment \u201cif\nsuch a reduction is consistent with\u201d applicable Commis\nsion policy statements. The policy statement governing\n\u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings instructs courts not to reduce a\nterm of imprisonment below the minimum of an amended\nsentencing range except to the extent the original term of\nimprisonment was below the range then applicable. See\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(2) (Nov. 2009) (USSG). This case presents the\nquestion whether our decision in United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220 (2005), which rendered the Guidelines advi\nsory to remedy the Sixth Amendment problems associated\nwith a mandatory sentencing regime, requires treating\n\u00a71B1.10(b) as nonbinding. We conclude that Booker does\n2                DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot demand that result.\n                              I\n   The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA or Act), 98\nStat. 1987, established the Sentencing Commission and\nauthorized it to promulgate Sentencing Guidelines and to\nissue policy statements regarding the Guidelines\u2019 applica\ntion. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991, 994(a). The Act also charged\nthe Commission with periodically reviewing and revising\nthe Guidelines. See \u00a7994(o). When a revision reduces the\nGuidelines range for a given offense, the Commission must\ndetermine \u201cin what circumstances and by what amount\nthe sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment\nfor the offense may be reduced.\u201d \u00a7994(u).\n   As enacted, the SRA made the Sentencing Guidelines\nbinding. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 233\u2013234. Except in\nlimited circumstances, district courts lacked discretion to\ndepart from the Guidelines range. See Burns v. United\nStates, 501 U. S. 129, 133 (1991). Under that regime, facts\nfound by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence often\nincreased the mandatory Guidelines range and permitted\nthe judge to impose a sentence greater than that sup\nported by the facts established by the jury verdict or guilty\nplea. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 235. We held in Booker\nthat treating the Guidelines as mandatory in these cir\ncumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of crimi\nnal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every\nelement of an offense proved by the Government beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Id., at 243\u2013244.\n   To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the\nGuidelines advisory by invalidating two provisions of the\nSRA: 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which\ngenerally required a sentencing court to impose a sentence\nwithin the applicable Guidelines range, and \u00a73742(e)\n(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of\nreview on appeal, including de novo review of Guidelines\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndepartures. 543 U. S., at 259. \u201cWith these two sections\nexcised (and statutory cross-references to the two sections\nconsequently invalidated),\u201d we held that \u201cthe remainder of\nthe Act satisfies the Court\u2019s constitutional requirements.\u201d\nIbid. Booker thus left intact other provisions of the SRA,\nincluding those giving the Commission authority to revise\nthe Guidelines, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(o) (2006 ed.), and to de\ntermine when and to what extent a revision will be retro\nactive, \u00a7994(u).\n   With respect to drug-trafficking offenses, the Sentencing\nGuidelines establish a defendant\u2019s base offense level ac\ncording to the type and weight of the drug. See USSG\n\u00a7\u00a72D1.1(a), (c). When the Commission first promulgated\nthe Guidelines in 1987, it adopted the 100-to-1 ratio se\nlected by Congress in setting mandatory minimum sen\ntences in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207.\nUnder that framework, the Commission \u201ctreated every\ngram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of\npowder cocaine.\u201d Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.\n85, 96 (2007). The Commission later sought to alleviate\nthe disparity produced by this ratio. After several failed\nattempts at reform, see id., at 99, the Commission in 2007\namended the Guidelines to reduce by two levels the base\noffense level associated with each quantity of crack co\ncaine. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (effective Nov.\n1, 2007). In 2008, the Commission made that amendment\nretroactive. See id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).\n   When the Commission makes a Guidelines amendment\nretroactive, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2) authorizes a district\ncourt to reduce an otherwise final sentence that is based\non the amended provision. Any reduction must be consis\ntent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sen\ntencing Commission.       The relevant policy statement,\nUSSG \u00a71B1.10, instructs courts proceeding under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) to substitute the amended Guidelines range\nwhile \u201cleav[ing] all other guideline application decisions\n4                    DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nunaffected.\u201d \u00a71B1.10(b)(1).1 Under \u00a73582(c)(2), a court\nmay then grant a reduction within the amended Guide\nlines range if it determines that one is warranted \u201cafter\nconsidering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the\nextent that they are applicable.\u201d2 Except in limited cir\ncumstances, however, \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A) forecloses a court\nacting under \u00a73582(c)(2) from reducing a sentence \u201cto a\nterm that is less than the minimum of the amended guide\nline range.\u201d\n                              II\n  A jury convicted petitioner Percy Dillon in 1993 of con\nspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to\ndistribute more than 500 grams of powder cocaine and\nmore than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7846, possession with the intent to distribute\nmore than 500 grams of powder cocaine in violation of\n\u00a7841(a)(1), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a\ndrug-trafficking offense in violation of 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c)(1). Dillon\u2019s convictions exposed him to a statutory\nsentencing range of 10 years to life for the conspiracy, 5\nto-40 years for cocaine possession, and a mandatory mini\nmum sentence of 5 years for the firearm offense, to be\nserved consecutively to the sentence for the drug offenses.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Sentencing Commission substantially revised \u00a71B1.10 in March\n\n2008, see USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 712 (Nov. 2009) (effective Mar. 3,\n2008), roughly three months before the District Court\u2019s decision in this\ncase. Because the current version of the relevant Guidelines provisions\nis not meaningfully different from the version in effect at the time of\nthe District Court\u2019s decision, references in this opinion are to the\ncurrent, 2009 edition of the Guidelines.\n   2 Section 3553(a) provides that a \u201ccourt shall impose a sentence suffi\n\ncient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set\nforth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d and it enumerates several\nfactors a court \u201cshall consider\u201d in determining an appropriate sentence,\nincluding \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history\nand characteristics of the defendant,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(1).\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   At sentencing, the District Court made additional find\nings of fact and concluded that Dillon was responsible for\n1.5 kilograms of crack and 1.6 kilograms of powder co\ncaine. Under USSG \u00a72D1.1, those drug quantities pro\nduced a base offense level of 38. After offsetting adjust\nments for acceptance of responsibility, \u00a73E1.1, and\nreckless endangerment during flight, \u00a73C1.2, Dillon\u2019s total\noffense level remained 38. Coupled with a criminal\nhistory category of II,3 that offense level produced a then\nmandatory Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months\u2019 im\nprisonment for the drug counts.\n   The court sentenced Dillon at the bottom of the Guide\nlines range for those counts, followed by a mandatory 60\nmonth sentence for the firearm count, for a total sentence\nof 322 months\u2019 imprisonment. At Dillon\u2019s sentencing, the\ncourt described the term of imprisonment as \u201centirely too\nhigh for the crime [Dillon] committed.\u201d App. 13. Perceiv\ning no basis for departing from the then-mandatory Sen\ntencing Guidelines, the District Court felt constrained to\nimpose a sentence within the prescribed range. The Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed Dillon\u2019s convic\ntions and sentence on appeal. See 100 F. 3d 949 (1996).\n   After the Sentencing Commission made the amendment\nto the crack-cocaine Guidelines retroactive in 2008, Dillon\nfiled a pro se motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to\n\u00a73582(c)(2). In the motion, Dillon asked the court to grant\nnot just the two-level reduction authorized by the amend\nment but also a further reduction consistent with the\nsentencing factors found in \u00a73553(a). Based largely on his\npostsentencing conduct, including his determined pursuit\nof educational and community-outreach opportunities,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Probation Office based Dillon\u2019s criminal-history assessment on\ntwo prior misdemeanor convictions, one for possession of marijuana and\none for resisting arrest. Dillon did not object to that calculation of his\ncriminal-history score.\n6                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nDillon contended that a variance from the amended Guide\nlines range was warranted in his case. He further urged\nthat, after Booker, the court was authorized to grant such\na variance because the amended Guidelines range was\nadvisory notwithstanding any contrary statement in\n\u00a71B1.10.\n   The District Court reduced Dillon\u2019s sentence to 270\nmonths\u2014the term at the bottom of the revised Guidelines\nrange.4 But the court declined to go further. Concluding\nthat the sentencing proceedings at issue in Booker are\nreadily distinguishable from those under \u00a73582(c)(2), the\ncourt found Booker\u2019s holdings inapplicable to the instant\nproceeding and accordingly held that it lacked authority to\nimpose a sentence inconsistent with \u00a71B1.10.\n   The Third Circuit affirmed. 572 F. 3d 146, 150 (2009).\nThe court noted that \u00a73582(c)(2) is codified in a different\nsection than the provisions invalidated in Booker and\ncontains no cross-reference to those provisions. Finding\nno other indication that Booker \u201cobviate[d] the congres\nsional directive in \u00a73582(c)(2) that a sentence reduction\npursuant to that section be consistent with Sentencing\nCommission policy statements,\u201d 572 F. 3d, at 149, the\nThird Circuit held that \u00a71B1.10 is binding. It therefore\nagreed that the District Court lacked authority to reduce\nDillon\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range.\n   We granted certiorari to consider Booker\u2019s applicability\nto \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  \u201c[A] judgment of conviction that includes [a sentence of\nimprisonment] constitutes a final judgment\u201d and may not\nbe modified by a district court except in limited circum\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The revised sentence reflects a 210-month term of imprisonment for\n\nthe narcotics offenses and a mandatory, consecutive 60-month term for\nthe firearm offense.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Section 3582(c)(2) establishes an ex\nception to the general rule of finality \u201cin the case of a\ndefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprison\nment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently\nbeen lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(o)\u201d and made retroactive pursuant to\n\u00a7994(u). In such cases, Congress has authorized courts to\n\u201creduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the\nfactors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they\nare applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with appli\ncable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commis\nsion.\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2).\n   Characterizing proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2) as \u201cresen\ntencing\u201d proceedings, Dillon contends that \u201c[t]here is no\npractical or functional difference between a resentencing\npursuant to \u00a73582(c)(2) and any other resentencing.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 18. Accordingly, Dillon urges, the same\nprinciples that govern other sentencing proceedings like\nwise govern \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings, and courts have\nauthority under \u00a73582(c)(2) to vary from the revised\nGuidelines range consistent with \u00a73553(a), see\nKimbrough, 552 U. S., at 101. Dillon cites as support for\nthis view \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s instruction to consider the factors\nin \u00a73553(a) in determining whether a sentence reduction\nis warranted. Under Dillon\u2019s approach, Booker would\npreclude the Commission from issuing a policy statement\nthat generally forecloses below-Guidelines sentences at\n\u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings, as USSG \u00a71B1.10 purports to do.\nDillon thus asks us to excise the mandatory language of\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A) and treat that provision as advisory, just\nas we did the offending statutory provisions in Booker.\n   The language of \u00a73582(c)(2) belies Dillon\u2019s characteriza\ntion of proceedings under that section. By its terms,\n\u00a73582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentenc\ning proceeding. Instead, it provides for the \u201cmodif[ication\nof] a term of imprisonment\u201d by giving courts the power to\n8                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201creduce\u201d an otherwise final sentence in circumstances\nspecified by the Commission.         Compare 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7994(a)(2)(C) (referring to \u00a73582(c)(2) as a \u201csentence modi\nfication provisio[n]\u201d), with 18 U. S. C. \u00a73742(f) (authoriz\ning courts of appeals to remand \u201cfor further sentencing\u201d\nupon a finding of error), and \u00a73742(g) (establishing the\nterms of \u201csentencing upon remand\u201d and describing the\nproceeding as a \u201cresentenc[ing]\u201d (capitalization omitted)).\nIt is also notable that the provision applies only to a lim\nited class of prisoners\u2014namely, those whose sentence was\nbased on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the\nCommission. Section 3582(c)(2)\u2019s text, together with its\nnarrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize\nonly a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence\nand not a plenary resentencing proceeding.\n   The substantial role Congress gave the Commission\nwith respect to sentence-modification proceedings further\nsupports this conclusion. The SRA charges the Commis\nsion both with deciding whether to amend the Guidelines,\n\u00a7994(o), and with determining whether and to what extent\nan amendment will be retroactive, \u00a7994(u).5 A court\u2019s\npower under \u00a73582(c)(2) thus depends in the first instance\non the Commission\u2019s decision not just to amend the Guide\nlines but to make the amendment retroactive. The court is\nalso constrained by the Commission\u2019s statements dictating\n\u201cby what amount\u201d the sentence of a prisoner serving a\nterm of imprisonment affected by the amendment \u201cmay be\nreduced.\u201d \u00a7994(u); see also Braxton v. United States, 500\nU.

Section 3582(c)(2) instructs a dis\ntrict court to \u201cconside[r] the factors set forth in section\n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d but it\nauthorizes a reduction on that basis only \u201cif such a reduc\ntion is consistent with applicable policy statements issued\nby the Sentencing Commission\u201d\u2014namely, \u00a71B1.10. The\nstatute thus establishes a two-step inquiry. A court must\nfirst determine that a reduction is consistent with \u00a71B1.10\nbefore it may consider whether the authorized reduction is\nwarranted, either in whole or in part, according to the\nfactors set forth in \u00a73553(a).\n   Following this two-step approach, a district court pro\nceeding under \u00a73582(c)(2) does not impose a new sentence\nin the usual sense. At step one, \u00a73582(c)(2) requires the\ncourt to follow the Commission\u2019s instructions in \u00a71B1.10 to\ndetermine the prisoner\u2019s eligibility for a sentence modifi\ncation and the extent of the reduction authorized. Specifi\ncally, \u00a71B1.10(b)(1) requires the court to begin by \u201cdeter\nmin[ing] the amended guideline range that would have\nbeen applicable to the defendant\u201d had the relevant\namendment been in effect at the time of the initial sen\ntencing. \u201cIn making such determination, the court shall\nsubstitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for\nthe corresponding guideline provisions that were applied\nwhen the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all\nother guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d Ibid.\n   Consistent with the limited nature of \u00a73582(c)(2) pro\nceedings, \u00a71B1.10(b)(2) also confines the extent of the\nreduction authorized. Courts generally may \u201cnot reduce\nthe defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the minimum of\nthe amended guideline range\u201d produced by the substitu\ntion. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A). Only if the sentencing court origi\nnally imposed a term of imprisonment below the Guide\nlines range does \u00a71B1.10 authorize a court proceeding\n10               DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder \u00a73582(c)(2) to impose a term \u201ccomparably\u201d below the\namended range. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(B).\n  At step two of the inquiry, \u00a73582(c)(2) instructs a court\nto consider any applicable \u00a73553(a) factors and determine\nwhether, in its discretion, the reduction authorized by\nreference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted\nin whole or in part under the particular circumstances of\nthe case. Because reference to \u00a73553(a) is appropriate\nonly at the second step of this circumscribed inquiry, it\ncannot serve to transform the proceedings under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) into plenary resentencing proceedings.\n  This understanding of \u00a73582(c)(2) as a narrow exception\nto the rule of finality finds further support outside the\nstatute. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 requires\nthat a defendant be present at \u201csentencing,\u201d see Rule\n43(a)(3), but it excludes from that requirement proceed\nings that \u201cinvolv[e] the correction or reduction of sentence\nunder Rule 35 or 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c),\u201d Rule 43(b)(4). Like\n\u00a73582(c)(2), Rule 35 delineates a limited set of circum\nstances in which a sentence may be corrected or reduced.\nSpecifically, it authorizes a court to \u201ccorrect a sentence\nthat resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear\nerror\u201d within 14 days after sentencing, Rule 35(a), and it\nauthorizes a reduction for substantial assistance on the\nGovernment\u2019s motion, Rule 35(b). Rule 43 therefore sets\nthe proceedings authorized by \u00a73582(c)(2) and Rule 35\napart from other sentencing proceedings.\n                             B\n  Given the limited scope and purpose of \u00a73582(c)(2), we\nconclude that proceedings under that section do not impli\ncate the interests identified in Booker. Notably, the sen\ntence-modification proceedings authorized by \u00a73582(c)(2)\nare not constitutionally compelled. We are aware of no\nconstitutional requirement of retroactivity that entitles\ndefendants sentenced to a term of imprisonment to the\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Rather,\n\u00a73582(c)(2) represents a congressional act of lenity in\ntended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted ad\njustments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines.\n   Viewed that way, proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2) do not\nimplicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Taking\nthe original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge\nat a \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the\nprescribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only\nthe judge\u2019s exercise of discretion within that range.\n\u201c[J]udges in this country have long exercised discretion of\nthis nature in imposing sentence within [established]\nlimits in the individual case,\u201d and the exercise of such\ndiscretion does not contravene the Sixth Amendment even\nif it is informed by judge-found facts. Apprendi v. New\nJersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481 (2000) (emphasis in original).\nBecause \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings give judges no more than\nthis circumscribed discretion, \u201c[t]here is no encroachment\nhere by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury,\nnor any threat to the jury\u2019s domain as a bulwark at trial\nbetween the State and the accused.\u201d Oregon v. Ice, 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Accordingly, Dillon\u2019s\nSixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District\nCourt\u2019s adherence to the instruction in \u00a71B1.10 to consider\na reduction only within the amended Guidelines range.\n   Dillon contends that, even if \u00a73582(c)(2) does not impli\ncate the constitutional rights vindicated in Booker\u2014\nsomething the dissent appears to concede\u2014the remedial\naspect of the Court\u2019s decision applies to proceedings under\nthat section and requires that the Guidelines be treated as\nadvisory in such proceedings just as they are in other\nsentencing proceedings. In support of his position, Dillon\ninvokes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in United States v.\n12                  DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nHicks, 472 F. 3d 1167, 1170 (2007).6 Relying on our rejec\ntion in Booker of a remedy that would have made the\nGuidelines advisory only in certain cases\u2014namely, when\ntreating them as binding would run afoul of the Sixth\nAmendment, see 543 U. S., at 265\u2013267\u2014the Ninth Circuit\nheld that Booker precludes treating the Guidelines as\nmandatory for purposes of \u00a73582(c)(2) and advisory in\nother contexts, see Hicks, 472 F. 3d, at 1171\u20131172.\n   This argument is unpersuasive. The incomplete remedy\nwe rejected in Booker would have required courts to treat\nthe Guidelines differently in similar proceedings, leading\npotentially to unfair results and considerable administra\ntive challenges. See 543 U. S., at 266. As already ex\nplained, the sentence-modification proceedings authorized\nby \u00a73582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other\nsentencing proceedings. Given the substantially different\npurpose of \u00a73582(c)(2) and the circumscribed nature of\nproceedings under that section, requiring courts to honor\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(2)\u2019s instruction not to depart from the amended\nGuidelines range at such proceedings will create none of\nthe confusion or unfairness that led us in Booker to reject\nthe Government\u2019s argument for a partial fix.\n   The dissent\u2019s contrary conclusion rests on two erroneous\npremises. First, the dissent ignores the fundamental\ndifferences between sentencing and sentence-modification\nproceedings and asserts without explanation that\n\u201c[n]othing turns on\u201d the distinction between them.

Moreover,\nwhile the dissent criticizes our approach for leaving the\nCommission with only the \u201cthe tiniest sliver of lawmaking\npower,\u201d post, at 11, the dissent would leave the Commis\nsion with an even smaller and less explicable sliver by\ndissecting the authority granted by \u00a7994(u).\n  For all of these reasons, we conclude that neither\nBooker\u2019s constitutional nor remedial holding requires the\nresult that Dillon urges.\n                            IV\n  Dillon additionally contends that the District Court\nerred in failing to correct two mistakes in his original\nsentence. Under his view of \u00a73582(c)(2), a district court is\nrequired to recalculate a defendant\u2019s sentence. Thus, any\nmistakes committed at the initial sentencing are imposed\nanew if they are not corrected. According to Dillon, the\nDistrict Court in the instant proceeding should have cor\nrected the Booker error that resulted from the initial\nsentencing court\u2019s treatment of the Guidelines as manda\ntory, and it should have adjusted his criminal-history\ncategory, which he now contends was erroneously inflated.\n  Dillon\u2019s arguments in this regard are premised on the\nsame misunderstanding of the scope of \u00a73582(c)(2) pro\nceedings dispelled above. As noted, \u00a73582(c)(2) does not\nauthorize a resentencing. Instead, it permits a sentence\nreduction within the narrow bounds established by the\n14                  DILLON v.

Bound by a sen\u00ad\ntencing regime that was mandatory at the time, the judge\nhad no choice but to sentence Dillon to 322 months of\nimprisonment\u2014nearly 27 years behind bars. The judge\nlater explained that, were it within his discretion, he\nwould have sentenced Dillon to 5 years of imprisonment.\nId., at 62. Had Dillon been sentenced after our decision in\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), the judge\nwould have had that discretion. Instead, the District\nCourt was compelled to mete out a punishment that it\nbelieved to be grossly disproportionate to the offense and,\ntherefore, \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to meet the goals of\nour criminal justice system, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a).\n  The punishment Dillon received was so high, in part,\nbecause at the time of his conviction our drug laws pun\u00ad\nished crack cocaine offenses 100 times more severely than\npowder cocaine offenses. In 2007, as the Court explains,\nsee ante, at 3, the United States Sentencing Commission\n(Commission) proposed a partial fix to this disparity,\nlowering its Guidelines Manual1 ranges for crack cocaine\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The   Guidelines Manual itself contains two types of provisions:\n2                    DILLON v.

See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706\n(Nov. 2009) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007). Pursuant to\nits congressional mandate, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(u), the\nCommission made this change retroactive for those indi\u00ad\nviduals, like Dillon, who were still serving sentences for\ncrack cocaine offenses. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.\n713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).\n   Although Dillon does not have a constitutional right to\nobtain the benefit of the Commission\u2019s change, it is undis\u00ad\nputed that he has a statutory right to do so. Under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2), a federal prisoner \u201cwho has been\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentenc\u00ad\ning range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d by the\nCommission may seek a sentence reduction, but only after\nthe court \u201cconsider[s] the factors set forth in section\n3553(a),\u201d and only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with\napplicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing\nCommission.\u201d Dillon sought such relief. His 322-month\nsentence was reduced to a 270-month sentence\u2014still 17\u00bd\nyears more than the sentencing judge thought necessary\nas an initial matter.\n   In his \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding, Dillon alleged that his\ncircumstances warranted an additional reduction in light\nof the fact that his sentence was \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d\nto effectuate the goals of our sentencing system, \u00a73553(a).\nHe also emphasized that he has been a model inmate\nduring his 17 years in federal prison. Once again, how\u00ad\never, the District Court felt that its hands were tied, this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nguidelines, see 28 U. S.

I use \u201cGuidelines\u201d in this opinion to refer to both the guide\u00ad\nlines as described in \u00a7994(a)(1), as well as more generally to all of the\nprovisions in the Guidelines Manual. The section numbers of both\ntypes of provisions are enumerated identically within the Commission\u2019s\nGuidelines Manual, but their effects, as discussed in more detail herein,\nare different.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

And so,\ngiving the Commission\u2019s statement the effect of law, the\nDistrict Court denied Dillon further relief.\n   Today, the Court holds that in this one limited nook of\nsentencing law, the Commission retains the power to bind\njudges that we struck down in Booker. In my view, the\nCourt\u2019s decision to treat the Commission\u2019s policy state\u00ad\nment as a mandatory command rather than an advisory\nrecommendation is unfaithful to Booker. It is also on\ndubious constitutional footing, as it permits the Commis\u00ad\nsion to exercise a barely constrained form of lawmaking\nauthority. And it is manifestly unjust. I would therefore\nhold that in the context of a \u00a73582(c)(2) sentence modifica\u00ad\ntion proceeding, the District Court may consider, but is\nnot bound by, any applicable policy statements promul\u00ad\ngated by the Commission. In other words, I would apply\nBooker\u2019s remedial holding to \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings.\n                               I\n  Although I did not join JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s remedial\nopinion for the Court in Booker, it is nevertheless clear to\nme that its scope applies to \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings.\n  As an initial matter, it is of no moment that the Booker\nCourt did not excise any portion of \u00a73582 when crafting its\nremedy. At the time, there was nothing in \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2014\nseparate and apart from the Guidelines\u2019 general manda\u00ad\ntory nature\u2014that would have limited the District Court\u2019s\ndiscretion in a \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding. There was, conse\u00ad\nquently, nothing that needed excising. Relief under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) is available if it is \u201cconsistent with\u201d the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s related policy statement. And when we decided\nBooker, the particular policy statement at issue,\n4                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a71B1.10(b), had no explicit binding effect.2\n  Prior to our decision in Booker, the Guidelines were\nmandatory only by virtue of congressional mandate, and\nnot by virtue of Commission decree. See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73553(b)(1). Following Booker, the Commission\u2019s policy\nstatement in \u00a71B1.10 took effect in March 2008. That\nstatement, I will explain more fully in Part II, infra, is\nnow the only source of binding authority in \u00a73582(c)(2)\nproceedings, as it purports to have the effect of reinstating\na mandatory Guidelines regime within the context of a\nsentence modification proceeding. It is now the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s policy statement, and not an explicit congressional\nmandate, that makes the Guidelines ranges binding under\n\u00a73582(c)(2).\n  As a matter of textual analysis, divorced from judicial\nprecedent, it is certainly reasonable for the Court to find\nthat the Commission can set mandatory limits on sentence\nreductions under \u00a73582(c)(2). But it is a mistake, in my\nview, to take such a narrow approach to the question\npresented by this case. The Court has turned a blind eye\nto the fundamental sea-change that was our decision in\nBooker.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 From 1989 to 1994, the policy statement in \u00a71B1.10 also contained\n\nwhat could be described fairly as a limitation on the \u201camount\u201d of an\navailable sentence reduction. See USSG \u00a71B1.10(c)(2) (Nov. 1990) (\u201c[A]\nreduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment . . . may, in no event,\nexceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline\nrange applicable to the defendant . . . has been lowered\u201d). In 1994, as\npart of Amendment 504 to the Guidelines Manual, the Commission\ndeleted this provision, explaining that this \u201crather complex subsection\u201d\nwas an \u201cunnecessary restriction on the court\u2019s consideration of a\nrevised sentence.\u201d USSG, App. C, Amdt. 504 (effective Nov. 1, 1994).\nLater, in an \u201cApplication Note,\u201d the Commission indicated that \u201cthe\namended guideline range\u201d \u201climit[s] the extent to which an eligible\ndefendant\u2019s sentence may be reduced.\u201d Id., Amdt. 548 (effective Nov. 1,\n1997). The bottom line is that it was the Guidelines\u2019 mandatory nature,\nand not the effect of a policy statement, that made the Guidelines\nranges binding in an 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   It is useful to put Booker in context. During the delib\u00ad\nerations that led to the enactment of the Sentencing Re\u00ad\nform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73551 et seq., 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7991, et seq., Congress considered\u2014and rejected\u2014a pro\u00ad\nposal that would have made the Guidelines only advisory.\nSee Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 387 (1989).\nUltimately, the decision to authorize the Commission to\nissue rules that \u201chave the force and effect of laws\u201d gener\u00ad\nated a serious debate over the constitutionality of the\nCommission itself. See id., at 413 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   While we resolved that constitutional debate in the\nCommission\u2019s favor in Mistretta, it became apparent dur\u00ad\ning the next two decades that the mandatory character of\nthe Guidelines, coupled with the practice of judicial fact\u00ad\nfinding, not only produced a host of excessively severe\nsentences but also created an unacceptable risk of depriv\u00ad\ning defendants of long-settled constitutional protections.\nSee, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490\n(2000) (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior convic\u00ad\ntion, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); Ring v.\nArizona, 536 U. S. 584, 602 (2002) (holding that \u201c[i]f a\nState makes an increase in a defendant\u2019s authorized pun\u00ad\nishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u2014no\nmatter how the State labels it\u2014must be found by a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296, 304 (2004) (holding that \u201c[w]hen a judge inflicts\npunishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow,\nthe jury has not found all the facts \u2018which the law makes\nessential to the punishment,\u2019 and the judge exceeds his\nproper authority\u201d (citation omitted)).\n   Over a series of cases, we arrived at our present under\u00ad\nstanding of determinate sentencing schemes: They are\nconstitutionally infirm if they mandate enhanced punish\u00ad\nments based on facts found only by a judge by a prepon\u00ad\n6                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nderance of the evidence. By restoring the principles out\u00ad\nlined in landmark cases such as In re Winship, 397 U. S.\n358 (1970), Apprendi and its progeny fundamentally\nchanged the landscape of modern sentencing law,3 and in\nso doing paved the way for Booker.\n   The Booker Court considered whether the Sentencing\nReform Act\u2019s mandatory determinate sentencing scheme\ninfringed the jury-trial right. In the first of two opinions,\nwe held that the two applications of the Guidelines before\nus violated the Sixth Amendment because the sentencing\njudge in each case imposed a more severe sentence than\nthe facts found by the jury warranted. 543 U. S., at 235.\nWe recognized that if the Guidelines \u201ccould be read as\nmerely advisory provisions that recommended, rather\nthan required, the selection of particular sentences in\nresponse to differing sets of facts, their use would not\nimplicate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id., at 233. But we\nrejected such an advisory reading of the Guidelines, as\nthey then stood. Id., at 234. To satisfy constitutional\nguarantees, we explained that any fact that has the effect\nof increasing the mandatory range must be \u201cestablished by\na plea of guilty or . . . must be admitted by the defendant\nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at\n244. Otherwise, the sentence would violate the Sixth (and\nthe Fifth) Amendment.\n   In light of the potential for mandatory Guidelines sen\u00ad\ntences to violate the Constitution, the Court had to elect\namong possible remedies. As I explained in my dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s second Booker opinion (the remedial one),\nthere was no need to find any constitutional infirmity in\nany provision of the Sentencing Reform Act to provide\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See United States v.

See id., at 272\u2013303\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Notwithstanding the\nfact that the Court could have retained the Guidelines\u2019\nmandatory prescriptive effect in a manner consonant with\nthe jury-trial right, the Court nevertheless adopted a\nbroad remedy that recast the Guidelines in their entirety.\n   That change did not respond to a determination that the\nmandatory Guidelines regime itself violated the Sixth\nAmendment. Neither my opinion for the Court with re\u00ad\nspect to our constitutional holding, nor JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s\nremedial opinion, contained any such determination.\nInstead, the Court\u2019s decision to make the Guidelines dis\u00ad\ncretionary rested entirely on the majority\u2019s judgment that\nCongress would have preferred that result to either an\nincrease in the jury\u2019s role in making factual findings or a\ndecision invalidating the entire regime. Id., at 249. When\nCongress was wrestling with the Sentencing Reform Act of\n1984, it did not foresee Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely. The\nCourt made a policy-based prediction that, were Congress\nto have had such foresight, it would not have elected\u2014in\nany respect\u2014a mandatory sentencing regime.\n   The Court openly acknowledged this methodology:\n    \u201cIn essence, in what follows, we explain both (1) why\n    Congress would likely have preferred the total invali\u00ad\n    dation of the Act to an Act with the Court\u2019s Sixth\n    Amendment requirement engrafted onto it, and (2)\n    why Congress would likely have preferred the excision\n    of some of the Act, namely the Act\u2019s mandatory lan\u00ad\n    guage, to the invalidation of the entire Act. That is to\n    say, in light of today\u2019s holding, we compare maintain\u00ad\n    ing the Act as written with jury factfinding added (the\n    dissenters\u2019 proposed remedy) to the total invalidation\n8                       DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                            STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n       of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have\n       preferred the latter. We then compare our own rem\u00ad\n       edy to the total invalidation of the statute, and con\u00ad\n       clude that Congress would have preferred our rem\u00ad\n       edy.\u201d 543 U. S., at 249.\n  Thus, rather than \u201cmaintaining the Act as written with\njury factfinding added,\u201d ibid., the Court opted to alter the\nCommission\u2019s power in a more fundamental way: It did\naway with a fixed, determinate sentencing regime based\non mandatory Guidelines. Henceforth the Commission\nwould guide and advise federal courts in the exercise of\ntheir sentencing authority. But the Commission would\nnot bind.\n  The Court held as follows:\n         \u201cWe answer the question of remedy by finding the\n       provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes\n       the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(b)(1)\n       (Supp. IV), incompatible with today\u2019s constitutional\n       holding. We conclude that this provision must be sev\u00ad\n       ered and excised, as must one other statutory section,\n       \u00a73742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which depends upon\n       the Guidelines\u2019 mandatory nature. So modified, the\n       federal sentencing statute, see Sentencing Reform Act\n       of 1984 (Sentencing Act), as amended, 18 U. S. C.\n       \u00a73551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7991 et seq., makes the\n       Guidelines effectively advisory. It requires a sentenc\u00ad\n       ing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C.\n       \u00a73553(a)(4) (Supp. IV), but it permits the court to tai\u00ad\n       lor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as\n       well, see \u00a73553(a).\u201d Id., at 245\u2013246.\n   The only fair way to read the Booker majority\u2019s remedy\nis that it eliminated the mandatory features of the Guide\u00ad\nlines\u2014all of them.4 It is true that the Court explicitly\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 See   also, e.g., Booker, 543 U.

But there\nwas not, at the time, even a whisper of a suggestion that\nany other mandatory provision existed or that any should\nbe preserved.5\n   Were it not clear from the foregoing discussion of Booker\nitself, our post-Booker decisions have repeatedly empha\u00ad\nsized the completely advisory nature of the Guidelines.\nSee, e.g., Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S. 270, 286\u2013\n287 (2007) (\u201cUnder the system described in JUSTICE\nBREYER\u2019s opinion for the Court in Booker, judges would no\nlonger be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the\nGuidelines. But they would be obliged to \u2018take account of\u2019\nthat range along with the sentencing goals Congress\nenumerated in the [Sentencing Reform Act of 1984] at 18\nU. S.

(\u201cThe other approach, which we now adopt, would (through \n\nseverance and excision of two provisions) make the Guidelines system\nadvisory while maintaining a strong connection between the sentence\nimposed and the offender\u2019s real conduct\u2014a connection important to the\nincreased uniformity of sentencing that Congress intended its Guide\u00ad\nlines system to achieve\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 254 (\u201cCongress would\nhave preferred no mandatory system to the system the dissenters\nenvisage\u201d); id., at 264 (\u201cFinally, the Act without its \u2018mandatory\u2019 provi\u00ad\nsion and related language remains consistent with Congress\u2019 initial and\nbasic sentencing intent. . . .

Nor is it\nrelevant that Dillon has no right to be present at a pro\u00ad\nceeding under \u00a73582(c)(2), ante, at 9\u201310, or that a sentence\nreduction proceeding may not be \u201cconstitutionally com\u00ad\npelled,\u201d ante, at 10\u201311. The Court\u2019s general reliance on\nBooker in this case, see ante, at 11\u201312, is odd because the\nBooker Court explained its belief \u201cthat Congress would not\nhave authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a\nnonmandatory system in others,\u201d 543 U. S., at 266. Yet,\nthis is precisely the system the Court approves today.\n  Approaching this case as the Booker Court did, one must\nask whether it is likely that a fully informed Congress\nwould have created this kind of Commission: one endowed\nwith vast responsibilities for drafting advisory Guidelines\nand policy statements, but also with the tiniest sliver of\nlawmaking power to tie the hands of a district court\u2019s\nexercise of grace under \u00a73582(c)(2). I think the answer is\nobvious.\n                            II\n  My understanding of the scope of the Booker remedy is\nreinforced by an additional consideration: The Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s policy statement, to which the Court today allows\nbinding effect, may exceed the scope of the Commission\u2019s\npowers. No one disputes that Congress could have re\u00ad\njected the Court\u2019s remedial holding in Booker if it so\nwished. Instead, it is the Commission that has rejected\nBooker\u2019s application to \u00a73582(c)(2), by purporting to give\nmandatory force to its own policy statement. That action\npresses the bounds of the authority Congress validly gave\nthe Commission in 1984, for it is not clear that Congress\nhas authorized the Commission to create this type of\npolicy statement or to circumvent a decision such as\nBooker on its own accord.\n  We have been quite permissive of congressional delega\u00ad\n12               DILLON v.

That question has now\nreared its head, and in my view it raises separation-of\u00ad\npowers concerns significantly more difficult than those\npresented in Mistretta.\n  First, I am doubtful that Congress authorized the type\nof \u201cpolicy statement\u201d we find in USSG \u00a71B1.10.

No. 98\u2013225, p. 167 (1983) (explaining\nthat the \u201csentencing judge is required to take the policy\nstatements into account in deciding what sentence to\nimpose,\u201d but that departure from a policy statement is not\nitself grounds for appeal); see also id., at 166 (identifying\npotential use of policy statement to \u201coffe[r] recommenda\u00ad\ntions as to how\u201d to \u201ctrea[t]\u201d \u201cin the future\u201d \u201cexisting dis\u00ad\nparities which are not adequately cured by the guide\u00ad\nlines\u201d).    Congress reserved binding effect for the\nCommission\u2019s \u201cguidelines,\u201d which the Commission was to\npromulgate pursuant to a distinct statutory provision,\n\u00a7994(a)(1). The Sentencing Reform Act thus drew a basic\ndistinction: Guidelines would bind; policy statements\nwould advise.\n   Given that distinction, it is significant that Congress\nelected to use the Commission\u2019s policy-statement power to\nset limitations on the sentencing modification procedures,\nrather than invoking the Commission\u2019s Guidelines power.\nThe Commission is now trying to use a policy statement to\nhave the mandatory effect of a guideline\u2014inverting the\nSentencing Reform Act\u2019s original design. I find no provi\u00ad\nsion within \u00a7994(a)(2) that would authorize the Commis\u00ad\nsion, via a policy statement, to create a binding Guidelines\nregime. With respect to the type of action the Commission\nhas taken, there is certainly no provision that even ap\u00ad\nproximates the detailed prescriptions on the Commission\u2019s\npower we considered in Mistretta.\n   Moreover, not only does nothing in \u00a7994(a)(2) appear to\nauthorize this type of policy statement, but there is also\nnothing that appears to authorize the Commission, by its\nown fiat, to limit the effect of our decision in Booker.\n   How to respond to Booker, and whether to retain man\u00ad\ndatory Guidelines, was a decision for Congress\u2014and\nCongress alone.

That Congress\nhas declined to disturb Booker in the five years since its\nissuance demonstrates not only that JUSTICE BREYER is\nmore clairvoyant than I am, but also that Congress has\nacquiesced to a discretionary Guidelines regime.

And without such guidance, I fear that,\nin promulgating USSG \u00a71B1.10, the Commission may\nhave made the type of \u201cbasic policy decisio[n]\u201d that\nJUSTICE SCALIA reminded us is the province of the Legis\u00ad\nlature, Mistretta, 488 U.

Standing in Dillon\u2019s way presently are two pro\u00ad\nvisions of \u00a71B1.10, revised contemporaneously with the\nCommission\u2019s decision to make its amendments to the\ncrack cocaine offense Guidelines retroactive.\n   There can be no question that the purpose of the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s amendments to its policy statement in \u00a71B1.10\nwas to circumvent the Booker remedy.

In other words,\nthe Commission told federal courts that its Guidelines, at\nleast in \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings, remain mandatory and\nbinding.\n  Had the Commission taken it upon itself, by issuance of\na general policy statement, to make its Guidelines manda\u00ad\ntory but subject to jury findings in all cases, we would\neither strike down such an act on separation-of-powers\ngrounds or apply the same remedy we did in Booker to\nrender the statement advisory. It makes little difference,\nin my view, that the Commission has only rejected the\nBooker remedy in this single procedure. The encroach\u00ad\nment is the same, if only more subtle. Any legislative\nresponse to Booker was a decision for Congress to make\u2014\nnot the Commission.\n                              III\n  Separate from the arguments noted above, the Court\u2019s\ndecision today may reflect a concern that a contrary hold\u00ad\ning would discourage the Commission from issuing retro\u00ad\nactive amendments to the Guidelines, owing to a fear of\nburdening the district courts. In what might be described\nas a subtle threat, the Commission has highlighted this\npoint in its amicus brief supporting the Government. The\nbrief explains that holding for Dillon would introduce\nuncertainty into the Commission\u2019s \u201cassessments about the\neffects of retroactivity decisions,\u201d making these decisions\n\u201cvery difficult\u201d and \u201cweigh[ing] against making Guideline\namendments retroactive in the future.\u201d Brief for United\nStates Sentencing Commission as Amicus Curiae 21.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Government\u2019s argument along these lines is less subtle: \u201cTo\n\nforbid the Sentencing Commission from limiting the scope of Section\n3582(c)(2) sentence reduction proceedings to the scope of the amend\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. \u00a7994(o). And Con\u00ad\ngress has commanded that the Commission \u201cshall specify\nin what circumstances\u201d an amendment is retroactive,\nindicating that most, if not all, substantial amendments\nare to receive some type of retroactive effect. \u00a7994(u); see\nalso S.

In other\nwords, while Congress has left the retroactivity decision to\nthe Commission\u2019s discretion, it has done so with the pre\u00ad\nsumption that some form of retroactive relief is appropri\u00ad\nate when a Guidelines amendment is nontrivial.8 I cannot\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nments themselves would inevitably discourage the Sentencing Commis\u00ad\nsion from ever authorizing sentence reductions.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 37.\n  8 As the Court notes, I do agree that \u00a7994(u) authorizes the Commis\u00ad\n\nsion to determine the retroactive effect of sentence reductions. Ante, at\n13. I understand \u00a7994(u) as directing the Commission to prescribe the\nretroactive effect, if any, of its Guidelines amendments. The power to\nmake retroactivity determinations is meaningfully different, however,\nfrom the other power the Court claims for the Commission. In granting\nthe former power, Congress has instructed the Commission to perform\na gate keeping function by determining which individuals are eligible\nfor relief pursuant to \u00a73582(c)(2). By contrast, the other power the\nCourt claims for the Commission today is the type of mandatory sen\u00ad\ntencing authority at issue in Booker. Contrary to the Court\u2019s conclu\u00ad\nsion, the Commission after Booker does not have the power to bind the\ndistrict court in setting a particular sentence.\n  I also cannot accept the Court\u2019s broad understanding of the power\nthe Commission derives from \u00a7994(u), see ante, at 8, because it suffers\nfrom the same delegation concerns I discussed above, see supra, 11\u201316.\n18                 DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\naccept that the Commission would ignore its obligations,\nand would withhold retroactive application of a Guidelines\nreduction, simply because a judge would have discretion\nto enter a below-Guidelines sentence in a \u00a73582(c)(2)\nproceeding.\n   Undoubtedly, discretionary application of the Guidelines\nin \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings would impose a greater burden\non the district courts. Such a process would require case\u00ad\nspecific evaluations rather than the rote, two-level reduc\u00ad\ntions the Commission envisioned when it made Amend\u00ad\nment 706 retroactive. But it is important to remember\nthat \u00a73582(c)(2) already requires the district court to\nconsider the \u00a73553(a) factors when it determines whether\nto grant a reduction, as well as the extent of the reduction.\nAnd any additional consideration of evidence proffered to\njustify a downward departure need not create a great deal\nof work. Indeed, it need not create any particular adver\u00ad\nsarial process at all: The Commission could simply advise\nthe district courts to review paper submissions, including\nthe original presentence report and objections, as well as\nany new submissions. By now, courts are intimately\nfamiliar with our post-Booker sentencing regime and the\ndiscretionary application of the \u00a73553(a) factors.\n   The facts of Dillon\u2019s case show why any additional bur\u00ad\nden on the courts caused by applying Booker\u2019s remedial\nholding likely pales in comparison to the benefit of achiev\u00ad\ning more tailored, proportionate sentences for those indi\u00ad\nviduals currently serving terms of imprisonment that\nexceed what is \u201cnecessary\u201d to meet the goals of our sen\u00ad\ntencing system, \u00a73553(a).

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 09\u20136338. Argued March 30, 2010\u2014Decided June 17, 2010\nIn 1993, petitioner Dillon was convicted of, inter alia, crack and powder\n  cocaine offenses, which produced a base offense level of 38 and a\n  Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court\n  sentenced him at the bottom of the range for those counts. After the\n  Sentencing Commission amended the Guidelines to reduce the base\n  offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine, USSG\n  Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706, and made that amendment retroactive,\n  USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 713, Dillon moved for a sentence reduc\n  tion under 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2). That provision authorizes a\n  district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence pursuant to a\n  Guidelines amendment if a reduction is consistent with the Commis\n  sion\u2019s policy statements. The relevant policy statement, USSG\n  \u00a71B1.10, precludes a court from reducing a sentence \u201cto a term that is\n  less than the minimum of the amended guidelines range\u201d except in\n  limited circumstances. In addition to the two-level reduction author\n  ized by the amendment, Dillon sought a variance below the amended\n  Guidelines range, contending that United States v. Booker, 543 U. S.\n  220, authorized the exercise of such discretion. The District Court\n  imposed a sentence at the bottom of the revised range but declined to\n  grant a further reduction. Finding Booker inapplicable to \u00a73582(c)(2)\n  proceedings, the court concluded that the Commission\u2019s directives in\n  \u00a71B1.10 constrained it to impose a sentence within the amended\n  Guidelines range. The Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Booker\u2019s holdings do not apply to \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings and\n therefore do not require treating \u00a71B1.10(b) as advisory. Pp. 6\u201314.\n    (a) The statute\u2019s text and narrow scope belie Dillon\u2019s characteriza\n tion of proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2) as \u201cresentencing\u201d proceedings\n governed by the same principles as other sentencing proceedings. In\n2                      DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    stead, \u00a73582(c)(2) authorizes only a limited adjustment to an other\n    wise final sentence. This conclusion is further supported by the sub\n    stantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence\n    modification proceedings, charging it with determining whether and\n    to what extent a Guidelines amendment will be retroactive, 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a7994(u), and authorizing a court to grant a reduction under\n    \u00a73582(c)(2) only \u201cif [it] is consistent with applicable policy statements\n    issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Section 3582(c)(2) estab\n    lishes a two-step inquiry: A court must (1) determine the scope of the\n    reduction, if any, authorized by \u00a71B1.10, and then (2) consider\n    whether the authorized reduction is warranted according to the ap\n    plicable \u00a73553(a) factors. At step one, the court must follow the\n    Commission\u2019s instructions in \u00a71B1.10 to impose a term of imprison\n    ment within the amended Guidelines range unless the sentencing\n    court originally imposed a below-Guidelines sentence. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2).\n    Because reference to \u00a73553(a) is appropriate only at step two, that\n    provision does not transform \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings into plenary re\n    sentencing proceedings. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (b) Given \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s limited scope and purpose, proceedings un\n    der that section do not implicate Booker. The section represents a\n    congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of\n    later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guide\n    lines. Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a\n    judge at a \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the pre\n    scribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judge\u2019s ex\n    ercise of discretion within that range. That exercise does not contra\n    vene the Sixth Amendment, even if it is informed by judge-found\n    facts. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481. Thus, Dillon\u2019s\n    Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District Court\u2019s\n    adherence to \u00a71B1.10\u2019s instruction to consider a reduction only within\n    the amended Guidelines range. Dillon\u2019s argument that Booker\u2019s re\n    medial opinion nonetheless requires the Guidelines to be treated as\n    advisory in such proceedings is unpersuasive given that proceedings\n    under \u00a73582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other sentencing\n    proceedings. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (c) Also rejected is Dillon\u2019s argument that the District Court should\n    have corrected other mistakes in his original sentence, namely, a\n    Booker error resulting from the initial sentencing court\u2019s treatment of\n    the Guidelines as mandatory and an alleged error in the calculation\n    of his criminal-history category. Because those aspects of Dillon\u2019s\n    sentence were not affected by the crack-cocaine Guidelines amend\n    ment, they are outside the scope of the \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding, and\n    the District Court properly declined to address them.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 17, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A federal court generally \u201cmay not modify a term of\nimprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73582(c). Congress has provided an exception to that rule\n\u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that\nhas subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Com\nmission.\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2). In those circumstances, \u00a73582(c)(2)\nauthorizes a court to reduce the term of imprisonment \u201cif\nsuch a reduction is consistent with\u201d applicable Commis\nsion policy statements. The policy statement governing\n\u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings instructs courts not to reduce a\nterm of imprisonment below the minimum of an amended\nsentencing range except to the extent the original term of\nimprisonment was below the range then applicable. See\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(2) (Nov. 2009) (USSG). This case presents the\nquestion whether our decision in United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220 (2005), which rendered the Guidelines advi\nsory to remedy the Sixth Amendment problems associated\nwith a mandatory sentencing regime, requires treating\n\u00a71B1.10(b) as nonbinding. We conclude that Booker does\n2                DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnot demand that result.\n                              I\n   The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA or Act), 98\nStat. 1987, established the Sentencing Commission and\nauthorized it to promulgate Sentencing Guidelines and to\nissue policy statements regarding the Guidelines\u2019 applica\ntion. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991, 994(a). The Act also charged\nthe Commission with periodically reviewing and revising\nthe Guidelines. See \u00a7994(o). When a revision reduces the\nGuidelines range for a given offense, the Commission must\ndetermine \u201cin what circumstances and by what amount\nthe sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment\nfor the offense may be reduced.\u201d \u00a7994(u).\n   As enacted, the SRA made the Sentencing Guidelines\nbinding. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 233\u2013234. Except in\nlimited circumstances, district courts lacked discretion to\ndepart from the Guidelines range. See Burns v. United\nStates, 501 U. S. 129, 133 (1991). Under that regime, facts\nfound by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence often\nincreased the mandatory Guidelines range and permitted\nthe judge to impose a sentence greater than that sup\nported by the facts established by the jury verdict or guilty\nplea. See Booker, 543 U. S., at 235. We held in Booker\nthat treating the Guidelines as mandatory in these cir\ncumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of crimi\nnal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every\nelement of an offense proved by the Government beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Id., at 243\u2013244.\n   To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the\nGuidelines advisory by invalidating two provisions of the\nSRA: 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which\ngenerally required a sentencing court to impose a sentence\nwithin the applicable Guidelines range, and \u00a73742(e)\n(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of\nreview on appeal, including de novo review of Guidelines\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndepartures. 543 U. S., at 259. \u201cWith these two sections\nexcised (and statutory cross-references to the two sections\nconsequently invalidated),\u201d we held that \u201cthe remainder of\nthe Act satisfies the Court\u2019s constitutional requirements.\u201d\nIbid. Booker thus left intact other provisions of the SRA,\nincluding those giving the Commission authority to revise\nthe Guidelines, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(o) (2006 ed.), and to de\ntermine when and to what extent a revision will be retro\nactive, \u00a7994(u).\n   With respect to drug-trafficking offenses, the Sentencing\nGuidelines establish a defendant\u2019s base offense level ac\ncording to the type and weight of the drug. See USSG\n\u00a7\u00a72D1.1(a), (c). When the Commission first promulgated\nthe Guidelines in 1987, it adopted the 100-to-1 ratio se\nlected by Congress in setting mandatory minimum sen\ntences in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207.\nUnder that framework, the Commission \u201ctreated every\ngram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of\npowder cocaine.\u201d Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S.\n85, 96 (2007). The Commission later sought to alleviate\nthe disparity produced by this ratio. After several failed\nattempts at reform, see id., at 99, the Commission in 2007\namended the Guidelines to reduce by two levels the base\noffense level associated with each quantity of crack co\ncaine. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (effective Nov.\n1, 2007). In 2008, the Commission made that amendment\nretroactive. See id., Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).\n   When the Commission makes a Guidelines amendment\nretroactive, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2) authorizes a district\ncourt to reduce an otherwise final sentence that is based\non the amended provision. Any reduction must be consis\ntent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sen\ntencing Commission.       The relevant policy statement,\nUSSG \u00a71B1.10, instructs courts proceeding under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) to substitute the amended Guidelines range\nwhile \u201cleav[ing] all other guideline application decisions\n4                    DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nunaffected.\u201d \u00a71B1.10(b)(1).1 Under \u00a73582(c)(2), a court\nmay then grant a reduction within the amended Guide\nlines range if it determines that one is warranted \u201cafter\nconsidering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the\nextent that they are applicable.\u201d2 Except in limited cir\ncumstances, however, \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A) forecloses a court\nacting under \u00a73582(c)(2) from reducing a sentence \u201cto a\nterm that is less than the minimum of the amended guide\nline range.\u201d\n                              II\n  A jury convicted petitioner Percy Dillon in 1993 of con\nspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to\ndistribute more than 500 grams of powder cocaine and\nmore than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7846, possession with the intent to distribute\nmore than 500 grams of powder cocaine in violation of\n\u00a7841(a)(1), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a\ndrug-trafficking offense in violation of 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7924(c)(1). Dillon\u2019s convictions exposed him to a statutory\nsentencing range of 10 years to life for the conspiracy, 5\nto-40 years for cocaine possession, and a mandatory mini\nmum sentence of 5 years for the firearm offense, to be\nserved consecutively to the sentence for the drug offenses.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Sentencing Commission substantially revised \u00a71B1.10 in March\n\n2008, see USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 712 (Nov. 2009) (effective Mar. 3,\n2008), roughly three months before the District Court\u2019s decision in this\ncase. Because the current version of the relevant Guidelines provisions\nis not meaningfully different from the version in effect at the time of\nthe District Court\u2019s decision, references in this opinion are to the\ncurrent, 2009 edition of the Guidelines.\n   2 Section 3553(a) provides that a \u201ccourt shall impose a sentence suffi\n\ncient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set\nforth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d and it enumerates several\nfactors a court \u201cshall consider\u201d in determining an appropriate sentence,\nincluding \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history\nand characteristics of the defendant,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(1).\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   At sentencing, the District Court made additional find\nings of fact and concluded that Dillon was responsible for\n1.5 kilograms of crack and 1.6 kilograms of powder co\ncaine. Under USSG \u00a72D1.1, those drug quantities pro\nduced a base offense level of 38. After offsetting adjust\nments for acceptance of responsibility, \u00a73E1.1, and\nreckless endangerment during flight, \u00a73C1.2, Dillon\u2019s total\noffense level remained 38. Coupled with a criminal\nhistory category of II,3 that offense level produced a then\nmandatory Guidelines range of 262-to-327 months\u2019 im\nprisonment for the drug counts.\n   The court sentenced Dillon at the bottom of the Guide\nlines range for those counts, followed by a mandatory 60\nmonth sentence for the firearm count, for a total sentence\nof 322 months\u2019 imprisonment. At Dillon\u2019s sentencing, the\ncourt described the term of imprisonment as \u201centirely too\nhigh for the crime [Dillon] committed.\u201d App. 13. Perceiv\ning no basis for departing from the then-mandatory Sen\ntencing Guidelines, the District Court felt constrained to\nimpose a sentence within the prescribed range. The Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed Dillon\u2019s convic\ntions and sentence on appeal. See 100 F. 3d 949 (1996).\n   After the Sentencing Commission made the amendment\nto the crack-cocaine Guidelines retroactive in 2008, Dillon\nfiled a pro se motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to\n\u00a73582(c)(2). In the motion, Dillon asked the court to grant\nnot just the two-level reduction authorized by the amend\nment but also a further reduction consistent with the\nsentencing factors found in \u00a73553(a). Based largely on his\npostsentencing conduct, including his determined pursuit\nof educational and community-outreach opportunities,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Probation Office based Dillon\u2019s criminal-history assessment on\ntwo prior misdemeanor convictions, one for possession of marijuana and\none for resisting arrest. Dillon did not object to that calculation of his\ncriminal-history score.\n6                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nDillon contended that a variance from the amended Guide\nlines range was warranted in his case. He further urged\nthat, after Booker, the court was authorized to grant such\na variance because the amended Guidelines range was\nadvisory notwithstanding any contrary statement in\n\u00a71B1.10.\n   The District Court reduced Dillon\u2019s sentence to 270\nmonths\u2014the term at the bottom of the revised Guidelines\nrange.4 But the court declined to go further. Concluding\nthat the sentencing proceedings at issue in Booker are\nreadily distinguishable from those under \u00a73582(c)(2), the\ncourt found Booker\u2019s holdings inapplicable to the instant\nproceeding and accordingly held that it lacked authority to\nimpose a sentence inconsistent with \u00a71B1.10.\n   The Third Circuit affirmed. 572 F. 3d 146, 150 (2009).\nThe court noted that \u00a73582(c)(2) is codified in a different\nsection than the provisions invalidated in Booker and\ncontains no cross-reference to those provisions. Finding\nno other indication that Booker \u201cobviate[d] the congres\nsional directive in \u00a73582(c)(2) that a sentence reduction\npursuant to that section be consistent with Sentencing\nCommission policy statements,\u201d 572 F. 3d, at 149, the\nThird Circuit held that \u00a71B1.10 is binding. It therefore\nagreed that the District Court lacked authority to reduce\nDillon\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range.\n   We granted certiorari to consider Booker\u2019s applicability\nto \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings. 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                            III \n\n                             A\n\n  \u201c[A] judgment of conviction that includes [a sentence of\nimprisonment] constitutes a final judgment\u201d and may not\nbe modified by a district court except in limited circum\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The revised sentence reflects a 210-month term of imprisonment for\n\nthe narcotics offenses and a mandatory, consecutive 60-month term for\nthe firearm offense.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances. \u00a73582(b). Section 3582(c)(2) establishes an ex\nception to the general rule of finality \u201cin the case of a\ndefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprison\nment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently\nbeen lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to\n28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(o)\u201d and made retroactive pursuant to\n\u00a7994(u). In such cases, Congress has authorized courts to\n\u201creduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the\nfactors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they\nare applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with appli\ncable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commis\nsion.\u201d \u00a73582(c)(2).\n   Characterizing proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2) as \u201cresen\ntencing\u201d proceedings, Dillon contends that \u201c[t]here is no\npractical or functional difference between a resentencing\npursuant to \u00a73582(c)(2) and any other resentencing.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioner 18. Accordingly, Dillon urges, the same\nprinciples that govern other sentencing proceedings like\nwise govern \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings, and courts have\nauthority under \u00a73582(c)(2) to vary from the revised\nGuidelines range consistent with \u00a73553(a), see\nKimbrough, 552 U. S., at 101. Dillon cites as support for\nthis view \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s instruction to consider the factors\nin \u00a73553(a) in determining whether a sentence reduction\nis warranted. Under Dillon\u2019s approach, Booker would\npreclude the Commission from issuing a policy statement\nthat generally forecloses below-Guidelines sentences at\n\u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings, as USSG \u00a71B1.10 purports to do.\nDillon thus asks us to excise the mandatory language of\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A) and treat that provision as advisory, just\nas we did the offending statutory provisions in Booker.\n   The language of \u00a73582(c)(2) belies Dillon\u2019s characteriza\ntion of proceedings under that section. By its terms,\n\u00a73582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentenc\ning proceeding. Instead, it provides for the \u201cmodif[ication\nof] a term of imprisonment\u201d by giving courts the power to\n8                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201creduce\u201d an otherwise final sentence in circumstances\nspecified by the Commission.         Compare 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7994(a)(2)(C) (referring to \u00a73582(c)(2) as a \u201csentence modi\nfication provisio[n]\u201d), with 18 U. S. C. \u00a73742(f) (authoriz\ning courts of appeals to remand \u201cfor further sentencing\u201d\nupon a finding of error), and \u00a73742(g) (establishing the\nterms of \u201csentencing upon remand\u201d and describing the\nproceeding as a \u201cresentenc[ing]\u201d (capitalization omitted)).\nIt is also notable that the provision applies only to a lim\nited class of prisoners\u2014namely, those whose sentence was\nbased on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the\nCommission. Section 3582(c)(2)\u2019s text, together with its\nnarrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize\nonly a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence\nand not a plenary resentencing proceeding.\n   The substantial role Congress gave the Commission\nwith respect to sentence-modification proceedings further\nsupports this conclusion. The SRA charges the Commis\nsion both with deciding whether to amend the Guidelines,\n\u00a7994(o), and with determining whether and to what extent\nan amendment will be retroactive, \u00a7994(u).5 A court\u2019s\npower under \u00a73582(c)(2) thus depends in the first instance\non the Commission\u2019s decision not just to amend the Guide\nlines but to make the amendment retroactive. The court is\nalso constrained by the Commission\u2019s statements dictating\n\u201cby what amount\u201d the sentence of a prisoner serving a\nterm of imprisonment affected by the amendment \u201cmay be\nreduced.\u201d \u00a7994(u); see also Braxton v. United States, 500\nU. S. 344, 348 (1991) (noting that the Commission imple\nmented that power through \u00a71B1.10).\n   Read in this context, \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2019s reference to \u00a73553(a)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 We\n       do not respond to the dissent\u2019s separation-of-powers discussion,\nsee post, at 11\u201316 (opinion of STEVENS, J.), as that issue is not fairly\nencompassed within the questions presented and was not briefed by the\nparties.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoes not undermine our narrow view of proceedings under\nthe former provision. Section 3582(c)(2) instructs a dis\ntrict court to \u201cconside[r] the factors set forth in section\n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d but it\nauthorizes a reduction on that basis only \u201cif such a reduc\ntion is consistent with applicable policy statements issued\nby the Sentencing Commission\u201d\u2014namely, \u00a71B1.10. The\nstatute thus establishes a two-step inquiry. A court must\nfirst determine that a reduction is consistent with \u00a71B1.10\nbefore it may consider whether the authorized reduction is\nwarranted, either in whole or in part, according to the\nfactors set forth in \u00a73553(a).\n   Following this two-step approach, a district court pro\nceeding under \u00a73582(c)(2) does not impose a new sentence\nin the usual sense. At step one, \u00a73582(c)(2) requires the\ncourt to follow the Commission\u2019s instructions in \u00a71B1.10 to\ndetermine the prisoner\u2019s eligibility for a sentence modifi\ncation and the extent of the reduction authorized. Specifi\ncally, \u00a71B1.10(b)(1) requires the court to begin by \u201cdeter\nmin[ing] the amended guideline range that would have\nbeen applicable to the defendant\u201d had the relevant\namendment been in effect at the time of the initial sen\ntencing. \u201cIn making such determination, the court shall\nsubstitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for\nthe corresponding guideline provisions that were applied\nwhen the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all\nother guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d Ibid.\n   Consistent with the limited nature of \u00a73582(c)(2) pro\nceedings, \u00a71B1.10(b)(2) also confines the extent of the\nreduction authorized. Courts generally may \u201cnot reduce\nthe defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73582(c)(2) . . . to a term that is less than the minimum of\nthe amended guideline range\u201d produced by the substitu\ntion. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(A). Only if the sentencing court origi\nnally imposed a term of imprisonment below the Guide\nlines range does \u00a71B1.10 authorize a court proceeding\n10               DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nunder \u00a73582(c)(2) to impose a term \u201ccomparably\u201d below the\namended range. \u00a71B1.10(b)(2)(B).\n  At step two of the inquiry, \u00a73582(c)(2) instructs a court\nto consider any applicable \u00a73553(a) factors and determine\nwhether, in its discretion, the reduction authorized by\nreference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted\nin whole or in part under the particular circumstances of\nthe case. Because reference to \u00a73553(a) is appropriate\nonly at the second step of this circumscribed inquiry, it\ncannot serve to transform the proceedings under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) into plenary resentencing proceedings.\n  This understanding of \u00a73582(c)(2) as a narrow exception\nto the rule of finality finds further support outside the\nstatute. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 requires\nthat a defendant be present at \u201csentencing,\u201d see Rule\n43(a)(3), but it excludes from that requirement proceed\nings that \u201cinvolv[e] the correction or reduction of sentence\nunder Rule 35 or 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c),\u201d Rule 43(b)(4). Like\n\u00a73582(c)(2), Rule 35 delineates a limited set of circum\nstances in which a sentence may be corrected or reduced.\nSpecifically, it authorizes a court to \u201ccorrect a sentence\nthat resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear\nerror\u201d within 14 days after sentencing, Rule 35(a), and it\nauthorizes a reduction for substantial assistance on the\nGovernment\u2019s motion, Rule 35(b). Rule 43 therefore sets\nthe proceedings authorized by \u00a73582(c)(2) and Rule 35\napart from other sentencing proceedings.\n                             B\n  Given the limited scope and purpose of \u00a73582(c)(2), we\nconclude that proceedings under that section do not impli\ncate the interests identified in Booker. Notably, the sen\ntence-modification proceedings authorized by \u00a73582(c)(2)\nare not constitutionally compelled. We are aware of no\nconstitutional requirement of retroactivity that entitles\ndefendants sentenced to a term of imprisonment to the\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbenefit of subsequent Guidelines amendments. Rather,\n\u00a73582(c)(2) represents a congressional act of lenity in\ntended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted ad\njustments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines.\n   Viewed that way, proceedings under \u00a73582(c)(2) do not\nimplicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Taking\nthe original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge\nat a \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the\nprescribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only\nthe judge\u2019s exercise of discretion within that range.\n\u201c[J]udges in this country have long exercised discretion of\nthis nature in imposing sentence within [established]\nlimits in the individual case,\u201d and the exercise of such\ndiscretion does not contravene the Sixth Amendment even\nif it is informed by judge-found facts. Apprendi v. New\nJersey, 530 U. S. 466, 481 (2000) (emphasis in original).\nBecause \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings give judges no more than\nthis circumscribed discretion, \u201c[t]here is no encroachment\nhere by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury,\nnor any threat to the jury\u2019s domain as a bulwark at trial\nbetween the State and the accused.\u201d Oregon v. Ice, 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Accordingly, Dillon\u2019s\nSixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District\nCourt\u2019s adherence to the instruction in \u00a71B1.10 to consider\na reduction only within the amended Guidelines range.\n   Dillon contends that, even if \u00a73582(c)(2) does not impli\ncate the constitutional rights vindicated in Booker\u2014\nsomething the dissent appears to concede\u2014the remedial\naspect of the Court\u2019s decision applies to proceedings under\nthat section and requires that the Guidelines be treated as\nadvisory in such proceedings just as they are in other\nsentencing proceedings. In support of his position, Dillon\ninvokes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in United States v.\n12                  DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nHicks, 472 F. 3d 1167, 1170 (2007).6 Relying on our rejec\ntion in Booker of a remedy that would have made the\nGuidelines advisory only in certain cases\u2014namely, when\ntreating them as binding would run afoul of the Sixth\nAmendment, see 543 U. S., at 265\u2013267\u2014the Ninth Circuit\nheld that Booker precludes treating the Guidelines as\nmandatory for purposes of \u00a73582(c)(2) and advisory in\nother contexts, see Hicks, 472 F. 3d, at 1171\u20131172.\n   This argument is unpersuasive. The incomplete remedy\nwe rejected in Booker would have required courts to treat\nthe Guidelines differently in similar proceedings, leading\npotentially to unfair results and considerable administra\ntive challenges. See 543 U. S., at 266. As already ex\nplained, the sentence-modification proceedings authorized\nby \u00a73582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other\nsentencing proceedings. Given the substantially different\npurpose of \u00a73582(c)(2) and the circumscribed nature of\nproceedings under that section, requiring courts to honor\n\u00a71B1.10(b)(2)\u2019s instruction not to depart from the amended\nGuidelines range at such proceedings will create none of\nthe confusion or unfairness that led us in Booker to reject\nthe Government\u2019s argument for a partial fix.\n   The dissent\u2019s contrary conclusion rests on two erroneous\npremises. First, the dissent ignores the fundamental\ndifferences between sentencing and sentence-modification\nproceedings and asserts without explanation that\n\u201c[n]othing turns on\u201d the distinction between them.

For the reasons stated above, the statutory differ\nences between the proceedings are highly significant.\n   Second, the dissent gives short shrift to the fact that,\nafter Booker, the Commission retains at least some au\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Ninth Circuit subsequently agreed to consider en banc Booker\u2019s\napplicability to \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings.

Through \u00a7994(u), Congress\ncharged the Commission with determining \u201cin what cir\ncumstances and by what amount\u201d the sentences of prison\ners affected by Guidelines amendments \u201cmay be reduced.\u201d\nNo one disputes that the Commission\u2019s retroactivity de\nterminations made pursuant to the first part of that au\nthorization are binding. See post, at 17, and n. 8. This\naspect of the Commission\u2019s power emphatically under\nmines the dissent\u2019s insistence that the Guidelines after\nBooker are \u201ccompletely advisory.\u201d Post, at 9. Moreover,\nwhile the dissent criticizes our approach for leaving the\nCommission with only the \u201cthe tiniest sliver of lawmaking\npower,\u201d post, at 11, the dissent would leave the Commis\nsion with an even smaller and less explicable sliver by\ndissecting the authority granted by \u00a7994(u).\n  For all of these reasons, we conclude that neither\nBooker\u2019s constitutional nor remedial holding requires the\nresult that Dillon urges.\n                            IV\n  Dillon additionally contends that the District Court\nerred in failing to correct two mistakes in his original\nsentence. Under his view of \u00a73582(c)(2), a district court is\nrequired to recalculate a defendant\u2019s sentence. Thus, any\nmistakes committed at the initial sentencing are imposed\nanew if they are not corrected. According to Dillon, the\nDistrict Court in the instant proceeding should have cor\nrected the Booker error that resulted from the initial\nsentencing court\u2019s treatment of the Guidelines as manda\ntory, and it should have adjusted his criminal-history\ncategory, which he now contends was erroneously inflated.\n  Dillon\u2019s arguments in this regard are premised on the\nsame misunderstanding of the scope of \u00a73582(c)(2) pro\nceedings dispelled above. As noted, \u00a73582(c)(2) does not\nauthorize a resentencing. Instead, it permits a sentence\nreduction within the narrow bounds established by the\n14                  DILLON v.

Because the aspects of his sentence that\nDillon seeks to correct were not affected by the Commis\nsion\u2019s amendment to \u00a72D1.1, they are outside the scope of\nthe proceeding authorized by \u00a73582(c)(2), and the District\nCourt properly declined to address them.\n                      *    *     *\n For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is\n                                               Affirmed.\n\n     JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the decision of this case.\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

Bound by a sen\u00ad\ntencing regime that was mandatory at the time, the judge\nhad no choice but to sentence Dillon to 322 months of\nimprisonment\u2014nearly 27 years behind bars. The judge\nlater explained that, were it within his discretion, he\nwould have sentenced Dillon to 5 years of imprisonment.\nId., at 62. Had Dillon been sentenced after our decision in\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), the judge\nwould have had that discretion. Instead, the District\nCourt was compelled to mete out a punishment that it\nbelieved to be grossly disproportionate to the offense and,\ntherefore, \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to meet the goals of\nour criminal justice system, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a).\n  The punishment Dillon received was so high, in part,\nbecause at the time of his conviction our drug laws pun\u00ad\nished crack cocaine offenses 100 times more severely than\npowder cocaine offenses. In 2007, as the Court explains,\nsee ante, at 3, the United States Sentencing Commission\n(Commission) proposed a partial fix to this disparity,\nlowering its Guidelines Manual1 ranges for crack cocaine\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 The   Guidelines Manual itself contains two types of provisions:\n2                    DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\noffenses to a 20:1 ratio. See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706\n(Nov. 2009) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007). Pursuant to\nits congressional mandate, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(u), the\nCommission made this change retroactive for those indi\u00ad\nviduals, like Dillon, who were still serving sentences for\ncrack cocaine offenses. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt.\n713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).\n   Although Dillon does not have a constitutional right to\nobtain the benefit of the Commission\u2019s change, it is undis\u00ad\nputed that he has a statutory right to do so. Under 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2), a federal prisoner \u201cwho has been\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentenc\u00ad\ning range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d by the\nCommission may seek a sentence reduction, but only after\nthe court \u201cconsider[s] the factors set forth in section\n3553(a),\u201d and only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with\napplicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing\nCommission.\u201d Dillon sought such relief. His 322-month\nsentence was reduced to a 270-month sentence\u2014still 17\u00bd\nyears more than the sentencing judge thought necessary\nas an initial matter.\n   In his \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding, Dillon alleged that his\ncircumstances warranted an additional reduction in light\nof the fact that his sentence was \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d\nto effectuate the goals of our sentencing system, \u00a73553(a).\nHe also emphasized that he has been a model inmate\nduring his 17 years in federal prison. Once again, how\u00ad\never, the District Court felt that its hands were tied, this\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nguidelines, see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(a)(1), and policy statements, see\n\u00a7944(a)(2). I use \u201cGuidelines\u201d in this opinion to refer to both the guide\u00ad\nlines as described in \u00a7994(a)(1), as well as more generally to all of the\nprovisions in the Guidelines Manual. The section numbers of both\ntypes of provisions are enumerated identically within the Commission\u2019s\nGuidelines Manual, but their effects, as discussed in more detail herein,\nare different.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntime because USSG \u00a71B1.10(b)(2) purports to place a\nmandatory limit on the extent of any sentence reduction\nthat a court may order pursuant to \u00a73582(c)(2). And so,\ngiving the Commission\u2019s statement the effect of law, the\nDistrict Court denied Dillon further relief.\n   Today, the Court holds that in this one limited nook of\nsentencing law, the Commission retains the power to bind\njudges that we struck down in Booker. In my view, the\nCourt\u2019s decision to treat the Commission\u2019s policy state\u00ad\nment as a mandatory command rather than an advisory\nrecommendation is unfaithful to Booker. It is also on\ndubious constitutional footing, as it permits the Commis\u00ad\nsion to exercise a barely constrained form of lawmaking\nauthority. And it is manifestly unjust. I would therefore\nhold that in the context of a \u00a73582(c)(2) sentence modifica\u00ad\ntion proceeding, the District Court may consider, but is\nnot bound by, any applicable policy statements promul\u00ad\ngated by the Commission. In other words, I would apply\nBooker\u2019s remedial holding to \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings.\n                               I\n  Although I did not join JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s remedial\nopinion for the Court in Booker, it is nevertheless clear to\nme that its scope applies to \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings.\n  As an initial matter, it is of no moment that the Booker\nCourt did not excise any portion of \u00a73582 when crafting its\nremedy. At the time, there was nothing in \u00a73582(c)(2)\u2014\nseparate and apart from the Guidelines\u2019 general manda\u00ad\ntory nature\u2014that would have limited the District Court\u2019s\ndiscretion in a \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding. There was, conse\u00ad\nquently, nothing that needed excising. Relief under\n\u00a73582(c)(2) is available if it is \u201cconsistent with\u201d the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s related policy statement. And when we decided\nBooker, the particular policy statement at issue,\n4                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a71B1.10(b), had no explicit binding effect.2\n  Prior to our decision in Booker, the Guidelines were\nmandatory only by virtue of congressional mandate, and\nnot by virtue of Commission decree. See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73553(b)(1). Following Booker, the Commission\u2019s policy\nstatement in \u00a71B1.10 took effect in March 2008. That\nstatement, I will explain more fully in Part II, infra, is\nnow the only source of binding authority in \u00a73582(c)(2)\nproceedings, as it purports to have the effect of reinstating\na mandatory Guidelines regime within the context of a\nsentence modification proceeding. It is now the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s policy statement, and not an explicit congressional\nmandate, that makes the Guidelines ranges binding under\n\u00a73582(c)(2).\n  As a matter of textual analysis, divorced from judicial\nprecedent, it is certainly reasonable for the Court to find\nthat the Commission can set mandatory limits on sentence\nreductions under \u00a73582(c)(2). But it is a mistake, in my\nview, to take such a narrow approach to the question\npresented by this case. The Court has turned a blind eye\nto the fundamental sea-change that was our decision in\nBooker.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 From 1989 to 1994, the policy statement in \u00a71B1.10 also contained\n\nwhat could be described fairly as a limitation on the \u201camount\u201d of an\navailable sentence reduction. See USSG \u00a71B1.10(c)(2) (Nov. 1990) (\u201c[A]\nreduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment . . . may, in no event,\nexceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline\nrange applicable to the defendant . . . has been lowered\u201d). In 1994, as\npart of Amendment 504 to the Guidelines Manual, the Commission\ndeleted this provision, explaining that this \u201crather complex subsection\u201d\nwas an \u201cunnecessary restriction on the court\u2019s consideration of a\nrevised sentence.\u201d USSG, App. C, Amdt. 504 (effective Nov. 1, 1994).\nLater, in an \u201cApplication Note,\u201d the Commission indicated that \u201cthe\namended guideline range\u201d \u201climit[s] the extent to which an eligible\ndefendant\u2019s sentence may be reduced.\u201d Id., Amdt. 548 (effective Nov. 1,\n1997). The bottom line is that it was the Guidelines\u2019 mandatory nature,\nand not the effect of a policy statement, that made the Guidelines\nranges binding in an 18 U. S. C. \u00a73582(c)(2) proceeding.\n                  Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            5\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   It is useful to put Booker in context. During the delib\u00ad\nerations that led to the enactment of the Sentencing Re\u00ad\nform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73551 et seq., 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7991, et seq., Congress considered\u2014and rejected\u2014a pro\u00ad\nposal that would have made the Guidelines only advisory.\nSee Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 387 (1989).\nUltimately, the decision to authorize the Commission to\nissue rules that \u201chave the force and effect of laws\u201d gener\u00ad\nated a serious debate over the constitutionality of the\nCommission itself. See id., at 413 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   While we resolved that constitutional debate in the\nCommission\u2019s favor in Mistretta, it became apparent dur\u00ad\ning the next two decades that the mandatory character of\nthe Guidelines, coupled with the practice of judicial fact\u00ad\nfinding, not only produced a host of excessively severe\nsentences but also created an unacceptable risk of depriv\u00ad\ning defendants of long-settled constitutional protections.\nSee, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490\n(2000) (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior convic\u00ad\ntion, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); Ring v.\nArizona, 536 U. S. 584, 602 (2002) (holding that \u201c[i]f a\nState makes an increase in a defendant\u2019s authorized pun\u00ad\nishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u2014no\nmatter how the State labels it\u2014must be found by a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296, 304 (2004) (holding that \u201c[w]hen a judge inflicts\npunishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow,\nthe jury has not found all the facts \u2018which the law makes\nessential to the punishment,\u2019 and the judge exceeds his\nproper authority\u201d (citation omitted)).\n   Over a series of cases, we arrived at our present under\u00ad\nstanding of determinate sentencing schemes: They are\nconstitutionally infirm if they mandate enhanced punish\u00ad\nments based on facts found only by a judge by a prepon\u00ad\n6                   DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nderance of the evidence. By restoring the principles out\u00ad\nlined in landmark cases such as In re Winship, 397 U. S.\n358 (1970), Apprendi and its progeny fundamentally\nchanged the landscape of modern sentencing law,3 and in\nso doing paved the way for Booker.\n   The Booker Court considered whether the Sentencing\nReform Act\u2019s mandatory determinate sentencing scheme\ninfringed the jury-trial right. In the first of two opinions,\nwe held that the two applications of the Guidelines before\nus violated the Sixth Amendment because the sentencing\njudge in each case imposed a more severe sentence than\nthe facts found by the jury warranted. 543 U. S., at 235.\nWe recognized that if the Guidelines \u201ccould be read as\nmerely advisory provisions that recommended, rather\nthan required, the selection of particular sentences in\nresponse to differing sets of facts, their use would not\nimplicate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id., at 233. But we\nrejected such an advisory reading of the Guidelines, as\nthey then stood. Id., at 234. To satisfy constitutional\nguarantees, we explained that any fact that has the effect\nof increasing the mandatory range must be \u201cestablished by\na plea of guilty or . . . must be admitted by the defendant\nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at\n244. Otherwise, the sentence would violate the Sixth (and\nthe Fifth) Amendment.\n   In light of the potential for mandatory Guidelines sen\u00ad\ntences to violate the Constitution, the Court had to elect\namong possible remedies. As I explained in my dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s second Booker opinion (the remedial one),\nthere was no need to find any constitutional infirmity in\nany provision of the Sentencing Reform Act to provide\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 See United States v.

See id., at 272\u2013303\n(STEVENS, J., dissenting in part). Notwithstanding the\nfact that the Court could have retained the Guidelines\u2019\nmandatory prescriptive effect in a manner consonant with\nthe jury-trial right, the Court nevertheless adopted a\nbroad remedy that recast the Guidelines in their entirety.\n   That change did not respond to a determination that the\nmandatory Guidelines regime itself violated the Sixth\nAmendment. Neither my opinion for the Court with re\u00ad\nspect to our constitutional holding, nor JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s\nremedial opinion, contained any such determination.\nInstead, the Court\u2019s decision to make the Guidelines dis\u00ad\ncretionary rested entirely on the majority\u2019s judgment that\nCongress would have preferred that result to either an\nincrease in the jury\u2019s role in making factual findings or a\ndecision invalidating the entire regime. Id., at 249. When\nCongress was wrestling with the Sentencing Reform Act of\n1984, it did not foresee Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely. The\nCourt made a policy-based prediction that, were Congress\nto have had such foresight, it would not have elected\u2014in\nany respect\u2014a mandatory sentencing regime.\n   The Court openly acknowledged this methodology:\n    \u201cIn essence, in what follows, we explain both (1) why\n    Congress would likely have preferred the total invali\u00ad\n    dation of the Act to an Act with the Court\u2019s Sixth\n    Amendment requirement engrafted onto it, and (2)\n    why Congress would likely have preferred the excision\n    of some of the Act, namely the Act\u2019s mandatory lan\u00ad\n    guage, to the invalidation of the entire Act. That is to\n    say, in light of today\u2019s holding, we compare maintain\u00ad\n    ing the Act as written with jury factfinding added (the\n    dissenters\u2019 proposed remedy) to the total invalidation\n8                       DILLON v.

S., at 249.\n  Thus, rather than \u201cmaintaining the Act as written with\njury factfinding added,\u201d ibid., the Court opted to alter the\nCommission\u2019s power in a more fundamental way: It did\naway with a fixed, determinate sentencing regime based\non mandatory Guidelines. Henceforth the Commission\nwould guide and advise federal courts in the exercise of\ntheir sentencing authority. But the Commission would\nnot bind.\n  The Court held as follows:\n         \u201cWe answer the question of remedy by finding the\n       provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes\n       the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(b)(1)\n       (Supp. IV), incompatible with today\u2019s constitutional\n       holding. We conclude that this provision must be sev\u00ad\n       ered and excised, as must one other statutory section,\n       \u00a73742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which depends upon\n       the Guidelines\u2019 mandatory nature. So modified, the\n       federal sentencing statute, see Sentencing Reform Act\n       of 1984 (Sentencing Act), as amended, 18 U. S. C.\n       \u00a73551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. \u00a7991 et seq., makes the\n       Guidelines effectively advisory. It requires a sentenc\u00ad\n       ing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C.\n       \u00a73553(a)(4) (Supp. IV), but it permits the court to tai\u00ad\n       lor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as\n       well, see \u00a73553(a).\u201d Id., at 245\u2013246.\n   The only fair way to read the Booker majority\u2019s remedy\nis that it eliminated the mandatory features of the Guide\u00ad\nlines\u2014all of them.4 It is true that the Court explicitly\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 See   also, e.g., Booker, 543 U.

(\u201cThe other approach, which we now adopt, would (through \n\nseverance and excision of two provisions) make the Guidelines system\nadvisory while maintaining a strong connection between the sentence\nimposed and the offender\u2019s real conduct\u2014a connection important to the\nincreased uniformity of sentencing that Congress intended its Guide\u00ad\nlines system to achieve\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 254 (\u201cCongress would\nhave preferred no mandatory system to the system the dissenters\nenvisage\u201d); id., at 264 (\u201cFinally, the Act without its \u2018mandatory\u2019 provi\u00ad\nsion and related language remains consistent with Congress\u2019 initial and\nbasic sentencing intent. . . .

Nor is it\nrelevant that Dillon has no right to be present at a pro\u00ad\nceeding under \u00a73582(c)(2), ante, at 9\u201310, or that a sentence\nreduction proceeding may not be \u201cconstitutionally com\u00ad\npelled,\u201d ante, at 10\u201311. The Court\u2019s general reliance on\nBooker in this case, see ante, at 11\u201312, is odd because the\nBooker Court explained its belief \u201cthat Congress would not\nhave authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a\nnonmandatory system in others,\u201d 543 U. S., at 266. Yet,\nthis is precisely the system the Court approves today.\n  Approaching this case as the Booker Court did, one must\nask whether it is likely that a fully informed Congress\nwould have created this kind of Commission: one endowed\nwith vast responsibilities for drafting advisory Guidelines\nand policy statements, but also with the tiniest sliver of\nlawmaking power to tie the hands of a district court\u2019s\nexercise of grace under \u00a73582(c)(2). I think the answer is\nobvious.\n                            II\n  My understanding of the scope of the Booker remedy is\nreinforced by an additional consideration: The Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s policy statement, to which the Court today allows\nbinding effect, may exceed the scope of the Commission\u2019s\npowers. No one disputes that Congress could have re\u00ad\njected the Court\u2019s remedial holding in Booker if it so\nwished. Instead, it is the Commission that has rejected\nBooker\u2019s application to \u00a73582(c)(2), by purporting to give\nmandatory force to its own policy statement. That action\npresses the bounds of the authority Congress validly gave\nthe Commission in 1984, for it is not clear that Congress\nhas authorized the Commission to create this type of\npolicy statement or to circumvent a decision such as\nBooker on its own accord.\n  We have been quite permissive of congressional delega\u00ad\n12               DILLON v.

We took sanctuary then in the fact\nthat, in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act and creating\nthe Commission, Congress had \u201cse[t] forth more than\nmerely an \u2018intelligible principle\u2019 or minimal standard\u201d for\nthe exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion, and had \u201c \u2018ex\u00ad\nplain[ed] what the Commission should do and how it\nshould do it, and se[t] out specific directives to govern\nparticular situations.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 379.

There was, accordingly, no \u201cconcern of\nencroachment and aggrandizement that has animated our\nseparation-of-powers jurisprudence and aroused our vigi\u00ad\nlance against the \u2018hydraulic pressure inherent within each\nof the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its\npower.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 382 (quoting INS v.

He argued forcefully that\nCongress\u2019 creation of the Commission was itself \u201ca pure\ndelegation of legislative power\u201d and therefore an abuse of\nseparation of powers. 488 U.

That question has now\nreared its head, and in my view it raises separation-of\u00ad\npowers concerns significantly more difficult than those\npresented in Mistretta.\n  First, I am doubtful that Congress authorized the type\nof \u201cpolicy statement\u201d we find in USSG \u00a71B1.10. Congress\ninstructed the Commission to promulgate \u201cgeneral policy\nstatements regarding application of the guidelines or any\nother aspect of sentencing or sentence implementation\nthat in the view of the Commission would further the\npurposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18 . . .\nincluding the appropriate use of,\u201d inter alia, various \u201csen\u00ad\ntence modification provisions.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7994(a)(2). As\nenvisioned by the Sentencing Reform Act, the role of policy\nstatements was merely to inform the judge\u2019s exercise of\n14               DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ndiscretion within an otherwise mandatory Guidelines\nregime. See S. Rep. No. 98\u2013225, p. 167 (1983) (explaining\nthat the \u201csentencing judge is required to take the policy\nstatements into account in deciding what sentence to\nimpose,\u201d but that departure from a policy statement is not\nitself grounds for appeal); see also id., at 166 (identifying\npotential use of policy statement to \u201coffe[r] recommenda\u00ad\ntions as to how\u201d to \u201ctrea[t]\u201d \u201cin the future\u201d \u201cexisting dis\u00ad\nparities which are not adequately cured by the guide\u00ad\nlines\u201d).    Congress reserved binding effect for the\nCommission\u2019s \u201cguidelines,\u201d which the Commission was to\npromulgate pursuant to a distinct statutory provision,\n\u00a7994(a)(1). The Sentencing Reform Act thus drew a basic\ndistinction: Guidelines would bind; policy statements\nwould advise.\n   Given that distinction, it is significant that Congress\nelected to use the Commission\u2019s policy-statement power to\nset limitations on the sentencing modification procedures,\nrather than invoking the Commission\u2019s Guidelines power.\nThe Commission is now trying to use a policy statement to\nhave the mandatory effect of a guideline\u2014inverting the\nSentencing Reform Act\u2019s original design. I find no provi\u00ad\nsion within \u00a7994(a)(2) that would authorize the Commis\u00ad\nsion, via a policy statement, to create a binding Guidelines\nregime. With respect to the type of action the Commission\nhas taken, there is certainly no provision that even ap\u00ad\nproximates the detailed prescriptions on the Commission\u2019s\npower we considered in Mistretta.\n   Moreover, not only does nothing in \u00a7994(a)(2) appear to\nauthorize this type of policy statement, but there is also\nnothing that appears to authorize the Commission, by its\nown fiat, to limit the effect of our decision in Booker.\n   How to respond to Booker, and whether to retain man\u00ad\ndatory Guidelines, was a decision for Congress\u2014and\nCongress alone.

That Congress\nhas declined to disturb Booker in the five years since its\nissuance demonstrates not only that JUSTICE BREYER is\nmore clairvoyant than I am, but also that Congress has\nacquiesced to a discretionary Guidelines regime.

And without such guidance, I fear that,\nin promulgating USSG \u00a71B1.10, the Commission may\nhave made the type of \u201cbasic policy decisio[n]\u201d that\nJUSTICE SCALIA reminded us is the province of the Legis\u00ad\nlature, Mistretta, 488 U.

In other words,\nthe Commission told federal courts that its Guidelines, at\nleast in \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings, remain mandatory and\nbinding.\n  Had the Commission taken it upon itself, by issuance of\na general policy statement, to make its Guidelines manda\u00ad\ntory but subject to jury findings in all cases, we would\neither strike down such an act on separation-of-powers\ngrounds or apply the same remedy we did in Booker to\nrender the statement advisory. It makes little difference,\nin my view, that the Commission has only rejected the\nBooker remedy in this single procedure. The encroach\u00ad\nment is the same, if only more subtle. Any legislative\nresponse to Booker was a decision for Congress to make\u2014\nnot the Commission.\n                              III\n  Separate from the arguments noted above, the Court\u2019s\ndecision today may reflect a concern that a contrary hold\u00ad\ning would discourage the Commission from issuing retro\u00ad\nactive amendments to the Guidelines, owing to a fear of\nburdening the district courts. In what might be described\nas a subtle threat, the Commission has highlighted this\npoint in its amicus brief supporting the Government.

In other\nwords, while Congress has left the retroactivity decision to\nthe Commission\u2019s discretion, it has done so with the pre\u00ad\nsumption that some form of retroactive relief is appropri\u00ad\nate when a Guidelines amendment is nontrivial.8 I cannot\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nments themselves would inevitably discourage the Sentencing Commis\u00ad\nsion from ever authorizing sentence reductions.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 37.\n  8 As the Court notes, I do agree that \u00a7994(u) authorizes the Commis\u00ad\n\nsion to determine the retroactive effect of sentence reductions. Ante, at\n13. I understand \u00a7994(u) as directing the Commission to prescribe the\nretroactive effect, if any, of its Guidelines amendments. The power to\nmake retroactivity determinations is meaningfully different, however,\nfrom the other power the Court claims for the Commission. In granting\nthe former power, Congress has instructed the Commission to perform\na gate keeping function by determining which individuals are eligible\nfor relief pursuant to \u00a73582(c)(2). By contrast, the other power the\nCourt claims for the Commission today is the type of mandatory sen\u00ad\ntencing authority at issue in Booker. Contrary to the Court\u2019s conclu\u00ad\nsion, the Commission after Booker does not have the power to bind the\ndistrict court in setting a particular sentence.\n  I also cannot accept the Court\u2019s broad understanding of the power\nthe Commission derives from \u00a7994(u), see ante, at 8, because it suffers\nfrom the same delegation concerns I discussed above, see supra, 11\u201316.\n18                 DILLON v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\naccept that the Commission would ignore its obligations,\nand would withhold retroactive application of a Guidelines\nreduction, simply because a judge would have discretion\nto enter a below-Guidelines sentence in a \u00a73582(c)(2)\nproceeding.\n   Undoubtedly, discretionary application of the Guidelines\nin \u00a73582(c)(2) proceedings would impose a greater burden\non the district courts. Such a process would require case\u00ad\nspecific evaluations rather than the rote, two-level reduc\u00ad\ntions the Commission envisioned when it made Amend\u00ad\nment 706 retroactive. But it is important to remember\nthat \u00a73582(c)(2) already requires the district court to\nconsider the \u00a73553(a) factors when it determines whether\nto grant a reduction, as well as the extent of the reduction.\nAnd any additional consideration of evidence proffered to\njustify a downward departure need not create a great deal\nof work. Indeed, it need not create any particular adver\u00ad\nsarial process at all: The Commission could simply advise\nthe district courts to review paper submissions, including\nthe original presentence report and objections, as well as\nany new submissions. By now, courts are intimately\nfamiliar with our post-Booker sentencing regime and the\ndiscretionary application of the \u00a73553(a) factors.\n   The facts of Dillon\u2019s case show why any additional bur\u00ad\nden on the courts caused by applying Booker\u2019s remedial\nholding likely pales in comparison to the benefit of achiev\u00ad\ning more tailored, proportionate sentences for those indi\u00ad\nviduals currently serving terms of imprisonment that\nexceed what is \u201cnecessary\u201d to meet the goals of our sen\u00ad\ntencing system, \u00a73553(a). Dillon was 23 years old when he\nwas sentenced to nearly 27 years\u2019 imprisonment for his\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nI do not think the Commission\u2019s authority encompasses the ability to\npromulgate binding Guidelines via policy statements. And this matter\nis separate from its power to promulgate Guidelines\u2014a power unaf\u00ad\nfected by our decision in Booker.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

His attorney urged the District Court to\nenter a below-Guidelines sentence because of, inter alia,\nthe gross disparity between sentences for crack and pow\u00ad\nder cocaine offenses. App. 8\u20139. It would take another 14\nyears for this Court to agree, finally, in Kimbrough, 552\nU. S. 85, that sentencing courts could consider this unjust\ndisparity.\n   But the District Court, constrained by the then\u00ad\nmandatory Guidelines, increased Dillon\u2019s sentence based\non judge-found facts by more than 10 years over the sen\u00ad\ntence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 2, and n. 2. The court could only lament: \u201cI person\u00ad\nally don\u2019t believe that you should be serving 322 months.\nBut I feel I am bound by those Guidelines and I don\u2019t feel\nthere is any grounds for . . . depart[ing] from those Guide\u00ad\nlines.\u201d App. 12\u201313. The court acknowledged: \u201cI don\u2019t say\nto you that these penalties are fair. I don\u2019t think they are\nfair.\u201d Id., at 13. The court also implored Dillon to make\nsomething of the hand he had dealt himself: \u201cI hope that\nwhile you are in prison . . . that you will take some time to\nconsider the direction that your life will take when you do\nreturn to society. . . . It is only through people like you if\nyou spread the word that other young men of your age will\nhesitate to get involved in [dealing drugs].\u201d Ibid.\n   Dillon has done just that. He has participated in out\u00ad\nreach efforts in the communities in which he has been\nimprisoned, doing extensive work with adolescents to steer\nthem away from a life of drugs and crime.

Working with two universities, he has facili\u00ad\ntated the initiation of an African-American Studies pro\u00ad\ngram at Hunters Point Family, a Bay Area organization\ndevoted to assisting at-risk youth. He has also played a\nlarge role in initiating a similar program at his prison\nfacility.

Dillon has also prepared himself for a successful life\nonce he returns to society. He has obtained his general\nequivalency diploma (GED), taken vocational classes in\nproperty management, and has job prospects awaiting him\nupon release. Id., at 6\u20137.\n  The Government concedes that Dillon has undertaken\n\u201csignificant institutional rehabilitation and education.\u201d\nBrief for United States 11. The Court of Appeals acknowl\u00ad\nedged that \u201c[i]f Booker did apply in proceedings pursuant\nto \u00a73582, Dillon would likely be an ideal candidate for a\nnon-Guidelines sentence.\u201d 572 F. 3d 146, 147 (CA3 2009).\nAnd yet, now, the Government will continue to spend more\nthan $25,000 a year to keep Dillon behind bars until his\nrelease date.9\n  Given the circumstances of his case, I can scarcely think\nof a greater waste of this Nation\u2019s precious resources.

Dillon\u2019s continued impris\u00ad\nonment is a truly sad example of what I have come to view\nas an exceptionally, and often mindlessly, harsh federal\npunishment scheme.\n                             IV\n  Neither the interests of justice nor common sense lends\nany support to the decision to preserve the single sliver of\nthe Commission\u2019s lawmaking power that the Court resur\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 See Hanlon, Hecker, & Gopstein, Expanding the Zones: A Modest\n\nProposal to Increase the Use of Alternatives to Incarceration in Federal\nSentencing, 24 ABA Criminal Justice, No. 4, pp. 26, 28 (Winter 2010)\n(\u201cIn fiscal year 2008, it cost $25,894.50 to incarcerate an offender in a\nfederal Bureau of Prisons facility for 12 months\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 560 U.
