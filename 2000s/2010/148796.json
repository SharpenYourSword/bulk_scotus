REILLY\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 08\u2013538.      Argued November 3, 2009\u2014Decided June 17, 2010\nRespondent Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering\n  business failed. She supported her petition with, inter alia, Schedule\n  B, on which debtors must list their assets, and Schedule C, on which\n  they must list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt. Her\n  Schedule B assets included cooking and other kitchen equipment, to\n  which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718. On\n  Schedule C, she claimed two exempt interests in this \u201cbusiness\n  equipment\u201d: a \u201ctool[s] of the trade\u201d exemption for the statutory\n  maximum \u201c$1,850 in value,\u201d 11 U. S. C. \u00a7522(d)(6); and $8,868 under\n  the statutory provisions allowing miscellaneous, or \u201cwildcard,\u201d ex\n  emptions up to $10,225 in value. The claimed exemptions\u2019 total value\n  ($10,718) equaled Reilly\u2019s estimate of the equipment\u2019s market value.\n  Property claimed as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy es\n  tate \u201c[u]nless a party in interest\u201d objects, \u00a7522(l), within a certain 30\n  day period, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b). Absent an objection,\n  the property will be excluded from the estate even if the exemption\u2019s\n  value exceeds what the Code permits. See, e.g., \u00a7522(l); Taylor v.\n  Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642\u2013643.\n    Although an appraisal revealed that the equipment\u2019s total market\n  value could be as much as $17,200, petitioner Schwab, the bank\n  ruptcy estate\u2019s trustee, did not object to the claimed exemptions be\n  cause the dollar value Reilly assigned to each fell within the limits of\n  \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6). Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for per\n  mission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718\n  she claimed exempt and the estate could distribute the remaining\n  value to her creditors. Reilly countered that by equating on Schedule\n  C the total value of her claimed exemptions in the equipment with\n  the equipment\u2019s estimated market value, she had put Schwab and\n2                          SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    her creditors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment\u2019s\n    full value, even if it turned out to be more than the amounts she de\n    clared and that the Code allowed. She asserted that the estate had\n    forfeited its claim to any portion of that value because Schwab had\n    not objected within the Rule 4003(b) period, and that she would dis\n    miss her petition rather than sell her equipment.\n       The Bankruptcy Court denied Schwab\u2019s motion and Reilly\u2019s condi\n    tional motion to dismiss. The District Court denied Schwab relief, re\n    jecting his argument that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires\n    a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the\n    debtor declares as the exemption\u2019s value is within the limits the Code\n    prescribes. Affirming, the Third Circuit agreed that Reilly\u2019s Schedule\n    C entries indicated her intent to exempt the equipment\u2019s full value.\n    Relying on Taylor, it held that Schwab\u2019s failure to object entitled\n    Reilly to exempt the full value of her equipment, even though that\n    value exceeded the amounts that Reilly declared and the Code per\n    mitted.\nHeld: Because Reilly gave \u201cthe value of [her] claimed exemption[s]\u201d on\n Schedule C dollar amounts within the range the Code allows for what\n it defines as the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d Schwab was not re\n quired to object to the exemptions in order to preserve the estate\u2019s\n right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the value of the\n exempt interest. Pp. 6\u201323.\n    (a) Reilly\u2019s complicated view of the trustee\u2019s statutory obligation,\n and her reading of Schedule C, does not accord with the Code. Pp. 6\u2013\n 15.\n      (1) The parties agree that this case is governed by \u00a7522(l), which\n states that a Chapter 7 debtor must \u201cfile a list of property that the\n debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section,\u201d and\n that \u201c[u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as ex\n empt on such list is exempt.\u201d Reilly asserts that the \u201cproperty\n claimed as exempt\u201d refers to all of the information on Schedule C, in\n cluding the estimated market value of each asset. Schwab and\n amicus United States counter that because the Code defines such\n property as an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in a\n particular asset, not as the asset itself, the value of the property\n claimed exempt should be judged on the dollar value the debtor as\n signs the interest, not on the value the debtor assigns the asset.\n Pp. 6\u20139.\n      (2) Schwab and the United States are correct. The portion of\n \u00a7522(l) that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision\n stating that the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is ex\n empt\u201d unless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the portion\n that defines the objection\u2019s target, namely, the \u201clist of property that\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthe debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b).\u201d Section 522(b)\ndoes not define the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d by reference to the\nestimated market value. It refers only to property defined in \u00a7522(d),\nwhich in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim\nas exempt. Most of these categories and all the ones applicable here\ndefine \u201cproperty\u201d as the debtor\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d\u2014up to a specified dollar\namount\u2014in the assets described in the category, not as the assets\nthemselves. Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly\nclaimed as exempt because its stated value was within the limits the\nCode allows. Reilly\u2019s contrary view does not withstand scrutiny be\ncause it defines the target of a trustee\u2019s objection based on Schedule\nC\u2019s language and dictionary definitions of \u201cproperty\u201d at odds with the\nCode\u2019s definition. The Third Circuit failed to account for the Code\u2019s\ndefinition and for provisions that permit debtors to exempt certain\nproperty in kind or in full regardless of value. See, e.g., \u00a7522(d)(9).\nSchwab was entitled to evaluate the claimed exemptions\u2019 propriety\nbased on three Schedule C entries: the description of the business\nequipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code\nprovisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly\nlisted in the column titled \u201cvalue of claimed exemption.\u201d This conclu\nsion does not render Reilly\u2019s market value estimate superfluous. It\nsimply confines that estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in\nadministering the estate by helping him identify assets that may\nhave value beyond the amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose\nfull value may not be available for exemption. This interpretation is\nconsistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions.\nPp. 9\u201315.\n   (b) Taylor does not dictate a contrary conclusion. While both Tay\nlor and this case concern the consequences of a trustee\u2019s failure to ob\nject to a claimed exemption within Rule 4003\u2019s time period, Taylor es\ntablishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an\ninterested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount\nthe debtor lists as the \u201cvalue claimed exempt\u201d is not within statutory\nlimits. In Taylor, the value listed in Schedule C (\u201c$ unknown\u201d) was\nnot plainly within those limits, but here, the values ($8,868 and\n$1,850) are within Code limits and thus do not raise the warning flag\npresent in Taylor. Departing from Taylor would not only ignore the\npresumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law;\nit would also require the Court to expand the statutory definition of\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d and the universe of information an in\nterested party must consider in evaluating an exemption\u2019s validity.\nEven if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised.\nBasing the definition of \u201cproperty claimed exempt,\u201d and thus an in\nterested party\u2019s obligation to object under \u00a7522(l), on inferences that\n4                           SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    party must draw from preprinted bankruptcy schedules that evolve\n    over time, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor\n    assigns the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as defined by the Code,\n    would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to pro\n    vide. Pp. 16\u201318.\n      (c) Reilly\u2019s argument threatens to convert the Code\u2019s goal of giving\n    debtors a fresh start into a free pass. By permitting a debtor \u201cto\n    withdraw from the estate certain interests in property, . . . up to cer\n    tain values,\u201d Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325, Congress bal\n    anced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors\n    with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors. This\n    Court should not alter that balance by requiring trustees to object to\n    claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those governing an\n    exemption\u2019s validity under the Code. In rejecting Reilly\u2019s approach,\n    the Court does not create incentives for trustees and creditors to\n    sleep on their rights. The decision reached here encourages a debtor\n    wishing to exempt an asset\u2019s full market value or the asset itself to\n    declare the value of the claimed exemption in a way that makes its\n    scope clear. Such declarations will encourage the trustee to object\n    promptly and preserve for the estate any value in the asset beyond\n    relevant statutory limits. If the trustee fails to object, or his objection\n    is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the asset\u2019s full\n    value. If the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either\n    to forfeit the portion of the exemption exceeding the statutory allow\n    ance or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with creditors to\n    permit the exemption. See Rule 1009(a). Either result will facilitate\n    the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the\n    debtor and creditors to achieve a fresh start free of Reilly\u2019s finality\n    and clouded-title concerns.

NADEJDA\n\n                   REILLY \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 17, 2010] \n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  When a debtor files a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, all\nof the debtor\u2019s assets become property of the bankruptcy\nestate, see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7541, subject to the debtor\u2019s right to\nreclaim certain property as \u201cexempt,\u201d \u00a7522(l). The Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Code specifies the types of property debtors may\nexempt, \u00a7522(b), as well as the maximum value of the\nexemptions a debtor may claim in certain assets, \u00a7522(d).\nProperty a debtor claims as exempt will be excluded from\nthe bankruptcy estate \u201c[u]nless a party in interest\u201d ob\u00ad\njects. \u00a7522(l).\n  This case presents an opportunity for us to resolve a\ndisagreement among the Courts of Appeals about what\nconstitutes a claim of exemption to which an interested\nparty must object under \u00a7522(l). The issue is whether an\ninterested party must object to a claimed exemption\nwhere, as here, the Code defines the property the debtor is\nauthorized to exempt as an interest, the value of which\nmay not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular\ntype of asset, and the debtor\u2019s schedule of exempt property\naccurately describes the asset and declares the \u201cvalue of\n2                            SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n[the] claimed exemption\u201d in that asset to be an amount\nwithin the limits that the Code prescribes. Fed. Rule\nBkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Schedule C (1991) (hereinaf\u00ad\nter Schedule C). We hold that, in cases such as this, an\ninterested party need not object to an exemption claimed\nin this manner in order to preserve the estate\u2019s ability to\nrecover value in the asset beyond the dollar value the\ndebtor expressly declared exempt.\n                              I\n   Respondent Nadejda Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bank\u00ad\nruptcy when her catering business failed. She supported\nher petition with various schedules and statements, two of\nwhich are relevant here: Schedule B, on which the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Rules require debtors to list their assets (most of\nwhich become property of the estate), and Schedule C, on\nwhich the Rules require debtors to list the property they\nwish to reclaim as exempt. The assets Reilly listed on\nSchedule B included an itemized list of cooking and other\nkitchen equipment that she described as \u201cbusiness equip\u00ad\nment,\u201d and to which she assigned an estimated market\nvalue of $10,718. App. 40a, 49a\u201355a.\n   On Schedule C, Reilly claimed two exempt interests in\nthis equipment pursuant to different sections of the Code.\nReilly claimed a \u201ctool[s] of the trade\u201d exemption of $1,850\nin the equipment under \u00a7522(d)(6), which permits a debtor\nto exempt his \u201caggregate interest, not to exceed $1,850 in\nvalue, in any implements, professional books, or tools, of\n[his] trade.\u201d See also 69 Fed. Reg. 8482 (2004) (Table).\nAnd she claimed a miscellaneous exemption of $8,868 in\nthe equipment under \u00a7522(d)(5), which, at the time she\nfiled for bankruptcy, permitted a debtor to take a \u201cwild\u00ad\ncard\u201d exemption equal to the \u201cdebtor\u2019s aggregate interest\nin any property, not to exceed\u201d $10,225 \u201cin value.\u201d1 See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The   1994 version of 11 U.

The total value of these claimed exemptions\n($10,718) equaled the value Reilly separately listed on\nSchedules B and C as the equipment\u2019s estimated market\nvalue, see id., at 49a, 58a.\n   Subject to exceptions not relevant here, the Federal\nRules of Bankruptcy Procedure require interested parties\nto object to a debtor\u2019s claimed exemptions within 30 days\nafter the conclusion of the creditors\u2019 meeting held pursu\u00ad\nant to Rule 2003(a). See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b).\nIf an interested party fails to object within the time al\u00ad\nlowed, a claimed exemption will exclude the subject prop\u00ad\nerty from the estate even if the exemption\u2019s value exceeds\nwhat the Code permits. See, e.g., \u00a7522(l); Taylor v. Free\nland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642\u2013643 (1992).\n   Petitioner William G. Schwab, the trustee of Reilly\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate, did not object to Reilly\u2019s claimed ex\u00ad\nemptions in her business equipment because the dollar\nvalue Reilly assigned each exemption fell within the limits\nthat \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6) prescribe. App. 163a. But be\u00ad\ncause an appraisal revealed that the total market value of\nReilly\u2019s business equipment could be as much as $17,200,2\nSchwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to\nauction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718\nshe claimed as exempt, and the estate could distribute the\nequipment\u2019s remaining value (approximately $6,500) to\nReilly\u2019s creditors.

See 69 Fed. Reg. 8482\n(Table). In 2007 and 2010 the limits were again increased. See 72 id.,\nat 7082 (Table); 75 id., at 8748 (Table).\n  2 Schwab concedes that the appraisal occurred before Rule 4003(b)\u2019s\n\n30-day window for objecting to the claimed exemptions had passed. See\nBrief for Petitioner 15.\n4                         SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Reilly opposed Schwab\u2019s motion. She argued that by\nequating on Schedule C the total value of the exemptions\nshe claimed in the equipment with the equipment\u2019s esti\u00ad\nmated market value, she had put Schwab and her credi\u00ad\ntors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment\u2019s\nfull value, even if that amount turned out to be more than\nthe dollar amount she declared, and more than the Code\nallowed. Id., at 165a. Citing \u00a7522(l), Reilly asserted that\nbecause her Schedule C notified Schwab of her intent to\nexempt the full value of her business equipment, he was\nobliged to object if he wished to preserve the estate\u2019s right\nto retain any value in the equipment in excess of the\n$10,718 she estimated. Because Schwab did not object\nwithin the time prescribed by Rule 4003(b), Reilly asserted\nthat the estate forfeited its claim to such value. Id., at\n165a. Reilly further informed the Bankruptcy Court that\nexempting her business equipment from the estate was so\nimportant to her that she would dismiss her bankruptcy\ncase if doing so was the only way to avoid the equipment\u2019s\nsale at auction.3\n  The Bankruptcy Court denied both Schwab\u2019s motion to\nauction the equipment and Reilly\u2019s conditional motion to\ndismiss her case. See In re Reilly, 403 B. R. 336 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. MD Pa. 2006). Schwab sought relief from the District\nCourt, arguing that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b)\nrequires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where\nthe amount the debtor declares as the \u201cvalue of [the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Reilly\u2019s desire to avoid the equipment\u2019s auction is understandable\n\nbecause the equipment, which Reilly\u2019s parents purchased for her\ndespite their own financial difficulties, has \u201c \u2018extraordinary sentimental\nvalue.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 5 (quoting App. 152a\u2013153a). But the\nsentimental value of the property cannot drive our decision in this case,\nbecause sentimental value is not a basis for construing the Bankruptcy\nCode. Because the Code imposes limits on exemptions, many debtors\nwho seek to take advantage of the Code are, no doubt, put to the\nsimilarly difficult choice of parting with property of \u201cextraordinary\nsentimental value.\u201d Id., at 152a\u2212153a; see infra, at 19\u201323.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

See In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173 (CA3\n2008).\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with the Bankruptcy Court\nthat by equating on Schedule C the total value of her\nexemptions in her business equipment with the equip\u00ad\nment\u2019s market value, Reilly \u201cindicate[d] the intent\u201d to\nexempt the equipment\u2019s full value. Id., at 174. In reach\u00ad\ning this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our\ndecision in Taylor:\n    \u201c[W]e believe this case to be controlled by Taylor.\n    Just as we perceive it was important to the Taylor\n    Court that the debtor meant to exempt the full\n    amount of the property by listing \u2018unknown\u2019 as both\n    the value of the property and the value of the exemp\u00ad\n    tion, it is important to us that Reilly valued the busi\u00ad\n    ness equipment at $10,718 and claimed an exemption\n    in the same amount. Such an identical listing put\n    Schwab on notice that Reilly intended to exempt the\n    property fully.\n          .          .          .           .          .\n    \u201c \u2018[A]n unstated premise\u2019 of Taylor was \u2018that a debtor\n    who exempts the entire reported value of an asset is\n    claiming the \u201cfull amount,\u201d whatever it turns out to\n    be.\u2019 \u201d 534 F. 3d, at 178\u2212179.\nRelying on this \u201cunstated premise,\u201d the Court of Appeals\nheld that Schwab\u2019s failure to object to Reilly\u2019s claimed\nexemptions entitled Reilly to the equivalent of an in-kind\ninterest in her business equipment, even though the value\nof that exemption exceeded the amount that Reilly de\u00ad\nclared on Schedule C and the amount that the Code al\u00ad\nlowed her to withdraw from the bankruptcy estate. Ibid.\n  As noted, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision adds to dis\u00ad\n6                         SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nagreement among the Circuits about what constitutes a\nclaim of exemption to which an interested party must\nobject under \u00a7522(l).4 We granted certiorari to resolve this\nconflict. See 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We conclude that the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 approach fails to account for the text of\nthe relevant Code provisions and misinterprets our deci\u00ad\nsion in Taylor. Accordingly, we reverse.\n                             II\n   The starting point for our analysis is the proper inter\u00ad\npretation of Reilly\u2019s Schedule C. If we read the Schedule\nReilly\u2019s way, she claimed exemptions in her business\nequipment that could exceed statutory limits, and thus\nclaimed exemptions to which Schwab should have objected\nif he wished to enforce those limits for the benefit of the\nestate. If we read Schedule C Schwab\u2019s way, Reilly\nclaimed valid exemptions to which Schwab had no duty to\nobject. The Court of Appeals construed Schedule C Reil\u00ad\nly\u2019s way and interpreted her claimed exemptions as im\u00ad\nproper, and therefore objectionable, even though their\ndeclared value was facially within the applicable Code\nlimits. In so doing, the Court of Appeals held that trustees\nevaluating the validity of exemptions in cases like this\ncannot take a debtor\u2019s claim at face value, and specifically\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 CompareIn re Williams, 104 F. 3d 688, 690 (CA4 1997) (holding\nthat interested parties have no duty to object to a claimed exemption\nwhere the dollar amount the debtor assigns the exemption is facially\nwithin the range the Code allows for the type of property in issue); In re\nWick, 276 F. 3d 412 (CA8 2002) (employing reasoning similar to Wil\nliams, but stopping short of articulating a clear rule), with In re Green,\n31 F. 3d 1098, 1100 (CA11 1994) (\u201cA debtor who exempts the entire\nreported value of an asset is claiming the [asset\u2019s] \u2018full amount,\u2019 what\u00ad\never it turns out to be\u201d); In re Anderson, 377 B. R. 865 (Bkrtcy. App.\nPanel CA6 2007) (similar); and In re Barroso-Herrans, 524 F. 3d 341,\n344 (CA1 2008) (focusing on \u201chow a reasonable trustee would have\nunderstood the filings under the circumstances\u201d); In re Hyman, 967\nF. 2d 1316 (CA9 1992) (applying an analogous totality-of-the\u00ad\ncircumstances approach).\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncannot rely on the fact that the amount the debtor de\u00ad\nclares as the \u201cvalue of [the] claimed exemption\u201d is within\nstatutory limits. Instead, the trustee\u2019s duty to object turns\non whether the interplay of various schedule entries sup\u00ad\nports an inference that the debtor \u201cintended\u201d to exempt a\ndollar value different than the one she wrote on the form.\n534 F. 3d, at 178. This complicated view of the trustee\u2019s\nstatutory obligation, and the strained reading of Schedule\nC on which it rests, is inconsistent with the Code.5\n   The parties agree that this case is governed by \u00a7522(l),\nwhich states that a Chapter 7 debtor must \u201cfile a list of\nproperty that the debtor claims as exempt under subsec\u00ad\ntion (b) of this section,\u201d and further states that \u201c[u]nless a\nparty in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt\non such list is exempt.\u201d The parties further agree that the\n\u201clist\u201d to which \u00a7522(l) refers is the \u201clist of property . . .\nclaim[ed] as exempt\u201d currently known as \u201cSchedule C.\u201d\nSee Schedule C.6 The parties, like the Courts of Appeals,\ndisagree about what information on Schedule C defines\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d for purposes of evaluat\u00ad\ning an exemption\u2019s propriety under \u00a7522(l). Reilly asserts\nthat the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d is defined by refer\u00ad\nence to all the information on Schedule C, including the\nestimated market value of each asset in which the debtor\nclaims an exempt interest. Schwab and the United States\nas amicus curiae argue that the Code specifically defines\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as an interest, the value\nof which may not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a\nparticular asset, not as the asset itself. Accordingly, they\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The forms, rules, treatise excerpts, and policy considerations on\n\nwhich the dissent relies, see post, at 4\u221216, must be read in light of the\nBankruptcy Code provisions that govern this case, and must yield to\nthose provisions in the event of conflict.\n  6 Bankruptcy Rule 4003 specifies the time within which the debtor\n\nmust file Schedule C, as well as the time within which interested\nparties must object to the exemptions claimed thereon.\n8                            SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\nargue that the value of the property claimed exempt, i.e.,\nthe value of the debtor\u2019s exempt interest in the asset,\nshould be judged on the value the debtor assigns the\ninterest, not on the value the debtor assigns the asset.\nThe point of disagreement is best illustrated by the rele\u00ad\nvant portion of Reilly\u2019s Schedule C:\n             Schedule C\u2500Property Claimed as Exempt\nDescription of     Specify Law      Value of        Current Market Value\nProperty           Providing Each   Claimed         of Property Without\n                   Exemption        Exemption       Deducting Exemptions\nSchedule B\nPersonal\nProperty\n....               ....             ....            ....\n\nSee attached       11 U.

C.      8,868\n                   \u00a7522(d)(5)\n\nAccording to Reilly, Schwab was required to treat the\nestimate of market value she entered in column four as\npart of her claimed exemption in identifying the \u201cproperty\nclaimed as exempt\u201d under \u00a7522(l). See Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndent 22\u201328. Relying on this premise, Reilly argues that\nwhere, as here, a debtor equates the total value of her\nclaimed exemptions in a certain asset (column three) with\nher estimate of the asset\u2019s market value (column four), she\nestablishes the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as the full\nvalue of the asset, whatever that turns out to be. See ibid.\nAccordingly, Reilly argues that her Schedule C clearly put\nSchwab on notice that she \u201cintended\u201d to claim an exemp\u00ad\ntion for the full value of her business equipment, and that\nSchwab\u2019s failure to oppose the exemption in a timely\nmanner placed the full value of the equipment outside the\nestate\u2019s reach.\n   Schwab does not dispute that columns three and four\napprised him that Reilly equated the total value of her\nclaimed exemptions in the equipment ($1,850 plus $8,868)\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the equipment\u2019s market value ($10,718). He simply\ndisagrees with Reilly that this \u201cidentical listing put [him]\non notice that Reilly intended to exempt the property\nfully,\u201d regardless whether its value exceeded the exemp\u00ad\ntion limits the Code prescribes. 534 F. 3d, at 178. Schwab\nand amicus United States instead contend that the Code\ndefines the \u201cproperty\u201d Reilly claimed as exempt under\n\u00a7522(l) as an \u201cinterest\u201d whose value cannot exceed a cer\u00ad\ntain dollar amount. Brief for Petitioner 20\u201326; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 3\u20136; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 12\u201318. Construing Reilly\u2019s Schedule C in light of\nthis statutory definition, they contend that Reilly\u2019s\nclaimed exemption was facially unobjectionable because\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (i.e., two interests in her\nbusiness equipment worth $8,868 and $1,850, respec\u00ad\ntively) is property Reilly was clearly entitled to exclude\nfrom her estate under the Code provisions she referenced\nin column 2. See supra, at 8 (citing \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6)).\nAccordingly, Schwab and the United States conclude that\nSchwab had no obligation to object to the exemption in\norder to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly\u2019s busi\u00ad\nness equipment beyond the total amount ($10,718) Reilly\nproperly claimed as exempt.\n   We agree. The portion of \u00a7522(l) that resolves this case\nis not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt\u201d\nunless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the por\u00ad\ntion of \u00a7522(l) that defines the target of the objection,\nnamely, the portion that says Schwab has a duty to object\nto the \u201clist of property that the debtor claims as exempt\nunder subsection (b).\u201d (Emphasis added.) That subsec\u00ad\ntion, \u00a7522(b), does not define the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt\u201d by reference to the estimated market value on\nwhich Reilly and the Court of Appeals rely. Brief for\nRespondent 22\u201323; 534 F. 3d, at 178. Section 522(b)\nrefers only to property defined in \u00a7522(d), which in turn\n10                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as\nexempt. As we have recognized, most of these categories\n(and all of the categories applicable to Reilly\u2019s exemptions)\ndefine the \u201cproperty\u201d a debtor may \u201cclai[m] as exempt\u201d as\nthe debtor\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d\u2014up to a specified dollar amount\u2014\nin the assets described in the category, not as the assets\nthemselves. \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5)\u2013(6); see also \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(1)\u2013(4), (8);\nRousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005); Owen v.\nOwen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). Viewing Reilly\u2019s form\nentries in light of this definition, we agree with Schwab\nand the United States that Schwab had no duty to object\nto the property Reilly claimed as exempt (two interests in\nher business equipment worth $1,850 and $8,868) because\nthe stated value of each interest, and thus of the \u201cprop\u00ad\nerty claimed as exempt,\u201d was within the limits the Code\nallows.7\n   Reilly\u2019s contrary view of Schwab\u2019s obligations under\n\u00a7522(l) does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the\ntarget of a trustee\u2019s objection\u2014the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt\u201d\u2014based on language in Schedule C and dictionary\ndefinitions of \u201cproperty,\u201d see Brief for Respondent 24\u201325,\n40\u201341, that the definition in the Code itself overrides.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Schwab\u2019s statutory duty to object to the exemptions in this case\n\nturns solely on whether the value of the property claimed as exempt\nexceeds statutory limits because the parties agree that Schwab had no\ncause to object to Reilly\u2019s attempt to claim exemptions in the equipment\nat issue, or to the applicability of the Code provisions Reilly cited in\nsupport of her exemptions.\n  8 The dissent\u2019s approach suffers from a similar flaw, and misstates\n\nour holding in critiquing it. See post, at 1\u22122 (asserting that by refusing\nto subject \u201cchallenges to the debtor\u2019s valuation of exemptible assets\u201d to\nthe \u201c30-day\u201d objection period in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure\n4003(b), we \u201cdrastically reduc[e] Rule 4003\u2019s governance\u201d).

Challenges to\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as defined by the Code are covered by\nRule 4003(b), but in this case that property is not objectionable, so the\nlack of an objection did not violate the Rule.

S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAlthough we may look to dictionaries and the Bankruptcy\nRules to determine the meaning of words the Code does\nnot define, see, e.g., Rousey, supra, at 330, the Code\u2019s\ndefinition of the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d in this case\nis clear. As noted above, \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6) define the\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as an \u201cinterest\u201d in Reilly\u2019s\nbusiness equipment, not as the equipment per se. Sections\n522(d)(5) and (6) further and plainly state that claims to\nexempt such interests are statutorily permissible, and\nthus unobjectionable, if the value of the claimed interest is\nbelow a particular dollar amount.9 That is the case here,\nand Schwab was entitled to rely upon these provisions in\nevaluating whether Reilly\u2019s exemptions were objectionable\nunder the Code. See Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540\nU. S. 526, 534 (2004); Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v.\nUnion Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000). The\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 contrary holding not only fails to account\nfor the Code\u2019s definition of the \u201cproperty claimed as ex\u00ad\nempt.\u201d It also fails to account for the provisions in \u00a7522(d)\nthat permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or\nin full regardless of value. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(9) (profes\u00ad\nsionally prescribed health aids), (10)(C) (disability bene\u00ad\nfits), (7) (unmatured life insurance contracts). We decline\nto construe Reilly\u2019s claimed exemptions in a manner that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthis point. Accordingly, our holding does not \u201creduc[e] Rule 4003\u2019s\ngovernance,\u201d nor does it express any judgment on what constrains\nobjections to the type of \u201cmarket value\u201d estimates, post, at 1, the\ndissent equates with the dollar value a debtor assigns the \u201cproperty\nclaimed as exempt\u201d as defined by the Code, see, e.g., post, at 2, 6.\n   9 Treating such claims as unobjectionable is consistent with our pre\u00ad\n\ncedents. See, e.g., Rousey, 544 U. S., at 325. It also accords with\nbankruptcy court decisions holding that where, as here, a debtor claims\nan exemption pursuant to provisions that (like \u00a7522(d)(6)) permit the\ndebtor to exclude from the estate only an \u201cinterest\u201d in certain property,\nthe \u201cproperty\u201d that becomes exempt absent objection, \u00a7522(l), is only\nthe \u201cpartial interest\u201d claimed as exempt and not \u201cthe asset as a whole,\u201d\ne.g., In re Soost, 262 B. R. 68, 72 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA8 2001).\n12                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nelides the distinction between these provisions and provi\u00ad\nsions such as \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6), see, e.g., Duncan v.\nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001), particularly based upon\nan entry on Schedule C\u2014Reilly\u2019s estimate of her equip\u00ad\nment\u2019s market value\u2014to which the Code does not refer in\ndefining the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt.\u201d10\n   For all of these reasons, we conclude that Schwab was\nentitled to evaluate the propriety of the claimed exemp\u00ad\ntions based on three, and only three, entries on Reilly\u2019s\nSchedule C: the description of the business equipment in\nwhich Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent\u2019s approach does not avoid these concerns. The dissent\n\ninsists that \u201ca debtor\u2019s market valuation [of the equipment in which she\nclaims an exempt interest] is an essential factor in determining the\nnature of the \u2018interest\u2019 [the] debtor lists as exempt\u201d (and thus in deter\u00ad\nmining whether the claimed exemption is objectionable), because\n\u201cwithout comparing [the debtor\u2019s] market valuation of the equipment to\nthe value of her claimed exemption\u201d the trustee \u201ccould not comprehend\nwhether [the debtor] claimed a monetary or an in-kind \u2018interest\u2019 in [the]\nequipment.\u201d Post, at 9, n. 9. This argument overlooks the fact that\nthere is another way the trustee could discern from the \u201cface of the\ndebtor\u2019s filings,\u201d post, at 7, n. 6, whether the debtor claimed as exempt\na \u201cmonetary or an in-kind \u2018interest\u2019 in\u201d her equipment, post, at 9, n. 9:\nThe trustee could simply consult the Code provisions the debtor listed\nas governing the exemption in question. Here, those provisions,\n\u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (d)(6), expressly describe the exempt interest as an\n\u201cinterest\u201d \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a specified dollar amount. Accordingly, it was\nentirely appropriate for Schwab to view Reilly\u2019s schedule entries as\nexempting an interest in her business equipment in the (declared and\nunobjectionable) amounts of $1,850 and $8,868. Viewing the entries\notherwise, i.e., as exempting the equipment in kind or in full no matter\nwhat its dollar value, would unnecessarily treat the exemption as\nviolating the limits imposed by the Code provisions that govern it, as\nwell as ignore the distinction between those provisions and the provi\u00ad\nsions that \u201cauthoriz[e] reclamation of the property in full without any\ncap on value,\u201d post, at 7, n. 5. And it would do all of this based on\ninformation (identical dollar amounts in columns three and four of\nSchedule C) that Schwab and one of his amici say often result from a\ndefault setting in commercial bankruptcy software.

As\nnoted, most assets become property of the estate upon\ncommencement of a bankruptcy case, see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7541,\nand exemptions represent the debtor\u2019s attempt to reclaim\nthose assets or, more often, certain interests in those\nassets, to the creditors\u2019 detriment. Accordingly, it is at\nleast useful for a trustee to be able to compare the value of\nthe claimed exemption (which typically represents the\ndebtor\u2019s interest in a particular asset) with the asset\u2019s\nestimated market value (which belongs to the estate sub\u00ad\nject to any valid exemption) without having to consult\nseparate schedules.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The  dissent\u2019s argument that the estimate plays a greater role, and\nis \u201cvital,\u201d post, at 8, to determining whether the value a debtor assigns\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (here, an interest in certain business\nequipment) is objectionable, see post, at 8\u22129, lacks statutory support\nbecause the governing Code provisions phrase the exemption limit as a\nsimple dollar amount. The dissent\u2019s view, see post, at 7\u22129, might be\nplausible if the Code stated that the debtor could exempt an interest in\nher equipment \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a certain percentage of the equipment\u2019s\n14                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Our interpretation of Schwab\u2019s statutory obligations is\nnot only consistent with the governing Code provisions; it\nis also consistent with the historical treatment of bank\u00ad\nruptcy exemptions. Congress has permitted debtors to\nexempt certain property from their bankruptcy estates for\nmore than two centuries. See Act of Apr. 4, 1800, ch. 19,\n\u00a75, 2 Stat. 23.12 Throughout these periods, debtors have\nvalidly exempted property based on forms that required\nthe debtor to list the value of a claimed exemption without\nalso estimating the market value of the asset in which the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmarket value, because then it might be necessary to \u201ccompar[e] [the\ndebtor\u2019s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed\nexemption\u201d to determine the exemption\u2019s propriety. Post, at 9, n. 9.\nBut the Code does not phrase the exemption cap in such terms. More\u00ad\nover, even accepting that the equivalent Schedule C entries the dissent\nrelies upon represent a claim to exempt an asset\u2019s full value, the\ndissent does not explain why this equivalence precludes a trustee from\nrelying on the dollar amount the debtor expressly assigns both entries.\nAccording to the dissent, a trustee faced with such entries should\nassume not only that the debtor reclaims from the estate what she\nbelieves to be the full value of an asset in which the Code allows her to\nexempt an interest \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a certain dollar amount, e.g.,\n\u00a7522(d)(6), but also that the debtor would continue to claim the asset\u2019s\nfull value as exempt even if that value exceeds her estimate to a point\nthat would cause her claim to violate the Code. The schedule entries\nthemselves do not compel this assumption, and the Code provisions\nthey invoke undercut it. The evidence that the debtor in this case\nwould have chosen that course is external to her exemption schedule.\nSee, e.g., supra, at 4 (citing statements in Reilly\u2019s motion to dismiss);\npost, at 4, n. 3, 6 (same). And in the ordinary case, particularly if the\nequivalent entries the dissent relies upon result from a software de\u00ad\nfault, see n. 10, supra, there is no reason to assume that a debtor would\nwant to violate the Code or jeopardize other exemptions if her market\nvalue estimate turns out to be wrong.\n  12 See also Act of Aug. 19, 1841, ch. 9, \u00a73, 5 Stat. 442; Act of Mar. 2,\n\n1867, ch. 176, \u00a711, 14 Stat. 521, amended by Act of June 22, 1874, 18\nStat., Pt. 3, p. 182; Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, \u00a76, 30 Stat.\n548, 11 U.

This amendment was not occasioned by\nlegislative changes that altered the Code\u2019s definition of\n\u201cthe property claimed as exempt\u201d in this case as an \u201cinter\u00ad\nest,\u201d not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in Reilly\u2019s\nbusiness equipment.14 Accordingly, we agree with Schwab\nand the United States that this recent amendment to the\nexemption form does not compel Reilly\u2019s view of Schwab\u2019s\nstatutory obligations, or render the claimed exemptions in\nthis case objectionable under the Code.

See Communica\u00ad\n\ntion from THE CHIEF JUSTICE of the United States Transmitting\nAmendments to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure Prescribed\nby the Court, Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 2075, H. R. Doc. 102\u201380, p. 558,\nreprinted in 11 Bankruptcy Rules Documentary History (1990\u20131991)\n(referencing only the fact of the amendment). It may have been to\nconsolidate and reconcile the separate forms debtors were previously\nrequired to file in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases, see, e.g., In re\nBeshirs, 236 B. R. 42, 46\u221247 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 1999), or simply to make\nit easier for trustees to evaluate whether certain assets were viable\ncandidates for liquidation. Whatever the case, it did not result from\nstatutory changes to the Code provisions that govern this dispute.\n   15 Because the Code provisions we rely upon to resolve this case do\n\nnot obligate trustees to object under Rule 4003(b) to a debtor\u2019s estimate\nof the market value of an asset in which the debtor claims an exempt\ninterest, our analysis does not depend on whether the schedule of\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (currently Schedule C) calls for such an\nestimate or not. We engage the point only because Reilly suggests that\nthe 1991 schedule revisions requiring debtors to provide such an\nestimate on the schedule of \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d means that\n16                        SCHWAB v.

See 534 F. 3d, at\n178. Taylor does not rest on what the debtor \u201cmeant\u201d to\nexempt. 534 F. 3d, at 178. Rather, Taylor applies to the\nface of a debtor\u2019s claimed exemption the Code provisions\nthat compel reversal here.\n  The debtor in Taylor, like the debtor here, filed a sched\u00ad\nule of exemptions with the Bankruptcy Court on which the\ndebtor described the property subject to the claimed ex\u00ad\nemption, identified the Code provision supporting the\nexemption, and listed the dollar value of the exemption.\nCritically, however, the debtor in Taylor did not, like the\ndebtor here, state the value of the claimed exemption as a\nspecific dollar amount at or below the limits the Code\nallows. Instead, the debtor in Taylor listed the value of\nthe exemption itself as \u201c$ unknown\u201d:\n           Schedule B-4. \u2500Property Claimed Exempt\nType of         Location, Description,     Specify the     Value Claimed\nProperty        and, So Far As Relevant    Statute         Exempt\n                to the Claim of Exemp\u00ad     Creating the\n                tion, Present Use of       Exemption\n                Property\nProceeds from   Winn v.

See Brief for Respondent 40\u221241. The dissent\nranges far beyond even this unavailing argument in suggesting that the\nmarket value estimate served as \u201can essential factor in determining the\nnature of the \u2018interest\u2019 a debtor lists as exempt,\u201d post, at 9, n. 9, even\nbefore 1991 when that estimate did not appear on the schedule of\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (former Schedule B\u22124), but rather ap\u00ad\npeared on former \u201cSchedule B\u20132,\u201d post, at 7, n. 6, which merely listed\nthe debtor\u2019s \u201cpersonal property\u201d as of the date of the petition filing.\nInterim Fed.

S. ____ (2010)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrendered the debtor\u2019s claimed exemption objectionable on\nits face because the exemption concerned an asset (lawsuit\nproceeds) that the Code did not permit the debtor to ex\u00ad\nempt beyond a specific dollar amount. See 503 U. S., at\n642. Accordingly, although this case and Taylor both\nconcern the consequences of a trustee\u2019s failure to object to\na claimed exemption within the time specified by Rule\n4003, the question arose in Taylor on starkly different\nfacts. In Taylor, the question concerned a trustee\u2019s obliga\u00ad\ntion to object to the debtor\u2019s entry of a \u201cvalue claimed\nexempt\u201d that was not plainly within the limits the Code\nallows. In this case, the opposite is true. The amounts\nReilly listed in the Schedule C column titled \u201cValue of\nClaimed Exemption\u201d are facially within the limits the\nCode prescribes and raise no warning flags that warranted\nan objection.16 See supra, at 8.\n   Taylor supports this conclusion. In holding otherwise,\nthe Court of Appeals focused on what it described as Tay\nlor\u2019s \u201c \u2018unstated premise\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018a debtor who exempts the\nentire reported value of an asset is claiming the \u201cfull\namount,\u201d whatever it turns out to be.\u2019 \u201d 534 F. 3d, at 179.\nBut Taylor does not rest on this premise. It establishes\nand applies the straightforward proposition that an inter\u00ad\nested party must object to a claimed exemption if the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 See, e.g., Barroso-Herrans, 524 F. 3d, at 345 (explaining that Sche\u00ad\n\ndule C entries listing the value of a claimed exemption as \u201cunknown,\u201d\n\u201cto be determined,\u201d or \u201c100%\u201d are \u201c \u2018red flags to trustees and creditors,\u2019\nand therefore put them on notice that if they do not object, the whole\nvalue of the asset\u2014whatever it might later turn out to be\u2014will be\nexempt\u201d (quoting 1 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b68.06[1][c][ii] (15th ed. rev.\n2007); citation and some internal quotation marks omitted)). The\ndissent concedes that a debtor\u2019s exemption schedule \u201cmust give notice\nsufficient to cue the trustee that an objection may be in order,\u201d and\nrightly observes that the sufficiency of a particular cue, or \u201c \u2018 warning\nflag,\u2019 \u201d may lie \u201cin the eye of the beholder.\u201d Post, at 14. In this case,\nhowever, the Code itself breaks the tie between what might otherwise\nbe two equally tenable views.\n18                      SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\namount the debtor lists as the \u201cvalue claimed exempt\u201d is\nnot within statutory limits, a test the value ($ unknown)\nin Taylor failed, and the values ($8,868 and $1,850) in this\ncase pass.\n   We adhere to this test. Doing otherwise would not only\ndepart from Taylor and ignore the presumption that par\u00ad\nties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law, cf. United\nStates v. Budd, 144 U. S. 154, 163 (1892); it would also\nrequire us to expand the statutory definition of \u201cproperty\nclaimed as exempt\u201d and the universe of information an\ninterested party must consider in evaluating the validity\nof a claimed exemption. Even if the Code allowed such\nexpansions, they would be ill advised. As evidenced by the\ndifferences between Reilly\u2019s Schedule C and the schedule\nin Taylor, preprinted bankruptcy schedules change over\ntime. Basing the definition of the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt,\u201d and thus an interested party\u2019s obligation to\nobject under \u00a7522(l), on inferences that party must draw\nfrom evolving forms, rather than on the facial validity of\nthe value the debtor assigns the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt\u201d as defined by the Code, would undermine the\npredictability the statute is designed to provide.17 For all\nof these reasons, we take Reilly\u2019s exemptions at face value\nand find them unobjectionable under the Code, so the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 Reilly insists that our conclusion should nonetheless be avoided\n\nbecause \u201cprocedures that burden the debtor\u2019s exemption entitlements,\nlike those that impair a debtor\u2019s discharge generally, are to be con\u00ad\nstrued narrowly.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33 (citing Kawaauhau v.\nGeiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998)). This argument misses the mark for\ntwo reasons. First, the only burdens our conclusion imposes are bur\u00ad\ndens the Code itself prescribes, specifically, the burdens the Code\nplaces on debtors to state their claimed exemptions accurately and to\nconform such claims to statutory limits. Second, and in any event,\nGeiger and the other cases Reilly cites emphasize in the discharge\ncontext the importance of limiting exceptions to discharge to \u201cthose\nplainly expressed,\u201d a principle that supports our approach here.

See Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent 21, 55\u201368. Although none of Reilly\u2019s policy\narguments can overcome the Code provisions or the as\u00ad\npects of Taylor that govern this case, our decision fully\naccords with all of the policies she identifies. We agree\nthat \u201cexemptions in bankruptcy cases are part and parcel\nof the fundamental bankruptcy concept of a \u2018fresh start.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondent 21 (quoting Rousey, 544 U. S., at\n325); see Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S.\n365, 367 (2007). We disagree that this policy required\nSchwab to object to a facially valid claim of exemption on\npain of forfeiting his ability to preserve for the estate any\nvalue in Reilly\u2019s business equipment beyond the value of\nthe interest she declared exempt. This approach threat\u00ad\nens to convert a fresh start into a free pass.\n  As we emphasized in Rousey, \u201c[t]o help the debtor obtain\na fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code permits him to with\ndraw from the estate certain interests in property, such as\nhis car or home, up to certain values.\u201d 544 U. S., at 325\n(emphasis added). The Code limits exemptions in this\nfashion because every asset the Code permits a debtor to\nwithdraw from the estate is an asset that is not available\nto his creditors. See \u00a7522(b)(1). Congress balanced the\ndifficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors\nwith the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors,\nand it is not for us to alter this balance by requiring trus\u00ad\ntees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries\nbeyond those that govern an exemption\u2019s validity under\n20                       SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Code. See Lamie, 540 U. S., at 534, 538; Hartford, 530\nU. S., at 6; United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 95 (1985).\n  Reilly nonetheless contends that our approach creates\nperverse incentives for trustees and creditors to sleep on\ntheir rights. See Brief for Respondent 64, n. 10, 67\u201369.\nAgain, we disagree. Where a debtor intends to exempt\nnothing more than an interest worth a specified dollar\namount in an asset that is not subject to an unlimited or\nin-kind exemption under the Code, our approach will\nensure clear and efficient resolution of competing claims to\nthe asset\u2019s value. If an interested party does not object to\nthe claimed interest by the time the Rule 4003 period\nexpires, title to the asset will remain with the estate pur\u00ad\nsuant to \u00a7541, and the debtor will be guaranteed a pay\u00ad\nment in the dollar amount of the exemption. If an inter\u00ad\nested party timely objects, the court will rule on the\nobjection and, if it is improper, allow the debtor to make\nappropriate adjustments.18\n  Where, as here, it is important to the debtor to exempt\nthe full market value of the asset or the asset itself, our\ndecision will encourage the debtor to declare the value of\nher claimed exemption in a manner that makes the scope\nof the exemption clear, for example, by listing the exempt\nvalue as \u201cfull fair market value (FMV)\u201d or \u201c100% of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 We disagree that Reilly\u2019s approach to exemptions would more effi\u00ad\n\nciently dispose of competing claims to the asset. On Reilly\u2019s view, a\ntrustee would be encouraged (if not obliged) to object to claims to\nexempt a specific dollar amount of interest in an asset whenever the\nvalue of the exempt interest equaled the debtor\u2019s estimate of the asset\u2019s\nmarket value. Where the debtor genuinely intended to claim nothing\nmore than the face value of the exempt interest (which is rational if a\ndebtor wishes to ensure that his aggregate exemptions remain within\nstatutory limits), such an approach would engender needless objections\nand litigation, particularly if the equation that would precipitate the\nobjection often results from a default software entry.

If the trustee objects and the objection is\nsustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the\nportion of the exemption that exceeds the statutory allow\u00ad\nance, or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with\nher creditors to permit the exemption.

As the dissent concedes, \u201c[s]ection 522(d) catalogs exemp\u00ad\ntions of two types.\u201d Post, at 7, n. 5. \u201cMost exemptions\u2014and all of those\nReilly invoked\u2014place a monetary limit on the value of the property the\ndebtor may reclaim,\u201d and such exemptions are distinct from those made\npursuant to Code provisions that \u201cauthoriz[e] reclamation of the prop\u00ad\nerty in full without any cap on value.\u201d Ibid. Nothing about Reilly\u2019s\nSchedule entries establishes that Schwab should have treated Reilly\u2019s\nclaim for $10,718, an unobjectionable amount under the Code provi\u00ad\nsions she expressly invoked, as an objectionable claim for thousands of\ndollars more than those provisions allow, or as a claim for an uncapped\nexemption under Code provisions she did not invoke and the dissent\nadmits are \u201cnot at issue here.\u201d Ibid.\n   20 A trustee will not always file an objection. As the United States\n\nobserves, Schwab did not do so in this case with respect to certain\nassets (perishable foodstuffs from Reilly\u2019s commercial kitchen) that\ncould not be readily sold. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n28, n. 7 (explaining that Schwab could have objected to Reilly\u2019s claim of\na wildcard exemption for an interest in the food totaling $2,036 because\nthis claim, combined with her wildcard claims for an interest of $8,868\nin her business equipment and interests totaling $26 in her bank\naccounts, placed the total value of the interests she claimed exempt\nunder the wildcard provision $975 above then-applicable limits).\n22                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nBkrtcy. Proc. 1009(a). Either result will facilitate the\nexpeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable\nthe debtor (and the debtor\u2019s creditors) to achieve a fresh\nstart free of the finality and clouded-title concerns Reilly\ndescribes. See Brief for Respondent 57\u201359 (arguing that\n\u201c[u]nder [Schwab\u2019s] interpretation of Rule 4003(b), a\ndebtor would never have the certainty of knowing whether\nor not he or she may keep her exempted property until the\ncase had ended\u201d); id., at 66.21\n   For all of these reasons, the policy considerations Reilly\ncites support our approach. Where, as here, a debtor\naccurately describes an asset subject to an exempt interest\nand on Schedule C declares the \u201cvalue of [the] claimed\nexemption\u201d as a dollar amount within the range the Code\nallows, interested parties are entitled to rely upon that\nvalue as evidence of the claim\u2019s validity. Accordingly, we\nhold that Schwab was not required to object to Reilly\u2019s\nclaimed exemptions in her business equipment in order to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  21 Reilly\u2019sclouded-title argument arises only if one accepts her flawed\nconception of the exemptions in this case. According to Reilly, \u201conce the\nthirty-day deadline passed without objection\u201d to her claim, she was\n\u201centitled to know that she would emerge from bankruptcy with her\ncooking equipment intact.\u201d Brief for Respondent 57. There are two\nproblems with this argument. First, it assumes that the property she\nclaimed as exempt was the full value of the equipment. That assump\u00ad\ntion is incorrect for the reasons we explain. Second, her argument\nassumes that a claim to exempt the full value of the equipment would,\nif unopposed, entitle her to the equipment itself as opposed to a pay\u00ad\nment equal to the equipment\u2019s full value. That assumption is at least\nquestionable. Section 541 is clear that title to the equipment passed to\nReilly\u2019s estate at the commencement of her case, and \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and\n(6) are equally clear that her reclamation right is limited to exempting\nan interest in the equipment, not the equipment itself. Accordingly, it\nis far from obvious that the Code would \u201centitle\u201d Reilly to clear title in\nthe equipment even if she claimed as exempt a \u201cfull\u201d or \u201c100%\u201d interest\nin it (which she did not). Of course, it is likely that a trustee who fails\nto object to such a claim would have little incentive to do anything but\npass title in the asset to the debtor. But that does not establish the\nstatutory entitlement Reilly claims.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Absent timely objection, \u201cproperty claimed\n[by the debtor] as exempt . . . is exempt.\u201d \u00a7522(l).\n   The trustee in this case, petitioner William G. Schwab,\nmaintains that the obligation promptly to object to exemp\u00ad\ntion claims extends only to the qualification of an asset as\nexemptible, not to the debtor\u2019s valuation of the asset.\nRespondent Nadejda Reilly, the debtor-in-bankruptcy,\nurges that the timely objection requirement applies not\nonly to the debtor\u2019s designation of an asset as exempt; the\nrequirement applies as well, she asserts, to her estimate of\nthe asset\u2019s market value. That is so, she reasons, because\nthe asset\u2019s current dollar value is critical to the determi\u00ad\nnation whether she may keep the property intact and\noutside bankruptcy, or whether the trustee, at any time\nduring the course of the proceedings, may sell it.\n   The Court holds that challenges to the debtor\u2019s valua\u00ad\ntion of exemptible assets need not be made within the 30\u00ad\n2                    SCHWAB v.

On the list appended to\nSchedules B and C, Reilly set out by hand a 31-item inven\u00ad\ntory of her restaurant-plus-catering-venture equipment.\nNext to each item, e.g., \u201cDough Mixer,\u201d \u201cGas stove,\u201d\n\u201cHood,\u201d she specified, first, the purchase price and, next,\n\u201cToday\u2019s Market Value,\u201d which added up to $10,718 for the\nentire inventory. Id., at 51a\u201355a.1\n   As the laws securing exemption of her kitchen equip\u00ad\nment, Reilly specified in the second Schedule C column,\n\u00a7552(d)(6), the exemption covering trade tools, and\n\u00a7552(d)(5), the \u201cwildcard\u201d exemption. Id., at 58a.2 In the\nvalue-of-claimed-exemption column, she listed $1,850,\nthen the maximum trade-tools exemption, and $8,868,\ndrawn from her wildcard exemption, amounts adding up\nto $10,718. Ibid. And in the fourth, current-market\u00ad\nvalue, column, she recorded $10,718, corresponding to the\ntotal market value she had set out in her inventory and\nreported in Schedule B. Ibid.\n   Before the 30-day clock on filing objections had begun to\nrun, an appraiser told Schwab that Reilly\u2019s equipment was\nworth at least $17,000.

Id., at 141a\u2013143a.3\n   From Reilly\u2019s filings, the Bankruptcy Judge found it\nevident that Reilly had claimed the property itself, not its\ndollar value, as exempt. Id., at 168a\u2013169a (\u201cI know there\u2019s\nan argument . . . that . . . the property identified as exempt\nis really the [valuation] column, [i.e., $10,718,] but that\u2019s\nnot what the forms say. The forms say property declared\nas exempt and to see attached list. So, they\u2019re exempting\nall the property. . . . If the Trustee believes that . . . all the\nproperty cannot be exempt, [he] should object to it.\u201d).\n   The District Court and Court of Appeals similarly con\u00ad\ncluded that, by listing the identical amount, $10,718, as\nthe property\u2019s market value and the value of the claimed\nexemptions, Reilly had signaled her intention to safeguard\nall of her kitchen equipment from inclusion in the bank\u00ad\nruptcy estate.

The court may, for cause, extend the time\n     for filing objections if, before the time to object ex\u00ad\n     pires, a party in interest files a request for an exten\u00ad\n     sion.\u201d Rule 4003(b).4\n  Schwab having filed no objection within the allowable\n30 days, each of the tribunals below ruled that the entire\ninventory of Reilly\u2019s business equipment qualified as\nexempt in full. App. 168a; 403 B. R., at 339; 534 F. 3d, at\n178. The leading treatise on bankruptcy, the Court of\nAppeals noted, id., at 180, n. 4, is in accord:\n       \u201cNormally, if the debtor lists property as exempt,\n     that listing is interpreted as a claim for exemption of\n     the debtor\u2019s entire interest in the property, and the\n     debtor\u2019s valuation of that interest is treated as the\n     amount of the exemption claimed. Were it other\u00ad\n     wise\u2014that is, if the listing were construed to claim as\n     exempt only that portion of the property having the\n     value stated\u2014the provisions finalizing exemptions if\n     no objections are filed would be rendered meaningless.\n     The trustee or creditors could [anytime] claim that the\n     debtor\u2019s interest in the property was greater than the\n     value claimed as exempt and [then] object to the\n     debtor exempting his or her entire interest in the\n     property after the deadline for objections had passed.\u201d\n     9 Collier \u00b64003.02[1], pp. 4003\u20134 to 4003\u20135.\n  Agreeing with the courts below, I would hold that Reilly,\nby her precise identification of the exempt property, and\nher specification of $10,718 as both the current market\nvalue of her kitchen equipment and the value of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In 2008, this prescription was recodified without material change\n\nand designated Rule 4003(b)(1).\n6                    SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nclaimed exemptions, had made her position plain: She\nclaimed as exempt the listed property itself\u2014not the\ndollar amount, up to $10,718, that sale of the property by\nSchwab might yield. Because neither Schwab nor any\ncreditor lodged a timely objection, the listed property\nbecame exempt, reclaimed as property of the debtor, and\ntherefore outside the bankruptcy estate the trustee is\ncharged to administer.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   Pursuant to \u00a7522(l), Reilly filed a list of property she\nclaimed as exempt from the estate-in-bankruptcy. Her\nfiling left no doubt that her exemption claim encompassed\nher entire inventory of kitchen equipment. Schwab, in\nfact, was fully aware of the nature of the claim Reilly\nasserted. At the meeting of creditors, Reilly reiterated\nthat she sought to keep the equipment in her possession;\nshe would rather discontinue the bankruptcy proceeding,\nshe made plain, than lose her equipment. See supra, at 4,\nn. 3. Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) requires the trustee, if he\ncontests the debtor\u2019s exemption claim in whole or part, to\nfile an objection within 30 days after the meeting of credi\u00ad\ntors. Absent a timely objection, \u201cthe property claimed as\nexempt . . . is exempt.\u201d \u00a7522(l); Rule 4003. That prescrip\u00ad\ntion should be dispositive of this case.\n   The Court holds, however, that Schwab was not obliged\nto file a timely objection to the exemption Reilly claimed,\nand indeed could auction off her cooking equipment any\u00ad\ntime prior to her discharge. In so holding, the Court de\u00ad\ncrees that no objection need be made to a debtor\u2019s valua\u00ad\ntion of her property.\n   To support the conclusion that Rule 4003\u2019s timely objec\u00ad\ntion requirement does not encompass the debtor\u2019s estima\u00ad\ntion of her property\u2019s market value, the Court homes in on\nthe language of exemption prescriptions that are subject to\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

So long as a debtor\nvalues her claimed exemption at a dollar amount below\nthe statutory cap, the Court reasons, the claim is on-its\u00ad\nface permissible no matter the market value she ascribes\nto the asset. To evaluate the propriety of Reilly\u2019s declared\n\u201cinterest\u201d in her kitchen equipment, the Court concludes,\nSchwab was obliged promptly to inspect \u201cthree, and only\nthree, entries on Reilly\u2019s Schedule C: the description of the\nbusiness equipment . . . ; the Code provisions governing\nthe claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in\nthe column titled \u2018value of claimed exemption.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n12\u201313.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Section 522(d) catalogs exemptions of two types. Most exemptions\u2014\n\nand all of those Reilly invoked\u2014place a monetary limit on the value of\nthe property the debtor may reclaim. See, e.g., \u00a7522(d)(2) (\u201cmotor\nvehicle\u201d); \u00a7522(d)(3) (\u201chousehold furnishings, household goods, wearing\napparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, or musical instruments\u201d);\n\u00a7522(d)(4) (\u201cjewelry\u201d). For certain exemptions not at issue here, the\nBankruptcy Code authorizes reclamation of the property in full without\nany cap on value. See, e.g., \u00a7522(d)(7) (\u201cunmatured life insurance\ncontract\u201d); \u00a7522(d)(9) (\u201c[p]rofessionally prescribed health aids\u201d);\n\u00a7522(d)(11)(A) (\u201caward under a crime victim\u2019s reparation law\u201d).\n  6 In support of its view that market value is not relevant to determin\u00ad\n\ning the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d for purposes of Rule 4003(b)\u2019s\ntimely objection mandate, the Court observes that Schedule C did not\nrequire the debtor to list this information until 1991. Ante, at 14\u201315.\nPrior to 1991, however, debtors recorded market value on a different\nschedule. See Interim Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Sched\u00ad\nule B\u20132 (1979) (requiring debtor to list the \u201c[m]arket value of [her]\ninterest [in personal property] without deduction for . . . exemptions\nclaimed\u201d). Trustees assessing the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d\ntherefore, have always been able, from the face of the debtor\u2019s filings, to\ncompare the value of the claimed exemption to the property\u2019s declared\nmarket value. See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34.\n8                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   The Court\u2019s account, however, shuts from sight the vital\npart played by the fourth entry on Schedule C\u2014current\nmarket value\u2014when a capped exemption is claimed. A\ndebtor who estimates a market value below the cap, and\nlists an identical amount as the value of her claimed ex\u00ad\nemption, thereby signals that her aim is to keep the listed\nproperty in her possession, outside the estate-in\u00ad\nbankruptcy. In contrast, a debtor who estimates a market\nvalue above the cap, and above the value of her claimed\nexemption, thereby recognizes that she cannot shelter the\nproperty itself and that the trustee may seek to sell it for\nwhatever it is worth.7 Schedule C\u2019s final column, in other\nwords, alerts the trustee whether the debtor is claiming a\nright to retain the listed property itself as her own, a right\nsecured to her if the trustee files no timely objection.8\n   Because an asset\u2019s market value is key to determining\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 By authorizing exemption of assets that a debtor would want to\n\nkeep in kind, such as her jewelry and car, but limiting the exemptible\nvalue of this property, Congress struck a balance between debtors\u2019\nand creditors\u2019 interests: Debtors can reclaim items helpful to their\nfresh start after bankruptcy, but only if those items are of modest\nvalue. Assets of larger worth, however, are subject to liquidation so\nthat creditors may obtain a portion of the item\u2019s value. Cf. In re Price,\n370 F. 3d 362, 378 (CA3 2004) (\u201c[B]ankruptcy law is bilateral, replete\nwith protections and policy considerations favoring both debtors and\ncreditors.\u201d).\n   8 The significance of market value is what differentiates capped ex\u00ad\n\nemptions from uncapped ones that permit debtors to exempt certain\nproperty in kind regardless of its worth. See supra, at 7, n. 5. For\nuncapped exemptions, the nature of the property the debtor has re\u00ad\nclaimed is clear: If the exemption is valid, the debtor gets the asset in\nfull every time. For capped exemptions, however, market value is a\ncrucial component in determining whether the debtor gets the item\nitself or a sum of money representing a share of the item\u2019s liquidation\nvalue. Reading Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) to require objections to\nvaluation thus does not, as the Court contends, \u201celid[e] the distinction\u201d\nbetween capped and uncapped exemptions, ante, at 12 (emphasis\nadded), but instead accounts for that distinction.\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

But the\ncommonly understood definition of a property \u201cinterest\u201d is \u201c[a] legal\nshare in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right\nin property. . . . Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of\n[such] rights.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 828 (8th ed. 2004). Schwab,\ntherefore, could not comprehend whether Reilly claimed a monetary or\nan in-kind \u201cinterest\u201d in her kitchen equipment without comparing her\nmarket valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemp\u00ad\ntion. See supra, at 8\u20139. In line with the statutory text, a debtor\u2019s\nmarket valuation is an essential factor in determining the nature of the\n\u201cinterest\u201d a debtor lists as exempt. Bankruptcy \u201cforms, rules, treatise\nexcerpts, and policy considerations,\u201d ante, at 7, n. 5, corroborate, rather\nthan conflict with, this reading of the Code.\n10                        SCHWAB v.

As \u201cthere can be no possibility of further objection\nto the exemptions\u201d after this period elapses, the principal\nbankruptcy treatise observes, \u201cif the debtor is not yet in\npossession of the property claimed as exempt, it should be\nturned over to [her] at this time to effectuate fully the\nfresh start purpose of the exemptions.\u201d             9 Collier\n\u00b64003.03[3], p. 4003\u201313.\n   With the benefit of closure, and the certainty it brings,\nthe debtor may, at the end of the 30 days, plan for her\nfuture secure in the knowledge that the possessions she\nhas exempted in their entirety are hers to keep.

Would\ntrustees lack fair notice of the need to object? And would\ndebtors be tempted to undervalue their property in an\neffort to avoid the monetary cap on exemptions? In my\njudgment, all three questions should be answered no.\n                             A\n  The Court suggests that requiring timely objections to a\ndebtor\u2019s valuation of exempt property would saddle trus\u00ad\ntees with an unmanageable load. See ante, at 18 (declin\u00ad\ning to \u201cexpand . . . the universe of information an inter\u00ad\nested party must consider in evaluating the validity of a\nclaimed exemption\u201d).

See\nH. R. Rep. No. 95\u2013595, p. 127 (1977) (noting that \u201chousehold goods have\nlittle resale value\u201d but \u201creplacement costs of the goods are generally\nhigh\u201d).\n   12 This concern is questionable in light of the prevailing practice, for,\n\nas earlier noted, valuation objections are the most common Rule\n4003(b) challenge. See supra, at 2. By lopping off valuation disagree\u00ad\nments from the timely objection requirement, see, e.g., ante, at 10\u201311,\nn. 8, the Court so severely shrinks the Rule\u2019s realm that this question\n12                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntees, sooner or later, must attempt to ascertain the market\nvalue of exempted assets. They must do so to determine\nwhether sale of the items would likely produce surplus\nproceeds for the estate above the value of the claimed\nexemption, see \u00a7704(a)(1); the only question, then, is when\nthis market valuation must occur\u2014(1) within 30 days or\n(2) at any time before discharge? Removing valuation\nfrom Rule 4003\u2019s governance thus does little to reduce the\nlabors trustees must undertake.\n   The 30-day objection period, I note, does not impose on\ntrustees any additional duty, but rather guides the exer\u00ad\ncise of existing responsibilities; under Rule 4003(b), a\ntrustee must rank evaluation of the debtor\u2019s exemptions as\na priority item in his superintendence of the estate.13 And\nif the trustee entertains any doubt about the accuracy of a\ndebtor\u2019s estimation of market value, the procedure for\ninterposing objections is hardly arduous. The trustee need\nonly file with the court a simple declaration stating that\nan item\u2019s value exceeds the amount listed by the debtor.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\narises: Why are trustees granted a full 30 days to lodge objections?\nUnder the Court\u2019s reading of the Rule, trustees need only compare a\ndebtor\u2019s Schedule C to the text of the exemption prescriptions to assess\nan exemption claim\u2019s facial validity, with no further investigation\nnecessary. That comparison should take no more than minutes, surely\nnot a month.\n   13 Trustees, it bears noting, historically had valuation duties far more\n\nonerous than they have today. Rule 4003\u2019s predecessor required\ntrustees in the first instance, rather than debtors, to estimate the\nmarket value of property claimed as exempt. See Rule 403(b) (1975).\nTrustees had to provide this valuation to the court within 15 days of\ntheir appointment. See ibid.\n   14 The leading bankruptcy treatise supplies an illustrative valuation\n\nobjection:\n   \u201c[Name of Trustee], the duly qualified and acting trustee of the estate\nof the debtor, would show the court the following:\n   \u201c1. The debtor is not entitled under [the automobile exemption] to an\ninterest of more than $3,225 in an automobile.

Alterna\u00ad\ntively, the trustee can postpone the conclusion of the\nmeeting of creditors, from which the 30-day clock runs,\nsimply by adjourning the meeting to a future date. Rule\n2003(e). A trustee also may examine the debtor under\noath at the creditors\u2019 meeting, Rule 2003(b)(1); if he gath\u00ad\ners information impugning her exemption claims, he may\nask the bankruptcy court to hold a hearing to determine\nvaluation issues, Rule 4003(c). See Taylor, 503 U. S., at\n644 (\u201cIf [the trustee] did not know the value of [a claimed\nexemption], he could have sought a hearing on the issue\n. . . or . . . asked the Bankruptcy Court for an extension of\ntime to object.\u201d). See also NACBA Brief 19, 21\u201323 (listing\nways trustees may enlarge the limitations period for\nobjections). Trustees, in sum, have ample mechanisms at\ntheir disposal to gain the time and information they need\nto lodge objections to valuation.\n                               B\n  On affording trustees fair notice of the need to object,\nthe Court emphasizes that a debtor must list her claimed\nexemptions \u201cin a manner that makes the scope of the\nexemption clear.\u201d Ante, at 20.

Our decision in Taylor v. Freeland &\nKronz, the Court notes, is instructive. In Taylor, the\ndebtor recorded the term \u201c$ unknown\u201d as the value of a\nclaimed exemption, which, the Court observes, raised a\n\u201cwarning fla[g]\u201d because the value \u201cwas not plainly within\nthe limits the Code allows.\u201d Ante, at 17.\n   True, a debtor\u2019s schedules must give notice sufficient to\ncue the trustee that an objection may be in order. But a\n\u201cwarning flag\u201d is in the eye of the beholder: If a debtor\nlists identical amounts as the market value of exempted\nproperty and the value of her claimed exemption, she has,\non the face of her schedules, reclaimed the entire asset just\nas surely as if she had recorded \u201c100% of FMV\u201d in Sched\u00ad\nule C\u2019s value-of-claimed-exemption column.

Argued November 3, 2009\u2014Decided June 17, 2010\nRespondent Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy when her catering\n  business failed. She supported her petition with, inter alia, Schedule\n  B, on which debtors must list their assets, and Schedule C, on which\n  they must list the property they wish to reclaim as exempt. Her\n  Schedule B assets included cooking and other kitchen equipment, to\n  which she assigned an estimated market value of $10,718. On\n  Schedule C, she claimed two exempt interests in this \u201cbusiness\n  equipment\u201d: a \u201ctool[s] of the trade\u201d exemption for the statutory\n  maximum \u201c$1,850 in value,\u201d 11 U. S. C. \u00a7522(d)(6); and $8,868 under\n  the statutory provisions allowing miscellaneous, or \u201cwildcard,\u201d ex\n  emptions up to $10,225 in value. The claimed exemptions\u2019 total value\n  ($10,718) equaled Reilly\u2019s estimate of the equipment\u2019s market value.\n  Property claimed as exempt will be excluded from the bankruptcy es\n  tate \u201c[u]nless a party in interest\u201d objects, \u00a7522(l), within a certain 30\n  day period, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b). Absent an objection,\n  the property will be excluded from the estate even if the exemption\u2019s\n  value exceeds what the Code permits. See, e.g., \u00a7522(l); Taylor v.\n  Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642\u2013643.\n    Although an appraisal revealed that the equipment\u2019s total market\n  value could be as much as $17,200, petitioner Schwab, the bank\n  ruptcy estate\u2019s trustee, did not object to the claimed exemptions be\n  cause the dollar value Reilly assigned to each fell within the limits of\n  \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6). Schwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for per\n  mission to auction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718\n  she claimed exempt and the estate could distribute the remaining\n  value to her creditors. Reilly countered that by equating on Schedule\n  C the total value of her claimed exemptions in the equipment with\n  the equipment\u2019s estimated market value, she had put Schwab and\n2                          SCHWAB v.

She asserted that the estate had\n    forfeited its claim to any portion of that value because Schwab had\n    not objected within the Rule 4003(b) period, and that she would dis\n    miss her petition rather than sell her equipment.\n       The Bankruptcy Court denied Schwab\u2019s motion and Reilly\u2019s condi\n    tional motion to dismiss. The District Court denied Schwab relief, re\n    jecting his argument that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b) requires\n    a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where the amount the\n    debtor declares as the exemption\u2019s value is within the limits the Code\n    prescribes. Affirming, the Third Circuit agreed that Reilly\u2019s Schedule\n    C entries indicated her intent to exempt the equipment\u2019s full value.\n    Relying on Taylor, it held that Schwab\u2019s failure to object entitled\n    Reilly to exempt the full value of her equipment, even though that\n    value exceeded the amounts that Reilly declared and the Code per\n    mitted.\nHeld: Because Reilly gave \u201cthe value of [her] claimed exemption[s]\u201d on\n Schedule C dollar amounts within the range the Code allows for what\n it defines as the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d Schwab was not re\n quired to object to the exemptions in order to preserve the estate\u2019s\n right to retain any value in the equipment beyond the value of the\n exempt interest. Pp. 6\u201323.\n    (a) Reilly\u2019s complicated view of the trustee\u2019s statutory obligation,\n and her reading of Schedule C, does not accord with the Code. Pp. 6\u2013\n 15.\n      (1) The parties agree that this case is governed by \u00a7522(l), which\n states that a Chapter 7 debtor must \u201cfile a list of property that the\n debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b) of this section,\u201d and\n that \u201c[u]nless a party in interest objects, the property claimed as ex\n empt on such list is exempt.\u201d Reilly asserts that the \u201cproperty\n claimed as exempt\u201d refers to all of the information on Schedule C, in\n cluding the estimated market value of each asset. Schwab and\n amicus United States counter that because the Code defines such\n property as an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in a\n particular asset, not as the asset itself, the value of the property\n claimed exempt should be judged on the dollar value the debtor as\n signs the interest, not on the value the debtor assigns the asset.\n Pp. 6\u20139.\n      (2) Schwab and the United States are correct. The portion of\n \u00a7522(l) that resolves this case is not, as Reilly asserts, the provision\n stating that the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is ex\n empt\u201d unless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the portion\n that defines the objection\u2019s target, namely, the \u201clist of property that\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthe debtor claims as exempt under subsection (b).\u201d Section 522(b)\ndoes not define the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d by reference to the\nestimated market value. It refers only to property defined in \u00a7522(d),\nwhich in turn lists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim\nas exempt. Most of these categories and all the ones applicable here\ndefine \u201cproperty\u201d as the debtor\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d\u2014up to a specified dollar\namount\u2014in the assets described in the category, not as the assets\nthemselves. Schwab had no duty to object to the property Reilly\nclaimed as exempt because its stated value was within the limits the\nCode allows. Reilly\u2019s contrary view does not withstand scrutiny be\ncause it defines the target of a trustee\u2019s objection based on Schedule\nC\u2019s language and dictionary definitions of \u201cproperty\u201d at odds with the\nCode\u2019s definition. The Third Circuit failed to account for the Code\u2019s\ndefinition and for provisions that permit debtors to exempt certain\nproperty in kind or in full regardless of value. See, e.g., \u00a7522(d)(9).\nSchwab was entitled to evaluate the claimed exemptions\u2019 propriety\nbased on three Schedule C entries: the description of the business\nequipment in which Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code\nprovisions governing the claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly\nlisted in the column titled \u201cvalue of claimed exemption.\u201d This conclu\nsion does not render Reilly\u2019s market value estimate superfluous. It\nsimply confines that estimate to its proper role: aiding the trustee in\nadministering the estate by helping him identify assets that may\nhave value beyond the amount the debtor claims as exempt, or whose\nfull value may not be available for exemption. This interpretation is\nconsistent with the historical treatment of bankruptcy exemptions.\nPp. 9\u201315.\n   (b) Taylor does not dictate a contrary conclusion. While both Tay\nlor and this case concern the consequences of a trustee\u2019s failure to ob\nject to a claimed exemption within Rule 4003\u2019s time period, Taylor es\ntablishes and applies the straightforward proposition that an\ninterested party must object to a claimed exemption if the amount\nthe debtor lists as the \u201cvalue claimed exempt\u201d is not within statutory\nlimits. In Taylor, the value listed in Schedule C (\u201c$ unknown\u201d) was\nnot plainly within those limits, but here, the values ($8,868 and\n$1,850) are within Code limits and thus do not raise the warning flag\npresent in Taylor. Departing from Taylor would not only ignore the\npresumption that parties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law;\nit would also require the Court to expand the statutory definition of\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d and the universe of information an in\nterested party must consider in evaluating an exemption\u2019s validity.\nEven if the Code allowed such expansions, they would be ill advised.\nBasing the definition of \u201cproperty claimed exempt,\u201d and thus an in\nterested party\u2019s obligation to object under \u00a7522(l), on inferences that\n4                           SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    party must draw from preprinted bankruptcy schedules that evolve\n    over time, rather than on the facial validity of the value the debtor\n    assigns the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as defined by the Code,\n    would undermine the predictability the statute is designed to pro\n    vide. Pp. 16\u201318.\n      (c) Reilly\u2019s argument threatens to convert the Code\u2019s goal of giving\n    debtors a fresh start into a free pass. By permitting a debtor \u201cto\n    withdraw from the estate certain interests in property, . . . up to cer\n    tain values,\u201d Rousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325, Congress bal\n    anced the difficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors\n    with the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors. This\n    Court should not alter that balance by requiring trustees to object to\n    claimed exemptions based on form entries beyond those governing an\n    exemption\u2019s validity under the Code. In rejecting Reilly\u2019s approach,\n    the Court does not create incentives for trustees and creditors to\n    sleep on their rights. The decision reached here encourages a debtor\n    wishing to exempt an asset\u2019s full market value or the asset itself to\n    declare the value of the claimed exemption in a way that makes its\n    scope clear. Such declarations will encourage the trustee to object\n    promptly and preserve for the estate any value in the asset beyond\n    relevant statutory limits. If the trustee fails to object, or his objection\n    is overruled, the debtor will be entitled to exclude the asset\u2019s full\n    value. If the objection is sustained, the debtor will be required either\n    to forfeit the portion of the exemption exceeding the statutory allow\n    ance or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with creditors to\n    permit the exemption. See Rule 1009(a). Either result will facilitate\n    the expeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable the\n    debtor and creditors to achieve a fresh start free of Reilly\u2019s finality\n    and clouded-title concerns.

S. C. \u00a7541, subject to the debtor\u2019s right to\nreclaim certain property as \u201cexempt,\u201d \u00a7522(l). The Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Code specifies the types of property debtors may\nexempt, \u00a7522(b), as well as the maximum value of the\nexemptions a debtor may claim in certain assets, \u00a7522(d).\nProperty a debtor claims as exempt will be excluded from\nthe bankruptcy estate \u201c[u]nless a party in interest\u201d ob\u00ad\njects. \u00a7522(l).\n  This case presents an opportunity for us to resolve a\ndisagreement among the Courts of Appeals about what\nconstitutes a claim of exemption to which an interested\nparty must object under \u00a7522(l). The issue is whether an\ninterested party must object to a claimed exemption\nwhere, as here, the Code defines the property the debtor is\nauthorized to exempt as an interest, the value of which\nmay not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a particular\ntype of asset, and the debtor\u2019s schedule of exempt property\naccurately describes the asset and declares the \u201cvalue of\n2                            SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n[the] claimed exemption\u201d in that asset to be an amount\nwithin the limits that the Code prescribes. Fed. Rule\nBkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Schedule C (1991) (hereinaf\u00ad\nter Schedule C). We hold that, in cases such as this, an\ninterested party need not object to an exemption claimed\nin this manner in order to preserve the estate\u2019s ability to\nrecover value in the asset beyond the dollar value the\ndebtor expressly declared exempt.\n                              I\n   Respondent Nadejda Reilly filed for Chapter 7 bank\u00ad\nruptcy when her catering business failed. She supported\nher petition with various schedules and statements, two of\nwhich are relevant here: Schedule B, on which the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Rules require debtors to list their assets (most of\nwhich become property of the estate), and Schedule C, on\nwhich the Rules require debtors to list the property they\nwish to reclaim as exempt. The assets Reilly listed on\nSchedule B included an itemized list of cooking and other\nkitchen equipment that she described as \u201cbusiness equip\u00ad\nment,\u201d and to which she assigned an estimated market\nvalue of $10,718. App. 40a, 49a\u201355a.\n   On Schedule C, Reilly claimed two exempt interests in\nthis equipment pursuant to different sections of the Code.\nReilly claimed a \u201ctool[s] of the trade\u201d exemption of $1,850\nin the equipment under \u00a7522(d)(6), which permits a debtor\nto exempt his \u201caggregate interest, not to exceed $1,850 in\nvalue, in any implements, professional books, or tools, of\n[his] trade.\u201d See also 69 Fed. Reg. 8482 (2004) (Table).\nAnd she claimed a miscellaneous exemption of $8,868 in\nthe equipment under \u00a7522(d)(5), which, at the time she\nfiled for bankruptcy, permitted a debtor to take a \u201cwild\u00ad\ncard\u201d exemption equal to the \u201cdebtor\u2019s aggregate interest\nin any property, not to exceed\u201d $10,225 \u201cin value.\u201d1 See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The   1994 version of 11 U.

The total value of these claimed exemptions\n($10,718) equaled the value Reilly separately listed on\nSchedules B and C as the equipment\u2019s estimated market\nvalue, see id., at 49a, 58a.\n   Subject to exceptions not relevant here, the Federal\nRules of Bankruptcy Procedure require interested parties\nto object to a debtor\u2019s claimed exemptions within 30 days\nafter the conclusion of the creditors\u2019 meeting held pursu\u00ad\nant to Rule 2003(a). See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b).\nIf an interested party fails to object within the time al\u00ad\nlowed, a claimed exemption will exclude the subject prop\u00ad\nerty from the estate even if the exemption\u2019s value exceeds\nwhat the Code permits. See, e.g., \u00a7522(l); Taylor v. Free\nland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 642\u2013643 (1992).\n   Petitioner William G. Schwab, the trustee of Reilly\u2019s\nbankruptcy estate, did not object to Reilly\u2019s claimed ex\u00ad\nemptions in her business equipment because the dollar\nvalue Reilly assigned each exemption fell within the limits\nthat \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6) prescribe. App. 163a. But be\u00ad\ncause an appraisal revealed that the total market value of\nReilly\u2019s business equipment could be as much as $17,200,2\nSchwab moved the Bankruptcy Court for permission to\nauction the equipment so Reilly could receive the $10,718\nshe claimed as exempt, and the estate could distribute the\nequipment\u2019s remaining value (approximately $6,500) to\nReilly\u2019s creditors.

See 69 Fed. Reg. 8482\n(Table). In 2007 and 2010 the limits were again increased. See 72 id.,\nat 7082 (Table); 75 id., at 8748 (Table).\n  2 Schwab concedes that the appraisal occurred before Rule 4003(b)\u2019s\n\n30-day window for objecting to the claimed exemptions had passed. See\nBrief for Petitioner 15.\n4                         SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Reilly opposed Schwab\u2019s motion. She argued that by\nequating on Schedule C the total value of the exemptions\nshe claimed in the equipment with the equipment\u2019s esti\u00ad\nmated market value, she had put Schwab and her credi\u00ad\ntors on notice that she intended to exempt the equipment\u2019s\nfull value, even if that amount turned out to be more than\nthe dollar amount she declared, and more than the Code\nallowed. Id., at 165a. Citing \u00a7522(l), Reilly asserted that\nbecause her Schedule C notified Schwab of her intent to\nexempt the full value of her business equipment, he was\nobliged to object if he wished to preserve the estate\u2019s right\nto retain any value in the equipment in excess of the\n$10,718 she estimated. Because Schwab did not object\nwithin the time prescribed by Rule 4003(b), Reilly asserted\nthat the estate forfeited its claim to such value. Id., at\n165a. Reilly further informed the Bankruptcy Court that\nexempting her business equipment from the estate was so\nimportant to her that she would dismiss her bankruptcy\ncase if doing so was the only way to avoid the equipment\u2019s\nsale at auction.3\n  The Bankruptcy Court denied both Schwab\u2019s motion to\nauction the equipment and Reilly\u2019s conditional motion to\ndismiss her case. See In re Reilly, 403 B. R. 336 (Bkrtcy.\nCt. MD Pa. 2006). Schwab sought relief from the District\nCourt, arguing that neither the Code nor Rule 4003(b)\nrequires a trustee to object to a claimed exemption where\nthe amount the debtor declares as the \u201cvalue of [the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Reilly\u2019s desire to avoid the equipment\u2019s auction is understandable\n\nbecause the equipment, which Reilly\u2019s parents purchased for her\ndespite their own financial difficulties, has \u201c \u2018extraordinary sentimental\nvalue.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 5 (quoting App. 152a\u2013153a). But the\nsentimental value of the property cannot drive our decision in this case,\nbecause sentimental value is not a basis for construing the Bankruptcy\nCode. Because the Code imposes limits on exemptions, many debtors\nwho seek to take advantage of the Code are, no doubt, put to the\nsimilarly difficult choice of parting with property of \u201cextraordinary\nsentimental value.\u201d Id., at 152a\u2212153a; see infra, at 19\u201323.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The Dis\u00ad\ntrict Court rejected Schwab\u2019s argument, and the Court of\nAppeals affirmed. See In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173 (CA3\n2008).\n   The Court of Appeals agreed with the Bankruptcy Court\nthat by equating on Schedule C the total value of her\nexemptions in her business equipment with the equip\u00ad\nment\u2019s market value, Reilly \u201cindicate[d] the intent\u201d to\nexempt the equipment\u2019s full value. Id., at 174. In reach\u00ad\ning this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our\ndecision in Taylor:\n    \u201c[W]e believe this case to be controlled by Taylor.\n    Just as we perceive it was important to the Taylor\n    Court that the debtor meant to exempt the full\n    amount of the property by listing \u2018unknown\u2019 as both\n    the value of the property and the value of the exemp\u00ad\n    tion, it is important to us that Reilly valued the busi\u00ad\n    ness equipment at $10,718 and claimed an exemption\n    in the same amount. Such an identical listing put\n    Schwab on notice that Reilly intended to exempt the\n    property fully.\n          .          .          .           .          .\n    \u201c \u2018[A]n unstated premise\u2019 of Taylor was \u2018that a debtor\n    who exempts the entire reported value of an asset is\n    claiming the \u201cfull amount,\u201d whatever it turns out to\n    be.\u2019 \u201d 534 F. 3d, at 178\u2212179.\nRelying on this \u201cunstated premise,\u201d the Court of Appeals\nheld that Schwab\u2019s failure to object to Reilly\u2019s claimed\nexemptions entitled Reilly to the equivalent of an in-kind\ninterest in her business equipment, even though the value\nof that exemption exceeded the amount that Reilly de\u00ad\nclared on Schedule C and the amount that the Code al\u00ad\nlowed her to withdraw from the bankruptcy estate. Ibid.\n  As noted, the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision adds to dis\u00ad\n6                         SCHWAB v.

See 556 U. S. ___ (2009). We conclude that the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 approach fails to account for the text of\nthe relevant Code provisions and misinterprets our deci\u00ad\nsion in Taylor. Accordingly, we reverse.\n                             II\n   The starting point for our analysis is the proper inter\u00ad\npretation of Reilly\u2019s Schedule C. If we read the Schedule\nReilly\u2019s way, she claimed exemptions in her business\nequipment that could exceed statutory limits, and thus\nclaimed exemptions to which Schwab should have objected\nif he wished to enforce those limits for the benefit of the\nestate. If we read Schedule C Schwab\u2019s way, Reilly\nclaimed valid exemptions to which Schwab had no duty to\nobject. The Court of Appeals construed Schedule C Reil\u00ad\nly\u2019s way and interpreted her claimed exemptions as im\u00ad\nproper, and therefore objectionable, even though their\ndeclared value was facially within the applicable Code\nlimits. In so doing, the Court of Appeals held that trustees\nevaluating the validity of exemptions in cases like this\ncannot take a debtor\u2019s claim at face value, and specifically\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 CompareIn re Williams, 104 F. 3d 688, 690 (CA4 1997) (holding\nthat interested parties have no duty to object to a claimed exemption\nwhere the dollar amount the debtor assigns the exemption is facially\nwithin the range the Code allows for the type of property in issue); In re\nWick, 276 F. 3d 412 (CA8 2002) (employing reasoning similar to Wil\nliams, but stopping short of articulating a clear rule), with In re Green,\n31 F. 3d 1098, 1100 (CA11 1994) (\u201cA debtor who exempts the entire\nreported value of an asset is claiming the [asset\u2019s] \u2018full amount,\u2019 what\u00ad\never it turns out to be\u201d); In re Anderson, 377 B.

This complicated view of the trustee\u2019s\nstatutory obligation, and the strained reading of Schedule\nC on which it rests, is inconsistent with the Code.5\n   The parties agree that this case is governed by \u00a7522(l),\nwhich states that a Chapter 7 debtor must \u201cfile a list of\nproperty that the debtor claims as exempt under subsec\u00ad\ntion (b) of this section,\u201d and further states that \u201c[u]nless a\nparty in interest objects, the property claimed as exempt\non such list is exempt.\u201d The parties further agree that the\n\u201clist\u201d to which \u00a7522(l) refers is the \u201clist of property . . .\nclaim[ed] as exempt\u201d currently known as \u201cSchedule C.\u201d\nSee Schedule C.6 The parties, like the Courts of Appeals,\ndisagree about what information on Schedule C defines\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d for purposes of evaluat\u00ad\ning an exemption\u2019s propriety under \u00a7522(l). Reilly asserts\nthat the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d is defined by refer\u00ad\nence to all the information on Schedule C, including the\nestimated market value of each asset in which the debtor\nclaims an exempt interest. Schwab and the United States\nas amicus curiae argue that the Code specifically defines\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as an interest, the value\nof which may not exceed a certain dollar amount, in a\nparticular asset, not as the asset itself.

See Brief for Respon\u00ad\ndent 22\u201328. Relying on this premise, Reilly argues that\nwhere, as here, a debtor equates the total value of her\nclaimed exemptions in a certain asset (column three) with\nher estimate of the asset\u2019s market value (column four), she\nestablishes the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as the full\nvalue of the asset, whatever that turns out to be. See ibid.\nAccordingly, Reilly argues that her Schedule C clearly put\nSchwab on notice that she \u201cintended\u201d to claim an exemp\u00ad\ntion for the full value of her business equipment, and that\nSchwab\u2019s failure to oppose the exemption in a timely\nmanner placed the full value of the equipment outside the\nestate\u2019s reach.\n   Schwab does not dispute that columns three and four\napprised him that Reilly equated the total value of her\nclaimed exemptions in the equipment ($1,850 plus $8,868)\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

He simply\ndisagrees with Reilly that this \u201cidentical listing put [him]\non notice that Reilly intended to exempt the property\nfully,\u201d regardless whether its value exceeded the exemp\u00ad\ntion limits the Code prescribes. 534 F. 3d, at 178. Schwab\nand amicus United States instead contend that the Code\ndefines the \u201cproperty\u201d Reilly claimed as exempt under\n\u00a7522(l) as an \u201cinterest\u201d whose value cannot exceed a cer\u00ad\ntain dollar amount. Brief for Petitioner 20\u201326; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioner 3\u20136; Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 12\u201318. Construing Reilly\u2019s Schedule C in light of\nthis statutory definition, they contend that Reilly\u2019s\nclaimed exemption was facially unobjectionable because\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (i.e., two interests in her\nbusiness equipment worth $8,868 and $1,850, respec\u00ad\ntively) is property Reilly was clearly entitled to exclude\nfrom her estate under the Code provisions she referenced\nin column 2. See supra, at 8 (citing \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6)).\nAccordingly, Schwab and the United States conclude that\nSchwab had no obligation to object to the exemption in\norder to preserve for the estate any value in Reilly\u2019s busi\u00ad\nness equipment beyond the total amount ($10,718) Reilly\nproperly claimed as exempt.\n   We agree. The portion of \u00a7522(l) that resolves this case\nis not, as Reilly asserts, the provision stating that the\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt on [Schedule C] is exempt\u201d\nunless an interested party objects. Rather, it is the por\u00ad\ntion of \u00a7522(l) that defines the target of the objection,\nnamely, the portion that says Schwab has a duty to object\nto the \u201clist of property that the debtor claims as exempt\nunder subsection (b).\u201d (Emphasis added.) That subsec\u00ad\ntion, \u00a7522(b), does not define the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt\u201d by reference to the estimated market value on\nwhich Reilly and the Court of Appeals rely. Brief for\nRespondent 22\u201323; 534 F. 3d, at 178. Section 522(b)\nrefers only to property defined in \u00a7522(d), which in turn\n10                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlists 12 categories of property that a debtor may claim as\nexempt. As we have recognized, most of these categories\n(and all of the categories applicable to Reilly\u2019s exemptions)\ndefine the \u201cproperty\u201d a debtor may \u201cclai[m] as exempt\u201d as\nthe debtor\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d\u2014up to a specified dollar amount\u2014\nin the assets described in the category, not as the assets\nthemselves. \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5)\u2013(6); see also \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(1)\u2013(4), (8);\nRousey v. Jacoway, 544 U. S. 320, 325 (2005); Owen v.\nOwen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). Viewing Reilly\u2019s form\nentries in light of this definition, we agree with Schwab\nand the United States that Schwab had no duty to object\nto the property Reilly claimed as exempt (two interests in\nher business equipment worth $1,850 and $8,868) because\nthe stated value of each interest, and thus of the \u201cprop\u00ad\nerty claimed as exempt,\u201d was within the limits the Code\nallows.7\n   Reilly\u2019s contrary view of Schwab\u2019s obligations under\n\u00a7522(l) does not withstand scrutiny because it defines the\ntarget of a trustee\u2019s objection\u2014the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt\u201d\u2014based on language in Schedule C and dictionary\ndefinitions of \u201cproperty,\u201d see Brief for Respondent 24\u201325,\n40\u201341, that the definition in the Code itself overrides.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Schwab\u2019s statutory duty to object to the exemptions in this case\n\nturns solely on whether the value of the property claimed as exempt\nexceeds statutory limits because the parties agree that Schwab had no\ncause to object to Reilly\u2019s attempt to claim exemptions in the equipment\nat issue, or to the applicability of the Code provisions Reilly cited in\nsupport of her exemptions.\n  8 The dissent\u2019s approach suffers from a similar flaw, and misstates\n\nour holding in critiquing it. See post, at 1\u22122 (asserting that by refusing\nto subject \u201cchallenges to the debtor\u2019s valuation of exemptible assets\u201d to\nthe \u201c30-day\u201d objection period in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure\n4003(b), we \u201cdrastically reduc[e] Rule 4003\u2019s governance\u201d).

As noted above, \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6) define the\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d as an \u201cinterest\u201d in Reilly\u2019s\nbusiness equipment, not as the equipment per se. Sections\n522(d)(5) and (6) further and plainly state that claims to\nexempt such interests are statutorily permissible, and\nthus unobjectionable, if the value of the claimed interest is\nbelow a particular dollar amount.9 That is the case here,\nand Schwab was entitled to rely upon these provisions in\nevaluating whether Reilly\u2019s exemptions were objectionable\nunder the Code. See Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540\nU. S. 526, 534 (2004); Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v.\nUnion Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000). The\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 contrary holding not only fails to account\nfor the Code\u2019s definition of the \u201cproperty claimed as ex\u00ad\nempt.\u201d It also fails to account for the provisions in \u00a7522(d)\nthat permit debtors to exempt certain property in kind or\nin full regardless of value. See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(9) (profes\u00ad\nsionally prescribed health aids), (10)(C) (disability bene\u00ad\nfits), (7) (unmatured life insurance contracts). We decline\nto construe Reilly\u2019s claimed exemptions in a manner that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthis point. Accordingly, our holding does not \u201creduc[e] Rule 4003\u2019s\ngovernance,\u201d nor does it express any judgment on what constrains\nobjections to the type of \u201cmarket value\u201d estimates, post, at 1, the\ndissent equates with the dollar value a debtor assigns the \u201cproperty\nclaimed as exempt\u201d as defined by the Code, see, e.g., post, at 2, 6.\n   9 Treating such claims as unobjectionable is consistent with our pre\u00ad\n\ncedents. See, e.g., Rousey, 544 U. S., at 325. It also accords with\nbankruptcy court decisions holding that where, as here, a debtor claims\nan exemption pursuant to provisions that (like \u00a7522(d)(6)) permit the\ndebtor to exclude from the estate only an \u201cinterest\u201d in certain property,\nthe \u201cproperty\u201d that becomes exempt absent objection, \u00a7522(l), is only\nthe \u201cpartial interest\u201d claimed as exempt and not \u201cthe asset as a whole,\u201d\ne.g., In re Soost, 262 B. R. 68, 72 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA8 2001).\n12                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nelides the distinction between these provisions and provi\u00ad\nsions such as \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (6), see, e.g., Duncan v.\nWalker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001), particularly based upon\nan entry on Schedule C\u2014Reilly\u2019s estimate of her equip\u00ad\nment\u2019s market value\u2014to which the Code does not refer in\ndefining the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt.\u201d10\n   For all of these reasons, we conclude that Schwab was\nentitled to evaluate the propriety of the claimed exemp\u00ad\ntions based on three, and only three, entries on Reilly\u2019s\nSchedule C: the description of the business equipment in\nwhich Reilly claimed the exempt interests; the Code provi\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The dissent\u2019s approach does not avoid these concerns. The dissent\n\ninsists that \u201ca debtor\u2019s market valuation [of the equipment in which she\nclaims an exempt interest] is an essential factor in determining the\nnature of the \u2018interest\u2019 [the] debtor lists as exempt\u201d (and thus in deter\u00ad\nmining whether the claimed exemption is objectionable), because\n\u201cwithout comparing [the debtor\u2019s] market valuation of the equipment to\nthe value of her claimed exemption\u201d the trustee \u201ccould not comprehend\nwhether [the debtor] claimed a monetary or an in-kind \u2018interest\u2019 in [the]\nequipment.\u201d Post, at 9, n. 9. This argument overlooks the fact that\nthere is another way the trustee could discern from the \u201cface of the\ndebtor\u2019s filings,\u201d post, at 7, n. 6, whether the debtor claimed as exempt\na \u201cmonetary or an in-kind \u2018interest\u2019 in\u201d her equipment, post, at 9, n. 9:\nThe trustee could simply consult the Code provisions the debtor listed\nas governing the exemption in question. Here, those provisions,\n\u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and (d)(6), expressly describe the exempt interest as an\n\u201cinterest\u201d \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a specified dollar amount. Accordingly, it was\nentirely appropriate for Schwab to view Reilly\u2019s schedule entries as\nexempting an interest in her business equipment in the (declared and\nunobjectionable) amounts of $1,850 and $8,868. Viewing the entries\notherwise, i.e., as exempting the equipment in kind or in full no matter\nwhat its dollar value, would unnecessarily treat the exemption as\nviolating the limits imposed by the Code provisions that govern it, as\nwell as ignore the distinction between those provisions and the provi\u00ad\nsions that \u201cauthoriz[e] reclamation of the property in full without any\ncap on value,\u201d post, at 7, n. 5. And it would do all of this based on\ninformation (identical dollar amounts in columns three and four of\nSchedule C) that Schwab and one of his amici say often result from a\ndefault setting in commercial bankruptcy software.

See, e.g., 3 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice\n\u00a756:7 (3d ed. 2009); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n16; Dept. of Justice, Executive Office for U. S.

As\nnoted, most assets become property of the estate upon\ncommencement of a bankruptcy case, see 11 U. S. C. \u00a7541,\nand exemptions represent the debtor\u2019s attempt to reclaim\nthose assets or, more often, certain interests in those\nassets, to the creditors\u2019 detriment. Accordingly, it is at\nleast useful for a trustee to be able to compare the value of\nthe claimed exemption (which typically represents the\ndebtor\u2019s interest in a particular asset) with the asset\u2019s\nestimated market value (which belongs to the estate sub\u00ad\nject to any valid exemption) without having to consult\nseparate schedules.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 The  dissent\u2019s argument that the estimate plays a greater role, and\nis \u201cvital,\u201d post, at 8, to determining whether the value a debtor assigns\nthe \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (here, an interest in certain business\nequipment) is objectionable, see post, at 8\u22129, lacks statutory support\nbecause the governing Code provisions phrase the exemption limit as a\nsimple dollar amount. The dissent\u2019s view, see post, at 7\u22129, might be\nplausible if the Code stated that the debtor could exempt an interest in\nher equipment \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a certain percentage of the equipment\u2019s\n14                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Our interpretation of Schwab\u2019s statutory obligations is\nnot only consistent with the governing Code provisions; it\nis also consistent with the historical treatment of bank\u00ad\nruptcy exemptions. Congress has permitted debtors to\nexempt certain property from their bankruptcy estates for\nmore than two centuries. See Act of Apr. 4, 1800, ch. 19,\n\u00a75, 2 Stat. 23.12 Throughout these periods, debtors have\nvalidly exempted property based on forms that required\nthe debtor to list the value of a claimed exemption without\nalso estimating the market value of the asset in which the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmarket value, because then it might be necessary to \u201ccompar[e] [the\ndebtor\u2019s] market valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed\nexemption\u201d to determine the exemption\u2019s propriety. Post, at 9, n. 9.\nBut the Code does not phrase the exemption cap in such terms. More\u00ad\nover, even accepting that the equivalent Schedule C entries the dissent\nrelies upon represent a claim to exempt an asset\u2019s full value, the\ndissent does not explain why this equivalence precludes a trustee from\nrelying on the dollar amount the debtor expressly assigns both entries.\nAccording to the dissent, a trustee faced with such entries should\nassume not only that the debtor reclaims from the estate what she\nbelieves to be the full value of an asset in which the Code allows her to\nexempt an interest \u201cnot to exceed\u201d a certain dollar amount, e.g.,\n\u00a7522(d)(6), but also that the debtor would continue to claim the asset\u2019s\nfull value as exempt even if that value exceeds her estimate to a point\nthat would cause her claim to violate the Code. The schedule entries\nthemselves do not compel this assumption, and the Code provisions\nthey invoke undercut it. The evidence that the debtor in this case\nwould have chosen that course is external to her exemption schedule.\nSee, e.g., supra, at 4 (citing statements in Reilly\u2019s motion to dismiss);\npost, at 4, n. 3, 6 (same). And in the ordinary case, particularly if the\nequivalent entries the dissent relies upon result from a software de\u00ad\nfault, see n. 10, supra, there is no reason to assume that a debtor would\nwant to violate the Code or jeopardize other exemptions if her market\nvalue estimate turns out to be wrong.\n  12 See also Act of Aug. 19, 1841, ch. 9, \u00a73, 5 Stat. 442; Act of Mar. 2,\n\n1867, ch. 176, \u00a711, 14 Stat. 521, amended by Act of June 22, 1874, 18\nStat., Pt. 3, p. 182; Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, \u00a76, 30 Stat.\n548, 11 U.

See Communica\u00ad\n\ntion from THE CHIEF JUSTICE of the United States Transmitting\nAmendments to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure Prescribed\nby the Court, Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 2075, H. R. Doc. 102\u201380, p. 558,\nreprinted in 11 Bankruptcy Rules Documentary History (1990\u20131991)\n(referencing only the fact of the amendment). It may have been to\nconsolidate and reconcile the separate forms debtors were previously\nrequired to file in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases, see, e.g., In re\nBeshirs, 236 B. R. 42, 46\u221247 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 1999), or simply to make\nit easier for trustees to evaluate whether certain assets were viable\ncandidates for liquidation. Whatever the case, it did not result from\nstatutory changes to the Code provisions that govern this dispute.\n   15 Because the Code provisions we rely upon to resolve this case do\n\nnot obligate trustees to object under Rule 4003(b) to a debtor\u2019s estimate\nof the market value of an asset in which the debtor claims an exempt\ninterest, our analysis does not depend on whether the schedule of\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (currently Schedule C) calls for such an\nestimate or not. We engage the point only because Reilly suggests that\nthe 1991 schedule revisions requiring debtors to provide such an\nestimate on the schedule of \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d means that\n16                        SCHWAB v.

See 534 F. 3d, at\n178. Taylor does not rest on what the debtor \u201cmeant\u201d to\nexempt. 534 F. 3d, at 178. Rather, Taylor applies to the\nface of a debtor\u2019s claimed exemption the Code provisions\nthat compel reversal here.\n  The debtor in Taylor, like the debtor here, filed a sched\u00ad\nule of exemptions with the Bankruptcy Court on which the\ndebtor described the property subject to the claimed ex\u00ad\nemption, identified the Code provision supporting the\nexemption, and listed the dollar value of the exemption.\nCritically, however, the debtor in Taylor did not, like the\ndebtor here, state the value of the claimed exemption as a\nspecific dollar amount at or below the limits the Code\nallows. Instead, the debtor in Taylor listed the value of\nthe exemption itself as \u201c$ unknown\u201d:\n           Schedule B-4. \u2500Property Claimed Exempt\nType of         Location, Description,     Specify the     Value Claimed\nProperty        and, So Far As Relevant    Statute         Exempt\n                to the Claim of Exemp\u00ad     Creating the\n                tion, Present Use of       Exemption\n                Property\nProceeds from   Winn v.

See Brief for Respondent 40\u221241. The dissent\nranges far beyond even this unavailing argument in suggesting that the\nmarket value estimate served as \u201can essential factor in determining the\nnature of the \u2018interest\u2019 a debtor lists as exempt,\u201d post, at 9, n. 9, even\nbefore 1991 when that estimate did not appear on the schedule of\n\u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d (former Schedule B\u22124), but rather ap\u00ad\npeared on former \u201cSchedule B\u20132,\u201d post, at 7, n. 6, which merely listed\nthe debtor\u2019s \u201cpersonal property\u201d as of the date of the petition filing.\nInterim Fed.

S. ____ (2010)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrendered the debtor\u2019s claimed exemption objectionable on\nits face because the exemption concerned an asset (lawsuit\nproceeds) that the Code did not permit the debtor to ex\u00ad\nempt beyond a specific dollar amount. See 503 U. S., at\n642. Accordingly, although this case and Taylor both\nconcern the consequences of a trustee\u2019s failure to object to\na claimed exemption within the time specified by Rule\n4003, the question arose in Taylor on starkly different\nfacts. In Taylor, the question concerned a trustee\u2019s obliga\u00ad\ntion to object to the debtor\u2019s entry of a \u201cvalue claimed\nexempt\u201d that was not plainly within the limits the Code\nallows. In this case, the opposite is true. The amounts\nReilly listed in the Schedule C column titled \u201cValue of\nClaimed Exemption\u201d are facially within the limits the\nCode prescribes and raise no warning flags that warranted\nan objection.16 See supra, at 8.\n   Taylor supports this conclusion. In holding otherwise,\nthe Court of Appeals focused on what it described as Tay\nlor\u2019s \u201c \u2018unstated premise\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018a debtor who exempts the\nentire reported value of an asset is claiming the \u201cfull\namount,\u201d whatever it turns out to be.\u2019 \u201d 534 F. 3d, at 179.\nBut Taylor does not rest on this premise. It establishes\nand applies the straightforward proposition that an inter\u00ad\nested party must object to a claimed exemption if the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   16 See, e.g., Barroso-Herrans, 524 F. 3d, at 345 (explaining that Sche\u00ad\n\ndule C entries listing the value of a claimed exemption as \u201cunknown,\u201d\n\u201cto be determined,\u201d or \u201c100%\u201d are \u201c \u2018red flags to trustees and creditors,\u2019\nand therefore put them on notice that if they do not object, the whole\nvalue of the asset\u2014whatever it might later turn out to be\u2014will be\nexempt\u201d (quoting 1 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b68.06[1][c][ii] (15th ed. rev.\n2007); citation and some internal quotation marks omitted)). The\ndissent concedes that a debtor\u2019s exemption schedule \u201cmust give notice\nsufficient to cue the trustee that an objection may be in order,\u201d and\nrightly observes that the sufficiency of a particular cue, or \u201c \u2018 warning\nflag,\u2019 \u201d may lie \u201cin the eye of the beholder.\u201d Post, at 14. In this case,\nhowever, the Code itself breaks the tie between what might otherwise\nbe two equally tenable views.\n18                      SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\namount the debtor lists as the \u201cvalue claimed exempt\u201d is\nnot within statutory limits, a test the value ($ unknown)\nin Taylor failed, and the values ($8,868 and $1,850) in this\ncase pass.\n   We adhere to this test. Doing otherwise would not only\ndepart from Taylor and ignore the presumption that par\u00ad\nties act lawfully and with knowledge of the law, cf. United\nStates v. Budd, 144 U. S. 154, 163 (1892); it would also\nrequire us to expand the statutory definition of \u201cproperty\nclaimed as exempt\u201d and the universe of information an\ninterested party must consider in evaluating the validity\nof a claimed exemption. Even if the Code allowed such\nexpansions, they would be ill advised. As evidenced by the\ndifferences between Reilly\u2019s Schedule C and the schedule\nin Taylor, preprinted bankruptcy schedules change over\ntime. Basing the definition of the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt,\u201d and thus an interested party\u2019s obligation to\nobject under \u00a7522(l), on inferences that party must draw\nfrom evolving forms, rather than on the facial validity of\nthe value the debtor assigns the \u201cproperty claimed as\nexempt\u201d as defined by the Code, would undermine the\npredictability the statute is designed to provide.17 For all\nof these reasons, we take Reilly\u2019s exemptions at face value\nand find them unobjectionable under the Code, so the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   17 Reilly insists that our conclusion should nonetheless be avoided\n\nbecause \u201cprocedures that burden the debtor\u2019s exemption entitlements,\nlike those that impair a debtor\u2019s discharge generally, are to be con\u00ad\nstrued narrowly.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33 (citing Kawaauhau v.\nGeiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998)). This argument misses the mark for\ntwo reasons. First, the only burdens our conclusion imposes are bur\u00ad\ndens the Code itself prescribes, specifically, the burdens the Code\nplaces on debtors to state their claimed exemptions accurately and to\nconform such claims to statutory limits. Second, and in any event,\nGeiger and the other cases Reilly cites emphasize in the discharge\ncontext the importance of limiting exceptions to discharge to \u201cthose\nplainly expressed,\u201d a principle that supports our approach here.

See Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent 21, 55\u201368. Although none of Reilly\u2019s policy\narguments can overcome the Code provisions or the as\u00ad\npects of Taylor that govern this case, our decision fully\naccords with all of the policies she identifies. We agree\nthat \u201cexemptions in bankruptcy cases are part and parcel\nof the fundamental bankruptcy concept of a \u2018fresh start.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Respondent 21 (quoting Rousey, 544 U. S., at\n325); see Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S.\n365, 367 (2007). We disagree that this policy required\nSchwab to object to a facially valid claim of exemption on\npain of forfeiting his ability to preserve for the estate any\nvalue in Reilly\u2019s business equipment beyond the value of\nthe interest she declared exempt. This approach threat\u00ad\nens to convert a fresh start into a free pass.\n  As we emphasized in Rousey, \u201c[t]o help the debtor obtain\na fresh start, the Bankruptcy Code permits him to with\ndraw from the estate certain interests in property, such as\nhis car or home, up to certain values.\u201d 544 U. S., at 325\n(emphasis added). The Code limits exemptions in this\nfashion because every asset the Code permits a debtor to\nwithdraw from the estate is an asset that is not available\nto his creditors. See \u00a7522(b)(1). Congress balanced the\ndifficult choices that exemption limits impose on debtors\nwith the economic harm that exemptions visit on creditors,\nand it is not for us to alter this balance by requiring trus\u00ad\ntees to object to claimed exemptions based on form entries\nbeyond those that govern an exemption\u2019s validity under\n20                       SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Code. See Lamie, 540 U. S., at 534, 538; Hartford, 530\nU. S., at 6; United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 95 (1985).\n  Reilly nonetheless contends that our approach creates\nperverse incentives for trustees and creditors to sleep on\ntheir rights. See Brief for Respondent 64, n. 10, 67\u201369.\nAgain, we disagree. Where a debtor intends to exempt\nnothing more than an interest worth a specified dollar\namount in an asset that is not subject to an unlimited or\nin-kind exemption under the Code, our approach will\nensure clear and efficient resolution of competing claims to\nthe asset\u2019s value. If an interested party does not object to\nthe claimed interest by the time the Rule 4003 period\nexpires, title to the asset will remain with the estate pur\u00ad\nsuant to \u00a7541, and the debtor will be guaranteed a pay\u00ad\nment in the dollar amount of the exemption. If an inter\u00ad\nested party timely objects, the court will rule on the\nobjection and, if it is improper, allow the debtor to make\nappropriate adjustments.18\n  Where, as here, it is important to the debtor to exempt\nthe full market value of the asset or the asset itself, our\ndecision will encourage the debtor to declare the value of\nher claimed exemption in a manner that makes the scope\nof the exemption clear, for example, by listing the exempt\nvalue as \u201cfull fair market value (FMV)\u201d or \u201c100% of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  18 We disagree that Reilly\u2019s approach to exemptions would more effi\u00ad\n\nciently dispose of competing claims to the asset. On Reilly\u2019s view, a\ntrustee would be encouraged (if not obliged) to object to claims to\nexempt a specific dollar amount of interest in an asset whenever the\nvalue of the exempt interest equaled the debtor\u2019s estimate of the asset\u2019s\nmarket value. Where the debtor genuinely intended to claim nothing\nmore than the face value of the exempt interest (which is rational if a\ndebtor wishes to ensure that his aggregate exemptions remain within\nstatutory limits), such an approach would engender needless objections\nand litigation, particularly if the equation that would precipitate the\nobjection often results from a default software entry.

If the trustee objects and the objection is\nsustained, the debtor will be required either to forfeit the\nportion of the exemption that exceeds the statutory allow\u00ad\nance, or to revise other exemptions or arrangements with\nher creditors to permit the exemption. See Fed. Rule\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   19 The dissent\u2019s observations about the poor fit between our admoni\u00ad\n\ntion and a form entry calling for a dollar amount, see post, at 15, simply\nreflect the tension between the Code\u2019s definition of \u201cproperty claimed\nas exempt\u201d (i.e., an interest, not to exceed a certain dollar amount, in\nReilly\u2019s business equipment) and Reilly\u2019s attempt to convert into a\ndollar value an improper claim to exempt the equipment itself, \u201c \u2018what\u00ad\never [its value] turns out to be.\u2019 \u201d In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173, 178\u2212179\n(CA3 2008). As the dissent concedes, \u201c[s]ection 522(d) catalogs exemp\u00ad\ntions of two types.\u201d Post, at 7, n. 5. \u201cMost exemptions\u2014and all of those\nReilly invoked\u2014place a monetary limit on the value of the property the\ndebtor may reclaim,\u201d and such exemptions are distinct from those made\npursuant to Code provisions that \u201cauthoriz[e] reclamation of the prop\u00ad\nerty in full without any cap on value.\u201d Ibid. Nothing about Reilly\u2019s\nSchedule entries establishes that Schwab should have treated Reilly\u2019s\nclaim for $10,718, an unobjectionable amount under the Code provi\u00ad\nsions she expressly invoked, as an objectionable claim for thousands of\ndollars more than those provisions allow, or as a claim for an uncapped\nexemption under Code provisions she did not invoke and the dissent\nadmits are \u201cnot at issue here.\u201d Ibid.\n   20 A trustee will not always file an objection. As the United States\n\nobserves, Schwab did not do so in this case with respect to certain\nassets (perishable foodstuffs from Reilly\u2019s commercial kitchen) that\ncould not be readily sold. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n28, n. 7 (explaining that Schwab could have objected to Reilly\u2019s claim of\na wildcard exemption for an interest in the food totaling $2,036 because\nthis claim, combined with her wildcard claims for an interest of $8,868\nin her business equipment and interests totaling $26 in her bank\naccounts, placed the total value of the interests she claimed exempt\nunder the wildcard provision $975 above then-applicable limits).\n22                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nBkrtcy. Proc. 1009(a). Either result will facilitate the\nexpeditious and final disposition of assets, and thus enable\nthe debtor (and the debtor\u2019s creditors) to achieve a fresh\nstart free of the finality and clouded-title concerns Reilly\ndescribes. See Brief for Respondent 57\u201359 (arguing that\n\u201c[u]nder [Schwab\u2019s] interpretation of Rule 4003(b), a\ndebtor would never have the certainty of knowing whether\nor not he or she may keep her exempted property until the\ncase had ended\u201d); id., at 66.21\n   For all of these reasons, the policy considerations Reilly\ncites support our approach. Where, as here, a debtor\naccurately describes an asset subject to an exempt interest\nand on Schedule C declares the \u201cvalue of [the] claimed\nexemption\u201d as a dollar amount within the range the Code\nallows, interested parties are entitled to rely upon that\nvalue as evidence of the claim\u2019s validity. Accordingly, we\nhold that Schwab was not required to object to Reilly\u2019s\nclaimed exemptions in her business equipment in order to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  21 Reilly\u2019sclouded-title argument arises only if one accepts her flawed\nconception of the exemptions in this case. According to Reilly, \u201conce the\nthirty-day deadline passed without objection\u201d to her claim, she was\n\u201centitled to know that she would emerge from bankruptcy with her\ncooking equipment intact.\u201d Brief for Respondent 57. There are two\nproblems with this argument. First, it assumes that the property she\nclaimed as exempt was the full value of the equipment. That assump\u00ad\ntion is incorrect for the reasons we explain. Second, her argument\nassumes that a claim to exempt the full value of the equipment would,\nif unopposed, entitle her to the equipment itself as opposed to a pay\u00ad\nment equal to the equipment\u2019s full value. That assumption is at least\nquestionable. Section 541 is clear that title to the equipment passed to\nReilly\u2019s estate at the commencement of her case, and \u00a7\u00a7522(d)(5) and\n(6) are equally clear that her reclamation right is limited to exempting\nan interest in the equipment, not the equipment itself. Accordingly, it\nis far from obvious that the Code would \u201centitle\u201d Reilly to clear title in\nthe equipment even if she claimed as exempt a \u201cfull\u201d or \u201c100%\u201d interest\nin it (which she did not). Of course, it is likely that a trustee who fails\nto object to such a claim would have little incentive to do anything but\npass title in the asset to the debtor. But that does not establish the\nstatutory entitlement Reilly claims.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Schwab,\nmaintains that the obligation promptly to object to exemp\u00ad\ntion claims extends only to the qualification of an asset as\nexemptible, not to the debtor\u2019s valuation of the asset.\nRespondent Nadejda Reilly, the debtor-in-bankruptcy,\nurges that the timely objection requirement applies not\nonly to the debtor\u2019s designation of an asset as exempt; the\nrequirement applies as well, she asserts, to her estimate of\nthe asset\u2019s market value. That is so, she reasons, because\nthe asset\u2019s current dollar value is critical to the determi\u00ad\nnation whether she may keep the property intact and\noutside bankruptcy, or whether the trustee, at any time\nduring the course of the proceedings, may sell it.\n   The Court holds that challenges to the debtor\u2019s valua\u00ad\ntion of exemptible assets need not be made within the 30\u00ad\n2                    SCHWAB v.

Instead, according to\nthe Court, no time limit constrains the trustee\u2019s (or a\ncreditor\u2019s) prerogative to place at issue the debtor\u2019s\nevaluation of the property as fully exempt.\n  The Court\u2019s decision drastically reduces Rule 4003\u2019s\ngovernance, for challenges to valuation have been, until\ntoday, the most common type of objection leveled against\nexemption claims.

In\naccord with the courts below, I would hold that a debtor\u2019s\nvaluation of exempt property counts and becomes conclu\u00ad\nsive absent a timely objection.\n                              I\n  Nadejda Reilly is a cook who operated a one-person\ncatering business. Unable to cover her debts, she filed a\nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition appending all required\nschedules and statements. Relevant here, her filings\nincluded a form captioned \u201cSchedule B - Personal Prop\u00ad\nerty,\u201d which called for enumeration of \u201call personal prop\u00ad\nerty of the debtor of whatever kind.\u201d App. 40a. On that\nall-encompassing schedule, Reilly listed \u201cbusiness equip\u00ad\nment,\u201d i.e., her kitchen equipment, with a current market\nvalue of $10,718. Id., at 49a.\n  Reilly also filed the more particular form captioned\n\u201cSchedule C - Property Claimed as Exempt.\u201d Id., at 56a.\nSchedule C contained four columns, the first headed \u201cDe\u00ad\nscription of Property\u201d; the second, \u201cSpecify Law Providing\nEach Exemption\u201d; the third, \u201cValue of Claimed Exemp\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

In the first\ncolumn of Schedule C, Reilly wrote, as she did in Schedule\nB\u2019s description-of-property column: \u201cSee attached list of\nbusiness equipment.\u201d Id., at 58a. On the list appended to\nSchedules B and C, Reilly set out by hand a 31-item inven\u00ad\ntory of her restaurant-plus-catering-venture equipment.\nNext to each item, e.g., \u201cDough Mixer,\u201d \u201cGas stove,\u201d\n\u201cHood,\u201d she specified, first, the purchase price and, next,\n\u201cToday\u2019s Market Value,\u201d which added up to $10,718 for the\nentire inventory. Id., at 51a\u201355a.1\n   As the laws securing exemption of her kitchen equip\u00ad\nment, Reilly specified in the second Schedule C column,\n\u00a7552(d)(6), the exemption covering trade tools, and\n\u00a7552(d)(5), the \u201cwildcard\u201d exemption. Id., at 58a.2 In the\nvalue-of-claimed-exemption column, she listed $1,850,\nthen the maximum trade-tools exemption, and $8,868,\ndrawn from her wildcard exemption, amounts adding up\nto $10,718. Ibid. And in the fourth, current-market\u00ad\nvalue, column, she recorded $10,718, corresponding to the\ntotal market value she had set out in her inventory and\nreported in Schedule B. Ibid.\n   Before the 30-day clock on filing objections had begun to\nrun, an appraiser told Schwab that Reilly\u2019s equipment was\nworth at least $17,000. Brief for Petitioner 15; App. 164a.\nNevertheless, Schwab did not object to the $10,718 market\nvalue Reilly attributed to her business equipment in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Reilly\u2019s Schedules B and C, and the inventory she attached to the\n\nforms, are reproduced in an Appendix to this opinion.\n  2 Unlike exemptions that describe the specific property debtors may\n\npreserve, e.g., 11 U.

REILLY\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nSchedule C and the attached inventory. Instead, he al\u00ad\nlowed the limitations period to lapse and then moved,\nunsuccessfully, for permission to sell the equipment at\nauction. Id., at 141a\u2013143a.3\n   From Reilly\u2019s filings, the Bankruptcy Judge found it\nevident that Reilly had claimed the property itself, not its\ndollar value, as exempt. Id., at 168a\u2013169a (\u201cI know there\u2019s\nan argument . . . that . . . the property identified as exempt\nis really the [valuation] column, [i.e., $10,718,] but that\u2019s\nnot what the forms say. The forms say property declared\nas exempt and to see attached list. So, they\u2019re exempting\nall the property. . . . If the Trustee believes that . . . all the\nproperty cannot be exempt, [he] should object to it.\u201d).\n   The District Court and Court of Appeals similarly con\u00ad\ncluded that, by listing the identical amount, $10,718, as\nthe property\u2019s market value and the value of the claimed\nexemptions, Reilly had signaled her intention to safeguard\nall of her kitchen equipment from inclusion in the bank\u00ad\nruptcy estate. In re Reilly, 403 B. R. 336, 338\u2013339 (MD\nPa. 2006); In re Reilly, 534 F. 3d 173, 178 (CA3 2008).\nBoth courts looked to \u00a7522(l) and Federal Rule of Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Procedure 4003(b), which state, respectively:\n        \u201cThe debtor shall file a list of property that the\n     debtor claims as exempt . . . . Unless a party in inter\u00ad\n     est objects, the property claimed as exempt on such\n     list is exempt.\u201d \u00a7522(l).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Schwab informed Reilly at the meeting of creditors that he planned\n\nto sell all of her business equipment. App. 137a. She promptly moved\nto dismiss her bankruptcy petition, stating that her \u201cbusiness equip\u00ad\nment . . . is necessary to her livelihood and art, and was a gift to her\nfrom her parents.\u201d Id., at 138a. She \u201cd[id] not desire to continue with\nthe bankruptcy,\u201d she added, because \u201cshe wishe[d] to continue in\nrestaurant and catering as her occupation.\u201d Ibid. The Bankruptcy\nCourt denied Reilly\u2019s dismissal motion simultaneously with Schwab\u2019s\nmotion to sell Reilly\u2019s equipment. Id., at 149a\u2013170a.\n                    Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                 5\n\n                      GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n     \u201cA party in interest may file an objection to the list of\n     property claimed as exempt only within 30 days after\n     the meeting of creditors held under \u00a7341(a) is con\u00ad\n     cluded . . . . The court may, for cause, extend the time\n     for filing objections if, before the time to object ex\u00ad\n     pires, a party in interest files a request for an exten\u00ad\n     sion.\u201d Rule 4003(b).4\n  Schwab having filed no objection within the allowable\n30 days, each of the tribunals below ruled that the entire\ninventory of Reilly\u2019s business equipment qualified as\nexempt in full. App. 168a; 403 B. R., at 339; 534 F. 3d, at\n178. The leading treatise on bankruptcy, the Court of\nAppeals noted, id., at 180, n. 4, is in accord:\n       \u201cNormally, if the debtor lists property as exempt,\n     that listing is interpreted as a claim for exemption of\n     the debtor\u2019s entire interest in the property, and the\n     debtor\u2019s valuation of that interest is treated as the\n     amount of the exemption claimed. Were it other\u00ad\n     wise\u2014that is, if the listing were construed to claim as\n     exempt only that portion of the property having the\n     value stated\u2014the provisions finalizing exemptions if\n     no objections are filed would be rendered meaningless.\n     The trustee or creditors could [anytime] claim that the\n     debtor\u2019s interest in the property was greater than the\n     value claimed as exempt and [then] object to the\n     debtor exempting his or her entire interest in the\n     property after the deadline for objections had passed.\u201d\n     9 Collier \u00b64003.02[1], pp. 4003\u20134 to 4003\u20135.\n  Agreeing with the courts below, I would hold that Reilly,\nby her precise identification of the exempt property, and\nher specification of $10,718 as both the current market\nvalue of her kitchen equipment and the value of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In 2008, this prescription was recodified without material change\n\nand designated Rule 4003(b)(1).\n6                    SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nclaimed exemptions, had made her position plain: She\nclaimed as exempt the listed property itself\u2014not the\ndollar amount, up to $10,718, that sale of the property by\nSchwab might yield. Because neither Schwab nor any\ncreditor lodged a timely objection, the listed property\nbecame exempt, reclaimed as property of the debtor, and\ntherefore outside the bankruptcy estate the trustee is\ncharged to administer.\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   Pursuant to \u00a7522(l), Reilly filed a list of property she\nclaimed as exempt from the estate-in-bankruptcy. Her\nfiling left no doubt that her exemption claim encompassed\nher entire inventory of kitchen equipment. Schwab, in\nfact, was fully aware of the nature of the claim Reilly\nasserted. At the meeting of creditors, Reilly reiterated\nthat she sought to keep the equipment in her possession;\nshe would rather discontinue the bankruptcy proceeding,\nshe made plain, than lose her equipment. See supra, at 4,\nn. 3. Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) requires the trustee, if he\ncontests the debtor\u2019s exemption claim in whole or part, to\nfile an objection within 30 days after the meeting of credi\u00ad\ntors. Absent a timely objection, \u201cthe property claimed as\nexempt . . . is exempt.\u201d \u00a7522(l); Rule 4003. That prescrip\u00ad\ntion should be dispositive of this case.\n   The Court holds, however, that Schwab was not obliged\nto file a timely objection to the exemption Reilly claimed,\nand indeed could auction off her cooking equipment any\u00ad\ntime prior to her discharge. In so holding, the Court de\u00ad\ncrees that no objection need be made to a debtor\u2019s valua\u00ad\ntion of her property.\n   To support the conclusion that Rule 4003\u2019s timely objec\u00ad\ntion requirement does not encompass the debtor\u2019s estima\u00ad\ntion of her property\u2019s market value, the Court homes in on\nthe language of exemption prescriptions that are subject to\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     7\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\na monetary cap.5 Those prescriptions, the Court points\nout, \u201cdefine the \u2018property\u2019 a debtor may \u2018clai[m] as exempt\u2019\nas the debtor\u2019s \u2018interest\u2019\u2014up to a specified dollar\namount\u2014in the assets described in the category, not as\nthe assets themselves.\u201d Ante, at 10. So long as a debtor\nvalues her claimed exemption at a dollar amount below\nthe statutory cap, the Court reasons, the claim is on-its\u00ad\nface permissible no matter the market value she ascribes\nto the asset. To evaluate the propriety of Reilly\u2019s declared\n\u201cinterest\u201d in her kitchen equipment, the Court concludes,\nSchwab was obliged promptly to inspect \u201cthree, and only\nthree, entries on Reilly\u2019s Schedule C: the description of the\nbusiness equipment . . . ; the Code provisions governing\nthe claimed exemptions; and the amounts Reilly listed in\nthe column titled \u2018value of claimed exemption.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n12\u201313.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Section 522(d) catalogs exemptions of two types. Most exemptions\u2014\n\nand all of those Reilly invoked\u2014place a monetary limit on the value of\nthe property the debtor may reclaim. See, e.g., \u00a7522(d)(2) (\u201cmotor\nvehicle\u201d); \u00a7522(d)(3) (\u201chousehold furnishings, household goods, wearing\napparel, appliances, books, animals, crops, or musical instruments\u201d);\n\u00a7522(d)(4) (\u201cjewelry\u201d). For certain exemptions not at issue here, the\nBankruptcy Code authorizes reclamation of the property in full without\nany cap on value. See, e.g., \u00a7522(d)(7) (\u201cunmatured life insurance\ncontract\u201d); \u00a7522(d)(9) (\u201c[p]rofessionally prescribed health aids\u201d);\n\u00a7522(d)(11)(A) (\u201caward under a crime victim\u2019s reparation law\u201d).\n  6 In support of its view that market value is not relevant to determin\u00ad\n\ning the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt\u201d for purposes of Rule 4003(b)\u2019s\ntimely objection mandate, the Court observes that Schedule C did not\nrequire the debtor to list this information until 1991. Ante, at 14\u201315.\nPrior to 1991, however, debtors recorded market value on a different\nschedule. See Interim Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 6, Sched\u00ad\nule B\u20132 (1979) (requiring debtor to list the \u201c[m]arket value of [her]\ninterest [in personal property] without deduction for . . . exemptions\nclaimed\u201d). Trustees assessing the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d\ntherefore, have always been able, from the face of the debtor\u2019s filings, to\ncompare the value of the claimed exemption to the property\u2019s declared\nmarket value. See Brief for National Association of Consumer Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 34.\n8                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              B\n   The Court\u2019s account, however, shuts from sight the vital\npart played by the fourth entry on Schedule C\u2014current\nmarket value\u2014when a capped exemption is claimed. A\ndebtor who estimates a market value below the cap, and\nlists an identical amount as the value of her claimed ex\u00ad\nemption, thereby signals that her aim is to keep the listed\nproperty in her possession, outside the estate-in\u00ad\nbankruptcy. In contrast, a debtor who estimates a market\nvalue above the cap, and above the value of her claimed\nexemption, thereby recognizes that she cannot shelter the\nproperty itself and that the trustee may seek to sell it for\nwhatever it is worth.7 Schedule C\u2019s final column, in other\nwords, alerts the trustee whether the debtor is claiming a\nright to retain the listed property itself as her own, a right\nsecured to her if the trustee files no timely objection.8\n   Because an asset\u2019s market value is key to determining\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 By authorizing exemption of assets that a debtor would want to\n\nkeep in kind, such as her jewelry and car, but limiting the exemptible\nvalue of this property, Congress struck a balance between debtors\u2019\nand creditors\u2019 interests: Debtors can reclaim items helpful to their\nfresh start after bankruptcy, but only if those items are of modest\nvalue. Assets of larger worth, however, are subject to liquidation so\nthat creditors may obtain a portion of the item\u2019s value. Cf. In re Price,\n370 F. 3d 362, 378 (CA3 2004) (\u201c[B]ankruptcy law is bilateral, replete\nwith protections and policy considerations favoring both debtors and\ncreditors.\u201d).\n   8 The significance of market value is what differentiates capped ex\u00ad\n\nemptions from uncapped ones that permit debtors to exempt certain\nproperty in kind regardless of its worth. See supra, at 7, n. 5. For\nuncapped exemptions, the nature of the property the debtor has re\u00ad\nclaimed is clear: If the exemption is valid, the debtor gets the asset in\nfull every time. For capped exemptions, however, market value is a\ncrucial component in determining whether the debtor gets the item\nitself or a sum of money representing a share of the item\u2019s liquidation\nvalue. Reading Bankruptcy Rule 4003(b) to require objections to\nvaluation thus does not, as the Court contends, \u201celid[e] the distinction\u201d\nbetween capped and uncapped exemptions, ante, at 12 (emphasis\nadded), but instead accounts for that distinction.\n                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                       9\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe character of the interest the debtor is asserting in that\nasset, Rule 4003(b) is properly read to require objections to\nvaluation within 30 days, just as the Rule requires timely\nobjections to the debtor\u2019s description of the property, the\nasserted legal basis for the exemption, and the claimed\nvalue of the exemption. See 4 Collier \u00b6522.05[1], p. 522\u2013\n28 (rev. 15th ed. 2005) (\u201c[T]o evaluate the propriety of the\ndebtor\u2019s claim of exemption,\u201d trustees need the informa\u00ad\ntion in all four columns of Schedule C; \u201c[market] value\u201d is\n\u201cessential\u201d to judging whether the claim is proper because\n\u201c[e]xemption provisions often are limited according to . . .\n[the property\u2019s] value.\u201d). 9\n                            C\n  Requiring objections to market valuation notably facili\u00ad\ntates the debtor\u2019s fresh start, and thus best fulfills the\nprime purpose of the exemption prescriptions. See, e.g.,\nBurlingham v. Crouse, 228 U. S. 459, 473 (1913) (Bank\u00ad\nruptcy provisions \u201cmust be construed\u201d in light of policy \u201cto\ngive the bankrupt a fresh start.\u201d). See also Rousey v.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Suggesting   that this interpretation of Rule 4003(b) \u201clacks statutory\nsupport,\u201d ante, at 13, n. 11, the Court repeatedly emphasizes that the\nBankruptcy Code defines the \u201cproperty claimed as exempt,\u201d to which a\ntrustee must object, as \u201cthe debtor\u2019s \u2018interest\u2019\u2014up to a specified dollar\namount\u2014in the assets described in [capped exemption] categor[ies],\u201d\nante, at 10; see, e.g., ante, at 11; ibid., n. 9; ante, at 21, n. 19. But the\ncommonly understood definition of a property \u201cinterest\u201d is \u201c[a] legal\nshare in something; all or part of a legal or equitable claim to or right\nin property. . . . Collectively, the word includes any aggregation of\n[such] rights.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 828 (8th ed. 2004). Schwab,\ntherefore, could not comprehend whether Reilly claimed a monetary or\nan in-kind \u201cinterest\u201d in her kitchen equipment without comparing her\nmarket valuation of the equipment to the value of her claimed exemp\u00ad\ntion. See supra, at 8\u20139. In line with the statutory text, a debtor\u2019s\nmarket valuation is an essential factor in determining the nature of the\n\u201cinterest\u201d a debtor lists as exempt. Bankruptcy \u201cforms, rules, treatise\nexcerpts, and policy considerations,\u201d ante, at 7, n. 5, corroborate, rather\nthan conflict with, this reading of the Code.\n10                        SCHWAB v.

As \u201cthere can be no possibility of further objection\nto the exemptions\u201d after this period elapses, the principal\nbankruptcy treatise observes, \u201cif the debtor is not yet in\npossession of the property claimed as exempt, it should be\nturned over to [her] at this time to effectuate fully the\nfresh start purpose of the exemptions.\u201d             9 Collier\n\u00b64003.03[3], p. 4003\u201313.\n   With the benefit of closure, and the certainty it brings,\nthe debtor may, at the end of the 30 days, plan for her\nfuture secure in the knowledge that the possessions she\nhas exempted in their entirety are hers to keep. See 534\nF. 3d, at 180. If she has reclaimed her car from the estate,\nfor example, she may accept a job not within walking\ndistance. See Brief for National Association of Consumer\nBankruptcy Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 2\u20133 (herein\u00ad\nafter NACBA Brief).

(\u201cIf the assets sought to be exempted by the\ndebtor were not valued at a date early in the bankruptcy\nproceeding, neither the debtor nor the creditors would\nknow who had the right to them.\u201d).\n                              III\n  The Court and Schwab raise three concerns about read\u00ad\ning Rule 4003 to require timely objection to the debtor\u2019s\nestimate of an exempt asset\u2019s market value: Would trus\u00ad\ntees face an untoward administrative burden? Would\ntrustees lack fair notice of the need to object? And would\ndebtors be tempted to undervalue their property in an\neffort to avoid the monetary cap on exemptions? In my\njudgment, all three questions should be answered no.\n                             A\n  The Court suggests that requiring timely objections to a\ndebtor\u2019s valuation of exempt property would saddle trus\u00ad\ntees with an unmanageable load. See ante, at 18 (declin\u00ad\ning to \u201cexpand . . . the universe of information an inter\u00ad\nested party must consider in evaluating the validity of a\nclaimed exemption\u201d). See also Brief for Petitioner 32\u201333;\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.12 But trus\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Money generated by liquidation of an asset will often be of less\n\nutility to a debtor, who will have to pay more to replace the item. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 95\u2013595, p. 127 (1977) (noting that \u201chousehold goods have\nlittle resale value\u201d but \u201creplacement costs of the goods are generally\nhigh\u201d).\n   12 This concern is questionable in light of the prevailing practice, for,\n\nas earlier noted, valuation objections are the most common Rule\n4003(b) challenge. See supra, at 2. By lopping off valuation disagree\u00ad\nments from the timely objection requirement, see, e.g., ante, at 10\u201311,\nn. 8, the Court so severely shrinks the Rule\u2019s realm that this question\n12                        SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntees, sooner or later, must attempt to ascertain the market\nvalue of exempted assets. They must do so to determine\nwhether sale of the items would likely produce surplus\nproceeds for the estate above the value of the claimed\nexemption, see \u00a7704(a)(1); the only question, then, is when\nthis market valuation must occur\u2014(1) within 30 days or\n(2) at any time before discharge? Removing valuation\nfrom Rule 4003\u2019s governance thus does little to reduce the\nlabors trustees must undertake.\n   The 30-day objection period, I note, does not impose on\ntrustees any additional duty, but rather guides the exer\u00ad\ncise of existing responsibilities; under Rule 4003(b), a\ntrustee must rank evaluation of the debtor\u2019s exemptions as\na priority item in his superintendence of the estate.13 And\nif the trustee entertains any doubt about the accuracy of a\ndebtor\u2019s estimation of market value, the procedure for\ninterposing objections is hardly arduous. The trustee need\nonly file with the court a simple declaration stating that\nan item\u2019s value exceeds the amount listed by the debtor.14\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\narises: Why are trustees granted a full 30 days to lodge objections?\nUnder the Court\u2019s reading of the Rule, trustees need only compare a\ndebtor\u2019s Schedule C to the text of the exemption prescriptions to assess\nan exemption claim\u2019s facial validity, with no further investigation\nnecessary. That comparison should take no more than minutes, surely\nnot a month.\n   13 Trustees, it bears noting, historically had valuation duties far more\n\nonerous than they have today. Rule 4003\u2019s predecessor required\ntrustees in the first instance, rather than debtors, to estimate the\nmarket value of property claimed as exempt. See Rule 403(b) (1975).\nTrustees had to provide this valuation to the court within 15 days of\ntheir appointment. See ibid.\n   14 The leading bankruptcy treatise supplies an illustrative valuation\n\nobjection:\n   \u201c[Name of Trustee], the duly qualified and acting trustee of the estate\nof the debtor, would show the court the following:\n   \u201c1. The debtor is not entitled under [the automobile exemption] to an\ninterest of more than $3,225 in an automobile. The automobile claimed\nby debtor as exempt . . . has a value substantially greater than $3,225.\n                        Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                13\n\n                          GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n    If the trustee needs more than 30 days to assess market\nvalue, moreover, the time period is eminently extendable.\nRule 4003(b) prescribes that a trustee may, for cause, ask\nthe court for an extension of the objection period. Alterna\u00ad\ntively, the trustee can postpone the conclusion of the\nmeeting of creditors, from which the 30-day clock runs,\nsimply by adjourning the meeting to a future date. Rule\n2003(e). A trustee also may examine the debtor under\noath at the creditors\u2019 meeting, Rule 2003(b)(1); if he gath\u00ad\ners information impugning her exemption claims, he may\nask the bankruptcy court to hold a hearing to determine\nvaluation issues, Rule 4003(c). See Taylor, 503 U. S., at\n644 (\u201cIf [the trustee] did not know the value of [a claimed\nexemption], he could have sought a hearing on the issue\n. . . or . . . asked the Bankruptcy Court for an extension of\ntime to object.\u201d). See also NACBA Brief 19, 21\u201323 (listing\nways trustees may enlarge the limitations period for\nobjections). Trustees, in sum, have ample mechanisms at\ntheir disposal to gain the time and information they need\nto lodge objections to valuation.\n                               B\n  On affording trustees fair notice of the need to object,\nthe Court emphasizes that a debtor must list her claimed\nexemptions \u201cin a manner that makes the scope of the\nexemption clear.\u201d Ante, at 20. If a debtor wishes to ex\u00ad\nempt property in its entirety, for example, the Court coun\u00ad\nsels her to write \u201cfull fair market value (FMV)\u201d or \u201c100% of\nFMV\u201d in Schedule C\u2019s value-of-claimed-exemption column.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    .               .                 .                  .        .\n  \u201cWHEREFORE Trustee prays that the court determine that debtor is\nnot entitled to . . . the exemptio[n] claimed by him, that the [property\nclaimed as exempt] which [is] disallowed be turned over to the trustee\nherein as property of the estate, and that he have such other and\nfurther relief as is just.\u201d 13A Collier \u00a7CS17.14, p.

REILLY\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 20\u201321 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\u20137, 26\u201329; In re Hyman, 967 F. 2d\n1316, 1319\u20131320, n. 6 (CA9 1992) (Trustees must be able\nto assess the validity of an exemption from the face of a\ndebtor\u2019s schedules.). Our decision in Taylor v. Freeland &\nKronz, the Court notes, is instructive. In Taylor, the\ndebtor recorded the term \u201c$ unknown\u201d as the value of a\nclaimed exemption, which, the Court observes, raised a\n\u201cwarning fla[g]\u201d because the value \u201cwas not plainly within\nthe limits the Code allows.\u201d Ante, at 17.\n   True, a debtor\u2019s schedules must give notice sufficient to\ncue the trustee that an objection may be in order. But a\n\u201cwarning flag\u201d is in the eye of the beholder: If a debtor\nlists identical amounts as the market value of exempted\nproperty and the value of her claimed exemption, she has,\non the face of her schedules, reclaimed the entire asset just\nas surely as if she had recorded \u201c100% of FMV\u201d in Sched\u00ad\nule C\u2019s value-of-claimed-exemption column. See Brief for\nRespondent 36. See also 9 Collier \u00b64003.03[3], p. 4003\u201314\n(\u201cOnly when a debtor\u2019s schedules specifically value the\ndebtor\u2019s interest in the property at an amount higher than\nthe amount claimed as exempt can it be argued that a part\nof the debtor\u2019s interest in property has not been ex\u00ad\nempted.\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   In this case, by specifying $10,718 as both the current\nmarket value of her kitchen equipment and the value of\nher claimed exemptions, Reilly gave notice that she had\nreclaimed the listed property in full. See supra, at 2\u20136.\nTo borrow the Court\u2019s terminology, Reilly waved a \u201cwarn\u00ad\ning flag\u201d that should have prompted Schwab to object if he\nbelieved the equipment could not be reclaimed in its en\u00ad\ntirety because its value exceeded the statutory cap. 534\nF. 3d, at 179. See 4 Collier \u00b6522.05[2][b], p. 522\u201333 (\u201cNor\u00ad\nmally, if a debtor lists an asset as having a particular\nvalue in the schedules and then exempts that value, the\nschedules should be read as a claim of exemption for the\n                      Cite as: 560 U.

As just noted, the\nCourt counsels debtors wishing to exempt an asset in full\nto write \u201c100% of FMV\u201d or \u201cfull FMV\u201d in the value-of\u00ad\nclaimed-exemption column. But a debtor following the\ninstructions that accompany Schedule C would consider\nsuch a response nonsensical, for those instructions direct\nher to \u201cstate the dollar value of the claimed exemption in\nthe space provided.\u201d Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form\n6, Schedule C, Instruction 5 (1991) (emphasis added).\nChapter 7 debtors are often unrepresented. How are they\nto know they must ignore Schedule C\u2019s instructions and\nemploy the \u201cwarning flag\u201d described today by the Court, if\nthey wish to trigger the trustee\u2019s obligation to object to\ntheir market valuation in a timely fashion? See In re\nAnderson, 377 B. R. 865, 875 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA6\n2007).15\n                              C\n  Schwab finally urges that requiring timely objections to\na debtor\u2019s market-value estimations \u201cwould give debtors a\nperverse incentive to game the system by undervaluing\ntheir assets.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35; see Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 27. The Court rejected an argu\u00ad\nment along these lines in Taylor, and should follow suit\nhere. Multiple measures, Taylor explained, discourage\nundervaluation of property claimed as exempt. 503 U. S.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 Trustees,  in contrast, are repeat players in bankruptcy court; if this\nCourt required timely objections to market valuation, trustees would,\nno doubt, modify their practices in response.               See 1 Collier\n\u00b68.06[1][c][ii], p. 8\u201375 (rev. 15th ed. 2009) (\u201cSince Taylor [v. Freeland &\nKronz, 503 U. S. 638 (1992)], trustees rarely fail to closely scrutinize\nvague exemption claims.\u201d). Moreover, because valuation objections are\nalready the norm, see supra, at 2, and 11, n. 12, few trustees would\nhave to adjust their behavior.\n16                   SCHWAB v. REILLY\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nat 644. Among those measures: The debtor files her\nexemption claim under penalty of perjury. See Rule\n1008. She risks judicial sanction for signing documents\nnot well grounded in fact. Rule 9011. And proof of fraud\nsubjects her to criminal prosecution, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7152;\nextends the limitations period for filing objections to\nSchedule C, Rule 4003(b); and authorizes denial of dis\u00ad\ncharge, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7727(a)(4)(B). See also NACBA Brief\n29\u201333 (detailing additional checks against inadequate or\ninaccurate filings).\n  Furthermore, the objection procedure is itself a safe\u00ad\nguard against debtor undervaluation. If a trustee sus\u00ad\npects that the market value of property claimed as exempt\nmay exceed a debtor\u2019s estimate, he should do just what\nRule 4003(b) prescribes: \u201c[F]ile an objection . . . within 30\ndays after the meeting of creditors.\u201d\n                      *    *    *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the Third Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s judgment.\n   Cite as: 560 U.
