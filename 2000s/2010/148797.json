Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U. S. 321, 337.\n\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n    CITY OF ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA, ET AL. v. QUON \n\n                      ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08\u20131332. Argued April 19, 2010\u2014Decided June 17, 2010\nPetitioner Ontario (hereinafter City) acquired alphanumeric pagers\n  able to send and receive text messages. Its contract with its service\n  provider, Arch Wireless, provided for a monthly limit on the number\n  of characters each pager could send or receive, and specified that us\n  age exceeding that number would result in an additional fee. The\n  City issued the pagers to respondent Quon and other officers in its\n  police department (OPD), also a petitioner here. When Quon and\n  others exceeded their monthly character limits for several months\n  running, petitioner Scharf, OPD\u2019s chief, sought to determine whether\n  the existing limit was too low, i.e., whether the officers had to pay\n  fees for sending work-related messages or, conversely, whether the\n  overages were for personal messages. After Arch Wireless provided\n  transcripts of Quon\u2019s and another employee\u2019s August and September\n  2002 text messages, it was discovered that many of Quon\u2019s messages\n  were not work related, and some were sexually explicit. Scharf re\n  ferred the matter to OPD\u2019s internal affairs division. The investigat\n  ing officer used Quon\u2019s work schedule to redact from his transcript\n  any messages he sent while off duty, but the transcript showed that\n  few of his on-duty messages related to police business. Quon was dis\n  ciplined for violating OPD rules.\n    He and the other respondents\u2014each of whom had exchanged text\n  messages with Quon during August and September\u2014filed this suit,\n  alleging, inter alia, that petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment\n  rights and the federal Stored Communications Act (SCA) by obtain\n  ing and reviewing the transcript of Quon\u2019s pager messages, and that\n  Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.\n  The District Court denied respondents summary judgment on the\n2                           ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    constitutional claims, relying on the plurality opinion in O\u2019Connor v.\n    Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, to determine that Quon had a reasonable ex\n    pectation of privacy in the content of his messages. Whether the au\n    dit was nonetheless reasonable, the court concluded, turned on\n    whether Scharf used it for the improper purpose of determining if\n    Quon was using his pager to waste time, or for the legitimate purpose\n    of determining the efficacy of existing character limits to ensure that\n    officers were not paying hidden work-related costs. After the jury\n    concluded that Scharf\u2019s intent was legitimate, the court granted peti\n    tioners summary judgment on the ground they did not violate the\n    Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Although it agreed\n    that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text mes\n    sages, the appeals court concluded that the search was not reason\n    able even though it was conducted on a legitimate, work-related ra\n    tionale. The opinion pointed to a host of means less intrusive than\n    the audit that Scharf could have used. The court further concluded\n    that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by giving the City the tran\n    script.\nHeld: Because the search of Quon\u2019s text messages was reasonable, peti\n tioners did not violate respondents\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights, and\n the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding otherwise. Pp. 7\u201317.\n    (a) The Amendment guarantees a person\u2019s privacy, dignity, and se\n curity against arbitrary and invasive governmental acts, without re\n gard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or per\n forming another function. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019\n Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 613\u2013614. It applies as well when the govern\n ment acts in its capacity as an employer. Treasury Employees v. Von\n Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665. The Members of the O\u2019Connor Court dis\n agreed on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment\n claims against government employers. A four-Justice plurality con\n cluded that the correct analysis has two steps. First, because \u201csome\n [government] offices may be so open . . . that no expectation of pri\n vacy is reasonable,\u201d a court must consider \u201c[t]he operational realities\n of the workplace\u201d to determine if an employee\u2019s constitutional rights\n are implicated. 480 U. S., at 718. Second, where an employee has a\n legitimate privacy expectation, an employer\u2019s intrusion on that ex\n pectation \u201cfor noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for\n investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the\n standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.\u201d Id., at 725\u2013\n 726. JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment, would have dis\n pensed with the \u201coperational realities\u201d inquiry and concluded \u201cthat\n the offices of government employees . . . are [generally] covered by\n Fourth Amendment protections,\u201d id., at 731, but he would also have\n held \u201cthat government searches to retrieve work-related materials or\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nto investigate violations of workplace rules\u2014searches of the sort that\nare regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer con\ntext\u2014do not violate the . . . Amendment,\u201d id., at 732. Pp. 7\u20139.\n   (b) Even assuming that Quon had a reasonable expectation of pri\nvacy in his text messages, the search was reasonable under both\nO\u2019Connor approaches, the plurality\u2019s and JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s. Pp. 9\u201317.\n     (1) The Court does not resolve the parties\u2019 disagreement over\nQuon\u2019s privacy expectation. Prudence counsels caution before the\nfacts in this case are used to establish far-reaching premises that de\nfine the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations of employees\nusing employer-provided communication devices. Rapid changes in\nthe dynamics of communication and information transmission are\nevident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as\nproper behavior. At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms,\nand the law\u2019s treatment of them, will evolve. Because it is therefore\npreferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds, the Court as\nsumes, arguendo, that: (1) Quon had a reasonable privacy expecta\ntion; (2) petitioners\u2019 review of the transcript constituted a Fourth\nAmendment search; and (3) the principles applicable to a government\nemployer\u2019s search of an employee\u2019s physical office apply as well in the\nelectronic sphere. Pp. 9\u201312.\n   (2) Petitioners\u2019 warrantless review of Quon\u2019s pager transcript was\nreasonable under the O\u2019Connor plurality\u2019s approach because it was\nmotivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was\nnot excessive in scope. See 480 U. S., at 726. There were \u201creasonable\ngrounds for [finding it] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related\npurpose,\u201d ibid., in that Chief Scharf had ordered the audit to deter\nmine whether the City\u2019s contractual character limit was sufficient to\nmeet the City\u2019s needs. It was also \u201creasonably related to the objec\ntives of the search,\u201d ibid., because both the City and OPD had a le\ngitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to\npay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or, on the\nother hand, that the City was not paying for extensive personal\ncommunications. Reviewing the transcripts was an efficient and ex\npedient way to determine whether either of these factors caused\nQuon\u2019s overages. And the review was also not \u201cexcessively intrusive.\u201d\nIbid. Although Quon had exceeded his monthly allotment a number\nof times, OPD requested transcripts for only August and September\n2002 in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide the character\nlimits\u2019 efficaciousness, and all the messages that Quon sent while off\nduty were redacted. And from OPD\u2019s perspective, the fact that Quon\nlikely had only a limited privacy expectation lessened the risk that\nthe review would intrude on highly private details of Quon\u2019s life.\nSimilarly, because the City had a legitimate reason for the search\n4                           ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    and it was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification, the\n    search would be \u201cregarded as reasonable and normal in the private\n    employer context\u201d and thereby satisfy the approach of JUSTICE\n    SCALIA\u2019s concurrence, id., at 732. Conversely, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n    \u201cleast intrusive\u201d means approach was inconsistent with controlling\n    precedents. See, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S.\n    646, 663. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (c) Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expecta\n    tion of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved.\n    They argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it\n    was also unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argu\n    ment that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be\n    unreasonable as to them. Given this litigating position and the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Quon, these\n    other respondents cannot prevail.

The employee\ncontends that the privacy of the messages is protected by\nthe ban on \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d found in\nthe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution,\nmade applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.         Mapp v. Ohio, 367\nU. S. 643 (1961). Though the case touches issues of far-\nreaching significance, the Court concludes it can be re\u00ad\nsolved by settled principles determining when a search is\nreasonable.\n                                          I\n                             A\n  The City of Ontario (City) is a political subdivision of the\nState of California. The case arose out of incidents in 2001\nand 2002 when respondent Jeff Quon was employed by the\nOntario Police Department (OPD). He was a police ser\u00ad\n2                     ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngeant and member of OPD\u2019s Special Weapons and Tactics\n(SWAT) Team. The City, OPD, and OPD\u2019s Chief, Lloyd\nScharf, are petitioners here. As will be discussed, two\nrespondents share the last name Quon. In this opinion\n\u201cQuon\u201d refers to Jeff Quon, for the relevant events mostly\nrevolve around him.\n  In October 2001, the City acquired 20 alphanumeric\npagers capable of sending and receiving text messages.\nArch Wireless Operating Company provided wireless\nservice for the pagers. Under the City\u2019s service contract\nwith Arch Wireless, each pager was allotted a limited\nnumber of characters sent or received each month. Usage\nin excess of that amount would result in an additional fee.\nThe City issued pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team\nmembers in order to help the SWAT Team mobilize and\nrespond to emergency situations.\n  Before acquiring the pagers, the City announced a\n\u201cComputer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy\u201d (Computer\nPolicy) that applied to all employees. Among other provi\u00ad\nsions, it specified that the City \u201creserves the right to moni\u00ad\ntor and log all network activity including e-mail and\nInternet use, with or without notice. Users should have no\nexpectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these\nresources.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. In March 2000,\nQuon signed a statement acknowledging that he had read\nand understood the Computer Policy.\n  The Computer Policy did not apply, on its face, to text\nmessaging. Text messages share similarities with e-mails,\nbut the two differ in an important way. In this case, for\ninstance, an e-mail sent on a City computer was transmit\u00ad\nted through the City\u2019s own data servers, but a text mes\u00ad\nsage sent on one of the City\u2019s pagers was transmitted\nusing wireless radio frequencies from an individual pager\nto a receiving station owned by Arch Wireless. It was\nrouted through Arch Wireless\u2019 computer network, where it\nremained until the recipient\u2019s pager or cellular telephone\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas ready to receive the message, at which point Arch\nWireless transmitted the message from the transmitting\nstation nearest to the recipient. After delivery, Arch\nWireless retained a copy on its computer servers. The\nmessage did not pass through computers owned by the\nCity.\n  Although the Computer Policy did not cover text mes\u00ad\nsages by its explicit terms, the City made clear to employ\u00ad\nees, including Quon, that the City would treat text mes\u00ad\nsages the same way as it treated e-mails. At an April 18,\n2002, staff meeting at which Quon was present, Lieuten\u00ad\nant Steven Duke, the OPD officer responsible for the City\u2019s\ncontract with Arch Wireless, told officers that messages\nsent on the pagers \u201care considered e-mail messages. This\nmeans that [text] messages would fall under the City\u2019s\npolicy as public information and [would be] eligible for\nauditing.\u201d App. 30. Duke\u2019s comments were put in writing\nin a memorandum sent on April 29, 2002, by Chief Scharf\nto Quon and other City personnel.\n  Within the first or second billing cycle after the pagers\nwere distributed, Quon exceeded his monthly text message\ncharacter allotment. Duke told Quon about the overage,\nand reminded him that messages sent on the pagers were\n\u201cconsidered e-mail and could be audited.\u201d Id., at 40. Duke\nsaid, however, that \u201cit was not his intent to audit [an]\nemployee\u2019s text messages to see if the overage [was] due to\nwork related transmissions.\u201d Ibid. Duke suggested that\nQuon could reimburse the City for the overage fee rather\nthan have Duke audit the messages. Quon wrote a check\nto the City for the overage. Duke offered the same ar\u00ad\nrangement to other employees who incurred overage fees.\n  Over the next few months, Quon exceeded his character\nlimit three or four times. Each time he reimbursed the\nCity. Quon and another officer again incurred overage\nfees for their pager usage in August 2002. At a meeting in\nOctober, Duke told Scharf that he had become \u201c \u2018tired of\n4                    ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeing a bill collector.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 91. Scharf decided to de\u00ad\ntermine whether the existing character limit was too\nlow\u2014that is, whether officers such as Quon were having to\npay fees for sending work-related messages\u2014or if the\noverages were for personal messages. Scharf told Duke to\nrequest transcripts of text messages sent in August and\nSeptember by Quon and the other employee who had\nexceeded the character allowance.\n  At Duke\u2019s request, an administrative assistant em\u00ad\nployed by OPD contacted Arch Wireless. After verifying\nthat the City was the subscriber on the accounts, Arch\nWireless provided the desired transcripts. Duke reviewed\nthe transcripts and discovered that many of the messages\nsent and received on Quon\u2019s pager were not work related,\nand some were sexually explicit. Duke reported his find\u00ad\nings to Scharf, who, along with Quon\u2019s immediate supervi\u00ad\nsor, reviewed the transcripts himself. After his review,\nScharf referred the matter to OPD\u2019s internal affairs divi\u00ad\nsion for an investigation into whether Quon was violating\nOPD rules by pursuing personal matters while on duty.\n  The officer in charge of the internal affairs review was\nSergeant Patrick McMahon. Before conducting a review,\nMcMahon used Quon\u2019s work schedule to redact the tran\u00ad\nscripts in order to eliminate any messages Quon sent\nwhile off duty. He then reviewed the content of the mes\u00ad\nsages Quon sent during work hours. McMahon\u2019s report\nnoted that Quon sent or received 456 messages during\nwork hours in the month of August 2002, of which no more\nthan 57 were work related; he sent as many as 80 mes\u00ad\nsages during a single day at work; and on an average\nworkday, Quon sent or received 28 messages, of which\nonly 3 were related to police business. The report con\u00ad\ncluded that Quon had violated OPD rules. Quon was\nallegedly disciplined.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

C. \u00a72701 et seq., popularly known as the\nStored Communications Act (SCA); and California law,\nQuon filed suit against petitioners in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of California. Arch\nWireless and an individual not relevant here were also\nnamed as defendants. Quon was joined in his suit by\nanother plaintiff who is not a party before this Court and\nby the other respondents, each of whom exchanged text\nmessages with Quon during August and September 2002:\nJerilyn Quon, Jeff Quon\u2019s then-wife, from whom he was\nseparated; April Florio, an OPD employee with whom Jeff\nQuon was romantically involved; and Steve Trujillo, an\u00ad\nother member of the OPD SWAT Team. Among the alle\u00ad\ngations in the complaint was that petitioners violated\nrespondents\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights and the SCA by\nobtaining and reviewing the transcript of Jeff Quon\u2019s\npager messages and that Arch Wireless had violated the\nSCA by turning over the transcript to the City.\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\nThe District Court granted Arch Wireless\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment on the SCA claim but denied petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the Fourth Amend\u00ad\nment claims. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 445\nF. Supp. 2d 1116 (CD Cal. 2006). Relying on the plural\u00ad\nity opinion in O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 711\n(1987), the District Court determined that Quon had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his text\nmessages. Whether the audit of the text messages was\nnonetheless reasonable, the District Court concluded,\nturned on Chief Scharf\u2019s intent: \u201c[I]f the purpose for the\naudit was to determine if Quon was using his pager to\n\u2018play games\u2019 and \u2018waste time,\u2019 then the audit was not\nconstitutionally reasonable\u201d; but if the audit\u2019s purpose\n\u201cwas to determine the efficacy of the existing character\n6                     ONTARIO v.

Supp. 2d, at 1146.\n   The District Court held a jury trial to determine the\npurpose of the audit. The jury concluded that Scharf\nordered the audit to determine the efficacy of the charac\u00ad\nter limits. The District Court accordingly held that peti\u00ad\ntioners did not violate the Fourth Amendment. It entered\njudgment in their favor.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\u00ad\ncuit reversed in part. 529 F. 3d 892 (2008). The panel\nagreed with the District Court that Jeff Quon had a rea\u00ad\nsonable expectation of privacy in his text messages but\ndisagreed with the District Court about whether the\nsearch was reasonable.

(quoting same).\n   The O\u2019Connor Court did disagree on the proper analyti\u00ad\ncal framework for Fourth Amendment claims against\ngovernment employers. A four-Justice plurality concluded\nthat the correct analysis has two steps. First, because\n\u201csome government offices may be so open to fellow em\u00ad\nployees or the public that no expectation of privacy is\nreasonable,\u201d id., at 718, a court must consider \u201c[t]he opera\u00ad\ntional realities of the workplace\u201d in order to determine\nwhether an employee\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights are\nimplicated, id., at 717. On this view, \u201cthe question\nwhether an employee has a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Id., at\n718. Next, where an employee has a legitimate privacy\nexpectation, an employer\u2019s intrusion on that expectation\n\u201cfor noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as\nfor investigations of work-related misconduct, should be\njudged by the standard of reasonableness under all the\ncircumstances.\u201d Id., at 725\u2013726.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment, outlined a\ndifferent approach. His opinion would have dispensed\nwith an inquiry into \u201coperational realities\u201d and would\nconclude \u201cthat the offices of government employees . . . are\ncovered by Fourth Amendment protections as a general\nmatter.\u201d Id., at 731. But he would also have held \u201cthat\ngovernment searches to retrieve work-related materials or\nto investigate violations of workplace rules\u2014searches of\nthe sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the\nprivate-employer context\u2014do not violate the Fourth\nAmendment.\u201d Id., at 732.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Later, in the Von Raab decision, the Court explained\nthat \u201coperational realities\u201d could diminish an employee\u2019s\nprivacy expectations, and that this diminution could be\ntaken into consideration when assessing the reasonable\u00ad\nness of a workplace search. 489 U. S., at 671. In the two\ndecades since O\u2019Connor, however, the threshold test for\ndetermining the scope of an employee\u2019s Fourth Amend\u00ad\nment rights has not been clarified further. Here, though\nthey disagree on whether Quon had a reasonable expecta\u00ad\ntion of privacy, both petitioners and respondents start\nfrom the premise that the O\u2019Connor plurality controls.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 22\u201328; Brief for Respondents 25\u2013\n32. It is not necessary to resolve whether that premise is\ncorrect. The case can be decided by determining that the\nsearch was reasonable even assuming Quon had a reason\u00ad\nable expectation of privacy.      The two O\u2019Connor ap\u00ad\nproaches\u2014the plurality\u2019s and JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\u2014therefore\nlead to the same result here.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  Before turning to the reasonableness of the search, it is\ninstructive to note the parties\u2019 disagreement over whether\nQuon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The record\ndoes establish that OPD, at the outset, made it clear that\npager messages were not considered private. The City\u2019s\nComputer Policy stated that \u201c[u]sers should have no ex\u00ad\npectation of privacy or confidentiality when using\u201d City\ncomputers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. Chief Scharf\u2019s\nmemo and Duke\u2019s statements made clear that this official\npolicy extended to text messaging. The disagreement, at\nleast as respondents see the case, is over whether Duke\u2019s\nlater statements overrode the official policy. Respondents\ncontend that because Duke told Quon that an audit would\nbe unnecessary if Quon paid for the overage, Quon rea\u00ad\nsonably could expect that the contents of his messages\n10                   ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould remain private.\n   At this point, were we to assume that inquiry into \u201cop\u00ad\nerational realities\u201d were called for, compare O\u2019Connor, 480\nU. S., at 717 (plurality opinion), with id., at 730\u2013731\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.); see also id., at 737\u2013738 (Blackmun,\nJ., dissenting), it would be necessary to ask whether\nDuke\u2019s statements could be taken as announcing a change\nin OPD policy, and if so, whether he had, in fact or ap\u00ad\npearance, the authority to make such a change and to\nguarantee the privacy of text messaging. It would also be\nnecessary to consider whether a review of messages sent\non police pagers, particularly those sent while officers are\non duty, might be justified for other reasons, including\nperformance evaluations, litigation concerning the lawful\u00ad\nness of police actions, and perhaps compliance with state\nopen records laws. See Brief for Petitioners 35\u201340 (citing\nCal. Public Records Act, Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a76250 et seq.\n(West 2008)). These matters would all bear on the legiti\u00ad\nmacy of an employee\u2019s privacy expectation.\n   The Court must proceed with care when considering the\nwhole concept of privacy expectations in communications\nmade on electronic equipment owned by a government\nemployer. The judiciary risks error by elaborating too\nfully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging\ntechnology before its role in society has become clear. See,\ne.g., Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928),\noverruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 353\n(1967). In Katz, the Court relied on its own knowledge\nand experience to conclude that there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in a telephone booth. See id., at\n360\u2013361 (Harlan, J., concurring). It is not so clear that\ncourts at present are on so sure a ground. Prudence coun\u00ad\nsels caution before the facts in the instant case are used to\nestablish far-reaching premises that define the existence,\nand extent, of privacy expectations enjoyed by employees\nwhen using employer-provided communication devices.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and\ninformation transmission are evident not just in the tech\u00ad\nnology itself but in what society accepts as proper behav\u00ad\nior. As one amici brief notes, many employers expect or at\nleast tolerate personal use of such equipment by employ\u00ad\nees because it often increases worker efficiency. See Brief\nfor Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. 16\u201320. Another\namicus points out that the law is beginning to respond to\nthese developments, as some States have recently passed\nstatutes requiring employers to notify employees when\nmonitoring their electronic communications. See Brief for\nNew York Intellectual Property Law Association 22 (citing\nDel. Code Ann., Tit. 19, \u00a7705 (2005); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a731\u201348d (West 2003)). At present, it is uncertain how\nworkplace norms, and the law\u2019s treatment of them, will\nevolve.\n   Even if the Court were certain that the O\u2019Connor plural\u00ad\nity\u2019s approach were the right one, the Court would have\ndifficulty predicting how employees\u2019 privacy expectations\nwill be shaped by those changes or the degree to which\nsociety will be prepared to recognize those expectations as\nreasonable. See 480 U. S., at 715. Cell phone and text\nmessage communications are so pervasive that some\npersons may consider them to be essential means or nec\u00ad\nessary instruments for self-expression, even self\u00ad\nidentification. That might strengthen the case for an\nexpectation of privacy. On the other hand, the ubiquity of\nthose devices has made them generally affordable, so one\ncould counter that employees who need cell phones or\nsimilar devices for personal matters can purchase and pay\nfor their own. And employer policies concerning commu\u00ad\nnications will of course shape the reasonable expectations\nof their employees, especially to the extent that such\npolicies are clearly communicated.\n   A broad holding concerning employees\u2019 privacy expecta\u00ad\ntions vis-\u00e0-vis employer-provided technological equipment\n12                   ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmight have implications for future cases that cannot be\npredicted. It is preferable to dispose of this case on nar\u00ad\nrower grounds. For present purposes we assume several\npropositions arguendo: First, Quon had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the text messages sent on the\npager provided to him by the City; second, petitioners\u2019\nreview of the transcript constituted a search within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment; and third, the princi\u00ad\nples applicable to a government employer\u2019s search of an\nemployee\u2019s physical office apply with at least the same\nforce when the employer intrudes on the employee\u2019s pri\u00ad\nvacy in the electronic sphere.\n                               B\n   Even if Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in\nhis text messages, petitioners did not necessarily violate\nthe Fourth Amendment by obtaining and reviewing the\ntranscripts. Although as a general matter, warrantless\nsearches \u201care per se unreasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment,\u201d there are \u201ca few specifically established and\nwell-delineated exceptions\u201d to that general rule. Katz,\nsupra, at 357. The Court has held that the \u201c \u2018special\nneeds\u2019 \u201d of the workplace justify one such exception.\nO\u2019Connor, 480 U.

S., at 725\u2013\n726. The search here satisfied the standard of the\nO\u2019Connor plurality and was reasonable under that ap\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproach.\n  The search was justified at its inception because there\nwere \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting that the search\n[was] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related pur\u00ad\npose.\u201d Id., at 726. As a jury found, Chief Scharf ordered\nthe search in order to determine whether the character\nlimit on the City\u2019s contract with Arch Wireless was suffi\u00ad\ncient to meet the City\u2019s needs. This was, as the Ninth\nCircuit noted, a \u201clegitimate work-related rationale.\u201d 529\nF. 3d, at 908. The City and OPD had a legitimate interest\nin ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay\nout of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or on\nthe other hand that the City was not paying for extensive\npersonal communications.\n  As for the scope of the search, reviewing the transcripts\nwas reasonable because it was an efficient and expedient\nway to determine whether Quon\u2019s overages were the result\nof work-related messaging or personal use. The review\nwas also not \u201c \u2018excessively intrusive.\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Connor, supra, at\n726 (plurality opinion). Although Quon had gone over his\nmonthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested\ntranscripts for only the months of August and September\n2002. While it may have been reasonable as well for OPD\nto review transcripts of all the months in which Quon\nexceeded his allowance, it was certainly reasonable for\nOPD to review messages for just two months in order to\nobtain a large enough sample to decide whether the char\u00ad\nacter limits were efficacious. And it is worth noting that\nduring his internal affairs investigation, McMahon re\u00ad\ndacted all messages Quon sent while off duty, a measure\nwhich reduced the intrusiveness of any further review of\nthe transcripts.\n  Furthermore, and again on the assumption that Quon\nhad a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of\nhis messages, the extent of an expectation is relevant to\nassessing whether the search was too intrusive. See Von\n14                    ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRaab, supra, at 671; cf. Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Ac\nton, 515 U. S. 646, 654\u2013657 (1995). Even if he could as\u00ad\nsume some level of privacy would inhere in his messages,\nit would not have been reasonable for Quon to conclude\nthat his messages were in all circumstances immune from\nscrutiny. Quon was told that his messages were subject to\nauditing. As a law enforcement officer, he would or should\nhave known that his actions were likely to come under\nlegal scrutiny, and that this might entail an analysis of his\non-the-job communications. Under the circumstances, a\nreasonable employee would be aware that sound manage\u00ad\nment principles might require the audit of messages to\ndetermine whether the pager was being appropriately\nused. Given that the City issued the pagers to Quon and\nother SWAT Team members in order to help them more\nquickly respond to crises\u2014and given that Quon had re\u00ad\nceived no assurances of privacy\u2014Quon could have antici\u00ad\npated that it might be necessary for the City to audit\npager messages to assess the SWAT Team\u2019s performance\nin particular emergency situations.\n   From OPD\u2019s perspective, the fact that Quon likely had\nonly a limited privacy expectation, with boundaries that\nwe need not here explore, lessened the risk that the review\nwould intrude on highly private details of Quon\u2019s life.\nOPD\u2019s audit of messages on Quon\u2019s employer-provided\npager was not nearly as intrusive as a search of his per\u00ad\nsonal e-mail account or pager, or a wiretap on his home\nphone line, would have been. That the search did reveal\nintimate details of Quon\u2019s life does not make it unreason\u00ad\nable, for under the circumstances a reasonable employer\nwould not expect that such a review would intrude on such\nmatters. The search was permissible in its scope.\n   The Court of Appeals erred in finding the search unrea\u00ad\nsonable. It pointed to a \u201chost of simple ways to verify the\nefficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding\non [respondents\u2019] Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d 529 F. 3d,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 909. The panel suggested that Scharf \u201ccould have\nwarned Quon that for the month of September he was\nforbidden from using his pager for personal communica\u00ad\ntions, and that the contents of all his messages would be\nreviewed to ensure the pager was used only for work\u00ad\nrelated purposes during that time frame. Alternatively, if\n[OPD] wanted to review past usage, it could have asked\nQuon to count the characters himself, or asked him to\nredact personal messages and grant permission to [OPD]\nto review the redacted transcript.\u201d Ibid.\n   This approach was inconsistent with controlling prece\u00ad\ndents. This Court has \u201crepeatedly refused to declare that\nonly the \u2018least intrusive\u2019 search practicable can be reason\u00ad\nable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Vernonia, supra, at\n663; see also, e.g., Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist.\nNo. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 837\n(2002); Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, 647 (1983).\nThat rationale \u201ccould raise insuperable barriers to the\nexercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers,\u201d\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 557, n. 12\n(1976), because \u201cjudges engaged in post hoc evaluations of\ngovernment conduct can almost always imagine some\nalternative means by which the objectives of the govern\u00ad\nment might have been accomplished,\u201d Skinner, 489 U. S.,\nat 629, n. 9 (internal quotation marks and brackets omit\u00ad\nted). The analytic errors of the Court of Appeals in this\ncase illustrate the necessity of this principle. Even assum\u00ad\ning there were ways that OPD could have performed the\nsearch that would have been less intrusive, it does not\nfollow that the search as conducted was unreasonable.\n   Respondents argue that the search was per se unrea\u00ad\nsonable in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that\nArch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the\ntranscripts of Quon\u2019s text messages. The merits of the\nSCA claim are not before us. But even if the Court of\nAppeals was correct to conclude that the SCA forbade\n16                   ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArch Wireless from turning over the transcripts, it does\nnot follow that petitioners\u2019 actions were unreasonable.\nRespondents point to no authority for the proposition that\nthe existence of statutory protection renders a search per\nse unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. And the\nprecedents counsel otherwise. See Virginia v. Moore, 553\nU. S. 164, 168 (2008) (search incident to an arrest that\nwas illegal under state law was reasonable); California v.\nGreenwood, 486 U. S. 35, 43 (1988) (rejecting argument\nthat if state law forbade police search of individual\u2019s gar\u00ad\nbage the search would violate the Fourth Amendment).\nFurthermore, respondents do not maintain that any OPD\nemployee either violated the law him- or herself or knew\nor should have known that Arch Wireless, by turning over\nthe transcript, would have violated the law. The other\u00ad\nwise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreason\u00ad\nable by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the\nSCA by turning over the transcripts.\n  Because the search was motivated by a legitimate work\u00ad\nrelated purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope,\nthe search was reasonable under the approach of the\nO\u2019Connor plurality. 480 U. S., at 726. For these same\nreasons\u2014that the employer had a legitimate reason for\nthe search, and that the search was not excessively intru\u00ad\nsive in light of that justification\u2014the Court also concludes\nthat the search would be \u201cregarded as reasonable and\nnormal in the private-employer context\u201d and would satisfy\nthe approach of JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence.

It is not necessary to\nresolve this question in order to dispose of the case, how\u00ad\never.

Or\ntega, 480 U. S. 709 (1987), provides the correct approach to\ndetermining an employee\u2019s reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. See ante, at 9. Justice Blackmun, writing for the\nfour dissenting Justices in O\u2019Connor, agreed with JUSTICE\nSCALIA that an employee enjoys a reasonable expectation\nof privacy in his office. 480 U. S., at 737. But he advo\ncated a third approach to the reasonable expectation of\nprivacy inquiry, separate from those proposed by the\nO\u2019Connor plurality and by JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 8.\nRecognizing that it is particularly important to safeguard\n\u201ca public employee\u2019s expectation of privacy in the work\nplace\u201d in light of the \u201creality of work in modern time,\u201d 480\nU. S., at 739, which lacks \u201ctidy distinctions\u201d between\nworkplace and private activities, ibid., Justice Blackmun\nargued that \u201cthe precise extent of an employee\u2019s expecta\ntion of privacy often turns on the nature of the search,\u201d id.,\nat 738. And he emphasized that courts should determine\nthis expectation in light of the specific facts of each par\nticular search, rather than by announcing a categorical\nstandard. See id., at 741.\n   For the reasons stated at page 13 of the Court\u2019s opinion,\n2                         ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                         STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nit is clear that respondent Jeff Quon, as a law enforcement\nofficer who served on a SWAT Team, should have under\nstood that all of his work-related actions\u2014including all of\nhis communications on his official pager\u2014were likely to be\nsubject to public and legal scrutiny. He therefore had only\na limited expectation of privacy in relation to this particu\nlar audit of his pager messages. Whether one applies the\nreasoning from Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion, JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s concurrence, or Justice Blackmun\u2019s dissent* in\nO\u2019Connor, the result is the same: The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals in this case must be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * I do not contend that Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion is controlling un\nder Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), but neither is his\napproach to evaluating a reasonable expectation of privacy foreclosed\nby O\u2019Connor. Indeed, his approach to that inquiry led to the conclusion,\nshared by JUSTICE SCALIA but not adopted by the O\u2019Connor plurality,\nthat an employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office.\nSee O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 718 (1987) (plurality opinion).\nBut Justice Blackmun would have applied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\nwarrant and probable-cause requirements to workplace investigatory\nsearches, id., at 732 (dissenting opinion), whereas a majority of the\nCourt rejected that view, see id., at 722, 725 (plurality opinion); id., at\n732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). It was that analysis\u2014\nregarding the proper standard for evaluating a search when an em\nployee has a reasonable expectation of privacy\u2014that produced the\nopposite result in the case. This case does not implicate that debate\nbecause it does not involve an investigatory search. The jury concluded\nthat the purpose of the audit was to determine whether the character\nlimits were sufficient for work-related messages. See ante, at 6.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

I con\ntinue to believe that the \u201coperational realities\u201d rubric for\ndetermining the Fourth Amendment\u2019s application to pub\nlic employees invented by the plurality in O\u2019Connor v.\nOrtega, 480 U. S. 709, 717 (1987), is standardless and\nunsupported. Id., at 729\u2013732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment). In this case, the proper threshold inquiry\nshould be not whether the Fourth Amendment applies to\nmessages on public employees\u2019 employer-issued pagers,\nbut whether it applies in general to such messages on\nemployer-issued pagers. See id., at 731.\n   Here, however, there is no need to answer that thresh\nold question. Even accepting at face value Quon\u2019s and his\nco-plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the Fourth Amendment applies to\ntheir messages, the city\u2019s search was reasonable, and thus\ndid not violate the Amendment. See id., at 726 (plurality\nopinion); id., at 732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\nSince it is unnecessary to decide whether the Fourth\nAmendment applies, it is unnecessary to resolve which\napproach in O\u2019Connor controls: the plurality\u2019s or mine.*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Despite his disclaimer, ante, at 2, n. (concurring opinion), JUSTICE\nSTEVENS\u2019 concurrence implies, ante, at 1\u20132, that it is also an open\n2                         ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nThat should end the matter.\n   The Court concedes as much, ante, at 9, 12\u201317, yet it\ninexplicably interrupts its analysis with a recitation of the\nparties\u2019 arguments concerning, and an excursus on the\ncomplexity and consequences of answering, that admit\ntedly irrelevant threshold question, ante, at 9\u201312. That\ndiscussion is unnecessary. (To whom do we owe an addi\ntional explanation for declining to decide an issue, once we\nhave explained that it makes no difference?) It also seems\nto me exaggerated. Applying the Fourth Amendment to\nnew technologies may sometimes be difficult, but when it\nis necessary to decide a case we have no choice. The\nCourt\u2019s implication, ante, at 10, that where electronic\nprivacy is concerned we should decide less than we other\nwise would (that is, less than the principle of law neces\nsary to resolve the case and guide private action)\u2014or that\nwe should hedge our bets by concocting case-specific stan\ndards or issuing opaque opinions\u2014is in my view indefen\nsible. The-times-they-are-a-changin\u2019 is a feeble excuse for\ndisregard of duty.\n   Worse still, the digression is self-defeating. Despite the\nCourt\u2019s insistence that it is agnostic about the proper test,\nlower courts will likely read the Court\u2019s self-described\n\u201cinstructive\u201d expatiation on how the O\u2019Connor plurality\u2019s\napproach would apply here (if it applied), ante, at 9\u201311, as\na heavy-handed hint about how they should proceed.\nLitigants will do likewise, using the threshold question\nwhether the Fourth Amendment is even implicated as a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nquestion whether the approach advocated by Justice Blackmun in his\ndissent in O\u2019Connor is the proper standard. There is room for reason\nable debate as to which of the two approaches advocated by Justices\nwhose votes supported the judgment in O\u2019Connor\u2014the plurality\u2019s and\nmine\u2014is controlling under Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193\n(1977). But unless O\u2019Connor is overruled, it is assuredly false that a\ntest that would have produced the opposite result in that case is still in\nthe running.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Argued April 19, 2010\u2014Decided June 17, 2010\nPetitioner Ontario (hereinafter City) acquired alphanumeric pagers\n  able to send and receive text messages. Its contract with its service\n  provider, Arch Wireless, provided for a monthly limit on the number\n  of characters each pager could send or receive, and specified that us\n  age exceeding that number would result in an additional fee. The\n  City issued the pagers to respondent Quon and other officers in its\n  police department (OPD), also a petitioner here. When Quon and\n  others exceeded their monthly character limits for several months\n  running, petitioner Scharf, OPD\u2019s chief, sought to determine whether\n  the existing limit was too low, i.e., whether the officers had to pay\n  fees for sending work-related messages or, conversely, whether the\n  overages were for personal messages. After Arch Wireless provided\n  transcripts of Quon\u2019s and another employee\u2019s August and September\n  2002 text messages, it was discovered that many of Quon\u2019s messages\n  were not work related, and some were sexually explicit. Scharf re\n  ferred the matter to OPD\u2019s internal affairs division. The investigat\n  ing officer used Quon\u2019s work schedule to redact from his transcript\n  any messages he sent while off duty, but the transcript showed that\n  few of his on-duty messages related to police business. Quon was dis\n  ciplined for violating OPD rules.\n    He and the other respondents\u2014each of whom had exchanged text\n  messages with Quon during August and September\u2014filed this suit,\n  alleging, inter alia, that petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment\n  rights and the federal Stored Communications Act (SCA) by obtain\n  ing and reviewing the transcript of Quon\u2019s pager messages, and that\n  Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcript.\n  The District Court denied respondents summary judgment on the\n2                           ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    constitutional claims, relying on the plurality opinion in O\u2019Connor v.\n    Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, to determine that Quon had a reasonable ex\n    pectation of privacy in the content of his messages. Whether the au\n    dit was nonetheless reasonable, the court concluded, turned on\n    whether Scharf used it for the improper purpose of determining if\n    Quon was using his pager to waste time, or for the legitimate purpose\n    of determining the efficacy of existing character limits to ensure that\n    officers were not paying hidden work-related costs. After the jury\n    concluded that Scharf\u2019s intent was legitimate, the court granted peti\n    tioners summary judgment on the ground they did not violate the\n    Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Although it agreed\n    that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text mes\n    sages, the appeals court concluded that the search was not reason\n    able even though it was conducted on a legitimate, work-related ra\n    tionale. The opinion pointed to a host of means less intrusive than\n    the audit that Scharf could have used. The court further concluded\n    that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by giving the City the tran\n    script.\nHeld: Because the search of Quon\u2019s text messages was reasonable, peti\n tioners did not violate respondents\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights, and\n the Ninth Circuit erred by concluding otherwise. Pp. 7\u201317.\n    (a) The Amendment guarantees a person\u2019s privacy, dignity, and se\n curity against arbitrary and invasive governmental acts, without re\n gard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or per\n forming another function. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019\n Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 613\u2013614. It applies as well when the govern\n ment acts in its capacity as an employer. Treasury Employees v. Von\n Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 665. The Members of the O\u2019Connor Court dis\n agreed on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment\n claims against government employers. A four-Justice plurality con\n cluded that the correct analysis has two steps. First, because \u201csome\n [government] offices may be so open . . . that no expectation of pri\n vacy is reasonable,\u201d a court must consider \u201c[t]he operational realities\n of the workplace\u201d to determine if an employee\u2019s constitutional rights\n are implicated. 480 U. S., at 718. Second, where an employee has a\n legitimate privacy expectation, an employer\u2019s intrusion on that ex\n pectation \u201cfor noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for\n investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the\n standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.\u201d Id., at 725\u2013\n 726. JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment, would have dis\n pensed with the \u201coperational realities\u201d inquiry and concluded \u201cthat\n the offices of government employees . . . are [generally] covered by\n Fourth Amendment protections,\u201d id., at 731, but he would also have\n held \u201cthat government searches to retrieve work-related materials or\n                   Cite as: 560 U.

Amendment,\u201d id., at 732. Pp. 7\u20139.\n   (b) Even assuming that Quon had a reasonable expectation of pri\nvacy in his text messages, the search was reasonable under both\nO\u2019Connor approaches, the plurality\u2019s and JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s. Pp. 9\u201317.\n     (1) The Court does not resolve the parties\u2019 disagreement over\nQuon\u2019s privacy expectation. Prudence counsels caution before the\nfacts in this case are used to establish far-reaching premises that de\nfine the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations of employees\nusing employer-provided communication devices. Rapid changes in\nthe dynamics of communication and information transmission are\nevident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as\nproper behavior. At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms,\nand the law\u2019s treatment of them, will evolve. Because it is therefore\npreferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds, the Court as\nsumes, arguendo, that: (1) Quon had a reasonable privacy expecta\ntion; (2) petitioners\u2019 review of the transcript constituted a Fourth\nAmendment search; and (3) the principles applicable to a government\nemployer\u2019s search of an employee\u2019s physical office apply as well in the\nelectronic sphere. Pp. 9\u201312.\n   (2) Petitioners\u2019 warrantless review of Quon\u2019s pager transcript was\nreasonable under the O\u2019Connor plurality\u2019s approach because it was\nmotivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was\nnot excessive in scope. See 480 U. S., at 726. There were \u201creasonable\ngrounds for [finding it] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related\npurpose,\u201d ibid., in that Chief Scharf had ordered the audit to deter\nmine whether the City\u2019s contractual character limit was sufficient to\nmeet the City\u2019s needs. It was also \u201creasonably related to the objec\ntives of the search,\u201d ibid., because both the City and OPD had a le\ngitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to\npay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or, on the\nother hand, that the City was not paying for extensive personal\ncommunications. Reviewing the transcripts was an efficient and ex\npedient way to determine whether either of these factors caused\nQuon\u2019s overages. And the review was also not \u201cexcessively intrusive.\u201d\nIbid. Although Quon had exceeded his monthly allotment a number\nof times, OPD requested transcripts for only August and September\n2002 in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide the character\nlimits\u2019 efficaciousness, and all the messages that Quon sent while off\nduty were redacted. And from OPD\u2019s perspective, the fact that Quon\nlikely had only a limited privacy expectation lessened the risk that\nthe review would intrude on highly private details of Quon\u2019s life.\nSimilarly, because the City had a legitimate reason for the search\n4                           ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    and it was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification, the\n    search would be \u201cregarded as reasonable and normal in the private\n    employer context\u201d and thereby satisfy the approach of JUSTICE\n    SCALIA\u2019s concurrence, id., at 732. Conversely, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n    \u201cleast intrusive\u201d means approach was inconsistent with controlling\n    precedents. See, e.g., Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S.\n    646, 663. Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (c) Whether the other respondents can have a reasonable expecta\n    tion of privacy in their text messages to Quon need not be resolved.\n    They argue that because the search was unreasonable as to Quon, it\n    was also unreasonable as to them, but they make no corollary argu\n    ment that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be\n    unreasonable as to them. Given this litigating position and the\n    Court\u2019s conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Quon, these\n    other respondents cannot prevail.

The City, OPD, and OPD\u2019s Chief, Lloyd\nScharf, are petitioners here. As will be discussed, two\nrespondents share the last name Quon. In this opinion\n\u201cQuon\u201d refers to Jeff Quon, for the relevant events mostly\nrevolve around him.\n  In October 2001, the City acquired 20 alphanumeric\npagers capable of sending and receiving text messages.\nArch Wireless Operating Company provided wireless\nservice for the pagers. Under the City\u2019s service contract\nwith Arch Wireless, each pager was allotted a limited\nnumber of characters sent or received each month. Usage\nin excess of that amount would result in an additional fee.\nThe City issued pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team\nmembers in order to help the SWAT Team mobilize and\nrespond to emergency situations.\n  Before acquiring the pagers, the City announced a\n\u201cComputer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy\u201d (Computer\nPolicy) that applied to all employees. Among other provi\u00ad\nsions, it specified that the City \u201creserves the right to moni\u00ad\ntor and log all network activity including e-mail and\nInternet use, with or without notice. Users should have no\nexpectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these\nresources.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. In March 2000,\nQuon signed a statement acknowledging that he had read\nand understood the Computer Policy.\n  The Computer Policy did not apply, on its face, to text\nmessaging. Text messages share similarities with e-mails,\nbut the two differ in an important way. In this case, for\ninstance, an e-mail sent on a City computer was transmit\u00ad\nted through the City\u2019s own data servers, but a text mes\u00ad\nsage sent on one of the City\u2019s pagers was transmitted\nusing wireless radio frequencies from an individual pager\nto a receiving station owned by Arch Wireless. It was\nrouted through Arch Wireless\u2019 computer network, where it\nremained until the recipient\u2019s pager or cellular telephone\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas ready to receive the message, at which point Arch\nWireless transmitted the message from the transmitting\nstation nearest to the recipient. After delivery, Arch\nWireless retained a copy on its computer servers. The\nmessage did not pass through computers owned by the\nCity.\n  Although the Computer Policy did not cover text mes\u00ad\nsages by its explicit terms, the City made clear to employ\u00ad\nees, including Quon, that the City would treat text mes\u00ad\nsages the same way as it treated e-mails. At an April 18,\n2002, staff meeting at which Quon was present, Lieuten\u00ad\nant Steven Duke, the OPD officer responsible for the City\u2019s\ncontract with Arch Wireless, told officers that messages\nsent on the pagers \u201care considered e-mail messages. This\nmeans that [text] messages would fall under the City\u2019s\npolicy as public information and [would be] eligible for\nauditing.\u201d App. 30. Duke\u2019s comments were put in writing\nin a memorandum sent on April 29, 2002, by Chief Scharf\nto Quon and other City personnel.\n  Within the first or second billing cycle after the pagers\nwere distributed, Quon exceeded his monthly text message\ncharacter allotment. Duke told Quon about the overage,\nand reminded him that messages sent on the pagers were\n\u201cconsidered e-mail and could be audited.\u201d Id., at 40. Duke\nsaid, however, that \u201cit was not his intent to audit [an]\nemployee\u2019s text messages to see if the overage [was] due to\nwork related transmissions.\u201d Ibid. Duke suggested that\nQuon could reimburse the City for the overage fee rather\nthan have Duke audit the messages. Quon wrote a check\nto the City for the overage. Duke offered the same ar\u00ad\nrangement to other employees who incurred overage fees.\n  Over the next few months, Quon exceeded his character\nlimit three or four times. Each time he reimbursed the\nCity. Quon and another officer again incurred overage\nfees for their pager usage in August 2002. At a meeting in\nOctober, Duke told Scharf that he had become \u201c \u2018tired of\n4                    ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbeing a bill collector.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 91. Scharf decided to de\u00ad\ntermine whether the existing character limit was too\nlow\u2014that is, whether officers such as Quon were having to\npay fees for sending work-related messages\u2014or if the\noverages were for personal messages. Scharf told Duke to\nrequest transcripts of text messages sent in August and\nSeptember by Quon and the other employee who had\nexceeded the character allowance.\n  At Duke\u2019s request, an administrative assistant em\u00ad\nployed by OPD contacted Arch Wireless. After verifying\nthat the City was the subscriber on the accounts, Arch\nWireless provided the desired transcripts. Duke reviewed\nthe transcripts and discovered that many of the messages\nsent and received on Quon\u2019s pager were not work related,\nand some were sexually explicit. Duke reported his find\u00ad\nings to Scharf, who, along with Quon\u2019s immediate supervi\u00ad\nsor, reviewed the transcripts himself. After his review,\nScharf referred the matter to OPD\u2019s internal affairs divi\u00ad\nsion for an investigation into whether Quon was violating\nOPD rules by pursuing personal matters while on duty.\n  The officer in charge of the internal affairs review was\nSergeant Patrick McMahon. Before conducting a review,\nMcMahon used Quon\u2019s work schedule to redact the tran\u00ad\nscripts in order to eliminate any messages Quon sent\nwhile off duty. He then reviewed the content of the mes\u00ad\nsages Quon sent during work hours. McMahon\u2019s report\nnoted that Quon sent or received 456 messages during\nwork hours in the month of August 2002, of which no more\nthan 57 were work related; he sent as many as 80 mes\u00ad\nsages during a single day at work; and on an average\nworkday, Quon sent or received 28 messages, of which\nonly 3 were related to police business. The report con\u00ad\ncluded that Quon had violated OPD rules. Quon was\nallegedly disciplined.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

C. \u00a72701 et seq., popularly known as the\nStored Communications Act (SCA); and California law,\nQuon filed suit against petitioners in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Central District of California. Arch\nWireless and an individual not relevant here were also\nnamed as defendants. Quon was joined in his suit by\nanother plaintiff who is not a party before this Court and\nby the other respondents, each of whom exchanged text\nmessages with Quon during August and September 2002:\nJerilyn Quon, Jeff Quon\u2019s then-wife, from whom he was\nseparated; April Florio, an OPD employee with whom Jeff\nQuon was romantically involved; and Steve Trujillo, an\u00ad\nother member of the OPD SWAT Team. Among the alle\u00ad\ngations in the complaint was that petitioners violated\nrespondents\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights and the SCA by\nobtaining and reviewing the transcript of Jeff Quon\u2019s\npager messages and that Arch Wireless had violated the\nSCA by turning over the transcript to the City.\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\nThe District Court granted Arch Wireless\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment on the SCA claim but denied petition\u00ad\ners\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the Fourth Amend\u00ad\nment claims.

S. 709, 711\n(1987), the District Court determined that Quon had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his text\nmessages. Whether the audit of the text messages was\nnonetheless reasonable, the District Court concluded,\nturned on Chief Scharf\u2019s intent: \u201c[I]f the purpose for the\naudit was to determine if Quon was using his pager to\n\u2018play games\u2019 and \u2018waste time,\u2019 then the audit was not\nconstitutionally reasonable\u201d; but if the audit\u2019s purpose\n\u201cwas to determine the efficacy of the existing character\n6                     ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlimits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work\u00ad\nrelated costs, . . . no constitutional violation occurred.\u201d\n445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1146.\n   The District Court held a jury trial to determine the\npurpose of the audit. The jury concluded that Scharf\nordered the audit to determine the efficacy of the charac\u00ad\nter limits. The District Court accordingly held that peti\u00ad\ntioners did not violate the Fourth Amendment. It entered\njudgment in their favor.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir\u00ad\ncuit reversed in part. 529 F. 3d 892 (2008). The panel\nagreed with the District Court that Jeff Quon had a rea\u00ad\nsonable expectation of privacy in his text messages but\ndisagreed with the District Court about whether the\nsearch was reasonable. Even though the search was\nconducted for \u201ca legitimate work-related rationale,\u201d the\nCourt of Appeals concluded, it \u201cwas not reasonable in\nscope.\u201d Id., at 908. The panel disagreed with the District\nCourt\u2019s observation that \u201cthere were no less-intrusive\nmeans\u201d that Chief Scharf could have used \u201cto verify the\nefficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding\non [respondents\u2019] Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d Id., at 908\u2013\n909. The opinion pointed to a \u201chost of simple ways\u201d that\nthe chief could have used instead of the audit, such as\nwarning Quon at the beginning of the month that his\nfuture messages would be audited, or asking Quon himself\nto redact the transcript of his messages. Id., at 909. The\nCourt of Appeals further concluded that Arch Wireless had\nviolated the SCA by turning over the transcript to the\nCity.\n   The Ninth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing en\nbanc. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., 554 F. 3d 769\n(2009). Judge Ikuta, joined by six other Circuit Judges,\ndissented. Id., at 774\u2013779.

Camara v. Municipal Court of City and\nCounty of San Francisco, 387 U. S. 523, 530 (1967). \u201cThe\nAmendment guarantees the privacy, dignity, and security\nof persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by\nofficers of the Government,\u201d without regard to whether the\ngovernment actor is investigating crime or performing\nanother function. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019\nAssn., 489 U. S. 602, 613\u2013614 (1989). The Fourth Amend\u00ad\nment applies as well when the Government acts in its\ncapacity as an employer. Treasury Employees v. Von\nRaab, 489 U. S. 656, 665 (1989).\n  The Court discussed this principle in O\u2019Connor. There a\nphysician employed by a state hospital alleged that hospi\u00ad\ntal officials investigating workplace misconduct had vio\u00ad\nlated his Fourth Amendment rights by searching his office\nand seizing personal items from his desk and filing cabi\u00ad\nnet. All Members of the Court agreed with the general\nprinciple that \u201c[i]ndividuals do not lose Fourth Amend\u00ad\nment rights merely because they work for the government\ninstead of a private employer.\u201d 480 U.

(quoting same).\n   The O\u2019Connor Court did disagree on the proper analyti\u00ad\ncal framework for Fourth Amendment claims against\ngovernment employers. A four-Justice plurality concluded\nthat the correct analysis has two steps. First, because\n\u201csome government offices may be so open to fellow em\u00ad\nployees or the public that no expectation of privacy is\nreasonable,\u201d id., at 718, a court must consider \u201c[t]he opera\u00ad\ntional realities of the workplace\u201d in order to determine\nwhether an employee\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights are\nimplicated, id., at 717. On this view, \u201cthe question\nwhether an employee has a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Id., at\n718. Next, where an employee has a legitimate privacy\nexpectation, an employer\u2019s intrusion on that expectation\n\u201cfor noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as\nfor investigations of work-related misconduct, should be\njudged by the standard of reasonableness under all the\ncircumstances.\u201d Id., at 725\u2013726.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment, outlined a\ndifferent approach. His opinion would have dispensed\nwith an inquiry into \u201coperational realities\u201d and would\nconclude \u201cthat the offices of government employees . . . are\ncovered by Fourth Amendment protections as a general\nmatter.\u201d Id., at 731. But he would also have held \u201cthat\ngovernment searches to retrieve work-related materials or\nto investigate violations of workplace rules\u2014searches of\nthe sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the\nprivate-employer context\u2014do not violate the Fourth\nAmendment.\u201d Id., at 732.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Later, in the Von Raab decision, the Court explained\nthat \u201coperational realities\u201d could diminish an employee\u2019s\nprivacy expectations, and that this diminution could be\ntaken into consideration when assessing the reasonable\u00ad\nness of a workplace search. 489 U. S., at 671. In the two\ndecades since O\u2019Connor, however, the threshold test for\ndetermining the scope of an employee\u2019s Fourth Amend\u00ad\nment rights has not been clarified further. Here, though\nthey disagree on whether Quon had a reasonable expecta\u00ad\ntion of privacy, both petitioners and respondents start\nfrom the premise that the O\u2019Connor plurality controls.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 22\u201328; Brief for Respondents 25\u2013\n32. It is not necessary to resolve whether that premise is\ncorrect. The case can be decided by determining that the\nsearch was reasonable even assuming Quon had a reason\u00ad\nable expectation of privacy.      The two O\u2019Connor ap\u00ad\nproaches\u2014the plurality\u2019s and JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s\u2014therefore\nlead to the same result here.\n                             III \n\n                              A\n\n  Before turning to the reasonableness of the search, it is\ninstructive to note the parties\u2019 disagreement over whether\nQuon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The record\ndoes establish that OPD, at the outset, made it clear that\npager messages were not considered private. The City\u2019s\nComputer Policy stated that \u201c[u]sers should have no ex\u00ad\npectation of privacy or confidentiality when using\u201d City\ncomputers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 152a. Chief Scharf\u2019s\nmemo and Duke\u2019s statements made clear that this official\npolicy extended to text messaging. The disagreement, at\nleast as respondents see the case, is over whether Duke\u2019s\nlater statements overrode the official policy. Respondents\ncontend that because Duke told Quon that an audit would\nbe unnecessary if Quon paid for the overage, Quon rea\u00ad\nsonably could expect that the contents of his messages\n10                   ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwould remain private.\n   At this point, were we to assume that inquiry into \u201cop\u00ad\nerational realities\u201d were called for, compare O\u2019Connor, 480\nU. S., at 717 (plurality opinion), with id., at 730\u2013731\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.); see also id., at 737\u2013738 (Blackmun,\nJ., dissenting), it would be necessary to ask whether\nDuke\u2019s statements could be taken as announcing a change\nin OPD policy, and if so, whether he had, in fact or ap\u00ad\npearance, the authority to make such a change and to\nguarantee the privacy of text messaging. It would also be\nnecessary to consider whether a review of messages sent\non police pagers, particularly those sent while officers are\non duty, might be justified for other reasons, including\nperformance evaluations, litigation concerning the lawful\u00ad\nness of police actions, and perhaps compliance with state\nopen records laws. See Brief for Petitioners 35\u201340 (citing\nCal. Public Records Act, Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a76250 et seq.\n(West 2008)). These matters would all bear on the legiti\u00ad\nmacy of an employee\u2019s privacy expectation.\n   The Court must proceed with care when considering the\nwhole concept of privacy expectations in communications\nmade on electronic equipment owned by a government\nemployer. The judiciary risks error by elaborating too\nfully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging\ntechnology before its role in society has become clear. See,\ne.g., Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928),\noverruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 353\n(1967). In Katz, the Court relied on its own knowledge\nand experience to conclude that there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in a telephone booth. See id., at\n360\u2013361 (Harlan, J., concurring). It is not so clear that\ncourts at present are on so sure a ground. Prudence coun\u00ad\nsels caution before the facts in the instant case are used to\nestablish far-reaching premises that define the existence,\nand extent, of privacy expectations enjoyed by employees\nwhen using employer-provided communication devices.\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and\ninformation transmission are evident not just in the tech\u00ad\nnology itself but in what society accepts as proper behav\u00ad\nior. As one amici brief notes, many employers expect or at\nleast tolerate personal use of such equipment by employ\u00ad\nees because it often increases worker efficiency. See Brief\nfor Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. 16\u201320. Another\namicus points out that the law is beginning to respond to\nthese developments, as some States have recently passed\nstatutes requiring employers to notify employees when\nmonitoring their electronic communications. See Brief for\nNew York Intellectual Property Law Association 22 (citing\nDel. Code Ann., Tit. 19, \u00a7705 (2005); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a731\u201348d (West 2003)). At present, it is uncertain how\nworkplace norms, and the law\u2019s treatment of them, will\nevolve.\n   Even if the Court were certain that the O\u2019Connor plural\u00ad\nity\u2019s approach were the right one, the Court would have\ndifficulty predicting how employees\u2019 privacy expectations\nwill be shaped by those changes or the degree to which\nsociety will be prepared to recognize those expectations as\nreasonable. See 480 U. S., at 715. Cell phone and text\nmessage communications are so pervasive that some\npersons may consider them to be essential means or nec\u00ad\nessary instruments for self-expression, even self\u00ad\nidentification. That might strengthen the case for an\nexpectation of privacy. On the other hand, the ubiquity of\nthose devices has made them generally affordable, so one\ncould counter that employees who need cell phones or\nsimilar devices for personal matters can purchase and pay\nfor their own. And employer policies concerning commu\u00ad\nnications will of course shape the reasonable expectations\nof their employees, especially to the extent that such\npolicies are clearly communicated.\n   A broad holding concerning employees\u2019 privacy expecta\u00ad\ntions vis-\u00e0-vis employer-provided technological equipment\n12                   ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmight have implications for future cases that cannot be\npredicted. It is preferable to dispose of this case on nar\u00ad\nrower grounds. For present purposes we assume several\npropositions arguendo: First, Quon had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the text messages sent on the\npager provided to him by the City; second, petitioners\u2019\nreview of the transcript constituted a search within the\nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment; and third, the princi\u00ad\nples applicable to a government employer\u2019s search of an\nemployee\u2019s physical office apply with at least the same\nforce when the employer intrudes on the employee\u2019s pri\u00ad\nvacy in the electronic sphere.\n                               B\n   Even if Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in\nhis text messages, petitioners did not necessarily violate\nthe Fourth Amendment by obtaining and reviewing the\ntranscripts. Although as a general matter, warrantless\nsearches \u201care per se unreasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment,\u201d there are \u201ca few specifically established and\nwell-delineated exceptions\u201d to that general rule. Katz,\nsupra, at 357. The Court has held that the \u201c \u2018special\nneeds\u2019 \u201d of the workplace justify one such exception.\nO\u2019Connor, 480 U.

As a jury found, Chief Scharf ordered\nthe search in order to determine whether the character\nlimit on the City\u2019s contract with Arch Wireless was suffi\u00ad\ncient to meet the City\u2019s needs. This was, as the Ninth\nCircuit noted, a \u201clegitimate work-related rationale.\u201d 529\nF. 3d, at 908. The City and OPD had a legitimate interest\nin ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay\nout of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or on\nthe other hand that the City was not paying for extensive\npersonal communications.\n  As for the scope of the search, reviewing the transcripts\nwas reasonable because it was an efficient and expedient\nway to determine whether Quon\u2019s overages were the result\nof work-related messaging or personal use. The review\nwas also not \u201c \u2018excessively intrusive.\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Connor, supra, at\n726 (plurality opinion). Although Quon had gone over his\nmonthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested\ntranscripts for only the months of August and September\n2002. While it may have been reasonable as well for OPD\nto review transcripts of all the months in which Quon\nexceeded his allowance, it was certainly reasonable for\nOPD to review messages for just two months in order to\nobtain a large enough sample to decide whether the char\u00ad\nacter limits were efficacious. And it is worth noting that\nduring his internal affairs investigation, McMahon re\u00ad\ndacted all messages Quon sent while off duty, a measure\nwhich reduced the intrusiveness of any further review of\nthe transcripts.\n  Furthermore, and again on the assumption that Quon\nhad a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of\nhis messages, the extent of an expectation is relevant to\nassessing whether the search was too intrusive. See Von\n14                    ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRaab, supra, at 671; cf. Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Ac\nton, 515 U. S. 646, 654\u2013657 (1995). Even if he could as\u00ad\nsume some level of privacy would inhere in his messages,\nit would not have been reasonable for Quon to conclude\nthat his messages were in all circumstances immune from\nscrutiny. Quon was told that his messages were subject to\nauditing. As a law enforcement officer, he would or should\nhave known that his actions were likely to come under\nlegal scrutiny, and that this might entail an analysis of his\non-the-job communications. Under the circumstances, a\nreasonable employee would be aware that sound manage\u00ad\nment principles might require the audit of messages to\ndetermine whether the pager was being appropriately\nused. Given that the City issued the pagers to Quon and\nother SWAT Team members in order to help them more\nquickly respond to crises\u2014and given that Quon had re\u00ad\nceived no assurances of privacy\u2014Quon could have antici\u00ad\npated that it might be necessary for the City to audit\npager messages to assess the SWAT Team\u2019s performance\nin particular emergency situations.\n   From OPD\u2019s perspective, the fact that Quon likely had\nonly a limited privacy expectation, with boundaries that\nwe need not here explore, lessened the risk that the review\nwould intrude on highly private details of Quon\u2019s life.\nOPD\u2019s audit of messages on Quon\u2019s employer-provided\npager was not nearly as intrusive as a search of his per\u00ad\nsonal e-mail account or pager, or a wiretap on his home\nphone line, would have been. That the search did reveal\nintimate details of Quon\u2019s life does not make it unreason\u00ad\nable, for under the circumstances a reasonable employer\nwould not expect that such a review would intrude on such\nmatters. The search was permissible in its scope.\n   The Court of Appeals erred in finding the search unrea\u00ad\nsonable. It pointed to a \u201chost of simple ways to verify the\nefficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding\non [respondents\u2019] Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d 529 F. 3d,\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nat 909. The panel suggested that Scharf \u201ccould have\nwarned Quon that for the month of September he was\nforbidden from using his pager for personal communica\u00ad\ntions, and that the contents of all his messages would be\nreviewed to ensure the pager was used only for work\u00ad\nrelated purposes during that time frame. Alternatively, if\n[OPD] wanted to review past usage, it could have asked\nQuon to count the characters himself, or asked him to\nredact personal messages and grant permission to [OPD]\nto review the redacted transcript.\u201d Ibid.\n   This approach was inconsistent with controlling prece\u00ad\ndents. This Court has \u201crepeatedly refused to declare that\nonly the \u2018least intrusive\u2019 search practicable can be reason\u00ad\nable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Vernonia, supra, at\n663; see also, e.g., Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist.\nNo. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, 536 U. S. 822, 837\n(2002); Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, 647 (1983).\nThat rationale \u201ccould raise insuperable barriers to the\nexercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers,\u201d\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 557, n. 12\n(1976), because \u201cjudges engaged in post hoc evaluations of\ngovernment conduct can almost always imagine some\nalternative means by which the objectives of the govern\u00ad\nment might have been accomplished,\u201d Skinner, 489 U. S.,\nat 629, n. 9 (internal quotation marks and brackets omit\u00ad\nted). The analytic errors of the Court of Appeals in this\ncase illustrate the necessity of this principle. Even assum\u00ad\ning there were ways that OPD could have performed the\nsearch that would have been less intrusive, it does not\nfollow that the search as conducted was unreasonable.\n   Respondents argue that the search was per se unrea\u00ad\nsonable in light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that\nArch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the\ntranscripts of Quon\u2019s text messages. The merits of the\nSCA claim are not before us. But even if the Court of\nAppeals was correct to conclude that the SCA forbade\n16                   ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArch Wireless from turning over the transcripts, it does\nnot follow that petitioners\u2019 actions were unreasonable.\nRespondents point to no authority for the proposition that\nthe existence of statutory protection renders a search per\nse unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. And the\nprecedents counsel otherwise. See Virginia v. Moore, 553\nU. S. 164, 168 (2008) (search incident to an arrest that\nwas illegal under state law was reasonable); California v.\nGreenwood, 486 U. S. 35, 43 (1988) (rejecting argument\nthat if state law forbade police search of individual\u2019s gar\u00ad\nbage the search would violate the Fourth Amendment).\nFurthermore, respondents do not maintain that any OPD\nemployee either violated the law him- or herself or knew\nor should have known that Arch Wireless, by turning over\nthe transcript, would have violated the law. The other\u00ad\nwise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreason\u00ad\nable by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the\nSCA by turning over the transcripts.\n  Because the search was motivated by a legitimate work\u00ad\nrelated purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope,\nthe search was reasonable under the approach of the\nO\u2019Connor plurality. 480 U. S., at 726. For these same\nreasons\u2014that the employer had a legitimate reason for\nthe search, and that the search was not excessively intru\u00ad\nsive in light of that justification\u2014the Court also concludes\nthat the search would be \u201cregarded as reasonable and\nnormal in the private-employer context\u201d and would satisfy\nthe approach of JUSTICE SCALIA\u2019s concurrence. Id., at 732.\nThe search was reasonable, and the Court of Appeals\nerred by holding to the contrary. Petitioners did not vio\u00ad\nlate Quon\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\n                             C\n  Finally, the Court must consider whether the search\nviolated the Fourth Amendment rights of Jerilyn Quon,\nFlorio, and Trujillo, the respondents who sent text mes\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsages to Jeff Quon. Petitioners and respondents disagree\nwhether a sender of a text message can have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in a message he knowingly sends to\nsomeone\u2019s employer-provided pager. It is not necessary to\nresolve this question in order to dispose of the case, how\u00ad\never. Respondents argue that because \u201cthe search was\nunreasonable as to Sergeant Quon, it was also unreason\u00ad\nable as to his correspondents.\u201d Brief for Respondents 60\n(some capitalization omitted; boldface deleted). They\nmake no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable\nas to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to\nQuon\u2019s correspondents. See id., at 65\u201366. In light of this\nlitigating position and the Court\u2019s conclusion that the\nsearch was reasonable as to Jeff Quon, it necessarily\nfollows that these other respondents cannot prevail.\n                        *    *   *\n  Because the search was reasonable, petitioners did not\nviolate respondents\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights, and the\ncourt below erred by concluding otherwise. The judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consis\u00ad\ntent with this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

Or\ntega, 480 U. S. 709 (1987), provides the correct approach to\ndetermining an employee\u2019s reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. See ante, at 9. Justice Blackmun, writing for the\nfour dissenting Justices in O\u2019Connor, agreed with JUSTICE\nSCALIA that an employee enjoys a reasonable expectation\nof privacy in his office. 480 U. S., at 737. But he advo\ncated a third approach to the reasonable expectation of\nprivacy inquiry, separate from those proposed by the\nO\u2019Connor plurality and by JUSTICE SCALIA, see ante, at 8.\nRecognizing that it is particularly important to safeguard\n\u201ca public employee\u2019s expectation of privacy in the work\nplace\u201d in light of the \u201creality of work in modern time,\u201d 480\nU. S., at 739, which lacks \u201ctidy distinctions\u201d between\nworkplace and private activities, ibid., Justice Blackmun\nargued that \u201cthe precise extent of an employee\u2019s expecta\ntion of privacy often turns on the nature of the search,\u201d id.,\nat 738. And he emphasized that courts should determine\nthis expectation in light of the specific facts of each par\nticular search, rather than by announcing a categorical\nstandard. See id., at 741.\n   For the reasons stated at page 13 of the Court\u2019s opinion,\n2                         ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                         STEVENS, J., concurring\n\nit is clear that respondent Jeff Quon, as a law enforcement\nofficer who served on a SWAT Team, should have under\nstood that all of his work-related actions\u2014including all of\nhis communications on his official pager\u2014were likely to be\nsubject to public and legal scrutiny. He therefore had only\na limited expectation of privacy in relation to this particu\nlar audit of his pager messages. Whether one applies the\nreasoning from Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion, JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s concurrence, or Justice Blackmun\u2019s dissent* in\nO\u2019Connor, the result is the same: The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals in this case must be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * I do not contend that Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion is controlling un\nder Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977), but neither is his\napproach to evaluating a reasonable expectation of privacy foreclosed\nby O\u2019Connor. Indeed, his approach to that inquiry led to the conclusion,\nshared by JUSTICE SCALIA but not adopted by the O\u2019Connor plurality,\nthat an employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office.\nSee O\u2019Connor v. Ortega, 480 U. S. 709, 718 (1987) (plurality opinion).\nBut Justice Blackmun would have applied the Fourth Amendment\u2019s\nwarrant and probable-cause requirements to workplace investigatory\nsearches, id., at 732 (dissenting opinion), whereas a majority of the\nCourt rejected that view, see id., at 722, 725 (plurality opinion); id., at\n732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). It was that analysis\u2014\nregarding the proper standard for evaluating a search when an em\nployee has a reasonable expectation of privacy\u2014that produced the\nopposite result in the case. This case does not implicate that debate\nbecause it does not involve an investigatory search. The jury concluded\nthat the purpose of the audit was to determine whether the character\nlimits were sufficient for work-related messages. See ante, at 6.\n                     Cite as: 560 U.

I con\ntinue to believe that the \u201coperational realities\u201d rubric for\ndetermining the Fourth Amendment\u2019s application to pub\nlic employees invented by the plurality in O\u2019Connor v.\nOrtega, 480 U. S. 709, 717 (1987), is standardless and\nunsupported. Id., at 729\u2013732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment). In this case, the proper threshold inquiry\nshould be not whether the Fourth Amendment applies to\nmessages on public employees\u2019 employer-issued pagers,\nbut whether it applies in general to such messages on\nemployer-issued pagers. See id., at 731.\n   Here, however, there is no need to answer that thresh\nold question. Even accepting at face value Quon\u2019s and his\nco-plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the Fourth Amendment applies to\ntheir messages, the city\u2019s search was reasonable, and thus\ndid not violate the Amendment. See id., at 726 (plurality\nopinion); id., at 732 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\nSince it is unnecessary to decide whether the Fourth\nAmendment applies, it is unnecessary to resolve which\napproach in O\u2019Connor controls: the plurality\u2019s or mine.*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Despite his disclaimer, ante, at 2, n. (concurring opinion), JUSTICE\nSTEVENS\u2019 concurrence implies, ante, at 1\u20132, that it is also an open\n2                         ONTARIO v. QUON\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nThat should end the matter.\n   The Court concedes as much, ante, at 9, 12\u201317, yet it\ninexplicably interrupts its analysis with a recitation of the\nparties\u2019 arguments concerning, and an excursus on the\ncomplexity and consequences of answering, that admit\ntedly irrelevant threshold question, ante, at 9\u201312. That\ndiscussion is unnecessary. (To whom do we owe an addi\ntional explanation for declining to decide an issue, once we\nhave explained that it makes no difference?) It also seems\nto me exaggerated. Applying the Fourth Amendment to\nnew technologies may sometimes be difficult, but when it\nis necessary to decide a case we have no choice. The\nCourt\u2019s implication, ante, at 10, that where electronic\nprivacy is concerned we should decide less than we other\nwise would (that is, less than the principle of law neces\nsary to resolve the case and guide private action)\u2014or that\nwe should hedge our bets by concocting case-specific stan\ndards or issuing opaque opinions\u2014is in my view indefen\nsible. The-times-they-are-a-changin\u2019 is a feeble excuse for\ndisregard of duty.\n   Worse still, the digression is self-defeating. Despite the\nCourt\u2019s insistence that it is agnostic about the proper test,\nlower courts will likely read the Court\u2019s self-described\n\u201cinstructive\u201d expatiation on how the O\u2019Connor plurality\u2019s\napproach would apply here (if it applied), ante, at 9\u201311, as\na heavy-handed hint about how they should proceed.\nLitigants will do likewise, using the threshold question\nwhether the Fourth Amendment is even implicated as a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nquestion whether the approach advocated by Justice Blackmun in his\ndissent in O\u2019Connor is the proper standard. There is room for reason\nable debate as to which of the two approaches advocated by Justices\nwhose votes supported the judgment in O\u2019Connor\u2014the plurality\u2019s and\nmine\u2014is controlling under Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193\n(1977). But unless O\u2019Connor is overruled, it is assuredly false that a\ntest that would have produced the opposite result in that case is still in\nthe running.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

In short, in saying\nwhy it is not saying more, the Court says much more than\nit should.\n   The Court\u2019s inadvertent boosting of the O\u2019Connor plural\nity\u2019s standard is all the more ironic because, in fleshing\nout its fears that applying that test to new technologies\nwill be too hard, the Court underscores the unworkability\nof that standard.
