NATIONAL LABOR \n\n              RELATIONS BOARD \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 08–1457. Argued March 23, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010\nThe Taft-Hartley Act increased the size of the National Labor Relations\n  Board (Board) from three members to five, see 29 U. S. C. §153(a),\n  and amended §3(b) of the National Labor Relations Act to increase\n  the Board’s quorum requirement from two members to three and to\n  allow the Board to delegate its authority to groups of at least three\n  members, see §153(b). In December 2007, the Board—finding itself\n  with only four members and expecting two more vacancies—\n  delegated, inter alia, its powers to a group of three members. On De\n  cember 31, one group member’s appointment expired, but the others\n  proceeded to issue Board decisions for the next 27 months as a two\n  member quorum of a three-member group. Two of those decisions\n  sustained unfair labor practice complaints against petitioner, which\n  sought review, challenging the two-member Board’s authority to is\n  sue orders. The Seventh Circuit ruled for the Government, conclud\n  ing that the two members constituted a valid quorum of a three\n  member group to which the Board had legitimately delegated its\n  powers.\nHeld: Section 3(b) requires that a delegee group maintain a member\n ship of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the Board.\n Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) The first sentence of §3(b), the so-called delegation clause, au\n thorizes the Board to delegate its powers only to a “group of three or\n more members.” This clause is best read to require that the delegee\n group maintain a membership of three in order for the delegation to\n remain valid. First, that is the only way to harmonize and give\n meaningful effect to all of §3(b)’s provisions: (1) the delegation clause;\n (2) the vacancy clause, which provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board\n2                NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of\n    the powers of the Board”; (3) the Board quorum requirement, which\n    mandates that “three members of the Board shall, at all times, con\n    stitute a quorum of the Board”; and (4) the group quorum provision,\n    which provides that “two members shall constitute a quorum” of any\n    delegee group. This reading is consonant with the Board quorum re\n    quirement of three participating members “at all times,” and it gives\n    material effect to the delegation clause’s three-member rule. It also\n    permits the vacancy clause to operate to provide that vacancies do\n    not impair the Board’s ability to take action, so long as the quorum is\n    satisfied. And it does not render inoperative the group quorum pro\n    vision, which continues to authorize a properly constituted three\n    member delegee group to issue a decision with only two members\n    participating when one is disqualified from a case. The Govern\n    ment’s contrary reading allows two members to act as the Board ad\n    infinitum, dramatically undercutting the Board quorum require\n    ment’s significance by allowing its permanent circumvention. It also\n    diminishes the delegation clause’s three-member requirement by\n    permitting a de facto two-member delegation. By allowing the Board\n    to include a third member in the group for only one minute before her\n    term expires, this approach also gives no meaningful effect to the\n    command implicit in both the delegation clause and the Board quo\n    rum requirement that the Board’s full power be vested in no fewer\n    than three members. Second, had Congress intended to authorize\n    two members to act on an ongoing basis, it could have used straight\n    forward language. The Court’s interpretation is consistent with the\n    Board’s longstanding practice of reconstituting a delegee group when\n    one group member’s term expired. Pp. 4–9.\n      (b) The Government’s several arguments against the Court’s inter\n    pretation—that the group quorum requirement and vacancy clause\n    together permit two members of a three-member group to constitute\n    a quorum even when there is no third member; that the vacancy\n    clause establishes that a vacancy in the group has no effect; and that\n    reading the statute to authorize the Board to act with only two mem\n    bers advances the congressional objective of Board efficiency—are\n    unconvincing.

See 29 U. S. C. §153(a). Concur\nrent with that change, the Taft-Hartley Act amended §3(b)\nof the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to increase\nthe quorum requirement for the Board from two members\nto three, and to allow the Board to delegate its authority to\ngroups of at least three members. See §153(b). The ques\ntion in this case is whether, following a delegation of the\nBoard’s powers to a three-member group, two members\nmay continue to exercise that delegated authority once the\ngroup’s (and the Board’s) membership falls to two. We\nhold that two remaining Board members cannot exercise\nsuch authority.\n                              I\n   As 2007 came to a close, the Board found itself with four\nmembers and one vacancy. It anticipated two more vacan\ncies at the end of the year, when the recess appointments\nof Members Kirsanow and Walsh were set to expire, which\nwould leave the Board with only two members—too few to\n2            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmeet the Board’s quorum requirement, §153(b). The four\nsitting members decided to take action in an effort to\npreserve the Board’s authority to function. On December\n20, 2007, the Board made two delegations of its authority,\neffective as of midnight December 28, 2007. First, the\nBoard delegated to the general counsel continuing author\nity to initiate and conduct litigation that would normally\nrequire case-by-case approval of the Board. See Minute of\nBoard Action (Dec. 20, 2007), App. to Brief for Petitioner\n4a–5a (hereinafter Board Minutes). Second, the Board\ndelegated “to Members Liebman, Schaumber and Kir\nsanow, as a three-member group, all of the Board’s pow\ners, in anticipation of the adjournment of the 1st Session\nof the 110th Congress.” Id., at 5a. The Board expressed\nthe opinion that its action would permit the remaining two\nmembers to exercise the powers of the Board “after [the]\ndeparture of Members Kirsanow and Walsh, because the\nremaining Members will constitute a quorum of the three\nmember group.” Ibid.\n   The Board’s minutes explain that it relied on “the statu\ntory language” of §3(b), as well as an opinion issued by the\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC), for the proposition that the\nBoard may use this delegation procedure to “issue deci\nsions during periods when three or more of the five seats\non the Board are vacant.” Id., at 6a. The OLC had con\ncluded in 2003 that “if the Board delegated all of its pow\ners to a group of three members, that group could continue\nto issue decisions and orders as long as a quorum of two\nmembers remained.” Dept. of Justice, OLC, Quorum\nRequirements, App. to Brief for Respondent 3a. In seek\ning the OLC’s advice, the Board agreed to accept the\nOLC’s answer regarding its ability to operate with only\ntwo members, id., at 1a, n. 1, and the Board in its minutes\ntherefore “acknowledged that it is bound” by the OLC\nopinion. Board Minutes 6a. The Board noted, however,\nthat it was not bound to make this delegation; rather, it\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhad “decided to exercise its discretion” to do so. Ibid.\n   On December 28, 2007, the Board’s delegation to the\nthree-member group of Members Liebman, Schaumber,\nand Kirsanow became effective. On December 31, 2007,\nMember Kirsanow’s recess appointment expired. Thus,\nstarting on January 1, 2008, Members Liebman and\nSchaumber became the only members of the Board. They\nproceeded to issue decisions for the Board as a two\nmember quorum of a three-member group. The delegation\nautomatically terminated on March 27, 2010, when the\nPresident made two recess appointments to the Board,\nbecause the terms of the delegation specified that it would\nbe revoked when the Board’s membership returned to at\nleast three members, id., at 7a.\n   During the 27-month period in which the Board had\nonly two members, it decided almost 600 cases. See Letter\nfrom Elena Kagan, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter,\nClerk of Court (Apr. 26, 2010). One of those cases involved\npetitioner New Process Steel. In September 2008, the two\nmember Board issued decisions sustaining two unfair\nlabor practice complaints against petitioner. See New\nProcess Steel, LP, 353 N. L. R. B. No. 25 (2008); New Proc\ness Steel, LP, 353 N. L. R. B. No. 13 (2008). Petitioner\nsought review of both orders in the Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit, and challenged the authority of the\ntwo-member Board to issue the orders.\n   The court ruled in favor of the Government. After a\nreview of the text and legislative history of §3(b) and the\nsequence of events surrounding the delegation of authority\nin December 2007, the court concluded that the then\nsitting two members constituted a valid quorum of a\nthree-member group to which the Board had legitimately\ndelegated all its powers. 564 F. 3d 840, 845–847 (CA7\n2009). On the same day that the Seventh Circuit issued\nits decision in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Dis\ntrict of Columbia announced a decision coming to the\n4              NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nopposite conclusion. Laurel Baye Healthcare of Lake\nLanier, Inc. v. NLRB, 564 F. 3d 469 (2009). We granted\ncertiorari to resolve the conflict.1 558 U. S. ___ (2009).\n                             II\n  The Board’s quorum requirements and delegation pro\ncedure are set forth in §3(b) of the NLRA, 49 Stat. 451, as\namended by 61 Stat. 139, which provides:\n        “The Board is authorized to delegate to any group of\n     three or more members any or all of the powers which\n     it may itself exercise. . . . A vacancy in the Board\n     shall not impair the right of the remaining members\n     to exercise all of the powers of the Board, and three\n     members of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a\n     quorum of the Board, except that two members shall\n     constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant\n     to the first sentence hereof.” 29 U. S. C. §153(b).\n  It is undisputed that the first sentence of this provision\nauthorized the Board to delegate its powers to the three\nmember group effective on December 28, 2007, and the\nlast sentence authorized two members of that group to act\nas a quorum of the group during the next three days if, for\nexample, the third member had to recuse himself from a\nparticular matter. The question we face is whether those\ntwo members could continue to act for the Board as a\nquorum of the delegee group after December 31, 2007,\nwhen the Board’s membership fell to two and the desig\nnated three-member group of “Members Liebman,\nSchaumber, and Kirsanow” ceased to exist due to the\n——————\n  1 Several other Courts of Appeals reached the same conclusion as the\n\nSeventh Circuit, although not always following the same reasoning.\nSee Northeastern Land Servs., Ltd. v.

Construing §3(b)\nas a whole and in light of the Board’s longstanding prac\ntice, we are persuaded that they could not.\n   The first sentence of §3(b), which we will call the delega\ntion clause, provides that the Board may delegate its\npowers only to a “group of three or more members.” 61\nStat. 139. There are two different ways to interpret that\nlanguage. One interpretation, put forward by the Gov\nernment, would read the clause to require only that a\ndelegee group contain three members at the precise time\nthe Board delegates its powers, and to have no continuing\nrelevance after the moment of the initial delegation.\nUnder that reading, two members alone may exercise the\nfull power of the Board so long as they were part of a\ndelegee group that, at the time of its creation, included\nthree members. The other interpretation, by contrast,\nwould read the clause as requiring that the delegee group\nmaintain a membership of three in order for the delega\ntion to remain valid. Three main reasons support the\nlatter reading.\n   First, and most fundamentally, reading the delegation\nclause to require that the Board’s delegated power be\nvested continuously in a group of three members is the\nonly way to harmonize and give meaningful effect to all of\nthe provisions in §3(b). See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S.\n167, 174 (2001) (declining to adopt a “construction of the\nstatute, [that] would render [a term] insignificant”); Mar\nket Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U. S. 112, 115–116 (1879) (“[A]\nstatute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it\ncan be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be . . .\ninsignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those\nprovisions are: (1) the delegation clause; (2) the vacancy\nclause, which provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall\nnot impair the right of the remaining members to exercise\nall of the powers of the Board”; (3) the Board quorum\nrequirement, which mandates that “three members of the\n6            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBoard shall, at all times, constitute a quorum of the\nBoard”; and (4) the group quorum provision, which pro\nvides that “two members shall constitute a quorum” of any\ndelegee group. See §153(b).\n   Interpreting the statute to require the Board’s powers to\nbe vested at all times in a group of at least three members\nis consonant with the Board quorum requirement, which\nrequires three participating members “at all times” for the\nBoard to act. The interpretation likewise gives material\neffect to the three-member requirement in the delegation\nclause. The vacancy clause still operates to provide that\nvacancies do not impair the ability of the Board to take\naction, so long as the quorum is satisfied. And the inter\npretation does not render inoperative the group quorum\nprovision, which still operates to authorize a three\nmember delegee group to issue a decision with only two\nmembers participating, so long as the delegee group was\nproperly constituted. Reading §3(b) in this manner, the\nstatute’s various pieces hang together—a critical clue that\nthis reading is a sound one.\n   The contrary reading, on the other hand, allows two\nmembers to act as the Board ad infinitum, which dramati\ncally undercuts the significance of the Board quorum\nrequirement by allowing its permanent circumvention.\nThat reading also makes the three-member requirement\nin the delegation clause of vanishing significance, because\nit allows a de facto delegation to a two-member group, as\nhappened in this case. Under the Government’s approach,\nit would satisfy the statute for the Board to include a third\nmember in the group for only one minute before her term\nexpires; the approach gives no meaningful effect to the\ncommand implicit in both the delegation clause and in the\nBoard quorum requirement that the Board’s full power be\nvested in no fewer than three members. Hence, while the\nGovernment’s reading of the delegation clause is textually\npermissible in a narrow sense, it is structurally implausi\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nble, as it would render two of §3(b)’s provisions function\nally void.\n   Second, and relatedly, if Congress had intended to\nauthorize two members alone to act for the Board on an\nongoing basis, it could have said so in straightforward\nlanguage. Congress instead imposed the requirement that\nthe Board delegate authority to no fewer than three mem\nbers, and that it have three participating members to\nconstitute a quorum. Those provisions are at best an\nunlikely way of conveying congressional approval of a two\nmember Board. Indeed, had Congress wanted to provide\nfor two members alone to act as the Board, it could have\nmaintained the NLRA’s original two-member Board quo\nrum provision, see 29 U. S. C. §153(b) (1946 ed.), or pro\nvided for a delegation of the Board’s authority to groups of\ntwo. The Rube Goldberg-style delegation mechanism\nemployed by the Board in 2007—delegating to a group of\nthree, allowing a term to expire, and then continuing with\na two-member quorum of a phantom delegee group—is\nsurely a bizarre way for the Board to achieve the authority\nto decide cases with only two members. To conclude that\nCongress intended to authorize such a procedure to con\ntravene the three-member Board quorum, we would need\nsome evidence of that intent.\n   The Government has not adduced any convincing evi\ndence on this front, and to the contrary, our interpretation\nis consistent with the longstanding practice of the Board.\nThis is the third factor driving our decision. Although the\nBoard has throughout its history allowed two members of\na three-member group to issue decisions when one mem\nber of a group was disqualified from a case, see Brief for\nRespondent 20; Board Minutes 6a, the Board has not\n(until recently) allowed two members to act as a quorum of\na defunct three-member group.2 Instead, the Board con\n——————\n 2 When   one member of a group is disqualified, only two members\n8               NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncedes that its practice was to reconstitute a delegee group\nwhen one group member’s term expired. Brief for Respon\ndent 39, n. 27.3 That our interpretation of the delegation\nprovision is consistent with the Board’s longstanding\npractice is persuasive evidence that it is the correct one,\nnotwithstanding the Board’s more recent view. See Bowen\nv. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 214 (1988).\n   In sum, a straightforward understanding of the text,\nwhich requires that no fewer than three members be\nvested with the Board’s full authority, coupled with the\nBoard’s longstanding practice, points us toward an inter\npretation of the delegation clause that requires a delegee\ngroup to maintain a membership of three.\n                            III\n  Against these points, the Government makes several\narguments that we find unconvincing. It first argues that\n§3(b) authorizes the Board’s action by its plain terms,\nnotwithstanding the somewhat fictional nature of the\ndelegation to a three-member group with the expectation\nthat within days it would become a two-member group. In\n——————\nactually participate in the decision. That circumstance thus also\npresents the problem of the possible inferiority of two-member deci\nsionmaking. That the Board found it necessary to reconstitute groups\nonly when there was a vacancy, and not when there was a disqualifica\ntion, suggests that its practice was driven by more than its belief in\nthe “superiority of three-member groups,” post, at 10 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting).\n   3 It also has not been the Board’s practice to issue decisions when the\n\nBoard’s membership has fallen to two. For about a 2-month period in\n1993–1994, and a 1-month period in 2001–2002, the Board had only\ntwo members and did not issue decisions. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 4.\nIn 2005, the Board did delegate its authority to a three-member group,\nof which two members issued a few orders as a quorum during a 3-day\nperiod in which the Board’s (and the group’s) membership fell below\nthree. Ibid. But the two-member Board at issue in this case, extending\nover two years, is unprecedented in the history of the post-Taft-Hartley\nBoard.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nparticular, the Government contends the group quorum\nrequirement and the vacancy clause together make clear\nthat when the Board has delegated its power to a three\nmember group, “any two members of that group constitute\na quorum that may continue to exercise the delegated\npowers, regardless whether the third group member . . .\ncontinues to sit on the Board” and regardless “whether a\nquorum remains in the full Board.” Brief for Respondent\n17; see also id., at 20–23.\n  Although the group quorum provision clearly authorizes\ntwo members to act as a quorum of a “group designated\npursuant to the first sentence”—i.e., a group of at least\nthree members—it does not, by its plain terms, authorize\ntwo members to constitute a valid delegee group. A quo\nrum is the number of members of a larger body that must\nparticipate for the valid transaction of business. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1370 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\n“quorum” as the “minimum number of members . . . who\nmust be present for a deliberative assembly to legally\ntransact business”); 13 Oxford English Dictionary 51 (2d\ned. 1989) (“A fixed number of members of any body . . .\nwhose presence is necessary for the proper or valid trans\naction of business”); Webster’s New International Diction\nary 2046 (2d ed. 1954) (“Such a number of the officers or\nmembers of any body as is, when duly assembled, legally\ncompetent to transact business”). But the fact that there\nare sufficient members participating to constitute a quo\nrum does not necessarily establish that the larger body is\nproperly constituted or can validly exercise authority.4 In\n——————\n   4 Nor does failure to meet a quorum requirement necessarily establish\n\nthat an entity’s power is suspended so that it can be exercised by no\ndelegee. The requisite membership of an organization, and the number\nof members who must participate for it to take an action, are two\nseparate (albeit related) characteristics.

Therefore, because of the\nquorum provision, if “at least two members of a delegee\ngroup actually participate in a decision . . . that should be\nthe end of the matter,” regardless of vacancies in the\ngroup or on the Board. Ibid. But even if quorum provi\nsions ordinarily provide the rule for dealing with vacan\ncies—i.e., even if they ordinarily make irrelevant any\nvacancies in the remainder of the larger body—the quo\nrum provisions in §3(b) do no such thing. Rather, there is\na separate clause addressing vacancies. The vacancy\nclause, recall, provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall\nnot impair the right of the remaining members to exercise\nall of the powers of the Board.” §153(b) (2006 ed.).

The Board\nmay not, of course, itself take any action absent sufficient membership\nto muster a quorum (three), and in that sense a quorum requirement\nestablishes a minimum membership level. Our conclusion that the\ndelegee group ceases to exist once there are no longer three Board\nmembers to constitute the group does not cast doubt on the prior\ndelegations of authority to nongroup members, such as the regional\ndirectors or the general counsel. The latter implicates a separate\nquestion that our decision does not address.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But the\nclause speaks to the effect of a vacancy in the Board on the\nauthority to exercise the powers of the Board; it does not\nprovide a delegee group authority to act when there is a\nvacancy in the group. It is true that any vacancy in the\ngroup is necessarily also a vacancy in the Board (although\nthe converse is not true), and that a group exercises the\n(delegated) “powers of the Board.” But §3(b) explicitly\ndistinguishes between a group and the Board throughout,\nand in light of that distinction we do not think “Board”\nshould be read to include “group” when doing so would\nnegate for all practical purposes the command that\na delegation must be made to a group of at least three\nmembers.\n   Some courts have nonetheless interpreted the quorum\nand vacancy provisions of §3(b) by analogizing to an appel\nlate panel, which may decide a case even though only two\nof the three initially assigned judges remain on the panel.\nSee Photo-Sonics, Inc. v. NLRB, 678 F. 2d 121, 122–123\n(CA9 1982). The governing statute provides that a case\nmay be decided “by separate panels, each consisting of\nthree judges,” 28 U. S. C. §46(b), but that a “majority of\nthe number of judges authorized to constitute a court or\npanel thereof . . . shall constitute a quorum,” §46(d). We\nhave interpreted that statute to “requir[e] the inclusion of\nat least three judges in the first instance,” but to allow a\ntwo-judge “quorum to proceed to judgment when one\nmember of the panel dies or is disqualified.” Nguyen v.\nUnited States, 539 U.

Moreover, our reading\nof the court of appeals quorum provision was informed by\nthe longstanding practice of allowing two judges from the\ninitial panel to proceed to judgment in the case of a va\ncancy, see ibid., and as we have already explained, the\nBoard’s practice has been precisely the opposite.\n  Finally, we are not persuaded by the Government’s\nargument that we should read the statute to authorize the\nBoard to act with only two members in order to advance\nthe congressional objective of Board efficiency. Brief for\nRespondent 26. In the Government’s view, Congress’\nestablishment of the two-member quorum for a delegee\ngroup reflected its comfort with pre-Taft-Hartley practice,\nwhen the then-three-member Board regularly issued\ndecisions with only two members. Id., at 24. But it is\nunsurprising that two members regularly issued Board\ndecisions prior to Taft-Hartley, because the statute then\nprovided for a Board quorum of two. See 29 U. S. C.\n§153(b) (1946 ed.). Congress changed that requirement to\na three-member quorum for the Board. As we noted\nabove, if Congress had wanted to allow the Board to con\ntinue to operate with only two members, it could have kept\nthe Board quorum requirement at two.6\n——————\n   5 In any event, if the analogy to the appellate courts were correct,\n\nthen one might have to examine each Board decision individually.\nPetitioner’s case was not initially assigned to a three-member panel\nand thereafter decided by two members after one member had retired.\nInstead, by the time petitioner’s case came before the Board, Member\nKirsanow had long departed. In practical terms, petitioner’s case was\nboth assigned to and decided by a two-member delegee group.\n   6 We have no doubt that Congress intended “to preserve the ability of\n\ntwo members of the Board to exercise the Board’s full powers, in limited\ncircumstances,” post, at 12, as when a two-member quorum of a prop\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

Nor\ndo we have any reason to surmise that Congress’ overrid\ning objective in amending §3(b) was to keep the Board\noperating at all costs; the inclusion of the three-member\nquorum and delegation provisions indicate otherwise. Cf.\nRobert’s Rules of Order §3, p. 20 (10th ed. 2001) (“The\nrequirement of a quorum is a protection against totally\nunrepresentative action in the name of the body by an\nunduly small number of persons”).\n                             IV\n   In sum, we find that the Board quorum requirement and\nthe three-member delegation clause should not be read as\neasily surmounted technical obstacles of little to no im\nport. Our reading of the statute gives effect to those pro\nvisions without rendering any other provision of the stat\nute superfluous: The delegation clause still operates to\nallow the Board to act in panels of three, and the group\nquorum provision still operates to allow any panel to issue\na decision by only two members if one member is disquali\nfied. Our construction is also consistent with the Board’s\nlongstanding practice with respect to delegee groups. We\nthus hold that the delegation clause requires that a\ndelegee group maintain a membership of three in order to\nexercise the delegated authority of the Board.\n   We are not insensitive to the Board’s understandable\ndesire to keep its doors open despite vacancies.7 Nor are\n——————\nerly constituted delegee group issues a decision for the Board in a\nparticular case.

That state of affairs, to say the\nleast, was not ideal. This may be an underlying reason for\nthe Court’s conclusion. Despite the fact that the statute’s\nplain terms permit a two-member quorum of a properly\ndesignated three-member group to issue orders, the Court\nholds that the two-member quorum lost all authority to\nact once the third member left the Board. Under the\nCourt’s holding, the Board was unauthorized to resolve\nthe more than 500 cases it addressed during those 26\nmonths in the course of carrying out its responsibility “to\nremove obstructions to the free flow of commerce” through\n“the promotion of industrial peace.” NLRB v. Fansteel\nMetallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240, 257 (1939). This result\nis removed even farther from the ideal and from congres\nsional intent, as revealed in the statutory design. So it is\nhard to make the case that the Court’s interpretation of\nthe statute either furthers its most evident purposes or\nleads to the more sensible outcome.\n   Indeed, in my view, the objectives of the statute, which\n2            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nmust be to ensure orderly operations when the Board is\nnot at full strength as well as efficient operations when it\nis, are better respected by a statutory interpretation that\ndictates a result opposite to the one reached by the Court.\nAnd in all events, the outcome of the case is but a check on\nthe accuracy of the textual analysis; and here the text of\nthe statute, which must control, does not support the\nholding of the Court. These reasons, and those to be\nfurther discussed, inform this respectful dissent.\n                              I\n  The Board, by statute, consists of five members. 29\nU. S. C. §153(a). Section 153(b) provides a mechanism in\nwhich the Board can delegate all of its powers to a three\nmember group. As relevant here, the statute consists of\nthree parts. First, a delegation clause:\n    “The Board is authorized to delegate to any group of\n    three or more members any or all of the powers which\n    it may itself exercise.”\nThen, a vacancy clause:\n    “A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the right of\n    the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of\n    the Board . . . .”\nAnd finally, immediately following the vacancy clause, are\nthe Board and group quorum provisions:\n    “[A]nd three members of the Board shall, at all times,\n    constitute a quorum of the Board, except that two\n    members shall constitute a quorum of any group des\n    ignated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.”\n  As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 4, the three\nmember group of Members Liebman, Schaumber, and\nKirsanow were a “group designated pursuant to the first\nsentence” of §153(b). As such, a two-member quorum of\nthat group had statutory authorization to issue orders;\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nand that is precisely what Members Liebman and\nSchaumber did. Because the group was properly desig\nnated under §153(b) and a two-member quorum of the\ngroup was authorized to act under the statute’s plain\nterms, its actions were lawful. See Connecticut Nat. Bank\nv. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254 (1992) (“[I]n interpret\ning a statute a court should always turn first to one, car\ndinal canon before all others. . . . [C]ourts must presume\nthat a legislature says in a statute what it means and\nmeans in a statute what it says”).\n   Nothing in the statute suggests that a delegation to a\nthree-member group expires when one member’s seat\nbecomes vacant, as the Court holds today. In other con\ntexts, it is settled law that a vacancy in a delegee group\ndoes not void the initial delegation. See Nguyen v. United\nStates, 539 U. S. 69, 82 (2003) (concerning vacancies in\nthree-member panels of the courts of appeals). Any doubt\non that point should be resolved by this specific statutory\ninstruction: “A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the\nright of the remaining members to exercise all of the\npowers of the Board.” Members Liebman and Schaumber\nwere exercising the powers of the Board as its remaining\nmembers; yet the Court today holds that the vacancy\nimpaired their right to exercise those powers in hundreds\nof cases. That conclusion is contrary to the statutory\nmandate.\n   By its holding, the Court rejects a straightforward read\ning that it acknowledges is “textually permissible.” Ante,\nat 6. It does so because, in its view, it is “structurally\nimplausible.” Ante, at 6−7. But the only textually permis\nsible reading of §153(b) authorizes a two-member quorum\nof a delegee group to issue orders, as was done here; and\nin any event there is no structural implausibility in read\ning the statute according to its plain terms.\n4             NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                            II\n  The Court reads the statute to require a delegee group\nto maintain three members. Unable to find this require\nment in the statute’s text, the Court gives three reasons\nfor its interpretation. Those reasons do not withstand\nscrutiny.\n                                A\n  The first reason the Court gives for its interpretation is\nthat reading the statute to require a delegee group to\nmaintain three members “is the only way to harmonize\nand give meaningful effect to all of the provisions in”\n§153(b). Ante, at 5. This is not so. But it should be fur\nther noted that the argument advanced by the Court is not\nthat the Government’s interpretation of the statute ren\nders any provision superfluous or without a role to play in\nthe statutory scheme. Instead, the Court surmises that\ncertain provisions would not have “meaningful,” “mate\nrial,” or “practical” effect, ante, at 5, 6, 14. But that is just\nto say that the Court has determined, in its own judgment,\nthat some provisions should have a greater role than\nprovided by the text of the statute.\n  The Government’s reading of the statute does not render\nany clause meaningless. The full Board must have three\nor more members in order to conduct any business, includ\ning delegating its authority to a three-member group, as\nrequired under the Board quorum provision. This provi\nsion applies “at all times” to the Board acting as a whole.\nTwo members of the Board could not conduct any business\nunless they were previously designated by the full Board\nas members of a delegee group with such authority. Any\ndelegation of the Board’s authority must be to at least\nthree members, as required by the delegation clause. Any\ngroup to which the Board has properly delegated its au\nthority must have two members present to act, as required\nby the group quorum provision. This reading gives the\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

The Court would hold that two members of a group\ncan act as a quorum so long as the third’s absence is not\ndue to a vacancy; yet the vacancy clause makes it clear\nthat the authority of Board “members” to act shall not be\nimpaired by vacancies. The clause includes all members,\nincluding those acting as part of three-member groups.\n  The Court in effect would rewrite the group quorum\nprovision to say, “two members shall constitute a quorum\nof any group [unless the third member’s absence is due to\na vacancy].” Even if the statute said nothing about vacan\ncies, this would be a misreading of the quorum provision.\nA “quorum” is the “minimum number of members . . . who\nmust be present for a deliberative assembly to legally\ntransact business.” See Black’s Law Dictionary 1370 (9th\ned. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s). As the Court has made\nclear in the past, quorum requirements are generally\nindifferent to the reasons underlying any particular mem\nber’s absence. See Nguyen, 539 U. S., at 82.\n  For instance, the Court has previously discussed a\nstatute governing the delegation of power to three-member\npanels of the federal courts of appeals. Ibid. That statute\nprovides: “A majority of the number of judges authorized\nto constitute a court or panel thereof . . . shall constitute a\nquorum.” 28 U. S. C. §46(d). While the statute makes no\nmention of vacancies, the Court had little trouble conclud\ning that the statute “permits a quorum to proceed to\njudgment when one member of the panel dies or is dis\nqualified.” Nguyen, supra, at 82. The Court today offers\nto distinguish Nguyen as being “informed by the long\nstanding practice of allowing two judges from the initial\npanel to proceed to judgment in the case of a vacancy.”\n6            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 12. But there was little if any reliance on any\nsuch practice in Nguyen. In noting that its conclusion was\na matter of “settled law,” the Court relied on the text of\nthe statute and a single case that itself looked directly to\nthe statutory text of §46(d). Nguyen, supra, at 82 (citing\nUnited States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F. 2d 925,\n927 (CA2 1957) (L. Hand, J.)).\n  If the group quorum provision leaves any room for doubt\nthat it applies in cases of vacancy, its application is made\nclearer by the vacancy clause itself. That clause states in\nunequivocal terms that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall not\nimpair the right of the remaining members to exercise all\nof the powers of the Board.” §153(b). The Court makes\nmuch of the fact that the statute refers to a vacancy in the\n“Board” rather than in a “group.” But the former category\nsubsumes the latter. That is, the phrase “[a] vacancy in\nthe Board” covers the entire universe of instances in which\nthere may be a vacancy in a group, because all group\nmembers are Board members.\n  The Court counters that the vacancy clause “speaks to\nthe effect of a vacancy in the Board on the authority to\nexercise the powers of the Board,” ante, at 11, as opposed\nto a vacancy in a group. But the Court’s abridged re\nstatement of the vacancy clause suffers from a critical\nimprecision. The Court’s point would be well taken if the\nvacancy clause stated that “a vacancy in the Board shall\nnot affect the power of the Board to operate.” But the\nclause instead states that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall\nnot impair the right of the remaining members to exercise\nall of the powers of the Board.” Delegee groups consist of\nmembers exercising the powers of the Board. This clause\nthus instructs that a vacancy in the Board shall not im\npair the right of members to exercise the Board’s powers,\nan authority that members of delegee groups possess. But\nunder the Court’s reading, vacancies in the Board will\noften impair the right of the remaining members to exer\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ncise the powers of the Board, notwithstanding the explicit\nstatutory command to the contrary.\n   In an effort to avoid the mandates of the group quorum\nprovision, as buttressed by the vacancy clause, the Court\nrelies on the delegation clause. The Court reads the\nclause as requiring a delegee group to maintain three\nmembers in order for its authority to remain intact. In my\nrespectful submission, this reading of the statute, in which\nany vacancy in a delegee group somehow invalidates the\ndelegation itself, has no textual basis. Contrary to the\nCourt’s and petitioner’s assertions, the delegation clause is\nnot rendered unimportant under the Government’s inter\npretation. The delegation clause establishes what is re\nquired for delegation in the first instance, while the va\ncancy clause and the group quorum provision allow the\ndelegee group to proceed in the event that a member’s\nterm expires or a member resigns.\n   Congress could have required a delegee group to main\ntain three members, but it did not do so; instead, it in\ncluded a vacancy clause that is an explicit rejection of such\na requirement. That is no doubt why the Court’s reading\nhas not been adopted by the five Courts of Appeals to have\nrejected its result. See Teamsters Local Union No. 523 v.\nNLRB, 590 F. 3d 849 (CA10 2009); Narricot Indus., L. P.\nv. NLRB, 587 F. 3d 654 (CA4 2009); Snell Island SNF\nLLC v.

This animates the Court’s second reason for\ndeparting from the statutory text, as the Court suggests\nthat had Congress “intended to authorize two members\nalone to act for the Board on an ongoing basis, it could\nhave said so in straightforward language.” Ante, at 7. But\nCongress undoubtedly permitted two members to act for\nthe Board: Even under the Court’s interpretation, two\nmembers are authorized to exercise the full powers of the\nBoard so long as they are part of a delegee group that has\nfallen to two members due to any reason other than va\ncancy. Ante, at 13 (“[T]he group quorum provision still\noperates to allow any panel to issue a decision by only two\nmembers if one member is disqualified”).\n  The Court’s complaint, then, cannot be that Congress\ndid not intend two members to exercise the powers of the\nBoard; it must be that Congress did not intend to allow\ntwo members to do so for protracted periods of time. The\nCourt is likely correct that Congress did not expect a two\nmember quorum to operate as the Board for extended\nperiods, but unintended consequences are typically the\nresult of unforeseen circumstances. And it should be even\nmore evident that Congress did not intend the Board to\ncease operating entirely for an extended period of time, as\nthe Court’s interpretation of §153(b) now ordains.

There is nothing inconsistent about\nCongress preferring Board decisions to be made by three\nmembers and advancing that preference through statutory\nrequirements, while at the same time providing exceptions\nfor suboptimal circumstances, such as those presented\nhere. Quorum provisions do not express the legislature’s\njudgment about the optimal number of members that\nshould be present to transact business; they set a floor\nthat, while less than ideal, provides a minimum number of\nparticipants necessary to protect “against totally unrepre\nsentative action.” Robert’s Rules of Order §3, p. 16 (rev.\ned. 1970).\n  One likely reason Congress did not permit the Board to\ndelegate its authority to two-member groups in the first\ninstance is that Congress wanted to avoid two-member\ngroups in the mine run of cases. Congress’ statutory\nscheme achieved that goal, as the Court’s review of the\nBoard’s historical practices aptly demonstrates. Ante, at\n7−8. Congress nonetheless provided for two-member\nquorums to operate in extraordinary circumstances, where\n10           NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe Board has exercised its discretion to delegate its au\nthority to a particular three-member group, and one mem\nber of such a group is unavailable for whatever reason.\nThe Board’s delegation to a three-member group that\nultimately dwindled to two was a thoughtful and consid\nerate exercise of its reasonable discretion when it was\nconfronted with two imperfect alternatives.\n   During the past two years, events have turned what\nCongress had undoubtedly thought would be an extraordi\nnary circumstance into an ordinary one, through no fault\nof the Board. That is no reason to dispense with the statu\ntory regime that is prescribed when these circumstances\narise, even when they unexpectedly persist.\n                             C\n  The Court’s final reason for its interpretation is the\nBoard’s longstanding practice of reconstituting panels\nwhenever they drop below three members due to a va\ncancy. But see Photo-Sonics, Inc. v. NLRB, 678 F. 2d 121,\n122−123 (CA9 1982) (upholding decision from a two\nmember delegee group after third member retired). The\ncommonsense conclusion from this practice, however, is\nthat the Board respects the superiority of three-member\ngroups to two-member quorums of those groups. That the\nBoard reconstitutes its panels to include three members\ndoes not demonstrate that a two-member group lacks the\nauthority to act when recomposition is not an option.\n  The Court is mistaken, then, when it suggests that, if\ntwo-member quorums were permissible, the Board would\nhave a practice of allowing two-member quorums to per\nsist without reconstituting panels. Persuasive authority\nshows the contrary to be true. In 2003, the Office of Legal\nCounsel advised that two members can operate as a quo\nrum of a properly designated group, even if the other seats\non the Board are vacant. The Board agreed to be bound by\nthat opinion. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel,\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Six months later, Board Member Acosta resigned.\nSee NLRB Bulletin, Ronald Meisburg Receives Recess\nAppointment From President Bush to be NLRB Member\n(Dec. 29, 2003). Despite OLC’s opinion and the Board’s\nposition that two-member quorums could exercise the full\npowers of the Board, the Board prudently reconstituted\neach three-member panel on which Member Acosta served\nbefore his departure because there were enough members\nof the Board to do so. Its own prudent actions should not\nbe used as a reason to strip the Board of a statutory\npower.\n   And a further instructive history comes from the prac\ntices of the original Board, before the 1947 Taft-Hartley\nAct. The Wagner Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 451, provided for a\nthree-member Board and contained a vacancy provision\nsimilar to the one found in §153(b): “A vacancy in the\nBoard shall not impair the right of the remaining mem\nbers to exercise all the powers of the Board, and two mem\nbers of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a quorum.”\n§3(b), 49 Stat. 451. Under this statutory grant of author\nity, from 1935 to 1947 a two-member quorum of the Board\noperated during three separate periods when the third\nseat was vacant, issuing nearly 500 two-member decisions\nduring such times. Those two-member Boards issued 3\npublished decisions in 1936 (reported at 2 N. L. R. B.\n198−240); 237 published decisions in 1940 (reported at 27\nN. L. R. B. 1−1395 and 28 N. L. R. B. 1−115); and 225\npublished decisions in 1941 (reported at 35 N. L. R. B.\n24−1360 and 36 N. L. R. B. 1−45); see also Brief for Re\nspondent 3, n. 1.\n   Congress intended to preserve this practice when it\nenacted the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. The purpose of the\nTaft-Hartley amendment was to increase the Board’s\nefficiency by permitting multiple three-member groups to\nexercise the full powers of the Board. See S. Rep. No. 105,\n12           NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n80th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1947) (“The expansion of the\nBoard . . . would permit it to operate in panels of three,\nthereby increasing by 100 percent its ability to dispose of\ncases expeditiously”). In furtherance of that objective, the\nnew statutory language in §153(b) complements the con\ngressional intent to preserve the ability of two members of\nthe Board to exercise the Board’s full powers, in limited\ncircumstances, by permitting the Board to delegate “any or\nall” of its powers “to any group of three or more members,”\ntwo members of which would constitute a quorum.\n                              D\n   The petitioner, but not the Court, advances an alterna\ntive interpretation of §153(b) adopted by the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See\nBrief for Petitioner 16−27; Laurel Baye, 564 F. 3d 469. In\nthe petitioner’s view, §153(b) requires the Board to have a\nquorum of three members “at all times,” and when the\nBoard’s quorum fell to two members any powers that it\nhad delegated automatically ceased.\n   This is a misreading of the statute that the Court\nrightly declines to adopt. Ante, at 9−10, n. 4. As ex\nplained above, that the Board must meet a three-member\nquorum requirement at all times when it wishes to oper\nate as the full Board does not mean it must maintain three\nmembers in order for delegee groups to act. It just means\nthat the quorum requirement for the full Board, operating\nindependently of any delegee group, is fixed at three, as\nopposed to the various dynamic quorum requirements\nfound elsewhere in the United States Code. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. §46(d) (setting the quorum requirements for\ncourts of appeals at “[a] majority of the number of judges\nauthorized to constitute a court or panel thereof”); see also\nBlack’s 1370 (defining “proportional quorum” as: “A quo\nrum calculated with reference to some defined or assumed\nset, usu. either the number of seats (including vacancies)\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

For\ninstance, §153(d) permits the Board to delegate various\npowers to its general counsel, but under petitioner’s view\nthe general counsel would have lost all authority the\nmoment the Board fell to two members. See also §153(b)\n(permitting Board to delegate certain powers to its re\ngional directors). The Court’s assurances that its opinion\n“does not cast doubt on the prior delegations of authority\nto non-group members,” ante, at 10, n. 4, are cold comfort\nwhen it fails to reject petitioner’s view outright.\n                          *   *    *\n  It is not optimal for a two-member quorum to exercise\nthe full powers of the Board for an extended period of\ntime. But the desire to avoid that situation cannot justify\nthe Court’s significant revisions to §153(b): (1) It writes\nlanguage into the delegation clause, requiring delegee\ngroups to maintain a membership of three, despite the\nconspicuous absence of this requirement and the statutory\nrejection of it in the group quorum provision; (2) it excises\nthe word “not” from the vacancy clause, so that a Board\nvacancy does “impair the right of the remaining members\nto exercise all of the powers of the Board” in hundreds of\ncases; (3) it renders the group quorum provision unintelli\ngible, so that its application depends entirely on the rea\nson for the third member’s absence, and applies in all\ninstances except when the absence is due to a vacancy\n14           NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n(despite the vacancy clause’s contrary mandate, earlier in\nthe very same sentence).\n  The Court’s revisions leave the Board defunct for ex\ntended periods of time, a result that Congress surely did\nnot intend. The Court’s assurance that its interpretation\nis designed to give practical effect to the statute should\nbring it to the opposite result from the one it reaches.

Argued March 23, 2010—Decided June 17, 2010\nThe Taft-Hartley Act increased the size of the National Labor Relations\n  Board (Board) from three members to five, see 29 U. S. C. §153(a),\n  and amended §3(b) of the National Labor Relations Act to increase\n  the Board’s quorum requirement from two members to three and to\n  allow the Board to delegate its authority to groups of at least three\n  members, see §153(b). In December 2007, the Board—finding itself\n  with only four members and expecting two more vacancies—\n  delegated, inter alia, its powers to a group of three members. On De\n  cember 31, one group member’s appointment expired, but the others\n  proceeded to issue Board decisions for the next 27 months as a two\n  member quorum of a three-member group. Two of those decisions\n  sustained unfair labor practice complaints against petitioner, which\n  sought review, challenging the two-member Board’s authority to is\n  sue orders. The Seventh Circuit ruled for the Government, conclud\n  ing that the two members constituted a valid quorum of a three\n  member group to which the Board had legitimately delegated its\n  powers.\nHeld: Section 3(b) requires that a delegee group maintain a member\n ship of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the Board.\n Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) The first sentence of §3(b), the so-called delegation clause, au\n thorizes the Board to delegate its powers only to a “group of three or\n more members.” This clause is best read to require that the delegee\n group maintain a membership of three in order for the delegation to\n remain valid. First, that is the only way to harmonize and give\n meaningful effect to all of §3(b)’s provisions: (1) the delegation clause;\n (2) the vacancy clause, which provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board\n2                NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of\n    the powers of the Board”; (3) the Board quorum requirement, which\n    mandates that “three members of the Board shall, at all times, con\n    stitute a quorum of the Board”; and (4) the group quorum provision,\n    which provides that “two members shall constitute a quorum” of any\n    delegee group. This reading is consonant with the Board quorum re\n    quirement of three participating members “at all times,” and it gives\n    material effect to the delegation clause’s three-member rule. It also\n    permits the vacancy clause to operate to provide that vacancies do\n    not impair the Board’s ability to take action, so long as the quorum is\n    satisfied. And it does not render inoperative the group quorum pro\n    vision, which continues to authorize a properly constituted three\n    member delegee group to issue a decision with only two members\n    participating when one is disqualified from a case. The Govern\n    ment’s contrary reading allows two members to act as the Board ad\n    infinitum, dramatically undercutting the Board quorum require\n    ment’s significance by allowing its permanent circumvention. It also\n    diminishes the delegation clause’s three-member requirement by\n    permitting a de facto two-member delegation. By allowing the Board\n    to include a third member in the group for only one minute before her\n    term expires, this approach also gives no meaningful effect to the\n    command implicit in both the delegation clause and the Board quo\n    rum requirement that the Board’s full power be vested in no fewer\n    than three members. Second, had Congress intended to authorize\n    two members to act on an ongoing basis, it could have used straight\n    forward language. The Court’s interpretation is consistent with the\n    Board’s longstanding practice of reconstituting a delegee group when\n    one group member’s term expired. Pp. 4–9.\n      (b) The Government’s several arguments against the Court’s inter\n    pretation—that the group quorum requirement and vacancy clause\n    together permit two members of a three-member group to constitute\n    a quorum even when there is no third member; that the vacancy\n    clause establishes that a vacancy in the group has no effect; and that\n    reading the statute to authorize the Board to act with only two mem\n    bers advances the congressional objective of Board efficiency—are\n    unconvincing.

See 29 U. S. C. §153(a). Concur\nrent with that change, the Taft-Hartley Act amended §3(b)\nof the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to increase\nthe quorum requirement for the Board from two members\nto three, and to allow the Board to delegate its authority to\ngroups of at least three members. See §153(b). The ques\ntion in this case is whether, following a delegation of the\nBoard’s powers to a three-member group, two members\nmay continue to exercise that delegated authority once the\ngroup’s (and the Board’s) membership falls to two. We\nhold that two remaining Board members cannot exercise\nsuch authority.\n                              I\n   As 2007 came to a close, the Board found itself with four\nmembers and one vacancy. It anticipated two more vacan\ncies at the end of the year, when the recess appointments\nof Members Kirsanow and Walsh were set to expire, which\nwould leave the Board with only two members—too few to\n2            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmeet the Board’s quorum requirement, §153(b). The four\nsitting members decided to take action in an effort to\npreserve the Board’s authority to function. On December\n20, 2007, the Board made two delegations of its authority,\neffective as of midnight December 28, 2007. First, the\nBoard delegated to the general counsel continuing author\nity to initiate and conduct litigation that would normally\nrequire case-by-case approval of the Board. See Minute of\nBoard Action (Dec. 20, 2007), App. to Brief for Petitioner\n4a–5a (hereinafter Board Minutes). Second, the Board\ndelegated “to Members Liebman, Schaumber and Kir\nsanow, as a three-member group, all of the Board’s pow\ners, in anticipation of the adjournment of the 1st Session\nof the 110th Congress.” Id., at 5a. The Board expressed\nthe opinion that its action would permit the remaining two\nmembers to exercise the powers of the Board “after [the]\ndeparture of Members Kirsanow and Walsh, because the\nremaining Members will constitute a quorum of the three\nmember group.” Ibid.\n   The Board’s minutes explain that it relied on “the statu\ntory language” of §3(b), as well as an opinion issued by the\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC), for the proposition that the\nBoard may use this delegation procedure to “issue deci\nsions during periods when three or more of the five seats\non the Board are vacant.” Id., at 6a. The OLC had con\ncluded in 2003 that “if the Board delegated all of its pow\ners to a group of three members, that group could continue\nto issue decisions and orders as long as a quorum of two\nmembers remained.” Dept. of Justice, OLC, Quorum\nRequirements, App. to Brief for Respondent 3a. In seek\ning the OLC’s advice, the Board agreed to accept the\nOLC’s answer regarding its ability to operate with only\ntwo members, id., at 1a, n. 1, and the Board in its minutes\ntherefore “acknowledged that it is bound” by the OLC\nopinion. Board Minutes 6a. The Board noted, however,\nthat it was not bound to make this delegation; rather, it\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Ibid.\n   On December 28, 2007, the Board’s delegation to the\nthree-member group of Members Liebman, Schaumber,\nand Kirsanow became effective. On December 31, 2007,\nMember Kirsanow’s recess appointment expired. Thus,\nstarting on January 1, 2008, Members Liebman and\nSchaumber became the only members of the Board. They\nproceeded to issue decisions for the Board as a two\nmember quorum of a three-member group. The delegation\nautomatically terminated on March 27, 2010, when the\nPresident made two recess appointments to the Board,\nbecause the terms of the delegation specified that it would\nbe revoked when the Board’s membership returned to at\nleast three members, id., at 7a.\n   During the 27-month period in which the Board had\nonly two members, it decided almost 600 cases. See Letter\nfrom Elena Kagan, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter,\nClerk of Court (Apr. 26, 2010). One of those cases involved\npetitioner New Process Steel. In September 2008, the two\nmember Board issued decisions sustaining two unfair\nlabor practice complaints against petitioner. See New\nProcess Steel, LP, 353 N. L. R. B. No. 25 (2008); New Proc\ness Steel, LP, 353 N. L. R. B. No. 13 (2008). Petitioner\nsought review of both orders in the Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit, and challenged the authority of the\ntwo-member Board to issue the orders.\n   The court ruled in favor of the Government. After a\nreview of the text and legislative history of §3(b) and the\nsequence of events surrounding the delegation of authority\nin December 2007, the court concluded that the then\nsitting two members constituted a valid quorum of a\nthree-member group to which the Board had legitimately\ndelegated all its powers. 564 F. 3d 840, 845–847 (CA7\n2009).

A vacancy in the Board\n     shall not impair the right of the remaining members\n     to exercise all of the powers of the Board, and three\n     members of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a\n     quorum of the Board, except that two members shall\n     constitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant\n     to the first sentence hereof.” 29 U. S. C. §153(b).\n  It is undisputed that the first sentence of this provision\nauthorized the Board to delegate its powers to the three\nmember group effective on December 28, 2007, and the\nlast sentence authorized two members of that group to act\nas a quorum of the group during the next three days if, for\nexample, the third member had to recuse himself from a\nparticular matter. The question we face is whether those\ntwo members could continue to act for the Board as a\nquorum of the delegee group after December 31, 2007,\nwhen the Board’s membership fell to two and the desig\nnated three-member group of “Members Liebman,\nSchaumber, and Kirsanow” ceased to exist due to the\n——————\n  1 Several other Courts of Appeals reached the same conclusion as the\n\nSeventh Circuit, although not always following the same reasoning.\nSee Northeastern Land Servs., Ltd. v.

One interpretation, put forward by the Gov\nernment, would read the clause to require only that a\ndelegee group contain three members at the precise time\nthe Board delegates its powers, and to have no continuing\nrelevance after the moment of the initial delegation.\nUnder that reading, two members alone may exercise the\nfull power of the Board so long as they were part of a\ndelegee group that, at the time of its creation, included\nthree members. The other interpretation, by contrast,\nwould read the clause as requiring that the delegee group\nmaintain a membership of three in order for the delega\ntion to remain valid. Three main reasons support the\nlatter reading.\n   First, and most fundamentally, reading the delegation\nclause to require that the Board’s delegated power be\nvested continuously in a group of three members is the\nonly way to harmonize and give meaningful effect to all of\nthe provisions in §3(b). See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S.\n167, 174 (2001) (declining to adopt a “construction of the\nstatute, [that] would render [a term] insignificant”); Mar\nket Co. v. Hoffman, 101 U. S. 112, 115–116 (1879) (“[A]\nstatute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it\ncan be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be . . .\ninsignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those\nprovisions are: (1) the delegation clause; (2) the vacancy\nclause, which provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall\nnot impair the right of the remaining members to exercise\nall of the powers of the Board”; (3) the Board quorum\nrequirement, which mandates that “three members of the\n6            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBoard shall, at all times, constitute a quorum of the\nBoard”; and (4) the group quorum provision, which pro\nvides that “two members shall constitute a quorum” of any\ndelegee group. See §153(b).\n   Interpreting the statute to require the Board’s powers to\nbe vested at all times in a group of at least three members\nis consonant with the Board quorum requirement, which\nrequires three participating members “at all times” for the\nBoard to act. The interpretation likewise gives material\neffect to the three-member requirement in the delegation\nclause. The vacancy clause still operates to provide that\nvacancies do not impair the ability of the Board to take\naction, so long as the quorum is satisfied. And the inter\npretation does not render inoperative the group quorum\nprovision, which still operates to authorize a three\nmember delegee group to issue a decision with only two\nmembers participating, so long as the delegee group was\nproperly constituted. Reading §3(b) in this manner, the\nstatute’s various pieces hang together—a critical clue that\nthis reading is a sound one.\n   The contrary reading, on the other hand, allows two\nmembers to act as the Board ad infinitum, which dramati\ncally undercuts the significance of the Board quorum\nrequirement by allowing its permanent circumvention.\nThat reading also makes the three-member requirement\nin the delegation clause of vanishing significance, because\nit allows a de facto delegation to a two-member group, as\nhappened in this case. Under the Government’s approach,\nit would satisfy the statute for the Board to include a third\nmember in the group for only one minute before her term\nexpires; the approach gives no meaningful effect to the\ncommand implicit in both the delegation clause and in the\nBoard quorum requirement that the Board’s full power be\nvested in no fewer than three members. Hence, while the\nGovernment’s reading of the delegation clause is textually\npermissible in a narrow sense, it is structurally implausi\n                   Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)              7\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nble, as it would render two of §3(b)’s provisions function\nally void.\n   Second, and relatedly, if Congress had intended to\nauthorize two members alone to act for the Board on an\nongoing basis, it could have said so in straightforward\nlanguage. Congress instead imposed the requirement that\nthe Board delegate authority to no fewer than three mem\nbers, and that it have three participating members to\nconstitute a quorum. Those provisions are at best an\nunlikely way of conveying congressional approval of a two\nmember Board. Indeed, had Congress wanted to provide\nfor two members alone to act as the Board, it could have\nmaintained the NLRA’s original two-member Board quo\nrum provision, see 29 U. S. C. §153(b) (1946 ed.), or pro\nvided for a delegation of the Board’s authority to groups of\ntwo. The Rube Goldberg-style delegation mechanism\nemployed by the Board in 2007—delegating to a group of\nthree, allowing a term to expire, and then continuing with\na two-member quorum of a phantom delegee group—is\nsurely a bizarre way for the Board to achieve the authority\nto decide cases with only two members. To conclude that\nCongress intended to authorize such a procedure to con\ntravene the three-member Board quorum, we would need\nsome evidence of that intent.\n   The Government has not adduced any convincing evi\ndence on this front, and to the contrary, our interpretation\nis consistent with the longstanding practice of the Board.\nThis is the third factor driving our decision. Although the\nBoard has throughout its history allowed two members of\na three-member group to issue decisions when one mem\nber of a group was disqualified from a case, see Brief for\nRespondent 20; Board Minutes 6a, the Board has not\n(until recently) allowed two members to act as a quorum of\na defunct three-member group.2 Instead, the Board con\n——————\n 2 When   one member of a group is disqualified, only two members\n8               NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncedes that its practice was to reconstitute a delegee group\nwhen one group member’s term expired. Brief for Respon\ndent 39, n. 27.3 That our interpretation of the delegation\nprovision is consistent with the Board’s longstanding\npractice is persuasive evidence that it is the correct one,\nnotwithstanding the Board’s more recent view. See Bowen\nv. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 214 (1988).\n   In sum, a straightforward understanding of the text,\nwhich requires that no fewer than three members be\nvested with the Board’s full authority, coupled with the\nBoard’s longstanding practice, points us toward an inter\npretation of the delegation clause that requires a delegee\ngroup to maintain a membership of three.\n                            III\n  Against these points, the Government makes several\narguments that we find unconvincing. It first argues that\n§3(b) authorizes the Board’s action by its plain terms,\nnotwithstanding the somewhat fictional nature of the\ndelegation to a three-member group with the expectation\nthat within days it would become a two-member group. In\n——————\nactually participate in the decision. That circumstance thus also\npresents the problem of the possible inferiority of two-member deci\nsionmaking. That the Board found it necessary to reconstitute groups\nonly when there was a vacancy, and not when there was a disqualifica\ntion, suggests that its practice was driven by more than its belief in\nthe “superiority of three-member groups,” post, at 10 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting).\n   3 It also has not been the Board’s practice to issue decisions when the\n\nBoard’s membership has fallen to two. For about a 2-month period in\n1993–1994, and a 1-month period in 2001–2002, the Board had only\ntwo members and did not issue decisions. Brief for Respondent 5, n. 4.\nIn 2005, the Board did delegate its authority to a three-member group,\nof which two members issued a few orders as a quorum during a 3-day\nperiod in which the Board’s (and the group’s) membership fell below\nthree. Ibid. But the two-member Board at issue in this case, extending\nover two years, is unprecedented in the history of the post-Taft-Hartley\nBoard.\n                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nparticular, the Government contends the group quorum\nrequirement and the vacancy clause together make clear\nthat when the Board has delegated its power to a three\nmember group, “any two members of that group constitute\na quorum that may continue to exercise the delegated\npowers, regardless whether the third group member . . .\ncontinues to sit on the Board” and regardless “whether a\nquorum remains in the full Board.” Brief for Respondent\n17; see also id., at 20–23.\n  Although the group quorum provision clearly authorizes\ntwo members to act as a quorum of a “group designated\npursuant to the first sentence”—i.e., a group of at least\nthree members—it does not, by its plain terms, authorize\ntwo members to constitute a valid delegee group. A quo\nrum is the number of members of a larger body that must\nparticipate for the valid transaction of business. See\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1370 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\n“quorum” as the “minimum number of members . . . who\nmust be present for a deliberative assembly to legally\ntransact business”); 13 Oxford English Dictionary 51 (2d\ned. 1989) (“A fixed number of members of any body . . .\nwhose presence is necessary for the proper or valid trans\naction of business”); Webster’s New International Diction\nary 2046 (2d ed. 1954) (“Such a number of the officers or\nmembers of any body as is, when duly assembled, legally\ncompetent to transact business”). But the fact that there\nare sufficient members participating to constitute a quo\nrum does not necessarily establish that the larger body is\nproperly constituted or can validly exercise authority.4 In\n——————\n   4 Nor does failure to meet a quorum requirement necessarily establish\n\nthat an entity’s power is suspended so that it can be exercised by no\ndelegee. The requisite membership of an organization, and the number\nof members who must participate for it to take an action, are two\nseparate (albeit related) characteristics. Thus, although we reach the\nsame result, we do not adopt the District of Columbia Circuit’s equation\nof a quorum requirement with a membership requirement that must be\n10             NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nother words, that only two members must participate to\ntransact business in the name of the group, does not estab\nlish that the group itself can exercise the Board’s author\nity when the group’s membership falls below three.\n   The Government nonetheless contends that quorum\nrules “ordinarily” define the number of members that is\nboth necessary and sufficient for an entity to take an\naction. Brief for Respondent 20. Therefore, because of the\nquorum provision, if “at least two members of a delegee\ngroup actually participate in a decision . . . that should be\nthe end of the matter,” regardless of vacancies in the\ngroup or on the Board. Ibid. But even if quorum provi\nsions ordinarily provide the rule for dealing with vacan\ncies—i.e., even if they ordinarily make irrelevant any\nvacancies in the remainder of the larger body—the quo\nrum provisions in §3(b) do no such thing. Rather, there is\na separate clause addressing vacancies. The vacancy\nclause, recall, provides that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall\nnot impair the right of the remaining members to exercise\nall of the powers of the Board.” §153(b) (2006 ed.). We\nthus understand the quorum provisions merely to define\nthe number of members who must participate in a deci\n\n——————\nsatisfied or else the power of any entity to which the Board has dele\ngated authority is suspended. See Laurel Baye Healthcare of Lake\nLanier, Inc. v. NLRB, 564 F. 3d 469, 475 (2009) (“[T]he Board quorum\nprovision establishes that the power of the Board to act exists [only]\nwhen the Board consists of three members. The delegee group’s dele\ngated power to act . . . ceases when the Board’s membership dips below\nthe Board quorum of three members” (citation omitted)). The Board\nmay not, of course, itself take any action absent sufficient membership\nto muster a quorum (three), and in that sense a quorum requirement\nestablishes a minimum membership level. Our conclusion that the\ndelegee group ceases to exist once there are no longer three Board\nmembers to constitute the group does not cast doubt on the prior\ndelegations of authority to nongroup members, such as the regional\ndirectors or the general counsel. The latter implicates a separate\nquestion that our decision does not address.\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

But the\nclause speaks to the effect of a vacancy in the Board on the\nauthority to exercise the powers of the Board; it does not\nprovide a delegee group authority to act when there is a\nvacancy in the group. It is true that any vacancy in the\ngroup is necessarily also a vacancy in the Board (although\nthe converse is not true), and that a group exercises the\n(delegated) “powers of the Board.” But §3(b) explicitly\ndistinguishes between a group and the Board throughout,\nand in light of that distinction we do not think “Board”\nshould be read to include “group” when doing so would\nnegate for all practical purposes the command that\na delegation must be made to a group of at least three\nmembers.\n   Some courts have nonetheless interpreted the quorum\nand vacancy provisions of §3(b) by analogizing to an appel\nlate panel, which may decide a case even though only two\nof the three initially assigned judges remain on the panel.\nSee Photo-Sonics, Inc. v. NLRB, 678 F. 2d 121, 122–123\n(CA9 1982). The governing statute provides that a case\nmay be decided “by separate panels, each consisting of\nthree judges,” 28 U. S. C. §46(b), but that a “majority of\nthe number of judges authorized to constitute a court or\npanel thereof . . . shall constitute a quorum,” §46(d). We\nhave interpreted that statute to “requir[e] the inclusion of\nat least three judges in the first instance,” but to allow a\ntwo-judge “quorum to proceed to judgment when one\nmember of the panel dies or is disqualified.” Nguyen v.\nUnited States, 539 U. S. 69, 82 (2003). But §46, which\naddresses the assignment of particular cases to panels, is\na world apart from this statute, which authorizes the\nstanding delegation of all the Board’s powers to a small\n12             NEW PROCESS STEEL, L.

Moreover, our reading\nof the court of appeals quorum provision was informed by\nthe longstanding practice of allowing two judges from the\ninitial panel to proceed to judgment in the case of a va\ncancy, see ibid., and as we have already explained, the\nBoard’s practice has been precisely the opposite.\n  Finally, we are not persuaded by the Government’s\nargument that we should read the statute to authorize the\nBoard to act with only two members in order to advance\nthe congressional objective of Board efficiency. Brief for\nRespondent 26. In the Government’s view, Congress’\nestablishment of the two-member quorum for a delegee\ngroup reflected its comfort with pre-Taft-Hartley practice,\nwhen the then-three-member Board regularly issued\ndecisions with only two members. Id., at 24. But it is\nunsurprising that two members regularly issued Board\ndecisions prior to Taft-Hartley, because the statute then\nprovided for a Board quorum of two. See 29 U. S. C.\n§153(b) (1946 ed.). Congress changed that requirement to\na three-member quorum for the Board. As we noted\nabove, if Congress had wanted to allow the Board to con\ntinue to operate with only two members, it could have kept\nthe Board quorum requirement at two.6\n——————\n   5 In any event, if the analogy to the appellate courts were correct,\n\nthen one might have to examine each Board decision individually.\nPetitioner’s case was not initially assigned to a three-member panel\nand thereafter decided by two members after one member had retired.\nInstead, by the time petitioner’s case came before the Board, Member\nKirsanow had long departed. In practical terms, petitioner’s case was\nboth assigned to and decided by a two-member delegee group.\n   6 We have no doubt that Congress intended “to preserve the ability of\n\ntwo members of the Board to exercise the Board’s full powers, in limited\ncircumstances,” post, at 12, as when a two-member quorum of a prop\n                    Cite as: 560 U.

Nor\ndo we have any reason to surmise that Congress’ overrid\ning objective in amending §3(b) was to keep the Board\noperating at all costs; the inclusion of the three-member\nquorum and delegation provisions indicate otherwise. Cf.\nRobert’s Rules of Order §3, p. 20 (10th ed. 2001) (“The\nrequirement of a quorum is a protection against totally\nunrepresentative action in the name of the body by an\nunduly small number of persons”).\n                             IV\n   In sum, we find that the Board quorum requirement and\nthe three-member delegation clause should not be read as\neasily surmounted technical obstacles of little to no im\nport. Our reading of the statute gives effect to those pro\nvisions without rendering any other provision of the stat\nute superfluous: The delegation clause still operates to\nallow the Board to act in panels of three, and the group\nquorum provision still operates to allow any panel to issue\na decision by only two members if one member is disquali\nfied. Our construction is also consistent with the Board’s\nlongstanding practice with respect to delegee groups. We\nthus hold that the delegation clause requires that a\ndelegee group maintain a membership of three in order to\nexercise the delegated authority of the Board.\n   We are not insensitive to the Board’s understandable\ndesire to keep its doors open despite vacancies.7 Nor are\n——————\nerly constituted delegee group issues a decision for the Board in a\nparticular case. But we doubt “Congress intended to preserve” the pre-\nTaft-Hartley practice of two members acting for the Board when the\nthird seat was vacant, post, at 11, because it declined to preserve the\npre-Taft-Hartley two-member Board quorum.\n  7 Former Board members have identified turnover and vacancies as a\n14             NEW PROCESS STEEL, L.

But\nuntil it does, Congress’ decision to require that the Board’s\nfull power be delegated to no fewer than three members,\nand to provide for a Board quorum of three, must be given\npractical effect rather than swept aside in the face of\nadmittedly difficult circumstances. Section 3(b), as it\ncurrently exists, does not authorize the Board to create a\ntail that would not only wag the dog, but would continue\nto wag after the dog died.\n  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                   It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nsignificant impediment to the operations of the Board.

That state of affairs, to say the\nleast, was not ideal. This may be an underlying reason for\nthe Court’s conclusion. Despite the fact that the statute’s\nplain terms permit a two-member quorum of a properly\ndesignated three-member group to issue orders, the Court\nholds that the two-member quorum lost all authority to\nact once the third member left the Board. Under the\nCourt’s holding, the Board was unauthorized to resolve\nthe more than 500 cases it addressed during those 26\nmonths in the course of carrying out its responsibility “to\nremove obstructions to the free flow of commerce” through\n“the promotion of industrial peace.” NLRB v. Fansteel\nMetallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240, 257 (1939). This result\nis removed even farther from the ideal and from congres\nsional intent, as revealed in the statutory design. So it is\nhard to make the case that the Court’s interpretation of\nthe statute either furthers its most evident purposes or\nleads to the more sensible outcome.\n   Indeed, in my view, the objectives of the statute, which\n2            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nmust be to ensure orderly operations when the Board is\nnot at full strength as well as efficient operations when it\nis, are better respected by a statutory interpretation that\ndictates a result opposite to the one reached by the Court.\nAnd in all events, the outcome of the case is but a check on\nthe accuracy of the textual analysis; and here the text of\nthe statute, which must control, does not support the\nholding of the Court. These reasons, and those to be\nfurther discussed, inform this respectful dissent.\n                              I\n  The Board, by statute, consists of five members. 29\nU. S. C. §153(a). Section 153(b) provides a mechanism in\nwhich the Board can delegate all of its powers to a three\nmember group. As relevant here, the statute consists of\nthree parts. First, a delegation clause:\n    “The Board is authorized to delegate to any group of\n    three or more members any or all of the powers which\n    it may itself exercise.”\nThen, a vacancy clause:\n    “A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the right of\n    the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of\n    the Board . . . .”\nAnd finally, immediately following the vacancy clause, are\nthe Board and group quorum provisions:\n    “[A]nd three members of the Board shall, at all times,\n    constitute a quorum of the Board, except that two\n    members shall constitute a quorum of any group des\n    ignated pursuant to the first sentence hereof.”\n  As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 4, the three\nmember group of Members Liebman, Schaumber, and\nKirsanow were a “group designated pursuant to the first\nsentence” of §153(b). As such, a two-member quorum of\nthat group had statutory authorization to issue orders;\n                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nand that is precisely what Members Liebman and\nSchaumber did. Because the group was properly desig\nnated under §153(b) and a two-member quorum of the\ngroup was authorized to act under the statute’s plain\nterms, its actions were lawful. See Connecticut Nat. Bank\nv. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253–254 (1992) (“[I]n interpret\ning a statute a court should always turn first to one, car\ndinal canon before all others. . . . [C]ourts must presume\nthat a legislature says in a statute what it means and\nmeans in a statute what it says”).\n   Nothing in the statute suggests that a delegation to a\nthree-member group expires when one member’s seat\nbecomes vacant, as the Court holds today. In other con\ntexts, it is settled law that a vacancy in a delegee group\ndoes not void the initial delegation. See Nguyen v. United\nStates, 539 U. S. 69, 82 (2003) (concerning vacancies in\nthree-member panels of the courts of appeals). Any doubt\non that point should be resolved by this specific statutory\ninstruction: “A vacancy in the Board shall not impair the\nright of the remaining members to exercise all of the\npowers of the Board.” Members Liebman and Schaumber\nwere exercising the powers of the Board as its remaining\nmembers; yet the Court today holds that the vacancy\nimpaired their right to exercise those powers in hundreds\nof cases. That conclusion is contrary to the statutory\nmandate.\n   By its holding, the Court rejects a straightforward read\ning that it acknowledges is “textually permissible.” Ante,\nat 6. It does so because, in its view, it is “structurally\nimplausible.” Ante, at 6−7. But the only textually permis\nsible reading of §153(b) authorizes a two-member quorum\nof a delegee group to issue orders, as was done here; and\nin any event there is no structural implausibility in read\ning the statute according to its plain terms.\n4             NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                            II\n  The Court reads the statute to require a delegee group\nto maintain three members. Unable to find this require\nment in the statute’s text, the Court gives three reasons\nfor its interpretation. Those reasons do not withstand\nscrutiny.\n                                A\n  The first reason the Court gives for its interpretation is\nthat reading the statute to require a delegee group to\nmaintain three members “is the only way to harmonize\nand give meaningful effect to all of the provisions in”\n§153(b). Ante, at 5. This is not so. But it should be fur\nther noted that the argument advanced by the Court is not\nthat the Government’s interpretation of the statute ren\nders any provision superfluous or without a role to play in\nthe statutory scheme. Instead, the Court surmises that\ncertain provisions would not have “meaningful,” “mate\nrial,” or “practical” effect, ante, at 5, 6, 14. But that is just\nto say that the Court has determined, in its own judgment,\nthat some provisions should have a greater role than\nprovided by the text of the statute.\n  The Government’s reading of the statute does not render\nany clause meaningless. The full Board must have three\nor more members in order to conduct any business, includ\ning delegating its authority to a three-member group, as\nrequired under the Board quorum provision. This provi\nsion applies “at all times” to the Board acting as a whole.\nTwo members of the Board could not conduct any business\nunless they were previously designated by the full Board\nas members of a delegee group with such authority. Any\ndelegation of the Board’s authority must be to at least\nthree members, as required by the delegation clause. Any\ngroup to which the Board has properly delegated its au\nthority must have two members present to act, as required\nby the group quorum provision.

The Court would hold that two members of a group\ncan act as a quorum so long as the third’s absence is not\ndue to a vacancy; yet the vacancy clause makes it clear\nthat the authority of Board “members” to act shall not be\nimpaired by vacancies. The clause includes all members,\nincluding those acting as part of three-member groups.\n  The Court in effect would rewrite the group quorum\nprovision to say, “two members shall constitute a quorum\nof any group [unless the third member’s absence is due to\na vacancy].” Even if the statute said nothing about vacan\ncies, this would be a misreading of the quorum provision.\nA “quorum” is the “minimum number of members . . . who\nmust be present for a deliberative assembly to legally\ntransact business.” See Black’s Law Dictionary 1370 (9th\ned. 2009) (hereinafter Black’s). As the Court has made\nclear in the past, quorum requirements are generally\nindifferent to the reasons underlying any particular mem\nber’s absence. See Nguyen, 539 U. S., at 82.\n  For instance, the Court has previously discussed a\nstatute governing the delegation of power to three-member\npanels of the federal courts of appeals. Ibid. That statute\nprovides: “A majority of the number of judges authorized\nto constitute a court or panel thereof . . . shall constitute a\nquorum.” 28 U. S. C. §46(d). While the statute makes no\nmention of vacancies, the Court had little trouble conclud\ning that the statute “permits a quorum to proceed to\njudgment when one member of the panel dies or is dis\nqualified.” Nguyen, supra, at 82. The Court today offers\nto distinguish Nguyen as being “informed by the long\nstanding practice of allowing two judges from the initial\npanel to proceed to judgment in the case of a vacancy.”\n6            NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 12. But there was little if any reliance on any\nsuch practice in Nguyen. In noting that its conclusion was\na matter of “settled law,” the Court relied on the text of\nthe statute and a single case that itself looked directly to\nthe statutory text of §46(d). Nguyen, supra, at 82 (citing\nUnited States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F. 2d 925,\n927 (CA2 1957) (L. Hand, J.)).\n  If the group quorum provision leaves any room for doubt\nthat it applies in cases of vacancy, its application is made\nclearer by the vacancy clause itself. That clause states in\nunequivocal terms that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall not\nimpair the right of the remaining members to exercise all\nof the powers of the Board.” §153(b). The Court makes\nmuch of the fact that the statute refers to a vacancy in the\n“Board” rather than in a “group.” But the former category\nsubsumes the latter. That is, the phrase “[a] vacancy in\nthe Board” covers the entire universe of instances in which\nthere may be a vacancy in a group, because all group\nmembers are Board members.\n  The Court counters that the vacancy clause “speaks to\nthe effect of a vacancy in the Board on the authority to\nexercise the powers of the Board,” ante, at 11, as opposed\nto a vacancy in a group. But the Court’s abridged re\nstatement of the vacancy clause suffers from a critical\nimprecision. The Court’s point would be well taken if the\nvacancy clause stated that “a vacancy in the Board shall\nnot affect the power of the Board to operate.” But the\nclause instead states that “[a] vacancy in the Board shall\nnot impair the right of the remaining members to exercise\nall of the powers of the Board.” Delegee groups consist of\nmembers exercising the powers of the Board. This clause\nthus instructs that a vacancy in the Board shall not im\npair the right of members to exercise the Board’s powers,\nan authority that members of delegee groups possess. But\nunder the Court’s reading, vacancies in the Board will\noften impair the right of the remaining members to exer\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

The Court reads the\nclause as requiring a delegee group to maintain three\nmembers in order for its authority to remain intact. In my\nrespectful submission, this reading of the statute, in which\nany vacancy in a delegee group somehow invalidates the\ndelegation itself, has no textual basis. Contrary to the\nCourt’s and petitioner’s assertions, the delegation clause is\nnot rendered unimportant under the Government’s inter\npretation. The delegation clause establishes what is re\nquired for delegation in the first instance, while the va\ncancy clause and the group quorum provision allow the\ndelegee group to proceed in the event that a member’s\nterm expires or a member resigns.\n   Congress could have required a delegee group to main\ntain three members, but it did not do so; instead, it in\ncluded a vacancy clause that is an explicit rejection of such\na requirement. That is no doubt why the Court’s reading\nhas not been adopted by the five Courts of Appeals to have\nrejected its result. See Teamsters Local Union No. 523 v.\nNLRB, 590 F. 3d 849 (CA10 2009); Narricot Indus., L. P.\nv. NLRB, 587 F. 3d 654 (CA4 2009); Snell Island SNF\nLLC v.

While one court of appeals reached\nthe same result as the Court, it too did not adopt the\nCourt’s reasoning that a delegee group must maintain\nthree members.

NLRB\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nquirement into the statutory text bring me to its second\npoint.\n                              B\n  The Court’s textual arguments in the end reduce to a\nsingle objection: The Government’s reading of §153(b)\nallows two Board members to act as the full Board,\nthereby eviscerating the requirement that the Board only\noperate with a three-member quorum (or as three-member\npanels). This animates the Court’s second reason for\ndeparting from the statutory text, as the Court suggests\nthat had Congress “intended to authorize two members\nalone to act for the Board on an ongoing basis, it could\nhave said so in straightforward language.” Ante, at 7. But\nCongress undoubtedly permitted two members to act for\nthe Board: Even under the Court’s interpretation, two\nmembers are authorized to exercise the full powers of the\nBoard so long as they are part of a delegee group that has\nfallen to two members due to any reason other than va\ncancy. Ante, at 13 (“[T]he group quorum provision still\noperates to allow any panel to issue a decision by only two\nmembers if one member is disqualified”).\n  The Court’s complaint, then, cannot be that Congress\ndid not intend two members to exercise the powers of the\nBoard; it must be that Congress did not intend to allow\ntwo members to do so for protracted periods of time. The\nCourt is likely correct that Congress did not expect a two\nmember quorum to operate as the Board for extended\nperiods, but unintended consequences are typically the\nresult of unforeseen circumstances. And it should be even\nmore evident that Congress did not intend the Board to\ncease operating entirely for an extended period of time, as\nthe Court’s interpretation of §153(b) now ordains. Mem\nbers Liebman and Schaumber issued more than 500 opin\nions when they operated as a two-member quorum of a\nproperly designated group:\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

There is nothing inconsistent about\nCongress preferring Board decisions to be made by three\nmembers and advancing that preference through statutory\nrequirements, while at the same time providing exceptions\nfor suboptimal circumstances, such as those presented\nhere. Quorum provisions do not express the legislature’s\njudgment about the optimal number of members that\nshould be present to transact business; they set a floor\nthat, while less than ideal, provides a minimum number of\nparticipants necessary to protect “against totally unrepre\nsentative action.” Robert’s Rules of Order §3, p. 16 (rev.\ned. 1970).\n  One likely reason Congress did not permit the Board to\ndelegate its authority to two-member groups in the first\ninstance is that Congress wanted to avoid two-member\ngroups in the mine run of cases. Congress’ statutory\nscheme achieved that goal, as the Court’s review of the\nBoard’s historical practices aptly demonstrates. Ante, at\n7−8. Congress nonetheless provided for two-member\nquorums to operate in extraordinary circumstances, where\n10           NEW PROCESS STEEL, L. P. v. NLRB\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nthe Board has exercised its discretion to delegate its au\nthority to a particular three-member group, and one mem\nber of such a group is unavailable for whatever reason.\nThe Board’s delegation to a three-member group that\nultimately dwindled to two was a thoughtful and consid\nerate exercise of its reasonable discretion when it was\nconfronted with two imperfect alternatives.\n   During the past two years, events have turned what\nCongress had undoubtedly thought would be an extraordi\nnary circumstance into an ordinary one, through no fault\nof the Board. That is no reason to dispense with the statu\ntory regime that is prescribed when these circumstances\narise, even when they unexpectedly persist.\n                             C\n  The Court’s final reason for its interpretation is the\nBoard’s longstanding practice of reconstituting panels\nwhenever they drop below three members due to a va\ncancy. But see Photo-Sonics, Inc. v. NLRB, 678 F. 2d 121,\n122−123 (CA9 1982) (upholding decision from a two\nmember delegee group after third member retired). The\ncommonsense conclusion from this practice, however, is\nthat the Board respects the superiority of three-member\ngroups to two-member quorums of those groups. That the\nBoard reconstitutes its panels to include three members\ndoes not demonstrate that a two-member group lacks the\nauthority to act when recomposition is not an option.\n  The Court is mistaken, then, when it suggests that, if\ntwo-member quorums were permissible, the Board would\nhave a practice of allowing two-member quorums to per\nsist without reconstituting panels. Persuasive authority\nshows the contrary to be true. In 2003, the Office of Legal\nCounsel advised that two members can operate as a quo\nrum of a properly designated group, even if the other seats\non the Board are vacant. The Board agreed to be bound by\nthat opinion. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel,\n                 Cite as: 560 U.

Six months later, Board Member Acosta resigned.\nSee NLRB Bulletin, Ronald Meisburg Receives Recess\nAppointment From President Bush to be NLRB Member\n(Dec. 29, 2003). Despite OLC’s opinion and the Board’s\nposition that two-member quorums could exercise the full\npowers of the Board, the Board prudently reconstituted\neach three-member panel on which Member Acosta served\nbefore his departure because there were enough members\nof the Board to do so. Its own prudent actions should not\nbe used as a reason to strip the Board of a statutory\npower.\n   And a further instructive history comes from the prac\ntices of the original Board, before the 1947 Taft-Hartley\nAct. The Wagner Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 451, provided for a\nthree-member Board and contained a vacancy provision\nsimilar to the one found in §153(b): “A vacancy in the\nBoard shall not impair the right of the remaining mem\nbers to exercise all the powers of the Board, and two mem\nbers of the Board shall, at all times, constitute a quorum.”\n§3(b), 49 Stat. 451. Under this statutory grant of author\nity, from 1935 to 1947 a two-member quorum of the Board\noperated during three separate periods when the third\nseat was vacant, issuing nearly 500 two-member decisions\nduring such times. Those two-member Boards issued 3\npublished decisions in 1936 (reported at 2 N. L. R. B.\n198−240); 237 published decisions in 1940 (reported at 27\nN. L. R. B. 1−1395 and 28 N. L. R. B. 1−115); and 225\npublished decisions in 1941 (reported at 35 N. L. R. B.\n24−1360 and 36 N. L. R. B. 1−45); see also Brief for Re\nspondent 3, n. 1.\n   Congress intended to preserve this practice when it\nenacted the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. The purpose of the\nTaft-Hartley amendment was to increase the Board’s\nefficiency by permitting multiple three-member groups to\nexercise the full powers of the Board. See S. Rep.

In furtherance of that objective, the\nnew statutory language in §153(b) complements the con\ngressional intent to preserve the ability of two members of\nthe Board to exercise the Board’s full powers, in limited\ncircumstances, by permitting the Board to delegate “any or\nall” of its powers “to any group of three or more members,”\ntwo members of which would constitute a quorum.\n                              D\n   The petitioner, but not the Court, advances an alterna\ntive interpretation of §153(b) adopted by the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. See\nBrief for Petitioner 16−27; Laurel Baye, 564 F. 3d 469. In\nthe petitioner’s view, §153(b) requires the Board to have a\nquorum of three members “at all times,” and when the\nBoard’s quorum fell to two members any powers that it\nhad delegated automatically ceased.\n   This is a misreading of the statute that the Court\nrightly declines to adopt. Ante, at 9−10, n. 4. As ex\nplained above, that the Board must meet a three-member\nquorum requirement at all times when it wishes to oper\nate as the full Board does not mean it must maintain three\nmembers in order for delegee groups to act. It just means\nthat the quorum requirement for the full Board, operating\nindependently of any delegee group, is fixed at three, as\nopposed to the various dynamic quorum requirements\nfound elsewhere in the United States Code. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. §46(d) (setting the quorum requirements for\ncourts of appeals at “[a] majority of the number of judges\nauthorized to constitute a court or panel thereof”); see also\nBlack’s 1370 (defining “proportional quorum” as: “A quo\nrum calculated with reference to some defined or assumed\nset, usu. either the number of seats (including vacancies)\n                  Cite as: 560 U.

For\ninstance, §153(d) permits the Board to delegate various\npowers to its general counsel, but under petitioner’s view\nthe general counsel would have lost all authority the\nmoment the Board fell to two members. See also §153(b)\n(permitting Board to delegate certain powers to its re\ngional directors). The Court’s assurances that its opinion\n“does not cast doubt on the prior delegations of authority\nto non-group members,” ante, at 10, n. 4, are cold comfort\nwhen it fails to reject petitioner’s view outright.\n                          *   *    *\n  It is not optimal for a two-member quorum to exercise\nthe full powers of the Board for an extended period of\ntime. But the desire to avoid that situation cannot justify\nthe Court’s significant revisions to §153(b): (1) It writes\nlanguage into the delegation clause, requiring delegee\ngroups to maintain a membership of three, despite the\nconspicuous absence of this requirement and the statutory\nrejection of it in the group quorum provision; (2) it excises\nthe word “not” from the vacancy clause, so that a Board\nvacancy does “impair the right of the remaining members\nto exercise all of the powers of the Board” in hundreds of\ncases; (3) it renders the group quorum provision unintelli\ngible, so that its application depends entirely on the rea\nson for the third member’s absence, and applies in all\ninstances except when the absence is due to a vacancy\n14           NEW PROCESS STEEL, L.
