GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u2013475.      Argued April 27, 2010\u2014Decided June 21, 2010\nThe Plant Protection Act (PPA) provides that the Secretary of the De\n  partment of Agriculture may issue regulations \u201cto prevent the intro\n  duction of plant pests into the United States or the dissemination of\n  plant pests within the United States.\u201d 7 U. S. C. \u00a77711(a). Pursuant\n  to that grant of authority, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\n  Service (APHIS) promulgated regulations that presume genetically\n  engineered plants to be \u201cplant pests\u201d\u2014and thus \u201cregulated articles\u201d\n  under the PPA\u2014until APHIS determines otherwise. However, any\n  person may petition APHIS for a determination that a regulated arti\n  cle does not present a plant pest risk and therefore should not be sub\n  ject to the applicable regulations. APHIS may grant such a petition\n  in whole or in part.\n     In determining whether to grant nonregulated status to a geneti\n  cally engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply with the Na\n  tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires fed\n  eral agencies \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d to prepare a detailed\n  environmental impact statement (EIS) for \u201cevery . . . major Federal\n  actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environ\n  ment.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C). The agency need not complete an\n  EIS if it finds, based on a shorter statement known as an environ\n  mental assessment (EA), that the proposed action will not have a\n  significant environmental impact.\n     This case involves a challenge to APHIS\u2019s decision to approve the\n  unconditional deregulation of Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a vari\n  ety of alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to tolerate the her\n  bicide Roundup. Petitioners are the owner and the licensee of the in\n  tellectual property rights to RRA. In response to petitioners\u2019\n2            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    deregulation request, APHIS prepared a draft EA and solicited public\n    comments on its proposed course of action. Based on its EA and the\n    comments submitted, the agency determined that the introduction of\n    RRA would not have any significant adverse impact on the environ\n    ment. Accordingly, APHIS decided to deregulate RRA uncondition\n    ally and without preparing an EIS. Respondents, conventional al\n    falfa growers and environmental groups, filed this action challenging\n    that decision on the ground that it violated NEPA and other federal\n    laws. The District Court held, inter alia, that APHIS violated NEPA\n    when it deregulated RRA without first completing a detailed EIS. To\n    remedy that violation, the court vacated the agency\u2019s decision com\n    pletely deregulating RRA; enjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA,\n    in whole or in part, pending completion of the EIS; and entered a na\n    tionwide permanent injunction prohibiting almost all future planting\n    of RRA during the pendency of the EIS process. Petitioners and the\n    Government appealed, challenging the scope of the relief granted but\n    not disputing that APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision violated NEPA.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding, among other things, that the\n    District Court had not abused its discretion in rejecting APHIS\u2019s pro\n    posed mitigation measures in favor of a broader injunction.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents have standing to seek injunctive relief, and peti\n tioners have standing to seek this Court\u2019s review of the Ninth Cir\n cuit\u2019s judgment affirming the entry of such relief. Pp. 7\u201314.\n       (a) Petitioners have constitutional standing to seek review here.\n Article III standing requires an injury that is (i) concrete, particular\n ized, and actual or imminent, (ii) fairly traceable to the challenged\n action, and (iii) redressable by a favorable ruling. See Horne v. Flo\n res, 557 U. S. ___, ___. Petitioners satisfy all three criteria. Petition\n ers are injured by their inability to sell or license RRA to prospective\n customers until APHIS completes the EIS. Because that injury is\n caused by the very remedial order that petitioners challenge on ap\n peal, it would be redressed by a favorable ruling from this Court. Re\n spondents nevertheless contend that petitioners lack standing be\n cause their complained-of injury is independently caused by a part of\n the District Court\u2019s order that petitioners failed to challenge, the va\n catur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision. That argument fails for two\n independent reasons. First, one of the main disputes between the\n parties throughout this litigation has been whether the District\n Court should have adopted APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment, which would\n have replaced the vacated deregulation decision with an order ex\n pressly authorizing the continued sale and planting of RRA. Accord\n ingly, if the District Court had adopted APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment,\n there would still be authority for the continued sale of RRA notwith\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nstanding the District Court\u2019s vacatur, because there would, in effect,\nbe a new deregulation decision. Second, petitioners in any case have\nstanding to challenge the part of the District Court\u2019s order enjoining\na partial deregulation. Respondents focus their argument on the part\nof the judgment that enjoins planting, but the judgment also states\nthat before granting the deregulation petition, even in part, the\nagency must prepare an EIS. That part of the judgment inflicts an\ninjury not also caused by the vacatur. Pp. 7\u201311.\n      (b) Respondents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive\nrelief from the complete deregulation order at issue here. The Court\ndisagrees with petitioners\u2019 argument that respondents have failed to\nshow that any of them is likely to suffer a constitutionally cognizable\ninjury absent injunctive relief. The District Court found that respon\ndent farmers had established a reasonable probability that their con\nventional alfalfa crops would be infected with the engineered\nRoundup Ready gene if RRA were completely deregulated. A sub\nstantial risk of such gene flow injures respondents in several ways\nthat are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the\nconstitutional standing analysis. Moreover, those harms are readily\nattributable to APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision, which gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered alfalfa va\nrieties. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting the planting or deregula\ntion of all or some genetically engineered alfalfa would redress re\nspondents\u2019 injuries by eliminating or minimizing the risk of gene flow\nto their crops. Pp. 11\u201314.\n   2. The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from\neffecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of\nRRA pending the agency\u2019s completion of its detailed environmental\nreview. Pp. 14\u201322.\n      (a) Because petitioners and the Government do not argue other\nwise, the Court assumes without deciding that the District Court\nacted lawfully in vacating the agency\u2019s decision to completely deregu\nlate RRA. The Court therefore addresses only the injunction prohib\niting APHIS from deregulating RRA pending completion of the EIS,\nand the nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all RRA planting\nduring the pendency of the EIS process. P. 14.\n      (b) Before a court may grant a permanent injunction, the plain\ntiff must satisfy a four-factor test, demonstrating: \u201c(1) that it has suf\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such\nas monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury;\n(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff\nand defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the pub\nlic interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\u201d eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391. This test fully ap\n4            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    plies in NEPA cases. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\n    cil, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___. Thus, the existence of a NEPA violation\n    does not create a presumption that injunctive relief is available and\n    should be granted absent unusual circumstances. Pp. 15\u201316.\n          (c) None of the four factors supports the District Court\u2019s order en\n    joining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during the pendency\n    of the EIS process. Most importantly, respondents cannot show that\n    they will suffer irreparable injury if APHIS is allowed to proceed with\n    any partial deregulation, for at least two reasons. First, if and when\n    APHIS pursues a partial deregulation that arguably runs afoul of\n    NEPA, respondents may file a new suit challenging such action and\n    seeking appropriate preliminary relief. Accordingly, a permanent in\n    junction is not now needed to guard against any present or imminent\n    risk of likely irreparable harm. Second, a partial deregulation need\n    not cause respondents any injury at all; if its scope is sufficiently lim\n    ited, the risk of gene flow could be virtually nonexistent. Indeed, the\n    broad injunction entered below essentially pre-empts the very proce\n    dure by which APHIS could determine, independently of the pending\n    EIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregulation, that\n    a limited deregulation would not pose any appreciable risk of envi\n    ronmental harm. Pp. 16\u201323.\n          (d) The District Court also erred in entering the nationwide in\n    junction against planting RRA, for two independent reasons. First,\n    because it was inappropriate for the District Court to foreclose even\n    the possibility of a partial and temporary deregulation, it follows that\n    it was inappropriate to enjoin planting in accordance with such a de\n    regulation decision. Second, an injunction is a drastic and extraordi\n    nary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. See,\n    e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312. If, as respon\n    dents now concede, a less drastic remedy (such as partial or complete\n    vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision) was sufficient to redress\n    their injury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of\n    an injunction was warranted. Pp. 23\u201324.\n          (e) Given the District Court\u2019s errors, this Court need not address\n    whether injunctive relief of some kind was available to respondents\n    on the record below.

The District\nCourt held that APHIS violated the National Environ\u00ad\nmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a74321 et seq., by issuing its deregulation deci\u00ad\nsion without first completing a detailed assessment of\nthe environmental consequences of its proposed course of\naction. To remedy that violation, the District Court\nvacated the agency\u2019s decision completely deregulating\nthe alfalfa variety in question; ordered APHIS not to act\non the deregulation petition in whole or in part until it\nhad completed a detailed environmental review; and\nenjoined almost all future planting of the genetically\nengineered alfalfa pending the completion of that review.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s entry\nof permanent injunctive relief. The main issue now in\ndispute concerns the breadth of that relief. For the\nreasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Plant Protection Act (PPA), 114 Stat. 438, 7 U. S. C.\n\u00a77701 et seq., provides that the Secretary of the Depart\u00ad\nment of Agriculture (USDA) may issue regulations \u201cto\nprevent the introduction of plant pests into the United\nStates or the dissemination of plant pests within the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a77711(a). The Secretary has delegated\nthat authority to APHIS, a division of the USDA. 7 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a72.22(a), 2.80(a)(36) (2010). Acting pursuant to that\ndelegation, APHIS has promulgated regulations governing\n\u201cthe introduction of organisms and products altered or\nproduced through genetic engineering that are plant pests\nor are believed to be plant pests.\u201d See \u00a7340.0(a)(2) and\nn. 1. Under those regulations, certain genetically engi\u00ad\nneered plants are presumed to be \u201cplant pests\u201d\u2014and thus\n\u201cregulated articles\u201d under the PPA\u2014until APHIS deter\u00ad\nmines otherwise. See ibid.; \u00a7\u00a7340.1, 340.2, 340.6; see also\nApp. 183. However, any person may petition APHIS for a\ndetermination that a regulated article does not present a\nplant pest risk and therefore should not be subject to the\napplicable regulations. 7 U. S. C. \u00a77711(c)(2); 7 CFR\n\u00a7340.6. APHIS may grant such a petition in whole or in\npart. \u00a7340.6(d)(3).\n  In deciding whether to grant nonregulated status to a\ngenetically engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply\nwith NEPA, which requires federal agencies \u201cto the fullest\nextent possible\u201d to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement (EIS) for \u201cevery recommendation or report on\nproposals for legislation and other major Federal actio[n]\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environ\u00ad\nment.\u201d    42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C).     The statutory text\n\u201cspeaks solely in terms of proposed actions; it does not\nrequire an agency to consider the possible environmental\nimpacts of less imminent actions when preparing the\nimpact statement on proposed actions.\u201d Kleppe v. Sierra\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 410, n. 20 (1976).\n  An agency need not complete an EIS for a particular\nproposal if it finds, on the basis of a shorter \u201cenviron\u00ad\nmental assessment\u201d (EA), that the proposed action will not\nhave a significant impact on the environment. 40 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71508.9(a), 1508.13 (2009). Even if a particular agency\nproposal requires an EIS, applicable regulations allow the\nagency to take at least some action in furtherance of that\nproposal while the EIS is being prepared. See \u00a71506.1(a)\n(\u201cno action concerning the proposal shall be taken which\nwould: (1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or (2)\nLimit the choice of reasonable alternatives\u201d); \u00a71506.1(c)\n(\u201cWhile work on a required program environmental impact\nstatement is in progress and the action is not covered by\nan existing program statement, agencies shall not under\u00ad\ntake in the interim any major Federal action covered by\nthe program which may significantly affect the quality of\nthe human environment unless such action\u201d satisfies\ncertain requirements).\n                             B\n   This case involves Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a kind\nof alfalfa crop that has been genetically engineered to be\ntolerant of glyphosate, the active ingredient of the herbi\u00ad\ncide Roundup. Petitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto)\nowns the intellectual property rights to RRA. Monsanto\nlicenses those rights to co-petitioner Forage Genetics\nInternational (FGI), which is the exclusive developer of\nRRA seed.\n   APHIS initially classified RRA as a regulated article,\nbut in 2004 petitioners sought nonregulated status for two\nstrains of RRA. In response, APHIS prepared a draft EA\nassessing the likely environmental impact of the requested\nderegulation. It then published a notice in the Federal\nRegister advising the public of the deregulation petition\nand soliciting public comments on its draft EA. After\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsidering the hundreds of public comments that it re\u00ad\nceived, APHIS issued a Finding of No Significant Impact\nand decided to deregulate RRA unconditionally and with\u00ad\nout preparing an EIS. Prior to this decision, APHIS had\nauthorized almost 300 field trials of RRA conducted over a\nperiod of eight years. App. 348.\n   Approximately eight months after APHIS granted RRA\nnonregulated status, respondents (two conventional alfalfa\nseed farms and environmental groups concerned with food\nsafety) filed this action against the Secretary of Agricul\u00ad\nture and certain other officials in Federal District Court,\nchallenging APHIS\u2019s decision to completely deregulate\nRRA. Their complaint alleged violations of NEPA, the\nEndangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 87 Stat. 884, 16\nU. S. C. \u00a71531 et seq., and the PPA. Respondents did not\nseek preliminary injunctive relief pending resolution of\nthose claims. Hence, RRA enjoyed nonregulated status for\napproximately two years. During that period, more than\n3,000 farmers in 48 States planted an estimated 220,000\nacres of RRA. App. 350.\n   In resolving respondents\u2019 NEPA claim, the District\nCourt accepted APHIS\u2019s determination that RRA does not\nhave any harmful health effects on humans or livestock.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 43a; accord, id., at 45a. Neverthe\u00ad\nless, the District Court held that APHIS violated NEPA by\nderegulating RRA without first preparing an EIS. In\nparticular, the court found that APHIS\u2019s EA failed to\nanswer substantial questions concerning two broad conse\u00ad\nquences of its proposed action: first, the extent to which\ncomplete deregulation would lead to the transmission of\nthe gene conferring glyphosate tolerance from RRA to\norganic and conventional alfalfa; and, second, the extent to\nwhich the introduction of RRA would contribute to the\ndevelopment of Roundup-resistant weeds. Id., at 52a. In\nlight of its determination that the deregulation decision\nran afoul of NEPA, the District Court dismissed without\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudice respondents\u2019 claims under the ESA and PPA.\n   After these rulings, the District Court granted petition\u00ad\ners permission to intervene in the remedial phase of the\nlawsuit. The court then asked the parties to submit pro\u00ad\nposed judgments embodying their preferred means of\nremedying the NEPA violation. APHIS\u2019s proposed judg\u00ad\nment would have ordered the agency to prepare an EIS,\nvacated the agency\u2019s deregulation decision, and replaced\nthat decision with the terms of the judgment itself. Id., at\n184a (proposed judgment providing that \u201c[the federal]\ndefendants\u2019 [June 14,] 2005 Determination of Nonregu\u00ad\nlated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered for Toler\u00ad\nance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby vacated and\nreplaced by the terms of this judgment\u201d (emphasis added)).\nThe terms of the proposed judgment, in turn, would have\npermitted the continued planting of RRA pending comple\u00ad\ntion of the EIS, subject to six restrictions. Those restric\u00ad\ntions included, among other things, mandatory isolation\ndistances between RRA and non-genetically-engineered\nalfalfa fields in order to mitigate the risk of gene flow;\nmandatory harvesting conditions; a requirement that\nplanting and harvesting equipment that had been in\ncontact with RRA be cleaned prior to any use with conven\u00ad\ntional or organic alfalfa; identification and handling re\u00ad\nquirements for RRA seed; and a requirement that all RRA\nseed producers and hay growers be under contract with\neither Monsanto or FGI and that their contracts require\ncompliance with the other limitations set out in the pro\u00ad\nposed judgment.\n   The District Court rejected APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment.\nIn its preliminary injunction, the District Court prohibited\nalmost all future planting of RRA pending APHIS\u2019s com\u00ad\npletion of the required EIS. But in order to minimize the\nharm to farmers who had relied on APHIS\u2019s deregulation\ndecision, the court expressly allowed those who had al\u00ad\nready purchased RRA to plant their seeds until March 30,\n6        MONSANTO CO. v.

In its subsequently entered permanent\ninjunction and judgment, the court (1) vacated APHIS\u2019s\nderegulation decision; (2) ordered APHIS to prepare an\nEIS before it made any decision on Monsanto\u2019s deregula\u00ad\ntion petition; (3) enjoined the planting of any RRA in the\nUnited States after March 30, 2007, pending APHIS\u2019s\ncompletion of the required EIS; and (4) imposed certain\nconditions (suggested by APHIS) on the handling and\nidentification of already-planted RRA. Id., at 79a, 109a.\nThe District Court denied petitioners\u2019 request for an evi\u00ad\ndentiary hearing.\n   The Government, Monsanto, and FGI appealed, chal\u00ad\nlenging the scope of the relief granted but not disputing\nthe existence of a NEPA violation. See Geertson Seed\nFarms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130, 1136 (2009). A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af\u00ad\nfirmed. Based on its review of the record, the panel first\nconcluded that the District Court had \u201crecognized that an\ninjunction does not \u2018automatically issue\u2019 when a NEPA\nviolation is found\u201d and had instead based its issuance of\ninjunctive relief on the four-factor test traditionally used\nfor that purpose. Id., at 1137. The panel held that the\nDistrict Court had not committed clear error in making\nany of the subsidiary factual findings on which its assess\u00ad\nment of the four relevant factors was based. And the\npanel rejected the claim that the District Court had not\ngiven sufficient deference to APHIS\u2019s expertise concerning\nthe likely effects of allowing continued planting of RRA on\na limited basis. In the panel\u2019s view, APHIS\u2019s proposed\ninterim measures would have perpetuated a system that\nhad been found by the District Court to have caused envi\u00ad\nronmental harm in the past. Id., at 1139. Hence, the\npanel concluded that the District Court had not abused its\ndiscretion \u201cin choosing to reject APHIS\u2019s proposed mitiga\u00ad\ntion measures in favor of a broader injunction to prevent\nmore irreparable harm from occurring.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The panel majority also rejected petitioners\u2019 alternative\nargument that the District Court had erred in declining to\nhold an evidentiary hearing before entering its permanent\ninjunction. Writing in dissent, Judge N. Randy Smith\ndisagreed with that conclusion. In his view, the District\nCourt was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing\nbefore issuing a permanent injunction unless the facts\nwere undisputed or the adverse party expressly waived its\nright to such a hearing. Neither of those two exceptions,\nhe found, applied here.\n  We granted certiorari. 558 U. S. __ (2010).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   At the threshold, respondents contend that petitioners\nlack standing to seek our review of the lower court rulings\nat issue here. We disagree.\n   Standing under Article III of the Constitution requires\nthat an injury be concrete, particularized, and actual or\nimminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and\nredressable by a favorable ruling. Horne v. Flores, 557\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Petitioners here sat\u00ad\nisfy all three criteria. Petitioners are injured by their\ninability to sell or license RRA to prospective customers\nuntil such time as APHIS completes the required EIS.\nBecause that injury is caused by the very remedial order\nthat petitioners challenge on appeal, it would be redressed\nby a favorable ruling from this Court.\n   Respondents do not dispute that petitioners would have\nstanding to contest the District Court\u2019s permanent injunc\u00ad\ntion order if they had pursued a different litigation strat\u00ad\negy. Instead, respondents argue that the injury of which\npetitioners complain is independently caused by a part of\nthe District Court\u2019s order that petitioners failed to chal\u00ad\nlenge, namely, the vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation deci\u00ad\nsion. The practical consequence of the vacatur, respon\u00ad\n8        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndents contend, was to restore RRA to the status of a regu\u00ad\nlated article; and, subject to certain exceptions not appli\u00ad\ncable here, federal regulations ban the growth and sale of\nregulated articles. Because petitioners did not specifically\nchallenge the District Court\u2019s vacatur, respondents reason,\nthey lack standing to challenge a part of the District\nCourt\u2019s order (i.e., the injunction) that does not cause\npetitioners any injury not also caused by the vacatur. See\nBrief for Respondents 19\u201320.\n   Respondents\u2019 argument fails for two independent rea\u00ad\nsons. First, although petitioners did not challenge the\nvacatur directly, they adequately preserved their objection\nthat the vacated deregulation decision should have been\nreplaced by APHIS\u2019s proposed injunction. Throughout the\nremedial phase of this litigation, one of the main disputes\nbetween the parties has been whether the District Court\nwas required to adopt APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment. See,\ne.g., Intervenor-Appellants\u2019 Opening Brief in No. 07\u201316458\netc. (CA9), p. 59 (urging the Court of Appeals to \u201cvacate\nthe district court\u2019s judgment and remand this case to the\ndistrict court with instructions to enter APHIS\u2019s proposed\nrelief\u201d); Opening Brief of Federal Defendants-Appellants\nin No. 16458 etc. (CA9), pp. 21, 46 (\u201cThe blanket injunc\u00ad\ntion should be narrowed in accordance with APHIS\u2019s\nproposal\u201d); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 25\u201327, 53\u201354. That\njudgment would have replaced the vacated deregulation\ndecision with an order expressly allowing continued plant\u00ad\ning of RRA subject to certain limited conditions. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 184a (proposed judgment providing that\n\u201c[the federal] defendants\u2019 14 June 2005 Determination of\nNonregulated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered\nfor Tolerance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby va\u00ad\ncated and replaced by the terms of this judgment\u201d (empha\u00ad\nsis added)). Accordingly, if the District Court had adopted\nthe agency\u2019s suggested remedy, there would still be au\u00ad\nthority for the continued planting of RRA, because there\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwould, in effect, be a new deregulation decision.1\n   Second, petitioners in any case have standing to chal\u00ad\nlenge the part of the District Court\u2019s order enjoining par\u00ad\ntial deregulation. Respondents focus their standing ar\u00ad\ngument on the part of the judgment enjoining the planting\nof RRA, but the judgment also states that \u201c[b]efore grant\u00ad\ning Monsanto\u2019s deregulation petition, even in part, the\nfederal defendants shall prepare an environmental impact\nstatement.\u201d Id., at 108a (emphasis added); see also id., at\n79a (\u201cThe Court will enter a final judgment . . . ordering\nthe government to prepare an EIS before it makes a deci\u00ad\nsion on Monsanto\u2019s deregulation petition\u201d). As respon\u00ad\ndents concede, that part of the judgment goes beyond the\nvacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37, 46.\n   At oral argument, respondents contended that the re\u00ad\ntriction on APHIS\u2019s ability to effect a partial deregulation\nof RRA does not cause petitioners \u201can actual or an immi\u00ad\nnent harm.\u201d Id., at 39\u201340. In order for a partial deregula\u00ad\ntion to occur, respondents argued, the case would have to\nbe remanded to the agency, and APHIS would have to\nprepare an EA \u201cthat may or may not come out in favor of a\npartial deregulation.\u201d Id., at 39. Because petitioners\ncannot prove that those two events would happen, respon\u00ad\ndents contended, the asserted harm caused by the District\nCourt\u2019s partial deregulation ban is too speculative to\nsatisfy the actual or imminent injury requirement.\n   We reject this argument. If the injunction were lifted,\nwe do not see why the District Court would have to re\u00ad\nmand the matter to the agency in order for APHIS to\neffect a partial deregulation. And even if a remand were\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 We need not decide whether the District Court had the authority to\nreplace the vacated agency order with an injunction of its own making.\nThe question whether petitioners are entitled to the relief that they\nseek goes to the merits, not to standing.\n10        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired, we perceive no basis on which the District Court\ncould decline to remand the matter to the agency so that it\ncould determine whether to pursue a partial deregulation\nduring the pendency of the EIS process.\n   Nor is any doubt as to whether APHIS would issue a\nnew EA in favor of a partial deregulation sufficient to\ndefeat petitioners\u2019 standing. It is undisputed that peti\u00ad\ntioners have submitted a deregulation petition and that a\npartial deregulation of the kind embodied in the agency\u2019s\nproposed judgment would afford petitioners much of the\nrelief that they seek; it is also undisputed that, absent the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order, APHIS could attempt to effect such\na partial deregulation pending its completion of the EIS.\nSee id., at 7\u20138, 25\u201327, 38. For purposes of resolving the\nparticular standing question before us, we need not decide\nwhether or to what extent a party challenging an injunc\u00ad\ntion that bars an agency from granting certain relief must\nshow that the agency would be likely to afford such relief\nif it were free to do so. In this case, as is clear from\nAPHIS\u2019s proposed judgment and from its briefing\nthroughout the remedial phase of this litigation, the\nagency takes the view that a partial deregulation reflect\u00ad\ning its proposed limitations is in the public interest. Thus,\nthere is more than a strong likelihood that APHIS would\npartially deregulate RRA were it not for the District\nCourt\u2019s injunction. The District Court\u2019s elimination of\nthat likelihood is plainly sufficient to establish a constitu\u00ad\ntionally cognizable injury. Moreover, as respondents\nessentially conceded at oral argument, that injury would\nbe redressed by a favorable decision here, since \u201cvacating\nthe current injunction . . . will allow [petitioners] to go\nback to the agency, [to] seek a partial deregulation,\u201d even\nif the District Court\u2019s vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation\ndecision is left intact. Id., at 38. We therefore hold that\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners have standing to seek this Court\u2019s review.2\n                              B\n   We next consider petitioners\u2019 contention that respon\u00ad\ndents lack standing to seek injunctive relief. See Daim\nlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (\u201c[A]\nplaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each\nform of relief sought\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nPetitioners argue that respondents have failed to show\nthat any of the named respondents is likely to suffer a\nconstitutionally cognizable injury absent injunctive relief.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 40. We disagree.\n   Respondents include conventional alfalfa farmers.\nEmphasizing \u201cthe undisputed concentration of alfalfa seed\nfarms,\u201d the District Court found that those farmers had\n\u201cestablished a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that their organic\nand conventional alfalfa crops will be infected with the\nengineered gene\u201d if RRA is completely deregulated. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 50a.3 A substantial risk of gene flow\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 We do not rest \u201cthe primary basis for our jurisdiction on the premise\n\nthat the District Court enjoined APHIS from partially deregulating\nRRA in any sense.\u201d See post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Even if the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order prohibiting a partial deregulation applies only to\n\u201cthe particular partial deregulation order proposed to the court by\nAPHIS,\u201d see post, at 8, petitioners would still have standing to chal\u00ad\nlenge that aspect of the order.\n   3At least one of the respondents in this case specifically alleges that\n\nhe owns an alfalfa farm in a prominent seed-growing region and faces a\nsignificant risk of contamination from RRA. See Record, Doc. 62, pp. 1\u2013\n2; id., \u00b610, at 3\u20134 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of Plan\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment) (\u201cSince alfalfa is pollinated by\nhoney, bumble and leafcutter bees, the genetic contamination of the\nRoundup Ready seed will rapidly spread through the seed growing\nregions. Bees have a range of at least two to ten miles, and the alfalfa\nseed farms are much more concentrated\u201d). Other declarations in the\nrecord provide further support for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that\nthe deregulation of RRA poses a significant risk of contamination to\nrespondents\u2019 crops. See, e.g., id., Doc. 53, \u00b69, at 2 (Declaration of Jim\nMunsch) (alleging risk of \u201csignificant contamination . . . due to the\n12         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjures respondents in several ways. For example, re\u00ad\nspondents represent that, in order to continue marketing\ntheir product to consumers who wish to buy non\u00ad\ngenetically-engineered alfalfa, respondents would have to\nconduct testing to find out whether and to what extent\ntheir crops have been contaminated. See, e.g., Record,\nDoc. 62, p. 5 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of\nPlantiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment) (hereinafter\nGeertson Declaration) (\u201cDue to the high potential for\ncontamination, I will need to test my crops for the pres\u00ad\nence of genetically engineered alfalfa seed. This testing\nwill be a new cost to my seed business and we will have to\nraise our seed prices to cover these costs, making our\nprices less competitive\u201d); id., Doc. 57, p. 4 (Declaration of\nPatrick Trask in Support of Plantiff\u2019s Motion for Summary\nJudgment) (\u201cTo ensure that my seeds are pure, I will need\nto test my crops and obtain certification that my seeds are\nfree of genetically engineered alfalfa\u201d); see also Record,\nDoc. 55, p. 2 (\u201cThere is zero tolerance for contaminated\nseed in the organic market\u201d). Respondents also allege that\nthe risk of gene flow will cause them to take certain meas\u00ad\nures to minimize the likelihood of potential contamination\nand to ensure an adequate supply of non-genetically\u00ad\nengineered alfalfa. See, e.g., Geertson Declaration 3 (not\u00ad\ning the \u201cincreased cost of alfalfa breeding due to potential\nfor genetic contamination\u201d); id., at 6 (\u201cDue to the threat of\ncontamination, I have begun contracting with growers\noutside of the United States to ensure that I can supply\ngenetically pure, conventional alfalfa seed. Finding new\ngrowers has already resulted in increased administrative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncompact geographic area of the prime alfalfa seed producing areas and\nthe fact that pollen is distributed by bees that have large natural range\nof activity\u201d); App. \u00b68, p. 401 (Declaration of Marc Asumendi) (\u201cRoundup\nalfalfa seed fields are currently being planted in all the major alfalfa\nseed production areas with little regard to contamination to non-GMO\nseed production fields\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncosts at my seed business\u201d).\n   Such harms, which respondents will suffer even if their\ncrops are not actually infected with the Roundup ready\ngene, are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact\nprong of the constitutional standing analysis. Those\nharms are readily attributable to APHIS\u2019s deregulation\ndecision, which, as the District Court found, gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered\nvarieties of alfalfa. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting\nthe growth and sale of all or some genetically engineered\nalfalfa would remedy respondents\u2019 injuries by eliminating\nor minimizing the risk of gene flow to conventional and\norganic alfalfa crops. We therefore conclude that respon\u00ad\ndents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive relief\nfrom the complete deregulation order at issue here.\n   Petitioners appear to suggest that respondents fail to\nsatisfy the \u201czone of interests\u201d test we have previously\narticulated as a prudential standing requirement in cases\nchallenging agency compliance with particular statutes.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioners 12 (arguing that protection\nagainst the risk of commercial harm \u201cis not an interest\nthat NEPA was enacted to address\u201d); Bennett v. Spear, 520\nU. S. 154, 162\u2013163 (1997). That argument is unpersua\u00ad\nsive because, as the District Court found, respondents\u2019\ninjury has an environmental as well as an economic com\u00ad\nponent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. In its ruling on the\nmerits of respondents\u2019 NEPA claim, the District Court\nheld that the risk that the RRA gene conferring gly\u00ad\nphosate resistance will infect conventional and organic\nalfalfa is a significant environmental effect within the\nmeaning of NEPA. Petitioners did not appeal that part of\nthe court\u2019s ruling, and we have no occasion to revisit it\nhere. Respondents now seek injunctive relief in order to\navert the risk of gene flow to their crops\u2014the very same\neffect that the District Court determined to be a signifi\u00ad\ncant environmental concern for purposes of NEPA. The\n14        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmere fact that respondents also seek to avoid certain\neconomic harms that are tied to the risk of gene flow does\nnot strip them of prudential standing.\n  In short, respondents have standing to seek injunctive\nrelief, and petitioners have standing to seek this Court\u2019s\nreview of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment affirming the entry\nof such relief. We therefore proceed to the merits of the\ncase.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   The District Court sought to remedy APHIS\u2019s NEPA\nviolation in three ways: First, it vacated the agency\u2019s\ndecision completely deregulating RRA; second, it enjoined\nAPHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pend\u00ad\ning completion of the mandated EIS; and third, it entered\na nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all future\nplanting of RRA. Id., at 108a\u2013110a. Because petitioners\nand the Government do not argue otherwise, we assume\nwithout deciding that the District Court acted lawfully in\nvacating the deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\n(\u201c[T]he district court could have vacated the order in its\nentirety and sent it back to the agency\u201d); accord, id., at 15\u2013\n16. We therefore address only the latter two aspects of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment. Before doing so, however, we\nprovide a brief overview of the standard governing the\nentry of injunctive relief.\n                              B\n  \u201c[A] plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must\nsatisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such\nrelief. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suf\u00ad\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at\nlaw, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to com\u00ad\npensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of\nhardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest\nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\u201d eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391 (2006).\nThe traditional four-factor test applies when a plaintiff\nseeks a permanent injunction to remedy a NEPA violation.\nSee Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 21\u201323).\n   Petitioners argue that the lower courts in this case\nproceeded on the erroneous assumption that an injunction\nis generally the appropriate remedy for a NEPA violation.\nIn particular, petitioners note that the District Court cited\npre-Winter Ninth Circuit precedent for the proposition\nthat, in \u201c \u2018the run of the mill NEPA case,\u2019 \u201d an injunction\ndelaying the contemplated government project is proper\n\u201c \u2018until the NEPA violation is cured.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a (quoting Idaho Watersheds Project v. Hahn, 307\nF. 3d 815, 833 (CA9 2002)); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (quoting same language in preliminary injunction\norder). In addition, petitioners observe, the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals in this case both stated that, \u201cin\nunusual circumstances, an injunction may be withheld, or,\nmore likely, limited in scope\u201d in NEPA cases. Id., at 66a\n(quoting National Parks & Conservation Assn. v. Babbitt,\n241 F. 3d 722, 737, n. 18 (CA9 2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); 570 F. 3d, at 1137.\n   Insofar as the statements quoted above are intended to\nguide the determination whether to grant injunctive relief,\nthey invert the proper mode of analysis. An injunction\nshould issue only if the traditional four-factor test is satis\u00ad\nfied. See Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21\u201324). In\ncontrast, the statements quoted above appear to presume\nthat an injunction is the proper remedy for a NEPA viola\u00ad\ntion except in unusual circumstances. No such thumb on\nthe scales is warranted. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of\nthe Court of Appeals, could any such error be cured by a\ncourt\u2019s perfunctory recognition that \u201can injunction does\n16          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot automatically issue\u201d in NEPA cases. See 570 F. 3d, at\n1137 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not enough\nfor a court considering a request for injunctive relief to ask\nwhether there is a good reason why an injunction should\nnot issue; rather, a court must determine that an injunc\u00ad\ntion should issue under the traditional four-factor test set\nout above.\n   Notwithstanding the lower courts\u2019 apparent reliance on\nthe incorrect standard set out in the pre-Winter Circuit\nprecedents quoted above, respondents argue that the\nlower courts in fact applied the traditional four-factor test.\nIn their view, the statements that injunctive relief is\nproper in the \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d NEPA case, and that such\ninjunctions are granted except in \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d\nare descriptive rather than prescriptive. See Brief for\nRespondents 28, n. 14. We need not decide whether re\u00ad\nspondents\u2019 characterization of the lower court opinions in\nthis case is sound. Even if it is, the injunctive relief\ngranted here cannot stand.\n                            C\n  We first consider whether the District Court erred in\nenjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during\nthe pendency of the EIS process.4\n  The relevant part of the District Court\u2019s judgment states\nthat, \u201c[b]efore granting Monsanto\u2019s deregulation petition,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Petitionersfocus their challenge on the part of the District Court\u2019s\norder prohibiting the planting of RRA. As we explain below, however,\nthe broad injunction against planting cannot be valid if the injunction\nagainst partial deregulation is improper. See infra, at 23; see also App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 64a (District Court order recognizing that APHIS\u2019s\nproposed remedy \u201cseek[s], in effect, a partial deregulation that permits\nthe continued expansion of the Roundup Ready alfalfa market subject\nto certain conditions\u201d (emphasis added)). The validity of the injunction\nprohibiting partial deregulation is therefore properly before us. Like\nthe District Court, we use the term \u201cpartial deregulation\u201d to refer to\nany limited or conditional deregulation. See id., at 64a, 69a.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

The plain text of the order prohib\u00ad\nits any partial deregulation, not just the particular partial\nderegulation embodied in APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment.\nWe think it is quite clear that the District Court meant\njust what it said. The related injunction against planting\nstates that \u201cno [RRA] . . . may be planted\u201d \u201c[u]ntil the\nfederal defendants prepare the EIS and decide the deregu\u00ad\nlation petition.\u201d Id., at 108a (emphasis added). That\ninjunction, which appears in the very same judgment and\ndirectly follows the injunction against granting Mon\u00ad\nsanto\u2019s petition \u201ceven in part,\u201d does not carve out an ex\u00ad\nception for planting subsequently authorized by a valid\npartial deregulation decision.\n   In our view, none of the traditional four factors govern\u00ad\ning the entry of permanent injunctive relief supports the\nDistrict Court\u2019s injunction prohibiting partial deregula\u00ad\ntion. To see why that is so, it is helpful to understand how\nthe injunction prohibiting a partial deregulation fits into\nthe broader dispute between the parties.\n   Respondents in this case brought suit under the APA to\nchallenge a particular agency order: APHIS\u2019s decision to\ncompletely deregulate RRA. The District Court held that\nthe order in question was procedurally defective, and\nAPHIS decided not to appeal that determination. At that\npoint, it was for the agency to decide whether and to what\nextent it would pursue a partial deregulation. If the\nagency found, on the basis of a new EA, that a limited and\ntemporary deregulation satisfied applicable statutory and\nregulatory requirements, it could proceed with such a\nderegulation even if it had not yet finished the onerous\nEIS required for complete deregulation. If and when the\n18         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nagency were to issue a partial deregulation order, any\nparty aggrieved by that order could bring a separate suit\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the\nparticular deregulation attempted. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702.\n   In this case, APHIS apparently sought to \u201cstreamline\u201d\nthe proceedings by asking the District Court to craft a\nremedy that, in effect, would have partially deregulated\nRRA until such time as the agency had finalized the EIS\nneeded for a complete deregulation. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n16, 23\u201324; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. To justify that dispo\u00ad\nsition, APHIS and petitioners submitted voluminous\ndocumentary submissions in which they purported to show\nthat the risk of gene flow would be insignificant if the\nDistrict Court allowed limited planting and harvesting\nsubject to APHIS\u2019s proposed conditions. Respondents, in\nturn, submitted considerable evidence of their own that\nseemed to cut the other way. This put the District Court\nin an unenviable position. \u201cThe parties\u2019 experts disagreed\nover virtually every factual issue relating to possible\nenvironmental harm, including the likelihood of genetic\ncontamination and why some contamination had already\noccurred.\u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1135.\n   The District Court may well have acted within its dis\u00ad\ncretion in refusing to craft a judicial remedy that would\nhave authorized the continued planting and harvesting of\nRRA while the EIS is being prepared. It does not follow,\nhowever, that the District Court was within its rights in\nenjoining APHIS from allowing such planting and harvest\u00ad\ning pursuant to the authority vested in the agency by law.\nWhen the District Court entered its permanent injunction,\nAPHIS had not yet exercised its authority to partially\nderegulate RRA. Until APHIS actually seeks to effect a\npartial deregulation, any judicial review of such a decision\nis premature.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 NEPA   provides that an EIS must be \u201cinclude[d] in every recommen\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor can the District Court\u2019s injunction be justified as a\nprophylactic measure needed to guard against the possi\u00ad\nbility that the agency would seek to effect on its own the\nparticular partial deregulation scheme embodied in the\nterms of APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment. Even if the District\nCourt was not required to adopt that judgment, there was\nno need to stop the agency from effecting a partial deregu\u00ad\nlation in accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw. Moreover, the terms of the District Court\u2019s injunction\ndo not just enjoin the particular partial deregulation\nembodied in APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment. Instead, the\nDistrict Court barred the agency from pursuing any de\u00ad\nregulation\u2014no matter how limited the geographic area in\nwhich planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the\nisolation distances mandated between RRA fields and\nfields for growing non-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how\nstringent the regulations governing harvesting and distri\u00ad\nbution, how robust the enforcement mechanisms available\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal\nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d\n42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see also Kleppe v. Sierra\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 406 (1976) (\u201cA court has no authority to depart\nfrom the statutory language and . . . determine a point during the\ngermination process of a potential proposal at which an impact state\u00ad\nment should be prepared\u201d (first emphasis added)). When a particular\nagency proposal exists and requires the preparation of an EIS, NEPA\nregulations allow the agency to take at least some action pertaining to\nthat proposal during the pendency of the EIS process. See 40 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71506.1(a), (c) (2009). We do not express any view on the Govern\u00ad\nment\u2019s contention that a limited deregulation of the kind embodied in\nits proposed judgment would not require the prior preparation of an\nEIS. See Brief for Federal Respondents 21\u201322 (citing \u00a71506.1(a)); Tr. of\nOral Arg. 20 (\u201cwhat we were proposing for the interim, that is allowing\ncontinued planting subject to various protective measures, was funda\u00ad\nmentally different from the action on which the EIS was being pre\u00ad\npared\u201d). Because APHIS has not yet invoked the procedures necessary\nto attempt a limited deregulation, any judicial consideration of such\nissues is not warranted at this time.\n20        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat the time of the decision, and\u2014consequently\u2014no matter\nhow small the risk that the planting authorized under\nsuch conditions would adversely affect the environment in\ngeneral and respondents in particular.\n   The order enjoining any partial deregulation was also\ninconsistent with other aspects of the very same judgment.\nIn fashioning its remedy for the NEPA violation, the\nDistrict Court steered a \u201cmiddle course\u201d between more\nextreme options on either end. See id., at 1136. On the\none hand, the District Court rejected APHIS\u2019s proposal\n(supported by petitioners) to allow continued planting and\nharvesting of RRA subject to the agency\u2019s proposed limita\u00ad\ntions. On the other hand, the District Court did not bar\ncontinued planting of RRA as a regulated article under\npermit from APHIS, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a, and it\nexpressly allowed farmers to harvest and sell RRA planted\nbefore March 30, 2007, id., at 76a\u201379a. If the District\nCourt was right to conclude that any partial deregulation,\nno matter how limited, required the preparation of an EIS,\nit is hard to see why the limited planting and harvesting\nthat the District Court allowed did not also require the\npreparation of an EIS. Conversely, if the District Court\nwas right to conclude that the limited planting and har\u00ad\nvesting it allowed did not require the preparation of an\nEIS, then an appropriately limited partial deregulation\nshould likewise have been possible.\n   Based on the analysis set forth above, it is clear that the\norder enjoining any deregulation whatsoever does not\nsatisfy the traditional four-factor test for granting perma\u00ad\nnent injunctive relief. Most importantly, respondents\ncannot show that they will suffer irreparable injury if\nAPHIS is allowed to proceed with any partial deregula\u00ad\ntion, for at least two independent reasons.\n   First, if and when APHIS pursues a partial deregulation\nthat arguably runs afoul of NEPA, respondents may file a\nnew suit challenging such action and seeking appropriate\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreliminary relief. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7702, 705. Accordingly,\na permanent injunction is not now needed to guard\nagainst any present or imminent risk of likely irreparable\nharm.\n   Second, a partial deregulation need not cause respon\u00ad\ndents any injury at all, much less irreparable injury; if the\nscope of the partial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the\nrisk of gene flow to their crops could be virtually nonexis\u00ad\ntent. For example, suppose that APHIS deregulates RRA\nonly in a remote part of the country in which respondents\nneither grow nor intend to grow non-genetically\u00ad\nengineered alfalfa, and in which no conventional alfalfa\nfarms are currently located. Suppose further that APHIS\nissues an accompanying administrative order mandating\nisolation distances so great as to eliminate any apprecia\u00ad\nble risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional farmers\nwho might someday choose to plant in the surrounding\narea. See, e.g., Brief in Opposition 9, n. 6 (quoting study\nconcluding \u201c \u2018that in order for there to be zero tolerance of\nany gene flow between a [RRA] seed field and a conven\u00ad\ntional seed field, those fields would have to have a five\u00ad\nmile isolation distance between them\u2019 \u201d); see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 15\u201316 (representation from the Solicitor General\nthat APHIS may impose conditions on the deregulation of\nRRA via issuance of an administrative order). Finally,\nsuppose that APHIS concludes in a new EA that its lim\u00ad\nited deregulation would not pose a significant risk of gene\nflow or harmful weed development, and that the agency\nadopts a plan to police vigorously compliance with its\nadministrative order in the limited geographic area in\nquestion. It is hard to see how respondents could show\nthat such a limited deregulation would cause them likely\nirreparable injury. (Respondents in this case do not repre\u00ad\nsent a class, so they could not seek to enjoin such an order\non the ground that it might cause harm to other parties.)\nIn any case, the District Court\u2019s order prohibiting any\n22          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npartial deregulation improperly relieves respondents of\ntheir burden to make the requisite evidentiary showing.6\n   Of course, APHIS might ultimately choose not to par\u00ad\ntially deregulate RRA during the pendency of the EIS, or\nelse to pursue the kind of partial deregulation embodied in\nits proposed judgment rather than the very limited de\u00ad\nregulation envisioned in the above hypothetical. Until\nsuch time as the agency decides whether and how to exer\u00ad\ncise its regulatory authority, however, the courts have no\ncause to intervene. Indeed, the broad injunction entered\nhere essentially pre-empts the very procedure by which\nthe agency could determine, independently of the pending\nEIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregu\u00ad\nlation, that a limited deregulation would not pose any\nappreciable risk of environmental harm. See 40 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71501.4, 1508.9(a) (2009).\n   In sum, we do not know whether and to what extent\nAPHIS would seek to effect a limited deregulation during\nthe pendency of the EIS process if it were free to do so; we\ndo know that the vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision\nmeans that virtually no RRA can be grown or sold until\nsuch time as a new deregulation decision is in place, and\nwe also know that any party aggrieved by a hypothetical\nfuture deregulation decision will have ample opportunity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The District Court itself appears to have recognized that its broad\n\ninjunction may not have been necessary to avert any injury to respon\u00ad\ndents. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a (\u201cIt does complicate it to try to\nfine-tune a particular remedy. So the simpler the remedy, the more\nattractive it is from the Court\u2019s point of view, because it appears to me\nenforcement is easier.

In light of these\nparticular circumstances, we hold that the District Court\ndid not properly exercise its discretion in enjoining a\npartial deregulation of any kind pending APHIS\u2019s prepa\u00ad\nration of an EIS. It follows that the Court of Appeals\nerred in affirming that aspect of the District Court\u2019s\njudgment.\n                             D\n   We now turn to petitioners\u2019 claim that the District Court\nerred in entering a nationwide injunction against planting\nRRA. Petitioners argue that the District Court did not\napply the right test for determining whether to enter\npermanent injunctive relief; that, even if the District\nCourt identified the operative legal standard, it erred as a\nmatter of law in applying that standard to the facts of this\ncase; and that the District Court was required to grant\npetitioners an evidentiary hearing to resolve contested\nissues of fact germane to the remedial dispute between the\nparties. We agree that the District Court\u2019s injunction\nagainst planting went too far, but we come to that conclu\u00ad\nsion for two independent reasons.\n   First, the impropriety of the District Court\u2019s broad\ninjunction against planting flows from the impropriety of\nits injunction against partial deregulation. If APHIS may\npartially deregulate RRA before preparing a full-blown\nEIS\u2014a question that we need not and do not decide here\u2014\nfarmers should be able to grow and sell RRA in accordance\nwith that agency determination. Because it was inappro\u00ad\npriate for the District Court to foreclose even the possibil\u00ad\nity of a partial and temporary deregulation, it necessarily\nfollows that it was likewise inappropriate to enjoin any\nand all parties from acting in accordance with the terms of\nsuch a deregulation decision.\n   Second, respondents have represented to this Court that\n24       MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court\u2019s injunction against planting does not\nhave any meaningful practical effect independent of its\nvacatur. See Brief for Respondents 24; see also Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37 (\u201c[T]he mistake that was made [by the District\nCourt] was in not appreciating . . . that the vacatur did\nhave [the] effect\u201d of independently prohibiting the growth\nand sale of almost all RRA). An injunction is a drastic and\nextraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a\nmatter of course. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,\n456 U. S. 305, 311\u2013312 (1982). If a less drastic remedy\n(such as partial or complete vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregula\u00ad\ntion decision) was sufficient to redress respondents\u2019 injury,\nno recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an\ninjunction was warranted. See ibid.; see also Winter, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21\u201323).\n                             E\n   In sum, the District Court abused its discretion in en\u00ad\njoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in\nprohibiting the possibility of planting in accordance with\nthe terms of such a deregulation. Given those errors, this\nCourt need not express any view on whether injunctive\nrelief of some kind was available to respondents on the\nrecord before us. Nor does the Court address the question\nwhether the District Court was required to conduct an\nevidentiary hearing before entering the relief at issue\nhere. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a,\n54a, 62a. Second, even planting in a controlled setting\nhad led to contamination in some instances. See id., at\n69a\u201370a. Third, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService (APHIS) has limited ability to monitor or enforce\nlimitations on planting. See id., at 70a. And fourth,\ngenetic contamination from RRA could decimate farmers\u2019\nlivelihoods and the American alfalfa market for years to\ncome. See id., at 71a; see also id., at 29a\u201330a. Instead,\nthe majority faults the District Court for \u201cenjoining\nAPHIS from partially deregulating RRA.\u201d Ante, at 16.\n   In my view, the District Court may not have actually\nordered such relief, and we should not so readily assume\nthat it did. Regardless, the District Court did not abuse\nits discretion when, after considering the voluminous\nrecord and making the aforementioned findings, it issued\nthe order now before us.\n                           I\n  To understand the District Court\u2019s judgment, it is nec\nessary to understand the background of this litigation.\nPetitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto) is a large cor\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nporation that has long produced a weed killer called\nRoundup. After years of experimentation, Monsanto and\nco-petitioner Forage Genetics International (FGI) geneti\ncally engineered a mutation in the alfalfa genome that\nmakes the plant immune to Roundup. Monsanto and\nFGI\u2019s new product, RRA, is \u201cthe first crop that has been\nengineered to resist a[n] herbicide\u201d and that can transmit\nthe genetically engineered gene to other plants. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 45a.\n   In 2004, in the midst of a deregulatory trend in the\nagricultural sector, petitioners asked APHIS to deregulate\nRRA, thereby allowing it to be sold and planted nation\nwide. App. 101a. Rather than conducting a detailed\nanalysis and preparing an \u201cenvironmental impact state\nment\u201d (EIS), as required by the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for every \u201cmajor Federal ac\ntio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human\nenvironment,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C), APHIS merely\nconducted an abbreviated \u201cenvironmental assessment\u201d\n(EA). During the 6-month period in which APHIS allowed\npublic comment on its EA, the agency received 663 com\nments, 520 of which opposed deregulation. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 29a. Farmers and scientists opined that RRA could\ncontaminate alfalfa that has not been genetically modified,\ndestroying the American export market for alfalfa and,\npotentially, contaminating other plants and breeding a\nnew type of pesticide-resistant weed. Id., at 29a\u201330a.\n   Despite substantial evidence that RRA genes could\ntransfer to other plants, APHIS issued a Finding of No\nSignificant Impact and agreed to deregulate RRA \u201cuncon\nditionally,\u201d ante, at 4. With no EIS to wait for and no\nregulation blocking its path, petitioners began selling\nRRA. Farmers and environmental groups swiftly brought\nthis lawsuit to challenge APHIS\u2019s decision to deregulate,\nraising claims under NEPA and other statutes.\n   The District Court carefully reviewed a long record and\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfound that \u201cAPHIS\u2019s reasons for concluding\u201d that the risks\nof genetic contamination are low were \u201cnot \u2018convincing.\u2019 \u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 38a. A review of APHIS\u2019s internal\ndocuments showed that individuals within the agency\nwarned that contamination might occur. APHIS rested its\ndecision to deregulate on its assertion that contamination\nrisk is \u201cnot significant because it is the organic and con\nventional farmers\u2019 responsibility\u201d to protect themselves\nand the environment. Ibid. Yet the agency drew this\nconclusion without having investigated whether such\nfarmers \u201ccan, in fact, protect their crops from contamina\ntion.\u201d Ibid. The District Court likewise found that\nAPHIS\u2019s reasons for disregarding the risk of pesticide\nresistant weeds were speculative and \u201cnot convincing.\u201d\nId., at 46a. The agency had merely explained that if\nweeds acquire roundup resistance, farmers can use \u201c \u2018[a]l\nternative herbicides.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. In light of the \u201cacknowl\nedged\u201d risk of RRA gene transmission and the potential\n\u201cimpact on the development of Roundup resistant weeds,\u201d\nthe court concluded that there was a significant possibility\nof serious environmental harm, and granted summary\njudgment for the plaintiffs. Id., at 54a; see also id., at 45a.\n   At this point, the question of remedy arose. The parties\nsubmitted proposed final judgments, and several corpora\ntions with an interest in RRA, including Monsanto, sought\npermission to intervene. The District Court granted their\nmotion and agreed \u201cto give them the opportunity to pre\nsent evidence to assist the court in fashioning the appro\npriate scope of whatever relief is granted.\u201d Id., at 54a\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   While the District Court considered the proposed judg\nments, it issued a preliminary injunction. Ordinarily, the\ncourt explained, the remedy for failure to conduct an EIS\nis to vacate the permit that was unlawfully given\u2014the\nresult of which, in this case, would be to prohibit any use\nof RRA. See id., at 55a; see also id., at 65a. But this case\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                   STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npresented a special difficulty: Following APHIS\u2019s unlawful\nderegulation order, some farmers had begun planting\ngenetically modified RRA. Id., at 55a. In its preliminary\ninjunction, the District Court ordered that no new RRA\ncould be planted until APHIS completed the EIS or the\ncourt determined that some other relief was appropriate.\nBut, so as to protect these farmers, the court declined to\nprohibit them from \u201charvesting, using, or selling\u201d any\ncrops they had already planted. Id., at 56a. And \u201cto\nminimize the harm to those growers who intend to immi\nnently plant Roundup Ready alfalfa,\u201d the court permitted\n\u201c[t]hose growers who intend to plant [RRA] in the next\nthree weeks and have already purchased the seed\u201d to go\nahead and plant. Id., at 58a (emphasis deleted). Essen\ntially, the court grandfathered in those farmers who had\nrelied, in good faith, on APHIS\u2019s actions.\n   Before determining the scope of its final judgment, the\nDistrict Court invited the parties and intervenors to sub\nmit \u201cwhatever additional evidence\u201d they \u201cwish[ed] to\nprovide,\u201d and it scheduled additional oral argument. Id.,\nat 58a\u201359a. The parties submitted \u201ccompeting proposals\nfor permanent injunctive relief.\u201d Id., at 60a. The plain\ntiffs requested that no one\u2014not even the grandfathered-in\nfarmers\u2014be allowed to plant, grow, or harvest RRA until\nthe full EIS had been prepared. Id., at 64a. APHIS and\nthe intervenors instead sought a remedy that would \u201cfa\ncilitat[e] the continued and dramatic growth\u201d of RRA: a\n\u201cpartial deregulation\u201d order that would permit planting\nsubject to certain conditions, such as specified minimum\ndistances between RRA and conventional alfalfa and\nspecial cleaning requirements for equipment used on the\ngenetically modified crop. See id., at 60a\u201364a.\n   The court adopted a compromise. First, it declined to\nadopt the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. APHIS itself had\nacknowledged that \u201cgene transmission could and had\noccurred,\u201d and that RRA \u201ccould result in the development\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof Roundup-resistant weeds.\u201d Id., at 61a\u201362a. In light of\nthe substantial record evidence of these risks, the court\nwould not agree to a nationwide planting scheme \u201cwithout\nthe benefit of the development of all the relevant data,\u201d as\nwell as public comment about whether contamination\ncould be controlled. Id., at 68a. The \u201cpartial deregulation\u201d\nproposed by petitioners, the court noted, was really \u201cde\nregulation with certain conditions,\u201d id., at 69a\u2014which, for\nthe same reasons given in the court\u2019s earlier order, re\nquires an EIS, ibid. The court pointed out numerous\nproblems with the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. Neither\nAPHIS nor Monsanto had provided \u201cevidence that sug\ngests whether, and to what extent, the proposed interim\nconditions\u201d would actually \u201cbe followed,\u201d and comparable\nconditions had failed to prevent contamination in certain\nlimited settings. Id., at 69a\u201370a. APHIS, moreover,\nconceded that \u201cit does not have the resources to inspect\u201d\nthe RRA that had already been planted, and so could not\npossibly be expected \u201cto adequately monitor the more than\none million acres of [RRA] intervenors estimate [would] be\nplanted\u201d under their proposal. Ibid. That was especially\nproblematic because any plan to limit contamination\ndepended on rules about harvesting, and farmers were\nunlikely to follow those rules. Id., at 71a. \u201cAPHIS ha[d]\nstill not made any inquiry\u201d into numerous factual concerns\nraised by the court in its summary judgment order issued\nseveral months earlier. Id., at 70a.\n  Next, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed remedy\nof \u201cenjoin[ing] the harvesting and sale of already planted\u201d\nRRA. Id., at 76a. Although any planting or harvesting of\nRRA poses a contamination risk, the court reasoned that\nthe equities were different for those farmers who had\nalready invested time and money planting RRA in good\nfaith reliance on APHIS\u2019s deregulation order. And small\namounts of harvesting could be more easily monitored.\nRather than force the farmers to tear up their crops, the\n6        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncourt imposed a variety of conditions on the crops\u2019 han\ndling and distribution. Id., at 77a.\n   As to all other RRA, however, the court sided with the\nplaintiffs and enjoined planting during the pendency of\nthe EIS. Balancing the equities, the court explained that\nthe risk of harm was great. \u201c[C]ontamination cannot be\nundone; it will destroy the crops of those farmers who do\nnot sell genetically modified alfalfa.\u201d Id., at 71a. And\nbecause those crops \u201ccannot be replanted for two to four\nyears,\u201d that loss will be even greater. Ibid. On the other\nside of the balance, the court recognized that some farmers\nmay wish to switch to genetically modified alfalfa immedi\nately, and some companies like Monsanto want to start\nselling it to them just as fast. But, the court noted, RRA is\na small percentage of those companies\u2019 overall business;\nunsold seed can be stored; and the companies \u201c \u2018have [no]\ncause to claim surprise\u2019 \u201d as to any loss of anticipated\nrevenue, as they \u201cwere aware of plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit\u201d and\n\u201cnonetheless chose to market\u201d RRA. Id., at 72a.\n   Thus, the District Court stated that it would \u201cvacat[e]\nthe June 2005 deregulation decision\u201d; \u201cenjoi[n] the plant\ning of [RRA] in the United States after March 30, 2007,\u201d\nthe date of the decision, \u201cpending the government\u2019s com\npletion of the EIS and decision on the deregulation peti\ntion\u201d; and impose \u201cconditions on the handling and identifi\ncation of already-planted [RRA].\u201d Id., at 79a.

The Court today rests\nnot only the bulk of its analysis but also the primary basis\nfor our jurisdiction on the premise that the District Court\nenjoined APHIS from partially deregulating RRA in any\nsense. See ante, at 9\u201311, 16\u201323.1 That is a permissible,\nbut not necessarily correct, reading of the District Court\u2019s\njudgment.\n  So far as I can tell, until petitioners\u2019 reply brief, neither\npetitioners nor the Government submitted to us that the\nDistrict Court had exceeded its authority in this manner.\nAnd, indeed, the Government had not raised this issue in\nany court at all. Petitioners did not raise the issue in any\nof their three questions presented or in the body of their\npetition for a writ or certiorari. And they did not raise the\nissue in their opening briefs to this Court. Only after\nrespondents alleged that Monsanto\u2019s injury would not be\nredressed by vacating the injunction, insofar as RRA\nwould still be a regulated article, did petitioners bring the\nissue to the Court\u2019s attention. Explaining why they have a\nredressable injury, petitioners alleged that the District\nCourt\u2019s order prevents APHIS from \u201cimplement[ing] an[y]\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See also ante, at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he District Court barred the agency\n\nfrom pursuing any deregulation\u2014no matter how limited the geographic\narea in which planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the isola\ntion distances mandated between RRA fields and fields for growing\nnon-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how stringent the regulations\ngoverning harvesting and distribution, how robust the enforcement\nmechanisms available at the time of the decision, and\u2014consequently\u2014\nno matter how small the risk that the planting authorized under such\nconditions would adversely affect the environment in general and\nrespondents in particular\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n8         MONSANTO CO. v.

APHIS, the party that the Court says\nwas wrongly \u201cbarred . . . from pursuing any deregulation,\u201d\neven \u201cin accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw,\u201d ante, at 19, did not complain about this aspect of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order even in its reply brief.\n  Thus, notwithstanding that petitioners \u201cadequately\npreserved their objection that the vacated deregulation\ndecision should have been replaced by APHIS\u2019s proposed\ninjunction,\u201d ante, at 8 (emphasis added), the key legal\npremise on which the Court decides this case was never\nadequately presented. Of course, this is not standard\u2014or\nsound\u2014judicial practice. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmi\nchael, 526 U. S. 137, 159 (1999) (STEVENS, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Today\u2019s decision illus\ntrates why, for it is quite unclear whether the Court\u2019s\npremise is correct, and the Court has put itself in the\nposition of deciding legal issues without the aid of briefing.\n  In my view, the District Court\u2019s judgment can fairly be\nread to address only (1) total deregulation orders of the\nkind that spawned this lawsuit, and (2) the particular\npartial deregulation order proposed to the court by APHIS.\nThis interpretation of the judgment is more consistent\nwith the District Court\u2019s accompanying opinion, which\nconcluded by stating that the court \u201cwill enter a final\njudgment\u201d \u201cordering the government to prepare an EIS\nbefore [the court] makes a decision on Monsanto\u2019s deregu\nlation petition.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a. The language\nof that opinion does not appear to \u201cba[r] the agency from\npursuing any deregulation\u2014no matter how limited,\u201d ante,\nat 19 (emphasis deleted). This interpretation is also more\nconsistent with APHIS\u2019s own decision not to contest what,\naccording to the Court, was an unprecedented infringe\nment on the agency\u2019s statutory authority.\n  To be sure, the District Court\u2019s judgment is somewhat\nopaque. But it is troubling that we may be asserting\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

It is also trou\nbling that we may be making law without adequate brief\ning on the critical questions we are passing upon. I would\nnot be surprised if on remand the District Court merely\nclarified its order.\n                              III\n   Even assuming that the majority has correctly inter\npreted the District Court\u2019s judgment, I do not agree that\nwe should reverse the District Court.\n   At the outset, it is important to observe that when a\ndistrict court is faced with an unlawful agency action, a\nset of parties who have relied on that action, and a prayer\nfor relief to avoid irreparable harm, the court is operating\nunder its powers of equity. In such a case, a court\u2019s func\ntion is \u201cto do equity and to mould each decree to the neces\nsities of the particular case.\u201d Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321\nU. S. 321, 329 (1944). \u201cFlexibility\u201d and \u201cpracticality\u201d are\nthe touchtones of these remedial determinations, as \u201cthe\npublic interest,\u201d \u201cprivate needs,\u201d and \u201ccompeting private\nclaims\u201d must all be weighed and reconciled against the\nbackground of the court\u2019s own limitations and its particu\nlar familiarity with the case.

S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C).\nRecall that the District Court had found, on the basis of\nsubstantial evidence, that planting RRA can cause genetic\ncontamination of other crops, planting in controlled set\ntings had led to contamination, APHIS is unable to moni\ntor or enforce limitations on planting, and genetic con\ntamination could decimate the American alfalfa market.\nIn light of that evidence, the court may well have con\ncluded that any deregulation of RRA, even in a \u201climited\n. . . geographic area\u201d with \u201cstringent . . . regulations gov\nerning harvesting and distribution,\u201d6 ante, at 19\u201320, re\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 See Reply Brief for Federal Respondents 3. There is an ongoing\n\ndebate about the role of equitable adjustments in administrative law.\nSee, e.g., Levin, Vacation at Sea: Judicial Remedies and Equitable\nDiscretion in Administrative Law, 53 Duke L. J. 291 (2003). The\nparties to this appeal and the majority assume that the District Court\u2019s\nremedy was crafted under its equity powers, and I will do the same.\n  6 One of the many matters not briefed in this case is how limited a\n\npartial deregulation can be. It is not clear whether the sort of ex\ntremely limited \u201cpartial deregulations\u201d envisioned by the Court, see\nante, at 19\u201323, in which RRA is \u201cderegulated\u201d in one small geographic\narea pursuant to stringent restrictions, could be achieved only through\n\u201cpartial deregulation\u201d actions, or whether they could also (or exclu\nsively) be achieved through a more case-specific permit process. Under\nthe applicable regulations, a regulated article may still be used subject\nto a permitting process. See 7 CFR \u00a7\u00a7340.0, 340.4 (2010). These\npermits \u201cprescribe confinement conditions and standard operating\nprocedures . . . to maintain confinement of the genetically engineered\norganism.\u201d Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Pro\nduced Through Genetic Engineering, 72 Fed.

As of\n2007, APHIS had never\u2014not once\u2014granted partial approval of a\n12         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nquires an EIS under NEPA. See generally D. Mandelker,\nNEPA Law and Litigation \u00a7\u00a78:33\u20138:48 (2d ed. 2009) (de\nscribing when an EIS is required); cf. Marsh v. Oregon\nNatural Resources Council, 490 U.

Indeed, it appears that any de\nregulation of a genetically modified, herbicide-resistant\ncrop that can transfer its genes to other organisms and\ncannot effectively be monitored easily fits the criteria for\nwhen an EIS is required.7 That is especially so when, as\nin this case, the environmental threat is novel.

Courts con\nfronted with NEPA violations regularly adopt interim\nmeasures to maintain the status quo, particularly if allow\ning agency action to go forward risks foreclosing alterna\ntive courses of action that the agency might have adopted\nfollowing completion of an EIS. See D. Mandelker, NEPA\nLaw and Litigation \u00a74:61. The applicable regulations, to\nwhich the District Court owed deference,9 provide that\nduring the preparation of an EIS, \u201cno action concerning\nthe [agency\u2019s] proposal shall be taken which would . . .\n[h]ave an adverse environmental impact\u201d or \u201c[l]imit the\nchoice of reasonable alternatives.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a71506.1(a)\n(2009). As exemplified by the problem of what to do with\nfarmers who had already purchased or planted RRA prior\nto the District Court\u2019s judgment, even minimal deregula\ntion can limit future regulatory options. \u201cCourts must\nremember that in many cases allowing an agency to pro\nceed makes a mockery of the EIS process, converting it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\naccompanying order \u201cmandating isolation distances so great as to\neliminate any appreciable risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional\nfarmers who might someday choose to plant in the surrounding area.\u201d\nAnte, at 21. At the outset, it is important to note the difference be\ntween a plausible hypothetical and a piece of fiction. At least as of\n2007, APHIS had never granted partial approval of a petition for\nnonregulated status. See n. 6, supra. And I doubt that it would choose\nto deregulate genetically modified alfalfa in a place where the growing\nconditions and sales networks for the product are so poor that no\nfarmer already plants it. Moreover, the notion that this imagined\nderegulation would pose virtually no environmental risk ignores one of\nthe District Court\u2019s critical findings of fact: APHIS has very limited\ncapacity to monitor its own restrictions. The agency could place all\nmanner of constraints on its deregulation orders; they will have no\neffect unless they are enforced.\n   9 See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 372\n\n(1989).\n14         MONSANTO CO. v.

Although it is \u201cfor the\nagency to decide whether and to what extent\u201d it will pur\nsue deregulation, ante, at 17, the court\u2019s application of\nNEPA to APHIS\u2019s regulation of RRA might have con\ntrolled any deregulation during the pendency of the EIS.\nPetitioners and APHIS had already come back to the court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The Court states that the order permitted both harvesting and\n\nplanting. But the court\u2019s final judgment permitted only sale and\nharvesting of RRA planted before March 30, 2007, more than a month\nbefore the judgment.

That same concern\nwould apply to any partial deregulation order. The court\ntherefore had good reason to make it clear, upfront, that\nthe parties should not continue to expend resources pro\nposing such orders, instead of just moving ahead with an\nEIS. Cf. Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312\nU. S. 496, 500 (1941) (\u201cThe resources of equity are equal to\nan adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative\ndecision\u201d). Indeed, it was APHIS itself that \u201csought to\n\u2018streamline\u2019 \u201d the process. Ante, at 18.\nInjunctive Relief\n   Second, the District Court\u2019s judgment can be understood\nas a reasonable response to the nature of the risks posed\nby RRA. Separate and apart from NEPA\u2019s requirement of\nan EIS, these risks were sufficiently serious, in my view,\nthat the court\u2019s injunction was a permissible exercise of its\nequitable authority.\n   The District Court found that gene transfer can and\ndoes occur, and that if it were to spread through open land\nthe environmental and economic consequences would be\ndevastating. Cf. Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480\nU. S. 531, 545 (1987) (\u201cEnvironmental injury, by its na\nture, can seldom be adequately remedied by money dam\nages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,\ni.e., irreparable\u201d).

S. __, __ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n   Additional considerations support the District Court\u2019s\njudgment. It was clear to the court that APHIS had only\nlimited capacity to monitor planted RRA, and some RRA\nhad already been planted. The marginal threat posed by\nadditional planting was therefore significant. Injunctive\nremedies are meant to achieve a \u201cnice adjustment and\nreconciliation between the competing claims\u201d of injury by\n\u201cmould[ing] each decree to the necessities of the case.\u201d\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under these circum\nstances, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude\nthat the most equitable solution was to allocate the lim\nited amount of potentially safe RRA to the farmers who\nhad already planted that crop.11\n   The Court suggests that the injunction was nonetheless\ntoo sweeping because \u201ca partial deregulation need not\ncause respondents any injury at all . . . if the scope of the\npartial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the risk of gene\nflow to their crops could be virtually nonexistent.\u201d Ante, at\n21. The Court appears to reach this conclusion by citing\none particular study (in a voluminous record), rather than\nany findings of fact.12 Even assuming that this study is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 As explained previously, I do not see the court\u2019s broad injunction as\n\n\u201cinconsistent,\u201d ante, at 20, with its decision that farmers who had\nalready planted RRA could harvest their crop. The equities are differ\nent for farmers who relied on the agency than for companies like\nMonstanto that developed an organism knowing it might be regulated;\nand APHIS could monitor only a limited amount of RRA.\n  12 The Court also hypothesizes a set of growing conditions that would\n\nisolate RRA from the plaintiffs in this case, even if not from other\nfarmers. See ante, at 21\u201322. As already explained, these hypotheticals\nare rather unrealistic. See n. 8, supra. And, given that the plaintiffs\ninclude environmental organizations as well as farmer and consumer\nassociations, it is hard to see how APHIS could so carefully isolate and\nprotect their interests. In any event, because APHIS concedes that it\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   17\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncorrect, the Court ignores the District Court\u2019s findings\nthat gene flow is likely and that APHIS has little ability to\nmonitor any conditions imposed on a partial deregulation.\nLimits on planting or harvesting may operate fine in a\nlaboratory setting, but the District Court concluded that\nmany limits will not be followed and cannot be enforced in\nthe real world.13\n  Against that background, it was perfectly reasonable to\nwait for an EIS. APHIS and petitioners argued to the\nDistrict Court that partial deregulation could be safely\nimplemented, they submitted evidence intended to show\nthat planting restrictions would prevent the spread of the\nnewly engineered gene, and they contested \u201cvirtually\nevery factual issue relating to possible environmental\nharm.\u201d Geertson Seed Farms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130,\n1135 (CA9 2009). But lacking \u201cthe benefit of the develop\nment of all the relevant data,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a,\nthe District Court did not find APHIS\u2019s and petitioners\u2019\nassertions to be convincing. I cannot say that I would\nhave found otherwise. It was reasonable for the court to\nconclude that planting could not go forward until more\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncannot monitor such limits, rules that protect these or any other parties\nmay be merely hortatory in practice. Moreover, although we have not\nsquarely addressed the issue, in my view \u201c[t]here is no general re\nquirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit.\u201d\nBresgal v. Brock, 843 F. 2d 1163, 1169 (CA9 1987). To limit an injunc\ntion against a federal agency to the named plaintiffs \u201cwould only\nencourage numerous other\u201d regulated entities \u201cto file additional law\nsuits in this and other federal jurisdictions.\u201d Livestock Marketing Assn.\nv.

See ante, at 22, n. 6. Quite right. As the District\nCourt said to APHIS\u2019s lawyer at that hearing, if the agency issues an\nelaborate set of precautions, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you even start to enforce\nit.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 190a\u2013191a.\n18         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncomplete study, presented in an EIS, showed that\nthe known problem of gene flow could, in reality, be\nprevented.14\n   The District Court\u2019s decision that more study was\nneeded to assess whether limits on deregulation could\nprevent environmental damage is further reinforced by\nthe statutory context in which the issue arose. A court\u2019s\nequitable discretion must be guided by \u201crecognized, de\nfined public policy.\u201d Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320 U. S.\n228, 235 (1943); see also Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S.\n321, 331 (1944) (explaining that when a court evaluates an\nagency\u2019s decision against the background of a federal\nstatute, the court\u2019s discretion \u201cmust be exercised in light of\nthe large objectives of the Act\u201d). Congress recognized in\nNEPA that complex environmental cases often require\nexceptionally sophisticated scientific determinations, and\nthat agency decisions should not be made on the basis of\n\u201cincomplete information.\u201d Marsh v. Oregon Natural Re\nsources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989). Congress also\nrecognized that agencies cannot fully weigh the conse\nquences of these decisions without obtaining public com\nments through an EIS. See Robertson v. Methow Valley\nCitizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 350 (1989).15 While a\ncourt may not presume that a NEPA violation requires an\ninjunction, it may take into account the principles embod\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 I suspect that if APHIS and petitioners had come back to the court\n\nwith more convincing evidence prior to completing an EIS, and moved\nto modify the court\u2019s order, the court would have done so. Indeed, the\nDistrict Court showed a willingness to recalibrate its order when it\namended its judgment just a few months after the judgment\u2019s issuance\nin light of APHIS\u2019s submission that certain requirements were imprac\ntical. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a\u2013114a.\n   15 Accordingly, while \u201cNEPA itself does not mandate particular re\n\nsults,\u201d it does mandate a particular process and embodies the principle\nthat federal agencies should \u201ccarefully conside[r] detailed information\u201d\nbefore incurring potential environmental harm.

This District Court had before it\nstrong evidence that gene transmission was likely to occur\nand that limits on growing could not be enforced. It also\nhad a large amount of highly detailed evidence about\nwhether growing restrictions, even if enforced, can prevent\ntransmission. That evidence called into question the\nagency\u2019s own claims regarding the risks posed by partial\nderegulation. In enjoining partial deregulation until it\nhad the benefit of an EIS to help parse the evidence, the\ncourt acted with exactly the sort of caution that Congress\nendorsed in NEPA.\n   Finally, it bears mention that the District Court\u2019s ex\nperience with the case may have given it grounds for\nskepticism about the representations made by APHIS and\npetitioners. Sometimes \u201cone judicial actor is better posi\ntioned than another to decide the issue in question.\u201d\nMiller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985). A \u201cdistrict\ncourt may have insights not conveyed by the record.\u201d\nPierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 560 (1988). In this\ncase, the agency had attempted to deregulate RRA without\nan EIS in spite of ample evidence of potential environ\nmental harms. And when the court made clear that the\nagency had violated NEPA, the agency responded by\nseeking to \u201c \u2018streamline\u2019 \u201d the process, ante, at 18, submit\nting a deregulation proposal with Monsanto that suffered\nfrom some of the same legal and empirical holes as its\ninitial plan to deregulate. Against that background, the\ncourt may have felt it especially prudent to wait for an EIS\nbefore concluding that APHIS could manage RRA\u2019s threat\nto the environment.\n                       *    *     *\n  The District Court in this case was put in an \u201cunenvi\nable position.\u201d Ibid.

Argued April 27, 2010\u2014Decided June 21, 2010\nThe Plant Protection Act (PPA) provides that the Secretary of the De\n  partment of Agriculture may issue regulations \u201cto prevent the intro\n  duction of plant pests into the United States or the dissemination of\n  plant pests within the United States.\u201d 7 U. S. C. \u00a77711(a). Pursuant\n  to that grant of authority, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\n  Service (APHIS) promulgated regulations that presume genetically\n  engineered plants to be \u201cplant pests\u201d\u2014and thus \u201cregulated articles\u201d\n  under the PPA\u2014until APHIS determines otherwise. However, any\n  person may petition APHIS for a determination that a regulated arti\n  cle does not present a plant pest risk and therefore should not be sub\n  ject to the applicable regulations. APHIS may grant such a petition\n  in whole or in part.\n     In determining whether to grant nonregulated status to a geneti\n  cally engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply with the Na\n  tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), which requires fed\n  eral agencies \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d to prepare a detailed\n  environmental impact statement (EIS) for \u201cevery . . . major Federal\n  actio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human environ\n  ment.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C). The agency need not complete an\n  EIS if it finds, based on a shorter statement known as an environ\n  mental assessment (EA), that the proposed action will not have a\n  significant environmental impact.\n     This case involves a challenge to APHIS\u2019s decision to approve the\n  unconditional deregulation of Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a vari\n  ety of alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to tolerate the her\n  bicide Roundup. Petitioners are the owner and the licensee of the in\n  tellectual property rights to RRA. In response to petitioners\u2019\n2            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    deregulation request, APHIS prepared a draft EA and solicited public\n    comments on its proposed course of action. Based on its EA and the\n    comments submitted, the agency determined that the introduction of\n    RRA would not have any significant adverse impact on the environ\n    ment. Accordingly, APHIS decided to deregulate RRA uncondition\n    ally and without preparing an EIS. Respondents, conventional al\n    falfa growers and environmental groups, filed this action challenging\n    that decision on the ground that it violated NEPA and other federal\n    laws. The District Court held, inter alia, that APHIS violated NEPA\n    when it deregulated RRA without first completing a detailed EIS. To\n    remedy that violation, the court vacated the agency\u2019s decision com\n    pletely deregulating RRA; enjoined APHIS from deregulating RRA,\n    in whole or in part, pending completion of the EIS; and entered a na\n    tionwide permanent injunction prohibiting almost all future planting\n    of RRA during the pendency of the EIS process. Petitioners and the\n    Government appealed, challenging the scope of the relief granted but\n    not disputing that APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision violated NEPA.\n    The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding, among other things, that the\n    District Court had not abused its discretion in rejecting APHIS\u2019s pro\n    posed mitigation measures in favor of a broader injunction.\nHeld:\n    1. Respondents have standing to seek injunctive relief, and peti\n tioners have standing to seek this Court\u2019s review of the Ninth Cir\n cuit\u2019s judgment affirming the entry of such relief. Pp. 7\u201314.\n       (a) Petitioners have constitutional standing to seek review here.\n Article III standing requires an injury that is (i) concrete, particular\n ized, and actual or imminent, (ii) fairly traceable to the challenged\n action, and (iii) redressable by a favorable ruling. See Horne v. Flo\n res, 557 U. S. ___, ___. Petitioners satisfy all three criteria. Petition\n ers are injured by their inability to sell or license RRA to prospective\n customers until APHIS completes the EIS. Because that injury is\n caused by the very remedial order that petitioners challenge on ap\n peal, it would be redressed by a favorable ruling from this Court. Re\n spondents nevertheless contend that petitioners lack standing be\n cause their complained-of injury is independently caused by a part of\n the District Court\u2019s order that petitioners failed to challenge, the va\n catur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision. That argument fails for two\n independent reasons. First, one of the main disputes between the\n parties throughout this litigation has been whether the District\n Court should have adopted APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment, which would\n have replaced the vacated deregulation decision with an order ex\n pressly authorizing the continued sale and planting of RRA. Accord\n ingly, if the District Court had adopted APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment,\n there would still be authority for the continued sale of RRA notwith\n                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nstanding the District Court\u2019s vacatur, because there would, in effect,\nbe a new deregulation decision. Second, petitioners in any case have\nstanding to challenge the part of the District Court\u2019s order enjoining\na partial deregulation. Respondents focus their argument on the part\nof the judgment that enjoins planting, but the judgment also states\nthat before granting the deregulation petition, even in part, the\nagency must prepare an EIS. That part of the judgment inflicts an\ninjury not also caused by the vacatur. Pp. 7\u201311.\n      (b) Respondents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive\nrelief from the complete deregulation order at issue here. The Court\ndisagrees with petitioners\u2019 argument that respondents have failed to\nshow that any of them is likely to suffer a constitutionally cognizable\ninjury absent injunctive relief. The District Court found that respon\ndent farmers had established a reasonable probability that their con\nventional alfalfa crops would be infected with the engineered\nRoundup Ready gene if RRA were completely deregulated. A sub\nstantial risk of such gene flow injures respondents in several ways\nthat are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the\nconstitutional standing analysis. Moreover, those harms are readily\nattributable to APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision, which gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered alfalfa va\nrieties. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting the planting or deregula\ntion of all or some genetically engineered alfalfa would redress re\nspondents\u2019 injuries by eliminating or minimizing the risk of gene flow\nto their crops. Pp. 11\u201314.\n   2. The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from\neffecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of\nRRA pending the agency\u2019s completion of its detailed environmental\nreview. Pp. 14\u201322.\n      (a) Because petitioners and the Government do not argue other\nwise, the Court assumes without deciding that the District Court\nacted lawfully in vacating the agency\u2019s decision to completely deregu\nlate RRA. The Court therefore addresses only the injunction prohib\niting APHIS from deregulating RRA pending completion of the EIS,\nand the nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all RRA planting\nduring the pendency of the EIS process. P. 14.\n      (b) Before a court may grant a permanent injunction, the plain\ntiff must satisfy a four-factor test, demonstrating: \u201c(1) that it has suf\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such\nas monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury;\n(3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff\nand defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the pub\nlic interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\u201d eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391. This test fully ap\n4            MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    plies in NEPA cases. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Coun\n    cil, Inc., 555 U. S. ___, ___. Thus, the existence of a NEPA violation\n    does not create a presumption that injunctive relief is available and\n    should be granted absent unusual circumstances. Pp. 15\u201316.\n          (c) None of the four factors supports the District Court\u2019s order en\n    joining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during the pendency\n    of the EIS process. Most importantly, respondents cannot show that\n    they will suffer irreparable injury if APHIS is allowed to proceed with\n    any partial deregulation, for at least two reasons. First, if and when\n    APHIS pursues a partial deregulation that arguably runs afoul of\n    NEPA, respondents may file a new suit challenging such action and\n    seeking appropriate preliminary relief. Accordingly, a permanent in\n    junction is not now needed to guard against any present or imminent\n    risk of likely irreparable harm. Second, a partial deregulation need\n    not cause respondents any injury at all; if its scope is sufficiently lim\n    ited, the risk of gene flow could be virtually nonexistent. Indeed, the\n    broad injunction entered below essentially pre-empts the very proce\n    dure by which APHIS could determine, independently of the pending\n    EIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregulation, that\n    a limited deregulation would not pose any appreciable risk of envi\n    ronmental harm. Pp. 16\u201323.\n          (d) The District Court also erred in entering the nationwide in\n    junction against planting RRA, for two independent reasons. First,\n    because it was inappropriate for the District Court to foreclose even\n    the possibility of a partial and temporary deregulation, it follows that\n    it was inappropriate to enjoin planting in accordance with such a de\n    regulation decision. Second, an injunction is a drastic and extraordi\n    nary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. See,\n    e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312.

The District\nCourt held that APHIS violated the National Environ\u00ad\nmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a74321 et seq., by issuing its deregulation deci\u00ad\nsion without first completing a detailed assessment of\nthe environmental consequences of its proposed course of\naction. To remedy that violation, the District Court\nvacated the agency\u2019s decision completely deregulating\nthe alfalfa variety in question; ordered APHIS not to act\non the deregulation petition in whole or in part until it\nhad completed a detailed environmental review; and\nenjoined almost all future planting of the genetically\nengineered alfalfa pending the completion of that review.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s entry\nof permanent injunctive relief. The main issue now in\ndispute concerns the breadth of that relief. For the\nreasons set forth below, we reverse and remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Plant Protection Act (PPA), 114 Stat. 438, 7 U. S. C.\n\u00a77701 et seq., provides that the Secretary of the Depart\u00ad\nment of Agriculture (USDA) may issue regulations \u201cto\nprevent the introduction of plant pests into the United\nStates or the dissemination of plant pests within the\nUnited States.\u201d \u00a77711(a). The Secretary has delegated\nthat authority to APHIS, a division of the USDA. 7 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a72.22(a), 2.80(a)(36) (2010). Acting pursuant to that\ndelegation, APHIS has promulgated regulations governing\n\u201cthe introduction of organisms and products altered or\nproduced through genetic engineering that are plant pests\nor are believed to be plant pests.\u201d See \u00a7340.0(a)(2) and\nn. 1. Under those regulations, certain genetically engi\u00ad\nneered plants are presumed to be \u201cplant pests\u201d\u2014and thus\n\u201cregulated articles\u201d under the PPA\u2014until APHIS deter\u00ad\nmines otherwise. See ibid.; \u00a7\u00a7340.1, 340.2, 340.6; see also\nApp. 183. However, any person may petition APHIS for a\ndetermination that a regulated article does not present a\nplant pest risk and therefore should not be subject to the\napplicable regulations. 7 U. S. C. \u00a77711(c)(2); 7 CFR\n\u00a7340.6. APHIS may grant such a petition in whole or in\npart. \u00a7340.6(d)(3).\n  In deciding whether to grant nonregulated status to a\ngenetically engineered plant variety, APHIS must comply\nwith NEPA, which requires federal agencies \u201cto the fullest\nextent possible\u201d to prepare an environmental impact\nstatement (EIS) for \u201cevery recommendation or report on\nproposals for legislation and other major Federal actio[n]\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environ\u00ad\nment.\u201d    42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C).     The statutory text\n\u201cspeaks solely in terms of proposed actions; it does not\nrequire an agency to consider the possible environmental\nimpacts of less imminent actions when preparing the\nimpact statement on proposed actions.\u201d Kleppe v. Sierra\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 410, n. 20 (1976).\n  An agency need not complete an EIS for a particular\nproposal if it finds, on the basis of a shorter \u201cenviron\u00ad\nmental assessment\u201d (EA), that the proposed action will not\nhave a significant impact on the environment. 40 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71508.9(a), 1508.13 (2009). Even if a particular agency\nproposal requires an EIS, applicable regulations allow the\nagency to take at least some action in furtherance of that\nproposal while the EIS is being prepared. See \u00a71506.1(a)\n(\u201cno action concerning the proposal shall be taken which\nwould: (1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or (2)\nLimit the choice of reasonable alternatives\u201d); \u00a71506.1(c)\n(\u201cWhile work on a required program environmental impact\nstatement is in progress and the action is not covered by\nan existing program statement, agencies shall not under\u00ad\ntake in the interim any major Federal action covered by\nthe program which may significantly affect the quality of\nthe human environment unless such action\u201d satisfies\ncertain requirements).\n                             B\n   This case involves Roundup Ready Alfalfa (RRA), a kind\nof alfalfa crop that has been genetically engineered to be\ntolerant of glyphosate, the active ingredient of the herbi\u00ad\ncide Roundup. Petitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto)\nowns the intellectual property rights to RRA. Monsanto\nlicenses those rights to co-petitioner Forage Genetics\nInternational (FGI), which is the exclusive developer of\nRRA seed.\n   APHIS initially classified RRA as a regulated article,\nbut in 2004 petitioners sought nonregulated status for two\nstrains of RRA. In response, APHIS prepared a draft EA\nassessing the likely environmental impact of the requested\nderegulation. It then published a notice in the Federal\nRegister advising the public of the deregulation petition\nand soliciting public comments on its draft EA. After\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconsidering the hundreds of public comments that it re\u00ad\nceived, APHIS issued a Finding of No Significant Impact\nand decided to deregulate RRA unconditionally and with\u00ad\nout preparing an EIS. Prior to this decision, APHIS had\nauthorized almost 300 field trials of RRA conducted over a\nperiod of eight years. App. 348.\n   Approximately eight months after APHIS granted RRA\nnonregulated status, respondents (two conventional alfalfa\nseed farms and environmental groups concerned with food\nsafety) filed this action against the Secretary of Agricul\u00ad\nture and certain other officials in Federal District Court,\nchallenging APHIS\u2019s decision to completely deregulate\nRRA. Their complaint alleged violations of NEPA, the\nEndangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 87 Stat. 884, 16\nU. S. C. \u00a71531 et seq., and the PPA. Respondents did not\nseek preliminary injunctive relief pending resolution of\nthose claims. Hence, RRA enjoyed nonregulated status for\napproximately two years. During that period, more than\n3,000 farmers in 48 States planted an estimated 220,000\nacres of RRA. App. 350.\n   In resolving respondents\u2019 NEPA claim, the District\nCourt accepted APHIS\u2019s determination that RRA does not\nhave any harmful health effects on humans or livestock.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 43a; accord, id., at 45a. Neverthe\u00ad\nless, the District Court held that APHIS violated NEPA by\nderegulating RRA without first preparing an EIS. In\nparticular, the court found that APHIS\u2019s EA failed to\nanswer substantial questions concerning two broad conse\u00ad\nquences of its proposed action: first, the extent to which\ncomplete deregulation would lead to the transmission of\nthe gene conferring glyphosate tolerance from RRA to\norganic and conventional alfalfa; and, second, the extent to\nwhich the introduction of RRA would contribute to the\ndevelopment of Roundup-resistant weeds. Id., at 52a. In\nlight of its determination that the deregulation decision\nran afoul of NEPA, the District Court dismissed without\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprejudice respondents\u2019 claims under the ESA and PPA.\n   After these rulings, the District Court granted petition\u00ad\ners permission to intervene in the remedial phase of the\nlawsuit. The court then asked the parties to submit pro\u00ad\nposed judgments embodying their preferred means of\nremedying the NEPA violation. APHIS\u2019s proposed judg\u00ad\nment would have ordered the agency to prepare an EIS,\nvacated the agency\u2019s deregulation decision, and replaced\nthat decision with the terms of the judgment itself. Id., at\n184a (proposed judgment providing that \u201c[the federal]\ndefendants\u2019 [June 14,] 2005 Determination of Nonregu\u00ad\nlated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered for Toler\u00ad\nance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby vacated and\nreplaced by the terms of this judgment\u201d (emphasis added)).\nThe terms of the proposed judgment, in turn, would have\npermitted the continued planting of RRA pending comple\u00ad\ntion of the EIS, subject to six restrictions. Those restric\u00ad\ntions included, among other things, mandatory isolation\ndistances between RRA and non-genetically-engineered\nalfalfa fields in order to mitigate the risk of gene flow;\nmandatory harvesting conditions; a requirement that\nplanting and harvesting equipment that had been in\ncontact with RRA be cleaned prior to any use with conven\u00ad\ntional or organic alfalfa; identification and handling re\u00ad\nquirements for RRA seed; and a requirement that all RRA\nseed producers and hay growers be under contract with\neither Monsanto or FGI and that their contracts require\ncompliance with the other limitations set out in the pro\u00ad\nposed judgment.\n   The District Court rejected APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment.\nIn its preliminary injunction, the District Court prohibited\nalmost all future planting of RRA pending APHIS\u2019s com\u00ad\npletion of the required EIS. But in order to minimize the\nharm to farmers who had relied on APHIS\u2019s deregulation\ndecision, the court expressly allowed those who had al\u00ad\nready purchased RRA to plant their seeds until March 30,\n6        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2007. Id., at 58a. In its subsequently entered permanent\ninjunction and judgment, the court (1) vacated APHIS\u2019s\nderegulation decision; (2) ordered APHIS to prepare an\nEIS before it made any decision on Monsanto\u2019s deregula\u00ad\ntion petition; (3) enjoined the planting of any RRA in the\nUnited States after March 30, 2007, pending APHIS\u2019s\ncompletion of the required EIS; and (4) imposed certain\nconditions (suggested by APHIS) on the handling and\nidentification of already-planted RRA. Id., at 79a, 109a.\nThe District Court denied petitioners\u2019 request for an evi\u00ad\ndentiary hearing.\n   The Government, Monsanto, and FGI appealed, chal\u00ad\nlenging the scope of the relief granted but not disputing\nthe existence of a NEPA violation. See Geertson Seed\nFarms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130, 1136 (2009). A divided\npanel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit af\u00ad\nfirmed. Based on its review of the record, the panel first\nconcluded that the District Court had \u201crecognized that an\ninjunction does not \u2018automatically issue\u2019 when a NEPA\nviolation is found\u201d and had instead based its issuance of\ninjunctive relief on the four-factor test traditionally used\nfor that purpose. Id., at 1137. The panel held that the\nDistrict Court had not committed clear error in making\nany of the subsidiary factual findings on which its assess\u00ad\nment of the four relevant factors was based. And the\npanel rejected the claim that the District Court had not\ngiven sufficient deference to APHIS\u2019s expertise concerning\nthe likely effects of allowing continued planting of RRA on\na limited basis. In the panel\u2019s view, APHIS\u2019s proposed\ninterim measures would have perpetuated a system that\nhad been found by the District Court to have caused envi\u00ad\nronmental harm in the past. Id., at 1139. Hence, the\npanel concluded that the District Court had not abused its\ndiscretion \u201cin choosing to reject APHIS\u2019s proposed mitiga\u00ad\ntion measures in favor of a broader injunction to prevent\nmore irreparable harm from occurring.\u201d Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The panel majority also rejected petitioners\u2019 alternative\nargument that the District Court had erred in declining to\nhold an evidentiary hearing before entering its permanent\ninjunction. Writing in dissent, Judge N. Randy Smith\ndisagreed with that conclusion. In his view, the District\nCourt was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing\nbefore issuing a permanent injunction unless the facts\nwere undisputed or the adverse party expressly waived its\nright to such a hearing. Neither of those two exceptions,\nhe found, applied here.\n  We granted certiorari. 558 U. S. __ (2010).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   At the threshold, respondents contend that petitioners\nlack standing to seek our review of the lower court rulings\nat issue here. We disagree.\n   Standing under Article III of the Constitution requires\nthat an injury be concrete, particularized, and actual or\nimminent; fairly traceable to the challenged action; and\nredressable by a favorable ruling. Horne v. Flores, 557\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8). Petitioners here sat\u00ad\nisfy all three criteria. Petitioners are injured by their\ninability to sell or license RRA to prospective customers\nuntil such time as APHIS completes the required EIS.\nBecause that injury is caused by the very remedial order\nthat petitioners challenge on appeal, it would be redressed\nby a favorable ruling from this Court.\n   Respondents do not dispute that petitioners would have\nstanding to contest the District Court\u2019s permanent injunc\u00ad\ntion order if they had pursued a different litigation strat\u00ad\negy. Instead, respondents argue that the injury of which\npetitioners complain is independently caused by a part of\nthe District Court\u2019s order that petitioners failed to chal\u00ad\nlenge, namely, the vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation deci\u00ad\nsion. The practical consequence of the vacatur, respon\u00ad\n8        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndents contend, was to restore RRA to the status of a regu\u00ad\nlated article; and, subject to certain exceptions not appli\u00ad\ncable here, federal regulations ban the growth and sale of\nregulated articles. Because petitioners did not specifically\nchallenge the District Court\u2019s vacatur, respondents reason,\nthey lack standing to challenge a part of the District\nCourt\u2019s order (i.e., the injunction) that does not cause\npetitioners any injury not also caused by the vacatur. See\nBrief for Respondents 19\u201320.\n   Respondents\u2019 argument fails for two independent rea\u00ad\nsons. First, although petitioners did not challenge the\nvacatur directly, they adequately preserved their objection\nthat the vacated deregulation decision should have been\nreplaced by APHIS\u2019s proposed injunction. Throughout the\nremedial phase of this litigation, one of the main disputes\nbetween the parties has been whether the District Court\nwas required to adopt APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment. See,\ne.g., Intervenor-Appellants\u2019 Opening Brief in No. 07\u201316458\netc. (CA9), p. 59 (urging the Court of Appeals to \u201cvacate\nthe district court\u2019s judgment and remand this case to the\ndistrict court with instructions to enter APHIS\u2019s proposed\nrelief\u201d); Opening Brief of Federal Defendants-Appellants\nin No. 16458 etc. (CA9), pp. 21, 46 (\u201cThe blanket injunc\u00ad\ntion should be narrowed in accordance with APHIS\u2019s\nproposal\u201d); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, 25\u201327, 53\u201354. That\njudgment would have replaced the vacated deregulation\ndecision with an order expressly allowing continued plant\u00ad\ning of RRA subject to certain limited conditions. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 184a (proposed judgment providing that\n\u201c[the federal] defendants\u2019 14 June 2005 Determination of\nNonregulated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered\nfor Tolerance to the Herbicide Glyphosate is hereby va\u00ad\ncated and replaced by the terms of this judgment\u201d (empha\u00ad\nsis added)). Accordingly, if the District Court had adopted\nthe agency\u2019s suggested remedy, there would still be au\u00ad\nthority for the continued planting of RRA, because there\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nwould, in effect, be a new deregulation decision.1\n   Second, petitioners in any case have standing to chal\u00ad\nlenge the part of the District Court\u2019s order enjoining par\u00ad\ntial deregulation. Respondents focus their standing ar\u00ad\ngument on the part of the judgment enjoining the planting\nof RRA, but the judgment also states that \u201c[b]efore grant\u00ad\ning Monsanto\u2019s deregulation petition, even in part, the\nfederal defendants shall prepare an environmental impact\nstatement.\u201d Id., at 108a (emphasis added); see also id., at\n79a (\u201cThe Court will enter a final judgment . . . ordering\nthe government to prepare an EIS before it makes a deci\u00ad\nsion on Monsanto\u2019s deregulation petition\u201d). As respon\u00ad\ndents concede, that part of the judgment goes beyond the\nvacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37, 46.\n   At oral argument, respondents contended that the re\u00ad\ntriction on APHIS\u2019s ability to effect a partial deregulation\nof RRA does not cause petitioners \u201can actual or an immi\u00ad\nnent harm.\u201d Id., at 39\u201340. In order for a partial deregula\u00ad\ntion to occur, respondents argued, the case would have to\nbe remanded to the agency, and APHIS would have to\nprepare an EA \u201cthat may or may not come out in favor of a\npartial deregulation.\u201d Id., at 39. Because petitioners\ncannot prove that those two events would happen, respon\u00ad\ndents contended, the asserted harm caused by the District\nCourt\u2019s partial deregulation ban is too speculative to\nsatisfy the actual or imminent injury requirement.\n   We reject this argument. If the injunction were lifted,\nwe do not see why the District Court would have to re\u00ad\nmand the matter to the agency in order for APHIS to\neffect a partial deregulation. And even if a remand were\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 We need not decide whether the District Court had the authority to\nreplace the vacated agency order with an injunction of its own making.\nThe question whether petitioners are entitled to the relief that they\nseek goes to the merits, not to standing.\n10        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired, we perceive no basis on which the District Court\ncould decline to remand the matter to the agency so that it\ncould determine whether to pursue a partial deregulation\nduring the pendency of the EIS process.\n   Nor is any doubt as to whether APHIS would issue a\nnew EA in favor of a partial deregulation sufficient to\ndefeat petitioners\u2019 standing. It is undisputed that peti\u00ad\ntioners have submitted a deregulation petition and that a\npartial deregulation of the kind embodied in the agency\u2019s\nproposed judgment would afford petitioners much of the\nrelief that they seek; it is also undisputed that, absent the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order, APHIS could attempt to effect such\na partial deregulation pending its completion of the EIS.\nSee id., at 7\u20138, 25\u201327, 38. For purposes of resolving the\nparticular standing question before us, we need not decide\nwhether or to what extent a party challenging an injunc\u00ad\ntion that bars an agency from granting certain relief must\nshow that the agency would be likely to afford such relief\nif it were free to do so. In this case, as is clear from\nAPHIS\u2019s proposed judgment and from its briefing\nthroughout the remedial phase of this litigation, the\nagency takes the view that a partial deregulation reflect\u00ad\ning its proposed limitations is in the public interest. Thus,\nthere is more than a strong likelihood that APHIS would\npartially deregulate RRA were it not for the District\nCourt\u2019s injunction. The District Court\u2019s elimination of\nthat likelihood is plainly sufficient to establish a constitu\u00ad\ntionally cognizable injury. Moreover, as respondents\nessentially conceded at oral argument, that injury would\nbe redressed by a favorable decision here, since \u201cvacating\nthe current injunction . . . will allow [petitioners] to go\nback to the agency, [to] seek a partial deregulation,\u201d even\nif the District Court\u2019s vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation\ndecision is left intact. Id., at 38. We therefore hold that\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners have standing to seek this Court\u2019s review.2\n                              B\n   We next consider petitioners\u2019 contention that respon\u00ad\ndents lack standing to seek injunctive relief. See Daim\nlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 352 (2006) (\u201c[A]\nplaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each\nform of relief sought\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nPetitioners argue that respondents have failed to show\nthat any of the named respondents is likely to suffer a\nconstitutionally cognizable injury absent injunctive relief.\nSee Brief for Petitioners 40. We disagree.\n   Respondents include conventional alfalfa farmers.\nEmphasizing \u201cthe undisputed concentration of alfalfa seed\nfarms,\u201d the District Court found that those farmers had\n\u201cestablished a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that their organic\nand conventional alfalfa crops will be infected with the\nengineered gene\u201d if RRA is completely deregulated. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 50a.3 A substantial risk of gene flow\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 We do not rest \u201cthe primary basis for our jurisdiction on the premise\n\nthat the District Court enjoined APHIS from partially deregulating\nRRA in any sense.\u201d See post, at 7 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Even if the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order prohibiting a partial deregulation applies only to\n\u201cthe particular partial deregulation order proposed to the court by\nAPHIS,\u201d see post, at 8, petitioners would still have standing to chal\u00ad\nlenge that aspect of the order.\n   3At least one of the respondents in this case specifically alleges that\n\nhe owns an alfalfa farm in a prominent seed-growing region and faces a\nsignificant risk of contamination from RRA. See Record, Doc. 62, pp. 1\u2013\n2; id., \u00b610, at 3\u20134 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of Plan\u00ad\ntiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment) (\u201cSince alfalfa is pollinated by\nhoney, bumble and leafcutter bees, the genetic contamination of the\nRoundup Ready seed will rapidly spread through the seed growing\nregions. Bees have a range of at least two to ten miles, and the alfalfa\nseed farms are much more concentrated\u201d). Other declarations in the\nrecord provide further support for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that\nthe deregulation of RRA poses a significant risk of contamination to\nrespondents\u2019 crops. See, e.g., id., Doc. 53, \u00b69, at 2 (Declaration of Jim\nMunsch) (alleging risk of \u201csignificant contamination . . . due to the\n12         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ninjures respondents in several ways. For example, re\u00ad\nspondents represent that, in order to continue marketing\ntheir product to consumers who wish to buy non\u00ad\ngenetically-engineered alfalfa, respondents would have to\nconduct testing to find out whether and to what extent\ntheir crops have been contaminated. See, e.g., Record,\nDoc. 62, p. 5 (Declaration of Phillip Geertson in Support of\nPlantiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment) (hereinafter\nGeertson Declaration) (\u201cDue to the high potential for\ncontamination, I will need to test my crops for the pres\u00ad\nence of genetically engineered alfalfa seed. This testing\nwill be a new cost to my seed business and we will have to\nraise our seed prices to cover these costs, making our\nprices less competitive\u201d); id., Doc. 57, p. 4 (Declaration of\nPatrick Trask in Support of Plantiff\u2019s Motion for Summary\nJudgment) (\u201cTo ensure that my seeds are pure, I will need\nto test my crops and obtain certification that my seeds are\nfree of genetically engineered alfalfa\u201d); see also Record,\nDoc. 55, p. 2 (\u201cThere is zero tolerance for contaminated\nseed in the organic market\u201d). Respondents also allege that\nthe risk of gene flow will cause them to take certain meas\u00ad\nures to minimize the likelihood of potential contamination\nand to ensure an adequate supply of non-genetically\u00ad\nengineered alfalfa. See, e.g., Geertson Declaration 3 (not\u00ad\ning the \u201cincreased cost of alfalfa breeding due to potential\nfor genetic contamination\u201d); id., at 6 (\u201cDue to the threat of\ncontamination, I have begun contracting with growers\noutside of the United States to ensure that I can supply\ngenetically pure, conventional alfalfa seed. Finding new\ngrowers has already resulted in increased administrative\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncompact geographic area of the prime alfalfa seed producing areas and\nthe fact that pollen is distributed by bees that have large natural range\nof activity\u201d); App. \u00b68, p. 401 (Declaration of Marc Asumendi) (\u201cRoundup\nalfalfa seed fields are currently being planted in all the major alfalfa\nseed production areas with little regard to contamination to non-GMO\nseed production fields\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncosts at my seed business\u201d).\n   Such harms, which respondents will suffer even if their\ncrops are not actually infected with the Roundup ready\ngene, are sufficiently concrete to satisfy the injury-in-fact\nprong of the constitutional standing analysis. Those\nharms are readily attributable to APHIS\u2019s deregulation\ndecision, which, as the District Court found, gives rise to a\nsignificant risk of gene flow to non-genetically-engineered\nvarieties of alfalfa. Finally, a judicial order prohibiting\nthe growth and sale of all or some genetically engineered\nalfalfa would remedy respondents\u2019 injuries by eliminating\nor minimizing the risk of gene flow to conventional and\norganic alfalfa crops. We therefore conclude that respon\u00ad\ndents have constitutional standing to seek injunctive relief\nfrom the complete deregulation order at issue here.\n   Petitioners appear to suggest that respondents fail to\nsatisfy the \u201czone of interests\u201d test we have previously\narticulated as a prudential standing requirement in cases\nchallenging agency compliance with particular statutes.\nSee Reply Brief for Petitioners 12 (arguing that protection\nagainst the risk of commercial harm \u201cis not an interest\nthat NEPA was enacted to address\u201d); Bennett v. Spear, 520\nU. S. 154, 162\u2013163 (1997). That argument is unpersua\u00ad\nsive because, as the District Court found, respondents\u2019\ninjury has an environmental as well as an economic com\u00ad\nponent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. In its ruling on the\nmerits of respondents\u2019 NEPA claim, the District Court\nheld that the risk that the RRA gene conferring gly\u00ad\nphosate resistance will infect conventional and organic\nalfalfa is a significant environmental effect within the\nmeaning of NEPA. Petitioners did not appeal that part of\nthe court\u2019s ruling, and we have no occasion to revisit it\nhere. Respondents now seek injunctive relief in order to\navert the risk of gene flow to their crops\u2014the very same\neffect that the District Court determined to be a signifi\u00ad\ncant environmental concern for purposes of NEPA. The\n14        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmere fact that respondents also seek to avoid certain\neconomic harms that are tied to the risk of gene flow does\nnot strip them of prudential standing.\n  In short, respondents have standing to seek injunctive\nrelief, and petitioners have standing to seek this Court\u2019s\nreview of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment affirming the entry\nof such relief. We therefore proceed to the merits of the\ncase.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n   The District Court sought to remedy APHIS\u2019s NEPA\nviolation in three ways: First, it vacated the agency\u2019s\ndecision completely deregulating RRA; second, it enjoined\nAPHIS from deregulating RRA, in whole or in part, pend\u00ad\ning completion of the mandated EIS; and third, it entered\na nationwide injunction prohibiting almost all future\nplanting of RRA. Id., at 108a\u2013110a. Because petitioners\nand the Government do not argue otherwise, we assume\nwithout deciding that the District Court acted lawfully in\nvacating the deregulation decision. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\n(\u201c[T]he district court could have vacated the order in its\nentirety and sent it back to the agency\u201d); accord, id., at 15\u2013\n16. We therefore address only the latter two aspects of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment. Before doing so, however, we\nprovide a brief overview of the standard governing the\nentry of injunctive relief.\n                              B\n  \u201c[A] plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must\nsatisfy a four-factor test before a court may grant such\nrelief. A plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) that it has suf\u00ad\nfered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at\nlaw, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to com\u00ad\npensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of\nhardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nin equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest\nwould not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\u201d eBay\nInc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 U. S. 388, 391 (2006).\nThe traditional four-factor test applies when a plaintiff\nseeks a permanent injunction to remedy a NEPA violation.\nSee Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555\nU. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 21\u201323).\n   Petitioners argue that the lower courts in this case\nproceeded on the erroneous assumption that an injunction\nis generally the appropriate remedy for a NEPA violation.\nIn particular, petitioners note that the District Court cited\npre-Winter Ninth Circuit precedent for the proposition\nthat, in \u201c \u2018the run of the mill NEPA case,\u2019 \u201d an injunction\ndelaying the contemplated government project is proper\n\u201c \u2018until the NEPA violation is cured.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 65a (quoting Idaho Watersheds Project v. Hahn, 307\nF. 3d 815, 833 (CA9 2002)); see also App. to Pet. for Cert.\n55a (quoting same language in preliminary injunction\norder). In addition, petitioners observe, the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals in this case both stated that, \u201cin\nunusual circumstances, an injunction may be withheld, or,\nmore likely, limited in scope\u201d in NEPA cases. Id., at 66a\n(quoting National Parks & Conservation Assn. v. Babbitt,\n241 F. 3d 722, 737, n. 18 (CA9 2001) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); 570 F. 3d, at 1137.\n   Insofar as the statements quoted above are intended to\nguide the determination whether to grant injunctive relief,\nthey invert the proper mode of analysis. An injunction\nshould issue only if the traditional four-factor test is satis\u00ad\nfied. See Winter, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 21\u201324). In\ncontrast, the statements quoted above appear to presume\nthat an injunction is the proper remedy for a NEPA viola\u00ad\ntion except in unusual circumstances. No such thumb on\nthe scales is warranted. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of\nthe Court of Appeals, could any such error be cured by a\ncourt\u2019s perfunctory recognition that \u201can injunction does\n16          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnot automatically issue\u201d in NEPA cases. See 570 F. 3d, at\n1137 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is not enough\nfor a court considering a request for injunctive relief to ask\nwhether there is a good reason why an injunction should\nnot issue; rather, a court must determine that an injunc\u00ad\ntion should issue under the traditional four-factor test set\nout above.\n   Notwithstanding the lower courts\u2019 apparent reliance on\nthe incorrect standard set out in the pre-Winter Circuit\nprecedents quoted above, respondents argue that the\nlower courts in fact applied the traditional four-factor test.\nIn their view, the statements that injunctive relief is\nproper in the \u201crun-of-the-mill\u201d NEPA case, and that such\ninjunctions are granted except in \u201cunusual circumstances,\u201d\nare descriptive rather than prescriptive. See Brief for\nRespondents 28, n. 14. We need not decide whether re\u00ad\nspondents\u2019 characterization of the lower court opinions in\nthis case is sound. Even if it is, the injunctive relief\ngranted here cannot stand.\n                            C\n  We first consider whether the District Court erred in\nenjoining APHIS from partially deregulating RRA during\nthe pendency of the EIS process.4\n  The relevant part of the District Court\u2019s judgment states\nthat, \u201c[b]efore granting Monsanto\u2019s deregulation petition,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Petitionersfocus their challenge on the part of the District Court\u2019s\norder prohibiting the planting of RRA. As we explain below, however,\nthe broad injunction against planting cannot be valid if the injunction\nagainst partial deregulation is improper. See infra, at 23; see also App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 64a (District Court order recognizing that APHIS\u2019s\nproposed remedy \u201cseek[s], in effect, a partial deregulation that permits\nthe continued expansion of the Roundup Ready alfalfa market subject\nto certain conditions\u201d (emphasis added)). The validity of the injunction\nprohibiting partial deregulation is therefore properly before us. Like\nthe District Court, we use the term \u201cpartial deregulation\u201d to refer to\nany limited or conditional deregulation. See id., at 64a, 69a.\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neven in part, the federal defendants shall prepare an\nenvironmental impact statement.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n108a (emphasis added); see also id., at 79a (\u201cThe Court\nwill enter a final judgment . . . ordering the government to\nprepare an EIS before it makes a decision on Monsanto\u2019s\nderegulation petition\u201d). The plain text of the order prohib\u00ad\nits any partial deregulation, not just the particular partial\nderegulation embodied in APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment.\nWe think it is quite clear that the District Court meant\njust what it said. The related injunction against planting\nstates that \u201cno [RRA] . . . may be planted\u201d \u201c[u]ntil the\nfederal defendants prepare the EIS and decide the deregu\u00ad\nlation petition.\u201d Id., at 108a (emphasis added). That\ninjunction, which appears in the very same judgment and\ndirectly follows the injunction against granting Mon\u00ad\nsanto\u2019s petition \u201ceven in part,\u201d does not carve out an ex\u00ad\nception for planting subsequently authorized by a valid\npartial deregulation decision.\n   In our view, none of the traditional four factors govern\u00ad\ning the entry of permanent injunctive relief supports the\nDistrict Court\u2019s injunction prohibiting partial deregula\u00ad\ntion. To see why that is so, it is helpful to understand how\nthe injunction prohibiting a partial deregulation fits into\nthe broader dispute between the parties.\n   Respondents in this case brought suit under the APA to\nchallenge a particular agency order: APHIS\u2019s decision to\ncompletely deregulate RRA. The District Court held that\nthe order in question was procedurally defective, and\nAPHIS decided not to appeal that determination. At that\npoint, it was for the agency to decide whether and to what\nextent it would pursue a partial deregulation. If the\nagency found, on the basis of a new EA, that a limited and\ntemporary deregulation satisfied applicable statutory and\nregulatory requirements, it could proceed with such a\nderegulation even if it had not yet finished the onerous\nEIS required for complete deregulation. If and when the\n18         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nagency were to issue a partial deregulation order, any\nparty aggrieved by that order could bring a separate suit\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the\nparticular deregulation attempted. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7702.\n   In this case, APHIS apparently sought to \u201cstreamline\u201d\nthe proceedings by asking the District Court to craft a\nremedy that, in effect, would have partially deregulated\nRRA until such time as the agency had finalized the EIS\nneeded for a complete deregulation. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n16, 23\u201324; App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a. To justify that dispo\u00ad\nsition, APHIS and petitioners submitted voluminous\ndocumentary submissions in which they purported to show\nthat the risk of gene flow would be insignificant if the\nDistrict Court allowed limited planting and harvesting\nsubject to APHIS\u2019s proposed conditions. Respondents, in\nturn, submitted considerable evidence of their own that\nseemed to cut the other way. This put the District Court\nin an unenviable position. \u201cThe parties\u2019 experts disagreed\nover virtually every factual issue relating to possible\nenvironmental harm, including the likelihood of genetic\ncontamination and why some contamination had already\noccurred.\u201d 570 F. 3d, at 1135.\n   The District Court may well have acted within its dis\u00ad\ncretion in refusing to craft a judicial remedy that would\nhave authorized the continued planting and harvesting of\nRRA while the EIS is being prepared. It does not follow,\nhowever, that the District Court was within its rights in\nenjoining APHIS from allowing such planting and harvest\u00ad\ning pursuant to the authority vested in the agency by law.\nWhen the District Court entered its permanent injunction,\nAPHIS had not yet exercised its authority to partially\nderegulate RRA. Until APHIS actually seeks to effect a\npartial deregulation, any judicial review of such a decision\nis premature.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 5 NEPA   provides that an EIS must be \u201cinclude[d] in every recommen\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  19\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Nor can the District Court\u2019s injunction be justified as a\nprophylactic measure needed to guard against the possi\u00ad\nbility that the agency would seek to effect on its own the\nparticular partial deregulation scheme embodied in the\nterms of APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment. Even if the District\nCourt was not required to adopt that judgment, there was\nno need to stop the agency from effecting a partial deregu\u00ad\nlation in accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw. Moreover, the terms of the District Court\u2019s injunction\ndo not just enjoin the particular partial deregulation\nembodied in APHIS\u2019s proposed judgment. Instead, the\nDistrict Court barred the agency from pursuing any de\u00ad\nregulation\u2014no matter how limited the geographic area in\nwhich planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the\nisolation distances mandated between RRA fields and\nfields for growing non-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how\nstringent the regulations governing harvesting and distri\u00ad\nbution, how robust the enforcement mechanisms available\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal\nactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d\n42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C) (emphasis added); see also Kleppe v. Sierra\nClub, 427 U. S. 390, 406 (1976) (\u201cA court has no authority to depart\nfrom the statutory language and . . . determine a point during the\ngermination process of a potential proposal at which an impact state\u00ad\nment should be prepared\u201d (first emphasis added)). When a particular\nagency proposal exists and requires the preparation of an EIS, NEPA\nregulations allow the agency to take at least some action pertaining to\nthat proposal during the pendency of the EIS process. See 40 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71506.1(a), (c) (2009). We do not express any view on the Govern\u00ad\nment\u2019s contention that a limited deregulation of the kind embodied in\nits proposed judgment would not require the prior preparation of an\nEIS. See Brief for Federal Respondents 21\u201322 (citing \u00a71506.1(a)); Tr. of\nOral Arg. 20 (\u201cwhat we were proposing for the interim, that is allowing\ncontinued planting subject to various protective measures, was funda\u00ad\nmentally different from the action on which the EIS was being pre\u00ad\npared\u201d). Because APHIS has not yet invoked the procedures necessary\nto attempt a limited deregulation, any judicial consideration of such\nissues is not warranted at this time.\n20        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nat the time of the decision, and\u2014consequently\u2014no matter\nhow small the risk that the planting authorized under\nsuch conditions would adversely affect the environment in\ngeneral and respondents in particular.\n   The order enjoining any partial deregulation was also\ninconsistent with other aspects of the very same judgment.\nIn fashioning its remedy for the NEPA violation, the\nDistrict Court steered a \u201cmiddle course\u201d between more\nextreme options on either end. See id., at 1136. On the\none hand, the District Court rejected APHIS\u2019s proposal\n(supported by petitioners) to allow continued planting and\nharvesting of RRA subject to the agency\u2019s proposed limita\u00ad\ntions. On the other hand, the District Court did not bar\ncontinued planting of RRA as a regulated article under\npermit from APHIS, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a, and it\nexpressly allowed farmers to harvest and sell RRA planted\nbefore March 30, 2007, id., at 76a\u201379a. If the District\nCourt was right to conclude that any partial deregulation,\nno matter how limited, required the preparation of an EIS,\nit is hard to see why the limited planting and harvesting\nthat the District Court allowed did not also require the\npreparation of an EIS. Conversely, if the District Court\nwas right to conclude that the limited planting and har\u00ad\nvesting it allowed did not require the preparation of an\nEIS, then an appropriately limited partial deregulation\nshould likewise have been possible.\n   Based on the analysis set forth above, it is clear that the\norder enjoining any deregulation whatsoever does not\nsatisfy the traditional four-factor test for granting perma\u00ad\nnent injunctive relief. Most importantly, respondents\ncannot show that they will suffer irreparable injury if\nAPHIS is allowed to proceed with any partial deregula\u00ad\ntion, for at least two independent reasons.\n   First, if and when APHIS pursues a partial deregulation\nthat arguably runs afoul of NEPA, respondents may file a\nnew suit challenging such action and seeking appropriate\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npreliminary relief. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7702, 705. Accordingly,\na permanent injunction is not now needed to guard\nagainst any present or imminent risk of likely irreparable\nharm.\n   Second, a partial deregulation need not cause respon\u00ad\ndents any injury at all, much less irreparable injury; if the\nscope of the partial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the\nrisk of gene flow to their crops could be virtually nonexis\u00ad\ntent. For example, suppose that APHIS deregulates RRA\nonly in a remote part of the country in which respondents\nneither grow nor intend to grow non-genetically\u00ad\nengineered alfalfa, and in which no conventional alfalfa\nfarms are currently located. Suppose further that APHIS\nissues an accompanying administrative order mandating\nisolation distances so great as to eliminate any apprecia\u00ad\nble risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional farmers\nwho might someday choose to plant in the surrounding\narea. See, e.g., Brief in Opposition 9, n. 6 (quoting study\nconcluding \u201c \u2018that in order for there to be zero tolerance of\nany gene flow between a [RRA] seed field and a conven\u00ad\ntional seed field, those fields would have to have a five\u00ad\nmile isolation distance between them\u2019 \u201d); see also Tr. of\nOral Arg. 15\u201316 (representation from the Solicitor General\nthat APHIS may impose conditions on the deregulation of\nRRA via issuance of an administrative order). Finally,\nsuppose that APHIS concludes in a new EA that its lim\u00ad\nited deregulation would not pose a significant risk of gene\nflow or harmful weed development, and that the agency\nadopts a plan to police vigorously compliance with its\nadministrative order in the limited geographic area in\nquestion. It is hard to see how respondents could show\nthat such a limited deregulation would cause them likely\nirreparable injury. (Respondents in this case do not repre\u00ad\nsent a class, so they could not seek to enjoin such an order\non the ground that it might cause harm to other parties.)\nIn any case, the District Court\u2019s order prohibiting any\n22          MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npartial deregulation improperly relieves respondents of\ntheir burden to make the requisite evidentiary showing.6\n   Of course, APHIS might ultimately choose not to par\u00ad\ntially deregulate RRA during the pendency of the EIS, or\nelse to pursue the kind of partial deregulation embodied in\nits proposed judgment rather than the very limited de\u00ad\nregulation envisioned in the above hypothetical. Until\nsuch time as the agency decides whether and how to exer\u00ad\ncise its regulatory authority, however, the courts have no\ncause to intervene. Indeed, the broad injunction entered\nhere essentially pre-empts the very procedure by which\nthe agency could determine, independently of the pending\nEIS process for assessing the effects of a complete deregu\u00ad\nlation, that a limited deregulation would not pose any\nappreciable risk of environmental harm. See 40 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a71501.4, 1508.9(a) (2009).\n   In sum, we do not know whether and to what extent\nAPHIS would seek to effect a limited deregulation during\nthe pendency of the EIS process if it were free to do so; we\ndo know that the vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregulation decision\nmeans that virtually no RRA can be grown or sold until\nsuch time as a new deregulation decision is in place, and\nwe also know that any party aggrieved by a hypothetical\nfuture deregulation decision will have ample opportunity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The District Court itself appears to have recognized that its broad\n\ninjunction may not have been necessary to avert any injury to respon\u00ad\ndents. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a (\u201cIt does complicate it to try to\nfine-tune a particular remedy.

Petitioners argue that the District Court did not\napply the right test for determining whether to enter\npermanent injunctive relief; that, even if the District\nCourt identified the operative legal standard, it erred as a\nmatter of law in applying that standard to the facts of this\ncase; and that the District Court was required to grant\npetitioners an evidentiary hearing to resolve contested\nissues of fact germane to the remedial dispute between the\nparties. We agree that the District Court\u2019s injunction\nagainst planting went too far, but we come to that conclu\u00ad\nsion for two independent reasons.\n   First, the impropriety of the District Court\u2019s broad\ninjunction against planting flows from the impropriety of\nits injunction against partial deregulation. If APHIS may\npartially deregulate RRA before preparing a full-blown\nEIS\u2014a question that we need not and do not decide here\u2014\nfarmers should be able to grow and sell RRA in accordance\nwith that agency determination. Because it was inappro\u00ad\npriate for the District Court to foreclose even the possibil\u00ad\nity of a partial and temporary deregulation, it necessarily\nfollows that it was likewise inappropriate to enjoin any\nand all parties from acting in accordance with the terms of\nsuch a deregulation decision.\n   Second, respondents have represented to this Court that\n24       MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe District Court\u2019s injunction against planting does not\nhave any meaningful practical effect independent of its\nvacatur. See Brief for Respondents 24; see also Tr. of Oral\nArg. 37 (\u201c[T]he mistake that was made [by the District\nCourt] was in not appreciating . . . that the vacatur did\nhave [the] effect\u201d of independently prohibiting the growth\nand sale of almost all RRA). An injunction is a drastic and\nextraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a\nmatter of course. See, e.g., Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo,\n456 U. S. 305, 311\u2013312 (1982). If a less drastic remedy\n(such as partial or complete vacatur of APHIS\u2019s deregula\u00ad\ntion decision) was sufficient to redress respondents\u2019 injury,\nno recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an\ninjunction was warranted. See ibid.; see also Winter, 555\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21\u201323).\n                             E\n   In sum, the District Court abused its discretion in en\u00ad\njoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in\nprohibiting the possibility of planting in accordance with\nthe terms of such a deregulation. Given those errors, this\nCourt need not express any view on whether injunctive\nrelief of some kind was available to respondents on the\nrecord before us. Nor does the Court address the question\nwhether the District Court was required to conduct an\nevidentiary hearing before entering the relief at issue\nhere. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a,\n54a, 62a. Second, even planting in a controlled setting\nhad led to contamination in some instances. See id., at\n69a\u201370a. Third, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection\nService (APHIS) has limited ability to monitor or enforce\nlimitations on planting. See id., at 70a. And fourth,\ngenetic contamination from RRA could decimate farmers\u2019\nlivelihoods and the American alfalfa market for years to\ncome. See id., at 71a; see also id., at 29a\u201330a. Instead,\nthe majority faults the District Court for \u201cenjoining\nAPHIS from partially deregulating RRA.\u201d Ante, at 16.\n   In my view, the District Court may not have actually\nordered such relief, and we should not so readily assume\nthat it did. Regardless, the District Court did not abuse\nits discretion when, after considering the voluminous\nrecord and making the aforementioned findings, it issued\nthe order now before us.\n                           I\n  To understand the District Court\u2019s judgment, it is nec\nessary to understand the background of this litigation.\nPetitioner Monsanto Company (Monsanto) is a large cor\n2        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nporation that has long produced a weed killer called\nRoundup. After years of experimentation, Monsanto and\nco-petitioner Forage Genetics International (FGI) geneti\ncally engineered a mutation in the alfalfa genome that\nmakes the plant immune to Roundup. Monsanto and\nFGI\u2019s new product, RRA, is \u201cthe first crop that has been\nengineered to resist a[n] herbicide\u201d and that can transmit\nthe genetically engineered gene to other plants. See App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 45a.\n   In 2004, in the midst of a deregulatory trend in the\nagricultural sector, petitioners asked APHIS to deregulate\nRRA, thereby allowing it to be sold and planted nation\nwide. App. 101a. Rather than conducting a detailed\nanalysis and preparing an \u201cenvironmental impact state\nment\u201d (EIS), as required by the National Environmental\nPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for every \u201cmajor Federal ac\ntio[n] significantly affecting the quality of the human\nenvironment,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a74332(2)(C), APHIS merely\nconducted an abbreviated \u201cenvironmental assessment\u201d\n(EA). During the 6-month period in which APHIS allowed\npublic comment on its EA, the agency received 663 com\nments, 520 of which opposed deregulation. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 29a. Farmers and scientists opined that RRA could\ncontaminate alfalfa that has not been genetically modified,\ndestroying the American export market for alfalfa and,\npotentially, contaminating other plants and breeding a\nnew type of pesticide-resistant weed. Id., at 29a\u201330a.\n   Despite substantial evidence that RRA genes could\ntransfer to other plants, APHIS issued a Finding of No\nSignificant Impact and agreed to deregulate RRA \u201cuncon\nditionally,\u201d ante, at 4. With no EIS to wait for and no\nregulation blocking its path, petitioners began selling\nRRA. Farmers and environmental groups swiftly brought\nthis lawsuit to challenge APHIS\u2019s decision to deregulate,\nraising claims under NEPA and other statutes.\n   The District Court carefully reviewed a long record and\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             3\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfound that \u201cAPHIS\u2019s reasons for concluding\u201d that the risks\nof genetic contamination are low were \u201cnot \u2018convincing.\u2019 \u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 38a. A review of APHIS\u2019s internal\ndocuments showed that individuals within the agency\nwarned that contamination might occur. APHIS rested its\ndecision to deregulate on its assertion that contamination\nrisk is \u201cnot significant because it is the organic and con\nventional farmers\u2019 responsibility\u201d to protect themselves\nand the environment. Ibid. Yet the agency drew this\nconclusion without having investigated whether such\nfarmers \u201ccan, in fact, protect their crops from contamina\ntion.\u201d Ibid. The District Court likewise found that\nAPHIS\u2019s reasons for disregarding the risk of pesticide\nresistant weeds were speculative and \u201cnot convincing.\u201d\nId., at 46a. The agency had merely explained that if\nweeds acquire roundup resistance, farmers can use \u201c \u2018[a]l\nternative herbicides.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. In light of the \u201cacknowl\nedged\u201d risk of RRA gene transmission and the potential\n\u201cimpact on the development of Roundup resistant weeds,\u201d\nthe court concluded that there was a significant possibility\nof serious environmental harm, and granted summary\njudgment for the plaintiffs. Id., at 54a; see also id., at 45a.\n   At this point, the question of remedy arose. The parties\nsubmitted proposed final judgments, and several corpora\ntions with an interest in RRA, including Monsanto, sought\npermission to intervene. The District Court granted their\nmotion and agreed \u201cto give them the opportunity to pre\nsent evidence to assist the court in fashioning the appro\npriate scope of whatever relief is granted.\u201d Id., at 54a\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   While the District Court considered the proposed judg\nments, it issued a preliminary injunction. Ordinarily, the\ncourt explained, the remedy for failure to conduct an EIS\nis to vacate the permit that was unlawfully given\u2014the\nresult of which, in this case, would be to prohibit any use\nof RRA. See id., at 55a; see also id., at 65a. But this case\n4        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                   STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\npresented a special difficulty: Following APHIS\u2019s unlawful\nderegulation order, some farmers had begun planting\ngenetically modified RRA. Id., at 55a. In its preliminary\ninjunction, the District Court ordered that no new RRA\ncould be planted until APHIS completed the EIS or the\ncourt determined that some other relief was appropriate.\nBut, so as to protect these farmers, the court declined to\nprohibit them from \u201charvesting, using, or selling\u201d any\ncrops they had already planted. Id., at 56a. And \u201cto\nminimize the harm to those growers who intend to immi\nnently plant Roundup Ready alfalfa,\u201d the court permitted\n\u201c[t]hose growers who intend to plant [RRA] in the next\nthree weeks and have already purchased the seed\u201d to go\nahead and plant. Id., at 58a (emphasis deleted). Essen\ntially, the court grandfathered in those farmers who had\nrelied, in good faith, on APHIS\u2019s actions.\n   Before determining the scope of its final judgment, the\nDistrict Court invited the parties and intervenors to sub\nmit \u201cwhatever additional evidence\u201d they \u201cwish[ed] to\nprovide,\u201d and it scheduled additional oral argument. Id.,\nat 58a\u201359a. The parties submitted \u201ccompeting proposals\nfor permanent injunctive relief.\u201d Id., at 60a. The plain\ntiffs requested that no one\u2014not even the grandfathered-in\nfarmers\u2014be allowed to plant, grow, or harvest RRA until\nthe full EIS had been prepared. Id., at 64a. APHIS and\nthe intervenors instead sought a remedy that would \u201cfa\ncilitat[e] the continued and dramatic growth\u201d of RRA: a\n\u201cpartial deregulation\u201d order that would permit planting\nsubject to certain conditions, such as specified minimum\ndistances between RRA and conventional alfalfa and\nspecial cleaning requirements for equipment used on the\ngenetically modified crop. See id., at 60a\u201364a.\n   The court adopted a compromise. First, it declined to\nadopt the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. APHIS itself had\nacknowledged that \u201cgene transmission could and had\noccurred,\u201d and that RRA \u201ccould result in the development\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           5\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nof Roundup-resistant weeds.\u201d Id., at 61a\u201362a. In light of\nthe substantial record evidence of these risks, the court\nwould not agree to a nationwide planting scheme \u201cwithout\nthe benefit of the development of all the relevant data,\u201d as\nwell as public comment about whether contamination\ncould be controlled. Id., at 68a. The \u201cpartial deregulation\u201d\nproposed by petitioners, the court noted, was really \u201cde\nregulation with certain conditions,\u201d id., at 69a\u2014which, for\nthe same reasons given in the court\u2019s earlier order, re\nquires an EIS, ibid. The court pointed out numerous\nproblems with the APHIS-Monsanto proposal. Neither\nAPHIS nor Monsanto had provided \u201cevidence that sug\ngests whether, and to what extent, the proposed interim\nconditions\u201d would actually \u201cbe followed,\u201d and comparable\nconditions had failed to prevent contamination in certain\nlimited settings. Id., at 69a\u201370a. APHIS, moreover,\nconceded that \u201cit does not have the resources to inspect\u201d\nthe RRA that had already been planted, and so could not\npossibly be expected \u201cto adequately monitor the more than\none million acres of [RRA] intervenors estimate [would] be\nplanted\u201d under their proposal. Ibid. That was especially\nproblematic because any plan to limit contamination\ndepended on rules about harvesting, and farmers were\nunlikely to follow those rules. Id., at 71a. \u201cAPHIS ha[d]\nstill not made any inquiry\u201d into numerous factual concerns\nraised by the court in its summary judgment order issued\nseveral months earlier. Id., at 70a.\n  Next, the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed remedy\nof \u201cenjoin[ing] the harvesting and sale of already planted\u201d\nRRA. Id., at 76a. Although any planting or harvesting of\nRRA poses a contamination risk, the court reasoned that\nthe equities were different for those farmers who had\nalready invested time and money planting RRA in good\nfaith reliance on APHIS\u2019s deregulation order. And small\namounts of harvesting could be more easily monitored.\nRather than force the farmers to tear up their crops, the\n6        MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ncourt imposed a variety of conditions on the crops\u2019 han\ndling and distribution. Id., at 77a.\n   As to all other RRA, however, the court sided with the\nplaintiffs and enjoined planting during the pendency of\nthe EIS. Balancing the equities, the court explained that\nthe risk of harm was great. \u201c[C]ontamination cannot be\nundone; it will destroy the crops of those farmers who do\nnot sell genetically modified alfalfa.\u201d Id., at 71a. And\nbecause those crops \u201ccannot be replanted for two to four\nyears,\u201d that loss will be even greater. Ibid. On the other\nside of the balance, the court recognized that some farmers\nmay wish to switch to genetically modified alfalfa immedi\nately, and some companies like Monsanto want to start\nselling it to them just as fast. But, the court noted, RRA is\na small percentage of those companies\u2019 overall business;\nunsold seed can be stored; and the companies \u201c \u2018have [no]\ncause to claim surprise\u2019 \u201d as to any loss of anticipated\nrevenue, as they \u201cwere aware of plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit\u201d and\n\u201cnonetheless chose to market\u201d RRA. Id., at 72a.\n   Thus, the District Court stated that it would \u201cvacat[e]\nthe June 2005 deregulation decision\u201d; \u201cenjoi[n] the plant\ning of [RRA] in the United States after March 30, 2007,\u201d\nthe date of the decision, \u201cpending the government\u2019s com\npletion of the EIS and decision on the deregulation peti\ntion\u201d; and impose \u201cconditions on the handling and identifi\ncation of already-planted [RRA].\u201d Id., at 79a. On the\nsame day, the court issued its judgment. In relevant part,\nthe judgment states:\n    \u201cThe federal defendants\u2019 June 14, 2005 Determination\n    of Nonregulated Status for [RRA] is VACATED.

The Court today rests\nnot only the bulk of its analysis but also the primary basis\nfor our jurisdiction on the premise that the District Court\nenjoined APHIS from partially deregulating RRA in any\nsense. See ante, at 9\u201311, 16\u201323.1 That is a permissible,\nbut not necessarily correct, reading of the District Court\u2019s\njudgment.\n  So far as I can tell, until petitioners\u2019 reply brief, neither\npetitioners nor the Government submitted to us that the\nDistrict Court had exceeded its authority in this manner.\nAnd, indeed, the Government had not raised this issue in\nany court at all. Petitioners did not raise the issue in any\nof their three questions presented or in the body of their\npetition for a writ or certiorari. And they did not raise the\nissue in their opening briefs to this Court. Only after\nrespondents alleged that Monsanto\u2019s injury would not be\nredressed by vacating the injunction, insofar as RRA\nwould still be a regulated article, did petitioners bring the\nissue to the Court\u2019s attention. Explaining why they have a\nredressable injury, petitioners alleged that the District\nCourt\u2019s order prevents APHIS from \u201cimplement[ing] an[y]\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See also ante, at 19\u201320 (\u201c[T]he District Court barred the agency\n\nfrom pursuing any deregulation\u2014no matter how limited the geographic\narea in which planting of RRA would be allowed, how great the isola\ntion distances mandated between RRA fields and fields for growing\nnon-genetically-engineered alfalfa, how stringent the regulations\ngoverning harvesting and distribution, how robust the enforcement\nmechanisms available at the time of the decision, and\u2014consequently\u2014\nno matter how small the risk that the planting authorized under such\nconditions would adversely affect the environment in general and\nrespondents in particular\u201d (emphasis deleted)).\n8         MONSANTO CO. v. GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ninterim solution allowing continued planting.\u201d Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 5. APHIS, the party that the Court says\nwas wrongly \u201cbarred . . . from pursuing any deregulation,\u201d\neven \u201cin accordance with the procedures established by\nlaw,\u201d ante, at 19, did not complain about this aspect of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order even in its reply brief.\n  Thus, notwithstanding that petitioners \u201cadequately\npreserved their objection that the vacated deregulation\ndecision should have been replaced by APHIS\u2019s proposed\ninjunction,\u201d ante, at 8 (emphasis added), the key legal\npremise on which the Court decides this case was never\nadequately presented. Of course, this is not standard\u2014or\nsound\u2014judicial practice. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmi\nchael, 526 U. S. 137, 159 (1999) (STEVENS, J., concurring\nin part and dissenting in part). Today\u2019s decision illus\ntrates why, for it is quite unclear whether the Court\u2019s\npremise is correct, and the Court has put itself in the\nposition of deciding legal issues without the aid of briefing.\n  In my view, the District Court\u2019s judgment can fairly be\nread to address only (1) total deregulation orders of the\nkind that spawned this lawsuit, and (2) the particular\npartial deregulation order proposed to the court by APHIS.\nThis interpretation of the judgment is more consistent\nwith the District Court\u2019s accompanying opinion, which\nconcluded by stating that the court \u201cwill enter a final\njudgment\u201d \u201cordering the government to prepare an EIS\nbefore [the court] makes a decision on Monsanto\u2019s deregu\nlation petition.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a. The language\nof that opinion does not appear to \u201cba[r] the agency from\npursuing any deregulation\u2014no matter how limited,\u201d ante,\nat 19 (emphasis deleted). This interpretation is also more\nconsistent with APHIS\u2019s own decision not to contest what,\naccording to the Court, was an unprecedented infringe\nment on the agency\u2019s statutory authority.\n  To be sure, the District Court\u2019s judgment is somewhat\nopaque. But it is troubling that we may be asserting\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

It is also trou\nbling that we may be making law without adequate brief\ning on the critical questions we are passing upon. I would\nnot be surprised if on remand the District Court merely\nclarified its order.\n                              III\n   Even assuming that the majority has correctly inter\npreted the District Court\u2019s judgment, I do not agree that\nwe should reverse the District Court.\n   At the outset, it is important to observe that when a\ndistrict court is faced with an unlawful agency action, a\nset of parties who have relied on that action, and a prayer\nfor relief to avoid irreparable harm, the court is operating\nunder its powers of equity. In such a case, a court\u2019s func\ntion is \u201cto do equity and to mould each decree to the neces\nsities of the particular case.\u201d Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321\nU. S. 321, 329 (1944). \u201cFlexibility\u201d and \u201cpracticality\u201d are\nthe touchtones of these remedial determinations, as \u201cthe\npublic interest,\u201d \u201cprivate needs,\u201d and \u201ccompeting private\nclaims\u201d must all be weighed and reconciled against the\nbackground of the court\u2019s own limitations and its particu\nlar familiarity with the case.

The\nparties to this appeal and the majority assume that the District Court\u2019s\nremedy was crafted under its equity powers, and I will do the same.\n  6 One of the many matters not briefed in this case is how limited a\n\npartial deregulation can be. It is not clear whether the sort of ex\ntremely limited \u201cpartial deregulations\u201d envisioned by the Court, see\nante, at 19\u201323, in which RRA is \u201cderegulated\u201d in one small geographic\narea pursuant to stringent restrictions, could be achieved only through\n\u201cpartial deregulation\u201d actions, or whether they could also (or exclu\nsively) be achieved through a more case-specific permit process. Under\nthe applicable regulations, a regulated article may still be used subject\nto a permitting process. See 7 CFR \u00a7\u00a7340.0, 340.4 (2010).

Indeed, it appears that any de\nregulation of a genetically modified, herbicide-resistant\ncrop that can transfer its genes to other organisms and\ncannot effectively be monitored easily fits the criteria for\nwhen an EIS is required.7 That is especially so when, as\nin this case, the environmental threat is novel.

In 2007, APHIS began contemplating a \u201cnew system\u201d to\nallow for the release and use of genetically modified organisms, for\n\u201cspecial cases\u201d in which there are risks \u201cthat could be mitigated with\nconditions to ensure safe commercial use.\u201d Introduction 39024 (em\nphasis added).\n   7 See, e.g., 40 CFR \u00a71508.8 (2009) (determination whether an EIS is\n\nrequired turns on both \u201c[d]irect effects\u201d and \u201c[i]ndirect effects,\u201d and\n\u201cinclude[s] those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial\nand detrimental effects even if on balance the agency believes that the\neffect will be beneficial\u201d); \u00a71508.27(b)(4) (determination whether an EIS\nis required turns on \u201c[t]he degree to which the effects on the quality of\nthe human environment are likely to be highly controversial\u201d);\n\u00a71508.27(b)(5) (determination whether an EIS is required turns on\n\u201c[t]he degree to which the possible effects on the quality of the human\nenvironment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown\nrisks\u201d).\n   8 The Court posits a hypothetical in which APHIS deregulates RRA\n\nlimited to a remote area in which alfalfa is not grown, and issues an\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

Courts con\nfronted with NEPA violations regularly adopt interim\nmeasures to maintain the status quo, particularly if allow\ning agency action to go forward risks foreclosing alterna\ntive courses of action that the agency might have adopted\nfollowing completion of an EIS. See D. Mandelker, NEPA\nLaw and Litigation \u00a74:61. The applicable regulations, to\nwhich the District Court owed deference,9 provide that\nduring the preparation of an EIS, \u201cno action concerning\nthe [agency\u2019s] proposal shall be taken which would . . .\n[h]ave an adverse environmental impact\u201d or \u201c[l]imit the\nchoice of reasonable alternatives.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a71506.1(a)\n(2009). As exemplified by the problem of what to do with\nfarmers who had already purchased or planted RRA prior\nto the District Court\u2019s judgment, even minimal deregula\ntion can limit future regulatory options. \u201cCourts must\nremember that in many cases allowing an agency to pro\nceed makes a mockery of the EIS process, converting it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\naccompanying order \u201cmandating isolation distances so great as to\neliminate any appreciable risk of gene flow to the crops of conventional\nfarmers who might someday choose to plant in the surrounding area.\u201d\nAnte, at 21. At the outset, it is important to note the difference be\ntween a plausible hypothetical and a piece of fiction. At least as of\n2007, APHIS had never granted partial approval of a petition for\nnonregulated status. See n. 6, supra. And I doubt that it would choose\nto deregulate genetically modified alfalfa in a place where the growing\nconditions and sales networks for the product are so poor that no\nfarmer already plants it. Moreover, the notion that this imagined\nderegulation would pose virtually no environmental risk ignores one of\nthe District Court\u2019s critical findings of fact: APHIS has very limited\ncapacity to monitor its own restrictions. The agency could place all\nmanner of constraints on its deregulation orders; they will have no\neffect unless they are enforced.\n   9 See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 372\n\n(1989).\n14         MONSANTO CO. v.

See\nante, at 20.10 I do not see the \u201cinconsisten[cy].\u201d Ibid.\nNEPA does not apply to actions by federal courts. See 40\nCFR \u00a71508.12. Exercising its equitable discretion to\nbalance the interests of the parties and the public, the\nDistrict Court would have been well within its rights to\nfind that NEPA requires an EIS before the agency grants\n\u201cMonsanto\u2019s deregulation petition, even in part,\u201d App. to\nPet. for Cert. 108a, yet also to find that a partial stay of\nthe vacatur was appropriate to protect the interests of\nthose farmers who had already acted in good-faith reliance\non APHIS.\n   Similarly, I do not agree that the District Court\u2019s ruling\nwas \u201cpremature\u201d because APHIS had not yet effected any\npartial deregulations, ante, at 19. Although it is \u201cfor the\nagency to decide whether and to what extent\u201d it will pur\nsue deregulation, ante, at 17, the court\u2019s application of\nNEPA to APHIS\u2019s regulation of RRA might have con\ntrolled any deregulation during the pendency of the EIS.\nPetitioners and APHIS had already come back to the court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The Court states that the order permitted both harvesting and\n\nplanting. But the court\u2019s final judgment permitted only sale and\nharvesting of RRA planted before March 30, 2007, more than a month\nbefore the judgment.

That same concern\nwould apply to any partial deregulation order. The court\ntherefore had good reason to make it clear, upfront, that\nthe parties should not continue to expend resources pro\nposing such orders, instead of just moving ahead with an\nEIS. Cf. Railroad Comm\u2019n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312\nU. S. 496, 500 (1941) (\u201cThe resources of equity are equal to\nan adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative\ndecision\u201d).

Ante, at 18.\nInjunctive Relief\n   Second, the District Court\u2019s judgment can be understood\nas a reasonable response to the nature of the risks posed\nby RRA. Separate and apart from NEPA\u2019s requirement of\nan EIS, these risks were sufficiently serious, in my view,\nthat the court\u2019s injunction was a permissible exercise of its\nequitable authority.\n   The District Court found that gene transfer can and\ndoes occur, and that if it were to spread through open land\nthe environmental and economic consequences would be\ndevastating. Cf. Amoco Production Co. v. Gambell, 480\nU. S. 531, 545 (1987) (\u201cEnvironmental injury, by its na\nture, can seldom be adequately remedied by money dam\nages and is often permanent or at least of long duration,\ni.e., irreparable\u201d).

S. __, __ (2010) (per curiam) (slip op., at 12).\n   Additional considerations support the District Court\u2019s\njudgment. It was clear to the court that APHIS had only\nlimited capacity to monitor planted RRA, and some RRA\nhad already been planted. The marginal threat posed by\nadditional planting was therefore significant. Injunctive\nremedies are meant to achieve a \u201cnice adjustment and\nreconciliation between the competing claims\u201d of injury by\n\u201cmould[ing] each decree to the necessities of the case.\u201d\nWeinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U. S. 305, 312 (1982)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under these circum\nstances, it was not unreasonable for the court to conclude\nthat the most equitable solution was to allocate the lim\nited amount of potentially safe RRA to the farmers who\nhad already planted that crop.11\n   The Court suggests that the injunction was nonetheless\ntoo sweeping because \u201ca partial deregulation need not\ncause respondents any injury at all . . . if the scope of the\npartial deregulation is sufficiently limited, the risk of gene\nflow to their crops could be virtually nonexistent.\u201d Ante, at\n21. The Court appears to reach this conclusion by citing\none particular study (in a voluminous record), rather than\nany findings of fact.12 Even assuming that this study is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 As explained previously, I do not see the court\u2019s broad injunction as\n\n\u201cinconsistent,\u201d ante, at 20, with its decision that farmers who had\nalready planted RRA could harvest their crop. The equities are differ\nent for farmers who relied on the agency than for companies like\nMonstanto that developed an organism knowing it might be regulated;\nand APHIS could monitor only a limited amount of RRA.\n  12 The Court also hypothesizes a set of growing conditions that would\n\nisolate RRA from the plaintiffs in this case, even if not from other\nfarmers. See ante, at 21\u201322. As already explained, these hypotheticals\nare rather unrealistic. See n. 8, supra. And, given that the plaintiffs\ninclude environmental organizations as well as farmer and consumer\nassociations, it is hard to see how APHIS could so carefully isolate and\nprotect their interests. In any event, because APHIS concedes that it\n                     Cite as: 561 U.

APHIS and petitioners argued to the\nDistrict Court that partial deregulation could be safely\nimplemented, they submitted evidence intended to show\nthat planting restrictions would prevent the spread of the\nnewly engineered gene, and they contested \u201cvirtually\nevery factual issue relating to possible environmental\nharm.\u201d Geertson Seed Farms v. Johanns, 570 F. 3d 1130,\n1135 (CA9 2009). But lacking \u201cthe benefit of the develop\nment of all the relevant data,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a,\nthe District Court did not find APHIS\u2019s and petitioners\u2019\nassertions to be convincing. I cannot say that I would\nhave found otherwise. It was reasonable for the court to\nconclude that planting could not go forward until more\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncannot monitor such limits, rules that protect these or any other parties\nmay be merely hortatory in practice. Moreover, although we have not\nsquarely addressed the issue, in my view \u201c[t]here is no general re\nquirement that an injunction affect only the parties in the suit.\u201d\nBresgal v.

See ante, at 22, n. 6. Quite right.

A court\u2019s\nequitable discretion must be guided by \u201crecognized, de\nfined public policy.\u201d Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320 U. S.\n228, 235 (1943); see also Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.

Congress recognized in\nNEPA that complex environmental cases often require\nexceptionally sophisticated scientific determinations, and\nthat agency decisions should not be made on the basis of\n\u201cincomplete information.\u201d Marsh v. Oregon Natural Re\nsources Council, 490 U. S. 360, 371 (1989). Congress also\nrecognized that agencies cannot fully weigh the conse\nquences of these decisions without obtaining public com\nments through an EIS. See Robertson v. Methow Valley\nCitizens Council, 490 U. S. 332, 350 (1989).15 While a\ncourt may not presume that a NEPA violation requires an\ninjunction, it may take into account the principles embod\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 I suspect that if APHIS and petitioners had come back to the court\n\nwith more convincing evidence prior to completing an EIS, and moved\nto modify the court\u2019s order, the court would have done so. Indeed, the\nDistrict Court showed a willingness to recalibrate its order when it\namended its judgment just a few months after the judgment\u2019s issuance\nin light of APHIS\u2019s submission that certain requirements were imprac\ntical. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a\u2013114a.\n   15 Accordingly, while \u201cNEPA itself does not mandate particular re\n\nsults,\u201d it does mandate a particular process and embodies the principle\nthat federal agencies should \u201ccarefully conside[r] detailed information\u201d\nbefore incurring potential environmental harm.

This District Court had before it\nstrong evidence that gene transmission was likely to occur\nand that limits on growing could not be enforced. It also\nhad a large amount of highly detailed evidence about\nwhether growing restrictions, even if enforced, can prevent\ntransmission. That evidence called into question the\nagency\u2019s own claims regarding the risks posed by partial\nderegulation. In enjoining partial deregulation until it\nhad the benefit of an EIS to help parse the evidence, the\ncourt acted with exactly the sort of caution that Congress\nendorsed in NEPA.\n   Finally, it bears mention that the District Court\u2019s ex\nperience with the case may have given it grounds for\nskepticism about the representations made by APHIS and\npetitioners.

GEERTSON SEED FARMS\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nAmerican business, and that limits on RRA deregulation\nmight not be followed or enforced\u2014and that even if they\nwere, the newly engineered gene might nevertheless\nspread to other crops. Confronted with those disconcert\ning submissions, with APHIS\u2019s unlawful deregulation\ndecision, with a group of farmers who had staked their\nlivelihoods on APHIS\u2019s decision, and with a federal statute\nthat prizes informed decisionmaking on matters that\nseriously affect the environment, the court did the best it\ncould. In my view, the District Court was well within its\ndiscretion to order the remedy that the Court now re\nverses. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
