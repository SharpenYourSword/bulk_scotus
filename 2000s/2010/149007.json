JACKSON\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 09\u2013497.      Argued April 26, 2010\u2014Decided June 21, 2010\nRespondent Jackson filed an employment-discrimination suit against\n  petitioner Rent-A-Center, his former employer, in a Nevada Federal\n  District Court. Rent-A-Center filed a motion, under the Federal Ar\n  bitration Act (FAA), to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S. C. \u00a73,\n  and to compel arbitration, \u00a74, based on the arbitration agreement\n  (Agreement) Jackson signed as a condition of his employment. Jack\n  son opposed the motion on the ground that the Agreement was unen\n  forceable in that it was unconscionable under Nevada law. The Dis\n  trict Court granted Rent-A-Center\u2019s motion. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed in relevant part.\nHeld: Under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an\n agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the\n agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that\n particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if\n a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the\n challenge is for the arbitrator. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) Section 2 of the FAA places arbitration agreements on an equal\n footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.\n Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440, 443, and requires courts to enforce them ac\n cording to their terms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of\n Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478, \u201csave\n upon such grounds as exist under law or in equity for the revocation\n of any contract,\u201d \u00a72. Here, the Agreement included two relevant arbi\n tration provisions: it provided for arbitration of all disputes arising\n out of Jackson\u2019s employment, including discrimination claims, and it\n gave the \u201cArbitrator . . . exclusive authority to resolve any dispute re\n lating to the [Agreement\u2019s] enforceability . . . including . . . any claim\n2              RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\u201d Rent-A-\n    Center seeks enforcement of the second provision, which delegates to\n    the arbitrator the \u201cgateway\u201d question of enforceability. See, e.g.,\n    Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83\u201385. The\n    court must enforce the delegation provision under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 unless it\n    is unenforceable under \u00a72. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) There are two types of validity challenges under \u00a72: one \u201cchal\n    lenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate,\u201d and\n    \u201c[t]he other challenges the contract as a whole,\u201d Buckeye, supra, at\n    444. Only the first is relevant to a court\u2019s determination of an arbi\n    tration agreement\u2019s enforceability, see, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v.\n    Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403\u2013404, because under \u00a72\n    \u201can arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the con\n    tract,\u201d Buckeye, supra, at 445. That does not mean that agreements\n    to arbitrate are unassailable. If a party challenges the validity under\n    \u00a72 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court\n    must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with the\n    agreement under \u00a74. That is no less true when the precise agree\n    ment to arbitrate is itself part of a larger arbitration agreement. Be\n    cause here the agreement to arbitrate enforceability (the delegation\n    provision) is severable from the remainder of the Agreement, unless\n    Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, it must be\n    treated as valid under \u00a72 and enforced under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (c) The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged\n    only the validity of the contract as a whole. In his brief to this Court\n    he raised a challenge to the delegation provision for the first time,\n    but that is too late and will not be considered. See 14 Penn Plaza\n    LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.

S. C. \u00a7\u00a71\u201316, a district court may decide\na claim that an arbitration agreement is unconscionable,\nwhere the agreement explicitly assigns that decision to the\narbitrator.\n                              I\n   On February 1, 2007, the respondent here, Antonio\nJackson, filed an employment-discrimination suit under\nRev. Stat. \u00a71977, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71981, against his former\nemployer in the United States District Court for the Dis\ntrict of Nevada. The defendant and petitioner here, Rent-\nA-Center, West, Inc., filed a motion under the FAA to\ndismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S. C. \u00a73, and to com\npel arbitration, \u00a74. Rent-A-Center argued that the Mutual\nAgreement to Arbitrate Claims (Agreement), which Jack\nson signed on February 24, 2003 as a condition of his\nemployment there, precluded Jackson from pursuing his\nclaims in court. The Agreement provided for arbitration of\nall \u201cpast, present or future\u201d disputes arising out of Jack\nson\u2019s employment with Rent-A-Center, including \u201cclaims\n2         RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor discrimination\u201d and \u201cclaims for violation of any federal\n. . . law.\u201d App. 29\u201330. It also provided that \u201c[t]he Arbitra\ntor, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,\nshall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute\nrelating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability\nor formation of this Agreement including, but not limited\nto any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void\nor voidable.\u201d Id., at 34.\n   Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that \u201cthe\narbitration agreement in question is clearly unenforceable\nin that it is unconscionable\u201d under Nevada law. Id., at 40.\nRent-A-Center responded that Jackson\u2019s unconscionability\nclaim was not properly before the court because Jackson\nhad expressly agreed that the arbitrator would have ex\nclusive authority to resolve any dispute about the enforce\nability of the Agreement. It also disputed the merits of\nJackson\u2019s unconscionability claims.\n   The District Court granted Rent-A-Center\u2019s motion to\ndismiss the proceedings and to compel arbitration. The\ncourt found that the Agreement \u201c \u2018 \u201cclearly and unmistak\nenly [sic]\u201d \u2019 \u201d gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to\ndecide whether the Agreement is enforceable, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 4a. (quoting Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,\nInc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002)), and, because Jackson chal\nlenged the validity of the Agreement as a whole, the issue\nwas for the arbitrator, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a (citing\nBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,\n444\u2013445 (2006)). The court noted that even if it were to\nexamine the merits of Jackson\u2019s unconscionability claims,\nit would have rejected the claim that the agreement to\nsplit arbitration fees was substantively unconscionable\nunder Nevada law. It did not address Jackson\u2019s proce\ndural or other substantive unconscionability arguments.\n   Without oral argument, a divided panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, affirmed in\npart, and remanded. 581 F. 3d 912 (2009). The court\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreversed on the question of who (the court or arbitrator)\nhad the authority to decide whether the Agreement is\nenforceable. It noted that \u201cJackson does not dispute that\nthe language of the Agreement clearly assigns the arbitra\nbility determination to the arbitrator,\u201d but held that where\n\u201ca party challenges an arbitration agreement as uncon\nscionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully\nassent to the agreement, the threshold question of uncon\nscionability is for the court.\u201d Id., at 917. The Ninth Cir\ncuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s alternative conclusion\nthat the fee-sharing provision was not substantively un\nconscionable and remanded for consideration of Jackson\u2019s\nother unconscionability arguments. Id., at 919\u2013920, and\nn. 3. Judge Hall dissented on the ground that \u201cthe ques\ntion of the arbitration agreement\u2019s validity should have\ngone to the arbitrator, as the parties \u2018clearly and unmis\ntakably provide[d]\u2019 in their agreement.\u201d Id., at 921.\n   We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbi\ntration is a matter of contract. Section 2, the \u201cprimary\nsubstantive provision of the Act,\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial\nHospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983),\nprovides:\n       \u201cA written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a\n    transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitra\n    tion a controversy thereafter arising out of such con\n    tract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\n    save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for\n    the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72.\nThe FAA thereby places arbitration agreements on an\nequal footing with other contracts, Buckeye, supra, at 443,\nand requires courts to enforce them according to their\n4         RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nterms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees\nof Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478\n(1989). Like other contracts, however, they may be invali\ndated by \u201cgenerally applicable contract defenses, such as\nfraud, duress, or unconscionability.\u201d Doctor\u2019s Associates,\nInc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996).\n   The Act also establishes procedures by which federal\ncourts implement \u00a72\u2019s substantive rule. Under \u00a73, a party\nmay apply to a federal court for a stay of the trial of an\naction \u201cupon any issue referable to arbitration under an\nagreement in writing for such arbitration.\u201d Under \u00a74, a\nparty \u201caggrieved\u201d by the failure of another party \u201cto arbi\ntrate under a written agreement for arbitration\u201d may\npetition a federal court \u201cfor an order directing that such\narbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such\nagreement.\u201d The court \u201cshall\u201d order arbitration \u201cupon\nbeing satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbi\ntration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue.\u201d\nIbid.\n   The Agreement here contains multiple \u201cwritten provi\nsion[s]\u201d to \u201csettle by arbitration a controversy,\u201d \u00a72. Two\nare relevant to our discussion. First, the section titled\n\u201cClaims Covered By The Agreement\u201d provides for arbitra\ntion of all \u201cpast, present or future\u201d disputes arising out of\nJackson\u2019s employment with Rent-A-Center. App. 29.\nSecond, the section titled \u201cArbitration Procedures\u201d pro\nvides that \u201c[t]he Arbitrator . . . shall have exclusive au\nthority to resolve any dispute relating to the . . . enforce\nability . . . of this Agreement including, but not limited to\nany claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or\nvoidable.\u201d Id., at 32, 34. The current \u201ccontroversy\u201d be\ntween the parties is whether the Agreement is uncon\nscionable. It is the second provision, which delegates\nresolution of that controversy to the arbitrator, that Rent-\nA-Center seeks to enforce. Adopting the terminology used\nby the parties, we will refer to it as the delegation provi\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsion.\n  The delegation provision is an agreement to arbitrate\nthreshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement.\nWe have recognized that parties can agree to arbitrate\n\u201cgateway\u201d questions of \u201carbitrability,\u201d such as whether the\nparties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agree\nment covers a particular controversy. See, e.g., Howsam,\n537 U. S., at 83\u201385; Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,\n539 U. S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion). This line of\ncases merely reflects the principle that arbitration is a\nmatter of contract.1 See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 There is one caveat. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514\n\nU. S. 938, 944 (1995), held that \u201c[c]ourts should not assume that the\nparties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is \u2018clea[r] and\nunmistakabl[e]\u2019 evidence that they did so.\u201d The parties agree the\nheightened standard applies here. See Brief for Petitioner 21; Brief for\nRespondent 54. The District Court concluded the \u201cAgreement to\nArbitrate clearly and unmistakenly [sic] provides the arbitrator with\nthe exclusive authority to decide whether the Agreement to Arbitrate is\nenforceable.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The Ninth Circuit noted that\nJackson did not dispute that the text of the Agreement was clear and\nunmistakable on this point. 581 F. 3d 912, 917 (2009). He also does\nnot dispute it here. What he argues now, however, is that it is not\n\u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d that his agreement to that text was valid,\nbecause of the unconscionability claims he raises. See Brief for Re\nspondent 54\u201355. The dissent makes the same argument. See post, at\n5\u20138 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).\n   This mistakes the subject of the First Options \u201cclear and unmistak\nable\u201d requirement. It pertains to the parties\u2019 manifestation of intent,\nnot the agreement\u2019s validity. As explained in Howsam v. Dean Witter\nReynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002), it is an \u201cinterpretive rule,\u201d based\non an assumption about the parties\u2019 expectations. In \u201ccircumstance[s]\nwhere contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have\ndecided the gateway matter,\u201d ibid., we assume that is what they agreed\nto. Thus, \u201c[u]nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide\notherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to\nbe decided by the court, not the arbitrator.\u201d AT&T Technologies, Inc. v.\nCommunications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986).\n   The validity of a written agreement to arbitrate (whether it is legally\nbinding, as opposed to whether it was in fact agreed to\u2014including, of\n6           RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nKaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 943 (1995). An agreement to arbi\ntrate a gateway issue is simply an additional, antecedent\nagreement the party seeking arbitration asks the federal\ncourt to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional\narbitration agreement just as it does on any other. The\nadditional agreement is valid under \u00a72 \u201csave upon such\ngrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of\nany contract,\u201d and federal courts can enforce the agree\nment by staying federal litigation under \u00a73 and compelling\narbitration under \u00a74. The question before us, then, is\nwhether the delegation provision is valid under \u00a72.\n                             B\n   There are two types of validity challenges under \u00a72:\n\u201cOne type challenges specifically the validity of the\nagreement to arbitrate,\u201d and \u201c[t]he other challenges the\ncontract as a whole, either on a ground that directly af\nfects the entire agreement (e.g., the agreement was\nfraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality\nof one of the contract\u2019s provisions renders the whole con\ntract invalid.\u201d Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444. In a line of\ncases neither party has asked us to overrule, we held that\nonly the first type of challenge is relevant to a court\u2019s\ndetermination whether the arbitration agreement at issue\nis enforceable.2 See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin\nMfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403\u2013404 (1967); Buckeye, supra, at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourse, whether it was void for unconscionability) is governed by \u00a72\u2019s\nprovision that it shall be valid \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law\nor equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d Those grounds do not\ninclude, of course, any requirement that its lack of unconscionability\nmust be \u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d And they are not grounds that First\nOptions added for agreements to arbitrate gateway issues; \u00a72 applies to\nall written agreements to arbitrate.\n  2 The issue of the agreement\u2019s \u201cvalidity\u201d is different from the issue\n\nwhether any agreement between the parties \u201cwas ever concluded,\u201d and,\nas in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440 (2006),\nwe address only the former. Id., at 444, n. 1.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n444\u2013446; Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 353\u2013354 (2008).\nThat is because \u00a72 states that a \u201cwritten provision\u201d \u201cto\nsettle by arbitration a controversy\u201d is \u201cvalid, irrevocable,\nand enforceable\u201d without mention of the validity of the\ncontract in which it is contained. Thus, a party\u2019s chal\nlenge to another provision of the contract, or to the con\ntract as a whole, does not prevent a court from enforcing a\nspecific agreement to arbitrate. \u201c[A]s a matter of substan\ntive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is\nseverable from the remainder of the contract.\u201d Buckeye,\n546 U. S., at 445; see also id., at 447 (the severability rule\nis based on \u00a72).\n   But that agreements to arbitrate are severable does not\nmean that they are unassailable. If a party challenges the\nvalidity under \u00a72 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at\nissue, the federal court must consider the challenge before\nordering compliance with that agreement under \u00a74. In\nPrima Paint, for example, if the claim had been \u201cfraud in\nthe inducement of the arbitration clause itself,\u201d then the\ncourt would have considered it. 388 U. S., at 403\u2013404.\n\u201cTo immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial\nchallenge on the ground of fraud in the inducement would\nbe to elevate it over other forms of contract,\u201d id., at 404,\nn. 12. In some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the\ncontract as a whole will be much easier to establish than\nthe same basis as applied only to the severable agreement\nto arbitrate. Thus, in an employment contract many\nelements of alleged unconscionability applicable to the\nentire contract (outrageously low wages, for example)\nwould not affect the agreement to arbitrate alone. But\neven where that is not the case\u2014as in Prima Paint itself,\nwhere the alleged fraud that induced the whole contract\nequally induced the agreement to arbitrate which was part\nof that contract\u2014we nonetheless require the basis of\nchallenge to be directed specifically to the agreement to\narbitrate before the court will intervene.\n8            RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Here, the \u201cwritten provision . . . to settle by arbitration a\ncontroversy,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72, that Rent-A-Center asks us to\nenforce is the delegation provision\u2014the provision that\ngave the arbitrator \u201cexclusive authority to resolve any\ndispute relating to the . . . enforceability . . . of this\nAgreement,\u201d App. 34. The \u201cremainder of the contract,\u201d\nBuckeye, supra, at 445, is the rest of the agreement to\narbitrate claims arising out of Jackson\u2019s employment with\nRent-A-Center. To be sure this case differs from Prima\nPaint, Buckeye, and Preston, in that the arbitration provi\nsions sought to be enforced in those cases were contained\nin contracts unrelated to arbitration\u2014contracts for con\nsulting services, see Prima Paint, supra, at 397, check\ncashing services, see Buckeye, supra, at 442, and \u201cpersonal\nmanagement\u201d or \u201ctalent agent\u201d services, see Preston,\nsupra, at 352. In this case, the underlying contract is\nitself an arbitration agreement. But that makes no differ\nence.3 Application of the severability rule does not depend\non the substance of the remainder of the contract. Section\n2 operates on the specific \u201cwritten provision\u201d to \u201csettle by\narbitration a controversy\u201d that the party seeks to enforce.\nAccordingly, unless Jackson challenged the delegation\nprovision specifically, we must treat it as valid under \u00a72,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The\n        dissent calls this a \u201cbreezy assertion,\u201d post, at 1, but it seems to\nus self-evident. When the dissent comes to discussing the point, post,\nat 11, it gives no logical reason why an agreement to arbitrate one\ncontroversy (an employment-discrimination claim) is not severable from\nan agreement to arbitrate a different controversy (enforceability).\nThere is none. Since the dissent accepts that the invalidity of one\nprovision within an arbitration agreement does not necessarily invali\ndate its other provisions, post, at 7, n. 7, it cannot believe in some sort\nof magic bond between arbitration provisions that prevents them from\nbeing severed from each other. According to the dissent, it is fine to\nsever an invalid provision within an arbitration agreement when\nseverability is a matter of state law, but severability is not allowed\nwhen it comes to applying Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg.\nCo., 388 U. S. 395 (1967).\n                 Cite as: 561 U.

See App. 39\u201347. Rent-A-Center noted this fact\nin its reply: \u201c[Jackson\u2019s response] fails to rebut or other\nwise address in any way [Rent-A-Center\u2019s] argument that\nthe Arbitrator must decide [Jackson\u2019s] challenge to\nthe enforceability of the Agreement. Thus, [Rent-A-\nCenter\u2019s] argument is uncontested.\u201d Id., at 50 (emphasis in\noriginal).\n   The arguments Jackson made in his response to Rent-A-\nCenter\u2019s motion to compel arbitration support this conclu\nsion. Jackson stated that \u201cthe entire agreement seems\ndrawn to provide [Rent-A-Center] with undue advantages\nshould an employment-related dispute arise.\u201d Id., at 44\n(emphasis added). At one point, he argued that the limita\ntions on discovery \u201cfurther suppor[t] [his] contention that\nthe arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively\nunconscionable.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). And before this\nCourt, Jackson describes his challenge in the District\nCourt as follows: He \u201copposed the motion to compel on the\nground that the entire arbitration agreement, including the\ndelegation clause, was unconscionable.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 55 (emphasis added). That is an accurate description\nof his filings.\n   As required to make out a claim of unconscionability\nunder Nevada law, see 581 F. 3d, at 919, he contended\nthat the Agreement was both procedurally and substan\ntively unconscionable. It was procedurally unconscion\nable, he argued, because it \u201cwas imposed as a condition of\n10        RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nemployment and was non-negotiable.\u201d App. 41. But we\nneed not consider that claim because none of Jackson\u2019s\nsubstantive unconscionability challenges was specific to\nthe delegation provision. First, he argued that the Agree\nment\u2019s coverage was one sided in that it required arbitra\ntion of claims an employee was likely to bring\u2014contract,\ntort, discrimination, and statutory claims\u2014but did not\nrequire arbitration of claims Rent-A-Center was likely to\nbring\u2014intellectual property, unfair competition, and trade\nsecrets claims. Id., at 42\u201343. This one-sided-coverage\nargument clearly did not go to the validity of the delega\ntion provision.\n   Jackson\u2019s other two substantive unconscionability ar\nguments assailed arbitration procedures called for by the\ncontract\u2014the fee-splitting arrangement and the limita\ntions on discovery\u2014procedures that were to be used dur\ning arbitration under both the agreement to arbitrate\nemployment-related disputes and the delegation provision.\nIt may be that had Jackson challenged the delegation\nprovision by arguing that these common procedures as\napplied to the delegation provision rendered that provision\nunconscionable, the challenge should have been consid\nered by the court. To make such a claim based on the\ndiscovery procedures, Jackson would have had to argue\nthat the limitation upon the number of depositions causes\nthe arbitration of his claim that the Agreement is unen\nforceable to be unconscionable. That would be, of course, a\nmuch more difficult argument to sustain than the argu\nment that the same limitation renders arbitration of his\nfactbound employment-discrimination claim unconscion\nable. Likewise, the unfairness of the fee-splitting ar\nrangement may be more difficult to establish for the arbi\ntration of enforceability than for arbitration of more\ncomplex and fact-related aspects of the alleged employ\nment discrimination. Jackson, however, did not make any\narguments specific to the delegation provision; he argued\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the fee-sharing and discovery procedures rendered\nthe entire Agreement invalid.\n    Jackson\u2019s appeal to the Ninth Circuit confirms that he\ndid not contest the validity of the delegation provision in\nparticular. His brief noted the existence of the delegation\nprovision, Brief for Appellant in No. 07\u201316164, p. 3, but\nhis unconscionability arguments made no mention of it,\nid., at 3\u20137. He also repeated the arguments he had made\nbefore the District Court, see supra, at 9, that the \u201centire\nagreement\u201d favors Rent-A-Center and that the limitations\non discovery further his \u201ccontention that the arbitration\nagreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable,\u201d\nBrief for Appellant 7\u20138. Finally, he repeated the argu\nment made in his District Court filings, that under state\nlaw the unconscionable clauses could not be severed from\nthe arbitration agreement, see id., at 8\u20139.4 The point of\nthis argument, of course, is that the Agreement as a whole\nis unconscionable under state law.\n    Jackson repeated that argument before this Court. At\noral argument, counsel stated: \u201cThere are certain elements\nof the arbitration agreement that are unconscionable and,\nunder Nevada law, which would render the entire arbitra\ntion agreement unconscionable.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (em\nphasis added). And again, he stated, \u201cwe\u2019ve got both\ncertain provisions that are unconscionable, that under\nNevada law render the entire agreement unconscionable\n. . . , and that\u2019s what the Court is to rely on.\u201d Id., at 43\u201344\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Jackson\u2019s argument fails. The severability rule is a \u201cmatter of sub\n\nstantive federal arbitration law,\u201d and we have repeatedly \u201crejected the\nview that the question of \u2018severability\u2019 was one of state law, so that if\nstate law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge\nto the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.\u201d Buckeye, 546\nU.

We have treated this hold\ning as a severability rule: When a party challenges a\ncontract, \u201cbut not specifically its arbitration provisions,\nthose provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder\nof the contract.\u201d       Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.\nCardegna, 546 U.

Its breezy assertion that\nthe subject matter of the contract at issue\u2014in this case, an\narbitration agreement and nothing more\u2014\u201cmakes no\ndifference,\u201d ante, at 7, is simply wrong.

JACKSON\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\narbitration agreement is but one part of a broader em\nployment agreement between the parties, just as the\narbitration clause in Prima Paint was but one part of a\nbroader contract for services between those parties. Thus,\nthat the subject matter of the agreement is exclusively\narbitration makes all the difference in the Prima Paint\nanalysis.\n                             I\n   Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71\u201316, parties generally have substantial leeway to\ndefine the terms and scope of their agreement to settle\ndisputes in an arbitral forum. \u201c[A]rbitration is,\u201d after all,\n\u201csimply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a\nway to resolve those disputes\u2014but only those disputes\u2014\nthat the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\u201d\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,\n943 (1995). The FAA, therefore, envisions a limited role\nfor courts asked to stay litigation and refer disputes to\narbitration.\n   Certain issues\u2014the kind that \u201ccontracting parties would\nlikely have expected a court to have decided\u201d\u2014remain\nwithin the province of judicial review.

S., at 947.\n   \u201c[Q]uestion[s] of arbitrability\u201d thus include questions\nregarding the existence of a legally binding and valid\narbitration agreement, as well as questions regarding the\nscope of a concededly binding arbitration agreement. In\nthis case we are concerned with the first of these catego\nries: whether the parties have a valid arbitration agree\nment. This is an issue the FAA assigns to the courts.2\nSection 2 of the FAA dictates that covered arbitration\nagreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\nsave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72. \u201c[S]uch\ngrounds,\u201d which relate to contract validity and formation,\ninclude the claim at issue in this case, unconscionability.\nSee Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681,\n687 (1996).\n   Two different lines of cases bear on the issue of who\ndecides a question of arbitrability respecting validity, such\nas whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable.\nAlthough this issue, as a gateway matter, is typically for\nthe court, we have explained that such an issue can be\ndelegated to the arbitrator in some circumstances. When\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although it is not clear from our precedents, I understand \u201cgateway\n\nmatters\u201d and \u201cquestions of arbitrability\u201d to be roughly synonymous, if\nnot exactly so. At the very least, the former includes all of the latter.\n  2 Gateway issues involving the scope of an otherwise valid arbitration\n\nagreement also have a statutory origin. Section 3 of the FAA provides\nthat \u201cupon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit . . . is\nreferable to arbitration under such an agreement,\u201d a court \u201cshall . . .\nstay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had.\u201d 9\nU. S. C. \u00a73.\n4            RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe parties have purportedly done so, courts must examine\ntwo distinct rules to decide whether the delegation is\nvalid.\n   The first line of cases looks to the parties\u2019 intent. In\nAT&T Technologies, we stated that \u201cquestion[s] of arbi\ntrability\u201d may be delegated to the arbitrator, so long as the\ndelegation is clear and unmistakable. 475 U. S., at 649.\nWe reaffirmed this rule, and added some nuance, in First\nOptions. Against the background presumption that ques\ntions of arbitrability go to the court, we stated that federal\ncourts should \u201cgenerally\u201d apply \u201cordinary state-law princi\nples that govern the formation of contracts\u201d to assess\n\u201cwhether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter\n(including arbitrability).\u201d 514 U. S., at 944. But, we\nadded, a more rigorous standard applies when the inquiry\nis whether the parties have \u201cagreed to arbitrate arbitrabil\nity\u201d: \u201cCourts should not assume that the parties agreed to\narbitrate arbitrability unless there is clear and unmistak\nable evidence that they did so.\u201d3 Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s unani\nmous opinion for the Court described this standard as a\ntype of \u201crevers[e]\u201d \u201cpresumption\u201d4\u2014one in favor of a judi\ncial, rather than an arbitral, forum. Id., at 945. Clear and\nunmistakable \u201cevidence\u201d of agreement to arbitrate arbi\ntrability might include, as was urged in First Options, a\ncourse of conduct demonstrating assent,5 id., at 946, or, as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 We  have not expressly decided whether the First Options delegation\nprinciple would apply to questions of arbitrability that implicate \u00a72\nconcerns, i.e., grounds for contract revocation. I do not need to weigh in\non this issue in order to resolve the present case.\n   4 It is a \u201crevers[e]\u201d presumption because it is counter to the presump\n\ntion we usually apply in favor of arbitration when the question con\ncerns whether a particular dispute falls within the scope of a conced\nedly binding arbitration agreement. First Options, 514 U. S., at 944\u2013\n945.\n   5 In First Options we found no clear and unmistakable assent to dele\n\ngate to the arbitrator questions of arbitrability, given the parties\u2019\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  5\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nis urged in this case, an express agreement to do so. In\nany event, whether such evidence exists is a matter for the\ncourt to determine.\n   The second line of cases bearing on who decides the\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement, as the Court ex\nplains, involves the Prima Paint rule. See ante, at 6. That\nrule recognizes two types of validity challenges. One type\nchallenges the validity of the arbitration agreement itself,\non a ground arising from an infirmity in that agreement.\nThe other challenges the validity of the arbitration agree\nment tangentially\u2014via a claim that the entire contract (of\nwhich the arbitration agreement is but a part) is invalid\nfor some reason. See Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444. Under\nPrima Paint, a challenge of the first type goes to the court;\na challenge of the second type goes to the arbitrator. See\n388 U. S., at 403\u2013404; see also Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444\u2013\n445. The Prima Paint rule is akin to a pleading standard,\nwhereby a party seeking to challenge the validity of an\narbitration agreement must expressly say so in order to\nget his dispute into court.\n   In sum, questions related to the validity of an arbitra\ntion agreement are usually matters for a court to resolve\nbefore it refers a dispute to arbitration. But questions of\narbitrability may go to the arbitrator in two instances: (1)\nwhen the parties have demonstrated, clearly and unmis\ntakably, that it is their intent to do so; or (2) when the\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement depends exclusively\non the validity of the substantive contract of which it is a\npart.\n                              II\n   We might have resolved this case by simply applying the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconduct. Respondents in that case had participated in the arbitration,\nbut only to object to proceeding in arbitration and to challenge the\narbitrators\u2019 jurisdiction. That kind of participation\u2014in protest, to\npreserve legal claims\u2014did not constitute unmistakable assent to be\nbound by the result.

Even if First Options relates only to \u201cmanifestations of intent,\u201d\nas the Court states, see ante, at 5\u20136, n. 1 (emphasis deleted), whether\nthere has been meaningful agreement surely bears some relation to\nwhether one party has manifested intent to be bound to an agreement.\n   7 The question of unconscionability in this case is one of state law.\n\nSee, e.g., Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492, n. 9 (1987). Under\nNevada law, unconscionability requires a showing of \u201c \u2018both procedural\nand substantive unconscionability,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cless evidence of substantive\nunconscionability is required in cases involving great procedural\nunconscionability.\u201d D. R. Horton, Inc. v. Green, 120 Nev. 549, 553\u2013554,\n96 P. 3d 1159, 1162 (2004). I understand respondent to have claimed,\nin accord with Nevada law, that the arbitration agreement contained\nsubstantively unconscionable provisions, and was also the product of\nprocedural unconscionability as a whole. See Brief for Respondent 3\n(\u201c[Respondent] argued that the clause is procedurally unconscionable\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthat the agreement\u2019s \u201cdelegation\u201d provision suggests\nassent is beside the point, because the gravamen of re\nspondent\u2019s claim is that he never consented to the terms in\nhis agreement.\n   In other words, when a party raises a good-faith validity\nchallenge to the arbitration agreement itself, that issue\nmust be resolved before a court can say that he clearly and\nunmistakably intended to arbitrate that very validity\nquestion. This case well illustrates the point: If respon\ndent\u2019s unconscionability claim is correct\u2014i.e., if the terms\nof the agreement are so one-sided and the process of its\nmaking so unfair\u2014it would contravene the existence of\nclear and unmistakable assent to arbitrate the very ques\ntion petitioner now seeks to arbitrate. Accordingly, it is\nnecessary for the court to resolve the merits of respon\ndent\u2019s unconscionability claim in order to decide whether\nthe parties have a valid arbitration agreement under \u00a72.\nOtherwise, that section\u2019s preservation of revocation issues\nfor the Court would be meaningless.\n   This is, in essence, how I understand the Court of Ap\npeals to have decided the issue below. See 581 F. 3d 912,\n917 (CA9 2009) (\u201c[W]e hold that where, as here, a party\nchallenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable,\nand thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nbecause he was in a position of unequal bargaining power when it was\nimposed as a condition of employment\u201d); id., at 3\u20134 (identifying three\ndistinct provisions of the agreement that were substantively uncon\nscionable); accord, 581 F. 3d, at 917.\n  Some of respondent\u2019s arguments, however, could be understood as\nattacks not on the enforceability of the agreement as a whole but\nmerely on the fairness of individual contract terms. Such term-specific\nchallenges would generally be for the arbitrator to resolve (at least so\nlong as they do not go to the identity of the arbitrator or the ability of a\nparty to initiate arbitration). Cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\u00a7208 (1979) (providing that \u201ca contract or term thereof [may be] uncon\nscionable\u201d and that in the latter case \u201cthe remainder of the contract\nwithout the unconscionable term\u201d may be enforced).\n8            RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability\nis for the court\u201d). I would therefore affirm its judgment,\nleaving, as it did, the merits of respondent\u2019s unconscion\nability claim for the District Court to resolve on remand.\n                             III\n   Rather than apply First Options, the Court takes us\ndown a different path, one neither briefed by the parties\nnor relied upon by the Court of Appeals. In applying\nPrima Paint, the Court has unwisely extended a \u201cfantas\ntic\u201d and likely erroneous decision. 388 U. S., at 407\n(Black, J., dissenting).8\n   As explained at the outset, see supra, at 3\u20137, this case\nlies at a seeming crossroads in our arbitration jurispru\ndence. It implicates cases such as First Options, which\naddress whether the parties intended to delegate ques\ntions of arbitrability, and also those cases, such as Prima\nPaint, which address the severability of a presumptively\nvalid arbitration agreement from a potentially invalid\ncontract. The question of \u201cWho decides?\u201d\u2014arbitrator or\ncourt\u2014animates both lines of cases, but they are driven by\ndifferent concerns. In cases like First Options, we are\nconcerned with the parties\u2019 intentions. In cases like Prima\nPaint, we are concerned with how the parties challenge\nthe validity of the agreement.\n   Under the Prima Paint inquiry, recall, we consider\nwhether the parties are actually challenging the validity\nof the arbitration agreement, or whether they are chal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Justice Black quite reasonably characterized the Court\u2019s holding in\n\nPrima Paint as \u201cfantastic,\u201d id., at 407 (dissenting opinion), because the\nholding was, in his view, inconsistent with the text of \u00a72 of the FAA,\n388 U. S., at 412, as well as the intent of the draftsmen of the legisla\ntion, id., at 413\u2013416. Nevertheless, the narrow holding in that case has\nbeen followed numerous times, see Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.\nCardegna, 546 U. S. 440 (2006), and Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346\n(2008), and, as the Court correctly notes today, neither party has asked\nus to revisit those cases, ante, at 6.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlenging, more generally, the contract within which an\narbitration clause is nested. In the latter circumstance,\nwe assume there is no infirmity per se with the arbitration\nagreement, i.e., there are no grounds for revocation of the\narbitration agreement itself under \u00a72 of the FAA. Accord\ningly, we commit the parties\u2019 general contract dispute to\nthe arbitrator, as agreed.\n   The claim in Prima Paint was that one party would not\nhave agreed to contract with the other for services had it\nknown the second party was insolvent (a fact known but\nnot disclosed at the time of contracting). 388 U. S., at 398.\nThere was, therefore, allegedly fraud in the inducement of\nthe contract\u2014a contract which also delegated disputes to\nan arbitrator. Despite the fact that the claim raised would\nhave, if successful, rendered the embedded arbitration\nclause void, the Court held that the merits of the dispute\nwere for the arbitrator, so long as the claim of \u201cfraud in\nthe inducement\u201d did not go to validity of \u201cthe arbitration\nclause itself.\u201d Id., at 403 (emphasis added). Because, in\nPrima Paint, \u201cno claim ha[d] been advanced by Prima\nPaint that [respondent] fraudulently induced it to enter\ninto the agreement to arbitrate,\u201d and because the arbitra\ntion agreement was broad enough to cover the dispute, the\narbitration agreement was enforceable with respect to the\ncontroversy at hand. Id., at 406.\n   The Prima Paint rule has been denominated as one\nrelated to severability. Our opinion in Buckeye, set out\nthese guidelines:\n    \u201cFirst, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration\n    law, an arbitration provision is severable from the\n    remainder of the contract. Second, unless the chal\n    lenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the\n    contract\u2019s validity is considered by the arbitrator in\n    the first instance.\u201d 546 U. S., at 445\u2013446.\nWhether the general contract defense renders the entire\n10          RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nagreement void or voidable is irrelevant. Id., at 446. All\nthat matters is whether the party seeking to present the\nissue to a court has brought a \u201cdiscrete challenge,\u201d Preston\nv. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 354 (2008), \u201cto the validity of the\n. . . arbitration clause.\u201d Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 449.\n    Prima Paint and its progeny allow a court to pluck from\na potentially invalid contract a potentially valid arbitra\ntion agreement. Today the Court adds a new layer of\nseverability\u2014something akin to Russian nesting dolls\u2014\ninto the mix: Courts may now pluck from a potentially\ninvalid arbitration agreement even narrower provisions\nthat refer particular arbitrability disputes to an arbitra\ntor. See ante, at 6\u20137. I do not think an agreement to\narbitrate can ever manifest a clear and unmistakable\nintent to arbitrate its own validity. But even assuming\notherwise, I certainly would not hold that the Prima Paint\nrule extends this far.\n    In my view, a general revocation challenge to a stand\nalone arbitration agreement is, invariably, a challenge to\nthe \u201c \u2018making\u2019 \u201d of the arbitration agreement itself, Prima\nPaint, 388 U. S., at 403, and therefore, under Prima Paint,\nmust be decided by the court. A claim of procedural un\nconscionability aims to undermine the formation of the\narbitration agreement, much like a claim of unconscion\nability aims to undermine the clear-and-unmistakable\nintent requirement necessary for a valid delegation of a\n\u201cdiscrete\u201d challenge to the validity of the arbitration agree\nment itself, Preston, 552 U. S., at 354. Moreover, because\nwe are dealing in this case with a challenge to an inde\npendently executed arbitration agreement\u2014rather than a\nclause contained in a contract related to another subject\nmatter\u2014any challenge to the contract itself is also, neces\nsarily, a challenge to the arbitration agreement.9 They are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 As respondent asserted in his opposition to petitioner\u2019s motion to\n\ncompel arbitration, \u201cthe lack of mutuality regarding the type of claims\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\none and the same.\n   The Court, however, reads the delegation clause as a\ndistinct mini-arbitration agreement divisible from the\ncontract in which it resides\u2014which just so happens also to\nbe an arbitration agreement. Ante, at 6\u20137. Although the\nCourt simply declares that it \u201cmakes no difference\u201d that\nthe underlying subject matter of the agreement is itself an\narbitration agreement, ante, at 7, that proposition does not\nfollow from\u2014rather it is at odds with\u2014Prima Paint\u2019s\nseverability rule.\n   Had the parties in this case executed only one contract,\non two sheets of paper\u2014one sheet with employment\nterms, and a second with arbitration terms\u2014the contract\nwould look much like the one in Buckeye. There would be\nsome substantive terms, followed by some arbitration\nterms, including what we now call a delegation clause\u2014\ni.e., a sentence or two assigning to the arbitrator any\ndisputes related to the validity of the arbitration provi\nsion. See Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 442. If respondent then\ncame into court claiming that the contract was illegal as a\nwhole for some reason unrelated to the arbitration provi\nsion, the Prima Paint rule would apply, and such a gen\neral challenge to the subject matter of the contract would\ngo to the arbitrator. Such a challenge would not call into\nquestion the making of the arbitration agreement or its\ninvalidity per se.\n   Before today, however, if respondent instead raised a\nchallenge specific to \u201cthe validity of the agreement to\narbitrate\u201d\u2014for example, that the agreement to arbitrate\nwas void under state law\u2014the challenge would have gone\nto the court. That is what Buckeye says. See 546 U. S., at\n444. But the Court now declares that Prima Paint\u2019s plead\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nthat must be arbitrated, the fee provision, and the discovery provision, \n\nso permeate the Defendant\u2019s arbitration agreement that it would be\n\nimpossible to sever the offending provisions.\u201d App. 45. \n\n12         RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ning rule requires more: A party must lodge a challenge\nwith even greater specificity than what would have satis\nfied the Prima Paint Court. A claim that an entire arbi\ntration agreement is invalid will not go to the court unless\nthe party challenges the particular sentences that delegate\nsuch claims to the arbitrator, on some contract ground\nthat is particular and unique to those sentences. See ante,\nat 8\u201310.\n   It would seem the Court reads Prima Paint to require,\nas a matter of course, infinite layers of severability: We\nmust always pluck from an arbitration agreement the\nspecific delegation mechanism that would\u2014but for present\njudicial review\u2014commend the matter to arbitration, even\nif this delegation clause is but one sentence within one\nparagraph within a standalone agreement. And, most\nimportantly, the party must identify this one sentence and\nlodge a specific challenge to its validity. Otherwise, he\nwill be bound to pursue his validity claim in arbitration.\n   Even if limited to separately executed arbitration\nagreements, however, such an infinite severability rule is\ndivorced from the underlying rationale of Prima Paint.\nThe notion that a party may be bound by an arbitration\nclause in a contract that is nevertheless invalid may be\ndifficult for any lawyer\u2014or any person\u2014to accept, but this\nis the law of Prima Paint. It reflects a judgment that the\n\u201c \u2018national policy favoring arbitration,\u2019 \u201d Preston, 552 U. S.,\nat 353, outweighs the interest in preserving a judicial\nforum for questions of arbitrability\u2014but only when ques\ntions of arbitrability are bound up in an underlying dis\npute. Prima Paint, 388 U. S., at 404. When the two are so\nbound up, there is actually no gateway matter at all: The\nquestion \u201cWho decides\u201d is the entire ball game. Were a\ncourt to decide the fraudulent inducement question in\nPrima Paint, in order to decide the antecedent question of\nthe validity of the included arbitration agreement, then it\nwould also, necessarily, decide the merits of the underly\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ning dispute. Same, too, for the question of illegality in\nBuckeye; on its way to deciding the arbitration agree\nment\u2019s validity, the court would have to decide whether\nthe contract was illegal, and in so doing, it would decide\nthe merits of the entire dispute.\n   In this case, however, resolution of the unconscionability\nquestion will have no bearing on the merits of the underly\ning employment dispute. It will only, as a preliminary\nmatter, resolve who should decide the merits of that dis\npute. Resolution of the unconscionability question will,\nhowever, decide whether the arbitration agreement itself\nis \u201cvalid\u201d under \u201csuch grounds as exist at law or in equity\nfor the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72. As\nPrima Paint recognizes, the FAA commits those gateway\nmatters, specific to the arbitration agreement, to the\ncourt. 388 U. S., at 403\u2013404. Indeed, it is clear that the\npresent controversy over whether the arbitration agree\nment is unconscionable is itself severable from the merits\nof the underlying dispute, which involves a claim of em\nployment discrimination. This is true for all gateway\nmatters, and for this reason Prima Paint has no applica\ntion in this case.\n                            IV\n   While I may have to accept the \u201cfantastic\u201d holding in\nPrima Paint, id., at 407 (Black, J., dissenting), I most\ncertainly do not accept the Court\u2019s even more fantastic\nreasoning today. I would affirm the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals, and therefore respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued April 26, 2010\u2014Decided June 21, 2010\nRespondent Jackson filed an employment-discrimination suit against\n  petitioner Rent-A-Center, his former employer, in a Nevada Federal\n  District Court. Rent-A-Center filed a motion, under the Federal Ar\n  bitration Act (FAA), to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S. C. \u00a73,\n  and to compel arbitration, \u00a74, based on the arbitration agreement\n  (Agreement) Jackson signed as a condition of his employment. Jack\n  son opposed the motion on the ground that the Agreement was unen\n  forceable in that it was unconscionable under Nevada law. The Dis\n  trict Court granted Rent-A-Center\u2019s motion. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed in relevant part.\nHeld: Under the FAA, where an agreement to arbitrate includes an\n agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the\n agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that\n particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if\n a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the\n challenge is for the arbitrator. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) Section 2 of the FAA places arbitration agreements on an equal\n footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.\n Cardegna, 546 U.

See, e.g.,\n    Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83\u201385. The\n    court must enforce the delegation provision under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4 unless it\n    is unenforceable under \u00a72. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) There are two types of validity challenges under \u00a72: one \u201cchal\n    lenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate,\u201d and\n    \u201c[t]he other challenges the contract as a whole,\u201d Buckeye, supra, at\n    444. Only the first is relevant to a court\u2019s determination of an arbi\n    tration agreement\u2019s enforceability, see, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v.\n    Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403\u2013404, because under \u00a72\n    \u201can arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the con\n    tract,\u201d Buckeye, supra, at 445. That does not mean that agreements\n    to arbitrate are unassailable. If a party challenges the validity under\n    \u00a72 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court\n    must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with the\n    agreement under \u00a74. That is no less true when the precise agree\n    ment to arbitrate is itself part of a larger arbitration agreement. Be\n    cause here the agreement to arbitrate enforceability (the delegation\n    provision) is severable from the remainder of the Agreement, unless\n    Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, it must be\n    treated as valid under \u00a72 and enforced under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4. Pp. 6\u20139.\n       (c) The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged\n    only the validity of the contract as a whole. In his brief to this Court\n    he raised a challenge to the delegation provision for the first time,\n    but that is too late and will not be considered. See 14 Penn Plaza\n    LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.

The defendant and petitioner here, Rent-\nA-Center, West, Inc., filed a motion under the FAA to\ndismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U. S. C. \u00a73, and to com\npel arbitration, \u00a74. Rent-A-Center argued that the Mutual\nAgreement to Arbitrate Claims (Agreement), which Jack\nson signed on February 24, 2003 as a condition of his\nemployment there, precluded Jackson from pursuing his\nclaims in court. The Agreement provided for arbitration of\nall \u201cpast, present or future\u201d disputes arising out of Jack\nson\u2019s employment with Rent-A-Center, including \u201cclaims\n2         RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor discrimination\u201d and \u201cclaims for violation of any federal\n. . . law.\u201d App. 29\u201330. It also provided that \u201c[t]he Arbitra\ntor, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,\nshall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute\nrelating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability\nor formation of this Agreement including, but not limited\nto any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void\nor voidable.\u201d Id., at 34.\n   Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that \u201cthe\narbitration agreement in question is clearly unenforceable\nin that it is unconscionable\u201d under Nevada law. Id., at 40.\nRent-A-Center responded that Jackson\u2019s unconscionability\nclaim was not properly before the court because Jackson\nhad expressly agreed that the arbitrator would have ex\nclusive authority to resolve any dispute about the enforce\nability of the Agreement. It also disputed the merits of\nJackson\u2019s unconscionability claims.\n   The District Court granted Rent-A-Center\u2019s motion to\ndismiss the proceedings and to compel arbitration. The\ncourt found that the Agreement \u201c \u2018 \u201cclearly and unmistak\nenly [sic]\u201d \u2019 \u201d gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to\ndecide whether the Agreement is enforceable, App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 4a. (quoting Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds,\nInc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002)), and, because Jackson chal\nlenged the validity of the Agreement as a whole, the issue\nwas for the arbitrator, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a (citing\nBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,\n444\u2013445 (2006)). The court noted that even if it were to\nexamine the merits of Jackson\u2019s unconscionability claims,\nit would have rejected the claim that the agreement to\nsplit arbitration fees was substantively unconscionable\nunder Nevada law. It did not address Jackson\u2019s proce\ndural or other substantive unconscionability arguments.\n   Without oral argument, a divided panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, affirmed in\npart, and remanded. 581 F. 3d 912 (2009).

S. ____ (2010)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreversed on the question of who (the court or arbitrator)\nhad the authority to decide whether the Agreement is\nenforceable. It noted that \u201cJackson does not dispute that\nthe language of the Agreement clearly assigns the arbitra\nbility determination to the arbitrator,\u201d but held that where\n\u201ca party challenges an arbitration agreement as uncon\nscionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully\nassent to the agreement, the threshold question of uncon\nscionability is for the court.\u201d Id., at 917. The Ninth Cir\ncuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s alternative conclusion\nthat the fee-sharing provision was not substantively un\nconscionable and remanded for consideration of Jackson\u2019s\nother unconscionability arguments. Id., at 919\u2013920, and\nn. 3. Judge Hall dissented on the ground that \u201cthe ques\ntion of the arbitration agreement\u2019s validity should have\ngone to the arbitrator, as the parties \u2018clearly and unmis\ntakably provide[d]\u2019 in their agreement.\u201d Id., at 921.\n   We granted certiorari, 558 U. S. ___ (2010).\n                             II \n\n                             A\n\n  The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbi\ntration is a matter of contract. Section 2, the \u201cprimary\nsubstantive provision of the Act,\u201d Moses H. Cone Memorial\nHospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 24 (1983),\nprovides:\n       \u201cA written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a\n    transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitra\n    tion a controversy thereafter arising out of such con\n    tract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\n    save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for\n    the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72.\nThe FAA thereby places arbitration agreements on an\nequal footing with other contracts, Buckeye, supra, at 443,\nand requires courts to enforce them according to their\n4         RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nterms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees\nof Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 478\n(1989). Like other contracts, however, they may be invali\ndated by \u201cgenerally applicable contract defenses, such as\nfraud, duress, or unconscionability.\u201d Doctor\u2019s Associates,\nInc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681, 687 (1996).\n   The Act also establishes procedures by which federal\ncourts implement \u00a72\u2019s substantive rule. Under \u00a73, a party\nmay apply to a federal court for a stay of the trial of an\naction \u201cupon any issue referable to arbitration under an\nagreement in writing for such arbitration.\u201d Under \u00a74, a\nparty \u201caggrieved\u201d by the failure of another party \u201cto arbi\ntrate under a written agreement for arbitration\u201d may\npetition a federal court \u201cfor an order directing that such\narbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such\nagreement.\u201d The court \u201cshall\u201d order arbitration \u201cupon\nbeing satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbi\ntration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue.\u201d\nIbid.\n   The Agreement here contains multiple \u201cwritten provi\nsion[s]\u201d to \u201csettle by arbitration a controversy,\u201d \u00a72. Two\nare relevant to our discussion. First, the section titled\n\u201cClaims Covered By The Agreement\u201d provides for arbitra\ntion of all \u201cpast, present or future\u201d disputes arising out of\nJackson\u2019s employment with Rent-A-Center. App. 29.\nSecond, the section titled \u201cArbitration Procedures\u201d pro\nvides that \u201c[t]he Arbitrator . . . shall have exclusive au\nthority to resolve any dispute relating to the . . . enforce\nability . . . of this Agreement including, but not limited to\nany claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or\nvoidable.\u201d Id., at 32, 34. The current \u201ccontroversy\u201d be\ntween the parties is whether the Agreement is uncon\nscionable. It is the second provision, which delegates\nresolution of that controversy to the arbitrator, that Rent-\nA-Center seeks to enforce. Adopting the terminology used\nby the parties, we will refer to it as the delegation provi\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsion.\n  The delegation provision is an agreement to arbitrate\nthreshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement.\nWe have recognized that parties can agree to arbitrate\n\u201cgateway\u201d questions of \u201carbitrability,\u201d such as whether the\nparties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agree\nment covers a particular controversy. See, e.g., Howsam,\n537 U. S., at 83\u201385; Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,\n539 U. S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion). This line of\ncases merely reflects the principle that arbitration is a\nmatter of contract.1 See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 There is one caveat. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514\n\nU. S. 938, 944 (1995), held that \u201c[c]ourts should not assume that the\nparties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is \u2018clea[r] and\nunmistakabl[e]\u2019 evidence that they did so.\u201d The parties agree the\nheightened standard applies here. See Brief for Petitioner 21; Brief for\nRespondent 54. The District Court concluded the \u201cAgreement to\nArbitrate clearly and unmistakenly [sic] provides the arbitrator with\nthe exclusive authority to decide whether the Agreement to Arbitrate is\nenforceable.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The Ninth Circuit noted that\nJackson did not dispute that the text of the Agreement was clear and\nunmistakable on this point. 581 F. 3d 912, 917 (2009). He also does\nnot dispute it here. What he argues now, however, is that it is not\n\u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d that his agreement to that text was valid,\nbecause of the unconscionability claims he raises. See Brief for Re\nspondent 54\u201355. The dissent makes the same argument. See post, at\n5\u20138 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).\n   This mistakes the subject of the First Options \u201cclear and unmistak\nable\u201d requirement. It pertains to the parties\u2019 manifestation of intent,\nnot the agreement\u2019s validity. As explained in Howsam v. Dean Witter\nReynolds, Inc., 537 U. S. 79, 83 (2002), it is an \u201cinterpretive rule,\u201d based\non an assumption about the parties\u2019 expectations. In \u201ccircumstance[s]\nwhere contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have\ndecided the gateway matter,\u201d ibid., we assume that is what they agreed\nto. Thus, \u201c[u]nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide\notherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to\nbe decided by the court, not the arbitrator.\u201d AT&T Technologies, Inc. v.\nCommunications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986).\n   The validity of a written agreement to arbitrate (whether it is legally\nbinding, as opposed to whether it was in fact agreed to\u2014including, of\n6           RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nKaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 943 (1995). An agreement to arbi\ntrate a gateway issue is simply an additional, antecedent\nagreement the party seeking arbitration asks the federal\ncourt to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional\narbitration agreement just as it does on any other. The\nadditional agreement is valid under \u00a72 \u201csave upon such\ngrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of\nany contract,\u201d and federal courts can enforce the agree\nment by staying federal litigation under \u00a73 and compelling\narbitration under \u00a74. The question before us, then, is\nwhether the delegation provision is valid under \u00a72.\n                             B\n   There are two types of validity challenges under \u00a72:\n\u201cOne type challenges specifically the validity of the\nagreement to arbitrate,\u201d and \u201c[t]he other challenges the\ncontract as a whole, either on a ground that directly af\nfects the entire agreement (e.g., the agreement was\nfraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality\nof one of the contract\u2019s provisions renders the whole con\ntract invalid.\u201d Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444. In a line of\ncases neither party has asked us to overrule, we held that\nonly the first type of challenge is relevant to a court\u2019s\ndetermination whether the arbitration agreement at issue\nis enforceable.2 See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin\nMfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395, 403\u2013404 (1967); Buckeye, supra, at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncourse, whether it was void for unconscionability) is governed by \u00a72\u2019s\nprovision that it shall be valid \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law\nor equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d Those grounds do not\ninclude, of course, any requirement that its lack of unconscionability\nmust be \u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d And they are not grounds that First\nOptions added for agreements to arbitrate gateway issues; \u00a72 applies to\nall written agreements to arbitrate.\n  2 The issue of the agreement\u2019s \u201cvalidity\u201d is different from the issue\n\nwhether any agreement between the parties \u201cwas ever concluded,\u201d and,\nas in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440 (2006),\nwe address only the former. Id., at 444, n. 1.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n444\u2013446; Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 353\u2013354 (2008).\nThat is because \u00a72 states that a \u201cwritten provision\u201d \u201cto\nsettle by arbitration a controversy\u201d is \u201cvalid, irrevocable,\nand enforceable\u201d without mention of the validity of the\ncontract in which it is contained. Thus, a party\u2019s chal\nlenge to another provision of the contract, or to the con\ntract as a whole, does not prevent a court from enforcing a\nspecific agreement to arbitrate. \u201c[A]s a matter of substan\ntive federal arbitration law, an arbitration provision is\nseverable from the remainder of the contract.\u201d Buckeye,\n546 U. S., at 445; see also id., at 447 (the severability rule\nis based on \u00a72).\n   But that agreements to arbitrate are severable does not\nmean that they are unassailable. If a party challenges the\nvalidity under \u00a72 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at\nissue, the federal court must consider the challenge before\nordering compliance with that agreement under \u00a74. In\nPrima Paint, for example, if the claim had been \u201cfraud in\nthe inducement of the arbitration clause itself,\u201d then the\ncourt would have considered it. 388 U. S., at 403\u2013404.\n\u201cTo immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial\nchallenge on the ground of fraud in the inducement would\nbe to elevate it over other forms of contract,\u201d id., at 404,\nn. 12. In some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the\ncontract as a whole will be much easier to establish than\nthe same basis as applied only to the severable agreement\nto arbitrate. Thus, in an employment contract many\nelements of alleged unconscionability applicable to the\nentire contract (outrageously low wages, for example)\nwould not affect the agreement to arbitrate alone. But\neven where that is not the case\u2014as in Prima Paint itself,\nwhere the alleged fraud that induced the whole contract\nequally induced the agreement to arbitrate which was part\nof that contract\u2014we nonetheless require the basis of\nchallenge to be directed specifically to the agreement to\narbitrate before the court will intervene.\n8            RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n   Here, the \u201cwritten provision . . . to settle by arbitration a\ncontroversy,\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72, that Rent-A-Center asks us to\nenforce is the delegation provision\u2014the provision that\ngave the arbitrator \u201cexclusive authority to resolve any\ndispute relating to the . . . enforceability . . . of this\nAgreement,\u201d App. 34. The \u201cremainder of the contract,\u201d\nBuckeye, supra, at 445, is the rest of the agreement to\narbitrate claims arising out of Jackson\u2019s employment with\nRent-A-Center. To be sure this case differs from Prima\nPaint, Buckeye, and Preston, in that the arbitration provi\nsions sought to be enforced in those cases were contained\nin contracts unrelated to arbitration\u2014contracts for con\nsulting services, see Prima Paint, supra, at 397, check\ncashing services, see Buckeye, supra, at 442, and \u201cpersonal\nmanagement\u201d or \u201ctalent agent\u201d services, see Preston,\nsupra, at 352. In this case, the underlying contract is\nitself an arbitration agreement. But that makes no differ\nence.3 Application of the severability rule does not depend\non the substance of the remainder of the contract. Section\n2 operates on the specific \u201cwritten provision\u201d to \u201csettle by\narbitration a controversy\u201d that the party seeks to enforce.\nAccordingly, unless Jackson challenged the delegation\nprovision specifically, we must treat it as valid under \u00a72,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 The\n        dissent calls this a \u201cbreezy assertion,\u201d post, at 1, but it seems to\nus self-evident. When the dissent comes to discussing the point, post,\nat 11, it gives no logical reason why an agreement to arbitrate one\ncontroversy (an employment-discrimination claim) is not severable from\nan agreement to arbitrate a different controversy (enforceability).\nThere is none. Since the dissent accepts that the invalidity of one\nprovision within an arbitration agreement does not necessarily invali\ndate its other provisions, post, at 7, n. 7, it cannot believe in some sort\nof magic bond between arbitration provisions that prevents them from\nbeing severed from each other. According to the dissent, it is fine to\nsever an invalid provision within an arbitration agreement when\nseverability is a matter of state law, but severability is not allowed\nwhen it comes to applying Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg.\nCo., 388 U. S. 395 (1967).\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand must enforce it under \u00a7\u00a73 and 4, leaving any chal\nlenge to the validity of the Agreement as a whole for the\narbitrator.\n                             C\n   The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson\nchallenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.\nNowhere in his opposition to Rent-A-Center\u2019s motion to\ncompel arbitration did he even mention the delegation\nprovision. See App. 39\u201347. Rent-A-Center noted this fact\nin its reply: \u201c[Jackson\u2019s response] fails to rebut or other\nwise address in any way [Rent-A-Center\u2019s] argument that\nthe Arbitrator must decide [Jackson\u2019s] challenge to\nthe enforceability of the Agreement. Thus, [Rent-A-\nCenter\u2019s] argument is uncontested.\u201d Id., at 50 (emphasis in\noriginal).\n   The arguments Jackson made in his response to Rent-A-\nCenter\u2019s motion to compel arbitration support this conclu\nsion. Jackson stated that \u201cthe entire agreement seems\ndrawn to provide [Rent-A-Center] with undue advantages\nshould an employment-related dispute arise.\u201d Id., at 44\n(emphasis added). At one point, he argued that the limita\ntions on discovery \u201cfurther suppor[t] [his] contention that\nthe arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively\nunconscionable.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added). And before this\nCourt, Jackson describes his challenge in the District\nCourt as follows: He \u201copposed the motion to compel on the\nground that the entire arbitration agreement, including the\ndelegation clause, was unconscionable.\u201d Brief for Respon\ndent 55 (emphasis added). That is an accurate description\nof his filings.\n   As required to make out a claim of unconscionability\nunder Nevada law, see 581 F. 3d, at 919, he contended\nthat the Agreement was both procedurally and substan\ntively unconscionable. It was procedurally unconscion\nable, he argued, because it \u201cwas imposed as a condition of\n10        RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nemployment and was non-negotiable.\u201d App. 41. But we\nneed not consider that claim because none of Jackson\u2019s\nsubstantive unconscionability challenges was specific to\nthe delegation provision. First, he argued that the Agree\nment\u2019s coverage was one sided in that it required arbitra\ntion of claims an employee was likely to bring\u2014contract,\ntort, discrimination, and statutory claims\u2014but did not\nrequire arbitration of claims Rent-A-Center was likely to\nbring\u2014intellectual property, unfair competition, and trade\nsecrets claims. Id., at 42\u201343. This one-sided-coverage\nargument clearly did not go to the validity of the delega\ntion provision.\n   Jackson\u2019s other two substantive unconscionability ar\nguments assailed arbitration procedures called for by the\ncontract\u2014the fee-splitting arrangement and the limita\ntions on discovery\u2014procedures that were to be used dur\ning arbitration under both the agreement to arbitrate\nemployment-related disputes and the delegation provision.\nIt may be that had Jackson challenged the delegation\nprovision by arguing that these common procedures as\napplied to the delegation provision rendered that provision\nunconscionable, the challenge should have been consid\nered by the court. To make such a claim based on the\ndiscovery procedures, Jackson would have had to argue\nthat the limitation upon the number of depositions causes\nthe arbitration of his claim that the Agreement is unen\nforceable to be unconscionable. That would be, of course, a\nmuch more difficult argument to sustain than the argu\nment that the same limitation renders arbitration of his\nfactbound employment-discrimination claim unconscion\nable. Likewise, the unfairness of the fee-splitting ar\nrangement may be more difficult to establish for the arbi\ntration of enforceability than for arbitration of more\ncomplex and fact-related aspects of the alleged employ\nment discrimination. Jackson, however, did not make any\narguments specific to the delegation provision; he argued\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the fee-sharing and discovery procedures rendered\nthe entire Agreement invalid.\n    Jackson\u2019s appeal to the Ninth Circuit confirms that he\ndid not contest the validity of the delegation provision in\nparticular. His brief noted the existence of the delegation\nprovision, Brief for Appellant in No. 07\u201316164, p. 3, but\nhis unconscionability arguments made no mention of it,\nid., at 3\u20137. He also repeated the arguments he had made\nbefore the District Court, see supra, at 9, that the \u201centire\nagreement\u201d favors Rent-A-Center and that the limitations\non discovery further his \u201ccontention that the arbitration\nagreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable,\u201d\nBrief for Appellant 7\u20138. Finally, he repeated the argu\nment made in his District Court filings, that under state\nlaw the unconscionable clauses could not be severed from\nthe arbitration agreement, see id., at 8\u20139.4 The point of\nthis argument, of course, is that the Agreement as a whole\nis unconscionable under state law.\n    Jackson repeated that argument before this Court. At\noral argument, counsel stated: \u201cThere are certain elements\nof the arbitration agreement that are unconscionable and,\nunder Nevada law, which would render the entire arbitra\ntion agreement unconscionable.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (em\nphasis added). And again, he stated, \u201cwe\u2019ve got both\ncertain provisions that are unconscionable, that under\nNevada law render the entire agreement unconscionable\n. . . , and that\u2019s what the Court is to rely on.\u201d Id., at 43\u201344\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Jackson\u2019s argument fails. The severability rule is a \u201cmatter of sub\n\nstantive federal arbitration law,\u201d and we have repeatedly \u201crejected the\nview that the question of \u2018severability\u2019 was one of state law, so that if\nstate law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge\nto the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.\u201d Buckeye, 546\nU.

Its breezy assertion that\nthe subject matter of the contract at issue\u2014in this case, an\narbitration agreement and nothing more\u2014\u201cmakes no\ndifference,\u201d ante, at 7, is simply wrong.

JACKSON\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\narbitration agreement is but one part of a broader em\nployment agreement between the parties, just as the\narbitration clause in Prima Paint was but one part of a\nbroader contract for services between those parties. Thus,\nthat the subject matter of the agreement is exclusively\narbitration makes all the difference in the Prima Paint\nanalysis.\n                             I\n   Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a71\u201316, parties generally have substantial leeway to\ndefine the terms and scope of their agreement to settle\ndisputes in an arbitral forum. \u201c[A]rbitration is,\u201d after all,\n\u201csimply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a\nway to resolve those disputes\u2014but only those disputes\u2014\nthat the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\u201d\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938,\n943 (1995). The FAA, therefore, envisions a limited role\nfor courts asked to stay litigation and refer disputes to\narbitration.\n   Certain issues\u2014the kind that \u201ccontracting parties would\nlikely have expected a court to have decided\u201d\u2014remain\nwithin the province of judicial review.

S., at 947.\n   \u201c[Q]uestion[s] of arbitrability\u201d thus include questions\nregarding the existence of a legally binding and valid\narbitration agreement, as well as questions regarding the\nscope of a concededly binding arbitration agreement. In\nthis case we are concerned with the first of these catego\nries: whether the parties have a valid arbitration agree\nment. This is an issue the FAA assigns to the courts.2\nSection 2 of the FAA dictates that covered arbitration\nagreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\nsave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72. \u201c[S]uch\ngrounds,\u201d which relate to contract validity and formation,\ninclude the claim at issue in this case, unconscionability.\nSee Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U. S. 681,\n687 (1996).\n   Two different lines of cases bear on the issue of who\ndecides a question of arbitrability respecting validity, such\nas whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable.\nAlthough this issue, as a gateway matter, is typically for\nthe court, we have explained that such an issue can be\ndelegated to the arbitrator in some circumstances. When\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although it is not clear from our precedents, I understand \u201cgateway\n\nmatters\u201d and \u201cquestions of arbitrability\u201d to be roughly synonymous, if\nnot exactly so. At the very least, the former includes all of the latter.\n  2 Gateway issues involving the scope of an otherwise valid arbitration\n\nagreement also have a statutory origin. Section 3 of the FAA provides\nthat \u201cupon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit . . . is\nreferable to arbitration under such an agreement,\u201d a court \u201cshall . . .\nstay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had.\u201d 9\nU. S. C. \u00a73.\n4            RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe parties have purportedly done so, courts must examine\ntwo distinct rules to decide whether the delegation is\nvalid.\n   The first line of cases looks to the parties\u2019 intent. In\nAT&T Technologies, we stated that \u201cquestion[s] of arbi\ntrability\u201d may be delegated to the arbitrator, so long as the\ndelegation is clear and unmistakable. 475 U. S., at 649.\nWe reaffirmed this rule, and added some nuance, in First\nOptions. Against the background presumption that ques\ntions of arbitrability go to the court, we stated that federal\ncourts should \u201cgenerally\u201d apply \u201cordinary state-law princi\nples that govern the formation of contracts\u201d to assess\n\u201cwhether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter\n(including arbitrability).\u201d 514 U. S., at 944. But, we\nadded, a more rigorous standard applies when the inquiry\nis whether the parties have \u201cagreed to arbitrate arbitrabil\nity\u201d: \u201cCourts should not assume that the parties agreed to\narbitrate arbitrability unless there is clear and unmistak\nable evidence that they did so.\u201d3 Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted). JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s unani\nmous opinion for the Court described this standard as a\ntype of \u201crevers[e]\u201d \u201cpresumption\u201d4\u2014one in favor of a judi\ncial, rather than an arbitral, forum. Id., at 945. Clear and\nunmistakable \u201cevidence\u201d of agreement to arbitrate arbi\ntrability might include, as was urged in First Options, a\ncourse of conduct demonstrating assent,5 id., at 946, or, as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 We  have not expressly decided whether the First Options delegation\nprinciple would apply to questions of arbitrability that implicate \u00a72\nconcerns, i.e., grounds for contract revocation. I do not need to weigh in\non this issue in order to resolve the present case.\n   4 It is a \u201crevers[e]\u201d presumption because it is counter to the presump\n\ntion we usually apply in favor of arbitration when the question con\ncerns whether a particular dispute falls within the scope of a conced\nedly binding arbitration agreement. First Options, 514 U. S., at 944\u2013\n945.\n   5 In First Options we found no clear and unmistakable assent to dele\n\ngate to the arbitrator questions of arbitrability, given the parties\u2019\n                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  5\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nis urged in this case, an express agreement to do so. In\nany event, whether such evidence exists is a matter for the\ncourt to determine.\n   The second line of cases bearing on who decides the\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement, as the Court ex\nplains, involves the Prima Paint rule. See ante, at 6. That\nrule recognizes two types of validity challenges. One type\nchallenges the validity of the arbitration agreement itself,\non a ground arising from an infirmity in that agreement.\nThe other challenges the validity of the arbitration agree\nment tangentially\u2014via a claim that the entire contract (of\nwhich the arbitration agreement is but a part) is invalid\nfor some reason. See Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444. Under\nPrima Paint, a challenge of the first type goes to the court;\na challenge of the second type goes to the arbitrator. See\n388 U. S., at 403\u2013404; see also Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 444\u2013\n445. The Prima Paint rule is akin to a pleading standard,\nwhereby a party seeking to challenge the validity of an\narbitration agreement must expressly say so in order to\nget his dispute into court.\n   In sum, questions related to the validity of an arbitra\ntion agreement are usually matters for a court to resolve\nbefore it refers a dispute to arbitration. But questions of\narbitrability may go to the arbitrator in two instances: (1)\nwhen the parties have demonstrated, clearly and unmis\ntakably, that it is their intent to do so; or (2) when the\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement depends exclusively\non the validity of the substantive contract of which it is a\npart.\n                              II\n   We might have resolved this case by simply applying the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconduct. Respondents in that case had participated in the arbitration,\nbut only to object to proceeding in arbitration and to challenge the\narbitrators\u2019 jurisdiction. That kind of participation\u2014in protest, to\npreserve legal claims\u2014did not constitute unmistakable assent to be\nbound by the result. Id., at 946\u2013947.\n6            RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nFirst Options rule: Does the arbitration agreement at\nissue \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d evince petitioner\u2019s and\nrespondent\u2019s intent to submit questions of arbitrability to\nthe arbitrator?6 The answer to that question is no. Re\nspondent\u2019s claim that the arbitration agreement is uncon\nscionable undermines any suggestion that he \u201cclearly\u201d and\n\u201cunmistakably\u201d assented to submit questions of arbitrabil\nity to the arbitrator. See Restatement (Second) of Con\ntracts \u00a7208, Comment d (1979) (\u201c[G]ross inequality of\nbargaining power, together with terms unreasonably\nfavorable to the stronger party, may confirm indications\nthat the transaction involved elements of deception or\ncompulsion, or may show that the weaker party had no\nmeaningful choice, no real alternative, or did not in fact\nassent or appear to assent to the unfair terms\u201d); American\nAirlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, 249 (1995)\n(O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart) (\u201c[A] determination that a contract is \u2018unconscion\nable\u2019 may in fact be a determination that one party did not\nintend to agree to the terms of the contract\u201d).7 The fact\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 Respondenthas challenged whether he \u201cmeaningfully agreed to the\nterms of the form Agreement to Arbitrate, which he contends is proce\ndurally and substantively unconscionable.\u201d 581 F. 3d 912, 917 (CA9\n2009). Even if First Options relates only to \u201cmanifestations of intent,\u201d\nas the Court states, see ante, at 5\u20136, n. 1 (emphasis deleted), whether\nthere has been meaningful agreement surely bears some relation to\nwhether one party has manifested intent to be bound to an agreement.\n   7 The question of unconscionability in this case is one of state law.\n\nSee, e.g., Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483, 492, n. 9 (1987). Under\nNevada law, unconscionability requires a showing of \u201c \u2018both procedural\nand substantive unconscionability,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cless evidence of substantive\nunconscionability is required in cases involving great procedural\nunconscionability.\u201d D.

I understand respondent to have claimed,\nin accord with Nevada law, that the arbitration agreement contained\nsubstantively unconscionable provisions, and was also the product of\nprocedural unconscionability as a whole. See Brief for Respondent 3\n(\u201c[Respondent] argued that the clause is procedurally unconscionable\n                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthat the agreement\u2019s \u201cdelegation\u201d provision suggests\nassent is beside the point, because the gravamen of re\nspondent\u2019s claim is that he never consented to the terms in\nhis agreement.\n   In other words, when a party raises a good-faith validity\nchallenge to the arbitration agreement itself, that issue\nmust be resolved before a court can say that he clearly and\nunmistakably intended to arbitrate that very validity\nquestion. This case well illustrates the point: If respon\ndent\u2019s unconscionability claim is correct\u2014i.e., if the terms\nof the agreement are so one-sided and the process of its\nmaking so unfair\u2014it would contravene the existence of\nclear and unmistakable assent to arbitrate the very ques\ntion petitioner now seeks to arbitrate. Accordingly, it is\nnecessary for the court to resolve the merits of respon\ndent\u2019s unconscionability claim in order to decide whether\nthe parties have a valid arbitration agreement under \u00a72.\nOtherwise, that section\u2019s preservation of revocation issues\nfor the Court would be meaningless.\n   This is, in essence, how I understand the Court of Ap\npeals to have decided the issue below. See 581 F. 3d 912,\n917 (CA9 2009) (\u201c[W]e hold that where, as here, a party\nchallenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable,\nand thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nbecause he was in a position of unequal bargaining power when it was\nimposed as a condition of employment\u201d); id., at 3\u20134 (identifying three\ndistinct provisions of the agreement that were substantively uncon\nscionable); accord, 581 F. 3d, at 917.\n  Some of respondent\u2019s arguments, however, could be understood as\nattacks not on the enforceability of the agreement as a whole but\nmerely on the fairness of individual contract terms. Such term-specific\nchallenges would generally be for the arbitrator to resolve (at least so\nlong as they do not go to the identity of the arbitrator or the ability of a\nparty to initiate arbitration). Cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts\n\u00a7208 (1979) (providing that \u201ca contract or term thereof [may be] uncon\nscionable\u201d and that in the latter case \u201cthe remainder of the contract\nwithout the unconscionable term\u201d may be enforced).\n8            RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nthe agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability\nis for the court\u201d). I would therefore affirm its judgment,\nleaving, as it did, the merits of respondent\u2019s unconscion\nability claim for the District Court to resolve on remand.\n                             III\n   Rather than apply First Options, the Court takes us\ndown a different path, one neither briefed by the parties\nnor relied upon by the Court of Appeals. In applying\nPrima Paint, the Court has unwisely extended a \u201cfantas\ntic\u201d and likely erroneous decision. 388 U. S., at 407\n(Black, J., dissenting).8\n   As explained at the outset, see supra, at 3\u20137, this case\nlies at a seeming crossroads in our arbitration jurispru\ndence. It implicates cases such as First Options, which\naddress whether the parties intended to delegate ques\ntions of arbitrability, and also those cases, such as Prima\nPaint, which address the severability of a presumptively\nvalid arbitration agreement from a potentially invalid\ncontract. The question of \u201cWho decides?\u201d\u2014arbitrator or\ncourt\u2014animates both lines of cases, but they are driven by\ndifferent concerns. In cases like First Options, we are\nconcerned with the parties\u2019 intentions. In cases like Prima\nPaint, we are concerned with how the parties challenge\nthe validity of the agreement.\n   Under the Prima Paint inquiry, recall, we consider\nwhether the parties are actually challenging the validity\nof the arbitration agreement, or whether they are chal\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 Justice Black quite reasonably characterized the Court\u2019s holding in\n\nPrima Paint as \u201cfantastic,\u201d id., at 407 (dissenting opinion), because the\nholding was, in his view, inconsistent with the text of \u00a72 of the FAA,\n388 U. S., at 412, as well as the intent of the draftsmen of the legisla\ntion, id., at 413\u2013416. Nevertheless, the narrow holding in that case has\nbeen followed numerous times, see Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v.\nCardegna, 546 U. S. 440 (2006), and Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346\n(2008), and, as the Court correctly notes today, neither party has asked\nus to revisit those cases, ante, at 6.\n                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)             9\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nlenging, more generally, the contract within which an\narbitration clause is nested. In the latter circumstance,\nwe assume there is no infirmity per se with the arbitration\nagreement, i.e., there are no grounds for revocation of the\narbitration agreement itself under \u00a72 of the FAA. Accord\ningly, we commit the parties\u2019 general contract dispute to\nthe arbitrator, as agreed.\n   The claim in Prima Paint was that one party would not\nhave agreed to contract with the other for services had it\nknown the second party was insolvent (a fact known but\nnot disclosed at the time of contracting). 388 U. S., at 398.\nThere was, therefore, allegedly fraud in the inducement of\nthe contract\u2014a contract which also delegated disputes to\nan arbitrator. Despite the fact that the claim raised would\nhave, if successful, rendered the embedded arbitration\nclause void, the Court held that the merits of the dispute\nwere for the arbitrator, so long as the claim of \u201cfraud in\nthe inducement\u201d did not go to validity of \u201cthe arbitration\nclause itself.\u201d Id., at 403 (emphasis added). Because, in\nPrima Paint, \u201cno claim ha[d] been advanced by Prima\nPaint that [respondent] fraudulently induced it to enter\ninto the agreement to arbitrate,\u201d and because the arbitra\ntion agreement was broad enough to cover the dispute, the\narbitration agreement was enforceable with respect to the\ncontroversy at hand. Id., at 406.\n   The Prima Paint rule has been denominated as one\nrelated to severability. Our opinion in Buckeye, set out\nthese guidelines:\n    \u201cFirst, as a matter of substantive federal arbitration\n    law, an arbitration provision is severable from the\n    remainder of the contract. Second, unless the chal\n    lenge is to the arbitration clause itself, the issue of the\n    contract\u2019s validity is considered by the arbitrator in\n    the first instance.\u201d 546 U. S., at 445\u2013446.\nWhether the general contract defense renders the entire\n10          RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nagreement void or voidable is irrelevant. Id., at 446. All\nthat matters is whether the party seeking to present the\nissue to a court has brought a \u201cdiscrete challenge,\u201d Preston\nv. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 354 (2008), \u201cto the validity of the\n. . . arbitration clause.\u201d Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 449.\n    Prima Paint and its progeny allow a court to pluck from\na potentially invalid contract a potentially valid arbitra\ntion agreement. Today the Court adds a new layer of\nseverability\u2014something akin to Russian nesting dolls\u2014\ninto the mix: Courts may now pluck from a potentially\ninvalid arbitration agreement even narrower provisions\nthat refer particular arbitrability disputes to an arbitra\ntor. See ante, at 6\u20137. I do not think an agreement to\narbitrate can ever manifest a clear and unmistakable\nintent to arbitrate its own validity. But even assuming\notherwise, I certainly would not hold that the Prima Paint\nrule extends this far.\n    In my view, a general revocation challenge to a stand\nalone arbitration agreement is, invariably, a challenge to\nthe \u201c \u2018making\u2019 \u201d of the arbitration agreement itself, Prima\nPaint, 388 U. S., at 403, and therefore, under Prima Paint,\nmust be decided by the court. A claim of procedural un\nconscionability aims to undermine the formation of the\narbitration agreement, much like a claim of unconscion\nability aims to undermine the clear-and-unmistakable\nintent requirement necessary for a valid delegation of a\n\u201cdiscrete\u201d challenge to the validity of the arbitration agree\nment itself, Preston, 552 U. S., at 354. Moreover, because\nwe are dealing in this case with a challenge to an inde\npendently executed arbitration agreement\u2014rather than a\nclause contained in a contract related to another subject\nmatter\u2014any challenge to the contract itself is also, neces\nsarily, a challenge to the arbitration agreement.9 They are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 As respondent asserted in his opposition to petitioner\u2019s motion to\n\ncompel arbitration, \u201cthe lack of mutuality regarding the type of claims\n                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                   11\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\none and the same.\n   The Court, however, reads the delegation clause as a\ndistinct mini-arbitration agreement divisible from the\ncontract in which it resides\u2014which just so happens also to\nbe an arbitration agreement. Ante, at 6\u20137. Although the\nCourt simply declares that it \u201cmakes no difference\u201d that\nthe underlying subject matter of the agreement is itself an\narbitration agreement, ante, at 7, that proposition does not\nfollow from\u2014rather it is at odds with\u2014Prima Paint\u2019s\nseverability rule.\n   Had the parties in this case executed only one contract,\non two sheets of paper\u2014one sheet with employment\nterms, and a second with arbitration terms\u2014the contract\nwould look much like the one in Buckeye. There would be\nsome substantive terms, followed by some arbitration\nterms, including what we now call a delegation clause\u2014\ni.e., a sentence or two assigning to the arbitrator any\ndisputes related to the validity of the arbitration provi\nsion. See Buckeye, 546 U. S., at 442. If respondent then\ncame into court claiming that the contract was illegal as a\nwhole for some reason unrelated to the arbitration provi\nsion, the Prima Paint rule would apply, and such a gen\neral challenge to the subject matter of the contract would\ngo to the arbitrator. Such a challenge would not call into\nquestion the making of the arbitration agreement or its\ninvalidity per se.\n   Before today, however, if respondent instead raised a\nchallenge specific to \u201cthe validity of the agreement to\narbitrate\u201d\u2014for example, that the agreement to arbitrate\nwas void under state law\u2014the challenge would have gone\nto the court. That is what Buckeye says. See 546 U. S., at\n444. But the Court now declares that Prima Paint\u2019s plead\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nthat must be arbitrated, the fee provision, and the discovery provision, \n\nso permeate the Defendant\u2019s arbitration agreement that it would be\n\nimpossible to sever the offending provisions.\u201d App. 45. \n\n12         RENT-A-CENTER, WEST, INC. v. JACKSON\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ning rule requires more: A party must lodge a challenge\nwith even greater specificity than what would have satis\nfied the Prima Paint Court. A claim that an entire arbi\ntration agreement is invalid will not go to the court unless\nthe party challenges the particular sentences that delegate\nsuch claims to the arbitrator, on some contract ground\nthat is particular and unique to those sentences. See ante,\nat 8\u201310.\n   It would seem the Court reads Prima Paint to require,\nas a matter of course, infinite layers of severability: We\nmust always pluck from an arbitration agreement the\nspecific delegation mechanism that would\u2014but for present\njudicial review\u2014commend the matter to arbitration, even\nif this delegation clause is but one sentence within one\nparagraph within a standalone agreement. And, most\nimportantly, the party must identify this one sentence and\nlodge a specific challenge to its validity. Otherwise, he\nwill be bound to pursue his validity claim in arbitration.\n   Even if limited to separately executed arbitration\nagreements, however, such an infinite severability rule is\ndivorced from the underlying rationale of Prima Paint.\nThe notion that a party may be bound by an arbitration\nclause in a contract that is nevertheless invalid may be\ndifficult for any lawyer\u2014or any person\u2014to accept, but this\nis the law of Prima Paint. It reflects a judgment that the\n\u201c \u2018national policy favoring arbitration,\u2019 \u201d Preston, 552 U. S.,\nat 353, outweighs the interest in preserving a judicial\nforum for questions of arbitrability\u2014but only when ques\ntions of arbitrability are bound up in an underlying dis\npute. Prima Paint, 388 U. S., at 404. When the two are so\nbound up, there is actually no gateway matter at all: The\nquestion \u201cWho decides\u201d is the entire ball game. Were a\ncourt to decide the fraudulent inducement question in\nPrima Paint, in order to decide the antecedent question of\nthe validity of the included arbitration agreement, then it\nwould also, necessarily, decide the merits of the underly\n                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ning dispute. Same, too, for the question of illegality in\nBuckeye; on its way to deciding the arbitration agree\nment\u2019s validity, the court would have to decide whether\nthe contract was illegal, and in so doing, it would decide\nthe merits of the entire dispute.\n   In this case, however, resolution of the unconscionability\nquestion will have no bearing on the merits of the underly\ning employment dispute. It will only, as a preliminary\nmatter, resolve who should decide the merits of that dis\npute. Resolution of the unconscionability question will,\nhowever, decide whether the arbitration agreement itself\nis \u201cvalid\u201d under \u201csuch grounds as exist at law or in equity\nfor the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U. S. C. \u00a72. As\nPrima Paint recognizes, the FAA commits those gateway\nmatters, specific to the arbitration agreement, to the\ncourt. 388 U. S., at 403\u2013404. Indeed, it is clear that the\npresent controversy over whether the arbitration agree\nment is unconscionable is itself severable from the merits\nof the underlying dispute, which involves a claim of em\nployment discrimination. This is true for all gateway\nmatters, and for this reason Prima Paint has no applica\ntion in this case.\n                            IV\n   While I may have to accept the \u201cfantastic\u201d holding in\nPrima Paint, id., at 407 (Black, J., dissenting), I most\ncertainly do not accept the Court\u2019s even more fantastic\nreasoning today. I would affirm the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals, and therefore respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
